1,Another Blow for Public Education,"I will admit that the honesty of the teenage reviewers is notonly dead-on, but at the same time, hilarious and disheartening....Ithought a lot of the standard classics, by anyone's standards, they had me read in high school were pretty boring, but now this? Fortunately, around 11th grade we started getting some works of substance and literary merit and I went on to a Ph.D in Comparative Literature. I may not use it, but I've read a lot of books and of all the possibilities on the shelf, this is what the educational system chooses to have kids read. Pretty sad. And even sadder is that these kids cut close to the bone."
1,Why the Caged Bird Sings,I began reading this book with great participation with the writer. But as it progressed it became a disgusting and embarrassing portrayal (betrayal) of all the black people. I hope that society doesn't confuse this writing with the true and moral family oriented black america.
1,Trendy nonexistant issues,"Once the trendy women's issues are cleared aside, there is absolutely no literary merit to this book. People just like to look at certain issues and pretend like they are a problem because of the fact that they are not a problem. If there is no problem then no actual work is involved. You can just say that you were a part of something, possibly something great, because 20 years after there actually was a problem you recognized it. Maya Angelou is no different. I feel no sorrow for her. I found this book to be empty and meaningless."
4,The whole picture,"Maya Angelou has written a touching memoir based on a difficult child hood where the quality of one's character was based on the color of his/her skin. Growing up in an unfair society leads anyone, especially a child of Angelous age, to be contemptful. ""I know why the cage bird sings"" is not a racist novel or hypocritical because cruelty prokes hatred and this hatred was oppressed until equality was gained. Maya's spitfulness towards Whites was not innate. Maya is a beautiful writer and has a unique candor in expressing her feelings. I'm not African American but I can relate to her emotions and believe her novel is well written with true style - ultimatly producing a beautiful novel. Unfortunatly - the ending was a little rushed compared to the rest of her memoir. ~15 yrs. female"
4,Daena A.k.A *Dae*Dae* Truman high school,"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was a very interesting book. It allows you to understand the events and things that African Americans had to go through in the South. Also, it was basically an autobiography of Maya Angelou's life. The book takes you through twists and turns that Maya went through. It allows you to see how Maya went from being a child to being a strong black woman. It explains anything you might have wanted to know about Maya Angelou. It seems as if the book brings to life the events that occurred. It makes you feel as if you were right there next to Maya. I would recommend this to book to anyone who likes to read and is trying to find themselves."
4,I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings Review,"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings tells how Maya Angelou first arrived in the small town of Stamps, Arkansas when she was three and her brother, Bailey was four. She spent her childhood years here with her grandmother. Her life was never exciting until her father took her out west to see her mother. From that point on in her life, Maya had many experiences as she traveled around seeing her mother, father, and her grandmother back in Stamps. The story ends with Maya living with her mother in California now transformed from a child to a woman.I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings possesses Maya Angelou's distinctive poetic style. One can create clear mental images from the descriptions. Maya Angelou also does a great job of making the characters and their emotions come alive. Not only does one enjoy reading this book, but he will also learn many lessons from Maya Angelou's fascinating life."
4,I Know Why the CAGED BIRD Sings . dgkraemer@charter.net,An interesting story about the authors young life. I am very impressed with the fact that she took charge of her own life
5,Maya. What else need be said?,"I bought this for my niece for a Christmas present from her Amazon wish list. It's Maya Angelou, people. That's all you need to know."
4,"Review: I know why the caged bird sings""",I have heard about this book for a long time but am just now getting around to reading it. I have been an Angelou fan for years and the autobiography gives an interesting perspective about this heroic woman.
4,Powerful and Inspirational Memoir,"This is a lyrically written, powerful autobiography of a young black woman and her life in 1940's south. She suffers sexual abuse, poverty and abandonment yet she endures and grows, grasping life with a verve and intellect that catapults her through the future. It is a truly inspirational story.Unfortunately, it ends with her teen pregnancy and subsequent birth of her son. One wonders how she can be a mother while still a child herself."
2,disappointed in the omission of the section on Mrs. Flowers,"As an eighth grade reading teacher, I purchased the audio version hoping that my class could hear Maya Angelou read the section on Mrs. Flowers when we finished reading it in our text ('Lean on Me' - D. C. Heath and Company). Unfortunately, buying abridged works in any form is risky business. My low rating is not by any means a reflection of Maya Angelou's work, but a reflection of the material choosen by Random House to include in the audiobook on CD."
2,"OK, But Nothing Special","My high-school English teacher had this on her list of required reading for her senior class, and as a result, I didn't read it until after I had graduated from college. On the whole, I found it a rather dull book. Angelou goes into detail about what it was like for a young black girl to grow up in the United States in the 40's. As you can imagine, it wasn't really very pretty. She mentions about how she very eagerly lost her virginity, was molested by her mother's boyfriend, he relationship with her brother and so on. The most impressive part of the book was when she stood up for herself in order to get her first job -- the book is almost worth reading just for those few pages. But for the most part, I just couldn't get interested in it. I found it rather dull."
2,I'm not Singing,"It would have been a meager attempt even if the blatant narrative was substantial, even though this story of Maya's convoluted life may be a desperate plea of painful expression. But, as far as the actual meaning of this book, this bird dies in captivity."
2,Surprisingly Boring,"I'm sorry, but I found this book to be boring and hard to believe. Much of the time Maya appears to be over-stating her point and the events surrounding her life. I did not finish the book.I know that Maya is a revered poet, as she should be. But this book does not do her justice."
1,I hated this book,"I hate how Maya Angelou thinks she's such a victim and tries to steal everyone's sympathy in a verbose piece of garbage. There are about a million lives right now that are much worse than hers but she acts like she has persevered the most racism and injustice in the world. She puts in about thiry big words for ""opression"" and ""racism"" and acts like she has reached sainthood. All this book is, is a self praisal (i forgot how to spell that)."
1,"One of the worst books I have ever, ever, EVER read","Usually I enjoy reading book. Usually. But in this book my interest just fell apart. This is the first book in years I had to FORCE myself to read. (It was required for school). The style and narrative were completely absurd. Many chapters had nothing to do with the chapters before and after it. In short, the book wasted words. Thus, the narrative got lost and left me COMPLETELY UNTOUCHED."
2,Caged Bird Book Review,"In truth, i thought this book was DREADFUL. There was a lot of hype surruonding this book, and i was excited to read it for an english assignment. I was Very disappointed. This book is boring, slow,and downright tedious. This book was easy to understand, but is overshadowed by the boring plot. As horrible as this sounds, the most interesting part of the book was the rape and molestation, but even that contained bland descriptions and was NOT even that good. I give this book two stars out of respect to Maya Angelou, but I did not find this book interesting or stimulating in the least bit."
2,I thing the caged bird should stop singing racist songs!!!,"God forbit if the racism in this book was vice-versa. Ms. Angelo has a beautiful writing talent but she describes whites with the most disgusting way! I understand that she had lots of bad childhood memories but you feel the hatred toward white not the hatred toward those days' racist,NO! the hatred toward whites!I hate discrimination and racism against any race doesn't matter, black, white, Asian, Hispanic or Native-Americans and this is why I stopped reading this book as soon as I felt it is full of hatred and rage!God Bless Oprah for making whomever she wants rich! I don't know if Maya's books would have so many readers if Oprah wouldn't advertise for her!"
5,this book helped me understand my feelings it is wonderful,"I read this book long ago and just recently became aware of its meaning. Sometimes it takes a while to sink in. ""I know why a caged bird sings"". It is because it makes them happy in an unhappy situation"
4,"Good, enjoyable and sad",The best word I could use to best describe the contents of this book is SAD. It is well written and makes you fell great compassion for the main character. It is a very moving book and disturbingly realistic. A must read.
5,Jill,The book was in excellent condition. Maya Angelou is an amazing author! Her talent for descriptiveness is refreshing and so vivid!!
2,Parents Beware,"Although the writing in this book is wonderful, parents of high school students need to be aware that Ms. Angelou is raped at age 8 and has very graphically described it. .... That's why I'm writing, so you will know that despite the good there is in this book, it is certainly for a mature audience."
2,a questioning cliche,"Once again this book was on the book list for our Literature class. It's a very inviting book, with a large text and an endearing child narrator whose strange quirks and expressions give it a very personal and all the more emotional touch. It certainly highlights the racial division prevalent in the South (USA) as recently as 50-60 years ago. This coming of age story though falls (not through any fault of Angelou's) into another cliche story about 'black' people and the struggle and oppression they endured. I do not mean to trivialize their struggle merely to highlight the fact that after one reads hundreds of books on the same little black girl who got raped by her white stepdaddy or whatever, the stories blur into one and the only difference is their name.Would I recommend it? Only if you haven't been exposed with 'To kill a mockingbird'-esque stories beforehand."
2,I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings,I thought this book was a good representation of the trials and tribulations of a young black girl growing up in the mid 20th century. However it was extremely boring and the only reason I kept reading it was because I had to read it for English Class. It was difficult to follow and the content may be inappropriate to younger readers.
1,EASILY THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ,"Everyone seems to think that Maya Angelou is a great author. In my opinion, there has never been a worse book written. Even the style of writing put me to sleep. If I were reading a good story, written in her style, I wouldn't enjoy it. Usually I only use these reviews to say how good many books are, but I felt that this one was bad enough to warrant warning the world about what an awful piece of literature it is."
2,Inspirational? Yes. Exciting? No.,"I think this book was inspirational but honestly ... it was so boring a pretty much feel asleep within the first thirty pages. For adventure seekers, this is a ""no-no."""
4,i LIKE THIS BOOK AND i AM CURRENTLY DOING RESEARCH PAPER.,PLEASE SEND ANY INFORMATION THAT WILL BE USEFUL IN DOING MY RESEARCH PAPER i AM HAVING A VERY HARD TIME. THANKS bRIDGET sIMPSON a STUDENT AT WAYNE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL IN WAYNESBORO ms
1,a horrible book,"i remember reading this book in high school. it ... i know that sounds harsh, but that's the truth. maya angelou wrote this book to try to make an excuse for the fact that she was a hooker. she blames all her mistakes and problems on society and racism, and the writing isn't even good. her below-subpar autobiography is filled with nonsensical similes that she merits as good writing (ie. ""he threw his words at us like bricks, and some of them sunk in me""). when i was done reading this garbage, i thought racism ... but that it wasn't to blame for her horrible decisions in life. in my opinion, maya angelou is nothing more than someone who falsely envisions herself as the mary magdalen."
1,pure crap,This book is just horrible. NEVER READ IT!!!!!!!! Its that bad. This book just drags on and the chapters just have no impact to the book. Skip it at all costs. Please do not read this book.
1,Garbage,This book sucked... It is boring as hell. I would NOT reccomend this book to anyone. Please never pick this book up if you see it. If you do see this book anywhere in sight burn it.
3,YAWN...............,BELEIVE ME THIS BOOK WILL BORE YOU TO DEATH. THE ONLY REASON IM READING IT IS FOR MY 9TH GRADE ENGLISH CLASS. IF YOU HAVE TO READ THIS BOOK FOR SCHOOL JUST RENT THE MOVIE SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND HOURS READING SO YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS ON THE PHONE.
4,Bittersweet,"A positive story of a difficult childhood, from childbirth to childbirth. Swirling people, events and environment, but a young girl who is focused, advancing and making sense of a world that is not designed to help her.In spite of the seriously negative tone, atmosphere and events, this is an uplifting story of the human possibility in every person, no matter what their source or upbringing.This is not the Great American Novel, but it has a place in sharing one portion of the American Experience."
3,Good but not great.,"I don't mind saying that I feel a bit guilty for not falling in love with this book. Regardless, I did find it to be entertaining at times and provides good lessons for women of color or anybody who experiences any form of discrimination. I did find the book to be a bit slow and sometimes boring. I do think it's important for people to read this book in order to feel what it's like to be looked down upon because of your skin color. For that it is a work of art."
4,wonderful read,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It's the first thing by Maya that I've read. She's very wordy, but it was still easy to read. Highly recommend it. I'll now be looking for her other books."
2,"Good, but too narcissistic","Ok, we all know Ms. Angelou is a good poet, but why do we have to read those self-flattering adjectives and phrases every two pages? We all admire the way she made from the far black south to the middle of the white-American consensus, but why do we have to read this shallow, one-sided and pointless description of white people and ""stupid"" people who didn't realize her brilliance ? Sometimes poeple tend to cover their amazing achievements by being too radical (in the bad sence of the word, namely, a total lack of balanced point of view) and thus turn their interesting stories into a bad science-fictional novella. It's such a shame Ms. Angelou, who is a sensitive poet, failed to reach this simple insight."
4,Beautifully Written,"I loved this book. Written very simply and straightfoward, yet poetic. It drew me in almost immediately. Only complaint is that it left me wanting more information. For example, Maya and her brother had been incredibly close and were the only constant in each other's lives, but at one point they live apart and there is no mention of how this separation impacted either one of them. At several points in the memoir, I had questions like this that were never resolved. But overall I would definitely recommend. Maya has a unique and beautiful voice."
5,A Lifetime of Memories,"I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou is one of the best books I have read. This story takes place back in Arkanasas. It's about a brother and a sister who are left with the image of a horrible past. They go through so many tragedgies yet grow up to become a respectable author,which is true for Maya's case. This book is a symbolism for freedom of race or ethnicity or freedom of individuality. -Joan"
5,Very informing,"I like this story because it tells me of my past history. The story is very imformative. I think it is a wonderful biography and it is well detailed. It travels from her childhood to her adulthood, showing her trials and tribulations."
4,Struggles and Strength,"This autobiography portrays the young, insecure, Marguerite Johnson, Maya, growing up in the segregated town of Stamps, Arkansas. She was precious, imaginative and felt as though she was misunderstood and lived in a society of hatefulness. Maya was immersed in a world of racism but kept her grandmother and mother as her source of strength. Maya's varying environments helped shape her into the determined women she is today."
3,An interesting but not especially intriguing journey,"Maya Angelou chronicles the first sixteen years of her life in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the first of three installments of her life story. Beginning in dusty Stamps, Arkansas and eventually ending in glamourous San Francisco (while visiting exciting St. Louis and imposing Mexico in between) Angelou pivots her childhood chronicle around youth's joy and tribulations. Alternating between comedy and tragedy, Angelou's work reads like a treasured bedtime story on a chilly evening, blanket and cocoa included. Words are expertly manipulated in order to produce fascinating accounts of otherwise plebeian events. However, the book's Achilles heel likes in these very events; only so many beautifully unique ways exist to explain daily life, and much to the language's avail, the book suffers for it. Still, in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou produced a vivid portrait of life in the slow deep South in the 1930s."
5,"Very Realistic,Spiritual,and Uplifting","Tells the story of a young, black girl and her older brother trying to survive in Stamps Arkansas with their grandmother and their mentally ill uncle.This girl and her family goes down a rough road,but her faith is strong a comes out defeating the demons that tried to stop her and her family from living the life the always wanted...being together."
4,I've read some of the book before and saw a little of the mo,"I would like you to email me a summary or review of the book or give me a web address that I can go to, to get some info on the book. (info for a book repot)"
3,A sad story that ends good!,"This Book was very good, Maya had an interesting life. Well to bad it wasn't all. The think about it is why does it have to have embrassing parts making you think all white people will do something like that!"
5,"Great reading, eye opening and touching.",Maya writes with true honesty. It is very easy to relate to her feelings and emotions.The use of her words and real life experiences are surprising and unexpected. I suggest reading all of her autobiographies. It is really an eye opening experience. The honesty in her work is what makes her reading so interesting. She tells it how it was and like it is. The use of her words to send across her message is quite phenomonal. So is she.
1,Don't make students required to read it!,"This book is very boring to read. I have found myself falling to sleep reading it because she goes off in tangents that don't have to do anything about the book. There are many other books out there that follow this kind of theme, but are much better than this."
2,my book review 4 miss seviewx,"This book was ok, i wouldnt read if i didnt have to but b/c i had to, it deals w/ many themes that people can relate to. Segregation, racism, hate and naming. So if u have nutthin better 2 do w/ ur life than read book read this one."
1,I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,This was the worst book I have every read. It was so boring I fell asleep reading it. It had no point to her life. All she did was talk about her family and not her. I thought the book was about her.
3,Bet You had to Read this for School,"The frank narrative makes this book more interesting, but it didn't leave me caring that much. I respected Maya Angelou because of her extremely difficult life, but that didn't mean I wanted to hear about it."
3,"Had to read it for school, good overall","In my county there has been talk of banning this book, and it actually was last year. This year, however, they put it back in the curriculum. I wasn't overly crazy about the book, but I have to say Mrs. Angelou is a wonderful writer. I agree with the themes in this book, and share Maya's ideals, but the book didn't really catch my interest. It's not like I don't like to read or anything (cause I love to) but for some reason it didn't enthral me. Its probably more of a womans book. l also find it a funny choice for a bunch of white, upper middle class suburbian teens to have read, and then act suprised when they hate the book. I also find no reason to ban the book. The rape scene wasn't at all handled bad. Also, the whole book has a rather sour taste to it now after having to take a million pages of notes on it."
4,an insite into life in the 1940's,"This book is our class's GCSE Novel and i am glad it was as it is an interesting piece and not only did it tell us of one womans stuggle, but it taught us the true extent of the trouble the blacks went through. This book shows one woman come up against everthing bad and cope. Maya Angelou should be an inspiration to all young woman who are trying to make it alone in the world."
2,BOTTOM LINE,"This review comes to you from a 15 year old male. If you are assigned this book, I suggest you read it to pass tests, etc., since it isn't too long. Don't read it if you don't have to. The story has absolutely no plot and when I reached the end I was asking myself ""Where's the story?"". No wonder, it comes from one of Oprah's close friends. Email me your comments."
3,I know why the caged bird sings.,This book is a very good and brilliant book from a talented author.The plot is excellant. Maya knows how to tell a story.I recomend her book to all readers.
4,posting for Deseante Jones,"This was a great book. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes to red in gerneral. It pin points the views of many different generations, especially a young blk girl growing up in the south. It also shows the many deprivations of blks. And lastly the racist experiences that blks had to face as well as the trials + tribulations."
3,I know why the caged bird sings,"I know why the caged bird sings is a book about a small hometown back many years ago when there was still racism. This book was very calm, just about the blacks life when they were hated for nothing. This book was written by Maya Angelou.A girl named Maya is telling her life story, she starts off by telling about herself then about a woman named Barbara Flowers, and she is the owner of a small shop. As the story goes through it just has many people going in and out of the store and telling what the black people had to do and how the white people treated them because of their skin colors.Kelsey Allen"
2,INAPPROPRIATE FOR YOUTH.,"I read with my daughter who is in the 7th grade. Her teacher assigned to read as a book report. The students had to write about symbols, motifs, etc. and compare them to personal life experiences. But, as we read together, the words were very graphic beginning around ( i believe chapter going forward ) describing the rape by Maya mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman. The book stated that his private part "" stood up like a piece of corn "". This is not a "" youth friendly book "". PARENTS : Take time to read with your children. I gave two stars because there were funny, interesting points in the book at teh beginning. Other than that, INAPPROPRIATE !"
1,For Student Use,"I am high school student. I had a very hard time reading this book. I know many people say that it is great, but I would not suggest reading this for student use. Some of the book was great but most of the time it lost me. This is a book I would read when I am an adult but not now. It is too complicated for me and not something I would read everyday. However I did learn a few things about what Maya Angelou life is about and I think she is a most interesting person to read about."
5,well-written,"I am in the middle of reading this book for a college class and so far, it has proved to be a great read."
3,A Good book,""" I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings""is an autobiography of Mya Angelou. She speaks of her life, going through trials and heartaches. A major theme in this novel is racism. During Maya's childhood, she is looked upon as a lower class,black girl. She feels that blacks should stand up to the whites and shows this feeling in many ways. I would recommend this book to any generation. I think anyone can relate to it and be affected by it in some way."
2,WMF salt and pepper shakers,"The salt and pepper shakers are very contemporary. However, the small pepper shaker (which we use most) does NOT shake out very much pepper. It is a very light shake. To improve it would be to make the 2 holes larger. The Salt has 3 holes and shakes out perfect (however we use very little salt). I was a little dissapointed."
4,slick!,Looks great on yer table. But it does cost 10x more than a typical salt & pepper set... and it collects fingerprints like CRAZY. (You'll be washing it a lot.)
3,A 'fix' for the small hole problem,"This set gets 5 stars for form but 1 star for function. Yes, the holes are too small. The smaller shaker is particularly problematic. I improved the situation by putting the tip of a small nail (just slightly larger in diameter than the hole) into each hole and gently pounding it until I had slightly larger holes. The process didn't damage the product at all (but be careful)."
2,"Cool, but not super functional",The holes are pretty small so had to by different kind of salt for the shaker and both pepper and salt shaker require quiet a bit of work to get out the amount you want. Novel looking set.
2,Not worth the money,"I agree with much of what has been said here - the things are tiny, but that's OK, it makes them cute. The problem s the 2-holed pepper shaker -hardly any pepper comes out. We're not even using it it is so frustrating. So, $22 later, we're still shopping for a decent salt & pepper set."
2,"Looks nice, but pricey","I bought this for my home and while it looks excelelnt, it functions sub-satisfactorily,and its overpriced. Especially since its not German-made anymore. Don't bother purchasing."
1,Impractical,"Extremely beautiful product that gets the attention but does not do what it is intended to do. Salt shakers holes are so small that regular salt does not pour out of it, thus rendering that one waste for even pepper. The pepper shaker we used for salt, and even that had a difficut time coming out."
5,Love this set,"I bought mine in Germany 3 years ago to use on my dining room table and I and my husband (plus anyone who ever comes over) just love it! We have never had any issues with dispensing and it takes up no room on the table. I would recommend to anyone wanting not just a cool s&p shaker, but something that stands out that no one else has."
2,very small,"These are cute, but really small. The pepper in the middle is about as wide as your index finger and about half as tall of your finger. Very cute, but just really really small and will need to fill quite often if these are your day to day shakers."
3,Good,I like the different exercises on every other day- it worked out pretty well for me with my week days- but some of the info seems to be rehashed over and over again in his books.Some of the moves bothered my low back at times- morning vs the evening so I changed around the execersies it seem to work. Hope this helps.
3,National Physical Therapy Examination: Review and Study Guide,"I was somewhat disappointed because I thought that the book that I purchased was updated, but when I received the book, it was published 2006. I needed the 2007 or the 2008 version of the book. I wasn't able to return it back anymore because it was too late."
5,Best Instrumental Rock / Fusion Artist in History,"I am a guitar lunatic. After 25 years, I still can't stop buying guitar records. (I'm 43 now, I bought the CD 12 years ago) I have all the biggies, Vai, Satch, Greg Howe, Holdsworth, Garsed, Malmsteen, Verheyen, Morse, Petrucci, Kollman, Gambale, Jon Finn, many many more, why go on. I will say this once. SHAWN LANE IS THE BEST MUSICIAN TO EVER LIVE ON THIS PLANET. I never tire of it. It took a while to absorb, after listening to a million notes a minute albums of the late 80's but it grew and grew and grew on me. The depth of his music, the melodies, tone, speed, phrasing. The numerous influences make this record a smogasbord to the pallette. And to think he played every instrument himself, makes you realize that this man was not human, but some angel like alien given as a gift to the world. If you are a musician of any kind or like instument music, get the disk, and spend a little extra if you have to (remember, it's out of print). RIP Shawn"
5,strring made easy,I purchased my stirchef saucepan stirrer about a month and half ago. Its is very easy to set up and does a great job. I can leave it and do other things I need to do. I use it on every thing I cook in a pan. Going to get another one in case this one stopped. Everyone needs to try it.
2,Barely Passable,"The package arrived very quickly. However, the product is not what I would describe as fresh. Cotton Candy tends to shrink over time, unless the bags are completely airtight. The candy within the bags I received has shrunk to less than half of its original size and was not at all fluffy. Very disappointing."
2,Wrong Flavor,The description says that the cotton candy is blue raspberry and/or pina colada but when it arrived it was blue raspberry and pink vanilla. We bought this for my grandma who loves pina colada so it was rather disappointing when it arrived without that flavor.
2,cheap plastic collar,"I liked this lamp a lot when I got it and have it on my desk all the time. After a period of time, though, the collar holding the lamp itself onto the gooseneck cracked, and now the lamp just flops down. It won't stay up. Contacting the Daylight company was to no avail. ""We don't make this model any more and can't help you."" The lamp was useful, but sure made cheaply at the points where it should have been more durable. I also bought an extra bulb. I wish now I hadn't. Maybe it will fit in a new model? Do I want to spend another 100 bucks? I don't think so. I am not happy."
4,Light up my life,"I use my craft lamp several hours a day while I bead. The flexible arm makes it easy to find the optimal height, and the bulb doesn't get overly hot. My only complaint is with the magnifying glass, which is of poor quality. And the stem end doesn't fit well into the holder on the lamp."
3,Whatever Vs. Stupid,"I had Aimee's first solo album, Whatever, for many years before I ventured to get I'm With Stupid. I did not find that Stupid was able to grab my attention much, if at all (especially compared to how much I like Whatever). Maybe I just need to give it a few more listens, but I probably won't be inspired to do so for a good long while. My first impressions are that this album lacks something...I must say, I was rather dissapointed, but not enough to get rid of the album."
1,Love Aimee Mann but this is stupid!,"Each Aimee Mann album seems to get better...or so it seemed. Each of the three 'Til Tuesday albums was better than the one before but they sold less and less. Then as a solo artist, Mann shined on ""Whatever"". I was looking forward to ""I'm with Stupid"" but frankly, I hate it. I've tried to listen to it but it now just gathers dust in my scrap pile of cd's."
5,A Must Have,"""I'm with Stupid"" is simply great. Catchy tunes, wonderful voice, not a single poor song on the album. One of the best records I bought recently."
5,I love this cd!,"This is one of my favorite cd's! I love Aimee Mann's voice, lyrics, and the great guitars. I'm still trying to get a copy of Whatever, which I've heard is even better than I'm With Stupid Now, so I can't wait to get it!"
5,I've bought this album three times...,"...the first time was for myself, and it was one of those albums where you can't stop a song while its playing; I can only stop it when a song has ended. Well, the tape got lost, and I missed it now and then, thinking I might come across it again. But once I needed a birthday present for my sister so I bought it a second time. Finally, after hearing hers I bought it again for myself. Solid, well crafted pop songs from a gifted melody writer that will stick in your head and make you want to learn the lyrics so you can sing along."
5,Aimee Mann: the most articulate and important artist today,"When I'm going through a rough time, or even just a bad day, I turn to Aimee Mann's music. Not because it will necessarily cheer me up, but it's nice to know there's another voice out there that just 'gets' what I'm feeling. Aimee Mann writes about life, love, loss, just like everybody, sure. But her songs aren't filled with the cliches that most groups or artists have. Aimee is wonderful at juxtaposition and creating clever lines in songs. In 'I'm with Stupid', we have two radio-pop-friendly songs 'Frankenstein' and 'That's Just What You Are' that are so catchy, you wonder why they didn't go straight to the top of the charts. Oh, that's right, people today don't listen to good music. I forgot. If they did, they would check out this and Aimee's other albums."
2,Hard to use,"I'm a huge DDR Fan and play it fairly often. I bought this pad thinking it would be good enough to play at home but I was very wrong. The pad slides on the tile and rug very easily, making it hard to play the game. After about 2 songs, it makes your feed hurt a lot...specially if the pad is over the tile. I would certainly invest a bit more and get the metal pad."
3,do not order from family video!,"that's who i bought mine from, and what i recived isn't the dance pad shown above! It's the dance pad with the arrows in the corners instead of the X,O, square and triangle. once again, dont order from him."
5,Great Flying,"What I love about this movie is the flying. It's superb. Also, for Baby Boomers, this is history from the viewpoint of those who fought in what was a pointless meat grinder of people."
1,Not the movie. The movie seen previously is great.,This movie did not play in our dvd player. It is not for US players or in our district. I didn't notice anything onthe cover about a different area until we tried to play it.
5,Great Movie,I didnt think i would like this movie but i got watching it with my husband and it was actually a good movie.
2,"Good ""Popcorn"" Fare",Most of the dialogue is lame -- typical Milius comic book type characters. But Milius knows how to do action. The flight sequences are OK-- the downtown Hanoi minatures look too fake but I enjoyed watching it. It's like a saturday afternoon matinee feature.
1,ubc,i could not watch this dvd wrote to seller and never got a reponce when i put dvd in it says out of reigon never herd of this before i ordered this for a friend and had to give back his money wont be buying any more when you buy some thing and it sent to the state of mi. this must never happen if the person that sold this dvd reads this please send me the right one
2,Not the first pick for movie night,"Great book. Not so great movie and the small screen does not anything to this one either. With so many good and great war movies to choose from, this one can be saved for much later."
3,could have been a 10,"My favorite part of the film is when the Sky Raiders come flying down the valley.But had they stuck to the main story,The war, The air war, The bravery of the flight crews,and the cowardice and stupidity of the politicians, and a lot of the officers,This could have been a 10.But we were subjected to the fluff and filler that seems to be mandatory in so many films, and so painful to watch.My answer is to run the dvd through the computer and edit out the wasted time, and make a watchable, enjoyable film that honors these fine folks."
2,AVERAGE DRONE WITH DISCONNECTED WAR CLICHES,"Nearly everything about this Top Gun clone formula-flick seems to be borrowed, right down to the pilots' nicknames and its routine war themes of camaraderie, grace under pressure, a nervy disregard for any authority beyond your own conscience, etc etc. Whatever sparse moments of watchability the film produces come mostly from Will Dafoe, one of the many cowboy American soldiers armed with explosives. Passable."
2,Very poor actiing,This is almost a C movie. I think they put Danny Glover in there to attract people. Otherwise I would never have rented it.
5,Boomer Ord,This movie brought back fond memories of my days loading bombs for sorties on A6 Intruders launching off the deck of the Connie. Those were the days. This movie falls back to the month of December 1971 just before Nixon started operation Linebacker 2. We were the lead squadron that morning and launched Iron Hand early before sunrise in preparation for bombing Hanoi. RED shirts will live forever in History. Go Boomers
4,Could have been better . . .,"An interesting air war release. Not up to the high standards of MEMPHIS BELLE, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY, (upcoming movie based on the book)or old classics like 633 SQUADRON OR THE BLUE MAX, but there are few enough air war movies as it is so this one is worth watching."
5,It is a movie worthy of being in your collection,"I have this movie in my collection. I have watched it many times. As a combat veteran of Vietnam, 66/67, the movie did not answer the pilot's serious question. ""Why are we here."" However, I really don't think there is or was an answer to that question. It is a movie worth being in your collection."
1,Great Book - Bad Movie - Good Actors,"My view is skewed. I was in VA-196 and flew with Steve oonts a few times as a B/N. His book captured our collective squadron stories and placed the A6A Intruder into the public eye. People would tell me about their experiences while reading the book...they did not know my connection to it. Steve wrote so well that they could smell the cockpit and sense the adrenalin. While the movie paralleled our actual experiences at sea and in port, it did not convey the excitement of the book. So, I was disappointed in my expectations and give the film a good try.W. Stewart Tittle, Lt USNR 1966-71."
4,Blu-Ray Review,Bought my copy at my local Walmart for $10. Blu-Ray is better in most of the movie but still grainy in some parts. I've seen worse.
3,Did not read the book but the DVD is worth a look,I have never read the novel but the film is overall a fine tribute to the A-6 pilots who flew those dangerous missions over Vietnam in the early 1970s. It's worth it to buy or rent the DVD simply because you can skip to the excellent flying sequences. There-by avoiding the less interesting filler. Overall see it for the planes and the action.
1,BORING,I'm twenty six minutes into watching this movie.Where is this movie going? When does something happen?I think I'll find something else to do with my time.
4,The Nam,"I don't think this movie was intended to show what air combat is really like over the 'Nam, although Stephen Coonts, the author of the novel, ""The Flight ofthe Intruder"" did fly combat missions over vietnam. OK, Brad Johnson is a better pretty boy than actor and the FX can be cheesy but Dafoe is does his usual fine job and the story really picks up when he appears. This is the story of two guys who got fed up with risking their lives to bomb water buffalo and rice paddies and decided to take things into their on hands. Historically, the most amazing true fact depicted is that for political reasons the US allowed the North Vietnamese to have ""safe areas"" where they could stockpile weapons and equipment without fear of attack. This really happened in several different locations in the region. Hopefully we know better now. This is a story about doing the right thing even if it means breaking the rules, consequences, and redemption."
4,What I Remember,"I grew up with this movie, along with other things like Robot Jox and Top Gun. It's still the same war movie with two sailors feeling that what they do is pointless and gets men killed in vain. It was good to get to see this movie again, and it's definitely for the right region as it states."
5,Bought it used,I bought this movie used and not only was the case in great condition but so was the disc. Im very satisfied with my purchase.
4,great war movie,"This is 1980`s movie about vietnam, there is cool flight action,comedy,and more action.With an A list of actors.Well worth watching if you want to see a good war movie."
2,Flight of the Intruder DVD,Book was great but movie is very silly and shallow. I was very disgusted. Do not recommend buying this movie.
5,lots of action,This is one of those films that has you holding your breath from time to time. Lots of excitment and action.
1,Flight of the Intruder,"I was unable to get this DVD to read, it would not under any channel or setting, all the rest of the DVD's read fine, but this one would not. By any chance, may I have a replacement?? Please let me know at rfdpw@aol.com. Thank you. R. Deurloo."
3,Great -except for French subtitled text !,"Really like this movie,good solid Vietnam action flick except for one thing-how do you turn off the bold french subtext on the DVD,you can't of course if you live in Canada ! It's yellow & it's 3X as big as the English text Otherwise I would have given the movie 4 stars."
5,Johnson and Dafoe hit the mark,"I am an avid war historian, and althought this movie falls short of the reality of the vietnam conflict. The insaneness embraced by Johnson and Dafoe make this a must own for all movie buffs. In addition, it is really awful that this has not been released in DVD format as of yet from the studio."
2,Look at other books,I went to Melbourne and Sydney and the book turned out to be pretty skimpy. I flipped through the Fodor's book when I got home and wished I had bought that one instead. I found the Frommer's book to be very light on things to do and good places to eat for the 2 cities I visited. There isn't even a mention of Olympic Park in Sydney and only a handful of restaurants are mentioned. If you are only buying one book I would recommend checking out the Fodor's instead. It contains more thorough information and has good maps throughout for each city.
3,Out of date and missing info,"The trip was fantastic and I really enjoyed it, but this book didn't make it out of my bag when I was there. While a lot of the info was good, I used the Lonely Planet guide the whole time as it was more up to date and more accurate than Frommers."

It is much more thorough and has better maps throughout for each city.
2,Lame,"I thought this workout video was completely lame. I'm holding out hope that the postnatal is better than the prenatal. I'll find out in a couple of months. There was absolutely nothing challenging about it. Especially the yoga fat burn. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to lose weight, but I am trying to stay fit. Doing the same sequence of poses 6 TIMES and moving on to a stretching section is not my idea of a workout. BOR-ING! The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one star is becasue of the opening dance/cardio section. Cheesy, but effective in getting your heart rate up. This video needs variety - big time.If you want a real ""workout"" get The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1. If you want real yoga, get Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea."
2,Can only summarize it as BORING,I've ordered this product after reading its enthusiastic reviews.Must admit I don't share same impression ...I've only tried the prenatal DVD (both Salsa and Yoga) andit was nothing but BORING.Same exercise repeated over and over again through the whole workout.I've done it once and it was enough ...Lucky for me I've also ordered the Tracey Mallett's 3 in 1 Pregnancy Systemwhich was GREAT (I've wrote separate review on this one).
2,Boring,If you like doing the same moves over and over then this is the DVD for you. I got bored and only did the workout a couple of times.
5,Great prenatal video,"I have only done 3 of the 4 sections so far - the yoga, the stretching and labor and delivery section... but I have really enjoyed them. It was easy to follow and feels like a great workout!"
3,"It's okay, not great","I find the host rather annoying, but that's true for most workout videos. Setting that aside, the routines are quite repetitive, which is fine for a beginner but would probably be boring for someone looking for a more intense workout.I do like that there are two routines to choose from -- the salsa dance routine and the yoga routine (which is actually a decent workout compared to some other yoga dvds), so I can decide based on my mood which I'd rather do. I haven't gotten to the post-natal workout point yet, so I can't comment on that part of the set."
5,very satisfied customer,This came here in excellent condition and was here way sooner than i ever expected. Will definitaley order from this place again! although i could not muster up the energy to really do these consitently pregnant but that my fault not the videos it was easy to follow along to being pregannt still i am just lazy
3,Not for me,"Although it is a great DVD, it is not for me. This is made for a beginner to exercise, and someone who enjoys dancing. I did a lot of strenuous activity before I was pregnant and I felt that this dvd was way too mellow for me. The yoga in the prenatal workout was the best part, but was focused on leg work. The postnatal workout was much better, but again with the dancing. Not my favorite."
2,Good for beginners,"This DVD was a little too simple for me. It would be great for a beginner, but not for someone with years of experience doing aerobics."
3,o.k.,The video has a nice pre-labor section and the salsa routine is fun. The yoga though is very repetative and therefore a little boring. The video overall is nice in that it has you doing different variations according to trimesters.
3,"Good, but she moves way to fast for me.",I guess I was expecting something different. More like her going at a speed that I could keep up with!!! This dvd seems like it's for more advanced people not beginners although she does say that it's for anyone...not really!!
4,Benedict Arnold - traitor or hero?,This historical novel tries to show the noble side of Benedict Arnold in the run-up to the Revolutionary War. An interesting read.
5,THE BEST,"Combining a valid historic account, with an engaging, entertaining, well woven story; there is nothing better than this. Different, but none better.A classic not to be missed.A deep exposure to American history, and fun....Go for it!"
3,roberts always political,"This is a fine story of the American Revolution in the North, climaxing in the defeat of Burgoyne. Roberts is a realistic writer, whose sub-plots are rather juvenile. His Falstaffian character, Cap Huff, is eventually less than comic relief.Roberts hated the New Deal and devotes much space to political sermonizing.His books would be better without these homilies."
3,"Good, but not as good as Arundel","This book is an interesting and fun adventure back to the revolutionary world Roberts crated in Arundel and other books. Unfortunately, its just not as good as Arundel, probably because the narrator's character is not as interesting or endearing as Steven Nason was in Arundel.It's definitely worth reading, but if you are choosing between the two, read Arundel first."
2,I am very ambivalent about arnold,"benedict arnold should be respected,but there are people who should be respected more such as Thomas leffingwell and sam huntington"
5,The heroic side of Benedict Arnold,"Although we are all familiar with the traitor Benedict Arnold, many of us are unfamiliar with how much of a hero he was prior to his infamy. After reading this novel I gained an appreciation for Benedict Arnold that I would never have dreamed possible. Prior to this novel I read Robert's Northwest Passage and loved it. As a result I decided to read Rabble In Arms. More than glad I did. Arundel, Lydia Bailey, Oliver Wiswell are all in my queue. Kenneth Roberts has a following but unfortunately is overlooked or unknown by many."
3,Close but no cigar,"As many probably figured out by now, this is pretty much a rehash of the previous DVD release from DM. It's a rehash of Videos 86-98, and the extra short films and videos (E.G. But Not Tonight) is pretty much what you're shelling out the extra dough for. For those who didn't get the original DVD it's definitely worth getting, but it might not be worth putting out the extra cash if you have it already. Now if they included the earlier videos from 81-85 (gotta love Just Can't Get Enough...and the pre-Alan Wilder days!), then it might be a worthwhile package...."
4,There were videos missing.,"In general, I enjoyed this DVD, although my main problem with it was that the videos I was expecting to see in this collection were not on this collection. Where's ""Shake the Disease,"" the original ""Strangelove,"" ""Halo,"" ""Clean,"" ""It's Called A Heart,"" and most importantly, ""People Are People?"" I can go on and on about this...Like I said from the beginning, good DVD, but the person who compiled it left a lot of the good ones out."
4,Depeche Mode-Videos 86>98,I rather enjoyed having all those DM videos in one easy DVD set. It's nice.
4,Depeche Mode Style media,"This was an incredible collection of promotional media. Very rare interview promotional clips where the shinning moments of this DVD I honestly can not remember any Depeche Mode videos (VHS) or DVD containing this much interview footage (which is the short film listings) outside of Depeche Mode 101.The best interview was indeed the Gambaccini/Anton interview for the ""Songs of Faith and Devotion"" album with the surprising interruption from the ""Mystery Women"". The video collection was interestingly missing a few videos but the videos that is featured was converted to digital nicely and the quality was stellar. This is a great collection but don't expect everything counting when looking for every little bit film concerning the music media.This would have received 4.5 stars (if possible)."
4,Great compilation of DM music & video,"If you're a true DM fan as I am, this is a treasure and must-have. The quick commentaries and background on the videos are quite comical and sheds light on what a great group DM is. It's no surprise how they've lasted for almost 20 years. Although the picture quality isn't that great, DVD itself is awesome. Good enough to leave on and listen to even if you're not watching."
3,dissapointing sound quality,"i have recently bought depeche mode 86-98 the videos. as a dm fan i was very dissapointed from the sound quality in this dvd, the sound is very restrained it lacks calrity the 16kh is barely noticed. if u compare the cd's to the dvd you will be very dissapointed.shame on u dm for letting this dvd represent u!"
2,oh no!,"Bought this one at a risk...hoped for something good, but only a few songs on here to excite me....like personal jesus track, other than that nothing great...maybe im getting to old for this kinda music... but this is not quite up my street....even my girlfriend agreed with me... so i cannot be that wrong and i wouldnt like to argue with her!"
2,Esperaba mas de este DVD,"Compré muy emocionado el DVD porque esperaba recibir algo igual o por encima de los CDs a los que nos tiene acostumbrados Depeche Mode. La imagen es granulado, y la calidad del sonido es menor a la del Cd. Solo por el hecho de traer imagenes y un comentario es que se salva. Jalón de orejas para DM, y espero que se rectifiquen."
5,Must Have!,"This is a definite must have for all you Depeche Mode fans that are out there. This DVD is a collection of the band's videos for some of their greatest songs from 86 to 98. It is a real pleasure watching this DVD and seeing DM throughout the years. Not only are the videos great, but you also get to see Depeche Mode talk in short interviews at the beginning and at the end. At the end of the video presentations there is a short Depeche Mode film in which is defintely a treat for any DM fan. The short film is basically a series of interviews with the band members and people that have worked with the band. The band members talk about their career as a group and the making of each album and video for the 86-98 time period. It is a great way to see each band member idividually talk and there is also a special apperance by former band member Alan Wilder (1982-1995). Alan Wilder also talks about the band's history and their work. A great DVD to have by one of the best bands of all time."
4,"Good collection but I wish it was 81-98,","As far as I know, there's not a video collection to go along with the 81-85 CD. For the reviewer who was complaining about the ""quality"" of the early videos, those are all from the Music for the Masses era, and were filmed in grainy black and white on purpose (I assume). That's what the videos look like. That's what they looked like in 1987. All in all, though, great collection of DM's videos. Especially the ones that weren't released in the states like Home and Little 15."
4,Nice balance of their videos.,"It is a nice balance of their videos. However many are in black and white, perhaps this was done to save money in production."
4,"If you like DM, you will love this DVD!","Remember when MTV used to play videos? If you do and you are a Depeche Mode fan, then you are in luck. The nice people at Warner Brothers put together every video the band made from 1986 to 1998. However, don't expect to use the Dolby digital feature of that new receiver, the whole DVD is in PCM. Although the sound is good, it is not great. Anyway, for an enjoyable trip down memory lane, pick up the DVD."
1,I havent expected such a crap,"Sorry, I am also fan of DM, indeed. But I do no appretiate poor quality of sound. I definitely would not suggest to buy this dvdif you want to have quality. But if you want to have videoclips go ahead and buy. I really was disappointed with quality of sound its like watching mtv."
3,"Good Collection of Songs, But Disappointing Fidelity...","Although I'm a big Depeche Mode fan going back to their early years (and attended almost all of their NY area concerts during their heyday), this DVD left me wanting. The sound quality just wasn't there, as the sound tracks used PCM (standard CD quality pulse code modulation). It would have been great to have the soundtrack remastered for surround using Dolby Digital 5.1 or even better DTS 5.1. So little effort was made to make this a ""real"" DVD in terms of surround information. On the positive side the video/song selection is great, so its still worth buying if you are a fan."
3,Something is missing,"Ok, everybody compares this movie to the Godfather... but you shouldn't.This movie is nice but cannot be compared to the masterpiece ""The Godfather"". Why? Simply the Godfather covers the personal life of the gang, wives & children... love and hate... struggle and dreams. But the Untouchables never comes near this side of De Niro...It's one of the best movies for Kevin Costner. But certainly not the best of De Niro or Sean Connery.Besides such DVD deserves additional features... but there isn't any in this edition."
3,4 star story minus a star for two reasons,"This is a fantasic story, and of course it is since David Mamet is responsible for it. But what is up with the incredibly cheesy music?! And not only is it just plain bad, but it is constantly qued at the wrong times, yuck. Not only that but Kevin Costner, enough said on that.Besides all that, Sean Connery is great and the story is great, directing is ok. So, 4 star movie made 3 by the music and Costner, what were they thinking?DVD itself is also good, the picture and sound are solid."
1,FRANK NITTI'S FAMILY SHOULD SUE,"among all the five star reviews, it's funny nobody mentioned the blatantmisrepresentation of frank nitti in this movie.he was not a rat-faced psychopath who was thrown off a building by elliot ness as portrayed in this movie. mr. nitti was second in command, and after capone was incarcerated, nitti ran the mob for 13 years.his life ended when he allegedly committed suicide in 1943.i don't mind movies blurring the facts in the name of dramatic license,but in this case being completely blind to actual events will earn this film only one star from me.btw, de palma also ruined ""the black dahlia.""please mr. de palma, don't make anymore movies."
4,Terrific Movie and a Decent Transfer,"Since this is an ""older"" movie, I won't bother with reviewing the film itself, except to say that it still is one of the most entertaining and satisfying experiences you'll have at the movies.As for the Blu-ray transfer, it's decent. The set detail and the colors really pop, particularly in scenes at the Lexington Hotel with Capone and his mob. In fact, the detail is so good as to become distracting at times -- you may find yourself marveling at the quality of the picture and forgeting about the story being told. A minor digital skip at one point may have been a disk flaw rather than a transfer flaw.Sound quality is excellent. The opening scene explosion rocks. And Ennio Morricone's magnificent score has never sounded better. Listen through the end credits as this terrific music envelopes you.While certainly not a reference-quality disk, the transfer is good and will make you appreciate the investment you made in a hi-def TV and player."
5,Awesome,"Unbelievable acting by Connery, De Niro and Garcia and surprisingly, Costner. The plot flows without missing a beat. De Niro is so good playing the bad guy, you would wanna smash him with a baseball bat yourself."
4,Great Movie...,"Great movie... I'm not sure if the Blu-ray edition is quite different from the DVD, but it's nice."
4,One of the best mob movies ever,"While it's a mob movie, it's really about Elliot Ness and his band of ""untouchables"". The script is excellent and the acting is superb. The recreation of the time period is exquisite and the cinematography is awesome. The railway station scene is one of the best suspenseful scenes in any movie, period. Sean Connery rightfully won the supporting actor Oscar for his part. Assuming you like suspense, action and great acting, you can't go wrong with this movie."
2,"to improve saling online the language information must be clear, since I bought it in spanish. However the spanish for latin","to improve saling online the language information must be clear, since I bought it in spanish. However the spanish for latin america must be specificed because the dubbed language is Spanish from is Spain which is totally differeren. The Spanish from Spain does not sound good for Latin America"
3,Not a good as I remember...,"I remembered this movie fondly so decided to watch it again. Unfortunately, I think it's a bit dated now and not a good as I remember."
5,No Review Necessary.,"Really, if you have seen this movie, then you know what I am talking about when I say no review necessary. If you have not seen this, I hate to ask what rock you've been hiding under. Do yourself a favor and get this movie."
4,A Regular Action Flick,"I came into this movie expecting a look at the crime scene akin to Goodfellas or Casino, though from a cop's perspective. Instead, the Untouchables is more along the lines of Dirty Harry, serving up a similar attitude of doling out justice even if it be against the law.That doesn't automatically make it a bad movie, of course, but even this point is only briefly developed toward the end. The rest is filled with uninspired direction, very vivid settings, well-done cinematography (the shoot-outs especially), and plenty of pulp. This movie really deserves a 3.5, as I always favor substance over style, and it is hard to find any great weight to this thriller (which Goodfellas managed to acquire quite aptly).It does well as a movie watched on a random evening with some friends, but shouldn't be burdened with undue expectations. Perhaps Once Upon A Time In America will manage to scratch that itch."
3,"DeNiro Great, Costner Terrible!","Kevin Costner continues to mumble his way through another film. A superlative supporting cast and great cinematography. DeNiro as great as ever. Costner is Mr. No Emotion. I watched most of the episodes of this on TV and was always glued to the set. Kevin Costner brings new meaning to the word listless. Robert Stack was quintessential as Ness. Never knew if he was married, single, divorced, widowed or even celibate. But Stack was the man in charge and you knew it. Costner seems to rule by committee. Dangerous to do this. Yes he is incorruptible, yes he is plodding in his methodology. He is actually just plain plodding in everything. Had a local arts editor once who loved Costner, made her toes squirm. She didn't understand the first thing about theater but loved him anyway. The movie would be great if Costner had been replaced as Ness. With him in it is just ho hum."
3,"The movie is terrific, the DVD is abysmal","This is probably one of the greatest gangster movies of all time, and the fact that it is based on a true story makes it all the more compelling. The acting was first-rate, the cinematography exquisite, and the music fit the setting very well. For the few reading this review that do not already know the plot, it is the story of how Elliot Ness's band of ""untouchable"" agents brought down Al Capone. The band was formed because prohibition-era law enforcement was so corrupt, Ness could not trust anyone, not even the police or his fellow treasury agents. The film is fab, there's nothing wrong with it. The problem is the DVD. I don't see why anyone would bother to release a modern classic on DVD with no extras whatsoever. No behind-the-scenes footage, no deleted scenes, no interviews, no historical documentaries, nothing. The picture and sound quality are excellent, but you don't get very much bang for your buck with this DVD."
3,the war on drugs of another time,"Organized crime has Chicago bought and paid for under Al Capone.Police officers and judges dance to the tune of bootleg booze.This was real life in the prohibition era where the federal lawagainst alcohol made the Mafia smugglers and brewers kings.A federal task force was set up under Eliot Nessand he was a tough as the criminals he fought.This movie is actually a remake of a TV series from the late 50's early 60's with Robert Stack:The Untouchables - Season 1, Vol. 1.Like the westerns about OK Corral, what was historical facthas tended to run into Hollywwod's glorifications.The acting here is pretty good and all the period cars are very fine,but one finds himself doubting the scenes and costumes after seeing a numberof films actually done at that time in black and white.The baby buggy scene is really fantastic, in which twotreasury agents take on a whole gang of thugs and win."
4,The Untouchables,This is a great movie with great actors. The only thing in my opinion that they could have done better was the hotel scene. Where Ness encountered Capone in the hotel. I think it was looked pretty fake. But the rest of the movie was great!
5,Sean Connery makes the movie,Connery gives some memorable moments counseling the younger Ness on effective law enforcement. The interogation scene is something else. The accountant closing in on tax evasion is a nod toward history.
5,The Untouchables,"This is a great movie that I was very happy to see. Sean Connery does an excellent job in the film as a mentor to Costner. The ups and downs in the film make it all the more exciting with the ""Untouchables"" going after the ruthless bootleggers. With a great story, and great acting, I recommend this film."
5,Blu ray worth the upgrade,"I was really impressed with the blu ray transfer of this movie. Sometimes with older movies you have to do a side by side comparison to realize the improvement, but for The Untouchables it was clear to me right away that it was an upgrade. The movie looks so good that it's easy to forget that it is 23 years old. This movie was also shot in a way where the blu ray treatment really helps e.g. a lot of closeups of faces and a nice use of color (I compared the scene outside the hotel when the bellboy picks the papers off the red carpet and was pretty amazed at how much ""redder"" the red was on blu ray).The sound seemed like it was improved, but I am not enough of a sound expert to know for sure. There are also some extras on here, but I don't know if it's anything that's groundbreaking."
2,Where's the Beef?,"What kind of incompetent nutbag puts out a classic like this on DVD without 1 single extra feature. Come on.. Where's the bonus material? Where's the Commentary, Deleted Scenes, etc? It's not like Kevin Costner is too busy doing other movies! There should be a law against putting out DVD's that only contain the movie without extra stuff. It's not only a waste of valuable space, it's very nearly a ripoff. Thank you, goodnight."
5,"Great then, and even better now on Blu-ray","With the passage of time, regard for THE UNTOUCHABLES continues to rise. What can I say that hasn't been said by every critic about this movie? It's a classic, and beautifully filmed. Blu-ray makes it even better."
5,"Great film , but not great DVD","The film is great , but very is the extras ?Only trailer is available. :(I hope the SE will be some day , but for now this is the onlyversion available - so have it !As for me , I would have given Oscar to Andy Garcia instead ofSean Connery - George Stone is awesome !"
3,"Good, but not great","The acting was fair and Sean Connery deserved the oscar he got for his part, but one could easily tell that it is violently innacurate, I am not very affiliated with this time period, but I can tell 95% is pure hollywood imagination."
3,The sound quality is not good enough for a Blu Ray,"I note that quite a lot on the blu ray movies sold at Amazon don't have uncompressed sound feature, that is there is no DTS-HD and Dolby-TrueHD. Thus the play back does not live up to expectation."
2,Costner plays his role like a cartoon,"great acting?...WTF?!Kevin Costner plays his character like a F'n cartoon character. Mostly all the characters in this movie seem like 1 dimentional charicatures of their real-life personas. Take Elliot Ness for example, he constantly spits out corny one-liners (""lets do some good""...hahaha who wrote that script?!), he barely has any emotion to show, which forces to be annoyed & hate Ness & cheer for the bad guy (Deniro as the cartoon version of Capone). The whole movie i just wished Capone would just run up to Ness & beat him senseless with a baseball bat..dont get me started on the comedian that played Malone. hahahahaha, this movie is bad. aside from Deniro's comeback in the 80s...this movie would've recieved a negative 10 stars. nuff said"
3,What is with this?,"I never understood the whole homophobia thing, but I guess you get it with this movie. Okay Okay peoples, maybe perhaps it really is about some guys who are invincible but that movie already came out and that bartender that played for the Eagles, well that is a football team and they touch a lot. In fact that game, they dive and give flying bear hugs to each other. Kevin Costner is here and you know, he tried making it some emo-sap ridden baseball movie but the guys with the machine guns were not having it!When MC Hammer jumped on stage and said ""can't touch this"" I just turned it off. I said to my friend ""friend, why did you rent this, next time I am going with you to the store"" and that was the end of our movie night"
3,Wrong cover,"The Blu ray is great but amazon, again, is misleading with the photo profile, one of the main reasons i bought this Blu ray is because of the beautiful cover photo showed on the profile, but WRONG, they sent the Blu ray with the ugly cover, so this time i will have a bad review for amazon, sorry, but this time you defrauded me."
3,Too Hollywood,"I didn't like this movie. I think that it was a good idea for a movie but it was very ""hollywood"". Big names, effects but no sustance in the story."
2,Where's the greatness everybody sees?,"I AM a die hard fan of Brian DePalma and Kevin Costner: I DO like Waterworld and The Postman, and I think that he (Costner) is great in this movie, but, am I the only one who can see how absurd the story and the dialogues are? Didn't anybody else see that the guy that's killed by Ness in the little cabin (Canadian border scene) fell the other side from where Sean Connery picked him up? This is not just a light comment, I wanted to like this movie so much that I watched it like three times, but this is just too much"
2,Bad quality and they are not made in germay!,"I bought 4 sets and returned them because the bad quality and not made in germany. However, they are not expensive, maybe I expect too much."
1,Didn't work,We bought this in January for my daughters science fair. The girls worked with their science teacher. They never could get it to work. It was a waste of money.
3,Crystal Radio,"I bought this for my 8 year old as a Cub Scout project. While it's pretty simple and straight forward, the spring connectors are pretty touchy for a child's fingers (for an adults fingers, too).So far, all we have is hum (hummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm), but we're going to a)try for a better ground, and b)take the radio physically closer to an AM station. The good news is that all he needs to do is build it to satisfy the Cub Scout requirements. Check!I know it should work, so we're going to persevere."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this for my cub scout den. The boys had a great time putting it together and learning. However, it didn't work. We tried our best to tune into Tokyo with no luck."
5,Great Gift for Families,This is a great gift for yourself or someone else. we use it almost everynight at dinner. Just when you thought you knew your kin...take one of these cards out and ask the question....you may be surprised at the answers you will here.
4,Great Questions - just wish that there were more!,"I am very happy with TableTopics Family - the questions are as high quality as I had hoped, and our family is enjoying it. The level of discourse at our dinner table is certainly elevated! I just wish there were ... more ... it does feel expensive for the amount of questions. Still, highly recommended !!!"
4,A Good Starting Point,"We often useFamily Time Fun Dinner Games and Activitiesto keep our 10 year old and 5 year old engaged at dinner (and the games often carry over to car rides, etc.). I thought this would be a fun addition and give us some more starting points for talking topics. We usually don't have a lot of trouble getting conversations going but my 10 year old seems to talk less and less as he gets older...But, he loves to read these cards and start. Many of the topic starters are too advanced for my 5 year old and some of them are silly but there are plenty to chose from.They come in a very sturdy plastic case that protects the cards nicely.These might be fun for family a get-together or cocktail hour with good friends.Most people with some understanding of the art of conversation probably won't need these cards but they can certainly open up some fun discussions that you may never think of starting."
5,gift for parents,my parents had never seen this before and were thrilled to have this over the holidays with all the family together. Lots of fun and entertainment value to hear what other people answer to some of these questions.
4,Good family talks,The game is a good for stimulating conversation on different topics with your kids. It's geared more for kids over the age of 10. We pick a card every night after dinner and discuss it.
5,Not just for conversation!,"This is a great product for starting discussions, while at the dinner table or elsewhere. It makes kids think about things they may not normally think about and gives parents a peek into their child's brain. It is interesting to hear some of the responses my son comes up with. It is also a convenient way to give your child a topic to write about for an essay or in a journal. If they write about it, you can hold onto it and look back years from now and get a good laugh or cry. A little bit expensive, but the plastic case is extremely sturdy and makes it look nice if you keep it at the dining table. Also a good conversation starter with your spouse or an small friendly gathering. A simple idea with a lot of uses!"
5,"table top conversation cards,family addition",This can really get everyone talking and exploring your thoughts on different subjects. It makes you stop and think about how you really view things. It even surprises you to know how others feel about certain things. You can even have a good time just laughing at what everyone else has to say.
3,good intentions,"We have 4 kids: 10, 8, 6, and 2 yrs. old. We got this product to change the focus of dinnertime from ""eat your veggies,"" to something more fun, positive, and meaningful. If you're didicated, it could work. The idea is great, but there may be other similar products that are less expensive and just as effective. The kids have taken turns pulling a card out and reading it to introduce a new topic and that's kind of fun for them, too."
5,WOnderful for family meals,We debuted table topics with our preteen daughters and their grandparents. What would have normally been a 20 minute meal with everyone quickly scattering back to their ipads or the tv turned into a wonderful 2 hour meal where we all had a chance to answer the questions. The best part was my children got to hear from their grandparents point of view and my parents got to hear from their grandchildren's point of view. It was a wonderful tool to bridge generations and spark funny or really thought provoking responses.
4,Great fun even with teens,Pros: fun and interesting questions that really got great conversations going with my teens. There were a variety of questions that were humorous and thought provoking. Our family really enjoyed it.Cons: I gave it four stars because I thought if was a bit pricey for a box of questions. Sturdy cards though. If one is creative they can make their own set.
4,Expensive for what it is,"This product, cards with questions on each one inside a square plastic box, is way to expensive ($25). Then again, I bought it, didn't I?!?! Our family enjoys the questions...all have been appropriate for family discussion."
5,It really works!,"My two teenage sons are growing up to be wonderful men, but our dinner conversations have degraded over the last several years. Take a small amount of teenage angst mixed with schoolyard humor, testosterone and a couple of irreverent senses of humor and you can paint the picture of what the conversations were like. Half the time they had me laughing so much I couldn't eat, and the rest of the time I was holding my head in my hands in frustration. I didn't want to be overbearing, and I do enjoy their senses of humor, but it was getting where we never had a decent conversation and I was desperate to find something to change the situation.I bought this product as an experiment and was amazed at the results. Even the most reluctant of the two teenagers came around and was engaged in the conversation. We talked about things that would never have come up in our normal conversations and I learned some things about my kids I never knew."
3,I was disappointed,"I was disappointed in the topics of the cards. I hesitate to write this review because apparently many people loved this product. I guess I was hoping for topics that we already didn't discuss and that would open dialog more. It is great that you can randomly just pick a card and talk about it though so it isn't a total waste. I think if it were a little cheaper I would be happier as I would feel that it was worth the price even if we only used it occasionally.A great way to use this is in the car on long drives. The kids can pick the card and read the topic. Far better than video games, in my opinion. But we don't like to use it just sitting a the table at dinner."
3,questions are somewhat lame,"I purchased this for my neice after I received the ""adult"" version and thought she would enjoy the game with her family. While the questions in the adult game are provocative (not in a negative way), the ones in this ""family"" version are rather lame, kind of boring!"
4,Abrupt ending,Love the book!! Love the whole series. Each book gets better and better! Although my favourite is the three musketeers.
1,demora na entrega,"Item no foi entregue na data programada. Estava em viagem e no pude levar o produto, haja vista a demora."
2,Half of the product missing,"This purchase was a dissappointment. I bought this for my brother for Christmas. When he opened it, the bottle was half empty. I felt really bad about it. I dont know how this could happen, but its a shame."
5,Christmas gift,Ralph Lauren Polo For Men Eau de Toilette SprayI purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my son. He was delighted with it.
5,polo,You sent the wrong bottle. I distinctly ordered the pour bottle. and that is what you have displayed as my order. You did NOT send the pour bottle. You sent the spray bottle. I do not want the spray bottle. I want the pour bottle. I will not be buying any more cologne from you unless you make it right.
1,Wrong product,"As displayed on the web site, it supposed to be the perfume. However, I'm very disappointed and it's very bad experience I ever had with amazon.com. BECAREFUL! This is not the perfume, it's deoderant. This product is also not eligible for returning. Now I get 3 deoderant sticks enough for 3 years, instead of the perfume I wished for. SUCKS!"
2,Not The Polo I Remember,"Despite a great deal on the 4oz size vs. the 2oz size, this Polo doesn't smell like the Polo (standard, green bottle, original) I am used to. Smells like Brut cologne. Soapy. Disappointed. Stick with the 2oz sizes and best to smell before you buy (at the store) perhaps? That being said, the Bleu De Chanel samples are awesome and highly recommended!"
1,very disappointed in this product,"I recently ordered this product from Brazil. The price was attractive since this product, Polo perfume, sells for a bit more here in Brazilian stores. But the scent of the perfume was very weak. Shortly after applying it, the scent had nearly disappeared. The Polo I'm familiar with has a scent that will last the whole day. Was the product tampered with? Was the Polo perfume replaced with a poorer quality product? I don't know, but I'm suspicious.Douglas Ota"
5,"if you like polo, buy it here","this isnt a review of how polo smells. most people dont buy a cologne or perfume online without ever smelling it so im assuming you already like the scent if youre here. my 5 stars are because this product is 15-20 bucks more expensive for the exact same bottle if you buy it at the big dept store that throws the parade in nyc. its much cheaper here and if you already like it, you may as well save the money and buy it online and get free shipping too."
1,Defective Products,I purchased a bottle of Polo from Amazon that was shipped from the seller fromemeraldgreen1966. The first bottle has a defective sprayer. They replaced it with a new bottle that also had a defective sprayer. I believe this company is selling defective products as new and would never buy from them again.
2,Different from what i remember....,"I was really excited about getting this, it's a scent i remember with fondness from my earlier years and i was delighted to see that i could still get my hands on it. I got a shock when it arrived though.. it didn't smell anything like it i remembered, maybe it's just me but it had this weird smell to it like there was something else mixed in. can't stand the smell now and i think i""d be doing my fragrance purchases direct from the store where i cansmell it first.."
2,Unhappy Consumer,"I ordered from Amazon's vendor Polo 'Pour"" EDT. One week later I receive 'Spray"" EDT. I called vendor twice and both times the response was sorry bout that and that was it!!!So I guess next time I order the jaguar and they ship the Yugo it'll be okay!! Never again will I ever ever ever order from this vendor. I have used Polo 'pour"" for 28 years and will continue to. I will definitely not purchase from Amazon or one of their vendors.Amazing how the negative vendor review I wrote disappeared as well!!!!"
3,Nice but..,"It is a little strong initially, maybe even overpowering at first, but then it mellows, and has a nice forest/woods feel, not citrusy, that is nice. However, when I go to the fragrance counter at stores and sample a ton of fragrances, I have to admit that I don't really find Ralph Lauren fragrances appeal to me personally.I got this as a gift, and probably would not have bought this one myself. Its lasts a long time, and can seem pleasant enough. Its 'ok', not something I'd heartily recommend."
5,Good book for beginners,I found this book to be very useful to me as a beginner when it comes to meditation. It is written in language that I can understand. The references to horseback riding where helpful even though I don't personally ride horses (my wife does). I have read all but the last two chapters so far.
4,Where's the answer key?,"Good book with lots of exercises to practice with but there is no answer key with which to check oneself. Overall, I'm pleased with the book though."
2,very disappointing.,"this is a course book not a reference grammar. the layout is unattractive and the ordering extremely strange (Supposedly in the order that brazilian children learn - what does that have to do with foreign language students?). it has been reprinted 12 times, obviously without revision - except the price, of course! grammatical explanations are sometimes poor or unclear and exercises etc are lumped in with the grammar."
4,How it's really spoken,"This is a very helpful book for anyone who works with Brazilians or is dating a Brazilian. This is Brazilian Portuguese as it is spoken, not the formal classroom stuff. In combination with a decent vocabulary cassette, for example, Vocabulearn's English/Portuguese, you will get a good start."
3,With Reservation,"If you are a beginner, this is not the workbook for you. I have been studying for a few years and knew most of the erly vocabulary and simple grammar. My purpose was to clarify certain technical grammar/usage issues so it will serve my needs. However, with no answer key, it is frustrating in completing and reviewing the exercises. If this is used as a workbook in conjuction with a course directed by a teacher, then exercise answers may be corrected in class."
2,too long and to hard for me,"i am sure it is a great DVD...but for women who are expecting a baby and not really working..... 90 minutes it is a lot...i thought it would be 90 min , but with different parts... to be able to do whatever you have time to do ... choose a part... and come back without starting from the beginning... i couldn't do the all thing.... and i feel i always have to start from the beginning again.... i don't think it is good to skip the beginning and start from where i stopped the last time.All the women on DVD are VERY pregnant , and all really comfortable with each exercises... it is amazing!!!Also i am a beginner, and it is ok to follow the exercises... pretty much...but better to know about yoga ...i also bought the DVD, The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1 from Karyne Steben for workout and loved it... short , different levels... i could almost do it everyday... better for me."
4,Dynamic Prenatal Yoga,"When I bought this Prenatl Yoga DVD I was not sure what I was getting, but I have to say that I do like it very much. It's not easy and some positions are very challanging but if you do the class few times, you get used to it."
3,Annoying...but good workout,"I have done yoga for over 10 years, and have to say that this was the most annoying CD I have ever done. Christine was mono-tone, boring, and like another reviewer said, put in her sales pitch for chiropractic medicine which I found tasteless. The music makes you want to fall asleep. The only think that keeps you awake are the poses. She does a decent job with the yoga...but again, their is no fluidity."
5,I love this workout!!,"I bought this dvd when I was a couple of months pregnant with great intentions of having a super fit pregnancy. I put it on the long finger however until I was 7 months pregnant and I'm so sorry I didn't start sooner! I've never done yoga before but I found this dvd very easy to follow. Even though I couldn't do all the poses, just the deep breathing really relaxed me and it gave me some 'me' time. Dr. Anderson's voice is very soothing and really instils confidence for a calm easy birth. Because of this dvd I'll definately take up yoga classes once baby is born."
2,Not for me,I didn't like this because I thought it was too difficult for a pregnant woman and it didn't have different levels of difficulty.
2,"Decent but long workout, disconcerting imagery","If you have 1.5 hours to get through the entire dvd it is helpful, but the background folk Christian and punk art-deco style (?) imagery (e.g., headless naked blue mannequin wrapped in outdoor lights standing behind the instructor) is out-of-place, as is the image of the instructor herself. I also found it hard to relax looking at the harsh contrasting lime green, black, and blue colors in the instructor's studio/living room. Finally, Dr. Anderson is a chiropractor not a medical doctor so don't let the title fool you into thinking she brings medical knowledge to this -- in fact, she advises everyone use a chiropractor during pregnancy -- something I've never heard or read anywhere else!"
4,I love this DVD,I've tried Shiva Reas's Prenatal Yoga DVD and thought it was way too slow and easy (even though I'm not even that advanced or fit) so when I did Dr. Christine's Dynamic Prenatal Yoga DVD I was extremely pleased and relieved to find something both enjoyable and that made me feel like I got some decent exercise. I'm in the middle of my second trimester and will definately keep using this DVD for the next 4 months and probably even after the birth.
5,Only Second to a Class with Dr. Christine,I was lucky enough to have class with Christine before I moved away and couldn't fine another class like hers. She really focuses staying strong and keeping endurance you will need throughout pregnancy and childbirth. She also gives you the chance to do the exercises according to your ability. The video is 90min and you are able to pick and choose segments as well if you don't want to do the whole DVD and mix it up a bit.
1,don't buy it,"I bought this product after reading good reviews. What a waste of money. It is the worst kind of quality you can imagine. Real home movie stuff and although the yoga moves are good, the instructor is so right on that it just puts you off. Save your money and go for a walk!"
4,Take a journey through near mystical places in our land.,"I have this in VHS, so it was time to up grade. I wish it had a sharper picture,(16mm film) but the music matched with breath-taking landscapes combines to make a very enjoyable video adventure."
2,Good concept crippled by weak source material.,"The graininess of the 16mm film detracts from the smooth, soothing atmosphere attempted by the producers. With high resolution viewing, the imperfections and age of the orginal equipment are substantially irritating. Cheaply priced, but I wished I had saved for 50% of Starship Troopers. I received good reviews on Earthlight, and will try that...a reluctant thumbs down on Desert Vision."
3,decent,"that one guy is right. this is like early 90's sounding stuff... i feel love is the best song. there are a few others though... thunderdome is real annoying and this cd has alot of annoying samples,,, but some stuff is good. very cool CD cover though! this is defenently not as amazing as people say, but its decent."
3,gold hoop earrings a little disappointing--too small,"They are a bit too small and have silver on the outside edge, which I did not want. Not visible in photo."
3,Painful!,"These are attractive gold earrings that appear to be high quality, although a little bit thinner than they appear online. My big problem, though, was the post that goes through the earlobe-- not only was it very thick (much thicker than the posts of my other earrings) but there was a rounded ball at the tip which really hurt when I pushed it through my ear. Maybe it's that I'm used to wearing smaller, thinner earrings, but I will have to return these and look for something that doesn't hurt to wear."
3,14k yellow gold satin earrings,"The earrings are small and lightweight, which is what I wanted, but was mislead by the review that said the catches were tight..........they are not. The catch opens and the earrings fall out."
4,Wooden Walls of England,"HMS Trincomalee is definitely not one of Nelson's frigates but she certainly could played the part. Although built in India and launched couple of years after Napoleon's fall at Waterloo, this ship represent what a frigate would look like during the days of Wooden Ships and Iron Men. She had an active career once restored to duty in the 1840s, 50s and 60s before being retired again. The author make it clear that this ship proves to be so well built that it simply defied the passage of time. The book proves to be well written, well illustrated and well researched on the history and restoration of this vessel. Originally a Leda class 36 gun fifth rate, the ship went through numerous changes during her history and it is a credit to the people who restored her to her original state.The book come highly recommended for anyone interested about the fighting ships of the old wooden navy (nationalities probably don't matter here)."
5,Earth Angels,"I have read this book and it was such a blessing to me! I needed to know I'm not alone in this world and this book inspired, comforted, and made me feel special all wrapped up in one. I know that God watches over us and that we have guardian angels, but this book was a reminder in this time of need. I hope everyone that reads it will pray for God to open thier heart to be an earth angel for someone else in need. I certainly will be!"
5,Even if you can't play it's fun to watch,"I bought this video because I wanted to learn some simple melodies and just have fun with my recently purchased ukulele. At first I was discouraged by the video's fast pace but after taking everything step by step I'm slowly progressing through the lessons on the tape. This video may be a little intimidating to complete novices such as myself, but if you have patience and you are willing to practice this video will definitely teach you the sounds that you're looking for. I would also like to say that the solo performed at the end of the tape by Ledward Kaapana is absolutely amazing! I would definitely recommend this video as an instructional tool and a private concert."
1,"URC, fix your customer support nightmare","Where do I begin? I really want to love this product, but URC does everything it can to make consumers that want this a nightmare.- If you do not buy from an authorized dealer, no software for you. Are you kidding me? Its editor software, and I need the remote to use your software. URC is trying going to stay in the arena of custom home theater installers only unless they fix this bad policy.- Serial adapter?? URC, 1995 says hi, but welcome to 2010 with USB. Heck we have USB 3.0 now. I had to buy three different cables, go through multiple Windows operating systems, etc just to even get the adapter to work. Wow, talk about a nightmare.All things considered, I spent a bunch of money and I feel like I got taken to the cleaners.Let me be clear: I will never buy a URC product ever again unless they fix the two issues above. Logitech, you have my business from now on."
2,No customer support available from Universal Remote,"While the product seems sound, if you have a problem forget getting any help from the manufacturer. They will just tell you it is not in production and won't provide any help. They send you to where you bought it in the first place and often, they don't provide any actual technical support.If you want a decent product with support, don't buy this because you will be left on your own once you have it.Do some research and try calling the manufacturer of what ever device you are considering to be sure you can actually get customer support.Universal Remote, the maker of this has very long wait times then once they stop making a product they will no longer support yours either."
4,Another tech toy to,"love after it's programmed.I am a technically challenged lady who still enjoys all the toys available. I just need set up and programming help as well as user lessons. Then, I am fine.The mx-850 is great for end users like me. Easy to learn how to use it, really is the one and only remote needed for all your equipment and is ergonomically comfortable.My rating takes into consideration the programming difficulty and the short life of the batteries.It gets a strong recommendation from me as well as the suggestion to research before you buy."
2,No help from the maker !,"Nice and versatile remote. But don't count on any technical support. The maker of this control says it is not in production and refuses to offer support any more.Personally I believe that if you pay this much for a remote, tech support should always be available at lest for those who already purchased it. I called them today and was outright refused help and told to go back to where I bought it.That is a good example of what has gone wrong with American companies and their customer service attitudes."
4,"Great hardware, but the software could be better","Probably the best universal remote control available. It is just the best piece of hardware around. The software however could be better : it lacks a feature to alow users to key in IR codes (there are work-arounds, but they require using a series of third-party software). I doubt it would take much effort to add this feature to the software (it seems it existed in some previous version, but it was later disabled). Also, the manufacturer does not seem to keep its IR code database up to date with the latest devices."
2,Hardware Is Not So Good Either,"In addition to having to pay a 'professional' to re-program it if you make a change to your entertainment system, be prepared to pay to have it repaired if it should happen to fall off of your coffee table. Inside the head of this unit is a radio transmitter circuit board and antenna. It is secured only by a piece foam rubber and eight very tiny solder joints. If your remote falls even a few feet and hits just right, the weight of the circuit board will break the tiny solder joints. You'll have to try to find someone who is willing to fix it and then pay them $40 - $100 to have it repaired. It is clearly a bad design."
1,mx 850 piece of junk,"i am a professional installer and had occassion to retrofit some equipment for a client. he had an URC mx 850 universal remote control that had been programmed by the professional he had purchased it from... and it never worked. so i called URC and after 25 phone calls and begging and pleading they sent me the editor software that, while functional is pretty vague and badly set up. their "" largest IR database in the world"" is outdated by years and there is no home theatre equipment listed at all. "" just learn it "" they say. so... you either have an IT degree and about 30 hours to do this or you pay some guy THEY trained 500 bucks to do it... until you get another piece of equipment... then you do it again. anyone that buys these things thinking it's making life easier is crazy. and they ain't cheap either. don't waste your money"
1,MX-850 Still not operational?,"I have downloaded and uploaded all the software for my MX-850 and it still doesn't work. I haved pushed the (Main) and (Enter) button to try to get the Learn mode and select my Mitsubishi WD-57731 TV. But when I go through all the function buttons on my TV remote to get the MX-850 to learn it, nothing works??? Am I doing something wrong or do I really to need a professional to set my MX-850?I like the great price that I got, but they didn't tell me about the additional cost of the $300 plus to have it set up by a professional Home Theater specialist. Now I realize why the MX-850 got such a poor review. I would really like to find out how he was able to set up his MX-850 so easily to give it such a great review?Other wise I may have to send it back."
3,Not for the Electronically Challenged,"The remote does not ship with programming instructions. The pamphlet that ships with it advises you to hire a professional programmer. In San Diego, you can hire the nerds at GeekSquad down at Best Buy to do the programming."
2,Be prepared to lose the volume control,"I have had this product for 3 years and now the volume control is gone. On top of the programming being a trial, don't the engineers know that the volume control is the most used button on the control? Apparently not. Now I have to use the tuner remote becuz I hate the idea of spending $400 just to increase the volume."
1,Don't go near this one unless you are a dealer,"I tried to replace my worn-out MX650, but found it was no longer available. I bought the MX850 and quickly found out that the unit was only programmable by computer link - they even took out any possibility of doing it manually like the MX650. In a bizarre Catch 22, the company no longer provides the software that is needed to program it. Apparently only professional retailers are allowed to use the software. I gamely searched the web, read blogs, and actually downloaded an approximation to the correct software, but couldn't get it to work. I gave up and returned the unit. I'd strongly recommend against anyone buying this product who isn't in the business."
5,Great control solution!!,"Great unit! I've had this one since it was first released as the ""Orion""! Programs well, even with the crippled software from URC's website.Negative reviewers just don't have a clue. Get the software, program it and if you don't have the codes because of lack of update, learn them into the remote.Macros are the way to go, if you don't setup macros, you're just going to fumble with the remote and it would be the same as having all the other remotes instead of this one. Oh, and since there isn't a .pdf manual, you'll have to learn how to program it. :)If you don't want to be bothered by programming the remote, hire someone to do it! You just saved a bunch of money on the remote, spend it on the programming and get the maximum potential from it!"
3,"Excellent functionality, but poor battery life","I found the programming software easy to use. (Check to make sure the software ships with the unit or is downloadable.) Everything is laid out nicely and the customizability is fantastic! You'll need to buy a USB/RS-232 interface cable if your PC is a recent model that lacks a 90's-style serial port.The one big gripe I have with this remote is that it guzzles batteries like a marathon runner in the Sahara. A set of four AAA's only lasts about 3-4 weeks, plus there's no low-battery warning before it stops working. When the batteries are almost gone, it will suddenly run a power-on self-test every other time you press a button. You'll definitely want a set of rechargeables for this one."
1,STONGLY DO NOT RECOMMEND,"If you are a professional installer or plan to hire a professional installer then this might be for you.I originally paid someone to install a home entertainment system and everything including the remote was working fine......until, I wanted to add a blu-ray dvd player. Getting something added to work with this remote is a major hassle. There is no online pdf available. To get the software, you have to register your remote and then wait...and wait some more until they accept your registration.The apparent strategy of the company is to make this remote installer friendly. A regular joe is helpless with this. Therefore they gain the allegiance of installers to recommend and sell this product for them. Anyway, I had a guy out today to reprogram it, figured all of this out, and now will have to have him come back later in the week. Today is a Saturday so contacting the company was not an option as they were closed."
1,This remote is absolutely the worst,"This remote is absolutely the worst as their is no software, no support and you must have a professional come out to program and pay another $250+ dependent on other equipment involved."
3,Great remote - if you have PC,"The installers of our entertainment system programed our remote. We've loved it for years. Now that components are starting to be updated or replaced, our remote is all but useless without being able to update it. We're a Mac only household and its seems really antiquated and backwards to hire someone to come over with a PC to program a remote. Will never buy again or recommend until the update to a Mac option. We could do a virtual PC terminal on our Macs - but again - what are we, running backwards?Too bad, love the remote itself."
5,Whisked away!,"I purchased this whisk because it sounded like a unique design, and after using it a few times (eggs and batter mostly) I think it's the best design out there. It does whisk things quicker and smoother. It is very easy to clean. No criss-crossed wires like in conventional whisks to trap food and cause rust. It feels very ergonomic too. The steel balls seem to do most of the work so your wrist doesn't have to. I suppose this would be a nice design for people with limited mobility. I liked it and am going to put some in the stockings of my ""foodie"" friends this Christmas."
4,The only way to make a pan sauce,"I have both the steel ball version on this page and theWMF Profi Plus Silicone Ball Whisk, 11 Inch.The steel ball whisk is perfect for assisting in deglazing fond to make sauces. The design of these whisks give you multiple contact points in the pan vs the single contact point of a traditional balloon whisk. These multiple contact points dramatically increase the speed at which deglazing and mixing can occur.I would warn that you would not want to use this whisk in a Teflon pan as it could scratch it I would use the silicone covered oneWMF Profi Plus Silicone Ball Whisk, 11 InchIt should be noted that I have damaged these whisks. Being used to a balloon whisk I applied more pressure than I should have. In a balloon whisk the pressure is distributed to two tines in this version every tine works on its own. Simple lesson, don't push like a brute. I learned it and hopefully you won't have to."
4,cute whisk,"I like this whisk a lot. It is very modern, attractive and whisks, but not better than any regular whisk."
5,Gravy maker,"This is it, I've been looking for a whisk like this for a long time.Easy to clean.Mixes everything quickly and evenly.I like to use it when making sauces, gravies, or anything stove top."

5,"Gone, but not Forgotten","Gloria Grahame was an extraordinarily talented woman and actress. She lived a very interesting life, both on and off the screen. Her performances are as good or better than some of the most famous actresses of her time, and I think she deserves the same respect and recognition they have received.Suicide Blonde is the only biography of Gloria Grahame that I have found. The back and forth style of writing, e.g. career life to home life, then back again, is not the kind of writing style that I normally enjoy. I got a little confused from time to time as to what films she was in at the time so and so happened in her life and then had to go back to try and figure it out. However, even with that said I can't find fault with either the content, which was very interesting to say the least, or how well written it was, especially the ending, which I found to be a beautifully written and moving piece.All in all it was a great biography and I hope she is never forgotten."
1,Where is my book??,"To ask me to rate the book is a joke - where is it, when will I get it and then I can rate it.I was forced to rate it ONE STAR because you do not have a MINUS staR!!The book was ordered in November 2009 and was due to receive it by 13 January 2010.My Credit Card was debited immediately!!It is now 29 March 2010 and I still haven't got it.Receiving your automated replies is most annoying!Surely their is one person in your Amazon site who can follow this up.This has gone far enough - tell me where the book is or credit my account with a suitable emailing me with your PERSONAL REPLY.If you think this is a bit tough.. you dead right.Action please!!"
4,Very informative! I Love my Leo!,"Absolutely wonderful, very informative! Every Himalayan cat owner will find this book amazing!P>S> I Love MY Leo!!!!!"
4,"EXCELLENT, SIMPLE, ENJOYABLE READING ABOUT HIMMIES","A MUST TO ADD TO YOUR HIMALAYAN LIBRARY. I GIVE THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE WHO PURCHASES ONE OF MY HIMMIES. THIS IS AN INFORMATIVE, EASY READING, AND EXCELLENT REFERENCE FOR FIRST TIMERS OF THIS WONDERFUL BREED. LOTS OF WONDERFUL COLOR PICTURES OF THESE BEAUTIFUL CATS. SOME OF THE CATS HAVE THE ""EXTREME FACES"" AND SOME HAVE THE ""BABY DOLL"" FACES. A GOOD BOOK WITH LOTS OF PICS TO SEE WHICH LOOK YOU LIKE BETTER. HAPPY READING!"
4,Himalayan Cats,"I purchased this book because I bought a Himalayan kitten. I have to wait one more week before she's able to leave her mother. The book was very helpful by telling me what I should and shouldn't do with a new kitten. The book gave alot of information about how to care for the cat thoughtout her whole life, not just another kitten book. I will not be selling it because I think I will be looking for it though out the years. It also had diffirent chapters explain what to do about breeding, grooming, and other things I needed to know. It is also written very clearly and easy to read. I was very happy with the book."
2,Good if you have never owned a cat before,"The book was well written. Chapters are informative for general information on keeping and caring for cats. however, the book was so general that i think they had a word document formated so all they had to do was insert the word Himalayan before the word cat throughout the book.the only specifics in this book related to Himalayans is the pedigree origination, and only in very simple terms, and grooming long haired cats and is generally applicable to any long hair cat.however, the book is loaded with really pretty color pictures of a diverse assortment of Himalayans.If you want a picture book with Himalayan cat pics and general cat information this is the book for you.If you are a breeder or looking to show Himies definitley look elsewhere, or you will be frustated that you spent the time and money on this book."
1,Useless for breeders/exhibitors /pet owners,"This book is so generic it is hopelessly useless. Save the [amt] orcat food or grooming supplies-you're going to need them. Even the chapter on grooming is useless. Follow the bathing instructions in this book to get a matted cat at the end. A little advise here for free: Do not rub the fur! Oh Boy! The instructions for blow drying! Blow drying a Himalayan is an art in itself and these instructions are worse than useless, might as well air dry the cat (Don't of course). The advise on choosing a cat is even worse. More free advise: Don't choose one without checking out the current breed standards - NW Region Himalayan Show cat exhibitor"
4,Himi Handbook.,"This book is well written and comprehensive. It gives a good overview and direction but for an experienced owner, it may be a little simplistic."
1,mis leading,I boght these batteries followed as directed they didn't work. The seller wanted to charge me twice for shipping. As far as I'm concerned Toolusa is a bad company. I will never purchase from them again.
2,Michigan Industrial Tools MIT 14.4-Volt cordless battery,This battery appears to be standard. However it does not fit a Sears brand cordless drill. The connecting neck of the battery is larger the port on the drill and can not be inserted. The battery was returned for a full credit. However my total shipping expense was $21. There is a need to provide specific products that this battery is compatible with.
5,Must read,"This book was in GREAT condition as promised. I am a Lisa Gardner fan and in the process of collecting all her publications. This book is a MUST, thank for your excellent material!"
3,Too Smooth,"This book was created under a great idea, all these different writers working together. But, unfortunately, to make the story run smoothly, each writer had to suppress their regular writing style to create a generic style. Nice effort, though. Wouldn't recommend buying it . . . get it from the library."
1,Sucked,Worst of them all . hate that you have to use so many words to rate on this website. Kind of crazy.
3,Decent hard rock record from Scotland's only hard rock band,"I can't think of any other rock bands from Scottland. Heavy Pettin sound like early Def Leppard. This is a good pop metal record. Some catchy riffs, the vocals get a little annoying, a little too high pitched sometimes but Pettin came up with some catchy riffs. Unfortunately the band dissolved shortly after this record. A 3rd record called BIG BANG should be avoided at all costs."
3,Once a fan always a fan,"Out of 12 songs I like 4 , but I adore "" Hoy LLeuve Hoy Duele. I listen to it everyday. Spanish is a beautiful language, and listening to Mr. Sanz is a gentle reminder of how elegant and passionate this language is. Plus his voice is magnifico. .. and always will be. It keeps me coming back. He is a wonderful songwriter.Vanessa.."
3,Buen album y mucho marketing,"Alejandro es un buen compositor. Es innegable.El disco es acepatable, diferente a otros. Pero la canción de autor comprometida debería ir en consonancia con una vida humilde, en fin...Lo que no es concebible es que un buen compositor como Alejandro, sea una super-estrella de la música. No es un figura y hay muchos compositores que le superan en mucho. Hay musicas mas completas y desde luego mejores voces.En fin, nada de particular, sino lo compras no te pierdes mucho."
3,no es lo mismo...no pasa nada...,"Estamos hablando de Alejandro Sanz, que siempre nos soprendio con canciones hermosas en cada disco que nos regalo. pero este ultimo disco como que el cambio que hizo no acento bien. try to save your song es cualquier cosa...y algunas otras..solo se rescata 4 canciones del disco cuando alejandro me acostumbro a escuchar sus discos de principio a fin. espero que se ponga romantico y fresco en su proximo album. pero este es el mas pobre de su carrera."
1,¿Esto es música? Patético...,"Resulta que un buen día este chico se puso a berrear como él sabe y los abrazafarolas aplaudieron sin cesar... No es lo mismo que 1000 lametraserillos te compren el disco, que 1000000 estólidos. Igual que no es lo mismo un guardameta que un guarda te la meta. Lo malo es que este tipo ha hecho escuela, de manera que él y sus congéneres están haciendo escarnio del panorama musicológico español. Es para colgar no sólo a A.S. sino a todos estos que valiéndose del poder de manipulación de las fórmulas radiomusicales, hacen confabulaciones contra la música de más alta alcurnia. En definitiva no merece la pena comprar este pedazo de trasto. No obstante, no hagamos leña del arbol caído, ya vendrán tiempos mejores. Mientras tanto, siempre diré que de bien nacido es ser agradecido, y por lo tanto me compraré el greatest hits de Manolo Escobar.WATCH OUT!!!"
3,"Bought it, heard it, .... moved on.","Just didn't do it for me I'm afraid. Hang on, I'll just go listen to it again.Nope, nothing for me. Same old, same old. Too many words in to short a time."
3,not bad..but could be better!!,"I am a huge Alejandro Sanz fan! Not only is he an incredible singer and songwriter, he's so damn sexy! But this album doesn't live up to my expectations. No doubt, he has some nice tracks (#2 is my favorite), but it doesnt compare to his earlier releases. Plus, I have a problem with him being with that model chick. Who the hell is she anyways? Well, Alejandro, I love ya anyways. Come do a show in NY, leave your woman at home!"
4,Change is always bueno...,"A mi no todas las canciones de este disco me gustan, eso si, pero siempre es bueno que un artista cambie de estilo, aunque sea un poco, no? Obviamente la musica de Alejandro ha estado cambiando poco a poco tras los años, pero se le nota el cambio mucho más en este disco que en los otros. Y la verdad no sé por qué todo el mundo hace tan gran cosa de que Alejandro está ""rapeando"", como dicen algunos.. pues OK a lo mejor eso se puede llamar ""rap"" pero eso solo es una pqa parte de una sola cancion y ademas el que realmente hace el ""rap"" en esa cancion es otro...Yo esperaba otra cosa. Pero bueno, total, recomiendo este disco..It's a pretty decent disc.. I like it quite a bit and I've been ""following"" Alejandro's music for about 6 years now.. not long considering how long he's actually been doing it. It's a nice change, even if it is only a little."
1,Definitely boring!,"I was told this album was very good, that is was different from other Sanz' producions, but all I can see here it's the same boring stuff. For sure it's different, but it it an 'empty' album, songs are not catchy at all, whereas he has done some good songs in the past. I love music in Spanish so much, but out there there are so meny composers that are long better than this one."
1,Does not need to be considered with Wakeman's other works,I own it. I listen to it. I've used it in church settings but I cannot recommend it for the casual listener.Underproduced. In great need of an objective ear when casting vocal talent and mixing music and vocals. I wanted so much to like this project and I cannot find it within me to do so.Sorry Mr. Wakeman. Please try again. I want this to work.
2,Cracks easily.,The first time I received this product there were fine cracks on the side so Amazon sent a replacement. I received the second crock in fine shape. A week later I again noticed cracks on the replacement item. I don't remember any incident that would cause cracks on this brand new item. I didn't bother to return it because it might just be the same story all over again.
2,Not Big Enough,Much smaller than it appears. Container is not as tall as it looks like in the photo and the mouth is too narrow to store large utencils.
1,Dirty Grayish White,"This crock looks true white online, but I received mine today, and it is definitely not. I held it up to my white trim, my white stove, my white refrigerator, and it looks dull and gray against all of them. I would like it just fine were it not for the color, but I've got to return it."
1,I didn't get to enjoy it,I was very sad that the item that I was so looking forward to decorating my kitchen with arrived in many pieces. It would be nice if the shipper put more packing material around it. Remember that some items have to travel a long way with the infamous US Post Office.
4,It looks great in my kitchen,I really like this utensil crock. It is sturdy and substantial and looks good. It's much better than the plastic crock I had before.
5,"If you've never read a romance novel, start now!","Let me tell you this: Kristin Hardy knows how to tell a good story. Her characters are likeable and identifiable, and she captures dialogue so well. (Not to mention the steamy love scenes - wowza!) I was absorbed with the plotline, particularly Stef and Sabrina and their volleying feelings for one another. After all, they *are* working on a documentary called True Sex. (By the way, Hardy handles these scenes tactfully.) Without giving too much away, I must say that the concluding chapter is one of the best endings to a novel I've read in a long time.The secondary characters are fun but don't detract too much from the main story. And Sabrina's girlfriends (Sex & Supper Club) are the kind we all want: Funny, open-minded, and non-judgmental.It's the perfect end-of-summer read.P.S. Her website gives you the scoop on upcoming novels - can't wait to read more! www.kristinhardy.com"
4,"Toddler loved, mom approved","My little girl loves this book. It was her go-to book for almost 2 months worth of bedtime story time (which is a warning to parents). The stories are easy to follow for the under 3 1/2 crowd, and good for older kiddies who are learning to read--there's a lot of rhyming and so on. For the interested parent there's an explanation of phonetic theory in the back of the book and how things relate to each other. The artwork is nice and some pages have fold out sections."
3,"Bile, A.Headcharge, Needulhed, Razorblade Smile get 5 stars","The album was Great as far as tracks by A.Headcharge, Bile, NeedulHed, and RazorBlade Smile go. ALex Xenophon, and Broke Box had horrible vocals on the album. Bile covered Tourniquet and in my opinion did the best cover on the album. Any true Manson fan should purchase this album regardless."
4,Get centered,A nice 20 minute warm up to get you started in the morning. After a week am very comfortable w/ all the motions. Took a little longer to coordinate the breathing.Any one can do this.
3,A bit disappointed,David performs the A.M. routine. It is great. He is a great speaker. He moves and flows well.CJ McPhee performs the P.M. routine. Her speaking was loud and robotic. No rhythm. Distracting. Lighting was poor due to p.m. shooting time.David should have done all the routines.
5,AM/PM T'ai Chi,"If you are used to a sweat producing workout, this isn't for you. For focus and balance it is perfect."
5,Big fan of the P.M. portion,"I am on amazon tonight buying my third copy. I have lent out the first two and never got them back so this one stays with me! I found the A.M. chi to be sort of hokey but the P.M. to be quite soothing. Not disrespecting DDR: I know he is very good at what he does, I just didn't like this particular routine."
3,Price is right...,"I wish they had been more forthcoming with what is actually on this DVD that amounted to the total number of minutes advertised. There are basically 2 short routines, with about 5 minutes of blather at the beginning of each. The other length of time seems to go toward an interview with one or the other of these people. Why exactly do I want to see an interview with either of them, I don't know? And, there's a plinky-plunky ""relaxation"" CD included. If that kind of a-rhythmic stuff doesn't drive you crazy, then I guess that's a nice bonus. From my tone, you can tell how well this practice is working for me...."
2,Not enough,"I had a wonderful VCR workout from David-Dorian Ross with this same title. I don't have a VCR anymore and I've purchased two DVDs since that time thinking I was getting the same workout as my original. This DVD is extremely mild and not what I was looking for. I probably won't even use it. Its probably great for someone looking for a few minutes of calming movements but the original one had arm movements, lots of twists and balance movements as well. When I was finished with that Tai Chi exercise, I was really energized and ready for the day."
2,Average,"The first reviewer nailed the problem with the DVD. The two instructors are like night and day. CJ is awful. I found her style grating and robotic. My children(3 and 5) really enjoyed doing the Tai Chi with David's instruction, but burst into tears when they heard CJ. They kept pleading with me to, ""Turn the mean lady off"". I will have to return this disk :("
5,One For The Kids,This is a softer side of Yellowcard. It's toned down. But it's still an amazing album. This was the album that got me drawn into listening to Yellowcard when I heard the song October Nights a long time back. This album is a great album to listen to when you are just chilling and kicking it. There really isn't much to say about this cd except for it's amazing and of course a must have!
4,"Very, Very Nice.","I first heard of Yellowcard from a friend while at a Homegrown show in New Orleans. In good faith, I decided to check them out.I bought their EP first, and I was impressed by it. Naturally, I eventually bought this cd, One for the Kids, and was even more impressed. All of the guitar/violin work is really well written for the type of music it is. Songs like For Pete's Sake and A.W.O.L. just stick in your head all day. I only wish that each instrument could be heard a little better (clearer drums, louder guitar, etc). That's the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars.I haven't gotten their new cd yet, but I'm sure I will eventually. It's always scary when a band puts out a new cd. Have they changed their style? Have they lost something that I liked about them? I hope not! I'll always enjoy this cd, no matter what, though!"
4,"yellowcard,- ""one for the kids""","before this afternoon, my only exposure to yellowcard was hearing the band's name thrown around once or twice. then, into my lap, one of my friends puts it.this is near the top of what this genre has to offer. Almost on par with taking back sunday's ""tell all your friends"", ""one for the kids"" is breakneck emo-pop near it's pinnacle. in a genre marked by mediocracy, this disc brims with what one might almost call originality. Much is made of the fiddle used on a few tracks. In the grand scheme of things, I'd have to say whoopdie-do. but considering it's competition, this is a very wonderful thing.Ryan Key has a perfect voice for the sound, and the lyrics are genuinely good. simply put, yellowcard knows what they're doing, and they do it well."
3,Good Album-Not Great,"I really like how they use the violin in this release. It makes them unique in the punk/pop genre. Even though the riffs are unusually hard and catchy, they do impelement the violin VERY well. But lyrics are kind of corny. They have a few acoustic songs on here, they arn't really good. The best being ""Cigarette"". ""October Nights"" is the best song on this CD, and its probably the one that got you listening to Yellowcard to begin with. You wont have this CD spinning for a long time. All in and all, its a good album. But no-where near a classic. Yellowcard has potential to make a great album, as you can see in their Underdog EP. They are gradually getting better."
5,great CD,This is a great punk CD. The violin adds a lot to make their sound more original. Most of the songs have a emoish-punk feel to them and i dont have any favorites because every song is good. Another great punk CD is Perhaps I suppose by Rufio
4,Good music,"I was quite surprised when i first heard the violin. And it sounds pretty good too. They arent the best band out there but they're original and they have a good punk emoish sound. Some of my favorite songs are starstruck, cigarette, and october nights. Also, the singer has a good voice. If you like The Get Up Kids, Thursday, Further Seems Forever, try this."
5,yellowcard rocks!,"I am a student at Westlake High School in California, and a few months ago Yellowcard gave a live concert at my school during lunch. All I have to say is that these guys rock!! They have every making of a punk band with a cool twist of violin. Rock on guys!"
4,buy the enhanced version : ),"This album boasts some of my favorite yellowcard songs, like ""Sureshot"" and ""October Nights."" It's a little more punk than the well-polished pop-punk of ""Ocean Avenue"" but still very catchy for those of us with mainstream ears. HOWEVER-if you spend any time on their website, you'll learn that ""Rough Draft"" is probably the most popular favorite song of Yellowcard fans and you have to buy the enhanced version to get it!"
4,best band ever,"one of my really good friends is a huge Yellowcard fan. At first I was like who is this Yellowcard she speaks of. But then I went out and bought their CD and I absolutely fell in love with their music. I wasn't really into punk or rock, but listening to their album made me want to experience a wide range of music I know is out there. I read an article on Ryan and just reading how passionate he was about the direction of the ""Only One"" video made me think that he's really into his music and puts heart into the music he writes. But I know that Yellowcard wouldn't be so successful today without the different and heart felt ideas Ryan's bandmates put into the music they create."
5,Yellowcard<33333333,"Many people reconized Yellowcard when their hit albumn \'Ocean Avenue\' came out. If you are abosoultly in love with Yellowcard, then I a huge fan, reconmend you to check out their underdog EP as well as their first album One For the Kids. You\'ll love them both. Yellowcard never lets their fans down."
5,Great!,I LOVED this album. My favorite song had to be 'Drifting'. The vocals were amazing and I loved the lyrics to every song. Yellowcard is one of my favorite bands. I encourage you guys to buy this! <3
5,differnt,"this cd is diiferent, i hve a really wide taste in music from hardcore bands like zao, and as i lay dying to this popy kind of music. Yellowcard is my favorite band, i own all of their albums. But for those who are into yc just to be with the latest thing, they wont like this cd as much. The lyrics are straight forward, no hidden emo messages. The songs are not as catchy as the are on ocean avenue but still really good. But for people who liked ocean avenue THE WHOLE ALBUM not jsut the popular songs i would recomdend this."
1,Switch to natural products,"We have since switched our house to natural products and no longer use products like these that contain sulfates, fragrances, etc."
4,From heaven (or near it),"The acoustic is rather distant and hollow. In other ways this DVD is close to opera heaven. The sets and costumes are very pretty. The orchestra plays and chorus sings with vivacious sweetness. Some may find Villazon overly hammy. For me, his loveable klutz Nemorino is a delight. Netrebko plays the smitten Adina, who hides her feelings under a flirtatious veneer, adorably. These two lovebirds sing with full-throated ease. D'Archangelo is perfect as Dulcamara: cynical, knowing, confidently seductive, and sonorous. The only slight disappointment is Leo Nucci. Not because his singing is less than polished. But in this company his blustery Belcore registers as a bit of a stage cliche."
4,"Wonderful, except for...","I agree with all the good comments here. But am I the only one who finds that there's something wrong with the miking? The recording mikes seem to be too far from the singers, so that the orchestra and soloists are sometimes out of balance. I keep having to adjust the volume level. Other than that, it's gorgeous...netrebko and villazon are wonderful..."
2,Donizetti's L'Elisir d'Amore,"I'm not sure of the quality, this was a gift. The label on it said it was for sale in South America only."
5,Best Elisir ever,In my opinion this will become a classic in the same way the Lisbon Traviata or the Milanov Gioconda became classics.Netrebko and Villazon are pure magic together.Don't miss this one.
1,A coloratura-challenged Adina,"L'elisir d'amore is a light and funny opera, so a recording of it would make a good gift for somebody who is relatively new to opera. This particular recording won't make a great gift though. I think Anna's timbre is too dark and Slavic for this light role. The main problem is that her coloratura is so weak that she fails to be a vocally credible Adina. I grant that she has good chemistry with Villazon and that her acting is decent. But opera is music first and acting second. Musically and technically, Anna is only a mediocre Adina, and no amount of acting can make one overlook this basic problem. Villazon delivers a good Una furtiva lacrima, but there's no sufficient reason for buying this recording, when there are many others of better quality out there (for a great Adina, see Angela Gheorghiu in the Lyon Opera recording; for a great Rodolfo, Pavarotti remains unmatched)."
1,DVD-L'Elisir d' Amore-Donizetti,"After trying 2 copies of this DVD by Virgin Records, I concluded that the recording itself (not the individual disk) was defective. The audio recording was uneven in volume. So the item shouldn't even have been released in my opinion. Amazon was very prompt and cooperative in sending a replacement for the first disk and for accepting returns twice and agreeing promptly to a refend. Five stars to Amazon; One star to Virgin Records for releasing such a poor quality product.It's a great piece of work, and I would love to have the DVD, if Virgin can correct the audio problem."
3,Hunks don't wor!,"I'm sorry, BUT hiring young ""hunks"" like d'archangelo and Schrott as Dulcamara just doesn't work for me. They sing with too heroic a tone,and don't play with the language enough. If they are SO good-looking why doesn't Adina fall for them and why do they have to resort to selling a ""magic potion""? The staging was just haphazard and I felt they had to make it up on the spot. No matter how much gray they put in his hair, Dulcamara comes off as just too young!Nucci sings well, but looks too old, particularly with the ill-fitting soldiers costume that does not flatter him. He sings it very well though. Netrebko is beautiful and sings beautifully. Villazon is so lithe and agile and puts so much into the role that I hate to carp about the somewhat muscular ""Una furtiva lagrima"", and the encore just seemed like a planned trick for the DVD.The chorus had nothing to do. They moved like a group with no individual characterization."
3,Some of this is outdated,This would be a good book if some of the material was not outdated. Alot of it is still true but it would be a good one to revise. Also it could use an index. It got old fast going through ever single question and it would be bad if you were looking for something specific. The grouping could have been better too. If you have got the time..it is a ok book. I would probably give a revised version 4 stars.
2,Intended for kids,"I bought this book thinking it was a fun-trivia book for adults. Oops! It seems to be targeted at kids. Much of the information is common knowledge among adults, and the explanations are not terribly surprising or engaging. Furthermore, the language is rather simplified, and the whole approach smacks of a children's book (maybe ages 10-15 or so). Maybe the author went overboard in ""keeping it simple, stupid""--so there's not much profound information here."
2,Boring - has done much better!,"After Sloughing through the most dull first chapters I have ever read in any true crime novel, I hoped it would catch on. It never did. I don't advise reading this story - you won't miss anything. 2 stars just because it is Ann Rule, who usually is very good."
2,Pretty boring,"I devoured ""The I-5 Killer"" and ""Small Sacrifices"" over the course of three days and couldn't wait to read another Ann Rule book... but this one was the worst, and I've read almost all of her books. I could hardly get through it and if I hadn't been stuck in the hospital, I probably wouldn't have. I agree with the reader who said it could have been condensed into one of her true crime collections. I only give it two stars because Rule wrote it, and she can make almost anything interesting."
4,love true crime books,I was able to keep up with the order in which the events occured without much effort. That means a lot when you only have time to read a chapter before you have to go to work or other things. But one thing that did tend to drive me crazy was the author's cont. comments about the allegedly beauty of Pat Allanson. From the pictures that were in the book except for when she was three I thought maybe the author was being fecisious. Pat may not be ugly but beautiful is a little over the top. The women has buck teeth for goodness sake. And that picture of her in a two piece were not exactly model looks. I also had a hard time feeling any sympathy for her victims except the elderly ones. Her oldest daughter for example was given many clues about what her mother was doing and she chose to ignor it as did so many others. Since that was their choice I find it hard to feel sorry for them. Of course her parents got just what they deserved. Anyway except for that loved the book.
2,It was just okay!,"The way it was written the story read like a dark comedy. For instance, when Pat Radcliffe accuses Walter Allanson of exposing himself he denies it by stating the he hasn't had sex in years because he can't get an erection...his lengthy explanation is so quirky it becomes comical. Then there's the chapter where Tom Allanson hides in a hole in the basement of his parents home, and Walter pokes him and yells to his wife ""I got him trapped in the hole."" All of the characters are very eccentric and quirky, and it's so hard to take them seriously because the way their actions and mannerisms are presented the story reads both bazaar and farcical. Nevertheless, Pat does indeed come off as manipulative, sinister, and evil in a very real way. I think much of the book was padded, and the story could have been told using far less space than it did."
1,Tedious at best,"I have read many of Ann Rule's books and found them all compelling, informative and fascinating, except for this one. The story seemed to drag on and on, and could've easily been condensed into 20 pages and included in one of her Crime File Volumes instead. I carried this book around for over a month and only got 1/2 way through it before I skipped through the last of it and then gave it to my sister. Without having said anything to her, she said she found it incredibly boring, not a typical Ann Rule book, almost as if she hadn't written it. She gave it to a friend, another fan, who in turn was also very disappointed, and never finished it so... Sorry to say I would NOT recommend this book to anyone."
4,ANOTHER GREAT ANN RULE BOOK,"Although this is not my favorite Ann Rule book, it rates right up there. Ann Rule has the ability to take a crime against another person and turn it into a fascinating psychological study. In this case, the author studies the main character's incredible ability to manipulate other's to do her will...or die. This book is a real page turner and a more than satisfactory read for those lovers of true crime or psychological studies. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
3,Just ok...contains spoilers....,"First of all, this book was way too long and filled with repetitive details. Second, I had a real problem with the author coming off as if Tom Allanson had absolutely nothing to feel badly about in reference to the murder of his parents. I just feel like some details about that day in the basement were sort of rushed past.In terms of Pat, what a disgusting, pathetic person. The very thought that she was released from prison TWICE is horrific to me.This was a compelling case, but definitely not Ann Rule's best written work."
1,Boring Murder Mystery,Nothing new here. Evil woman incites husband to kill welthy parents. gets caught. So what? Not even going to try to sell this one. Really a bore.
5,Pat Allanson a spoiled brat her entire life,"I can't much improve on the one review where the fellow who wrote it said he wish he could've reached into the book and strangled Pat Allanson.This sociopath was never made to face reality. But, then again, her mother indulged in illusion. Marguerite had three illegitimate children before she was 20 years old by a married man, but acted as if she was this paragon of virtue and looked down her nose at everyone else. Meanwhile, her precious daughter, who drove her own brother to suicide, is ruining lives right and left.I think the entire family was nuts and if Pat Allanson got the opportunity she would just repeat her past conduct because she knows her family...save the only sane member, her daughter, Susan...will continue to defend her and cover up for her!Heaven preserve us from people who think they are entitled to everything they want and don't care who they run over to get it."
4,"Hardly a ""Nice Southern Family""","I have just finished the book, and although I thoroughly enjoyed it, I have to disagree with Ann Rule's description of the characters as people from fine, southern families. These are and were common, low class, trashy people. They would be less than ""nobodys"" in any town, much less an old southern town. The story was intriguing, but misleading. These people would be the equivolent of ""Jerry Springer"" guests. Since when does a military background characterize one as ""fine?"" If you readers could see the actual locations in which these events took place, now AND then, it would not be hard to understand my point. And what ""refined, Southern family"" has multiple women bearing children out of wedlock before the age of 15? Puuuullleaze! The people depicted in this book are common trash, which is fine. But let's not mistake people who own a few horses and who purchase some land in an undesirable location as lovely."
3,Ditch the Drum machine...,"I bought the CD for rendition of ""Don't Let It Bring You Down"" used in the movie _American Beauty_. The rest of the songs are OK, but too much ""techno"" and ""drum machine"" fill in."
3,Written by other artists!,"Her follow-up solo album sounded okay, but all too distracting while I was listening to it was the fact that the songs were written by other people! I hope that if Annie Lennox does another solo album, the songs are at least original."
2,A Home Has Made A Failure of Success,"This album is dispassionate, over-produced rubbish. All the songs have a sugary, syrupy, chirpy glaze of adult contemporary pop goo that I can't seem to scrape off. I don't hear the Annie Lennox I know and love - the one who broke my heart with the song ""Cold"" and then mended it with ""Precious"" - I don't hear the emotion of ""I Need You"" or ""Shame."" What I hear instead is someone who's fed up with the music biz having fun at a karaoke party. But then, with a husband and kids, what does Annie have to moan about anymore?"
4,Almost great,"The first 6 songs on this cd are nothing short of terrific, then it bogs down a bit. But that's just me. Many listeners will be intrigued by the more indulgent sounds of ""Downtown Lights"" and others like it but I prefer Annie's knockout versions of classic rockers like ""Train in Vain"" and ""Take me to the River"" that storm through the speakers like gangbusters. I still insist that Ms. Lennox could hum the theme from Gilligan's Island and it would be better than anyone else out there currently."
4,Annie Changes Faces Like Medusa,"This 1995 follow-up to Annie Lennox's classic solo debut ""Diva"" found the singer sifting through her favourite songs and reworking them to her image. From the very familiar (""A Whiter Shade of Pale"") to once very obscure (""No More I Love You's""), the Scottish treasure grafted a coherent collection of tracks that still bears the synth-heavy stamp of Eurythmics work, but nevertheless sounds fresh and does not let go even after many listens. Procol Harum's pale shade is as lush and peaceful as the original, even more so when juxtaposed to Neil Young's haunting ""Don't Let It Bring You Down,"" a version so good that it merited use in one of crucial scenes of essential 1990's movie ""American Beauty"". The album also ends on a high note, with sublime cover of Bob Marley's ""Waiting in Vain"" and gentle remake of Paul Simon's hidden gem ""Something So Right."" The pieces Annie digs will please her fans, too."
5,Medusa Review,This album is one of few where all the songs are good unlike most albums that have a lot of filler.
1,A BAD RIPOFF OF FRIDAY THE 13TH,"Ummm...let's see, a group of kids goes to a cabin on the lake and gets killed by a crazed maniac wearing a hockey mask. Gee...never heard of that plot before. How original. Where did the braintrust of Memorial Day ever think of such a fantastic plot. These guys are geniuses! Seriously now...that is the plot...and unabashedly, and pretty much shameful ripoff of Friday the 13th, and the producers don't seem to care one bit. This is one of those films where it was the first...and only acting credit of the cast involved and one can certainly see why. It's absolutely atrocious. Beyond bad. Have these people ever had a single drama class? Did they rehearse? It's shot poorly...the special effects suck...just bad all around and if you rent this you'll lose 80 minutes of your life that you will never get back. Don't say you were not warned!"
1,Pray for this movie to be over,"The tag line on the back of the movie says pray for this weekend to be over but it should read my title instead. The movie is little over an hour but suffers from poor camera work. The camera is out of focus and looks like its on zoom thru out the movie. I thought I had pressed the zoom button by mistake but that was not the case. All in all, it was a bad movie and no one should subject themselves to it."
5,Steve's best so far,"Twenty-nine years of growth in his composition, technique and arrangements have produced this, Steve Hackett's best work to date. This artist is much more than a musician yet his musicianship is unmatched. Over the years, he has written some of the most captivating music of any genre. Steve's work carries the listener away, as music is meant to do. It is impossible to say ""Darktown"" is his best work, because his work is all good. But it is his newest, and certainly his most mature. It is his best. Thank you, Steve. Be happy."
4,Solid from start to finish,"This being only my 2nd foray into the solo material of Steve Hackett (the first being ""Watcher of the Skies: Genesis Revisited""), I wasn't sure what to expect. I wasn't disappointed at the samples I heard in the store. Hackett samples various different styles, using each song to tell a tale or express an emotion. The last track, ""In Memoriam"" reminds me a little of King Crimson's ""Starless and Bible Black"" with its somber melancholy tones.The experimentation and musical ""stretching out"" leaves me wondering why Hackett and former Genesis bandmate, Peter Gabriel, haven't worked together more since their respective splits with the former prog-rock supergroup. Genesis truly ceased to be Genesis when Hackett left."
4,Brooding and enthralling,"Steve Hackett has defined the prog-rock genre without being in its spotlight. Ask most people on the street who Hackett is and they would probably answer ""Steve who?"" Yet, since the years after his departure from Genesis, Hackett has produced some of the most entertaining and captivating music caught on record. He shows that he has a tender side on albums like ""Momentum"" and ""A Midsummer Night's Dream,"" but then turns the tables and offers up a good dose of rock n' roll (""The Tokyo Tapes,"" ""Guitar Noir""). ""Darktown"" lies somewhere between the two. The album opens with an amazing bass guitar lick that throbs throughout the course of the song. This kind of guitar play is rampant through the album; Hackett is a true master of the instrument. Some of the songs may not be cohesive; a couple lack direction completely. Still, give this album a listen. It is worth the admission price."
4,Updated prog,"This 1998 recording is a solid piece of work. Hackett has updated his sound so that it comes across as being quite relevant as the last millenium came to an end. It has, at times, a somewhat industrial sound particularly with the drums but is balanced by enough warmth to avoid a cold off-putting sound. This is a creative, reflective and yes, dark recording. Hackett has never sounded better as a vocalist. In fact, on the one cut where Jim Diamond sings it comes across as somewhat disappointing as his style just doesn't suit the music as well as Hackett's. His guitar work, as always, is terrific. Where Ian McDonald makes an enjoyable appearance on sax it is brief. Overall, this is a highly enjoyable disc one well worth buying...Simon"
3,"Well, its just ok, relaxing thou","this is a really cool release of some music you probably will never want to hear again, but hey, some music is just ok, first time is always the most intense.i liked it though, was creative enough, i suppose."
3,"this is just the original game with no gore or blood, title is misleading","I bought this thinking it was a third title from this series and its not, its just the low/no gore version of the game, i would only buy this if you cant find the other two versions of the game considering this is an old game now the gore on here isn't really gore compared to the games that are being played in 2011"
4,Relatively good stuff...,This isn't exactly the best album in the history of rock'n'roll (that would be Are You Expierienced?) but it just doesn't get me the way Hendrix usually does. But its a must for any fan.
4,The Fred Durst guy is off.,Wow. Im speechless. That guy is so painfully stupid and undereducated on what music is that I am in pain. This is a great guitar record. Get it. It's worth it.As far as that guy goes. Why dont u be buyin a few books and learn English.
5,A Classic,"Axis as bold as Love is one of three albums that were released while Jimi Hendrix was still alive, if you dont count the Greatest Hits package he released.Included are Castles made of Sand, which has some outstanding guitar on it.If 6 was 9 is also on this effort.The real find on the album is the recording of Little Wing.Little Wing is not only well done as far as guitar but is among the best lyrics you will ever find by Hendrix or anyone else for that matterThis album is not usually mentioned a lot but those who have it, cant stop playing it.If you havent heard much Hendrix or if you are exploring Hendrix for the first time, this is a great CD to check out."
4,What can I say?,Some songs I realy liked and some I did'nt. I re-lived some of the good things in my past.
5,"Okay, Axis! Here we come!","This, of course, is Jimi Hendrix's second album. It's not as immediately accessible as hisfirst album, but it's great in it's own way. It just takes a little longer to grow on you. Hendrix continued to redefine what a guitar could do, in his own inimitable way. It's great, but it."
3,Be careful bass boost,Anyone considering purchasing this title on Legacy should be aware that the has been very significant bass boost applied to the vinyl release of Axis. Appparently this sounds the same as the previous universal re-issue and on my system it results in unacceptably boomy bass on many tracks(Rega turntable). I have several other copies of Axis (including an original Australian black label Polydor and the Classics mono re-issue) and none of them have this artifically boosted bass response.
3,Let down,"Well upon arrival of the package I was impressed,the packaging for shipping was great ,packaging by the Manufacturer was great. The insert and album cover were pleasing,album was on center,and the new vinyl label insert I really liked. Upon playing the album,I immediately noticed the Bass imbalance that some people are complaining about,I just turned down my bass on the reciever and the problem was solved,no problem there. HOWEVER !!! There are no knobs I can use to help the big letdown I had with this album,and it is the only problem I found. When ""If Six were Nine"" played all of the opening verses were nonexistant.Put your ear to the speaker and they were in the background,as if someone pulled one of the speaker plugs-the one the vocals would have been coming from.The vocals come back in, halfway through the song."
4,Axis Bold as Love CD/DVD,"Best mastering of Hendrix I've heard since the orig LP'sWorth the investment in my humble opinion.Nice packaging and booklet too.I bought the 3 orig releases, then bought 3 more for an old high school buddy.great price at amazon."
1,Axis lyrics mixed out (Axis Bold As Love - Jimi Hendrix),"A great album on vinyl, but I noticed the latest CD mixed out the opening lyrics for the masterpiece, ""if 6 was 9."" This type of remixing is also noticable on other Hendrix songs and albums as well (e.g. ""purple haze"" lyrics on the Experience album are barely noticable on the latest CD, etc.). This is unacceptable, and changes my review of a 5 star ""album"" to a 1 star ""CD."""
2,Why Do We Romanticize the Dead?,"There is probably no one in entertainment history who accomplished less aliveand had more adulation dead than Jimmi Hendrix. If he is the standard, Adam Ant and Spandau Ballet should have died young- they'd be first ballot Rock N Roll Hall of Famers. WTF??"
4,a god on cd remastered,"as a hendrix fan I had to buy this cd just to update my hendrix documentary! But what a shock to hear this remastered version of hendrix songs that usually every hendrix fan should know from the original LP! Hendrix is a guitar god and in these remastered versions of the old songs there are whole guitar sections just remastered to be in the ""backyard"" of some songs, so that you can hardly hear them! So to be brief, if you are a real hendrix fan, and you've already have the LP don't buy the cd, the anger would just be to big!"
5,not the most famous but still great,Axis is often an overlooked hendrix album. People tend to focus a lot on are you experienced and electric ladyland but axis bold as love stand out as a really creative album. Hendrix adds a lot of depth to his lyrics with songs like castles made of sand if 6 was 9. There are also songs like she's so fine and got me floatin.
4,Could be better...,"""Axis"" have been a classic for over 40 years, so i'm not going to review the album, but this Deluxe Edition.The remastered sound is really an improvement if you only listened to the first pressings of it on CD. But, if you already have the '97 remasters, it's just the same thing.I'm givin' it 4 stars because of the dvd. It's so short, that i really wonder why not to put a CD of demos or live recordings from the era? It would be so better."
5,her music still lives on,"Brenda is one of the greatest music artist in Africa, she represents an african successful woman whith great potentials of serving her country through the art of music. She still lives inside of those who trully love her, because her music is still alive, her music still lives on.~may she rest in peace."
2,"Uninspired, repetitive","I found every track except one (13: Dstar's Mirror Image) to be incredibly repetitive-- starting with a simple riff or loop and then just getting stuck in it. And the riffs were pretty uninspired at that, hardly worth repeating ad-nauseum. The editor of this collection must really get off on bad trance. There's lots better out there..."
4,Nice reference when first learning.,"I purchased this book to assist my home schooled children in learning to draw maps and charts.This book covered various types of maps and charts with colorful illustrations and simple directions.It dealt mostly with things such as drawing your neighborhood, symbols, bike trails, and scale drawing.The back has a small section about cartography, the process of gathering information and how the map is created.All in all this was a good beginning, but don't neglect simply handing the kids blank paper, pencils, rulers and such and seeing what they create all on their own- you might be as surprised as I was.A very inexpensive reference book that would be a great addition to your home library."
1,WTF??????,I ordered this video from the seller and I never even got it or a message saying I woudnt get it. He just kept my money and kept in moving!
2,Average at best,"hard to Believe that Sidney Poitier went from Directing a Classic Comedy like ""Stir Crazy"" to this Music Video not ready for MTV type of Film.very 80's Campy&it was Corny then as it is now."
3,Truly cheesy fun!,"I originally found this musical gathering dust at the local video rental shop. Directed by *gasp* Sidney Poitier, it is a truly dated masterpiece as it follows a group of energetic small-town high schoolers seeking fame as a dance troop in the big city of New York. Not only are the original songs poppish and typical of any mid-80's Top 40 song written by Madonna or Rick Springfield, they are also highly addictive! So addictive you could bang your head against a wall a number of times before losing the peppy themes and your consciousness. I truly recommend seeing this movie after a bad day with a big bucket of popcorn and a six-pack of your favorite adult beverage. It will make you laugh and appreciate the evolution of man! Happy Viewing!"
5,Great,My item came early and in one piece! That's good enough for me and I am happy with the service I received.
4,Extra Cheese,"After watching this movie, you can definitely tell why it wasn't nominated for the best movie of the year! Regardless of how extremely predictable and corny the plot is, it's actually become one of my favorites. It's a carefree, relaxing film that captures the feel and style of the 1980s. Additionally, I like this movie because it's an excellent workout. Try one of the dances and you're guaranteed to break something (hopefully a sweat but in some cases a limb or furniture)."
2,very dry,"This was a tough book to read. My father, aunt, and I are all avid readers and fans of Milne and all things Pooh. But this book was very dry and agonizingly slow. Interesting in bits and pieces, but none of us could finish the book. In my family that is a rarity for any book. It is really about the life of the son of the original author of the Pooh books. You do get a usual sense of the frustration of those who have famous parents here. The bset thing about the book was the 6 pictures in the book. They feature the original pooh toys, the real pooh sticks bridge, and the real hollow tree in England that A.A. Milne used in his stories. I was really looking forward to more."
4,Fun Classic Sci-Fi,"This is an interesting and exciting show. I was never aware of it when it was on TV. The basic concept is fresh and the idea of a segment of society emerging with special abilities and powers seems seems to have inspired (or was stolen by)the more recent series ""Heroes."" This is a better show and it's unfortunate it was not on the air very long. The first 3 seasons are by far the best. Like many shows afraid of cancellation, it gets ridiculous when grasping for ratings near the end. However, it's definitely worth a look."
5,A great series,"I only caught a few episodes of the ""4400"" on television. I liked them so much I ordered the first season and enjoyed it more than any recent sci-fi program on air. When I saw the second season was coming out I pre-ordered it too. The second season is as good (if not better) than the first. This series is a welcome addition to my DVD collection. It will be interesting to see how the writers develop and keep this program unique and intriguing."
5,4400,I have been waiting for months for this to come to dvd...so glad the wait will soon be over..4400 is one of my fav...babylon5 to me is still the best but 4400 is a close second
1,What's up with this show?,"Too many characters, bad acting and crappy writing. I just don't like the show. Sorry but that's my opinion."
2,A season hard to get through,"Loved the first season but this year looks like the creators and writers weren't sure what to do going forward. Do we make it an X-files or X-men rip off (or a combination of both) or a 4400 of the week where we explore their lives and how their abilities have changed them. They went with the latter and it got old real quick. Not until maybe the last 3 episodes, did anything intersting happen.It looks like season 3 has more potential but that remains to be seen."
4,Good show,good show but there are only 3 or 4 seasons available. since it will be cut short I am a little dissapointed with that.
5,The 4400 - The Complete Second Season,If you're a 4400 fan you got to have this. I think the second season if better then the first!
4,Best take on Urban Legends Yet,"Initially The 4400 looks much like all the other series that have sprung up since The X-Files but most of them have had the look and feel down but severly lacked in story/plot, characterization/drama and the continuity required to be taken seriously (refering to X-Files earlier seasons only).The 4400 not only nailed it with an original and well thought out premise but also trumps even the X-Files (especially in continuity and writing), in creating intrigueing characters and situations steeped in just the right mood to pull in the viewer like no other series has.All the 4400 DVD sets are a must for any Sci Fi/Mystery fan and well worth the money. I own them all and look forward to owning the followiing seasons (though for me, they dropped the ball with the Isabel character in the 3rd series which 'seriously' compromised the show in the ""being taken seriously"" department)."
2,Same problem with video after 18 months,"IT no longer works after 18 months - had a nice picture and was happy with the product, but very disappointed with the longevity of the internal components."
1,LCD Failed display.,"After only 13 months, the LCD picture failed to display sharp colors, but instead would blink from bluish to greenish to red hues... Neither Maxent of California nor Amazon would assist me with this problem... Expensive lesson learned... Don't rely on reviews that have not stood ""the test of time."""
3,A Teen's Point of View,"This is a pretty good book, but it's a bit complicated. I didn't like it as much as Shearer's Bootleg. This book did make me cry a little, though. I liked this book, but the ending isn't that great. I like happy endings and happy stories, and this book isn't either of those."
2,not scoopable!,"our cat adjusted quickly toFeline Pine Scoop Cat Litter, 10.1-Pound Box, and it worked better than all the clay stuff- so we assumed this was the same product. NOT SO! As other reviewers say, this is basically the same stuff as the fuel for pellet stoves and equine bedding- big fat large pellets that do not clump, scoop, or break down quickly. I can't recommend this one at all, especially as others have said- you can get it for 4 or 5$ at the feed store as equine bedding.I really wish that other product (Feline Pine Scoop) was offered in a much larger size and/or as a subscription item, as it's (almost) perfect for our older cat: it covers the smell, is easily scoopable, and is a small sand-like texture. Yeah, it tracks easily, but in comparison to clay and these pellets, it's great."
1,Cats Don't Like it,"I have one cat that I adopted and that cat had to do her business in this stuff for the 11 months she was there. She doesn't use it here as I also have the regular clay in the other boxes. Even when the other boxes are full she still goes in the other one.My other cat peed in it and it stunk. Took a while before it soaked up the smell. I think he may have used it one other time. Box has been sitting there now for 6 weeks. They dont use it.They ""say"" clay is bad. Clay is a natural substance. In fact it's used medicinally (have you ever taken a clay bath to pull toxins out of your body?)."
3,"I like it, but the cats don't.","I loved the way it absorbed & soaked up the cat urine, leaving a piney scent. but the cats loathed both the smell of pine & the hard goatfood-pellate shape on their dainty feet. Perhaps if they would grind it into something finer. Some of the pieces even get lodged between their little toes.The other problem is the tiny amount you get & how much it costs. I have a lot of kittens & a lot of litter boxes to clean several times a day."
4,No smell!,"We recently added a cat to our family. We have never had a cat, so cat litter was a learning process. I tried many brands and have decided, hands down, that Feline Pine is the best. There is litterally no smell. I do like the pellets better, but scooping is a problem unless you have the right kind of scoop, which I do not yet. I am waiting for mine in the mail. You can't buy one, but FP suggests that you can just break out every other piece of plastic on your current scoop. I am just using the clumping until I get my scoop. It works just as well except there is a tracking problem with it."
1,Expensive ~ Go To Your Local Feed Store,"I am continually amazed at how much pet stores and retailers selling pet supplies charge for basic stuff. Feline Pine is no exception. I switched my multiple cat household to pine pellets, and for the first time EVER, I don't smell cat urine. However, I don't buy Feline Pine. Go to your local feed store and buy the 44 pound equine bedding pellets for about $6-7 per bag. HUGE savings and the same stuff!"
3,"Good Urine Odor Control, None for Poop","Pros:No urine smell. I remove urine powder every day.Natural.No tracking!Not too expensive.Cons:Poop smells, as it isn't buried."
1,ME CAT NO LIKEY,"My cat didn't like, waste of money for me. And ya was surprised to see it was just horse bedding pellets."
3,A little known secret...,"IF (and that's a big if) you can get your cat to like this kind of litter, it's great. You have to mix clay and the pine pellets together for quite some time before they adjust. 2 of my 3 cats like it, and thankfully the third cat would prefer to go outside. Well, Feline Pine is a great concept, but it is soooo much cheaper to go to a feed store and buy a 40 lb bag of HORSE BEDDING. It is the same exact stuff, tightly compacted pine pellets. I was using Feline Pine for a few months before my coworker suggested I go buy horse bedding instead. Feline Pine: 20 lbs for $15 OR horse bedding: 40 lbs for $6. It works exactly the same and lasts just as long. The only difference is the Feline Pine has a stronger pine smell. Save yourself some money and go to the feed store."
4,review of FelinePine,"This product is nice in that it disintegrates the urine therefore causing less of an ammonia odor. The price is right as well!Feline Pine Original Cat Litter, 20-Pound Bag"
3,Feline pine original cat litter.,"I have no problem with the shipping. However, my cats don't like this litter. I have mixed it with one they like better and I am hoping that things will get better."
2,Wanted it to work but had to switch ...,"I LIKE HOW IT SMELLS AND I CAN DEAL WITH THE WAY IT CLUMPS (OR DOESN'T) BECAUSE I CHANGE MY CAT LITTER OFTEN NO MATTER WHAT I USE. I HAD TO SWITCH FROM CLAY BECAUSE MY ANEMIC FIV+ CAT WAS EATING THE LITTER. I TRIED THE WHEAT BUT COULDN'T GET PAST THE THOUGHT OF ATTRACTING OTHER THINGS THAT LIKE TO EAT WHEAT. MY PROBLEM WITH FELINE PINE IS THAT MY CAT STOPPED USING THE CAT BOX WHICH HE HAS NEVER DONE BEFORE. I THINK HE DOESN'T LIKE TO ""DIG"" IN IT OR IT JUST DOESN'T ""COVER"" THE SAME WHEN HE DOES. I WILL CONTINUE MY SEARCH FOR THE RIGHT LITTER FOR MY FURRY BUDDY."
1,waste of money,"Go to your local Tractor Supply Store or Horse feed store and buy ""Pelleted Horse bedding"" TSC has them for about $7 for a 40lb bag and its the same exact stuff as feline pine."
1,My cats won't use it.,"They may dislike the feel of the pellets. Also, they do manage to track the stuff, dirty, around their litter pans. Not something I will inflict on them again."
1,Smells disgusting and tracks EVERYWHERE!,"This litter smells worse than the most hideous smelling poop my kitten, Willow, has ever produced. Also, the saw dust is used is so light that, while it doesn't create the same dust as many clay litters do, it is easily kicked out of the litter pan when Willow is covering her waste. In fact, the first night, she kicked literally half of the pan contents onto the floor. I decided to get a covered litter pan-- that helped, but did not stop the problem. Also, this litter tracks all over the apartment-- it appears in every room, on every surface that Willow has visited. Not long after vacuuming the floors and furniture, we still need to brush off saw dust that has transferred to our clothes from the couch. I'm so disappointed in this product!(I bought Feline Pine at a store, not through Amazon.)"
3,Not for my cats,"While I love the idea of using a renewable and natural product, particularly one that gets tossed every few days, the odor with this product is almost as bad as the odor it's supposed to suppress. My three cats wouldn't go near it. Perhaps the aroma wears off soon enough, just not soon enough for me. In addition, the pellets are quite large, not the fine, sand-like quality my cats are used to. I'm sure it works well for some felines, just not mine."
5,Natural Cat litter---I feel green,"One of the reasons I love pine litter is because it is just a natural product. You can flush, put in yard or throw away and not feel guilty. I hate all the fake scented cat litter. Feline Pine just smells like pine. After you scoop, you can mix up the litter in the box and it will dry. You just add a little more into the box and it's good to go. Very rare that the cats drag the pine pellets out of the box. If some get out, you can just pick them up off the floor and put right back into the box. The pellets are large enough to handle. I have three cats using one large box and it works out fine. I think it's a great product and the only litter I will use for my cats. In the summer months I scoop out the box and dump the litter in the yard near the pine trees. That's a great feeling! You can't do that with normal cat litter."
2,Hidden costs,"This litter does work pretty well. It doesn't track, controls odor well, and my cats liked it. However, when cleaning you will have to scoop a ton of the litter out to get the cats pooh and the remnants of pellets when they break down to saw dust after being peed on. This makes you go through a ton of this stuff and you have to make sure you clean it every day if not twice. This, plus the fact it is expensive to begin with, makes it extremely expensive."
2,do not buy,"this stuff sucks. let me explain it does clump nice and is easy to keep the litter box clean, but this stuff gets everywhere. It sticks to the cats feet then gets all over the floor and any furniture the cats may jump on its just a big mess. If your thinking about trying this don't, save yourself the mess and stick to scoop-able clay pellets/balls it actually stays in the litter box unlike this feline pine."
1,"for cat pee only!!! can't scoop poop out, stinks!!!","This is a cruel joke for cats owners. 1. the pellets are too big for poop scoops, so you can't get the poop out without ""playing"" in the crap! 2. pellets are too big to smother the stink from poop, when your cat goes #2, YOU'LL KNOW! 3. older cat wouldn't use it. I bought this stuff at walmart last night, I come home to a house that smells like it's been painted with manure! I tryed to get the ONE pile of poop out and just smeared it all over the end of the scooper. on my way to the store for my ARM AND HAMMER SCOOPABLE right now."
2,My Cat Hates It.,"I was shopping at my local Kroger and saw this on clearance for 2 dollars, I always wanted to try feline pine so I figured I'd give it a go. I poured the litter and was very pleased with the smell, my apartment smelled like the mountains :D. My cat is 14 weeks old and completely litter trained and has never had an accident... until we tried this stuff. She wouldn't even go in the litter box and stood on top of her litter box staring at me like I was crazy. I woke up this morning, walked to the bathroom to find to my surprise a huge turd on top of the toilet seat... Needless to say we won't be using this stuff anymore."
3,Not for my cats,"I want to like this product. I really, really do. It's definitely better for cats (one of mine has asthma, and clay litters bother him a lot), and the fresh pine smell is so much better than perfumed litters or kitty waste. However, this stuff tracks everywhere! I stopped using it three weeks ago, and I'm still finding little bits of pine all over the house and in my laundry. One cat is a chronic litter digger, and the other is a Maine coon with furry toes that catch everything, so even with a covered litter box and a bath mat in front, little tiny bits of the broken pellets get everywhere. Maybe if your cats are neater than mine, this is a good choice."
4,Love everything about it but the pine dust,Have been using feline pine with our three cats for nearly five years. The only thing I don't like about it is the pine dust that your left with once the pellets get wet and break down. We have found that every other day we--meaning me--have to clean the litter box to remove the poo as well as the dissolved pine. A small colander works great to separate the still usable pine from the dust. I would give my first born to the person who designs a self cleaning litter box for this litter :)
1,Allergic reaction,"My kitten's eyes got mucous, so much so that I had to clean her whole face with a warm wash cloth each morning. After calling about the rest of the litter she came from and finding out none of her siblings had eye problems, I realized the one thing different was the new pine litter. After going back to regular litter her eyes cleared up.Too bad, it really cuts the odor down a lot, plus the litter has a nice pine smell. Apparently it is too strong for my kitten."
4,Feline Pine - easy to use,This litter makes it easy to clean only those areas where the cats have peed. It has a nice smell too.
1,This is NOT flushable!,"I don't know who's in charge of watching out for mislabeled products, but I was very annoyed after searching amazon for ""flushable cat litter"" and ordering the first thing on the list, just to find out it's not flushable. Not only is it not flushable, it's about the least flushable cat litter I've ever seen. My cats hate it, and refuse to use it. One of my cat is running around frantically crying because he doesn't know whats going on with his litter. Worst litter product I have ever seen. Do not buy."
2,Won't buy again,"Initially, I was so pleased to find this litter. Finally - a lightweight box to carry up the stairs. I'm recovering from back surgery so thought this litter would solve the carrying problem. I changed out litter yesterday and my two cats used it last night with no problem. I came home from work today and more than half of the contents of the box was on the floor. What a mess! I know this litter is lightweight, but this is ridiculous. I'm going back to Arm & Hammer Essentials Natural Clumping Cat Litter (not found on Amazon). I wasn't crazy about the fragrance, but it too is lightweight and sure worked better than this Feline Pine."
1,Not what I expected,"I use the feline pine kitty litter, and I thought it was the same. The kind I buy looks like chips. This looked like little pellets that you would feed to a rabbit or something. I do not see how it could be used as litter. I wasted my money. It is non-returnable so I guess it just goes in the trash and I'm out 16.00 bucks. I thought I was saving money, but actually I wasted money. Not happy."
4,2nd solo.,"Lindsey's 2nd solo is ""Go Insane"" #45 in 1984. This one is totally different than his 1st release ""Law And Order"" in 1981. This is more electronic, but with L.B.'s strong sense of pop-rock sensibility. You get these strong tracks: ""I Want You"", ""Go Insane"" his 2nd top 40 hit #23 hot 100 and #4 mainstream rock. You also get ""Slow Dancing"", ""I Must Go"", the extended beautiful ""Play In The Rain"", ""Loving Cup"" and ""D.W. Suite"" written for the late Dennis Wilson, who drowned the year earlier. Good stuff as always."
4,Cool!,"He sort of sounds like Prince on this one. The coolest things about this album are the cover, the side B. record label which contains his head (cool to watch spinning on the turn-table), and the coolest thing: ""Playing In The Rain"" does not quite end on side One, and starts up again on side Two. Never in my life have I seen such a thing. Also cool, the album was recorded in his garage. Uncool: The songs seem sort of simple and lack any humor. But this is a small point because L.B. is truely a fantastic guitar player and he has a haunting voice. Much better without Fleetwood Mac."
3,"It's not the best, but it is interesting","If you like the singing or guitar stile of Lyndsey, this is an interesting record for your collection. I prefer the record called ""out of the cradle"" it is a more evolucionated record into the style of Lyndsey. This record have the typicall sound and produccion of the 80's, and today perhaps sounds little rare."
3,Poor Man's Liar's Poker,"And the pretender's line up... My copy of this book had a prominently displayed endorsement from Michael Lewis. Unfortunately, Mr. Partnoy does not write as well as Mr. Lewis, and his sense of global market context is less developed. * * * Nonetheless, the story is perhaps even more compelling than Liar's Poker. Mr. Partnoy describes a system of outright thievery of (Carl Sagan voice) billions and billions of dollars. The transactions are well described, the stories absorbing, even if the drama and pathos don't shine through as much as possible. * * * Still, this is a good primer on the derivatives market for generalists, and not a bad airplane read, even if it may require some caffeine to maintain interest and salt to place it in the proper perspective."
3,"Informative and timely, but not totally accurate","I read the book with great interest as I'll be working in the derivatives group at one of the top players in the market upon graduation from college. Partnoy doesn't write as well as Michael Lewis, and the book in general is more informative than funny. There are also plenty evidences of almost compulsive exaggeration (traces of the author's salesman instinct, perhaps?) For example, I don't believe his description of the investment banking career is totally accurate. Nevertheless, I can't wait to start trading derivatives after I finished the book!"
1,factually incorrect,"As reader and one of the Pricipals the author writes about in his somewhat sad book i expected him to at least get his facts correct. It seems that all he did was review the newspapers for ""sound bites"" and fall into the trap of ""if it is in the newspapers it must be right"" how sad that a lawyer as well as a educater could take such shortcut maybe he is also guilty of what he seems so critical of."
1,FIASCO - Good name for the book. Save your money.,"I loved Liar's Poker, this is NOT as good. I've loved Pit Bull, but FIASCO stinks. Sorry......"
1,Sensationalist trash,"This is really a pile of garbage. A man decides to trash the people he worked with and ends up with so much attention. It's so sad because some of the people he talks about are simply brilliant. Yes, many things go wrong is the investment banking/financial engineering industry, but many things go wrong in any work place. What I find sad is that the book has attracted so much attention in the 'financial press' (well, those columnists need something to fill their columns with, and some of the stories that Partnoy has to say are 'gripping'), which gives the whole subject an unnecessarily bad name."
1,what a waste of time,The next time Mr. Partnoy feels the need to regale us with his observations on Wall Street I hope he will please spare the reader and keep them to himself. My two year old niece could write a more interesting work on derivatives. And I'm sure it would not be half as self-serving as his. It is hard for me to believe that a publisher actually thought this book was worth publishing.
4,Teaching lecture,"I have been waiting for half a year until the book was published in German. I am a stock broker in Germany and I must say: This book teaches what professional business means. You can have the imagination, that all the derivative business stinks upto heaven. Partnoy described himself very backkeeping and hard-headed, not at all egocentric and shelfish, but I think you must have those characteristics to have success. Yet, I must congrulate Frank to his premiere as an author"
4,"A quick and fun read, somewhat informative too","Frank's story of his life as a derivatives salesman is a light and fun read. The most informative aspect is his insight into the culture of his ex-employers, Morgan Stanley & Co. and Credit Suisse First Boston. One chapter about creating an MBS derivative for Japan was fantastic and very informative. As a whole, the book made me anxious to get a job on a derivatives desk."
3,"a quick read, sensational","Interesting read, if not particularly deep. People should avoid drawing general conclusions about the derivs world from this book, because there is no 'representative picture' of what derivs are about. Actually, people could just as easily get shafted with ADR stocks traded right here in the USA, but people haven't written books about that which intend to keep everybody out of the stock market. In any event, a little research suggests that the 'Queen of RAVS' is Janet Tavakoli, author of a sound book called 'Credit Derivatives', for anybody out there tough enough to understand the technical, serious side of derivs (cf. Partnoy's p. 111 in the paperback ed. and Tavakoli's p. 185). It is interesting that the cover of Tavakoli's 'CD' does not mention that she worked for Morgan Stanley. -Kevin Rosema, Rutgers/JPM"
4,Pleased,"Although it wasw not as gritty as the original version, it was still packed with a lot of action and gun play. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,"Gena Rowlands, the one and only Gloria.........","Sharon Stone tried to be the tough taking ""Gloria"" but fell flat. They changed the story around from the original and that fell flat to. Sorry guys, but remember Grease II? Sharon, you are a good actress, but remaking ""Gloria"" was a huge mistake........"
1,Terrible Movie,"While the original Gloria may not be one of my favorite movies, it was very good. Gena Rowlands was amazing in the role. Those are tough shoes to fill and Sharon Stone completely failed.There is absolutley no chemistry between Sharon Stone and the kid. The acting was second rate and Sharon Stone's New York accent was unbearable.The 1980 version is recommended."
1,The worse piece of garbage movie I ever saw,It's amazing how some people gave this movie 5 stars. I could only watch it for 10 minutes - that's how bad it is. I wish I could give it 0 stars. Sharon Stone is the queen of all bad actresses. And can she shut up already about her high IQ and how smart she is. Smart women don't spread their legs in a major motion picture.
5,Great Banjo Strings,"Just about all that I buy for my Banjo. Have tried other strings, and some are good and some are not They have a nice balanced tone and I will continue to use them on my banjos."
2,Cheaply made,"This wine rack and wine glass holder was cheaply made. You could see staple or nail holes on the outside where every dowel was attached. It would not look good hanging anywhere it would be visible at even moderate distance, especially if you were to purchase it for display. I was dissapointed."
2,would be nice if it could be hung,Unfortunately in my house it is apparantly hard to find the studs in the ceiling so I have not been able to hang this. so far it has been a big waste. Make sure you will be able to hang this prior to purchasing.
4,Wonderful updated info,"Its hard to find a book out there on budgies these days that isnt outdated, this one is definitely more with the times, mentions a varied diet and examples of how to go about it, setting up your keet home before you bring it in and most importantly mentions common signs of illness to watch out for. All in all, a great read and I highly recommend it."
5,Karaoka Elvis Style,"Song selection is good and they sound pretty good to. Some songs here that arent in other selections, Not disipointed at all."
5,Holly Clegg's Trim & Terrific Home Entertaining the Easy Way: Fast and Delicious Recipes for Every Occasion,TERRIFIC! All of Holly Clegg's cookbooks and entertaining tips are wonderful! I highly recommend all of her books!
3,Good but not great,"While this book does provide a fairly comprehensive list of factory outlets, it is poorly organized and not designed for the short-term visitor to Italy. For exaple, Prada is listed under ""I Pellettieri d'Italia"", which is fairly useless for the average visitor.If you are planning on doing some serious shopping and will be in Italy for some time, this book is great. If you are only going for a short while, I would recommend doing an Internet search (you'll get the major outlets and much better directions.)"
5,A Great Read,"I loved this book.It was really easy to relate to. This book has comedy,romance,but is still serious. Marcy has problems with her dad, wich I'm sure a lot of girls can relate to. She is just your average girl,in a good way. She falls in love. I really think everyone is able to read this book. It's got a little bit of writing in it for everyone."
5,Really good book!,"I read this book like around Oct. or Spet. of 1999. I can't really remember it, but I remember I loved it so much. It was a really good and funny book and I totally reccomend it. I didn't read 'The cat who ate my gym suit', or something like that. I didn't know they had a first one hen I read it. I figured it out when I went on Amazon.com to check what people thought of it.You don't have to read the first one. You'll know about her past cuz she tells you."
5,I love this book!,"This book is the sequel to My Cat Ate My Gymsuit. Marcy Lewis gets the job at her old teachers, Mrs. Finney, arts camp. Everyone is nice expect Ginger, a young girl that can be trouble! She also has a boyfriend at the camp. Read the book! It's great!"
4,"Really neat book, but may not be appropriate for under 10.","I really liked this book. Marcy Lewis is really excited when her old teacher, Ms. Finney asks her to work at a art camp. Marcy thinks it will be simple, until she discovers rude Ginger is in her cabin.Also she has her first serious romance. This book can either be read after The Cat Ate My Gymsuit, or it can be read all by itself. SOme parts of the romance in this book might be not appropriate for kids under age 9 or 10."
5,Out Bat OUT!,"This book, to me, was GREAT! It made me want to go to camp. It had a lot of feeling words in it that made it like a Diary or a Journal. When it came to other parts, like adventure parts, it got me all excited. Like, ""WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? Paula Danziger is my favorite author. I hope she keeps writing books."
5,This book was excellent!,I think that this is a terrific book. If anyone liked the other books by Paula Danzinger than they will LOVE this one
5,So Helpful and Useful,"These books are some of the best. They are so well written and very very helpful. If you have never been to Las Vegas, there is almost nothing left out of here to help you on your way to seeing one of the best cities in the world. If however you've been to Vegas many many times (like myself), there is still stuff in here you never knew. It's completely up to date and the pictures are brilliant and the glossy look of this book makes it more magical. I love Vegas and even if you don't need a guide to the city, you have this as almost a keep sake. I would highly recommend this particularily to new visitors because of the amount of information. It is great for shoppers instead of gamblers, good for hotel recomendations and where to eat etc. This is one great book. I love it."
2,Kate is a wonderful Writer but I'm disappointed with this story...,"Kate Chopin is a wonderful writer. She has an amazing voice in her stories. I enjoy her writing in general, and I did like Story of an Hour, but there are a few criticisms I would like to share. For one, she did not have a lot of detail into it. Her plot was weak and didn't have really any falling action and the conclusion was the death of the Mrs. Mallard. That was kind of disappointing because I would've liked to know what happened afterwards. But I suppose that the ending was a ""twist"". But I must say that I didn't enjoy the ending. Once again I'm going to say I like her style of writing, and in general, I liked this story but there were some things she could have done better."
2,Story of an hour review!,"I do not reccommend this short story. It never really caught my attention. A few examples of why i did not like it because it talks about this women's husband abuses her and she is happy that he is dead and that she is free. Also it talks about how she dies because she has heart disease, i didn't understand i was very lost and confussed."
4,"It's not bad, but not great.","I recently picked this up after waiting for it's release since the second book came out. Richard Baker does a great job describing the details of the surface world and the Underdark. It seems to me he skipped parts and didn't describe battles, but flashed forward to after something happend. I don't know the reason why, but I found it slightly annoying. This book is a good read, and is worth it for those who have read the previous 2. The storyline is good, and the characters are developed quite well. He follows well to the rules of the AD&D world and does a masterful job in describing spells being casted.Definetly a good book for those already involved with the storyline. Looking forward to the next book, too bad its not coming out sooner."
3,Condemnation,"I entered into this book with high hopes, and for the most part I was satisfied. One point that I never settled with me was how in the last book Quenthel and Phaeraun seemed to be heading toward something, and then Baker went and changed that, not to mention Quenthel's gender preference."
5,Action and more action!,"If you like to read about armies going to war and heroes saving the day, this is a good book for you. The amount of backstabbing and political intrigue will also get you going in this book. Pharaun continues to be an enjoyable character, however, his actions against Quenthel have you wondering how much longer he'll exist if Quenthel has her way or is pushed too far. The portions covering the battles between the duergar and the Drow had you cheering for the Drow. Nimor is definitely an evil character you will learn to hate as the book progresses. I was a little disappointed that the battle doesn't get resolved between the Drow and the duergar by the end of the book. However, the battle continues sensibly in the next book so look for it there. This was a fun read. A little slow at the beginning but it picks up speed quickly."
4,It could've been better,"After reading the first two books in this series, I had very high hopes for this book. Unfortunately this book was not as well written as the first two, however serious fans of the series will be pleased with the general direction of the storyline and as with the first two books the ending will leave you with a dire need to read the next book as soon as it comes out. I don't believe the battles were described as well in this book as they were in the last two and there was also a disappointing error in the story at one point near the end which is why I can't bring myself to give this book five stars, other than those few problems this was a very excellent book and I would definitely recommend it to fans of the genre."
1,Condemnation,"This has to be one of the worst written books I have ever read. The author has written it as part 3 of a 6 book series and it is as though he did not bother to read the first two books in series. Full of contradictions, messed up character descriptions and is lacking decent character developement within the villians. What the hell was R. A Salvator thinking when he added this author?"
4,Nicely Done!,"I thought that this novel was a great continueation of the series. I enjoyed how Baker discribed the drow's reation to the worlds of light, but it confused me a bit when the drow ventured to Lolth's sacred temple in the demonwebs. Neverless, I really enjoyed reading this book."
3,"problems,problems, too many problems.",Yeah I barley got throught this book it was so boring. it pissed me off at times when it was really getting good then he changed it to a less interesting part of the story as if he was trying to keep you in suspense but all it did was make you mad.Another thing dafine already had a morning star and mail in the last book why did she buy a new one?Richard Baker is probably one of the worst auther of the series.
1,boring and stupid,The worst one of the series so far. Doesn't even seem part of the same series. Richard Baker you suck!!
4,Decent Early 80s Hard Rock!,"Heavy Pettin were a band from Glasgow, Scotland that never got the recognition they deserved. This album was produced by Brian May of Queen and released in 1983. The lead single/video was the classic In And Out Of Love (great riff!), better than Bon Jovi's song of the same name. Other good songs are Broken Heart, Love Times Love, Victims of the Night, Rock Me (great chorus), and Devil in her Eyes. The production could have been a little better (sorry Brian), but then again it sounds kind of raw the way rock should be. If you are looking for some good hard rock before the hair metal bands of the late 80s then I recommend this album."
2,A glider pilot redeems himself during a daring rescue,"When vertigo dashes Steve's hopes of becoming an airline pilot, he discovers the world of sailplanes, or gliders. But when he attempts to rescue a downed pilot high in the Sierras, will his old dizziness return?A very boy adventure from 1957, with lots of squared jaws and manly facing of facts. The glider information is interesting, the rescue is exciting, and Steve's disappointment over his vertigo is realistic and affecting."
4,Pretty good....pretty good,"I was happy to find this product on Amazon at a much lower cost than in audio shops. This adapter works well with my JVC; it's great being able to use my steering wheel controls with an after-market stereo.I really appreciate the fact that the adapter remembers the settings, so if your battery is disconnected, there is no need to re-program this adapter. My only complaint, after a year of ownership, is the slight delay experienced between when you push a button on the steering wheel control and the desired action of the stereo."
4,Works great!,"Easy to install and great instructions for the beginers. Although it is straight forward, I had to call tech support to learn I hooked it up incorrectly. Tech support was very helpful and put me on the correct path. Once I installed it correctly, it programmed very easily and worked great!!"
4,I used it 3 years now,"Is does make a lot of noise , it stays warm when pluged in so I unplug it . Coffee builds up between the base unit and the ground hopper in the upper side of the output area. Keep that area clean (like once ever 2 month ) and it will not dust your counter . In other words you are not seating the ground hopper in properly . Oily beans do seem to plug it up a bit using fine grind settings .I just noticed these reviews while hunting for a new grinder . I was getting a replacement prior to my attempt of clean this machine I was afraid it might die while under the screwdriver . I didn't even know it could be broken down for cleaning . So if it doesnt live through the cleaning I wanted a back up grinder that not a panic buy . Its also over 3 years old now it can not last forever (used 2 time each day ) . I make coffee on the stove with a paper filter using setting 2.5 and the coffee comes out like flour ."
1,Keep looking.,"This is one ""dirty"" machine. Grinds end up all over the front of the unit. Somewhat noisy, and the timer (sliding tab) that controls the thickness of the grinds is poorly designed. I will use it until it fails, but given the price, this is a very disappointing product."
4,"For the price, a very good grinder",The Capresso coffee grinder is very good. It just needs to be clean once in a while. If you want the best suggest Barista Burr Grinder. It cost 3 times more.
1,Not fine enough for Espresso,Total false advertising on this one. It does not grind fine enough for espresso. Barely grinds fine enough for regular coffee. Total disappointment. I threw away my blade grinder too! Why say that it does something when it doesn't. Obviously many people have had the same experience. Customer service was a joke when I asked them about it. I will never buy a Capresso product again!
4,Perfect for burr grinding starter,"Very compact design. Perfect for burr grinding starter with this price. On/Off buttom sometime a little bit tricky to use, but I can live with it with such low price and good quality."
3,buy the Capresso 560.01 instead,"I have owned both this model and the Capresso 560.01 ""Infinity"" model. I currently am using the 560.01 and strongly prefer it, despite the difference in price. The 560.01 gives a much more consistent grind; is much, much quieter; produces much less static electricity; and is relatively easy to clean. I wouldn't call the 551.01 a bad product, but I don't think I would buy one again."
1,"Terrible, overpriced","Upfront I want to say that this grinder does a nice job of grinding coffee beans evenly - all the coffee comes out about the same ""fineness"" or ""coarseness"" depending on how you set it. This is a good thing, and if you have ever used the really basic coffee grinders, you know they can't do this.However, its a pain to use this grinder. The receptical for the ground coffee doesn't seal well and coffee grounds get spilled, making a mess. Its also possible to start the grinder without seating the receptical, so that none of the coffee goes in the receptical and ALL of it goes spewing into your kitchen. To make things even worse, my receptical cracked - the plastic is just not very sturdy. And I can find out how to get a replacement. I would suggest either going cheaper and getting a basic Krups grinder, or spending a lot more and getting something more on the industrial strength variety. As another reviewer wrote, its a pity that a good grinder can't be had in this price range."
4,Great grinder and it DOES have instructions,"Hmmmmmmm,... not sure why Amazon didn't get an instruction manual with their #551. Mine came with one with sections such as ""Before First Use"", ""Grinding"", and ""Cleaning"". My grinder was great and I would have given it 5 stars except that Capresso never seems to staff their toll-free customer service number. When my grinder died I got tired of leaving voicemails and had to email them for return instructions. To their credit, they sent me a brand new (not refurbished) grinder.If you want a real grinder, not one that pulverizes the beans with a spinning blade, then this is a great choice."
1,Steer clear,"As others have said, the quality is just not here. Our receptacle also broke after a few months and the entire machine completely died before we had it one year. Keep searching."
2,capresso coffee grinder,"Does not grind the coffee as finely as needed. Confusing to operate, also. Would not buy another Capresso product."
2,"needs a lot of experiments, a little messy","I just got one of these burr grinders. I was a little concerned because of all those negative reviews. First, if you think you are using it for espresso, just forget. It is not that fine. The grind setting does work but not much difference. And the grind is not consistent enough. My favorite setting, if preliminary, for drip maker is '2', a little surprising. It also generates a lot of static electricity and the ground particles tend to stick to the walls, requiring much cleanliness. The grinder sometimes gets stuck with finer settings. I don't know how it gets stuck, but it does anyway. I haven't tried others grinders but I don't think there are much better ones within this price range. So if you can afford, go for the ones above $100."
2,Doesn't live up to early reviews,"I bought this item on the strength of the reviews on Amazon up to that time. I'm considering going back to a simple blade grinder, for two important reasons: the machine jams far too frequently, requiring shaking, jarring, or actually dumping out the beans to clear it. It is also surprisingly messy. (I keep finding coffee grounds all over our dark countertop.)The few pluses include convenient bean storage, compact size, and visual appeal (my wife says it is ""so cute"".)"
2,Crummy Design!,"I have a Capresso coffeemaker that is terrific. So I assumed the Capresso coffee grinder would please me just as much. Wrong! The difference in grinds on the various settings is negligible. And when I take the grind receptacle out of the grinder, the grounds fly everywhere. Not only do I waste a lot of great coffee, but I have to clean up the whole countertop. My coffee tastes great, but the irritation of this coffee grinder just isn't worth it!"
2,"Yes, it does spray grounds","Yes, as someone else noted, the container for the grounds has a lid and the grounds come out of a small hole in the front that feeds directly into the container. It still sprays coffee grounds all over, because the pieces don't fit together quite right. I even tried using rubber bands to hold the parts together and they did not help. My workaround is to put it in the sink while it runs so the grounds will be contained.After it is done grinding the coffee, the sink and the grinder are covered with coffee grounds, and cleanup takes a while.It gets two stars instead of one because it *does* grind the coffee, but there has to be a better way."
1,this is a rotten product!,"I bought this, it broke exactly one month past the warrenty date (one year) and the wonderful folks at Capresso were stunningly arrogant (even before they knew it was out of warrenty!). On top of that the very expensive Capresso coffee maker I also bought at the same time now leaks...let me put it directly: the products I purchased from Capresso stink! Period.Try Zabar's -- they have much better coffee bean grinders..."
2,Hubby loves it - I hate the mess,"I bought this grinder for my husband for Christmas, to replace the old blade grinder he'd been using for years. The burr grinder does a much better job of grinding for a wide variety of brews.The mess is a definite drawback. Once the beans are ground, the grind goes through a small opening and into the clear holder. Remove the holder and grinds spill out of the opening, all over the counter - this happens no matter what grind setting we use. Hubby now empties the grinder over the sink for less mess.Still, for the price, this was only a slight inconvenience. He's definitely happier with the quality of burr-ground coffee as opposed to blade-ground.Edited to add: a few months after the purchase, the ""bowl"" part of the grinder broke."
3,Stil works after 8 years,"I must have been blessed, with all these poor reviews regarding the quality, you think my grinder would have broke by now. However, I happy to report that my grinder is still going strong today. I do have to agree this is cheaply made plastic grinder, but I have to give it kudos for lasting this long."
2,Have a vacumn cleaner nearby,The messiest grinder I've ever encountered. The electrostatic charge placed on the beans as they come out of the hopper causes coffee dust all over the counter. I'll be replacing this as soon as I find something a little neater.
2,Good grinder...while it lasts,"I bought this grinder last summer and loved it. Then one day, after about 6 months of less than average use, it stopped working. I just turned it on one day and it didn't work. I tried calling the Capresso Customer Service number, but it's impossible to get through to. I'm still waiting to hear what they are going to about replacing or fixing my grinder (it's still under the 1 year warranty). My advice - pick something else or plan on replacing it every six months."
1,Overpriced and messy,This machine is not worth the price.... It's flimsy and lightweight. The grind is ok but it spews coffee all over the place. I should have payed more attention to the other reviews. Keep looking.
2,simply not worth the money you pay,"despite the warnings I found on reviews, I bought one, and was disappointed with it. First the grind is NOT consistent, just very slightly better than a $... blade grinder. Second the grinding steps don't quite work. It does have 17 settings but 1, which is supposed for espresso fine-grind, is just suitable for drip method. Third it IS messy. It does not spray the grinds as described in some of the reviews but actually there is no way to keep it clean but to be cleanly yourself. Go for a better one like Starbucks Barista burr grinder, Bodum burr grinder or Briel 'Java Bean' burr grinder."
4,Easy reading,Even though I have not finished this Newton book I have enjoyed his writing once again. Hunting Humans- was the first title I read and found this one to be just as entertaining (if I may call it that) The only times I felt a bit let down were when he mentioned a name I was unable to find any other information on.
1,The worst trance collection I have ever bought!,"I own maybe 20 discs, which 19 of them are trance. This is simply the worst collection i have bought. I was disapointed from the start all the way to the finish. It seemed i was listening to one song, every track seemed to be exactly as the previous. This is not trance, this is early 90's house music (the whole song is made of 3 beats, with absolutly no rythem, none what so ever, and dont be fooled by the famous names on the disc, like moby - natural blues you cant recognize it, it is a totaly different song with a 3 second sample of the original). Dont wast your money on this crap, get something you can acctually listen to. the only thing good about this disc is its cover design. by the way i am seling my copy(...)"
2,Why? Why? Why?,"Most of the tracks here are available on much better dance compilation CDs. About half of the anthems are getting very tired. I expected a fresh spin from the Gatecrasher crowd but this is just regergitation. A better compilation would be Ministry of Sound's ""Ibiza 2000"" which is also a 2-disc set and contains almost the same tracks."
3,Gatecrasher: National Anthems,"I liked the CD. It is good, don't get me wrong. But, if you love trace as I do, the Gatecrasher series is starting to become boring. Yes their packaging is 5 stars but a lot the music is already avalible on other comps. Gaterasher needs to go back to their basics and cut down on the number of tracks on the CD's and focus on the music like Global Underground. Remember, less is better most of the time."
2,NATIONAL ANTHEMS - Gatecrasher's Embarresment,"Two Words: Don't Bother.What has Gatecrasher Done? They dont do annuals. If they did, theyd turn out like this. Gatecrasher's Usual albums are expressing the new tunes that come out and become publicly known and nicely mixed, with the songs nice and long, to make you feel as though you were in the club. This is some messy song-slashing, rubbish editing, and dire songs onto two miserable 80 minute ""efforts""WHAT I SAY IS THAT YOU SKIP THIS ENTIRELY AND WAIT FOR THE NEXT RELEASE - GATECRASHER DISCOTECH GENERATION. Its got some great tunes, unlike this .. well you get the idea.Dont worry, I think the Next release is much better (Its already availible in UK)"
4,Beautiful!!,"Well, you know, I REALLY liked this CD-er CDs! The songs are so beautiful and reach almost an emotional level. They are inspiring, easy to dance to, energizing, and...just really beautiful!:)"
1,misleading title,"""Panama and the Sierras: A Doctor's Wander Days (1900)"" is a valid though misleading title. I bought it on the assumption it would help my research into what a doctor did in Panama before the building of the Panama Canal. Instead it is a wandering book of trips a doctor took through the Isthmus and up the California coast having so little to do with Panama that the name shouldn't even appear in the title. I feel I was misled."
4,Good supplement to online docs,"I have the first edition of this book. I purchased it when I started to use PostgreSQL to develop a retail reporting warehouse for our company. After a year of development I can tell you the book is worth the money. While the online manuals are much more extensive and complete they can also be quite terse. This book gives you the needed foundation you can then build upon by referring to the online documentation for PostgreSQL. Nowadays, when I have a question about the database server I always go straight to the online documentation but I also carry this book with me to work. I still find it can sometimes provide a more clear explanation of some part of the server than the online documenation can even if it is not always as in depth as I would like."
4,Excellent resource for any PostgreSQL admin,"PostgreSQL 2nd Edition is a phenomenal book if you're a programmer, and a great book if you're a non-programming admin. As someone whose programming ability reaches only ever so slightly beyond bash scripting and WSH, the parts of this book that were really worthwhile to me were those devoted to the administration of PostgreSQL. Backing up, recovering, and performance tuning were excellent resources, especially to someone who had never set up or administered a database. Speaking of which, the very beginning of the book, covering what exactly a database is, terminology, and setting up and creating schema were invaluable. To have all the information in PostgreSQL 2nd Edition consolidated in this one book makes it a must-have for any admin's bookshelf. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars from me was because I'm not a programmer, and I couldn't take away every single ounce this great resource had to offer."
5,PostgreSQL,"I bought the 1st edition almost a year ago. The book is perfect reference for me as a seldom database and SQL developer. Compared to Oracle books this one is clear and concise: I've found everything I've been looking for in perfectly complete and understandable form. Haven't read everything in it yet, though, but I believe no part will disappoint me."
1,Worthless and largely inferior to the official documentation,"I bought this book expecting to find a complete reference covering all aspects of daily operation of Postgresql. Instead I found a pile of worthless and incoherent chapters, covering anything and everything, from basic sql syntax to interfaces with several different languages, none of them covered deeply enough to be of any use. Worst of all, the index is totally unusable. Don't buy it, I'm sure there are much better books. You'll learn much more reading Pg's docs on their site."
4,Is a good book,"Is a nice book, it hasn't got many advanced stuff like backups or problems solutions but is a good book for people just become a middle or new postgresql user."
2,An irritating exercise into the world of pornography,"Hollywood Blue tells the various stories of those in the pornography underworld: stars, publicists, directors...While this might sound like an excellect examination into the underworld of pornography, Mr, Gaffin treads very lightly with many of his subjects and frustrates the reader who would expect a more detailed and probing anaysis of the adult entertainment industry. What makes this book even more irritating is the photo oppurtunties that Mr. Gaffin places himself in. One cannot take this book very seriously with Harris Gaffin mugging for the camerma in many of the photos in this book. Reccommended for masochists only."
2,Reads like a boring police report,"A dark alley, a stationary car, a gunshot... and the London police officer Toms is lying seriously injured on the street. Immediately his colleagues of Scotland Yard start a large-scale search to find the perpetrator. But when they finally find some important clues, the most difficult is yet to start: finding the evidence. Only one question seems valid: ""What should be done about criminals whose guilt is known but whom the law cannot touch?""The opening of this book, where police officer Toms is getting assaulted, has a lot of potential. Sadly enough, none of these possibilities have been explored in the further development of this rather plain story. It reads almost like a boring police report. Characterisations of the main figures are nowhere to be found, apart from some dry factual descriptions. The revengeful ending is a real bummer and has nothing to do with the story-line."
4,A man of many styles,"This is a very interesting CD. The songs seem to alternate between traditional jazz and latin rythems. The hermonica adds a unique touch. While this isn't one of my favorite CD's, I'd say it's worth a listen."
3,"Huw Lloyd Langton - 'Time, Space And LLG' (Allegro)","First came out in 1988, not sure how many times it's been reissued by now - maybe twice. Just as good as the original Hawkwind guitarist's 'One The Move...Plus' and better than 'Chain Reaction' disc {see my reviews of both}. Couple of the tunes I thought sort of stood out were ""It's A Work Of Art"", ""Mirror Image"" and the creatively played ""City Of The Future"". Basically, inspired guitar-driven rock to fully experience here."
3,A Solid Half Album,"I was buying vinyl albums when Double Fantasy was released, so there was no convenient way to get around the Yoko contributions, which is the way John planned it. He knew that fans were eager to hear new music from him and they would listen to Yoko as well, whether they liked it or not -- and I did not. Thank God for programmable CD's.Most of John's songs on this album are first rate, but I must admit that at the time I was somewhat disappointed. I expected more adventurous/progressive music from the writer of I Am The Walrus. I guess I shouldn't have, since John almost always wrote about his life experiences, and his last few years were spent as a domestic house-husband.I can't give this album more than 3 stars because it contains the Yoko rubbish."
4,Simply Beautiful Album by John Lennon..,"Every songs by John Lennon in these album are simplistic, beautiful, and sentimentally expressive. Women is one of my favorite John Lennon song because it shows his true inner feeling about Women. Beautiful Boy (Oh Darling Boy) is really nice lullaby which reflects John Lennon affection for Sean Lennon. (Just Like) Starting Over indicates that John Lennon started to come back to be triumphal in music again after his five years as househusband. John Lennon would be here by now to write many more beautiful songs but he was murdered on December 8, 1980. If you are really John Lennon fan, you should buy this album.. However, you should avoid listening to Yoko Ono songs. In my opinion, she can write a song but she can't sing. Her voice is really terrible. Here is my last word. Buy this album and Listen to John Lennon's song only."
3,"Joke-Oh, Oh-No!","John Lennon was a brilliant rock and roll musician, both as a Beatle and as a solo act. 27 years after his tragic death, I am still troubled by his indulgence of Yoko, whose banshee caterwauling ruins this recording much as it ruined anything of which she took part. Yoko is an artist without any artistic skill beyond manipulating an insecure star who never got over the loss of his mother. Her presence here ruins John's lovely collection of reflective tunes. RIP John."
4,"Not the end, a beginning.","The calling was clear : ""It would be just like starting over"". The song suits perfectly on the spirt of the album ""Double Fantasy"": after 5 years of isolation at their castle over the Dakota Bulding, John and Yoko put their feelings on the album, and showed to everybody what was going on between them. He wants to tell the world that she is the reason of his life as shown on ""Woman"" and ""Dear Yoko"". She puts barriers to make their love come true ( ""Give me something"") , but admits that she loves him ( ""Yes, I'm your angel"" ), and try to cheer him up ( ""hard times are over/over for awhile"", sang she in ""Hard times are over"") . It should be heard and appreciated, not only because it's the last album of John - but because it's one of the best."
4,A Story Of Rebirth and Death,"I remember the day John Lennon was killed. He'd spent years in seclusion and somehow many blamed his wife, Yoko Ono. Then he emerged and wrote some good songs for this then new album. They were his OWN, not those of Yoko, remixed or redone. He finally showed that he had a mind of his own. He got lost and then came ""Starting Over"" which he tried to do. And then he was gone. Being a collector, I rushed out and bought the record. I just wanted to have his last work and it was well worth my time and listening to it all the way thru. He is still missed and this last album made it clear that Ono was still the love of his life, even though there has continued to be bad press about her. I think he would be disappointed."
4,The Most Touching Thing Here is the Back Cover..,"..the large photo of John and Yoko on Central Park West,very near where the end came. (I have the original LP). The songs on this CD may be generally 2nd tier,though I still enjoy WOMAN, and WATCHING THE WHEELS. Thankfully, most of the rest are mellow, (i.e. not angry) tunes, but mainly ,unfortunately,forgettable."
4,ENJOYING THE SIMPLE PLEASURES OF LIFE!,"THIS COMEBACK ALBUM AFTER FIVE YEARS OF ISOLATION, SHOWS A MORE MATURE LENNON, SINGING ABOUT HIS WIFE, HIS SON AND THE SIMPLE PLEASURES OF LIFE. HIS LYRICS ARE, AS USUAL, PERSONAL, SIMPLE AND DIRECT. IF YOU THINK THAT HIS BEST YEARS ARE WAY BACK TO THE IMAGINE DAYS, THEN YOU'LL NOT ENJOY THIS ALBUM, BECAUSE IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE IMAGINE ALBUM. HERE YOU CAN HEAR A JOYFUL LENNON AS NEVER BEFORE: AWAY FROM POLITICS, AWAY FROM TRYING TO CHANGE THE WORLD AND AWAY FROM TRYING TO BE, WILLING OR NOT, A LEADER. MUSICALLY, JOHN, YOKO AND PRODUCER JACK DOUGLAS PUT TOGETHER A VERY SOLID BAND (TOP SESSION MEN). BUT AGAIN, HE WASN'T DOING ALL THE PROGRESSIVE ROCK HE MADE DURING HIS PLASTIC ONO BAND DAYS. HE RETURNED TO HIS MUSICAL ROOTS. IN JUST LIKE STARTING OVER, YOU GET A FEELING FROM THE 50'S. THIS IS A GOOD AND SOLID ALBUM, AND ALSO, A DIALOGUE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO LIVED A VERY INTENSE RELATIONSHIP (BOTH ARTISTIC AND PERSONAL)."
5,Double Fantasy! I love this album!,"Double Fantasy is one great album by John and Yoko! All the songs are really pleasurable to listen to, and once you do, you'll find yourself getting those lovely tunes stuck in your head for the rest of the day! They're great! Yoko puts forward some incredible work, and John makes an excellent comeback from his 5-year retirement! This album really gets you pumped! But I think the thing that I love the most about this album, is the ""Heart Play"" between two lovers, John and Yoko. For most of the songs, its as if they're having a conversation with one another! Its really cool! Double Fantasy is one of the best!"
2,"Good album, but poorly remastered","I don't have anything to add to the discussion of the musical quality of this album, but something should be said about the sound quality. In short, it's bad. Everything has been squashed to death through overuse of compression and limiting; the result is a midrange-heavy brick of sound that is just fine if your volume is set really, really low, but that seems overly bright and will quickly induce ear fatigue if listened to at more normal volume levels. When will mastering engineers wake up and realize that the purpose of re-mastering older recordings is to get the best possible sound out of the original masters, not necessarily to apply current production techniques without regard to the type of music or source material?Find one of the earlier issues of this album and buy it used. Your ears will one day thank you."
2,"Some good tunes, the rest is forgettable","Most of the work Lennon did here is classic and quite enjoyable. Yoko Ono seems to have been a great wife and influence on his life, but she makes Linda McCartney look like a singing star. Only Lennon and McCartney could get away with putting their terrible singing wives in front of a microphone and hitting record, and I think they did it only because they could and still sell records. Leave the Ono stuff off of this, and it becomes a 4.5 star album."
3,"John Lennon's songs are great, Yoko's are not!","This album is kind of a mixed bag some being great some are unlistenable. John's songs are great especially Starting Over and the best song on the album Watching the Wheels, Woman is also a Lennon classic. You can fill that Lennon fells great he's already been through his primal screams and his ""Lost Weekend"". Well I really Love all of Lennon's song on this album and some of them rate as his best. Then Why would I give this album 3 stars, well personally I think Yoko's songs are horrible and she dominates a lot of this album :("
2,sorry... but this sucks,"this album sucks. im sorry but i just cant make anything else out of it. the only track thats not weak is I'm Losing you. The rest is just sentimental crap without a bit of sincerity. why hasnt anyone wondered why the best songs Lennon had around that time were not on this.Im talkin about tracks such as Nobody Told Me or Serve Yourself and Living On Borrow Time. Albert Goldman has an explanation for that in his great book. This is defintely the worst music John made, and its really ashame cuz the songs mentioned above showed us his comeback album could have been great."
4,JOHN GETS 4 STARS...AND YOKO GETS 0...,"They say love is blind, but in the case of Mr. Lennon it is also deaf. Yoko ono cannot sing worth a lick, hearing nails on a chalkboard would more of a listening pleasure than listening to her sing. The Lennon tunes are masterpieces of course...but if u need to rid your house of unwanted relatives or maybe u need to get an exterminator to spray for bugs...well heres an alternative solution play all of Yoko songs on this album. Whats even worse is that she has a greatest hits album of just her songs..i don't even think she ever made even a dent on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart...maybe she a hit or two in Asia (where Alyssa Milano has musicial success) or Germany (where David Hasselhoff has had hit albums)"
2,Should have been a John Lennon Album,"It's one thing to marry Yoko Ono. It's quite another to let her sing on your albums. Yoko ruins this album. She sounds stupid, out of key, and like she's trying too hard. The songs themselves are not that bad (""Hard Times Are Over""), and had John, or someone with a good voice, sang them, they would have been good. Most of John's songs are pretty good. Really for fans of Lennon with Ono, only. This album makes me sad for John."
4,all i'm saying is give yoko a chance!,"yoko's songs are so amazing on this album. kiss kiss me love is great, and she was a huge influence on punk rock. it's a shame that her songs on this get skipped for some of lennon's worst work."
2,o.k.,"This would rate higher if Yoko's junk wasn't on here. I do like ""Kiss, Kiss"", but nothing else of hers. And John's stuff is pretty good, but whoever thought John would record such bland stuff? That's Paul McCartney's job! But John out-blands McCartney on this one. I do like some of the tracks. But they all have the same feel. It would have been nice to hear some old Lennon grit!"
3,What Did He See In Her?,"John Lennon possibly was the only person who thought that Yoko Ono had any musical talent. When I think of her meddling into the Beatles sessions after the White Album, it makes me want to puke. I don't blame Paul, Ringo and George one iota for being angry at Lennon. It would have been one thing for him to bring a talented musician into their inner sanctum, but Yoko Ono?As for this record, Johns' songs are good. Yoko's suck. Plain and simple. You can't make a greyhound out of a bulldog, and Yoko Ono can't sing, can't write, can't produce, isn't musical, and generally sucks altogether. It's a damn shame that she was able to get Lennon hooked on hard drugs in the late 60's, thus breaking up the greatest musical group in history. The Beatles were just hitting their creative peak. Just think of what could have been in the 70's and beyond!"
1,A shame,"John Lennon's solo work always was very uneven with the occasional genius track like #9 Dream, Instant Karma, or How Do You Sleep. But it's really such a pity that he went out with this total piece of MOR shlock. He sounds every bit the 40 year old bloke he was. Back in 1980 when 40 was 40. Yoko's track is the best on the album and the one thing she's done I really like. Walking on Thin Ice is a great pop song. She was hipper at 50 than John was at 40. But hey - age is just a number."
1,"NEVER RECEIVED ITEM, ordered over 1 month ago","I loved this cd when it first came out now i'm so disgusted with the waiting time, i don't even think I want to hear it. Has it even been shipped?"
1,Oh No!,"In a five year hiatus-this is what John Lennon produced--he used to do better every five months with the Beatles. Who knows what happened-the man who called Pauls music ""Muzak"" and who ridiculed Obladi Oblada now puts out this tripe. The best song on the whole album is Yokos ""Kiss, kiss, kiss"" Maybe John needed the angst of life with Cynthia and/or Paul to be creative. Stick to ""Plastic Ono Band"", ""Imagine"" and the Beatles albums to hear John do anything worthwhile"
3,Why 3 stars,Simply put the Lennon songs here are better than any songs he made since the Beatles broke up and some of his anger seems to be resolved and I pray at some point he gave his life to the Lord. Yoko songs are pathtic and thats why this album is 3 stars. GodBless
1,Lennon's Worst,"I read that the reason John and Yoko alternated tracks on this album (one John, then one Yoko) was because it wouldn't be so easy to skip the Yoko songs when one played it. It doesn't really matter; John's songs are almost as bad as Yoko's here. I can't listen to ""Yes I'm Your Angel"" ""Kiss Kiss Kiss"", or ""Hard Times Are Over"" without cringing! ""I'm Losing You"", ""I'm Moving On"" --- you name it, there isn't a single memorable tune. ""Double Fantasy"" got a lot of airplay in 1980, but it's pretty much mainstream pablum, like the Sinatra-esque stuff Lennon lampooned in his interviews. Unfortunately, Lennon's best music was far behind him already from his Beatle years, and this later collection was a hit only posthumously."
2,Not close to his standards,"It's a shame John came out of retirement to record these sessions. The tunes are just uninteresting. It's not unlike a musical variation of looking at someone's photos/slides of domestic life. They are only of interest and of value to the family in question. Only Watching The Wheels hints at John's talents. To make matters worse you have to put up with Yoko's songs which equal John's in number. As good a woman, mother and businesswoman she may be, she is a miserable singer-songwriter. Avoid this one and Milk & Honey buy Plastic Ono Band, Imagine, Walls and Bridges and Mind Games instead...Simon"
2,Mark Chapman made this a hit...not the music,"John Lennon was gunned down and that is a tragedy... no more of a tragedy than some kid getting shot in Harlem... but a tragedy nonetheless. He was a talented guy who used to make good music with the Beatles, and on several of his solo albums. However Double Fantasy is a lousy record... mostly due to the contribution of his untalented wife who occupies half the album with drivel. None of the Lennon songs compare favorably with anything he did previously."
5,"John-Great, Yoko-Uh... Not really....","This is one of John's best C.D.'s. The Yoko songs suck, but John's make up for it-BIGTIME! If you love the Beatles, you'll love this C.D. Poor John.... Died the same day he finished it..."
2,Sympathy for that one song? Is that it?,"Earl Slick and Rick Neilsen were the guitarists on this...album. But the juxtaposition of Yukko Ohno's...""songs"" in between every one of Lennon's, kind of make this, his final album - a joke. ""I'm Losing You"" IS a good song, though.."
5,John&Yoko,"John and Yoko loved each other very much; that's what this album meant to them. Yoko wasn't a good singer, but she was a creative songwriter.(It's called avant-garde; look it up) Let's not forget the fact that, if not for Yoko, most of the things we remember John for wouldn't have happened. He needed her and her support. If you think the Beatles are the end-all be-all of John's great music, then stay as far away from this record as possible. If you have an open mind, however, buy it and listen away."
5,Stinks,"This was not a good book to read in Prison. When released I had to wonder why all Freud followers had beards, they think Freud is the Father Psychology and copy him."
3,Sometimes Freud is just Freud,"This book describes religion as a universal mental illness, which says it all. As such, Freud predicts a time when we can rise above it.""Religion would thus be the universal obsessional neurosis of humanity; like the obsessional neurosis of children, it arose out of the Oedipus complex, out of the relation to the father."" If this is true, then Freud supposes that ""a turning away from religion is bound to occur with the fatal inevitability of a process of growth, and ...we find ourselves at this very juncture in the middle of that phase of developement.""It is worth reading quickly, as it makes the same few points over and over."
3,philosophy is not my bag,Not being a philosopher type makes this kind of reasoning very hard for me but members of our book club had many good impressions of this tome. Good book if you are a philosophy major.
3,Freud and Illusion,This is a very slim text that addresses some very big issues. I would recommend it as part of any Freud collection and also for any collection on religion. Certainly a requirement that one have at least a primer on Freudian concepts so the nature of Illusion can be placed into some kind of meaningful context.
5,Freud is always special,"I always enjoy Freud. When I saw the possibility of this book, I was elated! Thank you so much for the great service, and wonderful book."
4,A must-read for all that are interested in Psychology or just can't get enough of Freud,"This is a great read for anyone who is interested in the field of Psychology or Philosophy or anyone that is interested in Freud, whether an avid reader or new to his works. This book takes an amazing look and analysis of the world of religion and its effects on civilization and the individual, which can still be applied to our present civilization. Anyone who can appreciate the work of great thinkers will definitely enjoy this work. My only complaint is that it is so short."
5,One of a kind,"Viewer: Thalia del Fuego, belly dance teacherThis DVD is indispensible for anyone who wants to attain good body alignment and release from chronic tension. Not only will you feel better the next day, but you will have the added benefit of improved body awareness. Performing the exercises will help you become more conscious of your postural habits and the ways in which you hold tension in your body, so that you can change those habits.Despite many years of experience in the dance/fitness field, I have never seen a DVD of this kind. I was amazed to find that the exercises were completely unlike anything I have ever seen in other yoga, dance or stretch videos/DVD's. It is truly one of a kind."
5,Great relaxation workout!,"I've been following the exercises on this DVD for a month and find them to be relaxing and healing. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who suffers from tension-related shoulder, back and leg pains."
2,Good but not great,Took for ever to get the product. The item arrived after several e-mails back and forth with the provider. I expected the book to be in a little better shape. The book had an odor as if it had been left in a damp basement. I would not order another used product from this vendor. Spend the money and get a new fresh product.
3,Not THAT Great,"This album is constantly praised as a masterpiece, but I really don't know why. Jimi's first two albums are better. Out of the 16 tracks, there are only 8 that I look forward to hearing when I play this disc. It's still worth buying because 6 of those 8 songs are great! If you've never heard this album before, expect some greatness, but don't expect a masterpiece."
2,"Plenty of Filler, Lots of Great Stuff","This is Jimi Henrix's last record released while he was alive, and the first he produced. Like so many artists that take the helm on production, many tracks are left on a recording that should be left in storage. A 15 minute Voodoo Chile is enough to scare away the novice listener.Jimi's first two records (Are You Experienced, Axis: Bold as Love)were jam packed with short rocking tunes and soulful ballads, but Ladyland is very much the opposite.That's not to say there aren't amazing songs here -- there are plenty -- but this release could have easily been distilled down to a single LP, and would have benefited from the results.I would guess Hendrix understood the failings of Ladyland, as First Rays of the Rising Sun (Cry of Love for us oldtimers) saw Jimi working in his more traditional format."
5,My Favorite Hendrix...,"Because this was the only record Hendrix made during his lifetime that was completely under his artistic control, this record merits extra special attention. Electric Ladyland is a musical feast for the senses. From the first burst of feedback on ""And The Gods Made Love"" to the fade out on ""Voodoo Child (Slight Return)"" every note hits goes straight to the soul! I could go on for ever about specific parts of the record that I love but, I'll just simplify it and say BUY IT NOW!One more thing, if you are new to Hendrix, don't buy greatest hits collections! The three studio albums he made in his lifetime are all perfect and should all be in your collection."
5,It's unanimous!,"Isn't it? Hard to find a bad word to say about this last Experience album. Most obviously, some of Hendrix's most popular, coolest tunes are under this cover-""Crosstown Traffic"" and the mesmerizing ""Voodoo Chile(Slight Return)...but just about everything here deserves some merit. Sides two and four are crammed full of energetic blues rockers, all brimming with glee as if Hendrix knew he was making a great record ""1983..."" is a psychedelic triumph unmatched by anything in his career til this, a long unfolding, swirling, bubbling tale of learning to live underwater. Liner notes by the man himself are in a very Bob Dylanish pseudo nonsense style, evidently Dylan was a big influence on him, he sure does make ""All Along The Watchtower"" come alive (but don't almost all Dylan covers eclipse the originals?). All three Experience records are unique in their own right, and each equally excellent."
5,"MEET YOU IN THE NEXT WORLD, DON'T BE LATE","Between the sound effects, the solos,the phasing, and the ""colors"" Electric ladyland stands in a class by itself as not only a landmark in Jimi's tragically short but legendary career, but as a landmark in rock as a genre....There has never been a better triple shot of pure power as ""House burning down, into All along the watchtower, and into Voodoo Child slight return"", and the other 13 tracks will do things to your mind you never thought possible, but always wished for.......Listen to this cd with headphones on and volume to 10 so nothing can penetrate through the layers of sonic explosion as they pass through your ears into your very soul......Music is supposed to take you to places never gone to, or to places you never thought existed, well Electric Ladyland does both in vibrant sweeping cascades of vivid color...Rest in Peace Jimi James, we will never let you die.........."
5,hendrix at his finest,"When I bought this album I hadnt much familiarity with Jimi Hendrix as a musician/writer. After listening to EL for the first time, I had no doubt in my mind that we were listening to a modern legend. If you want blues, soul and hard rock, this album fits each bill to a tee. The 15 minute semi live version of Voodoo Chile is a real keeper, and to me carries the entire album. One of the top 10 best rock albums ever."
2,"Wrong Territory, Jimi.","Hendrix is a great guitarist, and as expected, there are some great licks here. However, Electic Ladyland is almost embarrassingly awful in certain songs. Voodoo Chile and Watchtower are among the classics of rock, but a good deal of the balance of the album sounds off-key, is badly sung (especially the backing vocals) and has some weak attempts to be pyschedelic. It comes off as sophomoric at best. It now sounds cheesy and dated. Hendrix is best when he exploits his strengths--straight-forward bluesy rock, augmented by fantastically creative and skillful guitar."
1,True Hendrix,"This is by far the best Jimi Hendrix album, I know people say his first album was better, yeah because of what 4 good songs the rest sometimes could be cared less about but this album on this album there's 6 of Jimi's greatest hits ""Crosstown Traffic"", ""Long Hot Summer Night"", ""Gypsy Eyes"", My favorite ""Burning Of The Midnight Lamp"", the hit ""All Along The Watchtower"" and ""Voodoo Child (Slight Return)"". On top of those hits there is some deep experimentation songs on this album as well with songs like ""1983...(A Mermaid I should Turn To Be), ""Rainy Day, Dream Away"", and ""Still Raining, Still Dreaming"" and of course as some blues on the album with ""Voodoo Chile."". All that is on this album what's there to hate."
1,not that great,"Jimi Hendrix is the king of rock, but this cd just doesn't cut it. It's to soft and mellow. In are you experinced? he was rockin, and so as axis: bold as love. This is a far cry from the best jimi hendrix. If you want some rockin hendrix, get either are you experinced?, or axis: bold as love. Those are the best Jimi Hendrix."
5,Electric Ladyland is where I live,"I am 15, and this is the reason I am a Hendrix fan today. My dad has the original vinyl of this CD and even with the scratches, and pops, this is a very emotional album. It is worth the price tag on it...............as a matter of fact, I just may buy the CD version of it myself!"
5,broadened my musical tastes,"I'm 14 and my tastes in music recently started to expand and I started liking some jazz and blues. My music teacher then let me borrow a CD out of his massive, 1500 Cd collection. It was Jimi Hendrix, Electric Ladyland. I had mostly listened to heavy metal up until then and when I put it in the CD player and listened to all the way through I loved it. Everything about this album is awesome, The guitar solos, The song structuring, the sounds, just everything. This is one my favorite albums ever and is clearly one of the best ever made. My favorites: ...And The Gods Made Love, Crosstown Traffic, Voodoo Chile, Gypsy Eyes, Burning of the Midnight Lamp, Rainy Day, Dream away, All along the Watchtower, and Voodoo Child (Slight Return) where Jimi does some magic with guitar solos and sounds. Buy it, you will not be dissappointed."
5,Still In Complete Awe!,"What more can be said? Of course, this is one of the greatest music recordings of all time...in any genre! When I think of Hendrix it always comes down to his first three albums, ""Are You Experienced?"" ""Axis:Bold As Love"" and ""Electric Ladyland""...It is more like a trilogy than three separate albums. Each stands on its own. Together as a three part entity they are something else entirely. Music just doesn't get any better than this. Not just a one in a lifetime artist but an artist for the ages. If human beings are still on earth a thousand years from now they will be listening to and talking about Jimi Hendrix...with awe and disbelief."
5,Jimi's Opera,"The Jimi Hendrix Experience/ Electric Ladyland: The last `Experience' album is a beautiful experimental album that (with the exception of `Little Miss Strange') has the feel of being Jimi's rock opera. Just about everyone was stunned when this album was released. There was a lot of criticism of the album. It just wasn't what the radio stations, or Rolling Stone Magazine, wanted from Jimi. It took a little time before they came to realize how amazing, and how Great, this double-LP album was. When the greatest guitar player in the world, leading one of the most popular bands of the time, makes a double album of mainly experimental music, he was bound to be criticized. Thankfully, the idea of such criticisms did not stop the band from creating this truly great album and, thankfully, Jimi had become such a big star that the record company allowed him to make the album. A Masterpiece."
5,Amazing...Just Amazing.,"My ""New Favorite"" album, Electric Ladyland is simply stunning. From jazz, to blues, to fleshy rock, this album has it all. My personal favorites are ""1983"" and ""Moon"" (all one song). The songs are epic psychedelic rockers, my favorites, and have a amazing sort of ""eternal"" feeling to them. I also loved the Seagull sounds in Moon, Hendrix doesnt just write songs, he can take us there! Electric Ladyland also represents (in my opinion) the best songwriting Hendrix has ever done. His lyrics are very colorful and abstract, but have a certain truth to them that the listener can only feel. My advice: Buy it, and Love it."
5,MY FAVORITE HENDRIX ALBUM,"Can you imagine, it being 1968 and you throw this album on the turntable? I was 8 in 1968 and this was a little beyond me, but I remember my friends older brother had this and played it when we were around. It was sooooo mysterious and deep with the wildest sounds that I had ever heard. 11 years later, while at The University of Montana, we played the song ""1983"" during a total eclipse of the sun, with the help of some ""stimulants"" we were transported to another world. 37 years later, I still listen to this masterpiece at least twice a month. Only great pieces of music can stand the test of time, and this album my friends, will be played for a very long time to come. If you are young and never have heard this album, buy it immediately, and sit back and enjoy the master at work."
4,real good,"i liked this disc alot but not as much as the first two.Jimi has strong moments such as Little miss strange,crosstown traffic,vodoo chile,&the great remake of Bob Dylan's all along the watchtower which after Jimi did it you forgot about Dylan's version.this is a good solid record."
5,A beautiful album. A MUST-HAVE!,"After I heard this album, I was blown away. Musically, this surpasses Are You Experienced. There is not one bad track on this entire album. ""...And the Gods made love"", ""Moon turn the tides..."" and ""Burning of the Midnight Lamp"" are short, experimental tunes, while ""Voodoo Chile"" and ""1983"" are beautiful flawless epics. Other standout tracks are ""Voodoo Child (Slight Return)"", ""All Along The Watchtower"", ""Crosstown Traffic"" and the Noel Redding penned ""Little Miss Strange"". This should be on everybody's top 10 list of greatest albums. If you do not have this classic album already then waste no more time reading this and go buy it now."
5,"Life wouldn't be the same without, Jimi...",Amazing that you can get this cd. Probably one of the top 5 classic rock and roll masterpieces of all time for under 10 bucks. Time to stock up on stocking stuffers? Nothing to add that these other people have not already.
5,Stunning!,"With fewer of their famous songs than either Are You Experienced? or Axis: Bold as Love, this album somehow surpasses both, in terms of being a complete artistic masterpiece, as well as the album in which Jimi Hendrix really finds his own confidence as a vocalist. But beyond the vocals, The Jimi Hendrix Experience plays some absolutely incredible music on this offering. This album would be worth owning solely for the two epic compositions, ""Voodoo Chile"" and ""1983...(A Merman I Should Be),"" the former being a mindblowing electric blues experience, and the latter showcasing an incredible sense of atmosphere. But beyond those two tracks, this album offers so much more. At 75 minutes, it's a full listening experience, and really takes a listener on a musical journey, from blues to psychadelia, and back. If you bought this album the day after it was released, you still waited too long to add it to your collection!"
5,Quality,"This is just what I was hoping for. Re-Mastered and the sound is excellent. It is as good as the 1st time I heard it on vinyl,"
5,The Best Album or CD I've Ever Heard,"Electric Ladyland is, in my humble opinion, the single greatest recording ever made. 'nough said."
5,Experience the best,"This is my favorite album by Jimi perhaps because of its free flowing, un-restrained, fourteen minuet long, sometimes bluesy, always rockin' songs. This one builds with the heay songs such as Crosstown Traffic and Voodoo Chile, carries through with Come On and Long Hot Summer Night, slows down perfectly with 1983 (A Merman Should I Turn To Be), and ends in the heavy explosin of the entire Experience, in my favorite Jimi song, Voodoo Child (Slight Return). This is a must buy for any music lover."
5,An album that can only be described as genius,"What to say about Jimi Hendrix that hasn't been already said would be near impossible. A guitar god, a lyrical genius, a musician for the ages. But there is one simple thing about ""Electric Ladyland"" that can be said. It allows you to sit back, kick off your shoes, and begin to find yourself in a musical mindstate unparalled by anything else. ""Vodoo Chile"" will hold any rock fan captive in a state of bliss for it's 15 minute length.One has to wonder if Hendrix truley did make this album with the intent to bring musical listeners to heaven and back. If so, mission accomplished.With the release of ""Electric Ladyland"" Hendrix scored his only top 10 hit as well, with a brilliant cover of Bob Dylan's ""All along the watchtower"".Is this the most imporant album The Jimi Hendrix Experience released? That's tough to say, ""Are you experienced?"" and ""Axis..."" were incredible as well. I suppose this is just one of those albums where you must hear it to believe it..."
1,This is a BOOTLEG,"Yes, it looks fantastic. Kudos to the Russian counterfeit art department. But, this is a bootleg, plain and simple, made up to look like a legitimate Japanese import. Some of the tracks were transferred from noisy vinyl. The ""bonus tracks"" are common and available, in better quality, elsewhere. It's interesting that at one time, Soviet Beatle fans would do anything to get the music, even press the tracks onto exposed X-rays. But, now that the Iron Curtain is no more, Russian bootleggers are flooding the market with substandard product. Why is Amazon even selling this crap? Leave that to eBay."
3,nice packaging/poor sound,"you would think that if your going to take the time to package this in a great paper sleeve edition that you would also take the time and make sure you have a great sounding cd. unfortunatly, in this case, they did not. some tracks are in stereo others in mono. at times it sounds like your listening to a worn out vinyl copy with a bad needle to boot. too bad.stick with the past masters vol2 from capital."
5,Hey Jude,"I had this album on vynil when I was young. I searched for it for years as an older adult. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, and for a very good price. I love this music. It's uplifting for me, and it brings back a lot of memories. It is unfortunate that I didn't get the chance to store it in my computer before my move from Florida to Ohio as I seemed to have lost it in the move somehow. At least I got to listen to it once."
3,Hey Jude LP Acetate...Without it's Original Cover???,"I bought this olddie LP for my 13 year old son who is a big fan of the Beatles, unfortunately, what most interested him was the original cover packaging, wich never came. Instead I recived it with a big sign, in other cover package, that said ""Beatles LP inside"". He was very un happy about that. And I was upset because the seller picture at Amazon.com shows the original packing. Thas the only reazon I did not give the seller five stars. I will claim the seller about this issue."
3,Good songs; not a great album,"This is just a collection of singles, not really an album. It doesn't have the great flow of Abbey Road or Sgt Pepper, but if all you want is a few really good songs then this is for you."
3,Okay for a couple of recipes,"This is an okay introduction to the food of New Mexico. However, some of the food just isn't that hot, and I don't mean spicy. I felt like the Feast of Santa Fe was a much better book This is good for some basics like tortillas and sopapillas, but some of the dishes are kind of strange, with hard to procure ingredients."
4,wedding cake cookie cutters,"The cookies were amazing. I really liked using these cutters. They came 5 days earlier which was perfect since I was doing them for bridal shower favors. The only problem I had was that I ordered two of the same size, and when they came in the mail, one was smaller. I had two different size cookies."
4,Eloquent testimony of particpants. Good.,"I liked this book, but it is not as consistently gripping as the author's Pultzer Prize winning history of the Civil War. The book largely consists of eloquent letters from Blacks during this period and McPhearson's commentary.I found the stuggle for civil rights in the North and the evolution of public opinion about emigration as a solution to the problem of free Blacks, fresh and with echoes to our experiences in the world in the 1990's.Despite their individual heroic efforts during the Civil War, was not the Southern cause akin to Nazism in its proximity to evil? As a northern I don't understand this Confederate flag stuff at all.Recently one historian suggested that Missippians also honor the past by honoring the majority of their citizens who actually fought for the north."
5,Totally Unexpected,"At first I thought the movie was way too predictable, but then I thought 'oh there'll be something good at the end' and then I started thinking up some things. Usually I'm right on it, but I did not expect this ending. The ending made the whole movie, not to mention the really, really cute guys, especially****** Spoiler Space***************(characters names from the movie) Wyatt, Mason, and Corey."
2,Not the best of the genre,"This film was ok for what it is, but not DeCoteau's best. Not nearly enough boys-in-boxer-briefs scenes! If you're looking for a flick in the homo-horror genre, definitely get Voodoo Academy (the DVD); it's the best of the lot. Brotherhood 1 and 2 are both okay."
5,Jack Carlisle III - Surprise Ending,"What would have been a typical teen slasher/horror flick has two saving graces: The strong performance by Jack Carlisle III as Perry, who carries the movie, and the twist of an ending still has me surprised."
1,Garbage,"After 10 minutes, of this wannabee it went to the garbage can..so no other can suffer the same fate....which is wastingquality time for a non quality movie."
3,"Mine, All Mine","We are three teachers and a media specialist from a middle school in Utah. We have just read the book Mine, All Mine by Ruth Heller. We believe that the intended audience of this book is middle to high school, while it disguises itself as a children's book. As English teachers we would rate this book five stars in teaching our middle schoolers about uses of pronouns. But if a small child read this book, he or she would not enjoy or understand it. Just from the title, we may not have picked up this book to use in the classroom. Consequently, both audiences might be turned off. We would, however, use this book as a read-aloud with our seventh graders. We feel there is some good information presented in a fun way."
4,artifacts well worth digging for!!!,"This is the first album from this jersey duo that came out in 1994. The album isnt as good as their second album ""thats them"" but theres very little that is. The one thing that is present in both cases is tight flows, smart lyrics and head nodding, hard as hell beats. This time round they are provided by Buckwild (from the diggin'in the crates crew) and T-Ray (from the soul assassin crew), with Redman providing his friends with a nice beat also. The singles that were released from this joint were off the chain ""c'mon with the git down"" which is still an absolute heater after all these years. As is ""dynamite soul"" and the masterpiece ode to graf,(the 1st joint to do so),""wrong side of the tracks"". The rest of this album is so strong that really any track on this could've been singles. Go cop this a.s.a.p. as it really is a diamond of an album."
4,Underground,"East Coast Does it again!!! This is a underground Classic Pure Great Lyrics over a lot of Nitetime Beats Pure sound, you have to get this if you love underground!!!!"
3,The Kingz of Rock,"Tame and El Da Sensai have put down the dope East Coast style since this '94 debut, which is filled with old-school flavored memories and herbed-up battle raps. This album does not grow old and 7 years later it still is one of the top rap albums to come out of Newark, NJ."
2,ok 94' hiphop..,"everything in 94' sounded like this, decent bass beats, usual bragging lyrics, yay,hiphop..."
2,"some good ideas, but author seems to focus on one thing a lot!","Although the author gives good ideas at the end of each chapter in how to beautify a certain area of your home, there seems to be an underlining thought woven throughout much of the book--her divorce. While I have nothing against divorced people (I have some great friends who are divorced), she mentions it so many times through out the book that it makes you wonder if she's ""gotten over it"" or not. Even though she shares lots of experiences to help illustrated her points, some of the ones about her divorce gave it a bad taste to me!"
3,it worked eventually.,THis product was not exactly what i was wanted. I ended up having conversations with the seller about returning. It was going to cost me more to return then to purchase. I needed it reight away so I paid express shipping only to get a piece I was told was the right one. I had conversations with seller and they ended u telling me the piece I needed and i ordered from another company. I ordered an adptor to make use of the part.
5,As promised,Amazon came through and this SONY AC adaptor works exactly as promised. Got it next day and I'm ready to film Thanksgiving weekend. Happy holidays everyone!
1,black and white sketches...,Very disappointed in this book....Black and white sketches in the 21st century don't cut it. I want to see a photo of the plants described. The information provided is good if you live in Florida....but for anywhere else...the recommendations are sketchy. This is the only book from Amazon that i have ever returned.
5,This album truly is an experience,"After being recommended ""Are you experienced?"" several times by my friend (and fellow Amazon reviewer) Andrew, I decided to take his advice and invest in it. The word amazing does not do this album justice, Hendrix was an awe inspiring guitarist/lyricist backed by two musicians of equal talent (Mitch Mitchell on drums & Noel Redding on bass). In all of rocks history not many debut albums can come close to this one, with incredible tracks such as ""Purple Haze"", ""Manic Depression"", ""Fire"" & ""Foxey lady"". You must hear it to believe it, because if you haven't the question still remains, are you experienced?"
1,I dont Like him,"I dont know what everyone is talking about here, I find nothing special in this music.Way Overrated."
1,NOT A METAL ALBUM,"I first picked this album up because I heard Hendrix played some heavy, rockin music. But all this album is is a bunch of blues tunes that go nowhere. His solos are just a bunch of noise and his sound is dated, unlike good bands like Great White and Skid Row. Not recommended for fans of good heavy metal."
1,Greatest guitarist ever?,"I bought this disc based on all the reviews claiming it's the greatest guitar album ever. I was very dissapointed, most of the solos suck. Plus, I was surprised that MTV didnt play any videos from this album, I wonder why? Probebly cause the MTV crowd know this music is tired and boring. If you want great guitar listen to Good Charlotte."
3,blind to truth and justice to the Artist,"american recording industry still does not recognize the fact that this compilation of early hendrix tracks is by no means ""are you experienced"", album that once changed the shape of modern music and guitar playing. and probably the ultimate stupidity of the compiler - omission of the ""red house"" - just shows that hendrix failed in his self-impossed mission to introduce new standards in the american music industry.sad. how sad it is that on amazon.com you can't get the real ""are you experienced"".don't get me wrong, if you can't get british original edition, or any other but this one, this is still one of the best albums in rock'n'roll."
1,Was this mastered from a cassette tape?,"It only makes sense to buy vinyl when it offers better dynamic range and sound quality than the digital alternative. This one doesn't pass that test. The drums are squashed/compressed. The guitars are bright and harsh (think cheap digital EQ). The entire album sounds like it was mastered in a computer from an uploaded cassette tape. The cover looks really nice, and the clean new vinyl begs for another chance on the turntable where it ultimately fails to satisfy each time it's played. If you must have a vinyl copy of this album, hit the garage sales for an original. If you must have the re-issue, I'll sell mine cheap."
5,Awesome!,"This is a classic! If you want to ""experience"" an amazing guitarist listen to Hendrix!!! I highly recommend are you experienced!!! Some of my favorite tracks are:-purple haze-manic depression-hey joe-love or confusion-I don't live today-the wind cries Mary-fire-foxey lady-are you experienced?Go get it!!!"
5,the album that woke up the 60's,"Are You Experienced? is a household name among the greatest albums of all time. Recorded in 1966, it has the unbelievably psychadelic title track, which is a novel of a review in itself. I don't even know where to begin with this song, but can tell you that it's my personal favorite song of all time. The rest of the album consists of various hits that we've come to know over the decades, such as Hey Joe, Purple Haze, The Wind Cries Mary, and Fire. There's so much to love about this album. Bluesy, psychadelic, hard rock, straight rock......it's all here. This album started the acid rock ""movement"" of the mid to late 60's. The Beatles may have had the first quirky material, but James Marshall Hendrix made that type of music bolder and more powerful. 10/10"
3,poor digital recording,"At least 3 of the songs have poorly balanced sound including ""The Wind Cries Mary"" which has only a ghost of the original vocal track."
5,JIMI WAS MAGIC!,"I will say it straight. This is the greatest GUITAR album of alltime PERIOD. And the second greatest ROCK album of alltime only to the Awesome WHO'S NEXT by the Who. Jimi had magic in his playing. Not just fast and searing like todays guitarists play (all the time) But soulful, mystical. And just plain beautiful. Listen to PURPLE HAZE and then MAY THIS BE LOVE. And imagine Eddie Van Halen matching that contrast of power and beauty. This is a seminal ROCK classic. GO GET IT!!!"
4,'Are You Experienced?',"Received in 'as-new' condition and quite promptly. No glitches on either disc.Regarding the discs themselves, the sound of the remastered CD is quite good though (to these ears) not as definitive as it still can be. The DVD is substantial (unlike the Beatles video add-ons) and revealing though the guest commentators and mixers focus on highlight tracks rather than the entire classic slate.The booklet is a great read and rounds off an excellent product offering - 'til the next reissue raises the bar once more:)"
3,"He was a great guitar player, BUT....","Jimi Hendrix was probebly the best guitarist that ever lived in the 60s. However, his songwriting talent is medicore. I understand how many people give this album 5 star reviews because of his undeniable guitar playing skills but being a great guitar player isnt what makes an album, you also need great songwriting skills, in which Jimi Hendrix seriously lacks. Are You Experienced? was the most groundbreaking guitar album ever released by any band or artist, I fully recommend it but dont expect anything great from the songwriting area."
4,Jimi Hendrix Experience,"Am I the only person who noticed that ""All Along the Watchtower"" is missing from this historic recording????"
5,but only ONE STAR for the mastering,"I don't understand this. Surely this classic album is long overdue for a proper remastering job.With all the hacking around that's been done with Hendrix's catalog over the years, are the master tapes now permanently screwed up?I have this album on vinyl (UK mono release) and the sound it superb. No fake stereo, for one thing.The worst culprit on CD is the almost unlistenable 'Can You See Me?', a brilliant, brilliant song all but destroyed; just listen to that crackling in the intro, not to mention the overall 'deadened' sound, which I understand is due to clipping and caused by an attempt to make the CD as 'loud' as possible.For now, I'll stick to listening to the tape I made from my vinyl copy."
5,This album will expand your mind,"I hate people that say, ""Hendrix wasn't a good guitar player, my friend can play his stuff."" (Or something similar.) The thing was that JH was much more than a great guitar player, he was also an amazing song writer; and song writing and guitar playing are totally different. You can feel his emotions on this album without listening to the words being sung. It's like the music is playing him in a way. Most of my friends prefer ""Electric Ladyland"" to this album, but I think this has sort of a ""heavier"" sound to it, which is what I prefer. I would also recommend this if you are new to Hendrix. If you are a guitar player, they also sell the transcribed score book if you're up for a challenge and want to play along."
5,Jimi was ahead of his time. Worlds greatest guitarist.,"This album is not only a masterpiece, It also is a cornerstone of American culture as a whole. Jimi defined alot of things for us all. Just Beautiful..."
2,Poor Sound and Imaging,"I only had to listen to one song and it just sounded wrong! The digital influence is screamingly blatant or else someone just didnt know what they were doing in the analog realm. At each wave of music you can hear some type of filter squeezing the sound inward almost like some type of weird dolby, but worse. This is the opposite of what you are looking for if you are buying vinyl. Some background noise would be more welcome than sepnding $25 for a degradable digital version of this classic. I mean someone might not ""get it"" if they hear an off version the first time. I think I may be done with these reissues."
2,Impossible to listen to straight,"This was Hendrix's best album, and it has a couple good moments on it, but it's really not worth the effort. He was a technical genius, without a doubt, but he was neither a song writer, nor a band leader. Maybe if he had gotten off the drugs, he could have lead a great jazz band, like Miles Davis did. We'll never know."
3,Hes good but hes no Kurt Cobain,"Yeah jimi might have been talented but was he anywhere close to the greatness of Kurt Cobain? I think not. Other than a couple catchy hits, he was just an average guitar player. He's weak by today's standards. For good guitar work Check out ""Nevermind"" or ""Bleach"". Long Live Nirvana"
2,Not As Good As Ya Might Think,"Everybody goes ""Ooh, Jimi Hendrix"" just because he died. I don't think his music is particularly good. In fact, some of it stinks!!! And, I'm sick and tired of people calling hard rock or metal. HE IS NOT!!! Why can't people get used to that fact. He's just really soul with some rock influnces. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but I'm tired of seeing heavy metal lists with him in them. Some of the songs on this album are okay, like 'Purple Haze' and 'Fire', but a lot of them are not really rock at all. Psychedelic trash, some of it is."
1,Guitar hero? More like guitar ZERO!,"Words cannot describe my intense dislike for Jimi's guitar ""skills"". This guy is a HACK. All songs sound exactly the same, the drummer is weak, does the bassist even exist? Listen to some REAL music that actually requires talent- like Nickelback!"
5,everlasting classic,"I first bought this record when it came out in, what 1967 or 68. I still have it. I got it on CD, it was stolen, I went out and bought it again.I never tire of it, and really think it's JH's best. Later pieces are slightly too far from classic Blues for me, but these numbers are fantastic, and there are an incredible number of fantastic numbers. On that same trip to the US, I brought back This record, the Door's strange days, and Janis joplin's big brother. I still listen to them, 35 years later, about once a week (now on the ipod...), or when I want to get back to old friends. With a good fire in the fireplace, a good glass of armagnac, what more do you want?For more details, read the other reviews (the good ones).Better still go out and get this record."
5,Are You Experienced With Rocks Greatest Album,"This is one of the greatest rock n roll albums that ever lived. Are You Experienced changed the face of rock n roll in 67. If you are a guitarist, classic rock fan, or just a begginger buy Are You Experienced for these reasons.1. This Is The Greatest Rock N Roll Album In History.2. It includes extra songs that were not included on the orginal album.3. It is Experience Hendrix the hendrix company that included the whole album Remastered.I recomend this album 100% if you dont got The Jimi Hendrix Experience Are You Experienced your missing out. The music on here is out of sight dont miss out stand next to rocks greatest album Are You Experienced. Please Feel Free To Pick Up The Guitar And Rock."
3,A great yet overhyped classic,"This is a good album but not the masterpiece that everyone here is raving about. First, what's up with the bonus tracks?? I hate it when a record company add bonus track to an already ""classic"" album. But, This is definitly Jimi's best album."
2,snore.,"this record is the pits.... three piece band..... could have been fleshed out with some hotly clad female singers and, ya know, i saw some old footage of these guys at some rock festival from, i dunno, 1958 or something.... there is not a cool gang hand signal to be seen and the main guy is black!!!.... there is this weird, i dunno, interplay between the musicians.... there is a lack of any throbbing sterile rhythm track.... the guitar player isn't even doing any strumming, hardly!!.... this music makes me feel weird and almost kept me from staring into my IPhone continuously... in our new world order this sort of soulful mind expanding crap won't be allowed if i have my way.... i'd avoid this recording unless you want to revisit a lost era of creativity and hope... why would anyone want to do that!? they didn't even have many coffee bars back then!! and the winters back then were FREEZING!! yuck! now excuse me while i get back to my AMERICAN IDOL SHOW!!!"
2,"Effects, effects, effects","Jimi Hendrix! The guitar god! What a sham. Yes,Jimi Hendrix was one of the greatest guitarest that ever lived, but he wasn't a guitar revolutionary he was an effects revolutionary. He made the guitar sound weird with a wah-wah and fuzz, what's the big deal. To me this whole album is a jam using new ""techniques"" to ad an edge and that's it an edge. I'll admit many numbers get me going, but this album is no different from any other Moby Grape or Stepenwolf (not to say these bands are bad). By far though, the worst thing on this album are the lyrics, they're senseless readings of psychelic words and discriptions of drug trips. In fact I think the most revolutionary thing about this album is Mitch Mitchel's druming. I'm not saying the album is bad it's actually very good it's just one of the most over-rated albums ever."
5,The Best,"This album is essential for any rock music fan. This is my favorite Hendrix album, it's great from the first song to the last.In my younger days of learning the guitar, I wore out this album listening and learning every song. The sound quality is good and the songs are even better.Highly recommended!"
5,explosive debut,"Jimi Hendrix was without category.you can't define his genius any one style of music he was all kinds of music all at once.this debut is very explosive.lets be real most first albums aren't that great less more classics.but as usual with Jimi he breaks the norm.starting out with Purple Haze,Hey Joe,Foxey Lady,The wind cries mary.what a diverse mix of music? Jimi was always ahead of the curve and this disc shows why.this disc showcases why he is one of the greatest musical forces the world has ever known."
5,the worlds best CD,This is the best CD ever made so good in fact it could only be made by the god JIMI HENDRIX!!!!!!!! It is perfect in ever way!!!
2,Disappointed,Crochet Gifts To Go!Was disappointed. May be okay for a new crocheter but there were not many patterns I would use. Wish I would not have wasted my money. Could have found patterns online for free that were better.
1,weird headphone connector,"what is the point of making an mp3 player with some weird headphone connector that is unlike any connector on any other piece of equipment, and only fits the headphones that camne wiht the machine? manufacturers as stupid as this deserve to be boycotted for all time."
1,Pretty Bad,"This camara looks cool, but it only took something like 10 pictures and it was full. The pictures would not load because there was something wrong with the software, try a better camara if you can."
2,Why,"I had a major problem with getting the pictures on the computer. It was either hit or miss. I'd check the USB connection over and over again, it kept saying it coulnd't find the camera and stuff. The 8mb fit one song on it, which doesn't help working out or walking so I would have to shell out for a 64 compact flash card, plus the pictures really weren't that clear. The real problem was the slowness of taking the picture to register as being taken, and the batteries were gone each time I used it. Not a good choice."
4,spice racks,I love how long these spice racks are. They fit perfectly above my stove. They are a bit wider than I thought they would be away from the wall but still work in giving me more space in my cabinets in my very small kitchen. I gave it four stars because if you want these to stay clean you will need to spray protector stuff on them so the wood wont soak-in grease from cooking.
1,Rip Off on price but good product,These are a great product but as others are saying they are just 3.99 at IKEA or you can even make it yourself.
5,Authoritatively rocking,"(...) yes, this album is more energetic and eclectic then their other releases, but it works for me. Okay, I can hear the influence of Heroic Doses and 5style, but it seems that they take the best elements of those bands and combine it with their previous somber and moody style. Jacobsen's tube-saturated, imaginative guitar lines, Rapsys's aggresive, uninhibited drumming and Macri's melodic, in-the-pocket basslines combine for a cool cocktail that goes down like a Mint Julep on a hot day. Whether it's a latin, funk, post-rock or dub groove, these boys succesfully avoid cliches and labels.Now if they would only tour the east coast more often...."
2,Not for me.,"Euphone really disappointed me with this one. I have their previous three albums, and they really changed direction with this one. It seems that everything I liked about Euphone is gone. They used to be mostly mellow, and somewhat Tortoise-y (yes I know, every reviewer of them makes note of this, but -- that's because it's true!). This album sounds erratic, and not in a really good way. It seems that they have taken the haywire guitar sounds of 5ive style and Heroic Doses and tried to mix it in with their sound. Just didn't work for me.I much prefer ""The Calendar of Unlucky Days"" to ""Hashin it Out""."
4,Great strings for fingerstyle playing,"I love these strings and have used them for many years now. I find they are a nice balance between brightness, softness, and tensile strength for someone who must frequently change tunings. They certainly don't last forever, but that extra bit of softness is great for my playing, anyway.Don't try to tune up *too* high; the 3rd and 4th strings are most risky in this regard. You can't take the 4th 'D' string up to 'E' repeatedly without risking breakage; and I would never tune the 3rd 'G' up any farther. As others have noted, open 'E' tunings are basically out of the question."
1,dont buy if u like tuning to a higher step than E,big fan of the brand but can't seem to tune to open E without breaking G (3rd string) all though the strings seem to be designed for a more mellow tune according to the decription from reviews. buyer be beware!
3,"More, please.","There are some real winners on this collection, but it seems that someone didn't do their research when putting it together. It's a little too jumbled; if you're a big enough fan to buy a box of rarities, you already know all the album versions presented on this collection. And likely you've heard much of the other stuff (Atilla and the Hassles have been floating around on CD's for a long time now). Lots of other alternate takes and unreleased songs probably exist from the 70's and 80's, and IMHO that is really what the fans are seeking. Where was ""Handball?"""
4,Very Good Box set,"this Box set is very Good&would have been better with more rare stuff to offer. this is a Artist who made his mark with His Vocals&Songwriting that has Produced some timeless material. you really appreciate His Best stuff from the 70's. by the 80's He settled for alot of 50's to early 60's sounding style Pop which fit his style,but also down-played the aggressive edge that alot of his 70's material had. I enjoy the rare tracks&the Dvd.was hoping for more rare stuff though. His Songwriting reflected his enviroment&challenged the ears. He is your typical Mood swing Artist. I always admired His Hybrid ability at blending styles&making things work for him.if a Cat like Ben folds stays motivated,jaded&Hungry then He could end up with a Billy Joel type of Career&Run. Billy Joel Musically is like a Cross between the Streets&Broadway&Yet He made it all work as one."
2,Money or Love,"I'll keep it brief, the demos are not complete songs and are annoying. I would rather have heard live tracks than this.And some songs are just album versons HUH??? What the hell was he thinking? This is a negative 5 stars compared to Tracks by Springsteen. The only song that is complete and is really excellentis money or love on disc 2. So you have to ask yourself with this boxset did Billy do it for Money or Love?"
1,Could have been better,"My wife and I are big Joel fans and have all of his albums but, unfortunately, this is not to be compared with the ""Beatles Anthology"" discs. Inserting interviews in-between the unreleased tracks, and old low quality recordings, explaining the music would have at least helped me associate some with the songs. Instead, it's just one bad song, or old recording, after another with no real explanation of what it is. Don't expect any hidden unreleased treasures; we managed to listen to at least 3 out of the 4 cd's, but neither of us will likely listen to them again.As I said, we're big Joel fans and I figured, after reading some bad reviews from other fans, that ""they just don't understand the point of the cd's"" and I purchased it anyway.As for the concert DVD, his voice sounds awesome . . . but it's a concert from '95, with only around 8 songs, and most of them were his newer releases.Oh well, at least I didn't pay a fortune."
3,Underwhelming,"The stuff on this box set meets neither of the criteria that should be exercised when compiling such a set. For the most part it is neither:a) particularly excellent - this, with a few exceptions, doesn't represent his catchiest, chart-topping best, and if that isn't the raison d'etre for BJ, I don't know what is...nor is itb) particularly interesting - in fact, it's kinda boring. The most noteworthy material here is the covers, but they're all, truthfully, notably inferior to the originals.I guess I just don't have the requisite Billy Joel love...."
2,Not so great...,I was disappointed. The demos are annoying. Very choppy. I am a HUGE Billy Joel fan and this set just didn't do anything for me.
4,TRACK LISTING,1. Paying The Price Of Love (Album Version) 4:132. Paying The Price Of Love (Jellybean Mix #1 Edit) 4:083. Paying The Price Of Love (Jellybean Mix #1) 6:104. Paying The Price Of Love (The Ocean Drive Mix) 6:135. Decadance (Classic House Mix) 8:45
4,Nearly 30 Minutes of Dance Music!,"This is one of the lengthier and more extensive extended CD-singles the Bee Gees have ever done. Only the ""ESP"" remixes from 1987 are better and that is very hard to find. However, other than the single mix that did poorly on the charts, the rest of the ""Paying The Price Of Love"" remixes are high-tech synthesized drums and jazzy piano inventions. Its good if you are into that kind of interpretation. My feeling is that the only reason to own this 1993 single is for the 8:45 minute version called ""Decadance' (""You Should Be Dancing"")."
1,Not worth the money,We'd bought this for our stroller that the car seat attaches to as it has no additional shade provided. Wished we hadn't wasted the money for this as it's not very durable and it's limited in what bars it can be placed on the baby's stroller given the attachment and it really doesn't provide the shade we'd hoped. Disappointing.
1,Pass on this one,Too difficult to use.Pain to fold the stroller.Annoying trying to get the right angles to be useful.Broke after a few weeks.
1,Does Not Attach to My Gracco Stroller,I have a Gracco stroller and this umbrella does not fit on it...I've bought it and could never use it! Sad...
1,Breaks too Easily!,I have purchased eight Tracy Porter pieces and they are quite lovely.Problem is....five of the eight pieces arrived broken.The china is poorly made and simply not strong or durable enough to use.You can literally break the pottery in your hand.It's a shame because the pattern is bright and pretty.
3,Don't go all in yet,"I thinks this book is not for begginers the author I assume a lot of knowledge and experience from the readers. But if you are an advance player well... then the book will not teach you much.If you are an intermediate poker player willing to invest some money on the tables trying to understand what Ciaffone is trying to tell you, well I think this is your book... I think he is teaching the right way to play but only experience and practice can help you understand what he is trying to say."
4,A must-read for farm boys & farmboy wannabees.,"If you, like me, grew up on a ""real"" farm in the Upper Midwest, this book will take you back to the sights, sounds, smells and memories of your childhood. You'll smile, nod your head in agreement, and sometimes even cry. You'll read paragraphs aloud to your wife who did not grow up on farm, and she'll say ""that's nice"" but not quite get it. If you did not grow up on a farm, and would like a better understanding of farm boys, this is a must read. I'll read it again."
4,Been to a KD show? This will make you wish you had.,"Man...this album rules. If you never got a chance to see this band live (I didn't), don't buy this record because it'll make you kick yourself for not ever going to one of their shows. I can't really compare ""Shorter Faster Louder"" with the first release because they are both so good, and similar. A lot of the songs are short and fast (no suprise) and are over in less than a minute. There's one cover (try to figure the words out; impossible) and a few guest singers. I was suprised at the political content of a few songs from such a fun band. I mean nothing too deep, but they touch on a few issues like police brutality. If you like the frist album and the split with 88FL then you should definately pick this up. If it took reading this review to convince you of that, something's wrong. Late."
4,What Avail would sound like if they didn't suck.,"Very cool stuff. Goes from rippin' 80's hardcore to more poppy-sounds in a blink of an eye, but without sounding either sugary or overly tough. Also, it may be noted that these guys could be serious contenders along with A.C and Zeke in a short-song competition: these 18 songs clock in at just under 25 minutes."
3,Leaked after 10 months,"I placed this product in service on Jan 2011. By November of 2011 (10 months of service), the leak from hot water faucet was so bad, we had to turn off the valve to it. I called factory, and they could promise the replacement part in 3 weeks delivery time. I am still waiting for the part. The product looks good, but since it does not do its primary job (delivering water only when needed), and factory does not appear surprised at the low quality of their part (I was expecting a representative to show up to see why the product quality issues), I will give it a 2. I cannot see myself buying this faucet and perhaps brand again.Update: Based on good customer service, I am upgrading to a 3 star."
5,Great Product,Very sturdy. My plumber was very impressed when he installed it. The sprayer attachment seems sturdier than others I've had.It looks great with my double stainless steel sink.
4,Sail Power,"Very good resource for the dynamics of wind power, sail design and proper use, but I expected a little more about the true basics like hardware, vessel design and derminology."
5,What a rip off,"I love the item, I hate the price. What a joke. You can buy each season at Wal-Mart for $19.96. That comes to $179.64 for the 9 seasons. Unreal. That is almost $100.00.I am shocked. I usually can't say enough good things about Amazon. But this one is bad."
1,what I got was not what was shown,"I love frasier ! When I saw this listing i thought how convienient ! It looked like all seasons were individually bought so you would get the little booklet with each dvd as to the names of all the eppisodes and a little blurb about all ! Well i got all the dvds in what looks like a cd book just all the disks in that i could flip page by page with disks , no book with the eppisodes , not cases for each season ..... im very very upset and the photo shown here is very descieving !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! does anyone know if i can return to sender ?????????"
4,One of the first...,"I hear that the Jensen book is very similar... But, until I read it I'll keep my trap shut... This is a very good book at providing some of the foundations for how many comp. chem. methods function. Gives a good overview for almost all methods, but some newer concepts (which weren't exactly developed at the time) are a bit sparser... The math isn't overly daunting if you can follow most QMech stuff, and he provides many many references in case you do get stuck... Overall, good, but perhaps needs to be overhauled for the next generation of comp. chem."
4,Beautful watch that didn't work,"I ordered this watch as a Christmas gift for my husbad. It is beautiful, and I especially like the automatic self winding function. Unfortunately, the date and time could not be set and I had to return the watch."
1,Disapointment,Got the watch and as one other person reviewed cannot set the day or the date. Seems to be a pattern not an remote glich. I would have thought better of an Accutron with a 7750 movement. Returned it.
1,Didn't find the book worth the read!,"It bothers me that the author took 276 pages to tell the same story over and over again. A man is accused of killing two wives. The bodies haven't been found. Still, a trial is held and the defendant is found guilty.This could have been written in 50-75 pages, instead of rehashing the same events to the point of boredom.The book does have one redeeming line on page 270, ""There really are monsters out there."" Monsters is the key word. They can be any sex, any race, any age, any occupation, any religion. This is the author's greatest message to the readers of this book."
5,Gruesome but great,"This book tells an almost unbelievable tale of a very twisted man. The details on occasions are graphic but this makes for an even more compelling read. A really great read for any true crime lovers, I couldn't put it down..."
1,Don't Buy This Book...Total waste of money and time!!!,Because this book has been out of print people have resold it for $25 - $60 dollars. First it is very short and other than no plot the romance and sex is bad. Go buy a $5.00 Harliquin book instead. I spent $30 for my copy and would gladly give it away...could not have been more unhappy with a book.
2,Not Worth the Expense,"As a Family Phyisician, I found nothing new in the book that I hadn't learned in my Human Resources classes in my undergrad years. Does not impart any new ""trust"" wisdom. My prescription for you is to save your money and spend it elsewhere. I was disappointed in terms of bang for the buck. To little bang. Too much buck."
2,Absolutely elementary,"The CDs in this package are very easy to follow, but the knowledge you gain is very elementary. At the end you have just learned a few phrases. Too expensive for the result."
2,"Don""t buy","I learned this whole series and then traveled to Ukraine, after which I realized only some of the words are pronounced right, though it was somewhat funny when I spoke as these native speakers did the people laughed at me, It will teach you to say thank you but not you are welcome. and thank you is not even close to how it is really pronounced"
1,A very poor product,"I am a native English speaker, now living in Ukraine, and so have ordered 3 different teach-yourself audio sets to learn Russian. The Pimsleur set is far and away the worst. As another reviewer has already commented, the conversation never advances beyond the first converstaion, about whether you are American and whether you speak Russian. Other CDs cover this in the first dialogue. Also unacceptable that there is no written book or pamphlet accompanying, since you have a new alphabet to learn.I was surprised by the bad quality, because I was quite satisfied with the Pimsleur-Albanian, which I used previously.I think the best Russian set I bought was the book and 2-CD set called ""Teach Yourself Russian."" The book is so helpful that I am now using it in class with my Russian teacher. Also good is ""Learn Russian in Your Car,"" although it spends more time on vocabulary, and less on dialogue."
4,Four stars for what it is... Hear me out on this one!!!! :),"Okay... this movie is as corny as they get. The dialogue is pretty darned stilted at points... In fact, it looks like some college buddies got together and put an action movie together... every CIA/Action/War cliche in the world is thrown in to this movie...BUT - The actors don't appear to be taking themselves to seriously, the girls are cute, the action is not all that bad, and the stunts are to die for. Especially the guy who falls off the guard tower because the truck busts through the gate... This is a good cigars on the back porch kinda movie... not heavy, not preachy... doesn't matter if you take a phone call or go to the bathroom kinda movie. And we all need that once in a while! Just my humble opinion... Enjoy! (Just don't buy it at full price :))"
3,"It sounds GREAT with the mallet, but terrible is just using your hand.","The quality was great, and the sound quality was great when I used the mallet. But I teach a music class for ages 0-4, and the younger children often do not use the mallet. Unfortunately, when using your had there is practically no sound. Looking for something else before I decide if I will return them."
5,Speaking the truth in love,This book is inspirational and empowering. The author shares her experience and insights with clarity and empathy for her readers. A very present help in times of trouble.
4,Like it,"The quality is so so, pages are looser and turn to yellow color .Few hand cards in it...But it also useful !"
3,"Unit Operations and Processes in Environmental Engineering, Second Edition",It is a rather complete book on the subject. Its content is appropriate for an undergraduate course in Environmental Engineering. It has one important deficit: most of the mathematical equations are not fully derived and the student will have to resort to other books to have a better understanding of what she/he is applying in solving a problem.
2,"Lacks Explanations for Many Problems, Lots of Typoes and Incorrect Information","This is possibly one of the worst texts I have ever used. Many of the example problems contain typos or diagrams that do not match the given problem. Numbers are often pulled out of thin air without explanation. Many of the ""answers"" in the back of the text are incorrect. Some chapter problems cover material not covered in the chapters. Additionally, the solutions provided by the publisher are often incorrect. This textbook needs a significant overhaul before it can be considered appropriate for use in undergraduate or graduate programs!!"
5,This does not fit a 2007 Volvo XC90 with V8 engine,This does not fit a 2007 Volvo XC90 with V8 engine. The filter itself looks to be a good filter.
5,Quick and Perfect condition,"This is a book written by a friend of mine that I was really excited to buy. I purchased this used copy, which came quickly and in perfect condition. It is signed and waiting to be read now that the cold winter months are upon us."
2,Interesting yet limited,"Brooke's experience with Sai Baba, as related in ""Lord of the Air"" certainly make for interesting reading yet lacks an ""Occam's Razor"" approach when describing the alleged miracles of the Indian Super guru. All of the ""miracles"" of Sai Baba are uncritically described as the result of demonic power. Yet each and every one of Sai Baba's miracles are reproducable by any number of professional stage magicians. While I am pleased Mr. Brooke left the cult, I fear he exhibits an entirely too naive view of alleged occult power. Baba is nothing more than a con artist, plain and simple. That alone should warn people off."
5,Great heavyweight!,I have baked quiche to scones in these pans and no matter what I bake everything just slips right out. No fighting with knives digging along the sides to release my goodies from the pan. I flip the pan over and out it comes the food.
4,excelente for administering and manager SQL 6.5,"great book for administering, understanding the SQl 6.5"
3,Covered a range of topics but with many mistakes,"This was a great book because it covered a range of topics that in many other books I read were ignored. However there were many typos and mistakes in the code. All in all worth buying, it helped me a great deal with preparing for my certification."
4,Best Ferrari Toy Car Ever,"We bought this for our son when he was going through his Ferrari phase. He still has it, and it has weathered hours of fun. It's very well made and worth the price for die-hard Ferrari fans."
4,Remote Car Review,"My husband loves it, our dogs, not so much. It's fast, pretty, and keeps my 3 year old busy trying to figure out how to steer it. Great for an older child or one young at heart."
1,Total Crap,"The worst aspect of this film is Scott Anthony Leet, I actually googled him to see if was a real actor or maybe just a friend of the director. He has two modes:1. happy excited best bud: ""hey I bet I can wolf my burger faster than yours!""2. instant channel change to crazy-eyed killer: ""what do you MEAN you don't like pickles...""Just look at the DVD picture, that's how he looks in mode 2.Also, wasn't Bonin a homosexual who raped young men and killed them? I guess that was too much research to do for the screenwriter."
5,Will keep you coming back again and again!!!,The story is enchanting. I coudn't put it down! You can really imagine yourself being there and living their experience. The story line is captivating. After I finished reading Ballet Shoes I had to run out and buy Dancing Shoes too! The first time I read this book I finished it in 2 days because I couldn't stop reading it. I highly reccomend this book to those who enjoy good reading that will bring you lots of fun and entertainment. I would read this book over and over again if only I had the time.
3,Fondly remembered,"I haven't read this book in years. I was thrilled, however, when Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan in You've Got Mail) identifies the ""Shoes"" books for a customer and adds that Ballet Shoes was her favorite. It was mine, too--in fact, I was so enthralled with it that I really couldn't get into the others.I'm sure that if I re-read it now, I would find it both dated and unrealistic. As a child, though, I enjoyed it thoroughly. It can't possibly be for everyone, but I'd bet that young girls who love ballet (and I was one) will still enjoy this book today."
2,Micaela's thoughts,I think this book was okay. I think it should have been more interesting and exciting. I recommend this book to people that like ballet
1,the worst book I've ever read in my life!,This book is very confusing and mis leading. The author first went wrong with charicters with names like underware or perfume brands enough said. Please consider this reveiw and buy a different book please the last thing this book needs is five stars. :( ;( 8(
5,A childhood classic.,"Every girl--or boy for that matter-- MUST read this book. It's touching, funny, and human. And it discusses all the things that make little girls starry -eyed. I started reading the ""SHOES"" series when I was 10. I'm 26 now and I still own them, tattered as they are. A must read."
4,Where oh where are the Rest?,"There are many good books for girls out now but that doesn't mean that bookstores need to banish older books to the ether. I loved Ballet Shoes and am trying to find "" Traveling Shoes""...some of the detail is a little dated but that is part of the charm of the books. They are WORTH READING and they are fun to read. I hope whichever company has the publishing rights will reprint ALL of them and illustrate them well ( matching hair color etc.)"
4,Ballet shoes review.,"My grandaughter and I are reading it together. It has some substance, great for a change!"
1,Same thing... over and over,This author should have stoped writing this book on page 18. At this point he had already covered everything several times. Makes me think i could write a book so long as i went over the same stuff over and over.
5,Christmas Gift,Mom wanted one of each flavor! We used to make syrup when I was a kid! Very nice to have for when I visit!
3,"Not ""Live and Dangerous""","I was a little disappointed with this one. Sound is pretty ruff. I dig Phil to pieces so I had to give it a try. There is a song that was left off (Called ""One Wish""- actually it was redone and called Harlem on this disc)that I would have liked to see that on the list. Still, Phil not quite at his best, is better than most."
4,Unique...,"Mr. Vertigo was very well written, the story was unique and the characters are colorful. The build up of the story was very well put together, but at the end I did have to wonder what all the fuss was about. The final 3rd of the book when the focus was on Walt as an adult was such a huge switch from the first half that it was difficult to adjust to and keep up with. In the same respect the concept of this book is so ""out there"" that the pages keep on turning... It certianly is worth reading, but you have to concentrate."
2,A Literary Mess - An English Professor's Dream,"This book is well written in many ways, but it is a literary mess. I kept waiting for the story to chose a direction and stick with it, but it never does. Rather, it goes in four or five different directions. The language is overly course, even for someone like myself who has uttered a few choice phrases in his life. It reminded me of several books that I read as an undergraduate in college, the likes of which that a professor or TA would go crazy over-analyizing, pointing out every possible metaphor, analogy, etc. This is not to say that the book is horrible. It does have moments, and it can be enjoyable in parts, but it would be difficult to go out of my way to recommend it."
1,This book was AWFUL,"As a student, I can't stand reading during the summer, but you always wish for a book that will really knock the socks off of you.This book, however, turned me off all together...First of all, how am I supposed to relate to this book at all? I cannot relate to a kid who can fly!! First of all there is fantasy, and then there is complete nonsense. This book is the sencond of the two.Not only that I certainly did not enjoy the entire chapters on masturbation and sex. It's disturbing and disgusting.All in all...this book was RIDICULOUSLY GOD-AWFUL in all ways possible. I don't know you Paul Auster, but by reading this one terrible book of yours, I do not even WANT to know you, nor do I want to read another one of your sick books."
3,Outstanding attention to details pulls story out of depths.,"This novel is by no means a return to form; the storyline, characterization, and dialog is mediocre atthe very best. What saves this work is an exceptional eye for detail; the book is rich with description and place. Take, for example, the detailed rise to fame of the protagonist. All the performances described are elegantly detailed and, as a result, tremendously entertaining. This is one major consistancy with the novel. Another consistency is the admirable philosophy that fills the pages (especially toward the conclusion). Auster has an incredible ability to distill simple actions down to the most revealing minimum. If only the storylines of his novels were as good as the writing. If only Attention to minute detail aside, ""Mr. Vertigo"" suffers from being merely good."
2,Lost It's Flight of Fancy,"Somewhere along the way I got the feeling that Auster either got bored of Walt, his main character, or forgot how to fly. This story, which at times had been recalling John Berger's wild tale, ""Little Big Man,"" lost its air and just flittered away. Disappointing wrap-up left me empty."
2,Another Tricky Romance Author,"I'm not enjoying all the Romance authors who have now decided to write Mystery/Thriller novels. I'm all for character development and relationships between characters. It's not really the romance that bothers me. I just don't think Romance authors write as well as TRUE mystery writers. Unfortunately this is yet another example of a Romance novel disguised as a Mystery. It does have the crime/mystery aspect, but also screams ROMANCE. Not my cup of tea!"
4,Great,I wasn't sure that I would enjoy this story. I was pleasantly surprised. Great read. Would definitely recommend it. Must read.
3,Good pageturner,"This book was ok - ok enough to make me buy the others! If you need an easy and pleasant read, this book will do it."
3,Good story.,"I enjoyed the book a lot. It is a well-written book, the characters are well developed and the story flows beautifully.I was sure I would see more conflict from the Senator's family, and I was left wanted more.Thanks for sharing your story with us."
5,A very good story about opposites attract...,This book is a very good example of how opposites attract. It shows that no matter how different you think you are there is always common ground somewhere. It started out kind of slow for me but that really is the only negative thing I can say about it. I really enjoyed the whole thing. It had me on the edge of my seat.
5,"Someone to Believe in, Close to You and Taking the Heat","This trilogy was a heartwarming look into a family whose love for each other was both humorous and sometimes annoying and interfering. The three stories were novels that stood well by themselves and were in the vein of a Nora Roberts or Fern Micheals book. It had trials, love lost, hardships to overcome and finally a happy ending although not without hard work and compromise. It had suspense and surprises. After reading the first on Kindle I went back and immediately bought the other two and finished those right away and added them to my favorites. The Author is now someone to watch for,read and reread down the road."
2,Kind of disappointing...,"I was looking forward to listening to the full length album after catching the band live last year. Unfortunately, the record does not seem to catch the raw energy of the live show. The music on the record comes off sounding like outdated 1980's alternative pop. Hopefully the band might consider releasing a live album in the near future. I'm not giving up on them though."
1,very very bad,Listening to Nancy Sirianni's voice is like listening to nails on a chalkboard. Her voice is very weak and she doesn't have a good range. The songs aren't very catchy and they lack decent hooks. I don't recommend wasting any money on this album.
3,Just a bit too small,"I wanted something small, but this is too small. The plan was to use it as an everyday purse, but it wouldn't hold my stuff and my iPad mini. Needs to be maybe an inch deeper and a couple inches taller."
5,Very Cute,"I bought this mini backpack because I hate carrying purses, its really tiny, but it holds a good amount of stuff in it. I carry my wallet, keys, cellphone, make up bag and a book all at the same time and they all fit well. It's so light you sometimes forget its on your back. I really love i!"
3,It's okay!!,"I do like this item, however it is too thin and wasn't what i quite expected. It still came in use. It is small and only has two compartments in it."
3,Cute,"Cute mini-backpack, perfect size to use in place of a handbag.However, i wish the straps were padded."
2,Too Small!,The description says it's good for small framed people. I'm short and only require 1 or 2 books at a time in school. This thing is MINI. I cannot fit a regular textbook in here let alone wear it. Returned!
1,"This item, sucks.","So I bought this item, not knowing the actual size of the backpack. So before i bought the backack i called amazon and asked about it. The man clearly explained that it was a NORMAL sized backpack. So i get the package, late. But no big deal.. I open it up. If you dont know what size it is either, let me tell you. Its about 9.5 inches tall, 6 inches wide. This is smaller than the backpack you'd see a toddler carrying around. Keep in mind that it was 24 dollars. I called amazon asked for a redund,Sent the package. No refund adter 6 weeks.Happy shopping."
2,Thought it was bigger,Just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use..
2,The picture and description didn't match.,"I clicked on a picture of an all black bag and all it said was ""black"". When I received it, it had skulls and roses on it and the description on the invoice said that this was what I ordered. I went back in to see if I had made an error. I went up to the point of checkout and it automatically switches it from solid black to the bag with skulls! Be careful when you order, double-check the description before clicking checkout. The picture shows a solid black bag."
4,Backpack,"Great backpack. Nice and compact and durable. Fast shipping. Would have liked to have seen better dimensions on website, their lack of sizing made it that I had to guess and it was smaller than I expected. But on the whole happy."
5,Perfect size for daily excursions,"I wanted something small and light for my short trips to grocery store, library, walking. It is perfect to carry water bottles, camera, etc for short day hikes, or to handle a half gallon milk container from a grocery store walk. Mostly used for library runs for DVDS and a few books. I sprayed it with a water repellant first thing and it has been able to keep items dry even on the wettest days.Well constructed, seams are strong. Arm straps are the same type strapping as large backpacks, but without padding. Padding isn't needed for the small amount of items being carried anyway.I think this is the perfect solution for size, strength, appearance, and comfort over options of full size backpacks or back sacks."
2,Not happy with this Jansport bag.,"It was not as large as it appeared or the measurements indicated online. The fabric wasn't a firm or heavy as larger bags. Overall look was a cheap bag, not the same quality as Jansport larger bags."
5,Perfect little diaper bag and kid pack,"I am not a fan diaper bags that weigh a ton. I wanted a small and inexpensive but durable backpack so my hands could be free to care for my son. This JanSport pack is perfect! It's big enough for my small frame (I'm 5'2"") and fits only what I need. The best part is that my son can carry this pack himself when he's able to walk. If you want something to store diapers, wipes, spare clothes, your wallet and a few other handy items, this it it."
2,not what the picture shows it to be,the size is perfect but the straps are sooo uncomfortable...really stiff not padded at all like the pic says...wish i returned it.
2,Not what I expected,"A lot smaller than I imagined. Was looking for a simple light weight backpack without a million compartment and that was perfect, but way too small. Just didn't work."
4,Super durable....just wish the straps were padded,"I grew up using Jansport backpacks, and have always loved their durability and warranty. Rightly so, I purchased this one for my son. It's the great backpack I've always known, except one little thing....the straps are not padded. If the straps were padded, even a little, it would make this a 5 star. Other than that, it's great and I highly recommend it."
5,I LOVE THIS BAG!,"I have two nike bags like this and love them, worn them out. Found out they no longer sell them. This bag is great if not better, cuz it has more pockets. Iwill by more colors soon... shipping was fast. So happy i purchased. Thank u for a great item. People look at my bag and say thats a mini jansport....love it!"
5,Loved BackPack,"Material wasn't as expected, and the straps for the shoulders are small and none padded, if this were to change I would buy every signle design that I like!! I love the all black one I got and the black and purple zebra. Will buy light blue in the future! Thank you Amazon, and seller!"
4,Streamlined Backpack for Women,"I know the other reviews referred to children getting this backpack, but I saw a grown woman wearing it at Disneyland and was tempted to get one myself. I wanted something simple for hiking and taking quick trips (via boat) and it worked like a charm. I didn't want to drive all the way to R.E.I. (30 miles away), and the single strap, smaller backpacks at Target were not my style. I wanted something sturdy and not smacking against me while walking. I also wanted something with extra compartments and the little pocket in front is good enough. This little backpack fit a lot: camera, cell phone, wallet, binoculars, maps, hat, sunscreen, and a little jacket. I would recommend this for anyone of any age! However, please note that it is not waterproof. If it were, then I would give it 5 stars. I do like the lifetime warranty you get with it."
4,Cute!,"I got this bag to carry a few things with me when I go hiking. I thought it would be more organized, but the inside is just a big hole. There is a small pocket on the outside (good for cellular), but that's it. Other than that the bag looks cute, carries what I need, and the price was the cheapest I'd seen even out of E-bay mini packs."
2,Problems with setting up,The documentation provided with the phones is not sufficient. Experienced difficulty connecting to Skype and have had to spend many hours over many days communicating with product support via email.
4,"Works well, poor battery life","I bought this handset to work with the Linksys CIT400 base station. The netgear phone appears to have identical software to the Linksys and so far is completely compatible.The device has 2 shorcomings that bother me, the first is that there are no ""contacts"" for the landline - the contacts are stored in Skype format (on Skype) and I cannot figure out how to successfully dial landline to landline for a local call from the contacts list.Secondly, the battery life is very poor, the handset needs to be stored on the charger or the battery is dead within a couple of days.Other than that it is a fine phone, I use Skypeout primarily for international calls and save about $20 a month on my phone bill."
1,No base charger included so phone cannot be recharged,"I ordered this phone through Amazon Marketplace and a store called IE Store. Do not buy this item from them!If you do, be aware that you will not be able to recharge the phone since they don't include the base charger (even though the picture shows it and says the item is new). If you are trying to add an extension to your existing Netgear SPH200D phone system you will need the base unit to keep the phone functional. I don't know why they send you a ""power adapter"" since the phone does not have this type of connection. The power adapter only plugs in to the base charger, which they don't send.I bought this phone to replace an existing phone whose display screen got cloudy, so it will work for me, since I already have the charger base.The phone itself is great, but is useless with the base charger."
3,Skype cordless Phone,"I have been using the Skype/ Netgear SPH150D for over four years, It has some minor problems once in a while, but generally very happy with it."
1,bad bad bad,i got 2 phones and they dont work.very very bad. please dont ever buy it. intead buy linksys
3,Rhyming--not search and find,"I got this for my 4 year old niece. It's ok. I expected more of a search and find book which is NOT what this is at all. It's more of a rhyming book, but she'll like it all the same."
5,Exceptional sheet cake pan with lifetime guarantee,"After nearly 25 years of cake decorating, I finally found great baking pans worth the money. Wiltons old Performance bakeware line was just ok BUT Wilton's Decorator Preferred bakewear far exceeds every other pan I have ever owned. The perfectly straight sides, square corners and nice edges for grip are great but these Extra-thick aluminum pans distributes heat more efficiently than any others bake pans on the market, with the added bonus of a Lifetime Warranty...who could ask for more. This sheet cake size is the most requested for the cakes I decorate, they clean up great (I always grease & flour my pans) and the weight is just right."
3,Bellflower,"Some of the reviews of this movie seemed to suggest that as a first-time effort by a film director its quality was unparalleled. One had the idea that this was some sort of once in a century film in terms of its promise. I didn't think it was quite that good. In fact, depending on one's taste, it might nob be interesting at all. Some of one's response to it would depend on one's tolerance for the life-style of the characters, and presumably tha auteur. Still, thinking back on it now, it probably is somewhat innovative, although at the time (and now) I thought I would have little interest in seeing it again."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!,"1) Great, awesome movie.2) DVD Blu-ray in one box, plus.3) Did I mention how absolutely awesome the movie is?"
4,Good story,"Brink's novel is incredibly descriptive. I was in Paris when I read the book and could clearly see in its pages the city, its allure--and its more seedy side.He captures wonderfully both the intrigues of diplomatic and Parisienne life. Romance, misty nights, closed-door meetings, Pigallian night clubs, political leverage, French bistros, scandal...it's all there! The story does lag in parts, but Brink generally keeps the tempo moving."
4,All the capabilities,"this scheduling software can do anything you need it to do. it's not simple enough to use, though, without having either studied the users manual in depth or taken a college course on the software. i have take a course on the software so it works great for me."
5,Great,"I had been looking for quality pans for some time. I have usedWilton since I was quite young and have always been pleased.I liked these pans because of their 2 inch sides...nice, even, high layers! After cooking there's none of that ugly discoloration and they clean very easily."
3,ok,they are not so notvlw i like tha my son went to a sleep over and know one could tell what happen it was great. goodnites wirt trim fit are better then the old ones.
5,Bomb proof. Elephants could dance on this bugger :-),"I never (in my wildest dreams) thought that there was a ladder this heavy-duty. We had a cheap step-ladder in our office, that failed & we were lucky the guy wasn't hurt, because he was unloading heavy stuff. So we were determined to replace the cheapie ladder with the heaviest-duty mother we could find.This is it.We just unboxed this big boy and everyone in the office was a bit speachless (yeah, I know....it was a slow day here :-)Anyway, if you're looking for an indestructible step ladder that could serve as a decent bomb shelter -- this is it!!!"
3,Tough to store or haul,"The step ladder is indestructible but it can't be folded shut so it is tough to haul or store. If I had know that, I would not have purchased it. This step ladder is large."
5,"Professional quality, not for amateurs","At just $1 per pound rated capacity or $10 per inch this step stool is a bargain. It meets OSHA standards, which are quite high, as well as ANSI. The name alone is worth an extra $270: Ultra Pro Series Type 1A Step Stands. Get one before the price drops!"
1,How Much Money ??,I've got one of these but it sure didn't cost 300 PLUS DOLLARS. What is going on Amazon?
4,a neat book for certain,"i am a design student and am working on poster design. this book certainly helped fuel my imagination. its scattered with great photos of Armin's various posters. great color pictures, very nicely put together and designed. i recomend it for students who want some good reference material. it will definately help. great book!"
1,Misleading,Totally disappointed with this book. Basically a list of website addresses that offer tips and information but not free stuff. This information could have been easily found searhing on line...and for free!
3,Great,"I love the show and this deserves 5 stars. One CD didn't work, but it was too late to return. It's hard to check every CD when ordering full 8 seasons, especially when it's a gift!"
4,Pretty good knife!,"I've had this knife for close to six years now. It has stayed razor sharp through lots of use, good for whittling wood. It's small but nice for a its size. Ideal for a person's first knife or for a boy scout. Not a new knife owner but a collector of many buck knives, hammer knives, case knives, scharade knives, CRKT, KaBar, and various other brands throughout my life and for the price it is nice and small but a pretty good rounded little knife."
4,Why isn't anyone holding the police dept. responsible?,"I saw the footage. This is not a movie!, it's a live ,true recording. Three people are dead because the police department did not act ,and did not respond on time. They should be held responsible and should take responsibility for their negligence . The 911 dispatch taking all the calls from Samantha and Nate should be fired. If I were the parents of the victoms I would sue the police department .They need to make sure they change the response time when someone keeps calling for help on the same amber alert case over and over again. Disgusted and heart broken by this footage. May God help the families of the victoms. My condolences."
2,Are there no police in Arizona?,"This was such a great idea...in theory it could have been a great thriller, even on its minimal budget. Unfortunately the Bellessa family did not spend a penny to hire someone to write a decent script or to hire a decent actress to play Sam. Summer Bellessa has to be one of the worst actresses to disgrace a B film ever. She overacts by screeching and exaggerating every gesture. It got so bad that by minute 22, my husband left to walk the dogs rather than endure another minute. I have conditioned myself to tolerate some very bad movies, so I stuck with it. It gets better and actually manages to build a little suspension and tension near the end. Thumbs up for the guy who played Nate (Jasen Wade?) he's actually funny and has some clever lines. Great idea. I'd love to see someone with some money make a decent movie out of this."
1,Terrible,Terrible movie. Don't recommend watching it all..don't waste your money and don't waste your time on this movie. Hated it
3,Amber Alert,I didn't like the way the camera shots were done running. Good storyline but depressing. I recommend to suspense lovers.
3,Fairly Entertaining,"If you are tired of the handicam movie genre, then this movie is not for you... avoid at all cost, but if you love handicam movie it will certainly enterain you for 90 minutes."
5,Just WOW!,This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole way thru! It was so real to me that I got online afterward to see if I could find out more information on the case...just to find that it WAS just a movie!! Maybe it's just the mom in me but it REALLY tugged on my heart strings :( My heart is still beating like crazy!
4,See this movie,"""Amber Alert"" is a movie for the person who likes uncomfortable suspense. This movie took me on a ride of slow building suspense to an unexpected, but great ending. I appreciated the characters as they seemed so normal/real and when put in a dilemma, they responded normal/real. I would definitely recommend it."
3,Overpriced,"The rack is nice, however I thought a little overpriced. This is something I could have made on my own for cheaper."
5,Sweet rack!,Good quality and made of wood so it fits into our design real well. The dowel on the front is flexible enough to have some give and the appearance is nice.
4,Nicely made.,"This is a nice spice rack. Well-made and attractive. I hung it on the wall above my stove and it looks really nice. It just fits the spot. I could get 11 spices in it, some of them are the larger kind. I agree with another reviewer, though, that the color is not as it appears online. It really is a natural color, much lighter than the picture. Still looks nice, but you should be aware of that before ordering. I would recommend it."
4,good so far but expensive due to taxes,I got it shipped to Europe and after few days I got a notice from Fedex asking me to pay them nearly 30 for taxes. Those 30 on top of what I paid for the filter make it as expensive as the one I was buying from aguapura. Will not buy it again because the quality is the same but I do strongly recommend it for people living in the US.
5,FANTASTIC!!! THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING,"Well, I watched this movie just last night, and I have to admit it left my jaw on the ground! How the ice fell into the water was amazing and the sounds of the glaciers were soooooo beautiful! It sounded like thunder. I definitely recommend this movie. IT was very well put together and it is very educational!!! It is full of action and I loved seeing the harbor seals!!! I have never been to Alaska, but this one has made me really want to go!!!"
4,NEXT BEST TO BEING THERE,"This DVD is great. Watching these glaciers as they change makes you feel like you are there. Not only is the scenery beautiful, this DVD also is very educational and I learned alot about the glaciers from watching it - which makes the glaciers even more fascinating. I always thought it would be exciting to travel to Alaska, these calving glaciers and this dvd's captivating footage make me want to go there even more now."
3,Shut Up!,"The video is good, it's just that the narrator just keeps talking and talking. We want to see the video, not listen to her yaddle!"
1,Low Budget Disappointment,"I cannot believe this video had a five star rating. I feel ripped off.Here's why:-All the footage appears to have been shot using a home movie camcorder.-They talk about how amazing glaciers sound when they crack...but you never hear it because the sound quality is so bad. And on top of that there's super annoying tourists yelling ""whoo hoo!"" ""Yay!"" in almost every shot. Gets old fast.-Terrible soundtrack. Generic filler drivel.-Poorly written narration.Watching huge chunks of glacier fall into the ocean IS pretty cool--but the sound, image, and music quality are so bad that this film was actually painful to watch."
5,"WOW, just WOW.","Living in NYC, I never thought I'd have the opportunity experience calving glaciers. This video was so thrilling. Now, even more than ever this video makes me want to travel to Alaska and witness with the naked eye. Amazing production guys, genuinely captivating."
5,best flim ever,its the best movie ever after visiting alaska 1 month later reminded me of alaska so muck and then someone told me to buy the alska dvd and now everytime i miss alska i just watch the movie its fantastic the graphics are great you should definetly watch iot.
3,order more than you need,"These bulbs look great when they work. About half of the ones I received work well, the other half are duds. The duds don't really flicker, they just kind of blink."
5,very informative read,"This book is an extremely informative analysis of genesis, and its role in our current culture on many levels. I enjoy and appreciate this authors educational experience and cultural veiws. Anyone who has read this authors analysis may also enjoy ""After the Apple"", which is another one of Rosenblatt's writings."
2,Only of interest because Stratten is in it...,"Suppose this is a must-have if one is an avid Stratten fan. I'll agree she demonstrates some potential that might have translated into her becoming a decent actress had she lived. Not an Oscar-caliber actress, but a DECENT actress. Outside of that, I really didn't find this flick all that interesting. Then again, I'm really not into bondage/women-in-chains/sex-slave type films. This type of movie, along with the Playboy stuff, are indicative of the kinds of entertainment Stratten was hoping to leave behind as her career moved forward, and the abuse she portrays in this movie is all the more disconcerting considering the types of real-life relationships she had and the way she died."
3,A Gem for Dorothy Fans,"This isn't a great movie by any means, but is very worthwhile for fans of Dorothy Stratton. People who aren't should probably not bother with this movie.By the way, just to correct an error in a review below by someone who claims, obviously falsely, to be a video fan - Dorothy Stratton did NOT play a cabbie in ""They All Laughed"". That was Patti Hansen, who was also a past Playboy Playmate. You'd think a video fan would get that right..."
4,I thought this film was very erotic!,"Director Lloyd A. Simandl has a flair for films involving gorgeous young females being enslaved by older, more dominant women. The late Dorothy Stratten plays Tara Dawson, a young girl who is kidnapped and placed in a girls' reformatory run by Monica Freeman, an older lesbian woman played by Jocelyn Fournier. Tara is treated rather brutally, at least at first. But later there's a very erotic scene where Monica bathes her and then takes her to bed. Dorothy wasn't a great actress, but she certainly had a beautiful body! In that sense this film was certainly worth seeing!"
3,Eye Candy- Tasty but Unfulfilling,"A bizarre and artsy film that unfortunately lacks an emotional punch to back up the interesting visuals. The Brothers Quay are primarily animators and designers. I do not regard them as filmmakers, per se. Their films are fairly unique and surreal, drawing from the works of Jan Svankmajer and Guy Maddin, German expressionism and stop-motion animation, but the stories seem overly cerebral and nonsensical- weirdness for weirdness' sake. I think their early film ""Instituta Benjamenta"" was slightly more coherent, but this is a much more visually striking film."
2,Hard to follow but beautiful.,"I purchased this because the synopsis was interesting to me, and even though I thought the imagery was beautiful and eerie, I felt like this fell a little flat.The plot seemed paper-thin to me. I watched it with my girlfriend and it was very hard to follow. The ending was strange and obscure, and we wound up 'not getting' most of the movie.I know that some reviews have said that there is a lot of symbolism in this film, but I still fail to see it. When I write, I use a lot of symbolism, and if there actually is some of this going on in the film, it was so bizarre that I completely overlooked it.The film left me a little bored overall, but I plan on giving it a second chance anyway. After all, I did purchase it."
4,great read,When I received this book - I started reading it and couldn't put it down. It detailed a night in Atlanta history that I've only heard mentioned in passing. This fire truly changed the fire codes across the country and for that we should be thankful.I found it interesting that the hotel has been renovated under another name. I will make a point to visit it next time I'm in Atlanta.An unexpected bonus is that the author of this book is the person who sold the book to me - and he autographed it. He is still very interested in meeting anyone with a family connection to any of the victims of this fire to hear their stories.
4,Sometimes rough but it grows on you!,"My first exposure to Joni Mitchell came from her ""Blue"" album so I was a little disappointed with this one. Clouds, in some ways, seemed like a rough draft of a better album. The album's engineer didn't do her any justice on this one either (unlike Blue which was superbly engineered). But after listening to Clouds a few times, Joni's voice and warm melodies somehow overcome the albums rough edges. Overall, the album is good but you have to listen to it a few times to let it sink in!"
5,Quietly beautiful...,"I agree with everyone that Joni has made better albums, and that she was just discovering her greatness. However, I also think that with the exceptions of Blue and Court and Spark, there are no other Joni albums I would rather put in and listen to staight through. All of the songs fit together so beautifully that is is hard not to lie back and have a simple moment of perfect contentness while listening to this album. This is one of my favorite albums for when I just want to feel something powerful."
3,Clouds-a little too wispy,"Although I love most of the other Joni albums I have, I only listen to a few songs on this one- That song about the midway, Chelsea morning, and Both Sides Now, which is such a beautiful track that you should buy the cd just for it. Most of the other songs are a little weepy and melancholic- Joni's voice is strangely high and warbly, I get annoyed when I listen to it. Don't buy this early effort as a first Joni cd or a gift- but don't miss out on the lovely ""Both Sides Now."""
5,"Simply beautiful, striking and full of depth","Clouds is the perfect title for this collection of songs. On the surface are the beautiful, simple melodies and the airy voice of Joni Mitchell. Like the changing landscape of the sky, the lyrics have simple and deep meanings, that can change over time, but always remain meaningful. When this album was originally released in the 60's, my best friend and I sang the two part version of ""The Gallery"" in a cafe in Paris. Although few in the cafe spoke English, they all loved the music."
5,Tragic beauty,"With a sole guitar and her voice, Joni Mitchell has achieved perfection. Showing lyrical power reminiscent of Bob Dylan, she has described some incredibly lovely and tragic scenes. Of course her original version of Both Sides Now is THE version, no disrespect meant to Judy Collins. The Gallery still gives me the chills. Listening to this depresses me extremely, though, to think of how Joni's voice is a bare shadow of this incredible work."
2,Nine Minutes,"I lasted nine minutes before I shut it off and put on a different DVD. There's not much I can add to what everyone else has said in criticism of this DVD. If it were just boring and repetitive, I would still keep it and occasionally do it. But Ms. Rocker's CONSTANT never-shutting-up coupled with her uncomfortable cranky arrogance were too much for me. I was begging her to shut up at four minutes and couldn't take it any more at nine."
4,I bought this last year...,I recommend this for anyone who wants a good cardio workout that has intervals and lower body strength moves. I am not able to do other workouts that work the upper body a lot. I have gotten in very good shape just doing the 3o minute workout (a recent study posted in _Precision Nutrition_ says that a moderate workout is sufficient); sometimes I do some or all of the 5o minute routine. One thing I do (since I have a fitness background and know proper form) is play my own music while doing the workout (just mute or turn down the volume a bit) so that I have more energetic music to motivate me. All in all I recommend this video for the reasons stated and I can take it as easy as I want or challenge yourself. P.S. I first borrowed this from the library and tried it and recommend that for any video workout.
4,walking for weight loss with debbie rocker,I like this video alot. it's not so strenuous that i quit after one time. easy to follow. easy to do
2,Somebody turn off the talking,"I bought this video hoping for something I could do when it rains and I cannot walk outside. I saw the positive reviews on this one and decided to give it a try. The workout is good - the constant, droning chatter is not. If they had designed this video like the New York Ballet video I would have been very happy (In the NY City Ballet Video you can turn off the talking after you've mastered the exercises, while keeping the music). All in all I gave this a 2 star rating because it may be better than nothing (although I have wondered). If you want to enjoy your walking stick to the outdoors!"
3,Interesting but very biased,"Mr. Chomsky presents some interesting arguements especially the parallel between narcotics and tobaco but his point of view is so one sided and cynical that it is hard to take him seriously. He makes a lot of accusations without presenting any facts, he just seems to say everyone knows this or that. He also seems to be an apologist for the FARC and ELN, the left wing rebel groups, as he ignores their well documented history of drug trafficing, kidnappings, bombings and assasination. He attributes all of Colombia's problems and human rights violations to the government and the AUC, the right wing rebels. He does mention that the FARC taxes coca production but he forgives it because they tax everything.I think the CD is worth listening to but should not be the only source of information on the subject and definately not taken at face value as his selective use facts diminishes his credibility."
4,Wonderful Thoughts,"This has some wonderful insight, and I was pleased with the regular use of the church fathers to illuminate the meaning of Christ's passion. Every reading is based on a specific scripture - and these scriptures progress from the triumphal entry to his ascension. Definitely worth an extended read."
4,"Color stays, gloss is shiny, no weird taste!","I didn't have any trouble with my lips becoming glued together like the other commentator did. You apply the color portion, let it dry for a couple minutes (it becomes slightly tacky, then dry), then apply the super-shiny clear gloss. There was even some still on after drinking from a glass and that makes the permanence of the color better than many, in my experience! Lots of nice colors available, too."
2,Drys my lips OUT,"I bought the endless ruby color of this product and yes the color is beautiful on my lips. But after 4 hours my lips start to peel. Its great for going out for a few hours but for long wear like working, its a no-no. Also if you mess up, thats it. theres no going over it to fix it. One shot on kill type of thing. Overall I wouldn't recommend it."
3,it is ok,"it is very much liquid...lip balm does not stay for long time, however I liked the lipstick and it stay for long time"
1,Done with this product!,"I've always been pretty happy with Maybelline. Usually I get a good bang for my buck with them. But their products have begun to really get mediocre. The eyeliner smears and this stuff is garbage... Here's why..No matter what you do, this lipstick doesn't stay put. It feathers, fades off, rubs off, slides, off, it just plum doesn't stay on your lips. I usually will get any dry skin off my lips with a wet toothbrush and have a ""clean canvas"". The applicator makes a mess and the product hardly stays in the lines. It takes forever to dry and when it does, its wanting to come off. Applying the clear coat makes it even worse and that's when the bad feathering begins. I can't even get through an hour of two of work without having to reapply this lipstick. I am so unhappy with this stuff and after buying it for many years, am about to throw my latest tube in the garbage and stop buying it!"
1,Icky-Sticky,"Shame on you Maybelline! I tried this product and it lasts alright - STICKS LIKE GLUE - LITERALLY! I applied the color and the followup gloss/conditioner and within 30 seconds wanted to remove it because it made my lips stick together - not just a bit - a lot! Thing is - 24 hours later I was still trying to remove it tried following their removal suggestions; I tried soap and water, cold cream - nothing worked. I returned it and got a refund. One of the worse makeup experiences I've ever had. Shame, shame."
1,CLUMPY YUCK!,Either way worn glass then lipstick or vice versa will leave you running for the bathroom to rub that clumpy mess off of your lips.One of the worst lipsticks I've ever tried!
1,HOW HORRIBLY GLOPPY GOOKY IS THIS FLAMING RED MESS?,"Take my word for it. It's Gunky within 1/2 hour in the mirror trying to get the pasty balls off your mouth. The one thing it does do, is provide a stain of some sort. anywhere instantly. If you go over the edge in which you will because its very runny. it will be hard to fix the stained mistakes."
5,Wildberry Maybelline Superstay Lipcolor 16-Hour Color + Conditioning Balm 1 ea,"I love this product. I wear ""cool"" colors and this is perfect for my complexion. You put it on in 2 steps and it lasts all day. The price was very good. I will buy this again, and again...."
3,color is good,"it does not stay on for ""hours"". the color is good but it is drying to the lips. will not order again."
3,"Nice color, poor performance.","The color is gorgeous and easy to apply with a precise line. I am allergic to lots of makeup, but this lipstick didn't bother me at all. I really wanted to like it, but will probably not wear it much. After eating, the color only remained on the outer edges of my lips. (I didn't wipe with a napkin, and only ate a small amount.) It looked ridiculous because it is such an intense color. It took quite an effort to remove the rest of the color. I guess on dry skin, it lasts, but cannot withstand moisture. If I have to keep reapplying, it is no better than cheap lipstick."
2,More Berry than Red/Orange,Never order cosmetics online unless you've tried them elsewhere first. Has staying power but not the colour it appears to be in the picture. I gave it away.
1,Never got to use it,"This was sent to me taped up. I thought it looked used. When I opened it, I looked on the bottom and it had already expired. I never got to use it. The person who sold it had no idea and was willing to correct the problem ASAP."
4,Good,"This is a documentary about UFOs made by the people who made the UPN show Strange Universe. It is pretty good, but they don't list people's names that they interview. They also get off-topic later in the video. The video is about UFOs, but now they start talking about ghosts, and then legends. But, I reccomend it to anyone interested in UFOs"
1,Save Your Money!,"I love Dick Gregory, I just wish I could hear what he's saying in this video. This is just a video of him speaking in a church caught on a video camera with terrible audio. A fly-by, on the cheap, totally non-professional production. Extremely low budget release. It's a shame there isn't a professional taping of a Dick Gregory performance available. I was really looking forward to this. Save your money and buy his books and records."
5,"Ladies, you have got to read this book!!!","If you want a really good book to read that is very romantic, yet filled with enough action, treachery, and suspense for you and your man to enjoy, this is a really good buy. The love scenes, hmmm. What more can I say? I loved the romance between the main character and his wife, and their daughter was simply adorable. Dispite his faults, he's the kind of man a girl wants in her life. I must admit, however, that the villian was good, too, and you will be surprised at the ending. Buy it as a gift for your significant other as I did, then read it yourself. You'll be glad you did. I also bought a copy for my grandpa. He finished it in less than three days. Obviously, there is going to be a sequel. The author really captures his character's voices! Terrific!"
5,Profound and practical,"Having been in the middle of a number of crisis communications incidents at a university and medical institution, I immediately related to Baron's examples of the feeding frenzy that is the media world today. His discussion of the tendency to seek easy villains without concern for truth is very useful to draw on when talking to people caught in the middle of a feeding frenzy - or even people just trying to plan for the inevitable day when there will be a crisis. I was reminded of reasons that many of us have left journalism ... That all said, one should quickly note that it's not just the media that create the frenzy - it's also all of us who consume the media. And now, many of the people who were formerly consumers can 'make' news themselves. Baron covers all the new ways that people in all parts of the community can use technology to raise issues, both for good and bad."
5,Great Stuff,"This is a great recording. Laurindo plays beautifully, as you would expect from a guitarist of his caliber. But what strikes me the most is the contribution of Bob Magnusson. This is one of the greatest double bass performances that I have ever heard. The combination of Almeida with his nylon string guitar and Magnusson's melodic DB playing is really something to hear. This is one of my favorites. It's worth the price of the CD to hear the Beethoven/Monk meld."
1,Cost is too high,"Cheaper to buy these diapers at the local store. Amazon - I'd rather order through you, but I'd pay $3 more per pack - that's about 40% more than the local storeNormally I love to shop at Amazon, but not for diapers. In this case, Amazon stinks."
3,sizes run smaller,huggies actually kept my baby drier than swaddler (pampers baby dry feels rough). but the sizes run smaller than the same size pampers. i used size1 huggies as NB diapers. he has outgrown size1 huggies but can still use size1 pampers. another annoying thing (and could be the reason why other's are leaking) is that the blue gathering is stuck together to the diaper and so you have to pull it off each time so that you have two layers of protection. what a pain (...)...literally.
3,this diaper I don't know!!??,"For my son he must of leaked through them ever day about 3 times a day. I would have to change him every hour sometimes, he is 6 weeks old. I found that the Pampers swaddelers work much better no leaks so far if diaper put on right"
1,Blah!,Every other diaper presented leakage.These sizes run small and just do not protect against leaks.Try the Pampers Swaddlers.
2,disappointind,It doesn't spray with any force or if it is at any angle other than upright. You have to do two square inches of your body at a time.
3,okay,"It is a good lotion, but my husband doesn't like how slippery it is if I spray it in the shower."
5,Another Kantra Winner!,"Annie's got a felony conviction, an almost ex-husband who's out to get her and tried to murder her best friend, and a young son she'd do anything to protect. She doesn't need one more complication in her life. Yet, when Maddox ""Mad Dog"" Palmer, walks into town, complication is just what she's got. He's asking questions, looking for answers. But does he want the truth, or is he just out to help her ex-husband shut her up? Annie and Maddox work to come to terms with their pasts and forge a future that includes each other.Virginia Kantra tells another emotional story of love in Mad Dog and Annie!"
4,Enjoyed!,"(Actually, that's four and a half stars up there.) I wish covers would note -- honestly -- that a reader won't be able to set down a particular book. I'd have started this one earlier in the day and my eyes wouldn't have been so bleary the next. It's a short book that doesn't meander into subplot and keeps its focus directly on the lead characters, who have full lives and mesh well. In particular I was drawn to Annie, the abused wife who has with this volume undergone therapy. It was fascinating to watch her taking her lessons to heart and refashioning her life. The way her son adapts to their new life was also an emotional rollercoaster. There was the slightest of problems with head-hopping early in the book, but it didn't last long. Overall, this is a real page-turner with extremely likeable characters, a serious villain who is not hokey, and a wonderful attitude about changing your life for the better. Looking forward to Virginia's next book!"
5,Great Story!!,I love these second chance stories and if any character deserves a second chance at happiness it is Annie. This is my favorite book in this series.
3,Linda Howard is good even in a harlequin format,"This novel is slight compared to Kantra's later novels but it has many of the same elements, conflicted but formidable heroes and doughty heroines striving to find the courage to stand up to enemies and find happiness. In this story a divorcing wife with a vulnerable child stands against her husband's abuse, supported by a policeman with a troubled past. He is also the boy she should have chosen in high school. How the hero and heroine finally join forces, and how the young policeman makes peace with his father both are worth a read."
5,in love with words,"leonard cohen is one of canada's most lyric authors. his words are like honey for a sore throat. anyone who is willing to spend a little time with cohen is willing to learn about heartache, love and life. altogether an absolutely delicious read, although not a quick one."
5,Son absolutely loves this DVD!!!!!,"Little man is so into Jake & the Never Land Pirates. This DVD is wonderful. Lots of shows to enjoy!!!! Highly recommended to everyone, girls and boys alike!!!!!!"
4,Amazon DVD purchase,"My children love Disney and the new series Jake and the Neverland Pirates. They love the DVD so they can watch it in their rooms. With the low price and free shipping how could I resist. Disney and Amazon, doesn't get much better than that."
1,Buyer Beware ... This DVD was Made for the European Market,"I was looking forward to watching a movie about the Comedian Harmonists and purchased a DVD from M&L.; The DVD was promptly mailed and promptly received. Sadly, I found that I could not play this DVD on any of my systems because it was in PAL format. The Phase Alternating Line system is an analogue television color encoding system used in broadcast television systems in Europe, the Middle East, and large parts of Africa, and Asia. It is not used stateside. Here in the states, we use an NTSC format.What does any of this mean? The DVD I purchased was clearly meant for the European market. Unless you have a DVD and TV player with multisystem capabilities, you won't be able to play this particular film.I was disappointed that at the time I made this purchase, the ad for this film did not mention that it was in PAL format. Had I known that this DVD was unplayable on any of my current systems, I wouldn't have purchased it."
5,Great film,A very enjoyable film with great music and acting. A well paced film based on true story. First saw this at a film festival and wanted to get the DVD so as to share with friends and family. Makes one realize how much European culture was sadly lost forever due to the politics/German regime and WWII.
2,Sony Accessory Kit,"The bag is great, the battery on the other hand is outdated for the new camcorder I also purchased and does not fit.Due to the fact it was inside the gear bag and I opened the box I now have been told I can not return for a refund. Could have purchased the battery locally for less than I now have in it and I still have to purchase a battery. Live and learn, last time I will use Amazon for a purchase."
2,Boring and arid reading,"Thios is another flop by Alfred Price. The guy is a scholar in World War II, but he just can't write compelling books. TARGET BERLIN is boring, altough it tries heroically to give a general view from all people involved (including some ground witenesses). But the final result is not pleasant at all."
3,Don't judge them by this album,"This band has two previous albums full of great material. Listening to the self-titled and Without Love will make you a fan. This Album has one good song on it, and it was the single. It was also the only song not produced by Gene Simmons. I don't mind KISS, but Black N Blue didn't need to sound like Gene Simmons and it ruined the sound of the band. Sorry guys that think this is the best album, it's not. Go listen to Without Love again. I think you missed something the first time around."
2,hardly worth it,This dvd is a low content production which tells the obvious. The coverage of the Bahamas was mediocre. I do not recommend this dvd for anyone who is interested in dinding out what it is like to be cruising or how to plan for such a voyage.
1,Beware of the jiggling,"This was a most frustrating DVD. It had one feature I have been searching for on an ocean recording--that of being able to isolate the ocean sounds from the music on a separate track. Most oean videos do not allow you to separate the surf sounds from the music. But this DVD does! But how disappointing to find jiggling artifacts on the waves in most scenes. Almost a strobe effect. And watching it was certainly not a relaxing experience, the main purpose of a mood video."
4,Excellent Camera,I borrowed this camera from a friend to take with me on vacation when my film camera broke. The camera performed flawlessly and I have printed out a number of absolutely spectacular photos from it. Very Impressed!
5,one year old 880,"I have had this camera one year and am still impressed with the quality of it's pictures. It certainly has some flaws ( flash pictures, noisy auto focus) but anyone who claims that this camera doesn't take fantastic pictures doesn't know how to use it or has a broken camera."
1,manual lens cap removal very annoying,"After 2 hears of removing the lens shade manually on my Nikon 880I will never buy another Nikon product again. Up to now, I have not found any reference to this irritating procedure in the Nikon manuals, specifications, or camera sale's blurbs. The battery charger & rechargeable battery's extra cost & time to recharge the battery negates owning a digital camera that should provide fast & easy use. The ready light does not go off when the battery is charged. Time between captures is more like 3 seconds, not 1 second as stated"
2,Disappointed!,"I bought this camera because I believed that the Nikon name insured that I would get a quality camera. I have owned a Kodak 1 megapixel camera, and have used it for over a year with excellent results. The Nikon, however, took a lot of tweaking to get average pictures. I took the camera in to a local camera shop, and tried it side by side versus some of the other 3 megapixel cameras (Canon, Olympus). The results were pretty shocking. All cameras were set to their highest resolution and set to ""Auto,"" and the pictures were taken by camera professionals. They were disappointed in what they were selling. The biggest disappointment I have is that the reviews I found on-line (dpreview.com, et al.) were very favorable towards this camera. If you are looking at a 3 megapixel camera, find a store that will let you try out several cameras FIRST, then buy."
2,Not as good as a Canon...,"I replaced a Canon Powershot S20 with the Coolpix. Even though I've only taken a few pictures (maybe 25) it clearly doesn't produce the same image quality with comparable file sizes.In normal mode (~700K JPGs) the Canon produced very sharp and balanced images. In comparison, the Nikon's pictures are blurry and look like they came from a digital camera. I tried higher quality modes (e.g. fine & high) with mediocre results.Overall I am not satisfied with the purchase and switch. The nicest feature of the Coolpix over the S20 is that you can attach various lenses to customize shooting. Lastly, comparing the two bodies (the Canon is metallic while the Nikon is plastic) leaves me feeling like I have a cheaper solution in my hand."
4,Great camera - but missing a bit,"It is a great camera - it takes excellant pictures, uses the almost ubiquitous CompactFlash media, and has a wealth of settings and options.The minuses: It doesn't come with a battery charger/ac adapter (you'll have to buy that separately), and it uses annoying batteries. (come on - 'AA' sized batteries can't be that hard to design for) These cameras eat batteries quickly enough that you really won't want to pay for the expensive alkalines or lithium ions."
3,A unhappy customer,"Overall this camera is OK. However, the price is not cheap at all, especially you have to spend another $120 to get rechargeable battery and charger. I would rather get Olympus digital camera with high quality, nice features and lower cost."
5,Great camera!,"Here are some of the pros: 1. Excellent picture quality and colors, even indoors and under fluorescent lights. 2. 2.5x zoom. 3. compact size. 4. presets (""scene"") mode good for amateurs.And cons... 1. You must (emphasis here) purchase rechargeable batteries separately...2. 8MB CF is small, very small. 3. slight red eye problem (and there is no flash socket). 4. Don't even bother installing the bundled software. It's not worth it. However the basic Nikon View and usb drivers work great and make transfering the pictures a snap."
4,Good Foundation for the Beginner,This DVD is a good foundation for the beginner in Texas Hold'em. It is hosted by Vince Van Patten of the World Poker Tour. You are walked through all steps of the game and it is a DVD I have gone back to many times to 'remember the basic'. No DVD can take the place of a real live game but this will give you information to understand what is happening during the game.
3,Color is Disappointing,"These ramekins are certainly worth the price and they do what they are supposed to do, but I was disappointed in the color. I love red, but these ramekins are more muddy maroon than red. I could handle a color that is not quite as described, but this one is way off the color mark. If it were a pretty color, I wouldn't mind as much. I wish I'd just gotten plain white instead of these. If you're looking for a maroon-ish color, then you will be might be happy with these."
4,"Love Kat, but...","Like everyone else said, the show rules, but the cardboard box is a bummer. Still a good buy!"
3,first was best,"The first season was the best, I think the show is getting boring, if you are a big Kat Von D fan, this dvd is deffinetly for you, enjoy!"
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this mouse based on previous, positive reviews. I use my mice on a thin mat specially designed for optical mice. This mouse does not respond well, even when settings have been adjusted. It feels light and fragile. The base of the mouse does not glide flush with the mat and wobbles. I put up with it for 2 days before going back an old intellimouse.If you want a cheap mouse for office applications then this mouse will probably be fine for you. However, if you need a mouse that will be responsive for graphics or gaming then this probably isn't what you want.It was a waste of money as far as I'm concerned."
4,Great debut,"One of the most fun records to come out of the two-tone scene. A lot of the recordings from second-wave bands lack the energy that was present in their live shows, but that's not true here. Check out some of these classics. My favorite is ""Night Boat to Cairo."""
5,This is THE Madness to get!,"Madness did it best the first time around. Their first album has, so far, outdone any ""best of"" collection. ""One Step Beyond,"" simply put, will keep the lamest party awake and hopping. Starting with the instrumental title tune, even the slowest paced tunes (My Girl, Razor Blade Alley), is a Ska-Based jolt of pep.What I enjoy about Madness above most other Ska bands is that their early music is sheer fun spirited song & dance, written in an era where it was becoming much cooler to throw a lot of social commentary into the lyrics. My favorite examples are a little 60s pop-culture with ""Tarzan's Nuts"" (one of the TV Tarzan theme songs), ""Rockin' In A Flat"" (if you have trouble waking up in the morning, spin this tune first thing after you creak out of bed); and ""Night Boat To Cairo.""""One Step Beyond"" is worth the extra money spent over their various compilations. A very good second place is their second album ""Absolutely,"" but their debut CD rocks above them all!"
4,Absolutely nutty!,"If you dig the second wave of ska and don't have this, or haven't even of heard of it, then it's time to introduce yourself to a milestone of the forementioned era! It has the classic pieces : One Step Beyond, Night Boat To Cairo...and one truely ""classical piece"" : Swan-Lake which is a great rendition of Tchaikowski's master piece. This is the record which shows the nutty-boys being more about ska than they get credited for. Some of the later records still rule, but the're a bit more about pop and a bit less about ska. This is THE article!"
3,Wasn't what I expected,"This book wasn't what I expected. It was described as a concise, easy to read intro. book, but was very technical in format. I felt like I was reading a doctoral thesis. I would reccommend it for someone who needed a quick review of SLA terms."
1,Don't know what to say?,"I have to give the author credit for research and hard work. Unfortunately I was hoping that when an author writes in the title of his book ""History"", we will find history without personnal opinions. Every now and then when he gets a chance to misrepresent Islam he does it in a very subtle way. Writing about previous History should be far from emotional and personal feelings, otherwise call the book my view about Arabs. This was also mentioned by a previous reviewer who listed a couple of mispresentations from the Quran. I studied the Area and the Quran so I do have some background, and I would hate for anyone to get a misrepresented History of this Area and Time period from this book."
5,loved the puzzle,I would like to see more of the greek jigsaw puzzles that you may have we love the puzzles.
5,Tom Lehrer,Tom Lehrer is ageless! Entertaining no matter what your political views - he was well before his time. A classic performer guaranteed to make you laugh.
3,Not original stuff,"Purchased all 4 Tom Lehrer CD's. as I have original Vinyl that I wanted to preserve. Some of the songs on the CD's are not accurate copies from the original Vinyl presentations. Monologues and some of the songs have been changed. If you are a real Tom Lehrer appreciator you will be somewhat disappointed..... If you are new to Tom Lehrer then you won't notice the modifications so this won't matter to you, as they are still enjoyable, just not original materal"
1,Give this book a pass,"I generally enjoy Marlene Suson's books, but I don't know what happened with this one. I couldn't make it to 100 pages before I put it down.The themes in this plot are so tired - the independent, take-over American girl who disdains English society and teaches everyone how ""superior"" Americans are...the evil stepmother. When the heroine decided to teach the Duke his responsibilities, I decided it was all too much for me. The characters are not especially likeable or realistically drawn and in the end, I simply couldn't believe in this romance. I'll wait until her next book and hope for better."
1,Wrong item,"Writing a review for receiving the wrong item doesn't really make sense to me... except apparently the same thing happened to the previous customer reviewing this product. I ordered the tiny Sunlite 8 function multi tool from Bike World USA, and instead received this product:TOOL ALLEN WRENCH PYR FOLDING SET 3-4-5-6mm & SCREWDRIV"
5,Best Iced Tea there is,I love this tea. Especially when I brew it with my Keurig coffee machine. The flavor is better than any Star... Coffee house.
4,"Help, My stomach gets upset with this tea.","I have always loved Lipton teas. It is a daily habit. I just bought a automatic tea brewer and loose tea for the first time. Almost immediately I started getting an upset stomach. It never occured to me that it could be the tea. I have never had a problem like this. After a week of stomach problems, and tring different solutions I finally stopped drinking the tea. Immediately my stomach was better. A few days later I started drinking the Lipton loose tea again and immediately my stomach was upset. I looked on the internet and a few suggested I add a bit of honey and a bit of salt. I tried that with no success. Does anyone else have any ideas? I hate to throw out six boxes of tea."
5,Refreshing and Vibrant,My mother and grandmother used this loose tea. It is so much more fresh and vibrant than any tea bags that are available in the markets. I'll never use another iced tea!
5,"It's loose tea, what else do you expect?","Product was exactly as advertised: Loose tea. I don't understand the negative reviews because this is the exact same stuff that comes in individual tea bags. Works great for iced tea made with my Keurig and the reusable filter cup. As a matter of fact, if I use an oversized-travel mug and the largest mug setting on the Keurig and fill the reusable filter 3/4 of the way with the loose tea, I get a very strong brew. Fill that the rest of the way with cold water, and I can get 3 glasses of iced tea."
3,Save your $$ and Buy a Better Quality Tea,Save your money and buy a better quality tea than Lipton Loose Tea. Tea is better than the bagged version but you will want to pour it through a fine filter before drinking because the leaves are broken and some are just very small particles.
2,Not Very Good Tea,"I've been drinking loose leaf tea for a while now and this has to be the worst stuff I have tried yet. I believe by ""Fine Tea"" they mean small particle size. My box is about the consistency of a box of dirt, instead of nice leaf parts. Following the directions did not produce a pleasant cup of tea. There is too much bitterness in this tea. I would definitely suggest checking out the Adagio teas. My Mother-in-Law gave me a sampler for Christmas and it had some excellent teas."
3,"Lipton Black Tea, Loose -- 6 1/2 lb boxes","The tea is not in itself a bad tea. however, i had wnated to order LIPTON YELLOW LABEL LOOSE TEA.The reason i ordered this tea instead was because although it was on the same page as LIPTON YELLOW LABEL and had the same type of cover (yellow + lipton) -- which is what misled me -- once i got the box i raelized it was not what i had wanted at all.i tried it but it did not suit my taste buds.i would suggest that you put this particular tea on some other page and not have it combined with lipton yello label loose tea. it is misleading entirely to put them together"
4,"Great Album, Great TV Series","This is a great album, it compiles some of the songs seen on the TV show. and the cover is even better :)Personnaly I think Melissa Joan Hart should do, among the series, Movies. She has already done 2 or 3 but she is better in dramatic roles rather than comedy ones (I am not saying she is bad at comedy, she is excelent, it's just my opinion)In resume, an excelent album, with the top songs."
4,Pretty good,"It has a lot of big names, just not the big songs. But it still has a ton of good songs, like Abracadabra, One Way Or Another, Show Me Love, etc. But then theres some bands in there I haven't even heard of, like The Murmers. It's a must get, Melissa even sings a song on it! It doesn't get any better than that. Although, there are those few annoying songs, like Smash, I Know What Boys Like, and even though I love The Cardigans, Blah, Blah, Blah. It still is a must get. I received it as a present and my first thoughts on it weren't that great, but it turned out to be way better than I thought."
3,For The Covers,"There is a lot here that has been previously released. But it's the cover versions that make this worth picking up.Most of the covers (remakes) have been created just for this soundtrack.Sugar Ray covers Steve Miller Band's ""Abracadabra""Melissa Joan Hart covers Blondie's ""One Way Or Another""Matthew Sweet covers Walter Eagen's ""Magnet & Steel""But the best cover here is from Pure Sugar (well known for 1998 dance hit ""Delicious"") withtheir cover of The Waitresses hit ""I Know What Boys Like"" It's a fun intresting twist for kids of all ages!You'll also find the 7"" Metro remix of Aqua's hit ""Doctor Jones"" that was previouslyonly on Aqua's UK CD single. This is a fun pop music soundtrack with lots of variety."
2,Be Aware!,From what I heard of the cd I thought it was going to be great but it really isn't that good. I was very disappointed. Alot of good artists are on it but the songs are not that great.
5,Sabrina!!!,"This soundtrack rocks!!!!In this soundtrack the Spice Girls have a new song.The sound is called ""Walk Of Life""!"
3,A music CD for the Kids!!!,"ABC's television show, ""Sabrina, The Teenage Witch,"" is the #1 show among teens and women and also in the Top 10 of all broadcast television with kids and teens. A perfect formula to cash in and Geffen definitely will score with this soundtrack. Let's see, who would some of these bands target for the TV audience? How about every top selling act for those age categories like the Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, Chumbawumba, Robyn and many others. Melissa Joan Hart who actually plays Sabrina also joins the mix and sings the old Blondie classic, ""One Way Or Another,"" and Sugar Ray give a great version of Steve Miller's classic, ""Abracadabra."" Not only is the soundtrack loaded, but many of these bands will also appear on TV shows in its upcoming third season. A definite witches brew of bands and music to cash in on what's hot with the kids and teenagers. Guaranteed to be a CD many parents will hear loud and clear from their kids' rooms in the next months!"
5,This One Set The Standard,"Completely original songwriting and playing. Peter Green (author of ""Black Magic Woman"") set the standard with this near perfect blues-rock recording. ""Oh Well"" is an emotional and ageless masterpiece combining both electric and acoustic guitar and great lyrics. For me ""Showbiz Blues"" is the strongest song on the album, but one could also argue for ""Coming Your Way"" or ""Rattlesnake Shake."" I owned this in vinyl a long time ago and wore it out several times. Although different in style, I rank this music with ""Who's Next"" and ""Sgt Pepper"" in its influence and importance in rock music. I can't think of another blues-rock album that matches this one."
3,Made From A Record ???????,"I had read a review stating that the mastering was poor on this CD before I purchased it. I usually remaster CDs to my own liking anyway. I found that in the quiet sections of ""Oh Well"" there was much surface noise from a record and at the end of track two, there were actually some clicks. I am not sure why Warners would release a CD made from a record or maybe Caimen purchased CDs from a pirate. You can't buy these tracks on Itunes so having the album is great, but I would prefer a CD from the original master tracks."
4,"Great Music, Not so Great Mix on CD","A great album. The CD conversion/remix isn't as good of quality as the original vinyl. I think this is the US version so it's missing Albatross, but My Dream is very close to being better."
2,Crap,"I love this album. Of all Fleetwood mac music this was my preferred album. The CD totally sucks, it's like listening to a scratched album. It just plain sucks."
4,Back in the Beginning . . .,". . . Fleetwood Mac made a great album. Peter Green's ""Oh Well"" is a bona fide rock classic, and Danny Kirwan's ""Coming My Way"" has a wonderful guitar sound. The real gem of this recording, in my opinion, is Green's heartfelt ""Back In the Beginning"" track, which moves me. This album is crying out for a high quality remaster."
5,Good O'l Fleetwood Mac....,"Yes, this album is from their classic line-up. Everything on this is great, if a little slow (Closing My Eyes).Of course, that's what makes it so great. Green's emotional side. Some classic FM tracks here though such as Oh Well (the full version) and Rattlesnake Shake.This is the first album to get if you want to hear the band in it's old days. Then search out The Blue Horizons Box set as well as the outtakes discs that are out."
3,Mac Plays On,"Fleetwood Mac originally a band that was heavily influenced by the blues in the vein of the early Yardbirds and The Bluesbreakers. Peter Green was the leader of the band that took its name from their powerhouse rhythm section of drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie. Jeremy Spencer was the second guitarist in the band that at first a quartet. On Then Play On they added a third guitarist Danny Kirwan and achieve a minor chart success. This version of the band had little in common with their future, mega successful version. But that aside, Then Play On contains some excellent guitar work and enjoyable songs. ""Oh Well"" is an amazing song and it showed the true genius of the tortured Mr. Green. The rest of the album is a solid, workman like effort."
2,blasphemy for a masterpiece,"what a shame one of the most important items of electric blues history does not have the treatment that deserves,this cd sounds like an old casette that played one million times."
5,in the pantheon of rock classics,"It's too bad that Fleetwood Mac has had so many incarnations, varied incarnations, over the years. In the end, they're really the story of a couple of the finest guitar players (Green & Kirwan) to ever play together. Sounds over the top, I know, but I think these guys were each touched by the gods in some cruel way. It's hard to find a sense of touch, fire, vibrato, soulfulness, clarity, tone and speed that Kirwan and Green both had. And look where they both ended up. Mad, alcoholic, homeless, wandering, broken. They probably reached their peak with Then Play On. Great, searching, avant-blues stuff."
1,amy,"Grant and Jason are the most egotistical, disrespectful opportunists. Their hotel had very weak evidence for being haunted. They are going to need this hotel because their celebrity days are numbered."
1,"Once honest, now greedy. TAPS!","I miss their first seasons. The vigor. The enthusiasm. The honesty. Now I see them selling their own hotel they bought (as ""plumbers""; yeah, right!)as ""haunted."" That is the most obnoxious ""get rich"" scheme from these ghost hunters.Grant scammed us last year in the live show. Now these ""plumbers"" are draining folks of their money. Once they told us real hauntings were rare. Now, if you (or they) own a hotel or bread and breakfast, they will certify it ""haunted"" and everyone rakes in the cash.This season is a scam. I believe their first 3 seasons were honest. Now, they are about the cash. Not one ghost hunter I know believes there is anything left legitimate about these once honest guys.I bought my last episode. I'm tired of being scammed with ""drama"" this season."
5,Massive Ghost Hunter Fan,"I own every Season of Ghost Hunters and can't ever wait for them to release the next season. I don't ever want the show to end. In this season they really haven't found too much, but as long as you have Steve and Grant to stare at who can complain. Then there is Jason. The ultimate Male. He is just plain amazing. And Chris Willaims is extremely beautiful and intelligent, I wish I could be in her shoes. The only other show that I even liked that is almost as good as Ghost Hunters is Ghost Adventures. Keep up the Great Work."
4,Season 5 part 1 review,"If you like this sort of stuff, I highly recommend it. It's Ghost Hunters, nuf said."
1,Palms outstreched for money,Looks like the truth comes out in season 5. Jason and Grant or portraying themselves as playboy millionaires that have money to throw around. They have defiantly strayed away from the original plumbers from the east that seemed honestly involved in their work
3,Good for diehard fans.,"I love this show, and have the entire series on DVD and was understandably excited for the 5th season to come out. However, I was pretty disappointed when I received this in the mail. For one, it is only 3 DVDs, as opposed to the past few half-seasons which are 4. Secondly, there is NO ""PLAY ALL"" option on the DVDs. Once you watch an episode, it goes back to the main menu. This is a major pain in the butt. It also seems production of the DVDs this time around was bare bones. On the main menu, you get the episodes, deleted scenes, and the option to have subtitles (admittedly, that's awesome, and it's about time). But there's none of the fun ""extra investigations"" from before, and the fact that they're no longer investigating peoples' homes is a little disappointing as well. In summary, if you're a diehard fan of the show, I recommend this set just to have it. If you're new to the show, try buying some of the earlier seasons instead."
3,Good for a scare,"Always entertaining, but a little annoying when they try to 'talk' to a ghost to get it to come out. If I were a ghost, I wouldn't talk to someone being that nerdish."
2,would only recomend to reality fans,if you like reality shows than you would probably like this for the relationships between the cast members. but if you are planing on getting this for some evidence of ghost/spirits/demons i would have to tell you to pass on this. you never see anything except the peoples faces and seeing how they react to noises that you cant even hear. its good for the old women who has a good imagination and likes to be scared... they will love it
5,Soloing to master works.,"There is only one better way to learn to play jazz solos. But seeing as though few people have a rhythm section at the ready, 24/7, this is the best way for the rest of us."
4,great luau music,Yeah ! Great background music for luau by Aloha Pumehana Serenaders. I need to get more.
3,Rating on New Testament in Modern Speech,"The biblesI just bought is o.k. it just needed to be larger and was not, They were in fair condition and readable but one of them had a 50 cent sticker on it from a used book store yet I paid 6$ for each of them including postage.I realize people have to make a living,but not at others expense when they live on small incomes and every penny counts.Mrs. Peggy Parnell."
3,Huw Lloyd-Langton - 'Night Air' (Allegro) 3 1/2 stars,"Good mid-'80's solo effort from off-again, on-again Hawkwind guitarist. Wasn't he an ORIGINAL member? About as decent as his 'On The Move' release (see my review). Better tracks are the opener title cut ""Night Air"", ""Painted Everygreen"", the straight-ahead rocker ""Candle Burning"" (sort of has a Hawkwind feel to it, I thought) and ""Alien Jiggers"". Line-up: Huw Lloyd Langton-guitarist&vocals, Kenny Wilson-bass and John Clark-percussion&vocals. Also wanted to mention that Langton's wife Marion helps him pen out lyrics, which is nothing to overlook."
1,Where's the beef?,A couple of paragraphs about how the author's twin pipes increased horsepower with sections that stated [ILLUSTRATION OMMITED]?? What up with that? Total waste of money.
4,Even if you dont play drums you'll enjoy this!!!,"So BRAIN is back with another hilarious, random and informative drumming video. If you liked SHREDDING REPIS ON THE GNAR GANR RAD you'll be able to enjoy this as well. Seems like BRAIN is very into making people understand that the 2 and 4 basic rock beat is all you need and IT'S TRUE.Lots and lots of comical moments. Buckethead makes a couple appearances and the two create some epic jams! Lots of dancing. Lots of nunchucks and karate kicks. There's conversations with monkey's. Brain buying a drumset from a garage sale and completly bashing the drums while the owner is in awe!Brain goes into detail about his drum sets. Being a big fan of BRAIN i get lots of pleasure out of the feature.I would say START WITH SHREDDING REPIS ON THE GNAR GNAR RAD and then buy this. Otherwise you might not understand the amazing person that is BRAIN!Shred on!"
1,The description of this item is a lie,"I wanted to buy a step ladder for a relative that specifically wanted one rated up to 375 lbs. I purchased this one and when it arrived I found that is only rated for 300 lbs. So I contacted Amazon and the SSF03 (which they have incorrectly rated as 300 lbs in the title) is actually the one rated for 375 lbs. Amazon REFUSES to update their incorrect information on their website. Amazon also refused to credit me for the cost of shipping back the incorrect item and since this is a heavy ladder, the shipping wasn't cheap.I LOVE Amazon, but this is a huge FAIL on their part :(Also they need to separate these items and have them listed separately rather than just a dropdown for 3 distinctly different items.The SSF03 is a good ladder and a decent price for what you would have to pay for it elsewhere. If it wasn't for the Amazon epic FAIL I would have rated the SSF03 as a 4 star."
4,The Truth Behind Huck,"The Adventures of Huck Finn is an outstanding work of classic literature. It's a must read, especially since schools all over have been banning it from their literary lists. The story focuses on a young boy who learns lessons about life and himself while helping a run away slave. There is much contraversey over the relationship between Huck and the man he is trying to save. Why not read the book and form your own opinion as to what is really going on."
1,WHY THE SUDDEN PRICE INCREASE????,"I HAVE BEEN ORDERING DIAPERS FROM AMAZON.COM FOR MONTHS AT $7.49 PER PACKAGE, NOW THEY ARE $11.29. THAT IS INSANE!! THEY COST LESS AT THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE! SHAME ON YOU AMAZON FOR JERKING AROUND THE PRICES!!!!"
3,Your experience may vary,"I started using Pampers with my newborn and then tried Huggies. We ended up throwing away almost an entire package of Huggies because each time we used them, the diaper leaked. To date this has not happened with Pampers.Also, I don't care for the gel clinging to my baby's bottom when I change her diaper."
3,sizes run small,huggies actually kept my baby drier than swaddler (pampers baby dry feels rough). but the sizes run smaller than the same size pampers. i used size1 huggies as NB diapers. he has outgrown size1 huggies but can still use size1 pampers. another annoying thing (and could be the reason why other's are leaking) is that the blue gathering is stuck together to the diaper and so you have to pull it off each time so that you have two layers of protection. what a pain (...)...literally.
2,Why price increase --- now,"I have been buying diapers from Amazon for a while now they are so expensive.Not sure why, they are cheaper not at Target.Bye - Amazon."
1,Price on the rise?,"What is going on? I have bought my diapers from Amazon for as long as I've had children...and now the price is going up? What's going on here? Bah! I'm going to drive 20 miles to the nearest town to save money on diapers, instead of having them shipped to my door...yah, that makes sense. What an INCONVENIENCE!!!"
4,Strong single with strong remixes,"After releasing a mediocre ""Everytime you need me"" single, Fragma comes back strong with You are Alive and 6 solid and creative mixes which range from melodic trance cuts from Blank and Jones (The team which brought you the club hit""Cream"")to tribal beats from Praha. Not bad for almost 30 minutes of music, however the import price is a bit steep for a single. If you are a fan of Fragma, get this disk just for the remixes."
2,"Must be rejecks, can not fasten base to seat.","I have spent seveal hours trying to attach base to seat, no luck. poor set of directions.All plates in wrong place, I have tried everything.Out of box and sitting in corner.Never had this problem before with several other seats fron Boats R US.Thanks"
2,"Delay, delay and excuses from Amazon CS","I'll keep it short. I ordered the boat seat on August 16th 2012, check by phone. After five (5) days and no status, I tried contacting the vendor (listed by Amazon) but they had no record of the order. Amazon contacted me and stated it would ""ship soon"".. Going on seven days now.. no product or shipping date..FYI- this is the second time I have ordered a boat seat from Amazon, the first time went ok- order was delayed several days also.My advise, do not purchase boat seats from Amazon, unless you want to wait weeks. I honestly would like to review the seats, if I ever receive them.."
3,"o.k., not much new","So far, I've only watched the PM walking segment. The scenery is lovely. The movements sometimes go on for way too long (such as the arm swinging, from low to high). Debbie says ""nice"" at least 20 times, and ""good"" for just as many. I found myself counting the nices and goods instead of concentrating on the walking."
2,Not for me,"This DVD was just too repetitive, marching, marching, marching. Mind you, I've done countless walking workouts using Leslie Sansone and Madeleine Lewis's workouts, both of which are varied, challenging, and fun.This one was just boring. Too much marching, not enough other moves, and Debbie talks SO much. Wow. I mean, maybe she was nervous but she was talking, it seemed, just for the sake of talking."
4,Pretty good... but could've been better.,"It's not the most exciting walking dvd I've ever done, but I do enjoy it. I wish there were a little less ""marching"" exercises, as others have said, and I also wish it were a little longer. But the scenery is just beautiful and I find it fun and effective enough. I do find myself using this dvd often."
2,One Step Away From Sleep or Yoga,"I'm new to walking for exercise, and thought this would be perfect, not intimidating. Well, the a.m walking is supposed to wake you up, and get you going, it was a level away from putting me to sleep! I never did get my heart rate up. The moves and the music were boring. She hardly ever gave a ""count"", so it was difficult to follow at times. The only great thing about this DVD is the scenery. If you're into yoga, you may like this DVD, otherwise look for something else."
5,Incredible array of footage,"As a Captain of a Dive Liveaboard and a Dive Instructor of ten years, this DVD never gets old. If you Dive, snorkel or just merely have a love for the underwater realm, then buy it, you won't be disappointed."
2,Good deal unless you want to see the FULL PRIDE BUSHIDO 9,"Now, I'd like to preface this by saying I own almost all PRIDE DVDs and that PRIDE is my favorite sports organization, period.However, this DVD set is a cheat. The main reason I bought it was to get PRIDE Bushido 9, which included the first and second rounds of the welterweight and lightweight tournaments. But the DVD only gives you a third of the fight card. You get the first round of the welterweight tourney and one alternate bout of the lightweight tournament and then the DVD ends as if that was the end of the PPV.I advise you don't buy this DVD set if you are in any way interested in seeing the FULL Bushido 9 fight card. Instead, buy all the dvds in the set individually. I'm going back now and purchasing Bushido 9 for a second time (to get the full fight card) and I'm not very happy about it."
3,Echoes of Sense & Sensibility,"Here's the basic set-up: Two sisters, parents both dead. Elder sister (Margaret) is selfless & dutiful, younger sister (Prue) is self-absorbed, and foolishly in love with a worthless young man (Freddy). Margaret falls in love with a man (Talbot) who is thought to be having an affair with a hedonistic older married woman. Freddy asks Prue to marry him but doesn't want to tell his aunt or anyone else (other than Margaret), and is in no hurry to set a date. Margaret resists her feelings, Prue nourishes hers... rewards and punishments ensue in the Victorian fashion. Quite well-written & absorbing, though certainly not in the same league as the earlier Jane Austen novel it seems to be inspired by."
5,Great kitty box!,"I love this box, it is the best invention as it never leaks and all you need to do is clean it out every day. Not a good product if you are not going to use clumping litter. Otherwise, just clean out each day and you can keep this box for 4-6 weeks. Then you just throw it away and replace it with a new box. No more cleaning or scrubbing litter boxes!My only complaint was the shipping cost from Amazon. Cost more than the boxes themselves and because of this, sadly I will never order this product from Amazon again."
5,Good for travel,"I bought this to put in my cat's crate while she flew to our new house. It was a good size for this. For a temporary litter box, it's very solid."
4,kitty litters,The kitty litters have lasted for more than a month each with little wear showing thus far. I have two in the house and one in the office. They are the right size for a kitten and I would buy them again.
5,Kitty litter wonderbox,The jumbo litter wonderbox is great. This box works well for multiple cats. I like using the wonderbox because it doesn't have the odor like the regular litterboxes.
5,Jumbo Kitty Box,"With 2 Maine Coon cats in our household these large disposable litter boxes are ideal. They are durable, easy to clean and easy to dispose of. I will definitely buy these again."
1,Litter litter everywhere.....,"These smaller litter boxes are just too short. The smaller boxes should have a smaller ""footprint"" but have sides ashigh as the jumbo ones. I used one jumbo and three smaller ones and each smaller one distributes litter everywhere around it. When you use less litter because of this everything sticks. I guess the folks who designed this size have never owned cats who used a litter box. I hope they redesign, I like being able to toss them when done."
2,seemed like a good idea...,"I've tried every type of litter box liner that's out there and this one just really made a lot of sense to me. My intent was to hopefully only have to change it every 4 weeks or so, but within 2 weeks it already gets pretty saturated with urine even though the amount of litter in it is pretty high, so you still get that great cat urine smell (gag!). Even still, it's the least messy of all that I've used, and I'm on the plan where they automatically send it to me every several weeks, so it's fairly economical doing that."
5,Changed my life..,"The wonderbox is phenomenal. I have two cats and I use it with feline pine and the house NEVER smells like cat urine. People even comment when they come over that it doesn't smell like I have cats (and I live in a small two-bedroom apartment). I highly recommend the wonderbox. It has literally changed my life, my house smells so much better, and they are so easy. I put them in the larger plastic litter box (to keep litter off the floor), only need to scoop poop, and then every week or so I just dump the box and put in a new one. Honestly, you could probably empty the litter and use it the box twice (I've done that in a pinch) and it works great, and no urine smell. Love it!!!!"
4,great for travel,"These litter boxes are (almost) perfect for car travel. They are sturdy enough to be used without a plastic litter box around it, and when you leave a hotel room after a few days, you leave it and the mess behind. Nothing to clean. My car is large enough so I even left it out during the trip, and the car didn't smell.My cat seems to love the texture, which leads to why this product only has 4 stars - it's just a little too small for large cats. He had so much fun playing with the litter, he kept kicking it outside the box. If these boxes were larger, I'd use them instead of the plastic boxes any day, and I'd give the product 5 stars. There is a jumbo size, but you only get one for a dollar more than you get three of these. That puts it out of the disposable range for me."
3,Not as big as you think,The idea that these are disposable is great but the measurements given in the description are not correct. The box is not as wide as is stated.
5,Fantastic product and truly worth the money,"This is a fantastic product! Our elderly cat (now 21) has used these litter boxes for years. Older cats produce a lot of urine, and we were having to replace the disposable plastic litter box liner practically every day to keep the odor down. Using the Kitty's WonderBox means no more expensive plastic liners, NO ODOR, and we can scoop or dump out the litter and still use the same box for a week or more. It's amazing. These boxes also work great for cats who shred the disposable liners by kicking or trying to bury things, etc. The boxes are virtually indestructable. I'd recommend them for any cat."
4,Good temporary litter box,"I was looking for a low profile litter box to start some orphaned kittens off on, and the cut out at the front of this box made it perfect for the little ones to easily climb in.I personally would not want to spend the money to use these disposable boxes on a regular basis, I have no issue with occasionally scrubbing out the plastic ones, but for a person who is lazy or rich, they would be great for regular use."
2,"wanted to like this, but . . .","The ""jumbo"" size did not match our ""XLarge"" litter box, despite the ""equal"" dimensions. Also, it seemed to augment rather than abate the urine smell, perhaps because we have 3 cats. But after about a week, it was nasty and had to be changed. Have gone back to just a plastic litter box with far less smell."
1,"Does Nothing! And NOT ""Jumbo""","First of all, this is NOT a ""jumbo"" box. It stands ONLY 7"" high, so when the cat buries her waste, much of the litter gets scraped OUT of the box and onto the floor. And let me tell you, the smell of urine drenched kitty litter on a hardwood floor is nauseating. My whole house stinks!Second, the box does NOT mask odors ... as I sit here typing this review, I'm about to suffocate .. because if the cat doesn't pee in the litter, but pees on the box, the ODOR is stifling!Total waste of money."
2,hmmmm,"Didn't work so great for me. Clumping litter seemed to just stay wet and would not really ""clump"" inside this box and it seemed much harder to scoop as it would stick to the bottom & sides. I've gone back to plastic now and it's working out better."
5,More durable than it looks,"I was skeptical about this ""disposable"" litter box at first. It is made of textured egg carton-type cardboard material. The reason I purchased it is because I have one corner in my bedroom that my cats kept marking. No matter what I tried to clean the carpet with, they must have been able to detect the scent because every cat I've had (I rescue strays) has marked that same corner. I purchased the WonderBox and filled it regular, non-clumping clay litter and placed it in the problem corner. My cats have been using it for about 2 weeks now and it has not leaked through at all despite my using cheap non-clumping litter. It's been two weeks of 7 cats using it and it is still holding up just fine. I will probably replace it after a month or so, just as a sanitary precaution, but overall, I am very impressed with the product. I bought a medium sized WonderBox from my local chain grocery store for $3.99, so be careful of cost when ordering online."
2,"Okay for winter time, but....","These boxes are okay for winter time use. They really don't eliminate odor very much. They are too small for my cats and I can't afford to purchase six of the super size each month. I find that these boxes hold odors and I clean out all six of them daily. I have to go to the expense of buying both a powdered litter box deodorizer and a spray type one to control the odors. I will try something else I think. During the spring, summer and early autumn months I can empty the regular litter boxes and take them outside to scrub and rinse with the garden hose. I am disappointed that these boxes don't work as well as claimed."
3,Only one box for $12.99? Seriously?,I buy the medium sized boxes in a pack of 3 here in town for $11.99 so I thought that $12.99 for a jumbo box would mean two of them. WRONG! $12.99 for one box. I'm sending it back. I've used Kitty's Wonderbox for years but I will not pay this much for one box. Even at the subscription price it's too much. This one doesn't even have the baking soda. The ones I buy at the pet store have it and come at a decent price. I'm beyond disappointed. I'm mad.
3,I didn't love it,"The wonderbox is convenient for a short trip when you need a temporary litter box, but I wouldn't recommend it for long term use. My cats liked to scratch it constantly and then tracked little white bits around the apartment. It does seem to absorb odors pretty well and does not leak, but it is hard to scoop. When the litter clumps, it seems to stick to the walls of the box making the box only last about a month (in my case)."
2,Not for chewers!,"We bought this 3-pack of litter boxes for our new kitten (11 weeks old when we got him). The size of the box is fine for a small cat (probably too small for a full-grown cat, though). However, the sides are pretty low, allowing our kitten to fling litter everywhere.The reason I'm giving this only 2 stars, though, is that it does not hold up to chewing at all. Our kitten managed to chew off a small flake of the edge of the box one day and from then on, decided that chewing pieces of the box, dropping them into the litter and diving for them (flinging litter in the process) is the best game ever. We seriously couldn't keep him out of the box, and the more he chewed at the sides, the easier it was to break off large chunks. We had to switch to a plastic box because he was making such a mess.Maybe this would work for calm, older cats, but it's just about the worst thing for curious kittens."
4,Easy,These were easy to have during my travel and trip with my cat. I like the fact that they are very odor absorbant and I can simply throw them out when done.
2,Unnecessary pirate reissue,"This is an unnecessary (but legal) pirate issue of the original 1953 Transradio/Lehrer Records studio recordings of the first set of songs. If you must have these original studio recordings (instead of what I feel are the superior concert recordings with intros and audience reactions) you would be much better off with getting a copy of the authorized reissue on Rhino/WEA ""Songs and More Songs by Tom Lehrer"". Only slightly more expensive, it contains BOTH sets of songs (although Rhino didn't use the stereo master tape that exists of the studio recordings of the second set of songs.) The Rhino CD also contains the four recordings Lehrer made with an orchestral accompaniment and his recently recorded ""missing"" song ""I Got It From Agnes""."
5,R.L Stine beware of this up-and-coming writer,"It's like nothing I've ever read before. I picked up a copy of ""Echoes of the Strange"" for my son after seeing it recommended by a reliable source. I was surprised to find myself enjoying the four stories as much as my son. They were, quite simply, genius. Ms. Heather Beck writes with an intriguing style to create a world of unbound possibilities, magnificent beauty, and sheer pleasure. Beck's style is truly unique. In my opinion, she has crafted to perfection what R.L. Stine has desired to do."
5,great basic faucet,"This was fairly easy to install and it does look nice in the bathroom. It's a basic no frills faucet, but certainly does the trick. It's also a low flow faucet, so if going green means anything to you, this might even surpass your expectations."
5,great quality,"I bought this faucet back in June of 2007 for twenty dollars and it has held up very well. It has not discolored at all, even with our hard water. It still looks shiny and new. Install was quick and simple, especially for being the first faucet we ever installed ourselves. Highly recommended if you just want (a cheap) basic faucet."
2,The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,"The reader did not do very good. He was not very expressive,very monotone.His diction was subpar.I am refering to the auto version of this book From Edwards Publishing House.The book its self is a masterpiece of course."
1,Ragh,"I guess the best part of getting this was that it was totally free.No wonder why it's free, though..."
4,Great read - free to boot!,"I really enjoyed the stories in this classic. The stories are easy to read, and most can be done in a lunch hour, which is what I found myself doing.I did find some font issues in the text, mostly where is seems to have been the symbols for British currency, but other than that, the read was seamless."
5,"It's free and it's a classic, how can you go wrong?",A great collection of short stories that are enjoyable even if they show their age. Don't expect the intricacies and plot twists of modern story tellers as the stories are generally straight forward and to the point.I enjoyed the stories in this book but some readers may be surprised at their simplicity given the many t.v. and film adaptations of the characters.
4,Sherlock,Sure. I'm a devoted reader of yore. I enjoyed the various chapters of Sherlock Holmes. Recommend it and many other Kindle lenders.
3,Nice,Very good classic book for Sherlock Holmes. I love a good puzzle. Would recommend to any one who likes Holmes.
3,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"This book seems like it would be great for a smaller child to read. It shortens the stories a lot and changes the dialogue to make it easier to understand. However, when I bought this I was under the impression that it would be the full story, not just summaries."
2,This title is not available for customers from your location in: Asia & Pacific,Too Bad.This title is not available for customers from your location in:Asia & PacificI wish Amazon freeing the zone. so all user can get the benefit of the internet and globalization.also Kindle Fire must be available and sold to outside US. and can utilize all the kindle fire benefits when used outside US
5,Great stories!,I love the short stories in this book. It's fun to pick up and read just about anywhere. Very entertaining and action packed!
5,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes MP3 CD,"This is very well read and enjoyable. It's good to have all the stories on one disc as I listen to them in bed after I turn the light out. The only crit I have is that there's no index to tell you what order the stories are in, but if you know Sherlock well you'll realise they're in the same order as in the book. Much recommended and I look forward to getting more in this series."
5,very very good,"The book is very interesting. It holds your interest. It would be easy to think it would not be a book for these times, but it is as good today as years ago."
4,very good short stories,"Very good short stories that can you can read in a little time. That makes each storie a little book in there own, good stories."
4,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"Well executed, a tale a minute. Good old fashioned who-done-it. Couple of tales repetitious, for me. Excellent intoduction for the uninitiated."
3,It's Elementary - My Good Man,I gave this a three star. If you love Sherlock Holmes and the banter back and forth with Dr. Watson. It is good
3,"Great stories, the quality is not that good.","Loved being able to read the stories again. However, the illustrations were wonky. They graphics would show up wrongly on the page or superimposed over the text."
3,Kindle Purchase,"Purchased this when I had a Kindle and enjoyed reading it. I have since gone to the ""other"" side and have not reloaded this into my Kindle app."
4,I have it when I want it.,You can never have too many classic books in your e-library and you certainly can't beat the price. Free is nice.
5,"Elementary, my dear reader.","I have been an avid fan of Holmes and Watson since I was a teen. Re-reading these excellent stories reminds me of why Conan Doyle is still read, even in this century. Unlike Christie, his writings have held up over time (sorry Christie fans).Conan Doyle was a doctor in real life and it is obvious that an intelligent mind crafted these. Besides, the Kindle version is free. Enjoy these stories from a bygone era."
5,wonderful!,Sherlock Holmes is very well written and I totally love the Kindle App for my phone. I can read anywhere and at any time!
4,"Good, but what's the big deal","Numerical corruption and 140 year old english aside, this is a pretty good book, but I prefer my crime mysteries to present the facts so that I might be able to solve it as well. Sherlock Holmes would be much more a hero in my mind if all of the evidence was presented, and yet it was still difficult to solve the issue at hand.An entertaining read, nonetheless."
4,"It's taken me months to read this book, but not because it's bad","...but because it's the perfect kind of book to spend a lot of time reading. As a series of short mysteries this book is perfect to set on the bedside stand or have in the bag when I'm out traveling. I can pick it up, spend some time reading a great short mystery involving the world class Holmes and written by the world class Doyle. I don't get bogged down by long, drawn out or overly complex and detailed plots. Just the facts and what inevitably seems to be a simple solution. But I did learn that the reason the reader can so often not come up with the solution is because frequently Holmes has observed or come across some piece of information that has not been previously made known to the reader until he unveils his ""whodunit"" theory. Always correct, of course. All in all a fun read."
4,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes--A Great Adventure,"I rate this book 4 stars because it reel you in on a hook and it will not let go until you have read the whole thing. Its a keeper any person thats read it would say. It on the egde, exciting, and most of all it is very clever. Did I tell you that it is also Adventurous.The book is about two main people. One is the great Sherlock Holmes and his ever faithful Dr. Watson. They go on Adventures together and make there murder look like a fool for even thing to fool the great team.A quick example from the book is a evil uncle and two women in the house that the woman own. One day one woman was found dead and the local law enforcement had no clue until the great team of Sherlock and Watson were on the case. ...That is just one of the many stories told. So if you want a fast pace book. Read The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."
5,nice book,"This is an exciting collection of Sherlock Holmes stories. I personally like the ilustrtations,it helps me to get the whole picture of the story."
4,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,Great read. It's wonderful to immerse yourself in the past and take a back seat to the machinations of the master.
3,Faded Pictures,This edition reprints some of the original illustrations - unfortunately they are badly faded and difficult to make out. Otherwise this book seems fine.
4,Fun...,Good when you want a diversion for a few minutes... read a chapter and try to guess the ending. Characters believable; adventures well written.
4,Excellent,"I had never read Sherlock Holmes before and this is a great collection of a few of the tales/adventures. I found them to be interested and fun to read, and because of this I purchased the complete adventures/stories for kindle (it is a dollar or two and has so much more content)."
5,Big Fan,"I'm only on page 20 or so, but I'm already loving this book. Very well written (obviously) and I've been dragged into a great story very early in the book, so hooray!"
4,Still the best short mysteries,A great freebie to keep on the kindle for when you've overspent your budget and still want something to read. You don't have to read the full book - each short mystery is self contained but you learn more about the characters as you read more of the stories. Especially enjoyable if you have recently seen the blockbuster movie. You will be surprised how much of the movie details are in the stories.
5,Ordered for school,I ordered this book @the last min 4 my sons summmer reading project. It arrived very fast & in new condition as listed! He also liked reading the book!
1,to be or not to be (free!),"I love the book, the rating is not for the quality of the stories.However this, and many other kindle books, are advertised as ""free"" and then when I get to the actual buying page it shows a price - sure, its cheap, $3 or less, but that is not free.One of the reasons I was considering getting a kindle was the huge quantity of ""free"" classics, but as it turns out most of them aren't. At least not for international customers.So no kindle for me. If I have to pay for these books, I'll keep buying them in paper."
4,Review,Good book. Too tired. To say 18 words want to show 100 per centWanda Lee is finished. CotWanda in out
4,Classic,Read every short story and was surprised at the ending. Well written. Good Characterization. Imaginative. I would recommend this book and might re-read.
3,Good book,It was okay. I have seen better movies. It just doesn't translate well to print. Still if you know nothing of Holmes it's a good place to start.
5,Great book. Great value. Great Choice.,"This review is for the kindle edition of ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.""I found this ebook to be a great download (my first one actually). It does have an active ""table of contents"" that has worked well on my Kindle 3. The only problem I have noticed is that every once-in-awhile a typo crops up.This collection of Sherlock Holmes short stories make for quick but highly enjoyable reads. Perfect for a relaxing lunch hour or a half-hour sanity break during a long day. Each adventure is very much to the point yet gives little glimpses into the life and character of Holmes and Doctor Watson. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle adds a lot of color within a less-is-more framework that I really admire.I highly recommend this ebook!"
5,Excellent,"Timmons does a first rate job of reading, word for word, these classic texts. He does different character voices and he's consistent over the entire work. Amazing that it took him ten years to read it all. Also amazing that in ""A Scandal In Bohemia,"" I thought I was hearing things when Timmons would read a line, then immediately repeat it with a slightly different inflection. Finally I realized that he didn't like his first try and redid the line, but whoever was in charge of editing forgot to cut it out!I highly recommend this set to anyone who likes audio books. You get word-for-word Doyle, which the BBC productions don't give, while getting a highly skilled performer entertaining you."
4,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"A mysterious photograph. A disappearing company. A man with two identities. All this and more in the book, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. This book includes puzzling mysteries such as The Case of Identity, in which a husband suddenly disappears, and A Scandal in Bohemia, in which a king tries to steal a photo, but needs Sherlock Holmes' help. This book is suitable for all people ages 10 to adult. It's puzzling and complex, yet adventuresome and amusing, able to catch all readers' eyes. Unfortunately, the book does have some boring parts, but its captivating stories and perplexing mysteries more than make up for this. Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes team up together once again and form what may be one of the best detective book yet, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes."
1,Terrible,"I did not purchase this Kindle book because the sample that I asked for, and read, is awful. The following is one sentence: ""Ihad seen little ofH olm eslately.M y m arriage had drifted usaw ay from each other."" Clearly the conversion into Kindle format did not work well."
1,Incomplete and with poor formatting!,"I had finished reading this edition before I realized it was incomplete. The Bedford Park editionThe Complete Sherlock Holmes Collection, with attractive cover illustration of London Bridge, is a much better edition overall, with proper formatting of numbers, and contains all of the Sherlock Holmes stories and novels.It was extremely annoying to encounter strange symbols every time a number is mentioned, and to be forced to decipher badly-formatted html to figure out what number was being stated. Also, a variety of line breaks in the wrong places were very frustrating.This edition is simply not worth trying to save $0.99."
3,misspelled words,"I had trouble downloading book to kindle and it loaded without bookcover . There are a number of words in the download version that have this ""#%$^&*(()*%##@"" instead of letters, but as it is free I will live with it."
3,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,"Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes are good combi. The reader cannot always predict the end at the beginning, although sometimes we can, which is the exciting part of detective story, as new evidences come out one after another on the way to come to the conclusion."
4,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (Illustrated),"This is such a nice text, not only because it introduces great mystery stories but fantastic images. These kinds of stories were, are and will be for developing a critical, reflective and smart reading."
4,"Great stories, split pictures","This is one of the first books I've read on my new Kindle. I love the portability and how easy it is to read in daylight. My favorite feature is that I have an automatic bookmark (unless I accidentally press the back or forward buttons too long).Sherlock Homes is a classic, and the pictures are impressive. My Kindle has a tendency to show two images, the second overlapping the one beneath slightly. I can see the entire picture with a strip of the top repeated above. Not a big problem, but it does look messy. I can live with it as a free book, but it does bring my overall review down to a 4."
5,Nothing better than Holmes,"If you've never read THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, this is your chance. I was able to get this volume for free and, if it's still free, you need to download it NOW.My nephew had never read Conan Doyle and struggled with this at the beginning but he's now a Holmes-fanatic. Give yourself a few pages and I think you'll become a fan, too. It really is that good."
5,Beautiful Illustrations,"Nothing more needs to be said about the characters, stories and beautiful writing here, but I'd like to say that Paget's illustrations add so much to the book, even in Kindle. A joy to read."
5,I am a fan of the detective...,"I have read many different books about Mr. Holmes and I always enjoy each one. Since I read for the pure enjoyment of it, I try not to be too critical. It has to be a real yawner for me to speak badly of it."
3,Kindle Sherlock,I've read and enjoyed all of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The Kindle edition is handy for a quick reread. It's still as Doyle wrote it;.
5,Adventures of Sherlock Holms(Illustrated),This book is among one of the best that I will enjoy reading again and again. I will bring it with my Kindle where ever I go. Thanks Amazon.com for creating such a wonderful product with such a low price. Having a Kindle just changes the way I read and makes all the books much easier to carry.
4,Sherlock Holmes,The Kindle book downloaded quickly and the short stories are extremely good. Like both the Kindle and inexpensive books available from Amazon.
3,No frills packaging of classic tales,"I won't bother reviewing Arthur Conan Doyle's classic Sherlock Holmes stories, which feature one of the most popular and enduring characters in the world.Since most readers are at least a little familiar with the work, I'll focus on the package. This collection showcases 12 of the better Holmes stories, and, like many other collections, it begins with ""A Scandal in Bohemia."" Strangely, the editors have chosen to end with ""The Adventure of the Copper Beeches."" This goes against the grain of most collections, which finish with ""The Final Adventure."" I would call that a bad editing choice.The introduction by Mr. Lowndes is a brief, serviceable and well-written overview of how Sherlock Holmes came to be a cultural phenomenon.There are certainly better collections out there, but this will serve well as an introduction to the character in some of his finer moments."
3,Not an audiobook!,"I purchased this ""audiobook"" for my Kindle Fire and found out it is NOT an audio book! However, it is Sherlock Holmes after all, and for that reason, if you enjoy Sherlock Holmes mysteries, you will enjoy it."
2,Can't get to the audiobook w/o a computer,"If you want this for only the written book, great. But if you want to get the audio book, as I did on a trip recently, note that you must receive the audio files in a zipped format, and then unzip them before they can be put on a smart phone to be listened to as you travel. I bought this before starting out on a trip, and then when I tried to start to listen to the audio part during my trip, I found out it is not available without going to my computer and unzipping the files and then putting them on my phone.Bottom line: long trip, no audiobook."
2,Flawed Kindle Edition,"I rather do admit I find the English a bit boring, might I say, my Dear Watson? Perhaps it is the overabundance of words in a sentence to demonstrate intellectual superiority, my dear chap.Okay, enough of that...The Good: 12 good stories introducing Sherlock..for free.The Bad: Table of Contents, symbols, and you can get ALL of the books elsewhere for free."
5,A must-have classic. Great for book clubs.,This is a definite must-buy classic for all mystery lovers.Complete series of the most memorable adventures.I will defitely recommend this book to OnlineBookClub blogfor a group review/study chapter by chapter on blogger.
3,EASY READING OF STORIES ABOUT WHICH I WAS UNFAMILIAR,"THE MYSTERIES ARE SHORT AND EASY TO COMPLETE JUST BEFORE BEDTIME. TIRED OF THE ""NEW SHERLOCK HOLMES"" WE SEE IN MOVIES, ETC SO ENJOYING READING THE REAL MCCOY,"
4,Present Set,"A bit gray as usual traditionally-British books are, this volume is a good present to pupils discovering Sherlock Holmes' stories."
5,One of the best books ever put together!,I had a hard time putting this book down! I really enjoyed these stories starring Holmes and Watson. I would strongly recommend this book to others.
3,An obvious mystery,This book was o.k. but the mysteries were too obvious. The author gave it away on the second page of every story. My favorite character was Watson. He never knew what the answer to the mysteries were until Holmes figured it out.I would recommend this book to kids ages seven - nine.
3,Short stories for short attention spans,"Bonus points to The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for being a free kindle book and for being one of the greatest firsts of its kind. That being said, the quality of the book is not quiet as ""timeless"" as I had hoped. I read Sherlock Holmes right after finishing Treasure Island and before that, Around the World in 80 Days. Needless to say, these other ""classics"" I had picked up were more impressive than I could have imagined and easily hold their own to anything written in modern adventure/thriller novels. I wish the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes gave the readers a little more freedom to venture other possible solutions and to really stir the imagination but, sadly, it does not."
1,No Purchase,"This item was not purchased. Please determine how purchase made, item not held or accounted for by indicated purchaser/acct holder"
1,Sherlock Holmes Genre Destroyer,"Sherlock Holmes should have been banned from the author's mind as soon as he saw a scribbled hard copy of him at his writing desk. All this running to and fro across an entirely dead city (Henry the VIII lived it, destroyed it), landmarks built on sand and the facile plots and twists that quite nearly killed the genre. As for Holmes, as for Doyle, the former needs his Private Investigatory License stripped, and pharmaceutical card, the latter needs to lose the ""Sir.""Chris Roberts"
5,Classic whodunnit,"This is the collection immediately following Holmes' return after Moriarty dragged him to his death over those falls in ""The Final Problem"". At the beginning of the first story, Holmes returns and explains his miraculous escape to Watson, and of course begs his forgiveness! Then it's back to the plot. With tales such as the Dancing Men, the Six Napoleons, and the Golden Pince-Nez, this is Doyle at his typical best. Well worth a read, if only to discover who really done it!"
4,Sherlock Holmes for Kindle,"What can you say, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the definative writer of Sherlock Holmes stories. Many have copied him but few come close to the master. And now its free on the Kindle.."
5,Phenomenal stories of the great Sherlock Holmes,"After seeing the second movie featuring Robert Downey Jr I wanted to read all the original stories of Sherlock Holmes, at first I was a little disappointed that the two characters weren't the same but after a while I preferred the one in these books. All the stories in this version (and future ones as well) are amazing, I have since continued on to other stories featuring Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. Watson.Reading this book was a pleasure."
4,Poor quality control of the digital text.,"Great classic stories. My only complaint is that periodically a word will be completely garbled and be unreradable, leaving the reader guessing as to what it is. I do not know why this occurs and would think the publisher would proof read the digitial text before releasing it. Poor quality control."
2,Great book - poor conversion to digital,"These are truely wonderful stories and I'm so glad that amazon is making so many classic public domain books easily available through their website; however, they may need a little more work on the digital formatting.Many non-standard (to the U.S.) symbols, such as the """" and French words like ""voilà"" come across as scrambled computer code such as:'¿Also, the table of contents is not active.I have had better luck downloading these public domain books from Project Gutenberg."
4,Sherlock Holmes,I think this is a really good book but they should translate the money amounts so that they are understandable
4,Classic reader,Excellent. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. The classics cannot be overlooked. I hope young people will try it.
5,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,I like a good mystery and the way he figures out what has happened. He is a very observant man.
5,Excellent as any Sherlock Holmes quest should be,"This is excellent reading for the avid Holmes fan! However,there are some stories with overlapping points and plots. Still the Holmes fan will not be disappointed and may gain insight into the background of a sleuth who may only be known to them through recent film."
3,What can I say?,It was written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He is one of the best witers of modern times. i love a really good mystery and this is one of the best.
5,Sherlock Holmes,I loved the book on my new Kendle. It was a great free book. I plan on getting many more soon.
5,Always good!,Sherlock Holmes and Watsons adventures are always very interesting and detailed. The mysteries will keep the pages turning and time passing for hours!
2,Poor editing,"I enjoy reading the Sherlock Holmes stories, and bought this to have permanantly in my Kindle. The problem is that on practically every page there are typo's. It just becomes annoying after a while to read and try to interpret what is written because of the constant typo's. Very poor editing by whomever did this."
2,"Description is off, better value elsewhere.","The description mentiones an audioplay performance, as well as a luxury oxford edition, neither of which are included here.While these stories are obviously deserved classics, this is just one of five short story collections and 4 novels published by Arthur Conan Doyle. Elsewhere on the Kindle store, for the same price you can get the entire collection, all 4 novels plus all 5 short story collections, under the name Sherlock Holmes Complete Collection."
4,Great Entertainment,Entertaining collection of Sherlock Holmes vignettes from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Each chapter challenges the reader to solve the crime before Holmes but the reader sometimes finds themselves in Watson's shoes trying to figure out where Holmes got his answers. Well worth the read.
4,Classic,"This is a time honored classic that I never got to read...until now. It was a very good read and very entertaining. Of course, while reading through the book I was hearing the voice of Basil Rathbone in the back ground. (the original Sherlock Holmes for me, not Robert Downey Jr.) I love a good mystery and these stories were great. Get in touch with your classics and add this one to your list."
4,Where's Paul?,Just curious if anyone knows why the Wings song is left off of all these soundtracks? Is that song available anywhere? Thx.
5,TWTWTW,"I watched the tv show when I was in college. The Vatican Rag is a classic not to mention NEW MATH.He tells it as it was,"
5,That Was the Year That Was,"This is a superb collection of Tom Lehrer's most memorable songs: funny and smart, sparing none and satirizing all."
3,A True Relic,"It should be noted that the year of the title ""That Was the Year That Was"" is 1965. Given that Tom Lehrer was the forerunner of political satirist Mark Russel (both play the piano and crack political jokes) you can rest assured the the humor on this album is VERY dated. Nervertheless, Lehrer has an easygoing style and if you remember the historical references, the jokes are quite funny (for example, Lehrer's amusing remark about Massachusettes having THREE Senators refers to the then-still living Bobby Kennedy serving a Senator from New York). Some of the people Lehrer jokes about, like California Senator George Murphy, are virtually forgotten today, while topis like World War Three war songs (""So Long Mom"") have faded from significance.Overall, a true relic that will probably be of most interest to cultural historians."
5,Songs from the TV Show,"I'm amazed that none of the reviews for Prof. Leher's ""That Was The Year That Was"" have mentioned that this compilation is derived from his contributions to the early 60's television show of the same name or that the good doctor is alive and well and teaching mathematics in a prestigeous California university. My vinyl copy is well worn and the CD brings back the clarity."
2,"For a few months, a decent mouse","This GE wired optical mouse worked fine for a few months. It was much nicer than the old non-optical mouse it replaced, although it's your basic mouse. The motion was good, and the wheel and buttons worked fine for a while.However, after three or four months, almost every click started registering as a double click in Windows. I found that if I held the button down for half a second, I could usually, but not always, get it to single-click. But it was too inconvenient to have to think about every click. I replaced the GE mouse with aMicrosoft optical mouse, and everything is happy again.This mouse is priced cheaply, but it is also made cheaply. I rate it two stars instead of one because it worked so nicely for a while and was priced right."
1,Left mouse button stopped working regularly after 1 month of use,"Purchased last month at Target, and already the left button works inconsistently. If I hold it down the click goes through, but I nearly always have to hold the button down."
2,Temporary Mouse,"You should only buy this thing if you only need a mouse for about a month or two. This thing actually works pretty awesome while it lasts. The scroll wheel is also very quiet, which is a bonus. However, there is a reason it costs so little. It stopped working today, only a month or so after the purchase. I found that by applying pressure where it plugs into the USB, the red light at the bottom lights up again and it works. Unfortunately we don't care to hold and apply pressure to a USB port the entire time on the computer.You should especially avoid this mouse if you are someone who uses a mouse for a laptop and have to plug and unplug. We only plugged and unplugged several times and it died. I hope to actually find a mouse that is durable. If you know of one, let me know. I am not even sure if I can trust the expensive ones."
3,Not great; not bad,"Attractive and ergonomic product. Appears to have some accuracy issues with respect to click speed, but this may just be a matter of further adjustment. Very good price."
2,"poor quality, the worst",such a poor recording. music is so low it's hard to hear. tried it on 3 different systems so it's not my equipment. love these old songs but very very poor recording.
4,Not up to the usualy quality for Audio Fidelity,"Kevin Gray mastered this one and it sounds inferior to the common cd.Very disappointed.**************Update: I'll bump this up to 4 stars and like to explain why.This disk is HDCD enabled. IMO, you really need a player that can read HDCD properly to enjoy this disk.I recently bought an OPPO bdp-93 and now, I think this cd does sound better than the common one.That's probably true for most enabled HDCD discs."
2,not my cup of tea,"This may have been well recieved and critically acclaimed, but it just hasn't reached out and grabbed me. The remaster is great, terrific sound quality, but the music itself just wasn't for me."
5,the show was cool,Lynda Carter is still One of the Finest Ladies that I have ever seen&she is still so foxy.the show was cool in a reverse of SuperMan.the Duel Roles&Persona's.alot of fun&some cool action scenes through out.
5,"YES YES YES!(...) Go DIANA, Amazon Princess!(...)","It's about time!(...) I can already give this collection 5 stras!(...) Lynda Carter IS WONDER WOMAN!(...) Ans season ONE ROCKS!(...) My favorite WW episodes are these of the first season!(...) The 1942/WW II setting with Diana Prince as a U.S. Navy Wave is AWESOME!(...) This will be my all-time FAVORITE T.V. series collection on DVD!(...) Seasone 2 ROCKS as well, so let's get Season 2 out soon too, Warner Brothers! So COOL!(...) AWESOME!(...)"
3,I loved Wonder Woman But hated Season 1 Era 1940's & suit,"Season 1 was the start of a good TV series... Although Season 1 (14 Episodes Thank Heavens) I didn't care for the suit, and I thought the 1940's was portrayed as boring here. I enjoyed Season 2-4 the most, so they get a higher rating. I also had a crush on Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman as a kid. ABC did well hiring this Beauty Queen. And she's still beautiful in her older age. When I heard the rumors that she suffered from being an alcoholic, I was sad and hoped it wasn't true. Even after this supposedly rumor, she seems to be doing very well and very beautiful for her age.Lynda Carter.........................Diana Prince / Wonder WomanLyle Waggoner...............Steve Trevor SR. (40's) & JR. (70's)Hope this review didn't offend anyone... I didn't hate it, I bought this season, but it rated only ok by me... -JM"
2,Missing Pilot and 1st Episode,"What happened?!? The cover says that on Disc 1 Side A, we are to have the piolt and 1st episode. When you put the disc in it tells you that these two are on the revserse side. I flip it over since the others have that feature and there's nothing. I want a refund."
3,A classic superhero show,This show is the embodiment of 1970's superhero drama. It is fun and quite entertaining. Lynda Carter Is beautiful while at the same time A quite Great actress
4,classic show!,"classic show with a lot of episodes on this compilation! i like watching wonder woman's adventures and overall it's a good dose of imagination, action and a little comedy, considering of course the time period it was filmed and that it originated as a comic book."
4,Wonder Woman Season 1,"I like the episodes, however, in certain spots the image skips. A new, unopened DVD (when received) should not skip at all, especially when never used until I popped it in my machine. I don't know if manufacturer's defect or problem with my machine, but it is extremely annoying. Yet, the show is very good and hopefully I can fix the problem with the skipping. The price was right too."
5,Wonder DVD Set!!!,I've been a WW fan ever since I can remember and now my dream came true I have it on DVD! It was the first show I started taping when I was 5 y/o. The first season it's ok but the second one is the best! Looking forward to WW season 2 on March!!!
5,WHEN IS THE SECOND SEASON COMING???,"I can't wait! The Wonder Woman retrospective is wonderful and the audio comentary during the Pilot movie reveals a lot of little details and secrets about the making of the series. PLUS! Vibrant colors. It's like watching Wonder Woman for the first time all over again. If you're considering this video DON'T HESITATE! Buy it, you won't be dissapointed."
4,seeing an old friend,"I met Lynda Cater in 1992 while working at a retail business where she shopped. She was returning some hiking shoes that were a bit too small. I have to tell you that meeting her was one of my dreams come true(meeting Carol Burnett is the second). Lynda was just as pleasant as she could be. We spoke for a moment about her children and I asked if any of her old variety specials would ever be available on VHS(she said she doubted it). It's a memory I hold very dear and now that we can have our own copies of Wonder Woman on DVD, it really is like seeing an old friend again. I hope you enjoy watching as much as I will!"
2,Stay Away,"The audio and the picture on the DVD are so out of synch that it's like watching a badly dubbed kung fu movie. Furthermore, the series does not stand up to the test of time. The writers tried to blend camp humor with straight action and ended up doing neither very well. The fact that the network cancelled the series after only one season despite the fact it had the most beautiful woman on televison at the time ought to tell you how bad it was."
4,Clean fun,"Pity Wonder Woman never got married and had children. She had just about everything else, but we ""regular"" folk have joys she never had. A clean TV show, set up with cute reminders that the idea originated with a comic book, such as dialogue boxes, etc. My daughter has taken to flying her invisible jet around the yard, and some yellow twine has become her magic lasso. Hmmm...I wonder if she can use that lasso to get to the bottom of the question of who ate the last cookie?!"
5,What Can I Say?,"With all the reviews below, there's nothing really left for me to say. Wonder Woman was the greatest show of all time, and you can bet that I've pre-ordered the Second Season, already.Wonder Woman remains the greatest superheroine of all time, not to mention the longest-lasting, and in my opinion, much like Lou Ferrigno and the Hulk, no one can ever play Wonder Woman better than Lynda Carter.Buy it, you won't be sorry."
5,"U R A Wonder, Wonder Woman","THis was my FAVORITE show as a kid so I was thrilled when they released the first season on dvd. I never get tired of watching this show, I loved the extras with commentary and the special or whatever you call it on the one disc, I was a little disappointed that there were not more extras cause I like the extras on the dvds. Seeing what Lynda Carter looks like today was really neat and to hear her talk about her experience on Wonder Woman was a treat. Get this dvd if your a fan of this show-you'll be glad you did!"
3,"You're a Wonder, Wonder Woman","Corny as always, totally 70's retro, but hey sometimes you have to watch a good cornball show to have some fun. My youngest brother was totally in love with Lynda Carter at the time. What man wasn't?"
3,Wonderful memories -- Great superhero,"I don't have much to say about Wonder Woman other than I admire the look of the show, the attempt to make it look like it was playing out in a comic book. Storylines maybe don't hold up so well 30 years later but this is a good show, it's fun and that is the bottom line. I bought all 3 seasons in june, i still have yet to get thru them all, but I don't expect to die anytime soon so...Wonder Woman, just get a movie out there on her character."
5,PLEASE PUT THE SECOND SEASON OF WONDER WOMAN ON DVD!!!!!!!!!,I BOUGHT THE FIRST SEASON OF WONDER WOMAN AND I LOVED IT!!!!!!!! I WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AND I AM STILL WATCHING IT. I AM SURE THAT THE SECOND SEASON IS EVEN BETTER. PLEASE BRING THE SECOND SEASON TO DVD!!!!!!!!!!. I AM THE BIGGEST WONDER WOMAN FAN. I WAS SO UPSET WHEN THEY STOPPED AIRING WONDER WOMAN ON TV. YOU'VE JUST GOTTA RELEASE THE SECOND SEASON PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Finally the first season on dvd WOW!!!!,I have'nt received it yet i got it on pre-order but when i was a little kid i seen every show and it was love at first sight!! i would even play like i was her with my friends at school everyday Ohhh i'm thrilled!..lonnie
5,My head is going to explode!!,"I just watched the pilot episode with the commentary and I'm on cloud nine. The DVD of Wonder Woman's 1st season is excellent! If you were even the slightest fan, this is well worth the purchase. I can't wait for the 2nd and 3rd season's to be released!"
4,Lynda the 1970's,just loads of color & fun. lots of action. the beautiful 1970's. lynda carter is the most prettiest i've ever seen. also love her singing.****
3,Huw Lloyd Langton - 'Like An Arrow' (Allegro) 3 1/2 stars,"Another decent effort from charter Hawkwind member, Huw Lloyd Langton. Better than his 'Chain Reaction' CD (see my review). Best described as just straight-ahead rock. Tunes that had me sit up and take some notice were ""I Could Cry"", ""So Long Waiting"", the awesome ""Mo Man's Land"" (possibly the disc's best cut) and the toe tapping ""Take A Step"". Somewhat of a should-have."
3,Graphoanalysis beginning,A pretty good beginning book for how handwriting relates tothe writer's psychology. It could be better if it had an outline of an approach that were clearer and more analytic.Those trained in calligraphy or who use printing as part of their professional training ( mechanical drawing) seem somewhat exempt from this type of analysis.
1,Not From Original Publisher,Bad DVD quality. Not from original publisher (EROS) as indicated on associated image. Other sellers may have the original of this DVD but Planet Bollywood does not. Have bought other DVD from this sellers and those were fine. My dissatisfaction is with this specific DVDs from this specific seller.
4,Not an Idiot anymore,The book is set up in a very consise manner making it easy to find a topic when the need arises. It offers an intelligent explanation for our friends and relatives who just don't understand what sufferers of Fibromyalgia go through.Thank you Lynne Matallana for making my days more tolerable.
3,Just Another Clone,"Everyone who gets the diagnosis of Fibromyalgia wants to find out what they're up against. I know I did. I made the mistake of buying book after book and began reading them in a stack only to find out nobody said anything different than any of the other books. This one is no different. I give it 3 stars only because if it is the FIRST book someone reads, then it is informative. If it is the second book.... waste of money. It's a sad state of affairs when books get published mimicking every other book. It is a sad state of affairs when people try to soak a certain set of people dry - not an accusation against these writers/publishers, merely a general observation of Fibro books as a whole. I now advise fellow FMS patients to not waste their money on the books. Everything can be found free on the Web."
3,Very Simplistic,"I was pretty excited when I found this title since I've been trying to find a comprehensive but easy to read book on this disease. Unfortunately, this guide is a bit too basic. If you know absolutely nothing about fibromyalgia, this book may help you gain a basic understanding of the symptoms and treatments. I've been living with fibromyalgia for a few years, & I didn't learn anything new from this book. I guess it at least supported what I've been doing so the time spent reading the Idiot's Guide wasn't totally wasted."
3,okay book,"I thought it was a little simplistic for my stage in this illness, but it would be great for a newly diagnosed person. I am glad to add it to my resource library."
3,Disappointing,"I've bought books on bipolar disorder that spent less time on my mental health then this book did. The NFA's stance has always been ""antidepressants and lifestyle changes"" and this book goes right along with it. Very little info on pharmacutical options. Very basic and very disappointing."
2,Not too fond of these,"They hold against leaks okay for my daughter, but they hold all the wetness in the front of the diaper. It creates a huge bulge even when she has barely gone. I really prefer Luvs. I haven't had any leaks yet."
4,Black 'N Blue's debut,"In the long list of bands that should have been huge in the heyday of 80's metal, Black 'N Blue should be right up there at the top of the list. These guys seemingly had everything needed to be successful, but for some reason, they never reached their potential.Releasing their debut in 1984, these guys should have been at the forefront of the new pop metal wave that was smashing through in the U.S. On their debut album Black 'N Blue prove why they should have become more well known. The songs are catchy, hook-laden and hard rocking the whole way through. Songs like ""Hold On To 18"", ""Wicked Bitch"", ""School Of Hard Knocks"" and ""Action"" are all teriffic, but all the rest are decent as well.If you have never heard thee guys, or you really like anything 80's hard rock or metal, you should definitely check these guys out. The remastered sound of these albums are amazing, and it makes them essential to Black 'N Blue fans."
1,didnt fit,better know your iso's and ddt's crp's and inches and metric conversions and get ready for a NEW YORK Attitude if you should need to return it
4,Does what is says,"This is my first time into the wireless networking world. I'd consider myself pretty computer savvy. The instructions were pretty straight forward and setup took all of about 30 mins. with my network of DSL modem, 1 PC, 1 laptop, 1 Palm, and a NAS drive.I have had it installed for 2 weeks and not one problem. No dead spots in the house, or the backyard. security features are well explained and the firewall is doing its thing. I give it a 4 because I hear that it does not get along well with XBOX 360."
1,Very low quality workmanship,"I wish I could give this NO stars at all.This unit failed after just one month of service. Shipping back to the reseller was not an option because of the lack of feedback from the reseller in the first place.Investigating this unit myself, I found that the wireless card was NOT PLUGGED IN PROPERLY! I know it didn't shake loose, because it was actually secured with double sided tape! That means it LEFT THE FACTORY IMPROPERLY ASSEMBLED!After reseating the card, it seems to be working so far. Only time will tell. I am not buying anything else Linksys. If it fails again, it will be replaced with an Apple Airport Extreme Base station.***Update***After two more weeks of poor performance from this unit, it was replaced by a USED Apple Airport Extreme base station. The Apple unit has been rock-solid, requiring no further interaction - it just works.I recommend NOT BUYING THIS UNIT AT ALL. Get the Apple AIrport Extreme instead."
1,AWFUL--DO NOT BUY THIS,"It was not easy to connect, customer service was icky to deal with and then after all the work it didnt work, very very weak signal for the few minutes that it did work.NOT MAC compatible also, dont buy it either way!~"
2,Don't Buy It,"I bought the SRX200 to replace a Linksys WRT54G v. 1 because my 54g died after 4 years of stellar wireless coverage. As of March 17, 2006 the SRX200 does not work properly out-of-the-box. It came with the original release of the firmware, and when I tried to upgrade the firmware it resulted in a ""Failure"" message.After talking to a couple of Tech Support reps in India I had to decide that the product was defective. I was experiencing a massive amount of dropped packets and attenuation. One tech rep actually was trying to convince me that it was a problem with my ISP!I replaced it with a WRT54GS v.5 and it works like a charm right out-of-the-box. Until Linksys (Cisco) works the kinks out of the new MIMO boxes you should stick with the Wireless products that have been around."
1,Go back to the old router,"The horror stories about this product are true. After running a WRT54GS with a third party firmware for a couple years without problems, I'm not used to a router giving me fits. This guy has no improvement on wireless range. It enjoys nearly completely dropping connectivity while plugged in. Even after updating the firmware, I have troubles. I'm stuck with hoping for a new firmware to come out. Don't put yourself in the same situation."
1,2 DOAs... I give up!,"I was hoping that I would get lucky and not have the DOA problems that some have had with these routers. Sadly, the second one is now going back; it has the same symptoms that Linksys Tech Support worked with me on the first one that went back (gets a good IP address, but you can't ping it and the Setup program says it's not connected; this is on 2 computers, with different cables, etc!) I give up!"
2,Take 2 seems to work OK,"I bought the original version of this router. It always had some problems with the wireless connections (dropped connections, wouldn't work at all with WPA, etc.) It had the latest firmware, and I spent quite some time trying to troubleshoot the problems.I recently exchanged it for a new unit. The new one was slightly different (same part number, but the status LEDs are now on the front (skinny side) of the unit).The new one seems to work well, but it's only been one day.We will just have to see how it is in the long haul."
4,Solid router,"I purchased this router as a replacement. It installed easily and is working fine. Reception was not as good as I expected with the router lying flat, but standing it upright using the attached stand solved the problem."
2,why linksys made this ?,"Looks good on paper. IF you can get it to work, it works great. If you can't then it will lose wireless signal every 15-20 minutes. After a few weeks of using it, I had to call linksys customer support. They tried a few setting changes, but signal strength was poor. Poor is not even the correct word for it. I was sitting within 6 inches of router and signal strength was 11 mbps. When the new settings didn't work, customer support asked me when I purchased it. It was less than a month old so the advice was to return it to amazon. No packing box forced them to replace the router with new one from linksys, not amazon. Good part is return to linksys is not as faulty as this router."
