2,misapplied thinking,"I am a fan of Philip Kotler but this book misses the mark. There are some factual mistakes and errors but this is not the biggest problem. The book comes across as a frankenstein of joined together marketing theories and application from many of Kotlers other works and there seems little new here. Additionally, many of the concepts discussed, such as the BCG matrix hardly seem applicable to most professionals, particularly those working on large multi million dollar tenders such as engineers and architects. Having taught marketing at post graduate level using Kotlers text books as the core text, this work becomes even more dissappointing as it seems that there is little evidence that the authors have a solid understanding of professional services marketing as it for the professionals who practice it."
1,An academic's distorted view,"As anyone remotely involved in marketing professional services will quickly discern, this academic view bears no semblance of understanding of the unique qualities of marketing a law, accounting, or consulting firm. The authors attempt to fit professional services marketing into a framework of product marketing, resulting in irrelevant, discredited and useless concepts. Furthermore, the book is loaded with factual and conceptual mistakes. Any attempt to build a marketing structure for professionals based on this book is doomed to a vast waste of time, energy and money."
4,the best for professionalists,The best workbook for managers who want to develop the skills and knowledge in integrated communication.
1,Plastic Made-in-China Junk,"I don't know what hand-held shower heads the other reviewers in this section received, but mine was a piece of plastic junk made to look like metal. And for $50?? What a total rip. The plumbing fitting it came with was stripped and leaked. The swivel piece leaked. The valve piece was filled with some kind of dried grease that I had to dig out. And the head it self rivaled the quality of my 8-year-olds cheapest toys. Whatever you do, don't be fooled into buying this item. Mine is now in the trash, because returning it to Amazon is too much trouble."
5,Great shower head,I bought this to use in my travel traler. It turns out to be the best shower head that I ever had the pleasure of being under. The old shower heads were only able to get you wet and rinse off soap. The oxygenic bodyspa shower head has so much pressure that not only do you come out feeling clean but you feel like you been massaged all over. No need to walk over and use the campground showers anymore.
4,good for the money,"a cheap and good thing , made from plastic but it looks good , works very good (nice presure) and it 's cheap soooooooo...........!"
5,excellent,"This is my second unit, I have one in our RV. These are excellent shower heads, especially if you have low water pressure."
4,"Great Shower Head, but hose eventually leaks","Absolutely LOVE the shower head. You would never know this is energy efficient based on the power of the water. My daughter says it reminds her of a fire hose :-) Unfortunately, like other reviews I have read, after about 6 months, the hose must have punctured, and began to leak badly. I called Oxygenics who asked me to take a digital photo of the shower hose leaking and email it to them. I did this and they immediately shipped a replacement hose which arrived in less than a week. I am happy once again, but hope this hose lasts longer than the last one."
5,Great Shower Head,"I own a couple of apartments and have tried multiple shower heads for my own use and for the apartments. I keep coming back to these. Besides the money you save on water usage and hot water heating, the power you get is awesome. Other things that competitors don't have is adjustable water flow, you can have a trickle or a laser beam. Lastly, the added height you get out of this mount is great, I am an average height and find that the other mounts are not high enough to wash my hair, I end up lowering my head right below the spray, that is not a problem with this one. I write this as I am buying my third one and will continue to use these models."
2,Like being stung by a jellyfish,"The product leaked, even after liberal use of teflon tape. When I turned it on, it attacked rather than just getting me wet. I used it twice and put it away. There must be a better solution that this dog."
5,Great Showerhead,This showerhead allows me to use less hot water. It looks great and was very easy to install. I highly recommend it.
3,Not as good as the product thinks it is,"It was easy to install and the pressure of the water is strong, but I don't like how it comes out of the nozzle. It's not bad for the $$."
4,Great but a little noisey,"Quality of product is great and installation is a breeze. The pressure and water savings are my reasons for purchasing this product and I am not disappointed at all. Generates more steam and is a little noisey. Can still sing in the shower, no problem."
3,Will Not Solve World Hunger,"All,You'd think by some of the reviews that this thing would turn a trickle into a torrent. However, simply not the case.This was purchased to replace a shower-head in our apartment. We have old pipes, rusted and thus unable to project a proper amount of pressure out the head.Although this head improved our waterflow, it went from horrible to merely tepid.In sum: don't buy this to correct any deficiency in the overall plumbing. That simply will not happen."
1,do not get this item,"1. the hand held holder arrived with the ring that attaches to water pipe broken, this rendered the entire purchase useless since water was spewing everywhere.2. i decided to bypass the hand held holder since the threads on the hose matched the threads on the water pipe, the water flow was retarded. like an annoying uneven mist.i cant compare this waist of money any other type of poor investment i've ever made. what a horrible, horrible upset. to top it off,, i purchased this item at $38.00, it just dropped to $23.00.again, woe is me,, what a crappy purchase. cant imagine why there are positive reviews for this item"
3,Nothing spectacular,"I bought this unit to install in my RV. We almost always have very low water pressure where ever we camp in our RV. I read a review on a camping website about this shower head and how great it was. I was a little disappointed that it was made out of cheap plastic. It took 5 minutes to install it and then realized that there is no shutoff switch. I thought the adjustment near the base would cut the water off, but it does not. I tried a little too hard to turn the adjustment and turned it too far and twisted it out of shape. I was able to twist it back, but thought it was built a little flimsy. We do like the water pressure though, so it did do what it is stated to do. I think the next shower head I buy though I will spend the extra money and get one that is made out of metal."
2,Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this product three months ago. It worked well and gave a great water massage. But after little more than 90 days of use, the hose fell apart at the joint and the rubber lining ruptured. This was bad enough for a $50.00 shower head, but when I called the company, ETL, in Modesto, Ca., about a replacement under their so-called lifetime warranty, I was informed that in addition to having to pay to ship the defective part back to them ($6-7), I'd also have to send them a check for $5.95 to cover their cost to ship the replacement back to me. Somehow I fail to understand where their mistake should cost me anything. Or maybe they don't think that a part that fails in three months is their mistake. So, as the title says. Buyer beware! Maybe you'll be lucky and not get a defective product and not have to depend on ETL to back their warranty. But, then, again.........."
4,Best value for the price,I received my chrome Oxygenic hand held shower head in 2 days! I installed in in 10 minutes. I appreciate the all in one package which includes the washers and water tape. The price is outstanding for the quality. It is made of the same material that my old Waterpik shower head is made of. The water spray is very invigorating. The only negative is for small size showers as the shower head extends quite a distance from the wall and one has to stand close to the opposite wall to gain the full effects of the shower when not usng the handheld feature.
4,Good Product,"Its a good product overall but I like the steel model better, which my brother has. The steel one is sturdier and probably has more/better water pressure or maybe its just the water pressure in different areas."
4,"Oxygenics BodySpa SkinCare Handheld Shower, Chrome #130-XLF25","Very good performance for low water pressure situation. It might be nice if the hose was a little longer but, other than that, no complaints."
1,Great until it wasn't.,We got this hand-held Oxygenic three years ago. We loved it until today when we tried to fix a leak. Water was squirting all over. We dismanteled it and found a hole in the part that attaches to the pipe which comes out of the wall. You can see throught the hole! This was a great shower until it the hard water here ate a hole right through the cheap pot metal it's made of.
2,Adds *some* pressure but with noise and temp reduction,"Pros=====Very attractive design (chrome)Metal hoseGood hose lengthComes with tapeCons=====> Doesn't add much pressure. I think the spray just makes it seems that way.> It makes a lot of noise. It's not irritating, it's just loud.> The water spread and aeration decreases the water temperature so you have to compensate by adding heat.> Fixed tightening points where each component meets another (hose to bracket, bracket to water pipe, etc.). Because of this, I couldn't fully tighten the bracket to the water pipe lest it remain upside down. My last shower head allowed you to fully tighten then adjust the angle without changing tightness.Overall, I would not recommend this product."
2,Not the best shower head,"This shower head didn't last very long before the metal cover over the hose fell off and the rubber tube inside it broke almost minutes after. As for its performance while it lasted... I liked the fact that it was so light the kids could use it by themselves, however, the water sprayed all over the place, and not where it was needed. If you turned down the power of the spray, the water barely trickled, if you turned it up - the force of it was so strong the shower curtain got pulled in and clung to you while you washed.The discomfort of the experience overall is making me buy a different item, even though it may spend more water."
2,"Does what it says, but.....","...if you have a tiled bathroom and it's cold, your legs and feet will FREEZE! Due to the lessor amount of water, it cools down considerably by the time it hits the floor so the shower never warms up! Needless to say, we used this once, then restored our old hand held shower head. This one goes to Goodwill!"
2,Disapointing,"Pretty disappointing product. Makes a LOT of noise ( loud rushing air sound, really annoying) and does little or nothing for water pressure. Almost no control over the actual spray of water. Just get a lot of water kind of pouring out in big soft streams. No real firmness. The first foot or so of water from the nozzle is okay but after that it just sprays everywhere with no pressure. This stayed on the shower for two days before we put our old grohe shower head back on and dumped this in the cupboard as a bad investment."
2,oxygenics handheld,The oxygenics handheld shower head does everything that the fixed mount does. It creates an oxygen rich flow of water which appears to increase the pressure and therefore make the shower more invigorating...HOWEVER the design and shape of the handheld unit makes it very difficult to get the shower to be at a desireable angle. My wife would prefer I put back the old WaterPik unit.
2,great pressure - cheap plastic part,the plastic parts will break in several months. the lifetime warranty requires that you have the original receipt and pay 10.00 s&h; for replacement parts -plus you have to ship the defective unit back at your expense. Home depot has some repair parts.or you can get a good 2.5 gpm delta for half the price of the oxygenic.
2,"Works very well for a while, poor warranty service","The Oxygenics Body Spa Handheld worked for a while and then the hose developed a leak - the chrome cover has in fact rolled off, exposing the plastic tubing.The Oxygenics customer service people claim that that the unit is only warranteed on the clogging! So much for their lifetime warranty!.The unit stopped working after about 6 months of normal use. Would strongly discourage from buying this defective product.The showerhead is probably a better choice as it has fewer moving parts and is installed in many of the larger hotels (MGM Grand in Las Vegas for instance).The good points:- when it works, the pressure of the water is really good- does leave you feeling energized- looks sleek and 'luxurious' with no visible plastic stuffThe bad points:- defective handheld units - hold on to your receipts!- bad customer service and warranty- poorly designed plastic tubing inside the unit - prone to failure and leaks"
2,"All pressure, all the time","I was looking for a good way to save water and energy (heating less water will save energy) and this Oxygenics showerhead seemed like a great way to do that. The hose is very standard and I have no complaints there. Installation was a cinch. My complaints come from the fact that my (white plastic) Oxygenics had plastic smell and the spray is not very adjustable and very intense. I'll stick with a more traditional design. There are still good water-saving showerheads with a lower GPM (gallons per minute--the amount of water you're using at any given time) rating.The Oxygenics BodySpa SkinCare showerheads are minimally adjustable and have a wide powerful spray pattern. It might make a good choice if you're into strong showers. I thought I was but, I guess I had never had such a powerful shower before and, honestly, I just could not get into it...it was just TOO strong!"
5,Everyone should have one,"I have had mine over a month now, and I am very impressed with the product. It was easy to install following the simple illustrated instructions. It took about 5 minutes max and I was taking my time. The spray is consitstent and feels very nice on the skin. It is perfectly compatible and in use with my shower filter. The prouct is nice looking, sturdy, and of good quality and in my opinion will not break unless subjected to abusive treatment. Definately one of the best investments I made so far this year. Very glad that I bought it."
2,great pressure - cheap plastic parts,When the plastic parts start breaking (after 6 months or so)you can find a lot of replacement parts at Home Depot. The lifetime warranty on this unit requires that you have the original receipt and pay 10.00 s&h; for the repair parts.Also Delta makes a nice 2.5 gpm unit for half the price and stores that carry delta carry the parts to maintain them
2,Head Unit,"After 3 showers, the head unit came apart. While simple to reassemble, I decided to replace with a different brand. Also, I did not seek a refund nor replacement, as I had discarded the unit."
3,"worked well, then failed after 1.5 years","This showerhead worked well... until it stopped working well. We purchased it because of its water-saving features and positive reviews. Earlier this year, the low-flow valve between the showerhead and the hose failed; water completely stopped coming through. Removing the valve enabled us to keep using the showerhead, but the hose near the base of the showerhead has recently sprung a leak. There is nothing that can be tightened, and the leak is getting worse each day. This was a disappointing purchase, particularly considering that we paid full list price for it two years ago."
4,Sleek but slippery,"I'm really enjoying this handheld shower head. The product was well-packaged and the instructions are good. The only thing I would change would be the shape, or texture, of the handle. It's perfectly round and slick which makes it a little unwieldy using wet hands. All in all a good product that makes getting really clean easier."
5,Oxygenics Body Spa Hand Held Shower,"Bought this shower head to replace the one in my camper. Read different reviews about it (which were all good) and decided to try it. VERY big difference between the way this shower head works and the old one. Not sure how they do it, but there is much more pressure and spray difference in this head. Definitely worth the money!"
4,Great!,"I bought this a year ago--we have a well and would have to switch shower heads about every 6 months because they would clog. This one has MUCH better pressure than any other shower head we have ever bought. However, it did clog up (which is why I gave it 4 stars)BUT it was easy to take apart and unclog it, which is fine for me--as long as I have a way to clean it--many other shower heads do not. It has worked fine--again, the pressure is great! Would definitely buy another."
1,Shower head not all wet,"The shower head does take a smaller amount of water and create stronger water flow, but there is definitely not enough water to rinse a head full of thick hair. The most aggravating part of the shower is the wind effect the shower head creates. If you are not fighting the shower head to rinse off your hair and body, you are fighting with the shower curtain because the shower head creates a wind flow that blows the curtain in on you. Constantly. The curtain would touch the shower wall if your body weren't stopping it. I do not recommend this shower head."
5,Very pleased!,"I wanted a water saving showerhead with a forceful and full spray. I decided on this after reading reviews, although some were not favorable impressed. Installation was easy, it looks nice, and gives an amazing shower. The spray is full and seems to have an abundance of water - hard to believe it's 2.5 gpm. The pressure is great and feels like a massage (much better than some of the multi-setting massage showerheads I've tried. If you don't like that much force, the comfort control works well. Some say the spray loses pressure and gets cold farther from the head. The pressure seems good to me, even 3 ft. away, and the stream cooling is much less of an issue than with my old showerhead. Rinsing is also no problem. There is a fair amount of plastic in the construction, but it seems substantial. There are no leaks, and I don't see any obvious weaknesses, although over-tightening could crack some pieces. I'll have to see about the long-term durability, but this is a great showerhead!"
3,Good until it broke...,"I purchased the white one in Feb-2010 and I liked how it worked until six months later the plastic adapter around the ball joint just snapped as I was stepping into the shower. You can replace that part with another plastic one from a hardware store for ten bucks, but that's just not right. Would be better if they made metal adapters."
4,I like ours,"It does take less water and gives more pressure. We got this for our camper and the only thig I don't like is it does not completely stop the stream when you twist the ring. We boon dock a lot so water conservation is very important. But, I think we still used less water in spite of that. I would recommend it to anyone who water the water pressure and to cut back on water use. I plan to get one for the house as well. Amazon had the best price when I bought ours."
3,nicely constructed but very loud,We purchased this hand held shower for my daughter because the water pressure in her shower is not very good so we saw this showerhead as a solution. My daughter likes it but the shower is very loud and annoying.
5,Great shower strength for a great price!,"I purchased this Oxygenics handheld shower after enjoying another model Oxygenics showerhead during a recent hotel stay. I was hopeful that it would work as well in my home, and I have NOT been disappointed. The 130-XLF25 handheld showerhead is attractive, the hose attachment is very flexible (doesn't get twisted around like my former major-brand showerhead hose did), and the force of the shower is much improved. We've had chronic problems with the water pressure in our home, and I had been searching for a showerhead that would comfortably boost the intensity of the water spray. This item has met all of my expectations and I would certainly recommend it to anyone."
3,still need decent water pressure,"My mom has this same showerhead at her place and I love the water pressure every time I visit. My shower has a low-flow head that works okay, but I got the Oxygenics one hoping to get some more pressure. There isn't much water pressure in my apartment complex but I assumed the Oxygenics could make the most of it. Nope. I tried twisting the handle to increase/decrease the flow, but could never get a constant stream. It felt like the showerhead was always on a slight pulse (like being outside in really heavy rain). I switched back to my former low-flow head. I know the Oxygenics one is great, but make sure you have enough water flow to support it. Good luck!"
1,The greatest shower ever - for 3 weeks,"This shower head provided great pressure, but after 3 weeks the once-uniform spray changed to a painful, sharp blast. Not recommended at all."
1,Shower head in the trash.,"This handheld shower was the worst purchase I had. When taking a shower it felt like i was getting sprayed with a power wash gun like what you wash with a car, so the water gets sprayed everywhere. When you adjust the amount of water coming into the nozzle, it felt like i wasn't being clean. Read the title and you know what i mean."
1,The Photo looks so much better...,"I was pretty disappointed with this product. I had recently bought a shower head by Oxygenics at Bed, Bath & Beyond, and it was super deluxe enjoyable...but it had started leaking badly round the seams, and no amount of tape will seal it...so I hunted for a replacement everywhere...Bed, Bath & Beyond says they don't carry it anymore. ;0( So, I thought this looked like the same one, but was very let down by the quality. It is light weight, cheap-feeling, and has no power at all. Not even as good as my old leaky one. Too much trouble to try and return it, so I am stuck with it. Maybe I can sell it a yard sale or something."
5,Really works!!,"I have the crappiest water pressure upstairs - this really works so I feel like I am taking a shower instead of dancing around under light raindrops. Like the adjustability, too."
3,Great Perfomance but better with the original Singer Alan Marsh,"A great live perfomance by Tokyo Blade. But it is much better if the songs are perform by the original singer Allan Marsh. In this live DVD, songs were performed by Vic Wright, which did not match Allan Marsh vocal. I'm quite frustrated because the song ""if heaven is hell"" was not in full version, because this song is the most Tokyo Blade fans wanted to hear and see on this DVD."
2,Not very warm,"This mug only keeps the drinks luke-warm at best, not at all hot. I found that this mug is thermostatically regulated. When the thermostat is on it heats with about 40 Watts of power which should be very adequate to keep drinks hot, but the thermostat cuts off too soon. No thermostat adjustment is available. Outside of the low-temperatue issue, the mug appears to be well built."
1,doesnt work,my dad had gotten me a heated mug for christmas from walmart and the bottom was cracked so i went to trade it in for a new one and they didnt have anymore so i decided on this one. well i got and number one it looked like it had been used. number 2 it never worked i dont know if the plug was broken or what was wrong but i know that my cigarette lighter in my car works so that is not the issue. so either they jsut gave me one that somebody sent back or there was something wrong with it because it definatley didnt keep my coffee any hotter
5,very nice paper,"I've bought Aitoh papers before and always been kind of disappointed. Not this time. It is so difficult to tell from the pictures what you are actually going to receive. With the shipping this ended up being expensive, but the paper is really nice, perfect weight and you can feel the fibers on both front and back. The designs are different from those I usually find and were shot through with lots of beautiful gold leaf. This isn't for every day use, but when you are looking for something a little ""extra"" special this is a good choice."
5,Masque of the Swan,"It's one of those books that you would give anything for, if the plot happened to you. You scream, laugh, cry and talk to the book. There are times you throw it away from you saying, ""why doesn't she get it? "" and there are times you must hold onto it to see what happens. I would recommend this to everyone."
4,Simple And Powerful Wisdom Through Story,"Picking this book up can be deceptive - it might be seen as a children's book, not for very young children, but rather for young adolescents. It can be read as stories from a storybook, but this storybook is a collection taken out of a larger work called Srimad Bhagavatam - a holy book from India. I said deceptive because it is not a children's book, but is far deeper. The tales are constructed to raise consciousness. This book did raise my own consciousness.The stories are well written in English, and are captivating. The book is not unlike stories taken from the Bible, but of course the characters are very different. This book is filled with wisdom, compassion, and cautionary tales.For me, it is another view of how similar the mystical underpinnings of all religions are."
5,Enjoyed reading the book!,"Amal Bhakta has done an excellent job presenting selected stories from the Bhagavatam. Each story is less than five pages long and that makes it very easy for the reader to get through the book without feeling overwhelmed by it. There is a purpose behind selecting each story and they all are very well written. The book really does provide a sense of the richness and vastness of the Indian scriptures.I read one story a day at bedtime and really looked forward to it.I'd recommend it as a ""starter"" book for anyone interested in reading the Vedic scriptures."
2,Unbelievably disjointed,"The storytelling in this movie was a mess. It felt like a screenwriter's first attempt. The timelines were difficult to discern (did one day pass, or 1 year?), the dialog was stilted, and the story melodramatic. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the beautiful cinematography."
4,Deep thoughts about history,The movie is fantastic and I really liked it. It told the story that was way back 500 years before Christ ever walked on Earth
3,entertaining but lacking Knowledge,"I'm passionate about Confucius, his life, and his work. I'm yearning to learn more and more about him. This movie was only half fulfilling. I think it had some good moments but overall I think it lacks the depth that is Confucius. I think if you know a lot about Confucius it can be quite interesting but if you don't really know much about him you will still only know the tip of the ice berg after watching this movie. You definitely finish the movie wanting more. For me, I will at least be inspired enough to read some book about him. For others it may be discouraging. I think its worth seeing one time and hopefully that doesn't stop you from learning about this great man. Its a little bit disappointing but at the same time should I really have thought I could gain thousands of years of knowledge in a 2 hour movie???"
3,Good Mask for the price,"We used this mask on a Dummy for Halloween and placed red lights behind the eyes, which worked really well. The only problem with it is that the head hole is very large, so if you were wearing it, you would almost have to use a hoodie under it...Other wise, it's okay."
3,Troma goes to School,"Greetings from Tromavile!Many years ago, I was just starting to get into Troma. I was at Suncoast purchasing ""Stuck On You"", when I saw this film. Since I was determined to become a Troma junkie, I bought it and was plesantly suprised!I guy leaves a girls school his fortune. When they come to clean it, they stay the night and death starts happening. As the body count is rising, the guts start flying!Incase this plot doesn't entice you, you'll be pleased to know that some editions of the tape contain the ""Troma System"" informercial. The informercial contains Lloyd Kaufman, Joe Flieshaker, Debbie Rochon, and all the wonderful Troma muntants!In conclusion, whether you're a Troma fan, or not, you'll find something intetesting in ""Girl School Screamers"".-Chas Kangas Jr. http://www.maxpages.com/inyourhouse"
2,Breaks Easily,"This system worked great with all of my old nintendo games, however, the games were EXTREMELY hard to eject/pull out. There is no eject button! After 1 week of play, the system inevitably broke because of this feature. I do not reccomend this system."
4,Great deal!,"So I was really wanting to go back to the old school NES, because I have so many great memories of playing for hours after school on it, playing games like Super Mario Bros. etc. But the old NES systems aren't as affordable as I would have thought. So I came to this as an alternative. The price couldn't be beat and so far it does play my favorite games. The downside is it is very sensitive. One little bump and your whole game can be ruined, and you have to start over. That's happened a couple of time to me and it sucks when you get so far too lol. But otherwise it's working and it's been a lot of fun. But it will probably only be a temporary solution until I can get a genuine NES again. :)"
2,Orginal Nes it is Not!,"This product is not made by nintendo. So don't be fooled by its false advertisement. But, it is cute and it plays nintendo games, it does have a little trouble when it comes to set up. Its very sensitive when it comes to the wire plug in. It serves its purpose, my husband wanted the old school system and he got one. But if you want the orginal gaming system, you have to pay the price. This console overall was a good buy, especially since my husband has only played it one time since I bought it. Kids and there toys. The orginal nes should only be purchased by a mature collector, this system is for anyone who wants to play the classics at a cheaper price."
4,"good, but is this an emulator?","I just received mine in the mail today. It plays the games very well, and the controllers are alot more comfortable than the original nintendo ones. I got it for the younger kids so that they could play the games without worrying if the system would work or if they had to blow on the games. That was accomplished.Problems with the system, are: as it IS compatible with the light gun, the original controllers are NOT compatible. Also not compatible is the Game Genie which leads me to beleive the software is an emulator?I would like to know if this system reads Famicom 8 bit games, but cant seem to find any information on that at all."
3,Pretty good but has some limitations,"This is supposed to be a 3rd party Nintendo replacement. In theory, it works well, as both my original controllers and my zapper worked with the controller ports. However, I had major issues with the A/V cables, they seemed to not connect correctly with my TV or my VCR. The system itself seems very flimsly, I feel like I am going to break it when I put a cartridge in. The official Nintendo top loader is much more sturdy, but this makes for a much cheaper alternative. As always though, buyer beware, as this is NOT an original or official Nintendo product."
2,Anti-entertainment,"This is a spinoff of the long-running ULTIMA series of computer games. Unfortunately, it doesn't tie close enough with Ultima mythology to please fans, while at the same time not explaining things well enough for newcomers.The main characters are all pretty unlikable. One unsympathetic protagonist is fine; four or five turns the book into an exercise in masochism.There's really very little adventuring. Most of the text is devoted to the same argument rehashed multiple times, or to long, repetitive slogs through the muddy countryside, or to calming the panicky horse yet again.Avoid this; I don't recommend it."
2,Not the greatest single as far as new songs go,"Firstly make sure to get the jewel case version of this, the cardboard version has exactly the same bsides as the jewel case release of This Distance, also it is a lot more durable.However it is a fairly pointless release, no one wants radio edits of songs just because of the f word and all the other songs are found on different albums.So my 2 stars are for the release itself, the songs are great and everyone who knows cake will have them, best off saving your money with this one."
5,Awesome Ball,"In purchasing this heavy ball for my daughter, her hands and wrists have strengthen a lot in 1 month! Which has helped to improve her setting!! Especially her back setting!!"
5,Great product on great website!,"The first one had a leak, and they sent me a replacement right away. Good product by good website. Thanks"
5,Daughter Loves It,"Bought this as a gift for my 13-yr-old. She play club ball and sets with this at home to strengthen her hands. In excellent condition and very well made, as you'd expect from Tachikara. Also received it very quickly."
5,Tachikara The Setter Volleyball,Great product for training a setter and great service in buying the product. I would recommend the product and vendor.
3,Hat Favors,Had assumed the hats would of been ribboned up from the picture advertised. Was a little dissappointed. Also beware sellars shipping costs on these small items.
3,Good flick,"This movie is a great flick It was not as good as Fritz the Cat but a very good movie. The animation and hidden meanings are amazing the creaters of this film had some great oppinions about life, politics, and society that they display in the movie. A good one to watch under the influence of alcohol or anything else...."
1,Little or no effort making this movie,This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - even for X-rated. Theanimation was poor at best and the movie itself barely deserves the Xrating save for a few scenes. The main character Willard(not Dirty Duck)is visually portrayed as a stick figure similar to animation of the 1930s.X-rated movies usually don't have good plots to begin with but this onemakes Fritz The Cat look like classic cinema.
1,What the hell?,"I got this out of curiosity... and all I can think after seeing this is... what the hell was that all about.Overall it's really just pointless and odd... and this is coming from someone that likes oddball movies like Cool World and Wizards. The animation reminds me of old cartoons that where made sometime in the 40s... mabe not... it's not that good. If you have ever seen the realy old show Crusader Rabbit you might have an idea of how the animation is... and that had the excuse of being the first animated show for TV, so the animation couldn't be good, it wasn't in the budget since TV never got that kind of money. This movie don't have that excuseBeware this buy, Friz is better, ether of them, this is just horrid all around."
1,Waste Of A DVD,This was a piece of junk. Trust me dont buy it!! Biggestt disapointment ever! If a dumb company will make a dvd of this trash why cant they make one for Howard the Duck??
1,Quite Disappointing,"I purchased this book in preparation for the AP Exam in May after taking nearly a years worth of Statistics. Unfortunately this book proved to be more of a hindrance than a help. It threw various different concepts into piebald mixtures that didn't make much sense. In particular, the section on probability was not only confusing, but in several cases the formulas and examples were incorrect.After disposing of this book, I turned around and bought the Barron's AP Statistics Prep Book, which I found to be infinitely more helpful. If you want decent test preparation, buy the Barron's book; if you want confusing nonsense, buy the Princeton Review's book."
3,needs more revision,"As it is now, the book is very confusing. The author, however, has very good grip on statistics, and could make a treasure out of it with more efford. The author posesses a lot of desire to help students and gives some very helpful tips in the beginning of the book."
1,Dented cans,"About half the cans in my case were dented, and it certainly looks to me that they must have been dented before being packaged together into my case (cans in the middle of the pack have side dents, for example). I had intended to include a can or two into care packages destined for American soldiers (a little taste of Thanksgiving, and the cans are pretty enough to be decorative). But, I can't be sending dented cans to our troops -- and I don't want to eat from dented cans myself, so I'm vexed. For purposes of this review, I opened a good can to taste the product, and the product tastes good. It certainly costs enough. I would have been quite happy with this if I didn't find half the goods were damaged (I consider them unusable), and I didn't think that I was intentionally bamboozled by someone trying to dump dented cans."
2,9 of 12 cans badly DENTED!,"I read the previous reviews about dented cans and crossed my fingers. Well, lucky me - 9 of 12 cans were badly dented. The cans are obviously packed and sealed by the manufacturer. Amazon did a fantastic job by wrapping that box in two layers of bubble wrap. The manufacturer box was pristine, which means the cans were put in the box already dented. This is such bad quality control in this day and age. The manufacturer should be ashamed!"
3,death fantasy,"It makes sense to me as death fantasy music because I had a boyfriend who always played it alot and committed suicide by deliberate negligance. I suppose it does deserve 4 stars for being powerful but dangerous though.There is a histrionic feel to it; emotional and fantastic ; as though a self-induced my-life flashing- before my-eyes in a stream of consciouness. A ""My re-cap "" death fantasy deal. Death as the ultimate trip than its sadder oblivion ( or was it playing devil's advocate to avoid dealing wth life having a tiny devil tattoo on having ankle?)Maybe I'm too biased from a boyfriend too dissapointed mean-streaked and idealistic to be long for this world. Doctor said don't smoke to avoid thrombosis after a car accicent but he was on 3 packs a day. Worse-lying about in our tent he looked like the cover painting on the Cd cover."
4,Marillion - Fugazi (Bonus CD),"Um bom disco que mereceu a remasterizao de qualidade. Vale à pena também o CD bnus que traz coisas diferentes. Esta edio é especial e para quem gosta da banda, no pode faltar. No é o melhor disco da banda, mas no deixa de ser bom."
5,Where are the Prophets?,"The mid '80s were an interesting time for pop music. Some bands let keyboards drive them (Eurythmics) and some bands let their guitars do the talking (Big Country). During this same period, prog rock experienced something of a revival. And Gabriel era Genesis inspired Marillion led the way. With musicians par excellence (Steve Rothery - guitar, Pete Treavus - bass, Ian Mosely - drums, and Fish - vocals) they really took off, at least in England. In america, the best they could muster was an opening slot for Rush on the Power windows tour.Fugazi is the middle album of a trilogy and represents the first record by the classic lineup with Mosely having replaced Mick Pointer on drums. An album of politics, blaring guitars, and heavy keyboard interludes, this album grabs you by the shirt. Where Script was uneven and Childhood bombastic, this album was much more succinct. That said, Script and Childhood are also musts, but this one is my favorite....The song Incubus is CLASSIC"
4,One album that really grows on you.,"Fugazi was one of my least favorite Marillion albums - that was until I really began to listen to it. Less immediately catchy than Misplaced Childhood or even Clutching at Straws, Fugazi holds some of Fish's most poignant lyrics and the music is often subtle - exactly what the songs call for. I would never have thought that a lyric including the words ""cold linolium"" could be touching. Fish and Marillion make it so."
4,I'll be honest,"I'm a big fan of the Fish years, I have every album. If i want to tell the truth this is the one i like least,that's not to say I don't like it, I do. its hard to put in words what i don't like but I'll try. First i don't need or want to hear every song twice (demos) it just seems like filler to me. second, to my ear it just doesn't have the kick that Clutching at straws (my favorite) or script for a jesters tear does. If your a fan as i am you must have this one ,"
5,Where Has This Girl Been? What A Voice!,"Before anybody had heard of Jessica King her husband (and producer) released a single from this CD (Keep Me In Your Will) and for a minute I thought Lorrie Morgan had recorded a gospel release. This girl could sing with any of Nashville's finest female country singers, yet the message here is absolutely gospel. If you or someone else has never heard ""gospel"" music because they were afraid it didn't meet the ""quality"" they expected, get them this CD. I can't wait for Jessica to record again!"
1,Something Wrong Here,I love her music but when I came here to buy a couple of her CD's I changed my opinion. Nearly $70.00 for a CD. Is she a Crook or just greedy. Something is not right about this and it just kind of turned me off.
5,Chanticleer eloquently presents Palestrina's work.,"Chanticleer has a wonderful talent for performing works of the Rennaissance period gracefully and accurately. The melodic lines are masterfully brought to the ear's attention while the thick harmonic layerings are felt below, in a somewhat ominous fashion. This music is beyond beautiful and is performed without flaw. One can sit back and drift away to the mysterious and beautiful sounds of Palestrina."
4,Many different takes,"A nice assortment of stories based on Holmes' ""missing years"". I prefer this anothology to Michael Kurland's Moriarty novels since Holmes takes center stage in all but Richard Lupoff's story, which is from a previous anthology. Kurland's take on what really happened at Reichenbach is interesting, and explains several vague references in his novels. The first nine stories are quite good, taking Holmes all over the world. The only thing that keeps me from giving this a five stars is Michael Collins' tale - Doyle's Holmes never made political statements and authors shouldn't use him to promote their beliefs."
4,Great re-issue from Esoteric,There is no bonus material but this remaster is an improvement over the German issue. This is a very unique album. It has an almost minimalist feel. My only complaint is that that actual album was mixed weird. Arthur Brown's amazing performance was mixed too low on the original recording (Nothing to do w remaster) Other wise a worthy up grade! A little more volume and mid-rnage than the rare german edition.
2,Okay. Needs a New Working.,"This would be a very good book if it were not written in boring, stuffy and stilted British English. Then again it was written in 1915, and by a Brit. This book first introduced English readers to the legends of the Lorelei, the Mouse Tower, the Wild Hunt. If only someone can come along and retell these stories as if a real Rhinelander was speaking and not some tedious British aristocrat this would be a marvelous book!!"
5,Information Galore!,"I find this guide to be dynamic, an exciting read, and filled with loads of information. It's like no other. I've mentored students, and now I don't have to 'try' to explain about aid and scholarships and 'doing the right thing.' I have had round-table discussions with students who gave positive feedback about the college guide. They were intrigued by many of the topics listed and the different scenarios presented in the guide. I have told many students and their parents about it. I would give the guide 10 stars!"
4,Good choice for dual language learning,"This is a very good book for learning English and Spanish. The book is very well made and a great size for little hands. The pictures are large, bright and colorful. However, the Spanish does not include the article. This is very helpful in learning the gender of the word and should be taught with the vocabulary. There is also a couple of strange choices. For example, Q stands for ""quetzal"" rather than something more familiar like ""queso""."
5,Great books,"I really like theses books. I purchased them as a gift for my nephew who has billingual parents. They were much smaller than I expected, but the description does indicate that the books are 5.9 x 4.7 x 0.8 inches. Still love them and the thick pages are perfect for toddlers who are not gentle enough yet to have paper pages."
4,The Alphabet (English-Spanish Foundations),"The quality of the books is superior! the images are so well done it is a pleasure just to look at them!! The content is relevant and adequate for todlers. The only thing I didn't like is that the books are too hard to handle for my 18 month old granddaughter! However, the hard bound books will take any abuse! Great books!!!!!!"
3,Practical Instruction Yet Outdated,"Chess Strategies covers principles of all aspects of the game, detailing many elements of the opening, middle and end games, as well as providing analysis of illustrative games. The book uses descriptive notation which takes some minor getting used to for new players. A potential glaring issue is that it is unclear who the author is, as no one by the name of Frank Eagan has ever competed in major chess tournaments, leaving one to question his authority on the subject.There is some good content in this book that proves useful. It includes many ideas and principles that anyone expecting to succeed in club play should master. However, there is nothing in the book any more revealing than many current top chess books have to offer. Considering the book was written with old notation, by an unknown author, and is old enough to exclude the last thirty years of play, one is clearly far better served reading some of the new books put our by current GMs."
4,Dispelling Mafia myths and unveiling WitSec,"If you loved the movie ""Goodfellas,"" you may well hate ""On the Run"" for its' honest portrayal of hood Henry Hill. His children, Gregg and Gina, lay bare the ugly truth of life in the shadow of a criminal daddy. Their riveting stories strip away the movie-Mafia's romance and glitz with childhood visits to Lewisburg federal prison and family life revolving around professional criminals who were just as likely to scam, rob, assault or murder each other as they were any other member of the public. And that's just the beginning... The Hill's depiction of the Witness Security Program (WitSec) is just as eye-opening. A fascinating, raw chronicle, from the heart, that will make readers squirm uncomfortably as they watch Henry Hill drag his family through Hell. ...With several pages of family photos including the Hill kids' murderous ""uncles,"" Jimmy Burke and Tommy Disimone."
5,The Dysfunctional of all dysfunctional Families.,"A gripping, terrific read. The Wiseguy/Goodfella is portrayed as a narcisstic, hedonistic rat. Karen comes across as completely different than portrayed by Lorraine Bracco. Karen is close to a Saint. And Henry is close to the Devil. The children produce a sensitive, thoughtful account of ""Life on the Run"". They both displayed maturity FAR beyond their years."
4,A Childhood From Hell,"Gregg and Gina Hill sure have some stories to tell. Their memoirs portray an extremely disfunctional family loaded with numerous criminal activity, physical abuse, drug addicition, sexual escapades, and much more. The world of Henry Hill is exposed to the world as a self-serving mobster. Its amazing how both Gina and Henry's wife are enamored by the gangster life. Gregg merely tolerates it during his. early years but then becomes the first to rebel against it.Its very interesting to watch as how each of the family members turn out. Sadly they seem to each go in a different direction. At least Greg and Gina each find lives that are reasonably rewarding and satisfying as compared to the constant violence they were subjected to as children.Overall an intriguing account of life inside a mobster family."
1,KINDLE PRICES NUTS!,"Amazon, you need to do something about these Kindle book prices! And don't tell us that ""the publisher set the price!"" That's a LAME excuse.Why would I want to spend $11 for a Kindle edition when I can buy the paperback for $1.95?!If you set SANE prices for your Kindle books, your sales will go through the roof. Stay greedy and your sales will sooner, rather than later, tank."
4,Michael Biehn makes for a good psychotic villian,"Michael Biehn upstages the good guys as a psychotic killer who befriends two rich boys for reasons other then friendship. Eventually, he is rooted out for who he is, but not before he piles on a body count at the boys' expense.MB plays a wonderfully psychotic villian in this film, second only (and, at that, debatably) to Travolta's character in ""Broken Arrow."" He steals the show in an otherwise by-the-numbers movie."
5,Great guide to help you chose what you may like,"This is not a ""tell all"" or an ""include all"" guide to adult movies. Instead this guide does two things. First it lets us know what types of movies you can get through Good Vibrations and why they are so selective. That probably isn't so interesting to most readers of this review. The second thing this guide does is give a good background on what adults movies should do, advice on finding what you like, and a historical lesson on the industry. If you are looking for hundreds of pages of reviews, that isn't this book, nor will this book give you a blow by blow description of the movies it does review. Instead it helps you figure out what you are looking for and how to find it before you waste another chunk of money on porn you can't stand to watch."
4,Good for beginners,"This is a good video for beginners. The author immediately gets into playing and shows the viewer how to play the left hand and right hand together. After watching the video the viewer should be able to incorporate more ""licks"" and left hand baseline patterns into their playing using other material from books and videos etc."
1,Not favorable,"Tho price is nice, this item does not compare favorably with instructional piano piece by Dr. John."
5,Great recording; noble interpretation,"Given that Rostropovich is rightly accounted among the leading interpreters of Shostakovich's symphonies, this June 1994 recording is easily recommended alongside other great digital recordings, such as Neeme Jarvi with the Scottish National Orchestra on Chandos records. Penguin Guide gave their Rosette (highest rating) to Alexander Rahbari on Naxos records, but I prefer the intensity of sound the National Symphony delivers on this recording, (although the Rahbari is worth getting for the marvelous rendition of the Symphony no. 9.) The time of this CD is nearly 46 minutes, which would allow space for another work (which both the two other recordings mentioned take advantage of,) but as it really suits this symphony to be heard alone anyway, it is convenient as a lone work on CD."
2,weak and disjointed,"I've heard several of the zillions of recordings of Shostakovich's 5th so far. Of them, both the best and the worst are by Rostropovich and his National Symphony Orchestra. Unfortunately this one from 1991 is the worst, and the best is currently out of print (DG #410 509-2, from 1983).Rostropovich (in the DG recording) conveys stark terror in a way no other composer even approaches. He does this by, among other things, slowing down the 4th movement. Mravinsky, the original interpreter, takes the 4th at a fast clip, but slows down the finale. Bernstein rushes through it and totally misses the emotional impact. Haitink's on Decca is quite good, and superbly recorded, but also fails to capture the finale.I hope DG reissues the superior Rostropovich soon. For now we have the next-best thing, a gorgeous new live recording of the 5th by Rostropovich and the London Symphony Orchestra in the LSO Live series (the recording is from July 2004), so do not settle for this tepid substitute."
2,not Ms. Jarrett's best....,"This is the second Harlequin Historical I've tried by Miranda Jarrett. Sadly-these series Historicals fall short of her usual great writing.The main problem with this book is that the storyline and the behavior of every character is totally implausible for the time period. The characters behave more like people in the modern age and that's not I want in a Historical romance.I do not recommend this book and would instead recommend some of Ms. Jarrett's other, non Harlequin books.1.5 stars."
3,Too esoteric,"Some good ideas, but lots of stuff needed to make this items. Very few of us have the kind of buttons the book works with."
2,Doodle monster,The kids asked for this incessantly before Christmas. They opened it immediately when they got it but only played with it twice. I thought theyd be more interetsted since they both love to draw. It does wash exactly as its supposed to however there should be a pocket on the bears and monsters to store the markers so they dont get separated and lost.
1,its a very boring toy,Okay I gave this to my brother for his 7th birthday after he wanting it so bad.After 2 days of playing with it after washing it 2 times he got boerd with it and starting using the markers to draw on other things eventualy breaking the markers.I would think again twice before you buy this because it made me do alot of loads of laundry for that only thing in it a doodle monster and it cost alot of money now and days to run the washing machine and dryer constantly
3,"Nice tools, but compass doesn't work","I purchased 2 of these to keep in my vehicles for a ""just in case"" tool. Item arrived just as described. Quality seems OK so far, however one big fault. The compasses do not work and both are pointing in different directions. They do not appear to be stuck, just not working.I hadn't planned on using the compass, but still. The quality control is lacking and I am wondering just how well these will perform for other uses."
3,Nice,"This card has two main tools, the knife and the can opener. The other stuff may or may not be functional, but all in all, I like it. For me, it's better than carrying around a pocket knife. Nice...not thrilling, but nice."
3,"nice product , compass does not work","The product concept is great.however the compass does not work, and its my replacement was no better.so if you need it for the compass don't bother."
2,pretty cool,"this is a pretty cool tool. its neat but if you go on BUDK.com you can buy an all metal multi tool that has over ten uses on it and is only .99 cents good price and works really good same size maybe smaller and has a saw, knife, ruler, and a lot more it also comes in a little case and has a water proof peice of plastic/paper saying all the uses for it i suggest looking it up you will not be dissapionted!"
3,Just OK! Will do the trick...,"I guess it's OK for an emergency, or to save a sudden situation. The best thing is the blade and the magnifying glass. I have not tried the can opener, but does appear to have no leverage at all. We'll see...As many have noted, the compass appeared to be broken or crazy. However, I found that it is because of the metal blade and can opener interference. If you remove them from the set, the compass appears to work okl. Don't get me wrong, it's not a wonderful precise compass to get lost in the woods with and find your way back, but it does the trick. I just got it, so I cannot comment much on durability; however, I'm not expecting much."
2,Compass Not working,"Received today, opened shipping box, looked at Compass and it does not work - didn't even open packaging - simply Returned today and not ordering another. The Tool Logic item is packaged in clear plastic, why not look and see if the compass works before sending it out??"
3,Its Alright,"I wish I would of red the reviews before hand, Everyone is pretty accurate, the compass does not work upon arrival, and the only thing that is great quality is the knife. Its a great way to have a knife handy on you, but other than that, should not be 15 dollars."
3,Compass Came Broken,"Everything in the tool is in order, but I bought it brand new (still in the packaging) for my boyfriend's birthday and the compass will not spin because it looks like it is crooked and wedged into a side. Pretty disappointed."
3,Meh,"Not to bad for the price, but the compass is a joke along with the magnifying lens. Other then that everything is fine with it."
4,Knife really is nice,The unit is not for a wallet due to the thickness. The knife is awesome though (as others have stated). I ordered multiple items including this knife and used the knife to open other packages. It cut though the other packaging better than any other blade I've used.
2,cheap,"Compass is useless bottle opener is hard to hold, knife feels like it would inflict more damage on yourself than a zombie. magnifying glass in tiny tweezers are fat and only good thing is the toothpick if you have teeth like Madonna. Swiss card is much much better."
1,dont do it,"its a neat novelty, but as far as any kind of application, its crap. should have left this one alone"
2,Let a person can't survive survival gear!,This item beside the steering wheel with a screw influence its operation: and if the item with the can opener open I canned: maybe I would rather choose starve to death!
3,my little bro carrys everyday,i got this for my little bro and he really likes it and carrys it everyday in his wallet i like money clips better than wallets so this wouldnt work for me plus i like multi tools better than these cards or swiss army knives and i dont carry serrated blades but it seems to be built well so if you like the design and use wallets give it a try.
2,Mostly decent...,"The magnifying lens is too small for most practical purposes, and the compass doesn't work. The rest of it is OK.Tool Logic CC1SB Credit Card Companion With 1/2 Serrated Knife, Compass, Magnification Lens, Tweezers and Toothpick, Translucent Black"
1,please inspect the product before sending,"came with a broken compass. haven't tried the knife yet, but it wouldn't be very helpful to bring along if compass isn't working."
1,Don't bother,"Compass doesn't work, Magnifying lens not able to start a fire, Knife is awkward to hold, try to use the screwdrivers and the point from the can opener stabs your hand.....you get the idea. There are much better options from Tool Logic. Don't bother with this."
3,Cool little backup,I would compare this favorably with a Victorinox sd classic. Though different configuration and shape they share similar functions. Feels sturdy enough for occasional to daily use. The blade is a single sided bevel which is common in the smaller sizes. All items feel like they have a good positive lock in the case. I wish it could be a touch thinner as it takes up one side of my money clip but as I usually don't carry much cash and all my cards fit on the other side it is not a problem. I actually use the lens instead of a loop quite often (for diamonds).
2,"this version/model, i don't laugh at bad jokes","the blade is fine, the tweezers and tooth-pick rival swiss army, the magnifying glass ok, the can opener is too small to grip, the compass GET LOST.for the money, i got mine back ""returns are easy at amazon.com""."
3,"Okay, but .....","It has a lot of things stuffed into a relatively small space, but don't expect it to fit in your wallet. It sure didn't fit in mine. Maybe my eyeballs need calibrating but the magnification lens is virtually worthless, as is the compass. It doesn't point anywhere near to north and you're better off checking for the mossy side of a tree if you need to check a direction."
3,Good credit card knife.... for awhile.,i got this for chirstmas and used it quiet abit.Pros:good little knife with attachmentsand thats it compass crapy and magnifying glass doesnt work and starting to fall apart.the only reason it got 3 stars is because of the knife and attachments.
3,good,"the knife it ok, can opener its kind of small I did not try it on a can , compass it isnt working,the other tools are ok!"
4,Useful,"This little card is very useful. I bought it as a little Christmas gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. The only thing is, with the metal things in, the compass doesn't work. They seem to interfere with it. I thought the compass was completely broken, but he noticed it's not that the compass is broken, as once all the metal is out of the card, the compass is back to normal and pointing north.Kind of a let down that you have to empty the card out before you use the compass, but I'm still giving 4 stars as we're not often in need of finding north. The knife is sharp and everything else works wonderfully. If you're looking for something like this, I say buy!"
4,Not Bad at All,"This lil tool has what you need in such a great lil package. The only problem with the ""credit card companion"" is the compass. The compass is a little floater that doesnt work...other than that its pretty awesome."
3,Cheaper than it appears,"I purchased this in the hopes that I could buy each one of my sons this item for Christmas. Upon looking at this product I now know that I will NOT be buying more. The items do not fit well back in place once you pull them out of the card for the first time. Also, the compass is worthless. The dial does not spin freely. I made sure that I was out in the middle of a field, to make sure there was nothing else interfering with the magnetic field. The knife is sharp, that is the one good thing. All in all, I would say this is a good idea that has been executed poorly."
2,Compass broken,"Compass is cheap and was broke upon arrival. And good luck getting the can opener to work. Cheap also. For the price I would say, no way is it worth the purchase. Most of the items are way too small to use productively."
1,Garbage...,"A complete waste of money, definitely returning it. Its made of cheap plastic and just overall garbage. The knife is kind of cool but that is about it. Not paying $15 for a tiny knife. Cant believe so many peopled gave it a high rating..."
2,"Par quality, low utility","The good: toothpick and tweezers are good quality. Knife is a good size ( and the only useful tool.)The bad: compass does not function, can-opnener impossble to use and not useful. The blade is cheap 440 stainless, serrations are useless on a compact knife, poor edge out of the box.The ugly: a very heavy thing for its size -- not a great quality. Also it is opaque, not translucent, black."
2,Compass doesn't work,It is all around a good tool except that the compass doesn't work. It has to be tapped a couple of time before it will point North.
2,Meh,"The Knife is the best part, however for the size and weight, you would be better served by a neck knife, e.g. Ka-Bar.I also haven't been able to get the compass to work yet. My young eyes have no issue with the glass, but I haven't done anything but look at my skin. I will be replacing this with something that all the features work.I will update after I have used this for a bit."
2,i wasn't impressed,"i wasn't impressed by the build quality.the knife is okay, other than that nothing much to write."
2,Not what I expected!,"I thought this would be great tool in pocket, but only knife is useful, compass doesn't work, it always point in one direction no matter where you are pointing, as if it is stuck on dial."
5,wonderful secret,"years ago i had one of these in my wallet. Some friends and i went on the Craig Kilborn show (when he was doing late night) he was doing some sketch and asked people in the audience with weapons to place them on his desk. I had no idea they had planted fake weapons in the audience as a gag. So I walked up and placed my knife on the desk. I got interviewed by security on how i snuck a knife into the show, i told them their security wasnt that great."
3,Compass Defect,"As I inspected the compass feature on the companion, I noticed that the compass didn't point north. Upon closer examination, I realized that the MAGNETIC needle was pointing to the METAL screws holding it in place. Tisk tisk. Only other real complaint is that the magnifying glass is so small, it makes it very difficult to ignite tender. Other than these two things, this item was everything I expected."
3,Good blade usless others,This was a great buy. For the knife that is. The blade is great and very durable but the rest of the accessories are absolutely useless. The bottle opener can not open a bottle due to its design (too small of a mouth and the tip slides around as you try to get leverage). And the other things I never would use (a plastic toothpick?). I probably wouldn't buy again and would just get a pocketknife because this is really all it is good for.
2,"Good idea, handy, but flawed","This multi-tool is actually really handy at times. I always find uses for it because it's in my wallet all the time, so if I need a knife or tweezers I'm set.The main turn off for me is the compass. The first time I tried using it, it said that south was north, so I thought that the magnetism was backwards. What it actually happened is the compass aims towards the metal pieces in the tool. If the knife, bottle opener, or even the tweezers are in place in the card, the compass aims towards them, messing up your bearing. It even points towards the little metal screws used to hold the compass in place on the card. Really bad compass design. Doesn't even have a screw driver to remove the screws to let it read accurately."
4,Not bad for tools that fit inside a credit card.,I like this tool. I do not use this every day but rather as an emergency tool. It would fit a wallet but is thicker than a credit card. More like 3 cards together.
3,It's okay,"I haven't had a practical use for it yet, but its not made of cheap material. The only problem i have with mine is the compass doesn't work at all, and it doesn't fit in my credit card slot in my wallet. But its worth the money I paid for it."
2,Disappointing.,"I was expecting this little credit card tool to come in handy often, and to be a life savior. In short, everything on here is inferior to a simple folding knife. The can opener barely does its job after an hour of working at a small can, the knife is pathetic, and the serrations are weak. This does not open bottles, the compass doesn't point north, the screwdriver doesn't fit anything I have tried it on yet, and the magnifying glass barely magnifies. In all honesty, I use the toothpick the most, and am most pleased by the toothpick out of everything on this little tool. I would not reccomend buying this, unless you absolutely cannot have a simple folding knife."
4,different,bought as a gift for my son... he collects knives and likes the ones that are different. He likes it.
3,"Nifty, but not Credit Card thickness","This isn't going to fit in most Credit Card slots of a leather wallet without stretching them out.It will fit in the internal ""pocket"" type spot that a lot of wallets have.I think the knife is the best part of this card, not recommending it, but in a bad situation this fits snuggly between the knuckles.I'm going to travel with it in a few weeks (international flight) and see if the confiscate it at security. or if it can make it through just sitting inside my wallet in the tiny basket going through the scanner. If they take it oh well."
5,Tool Logic,I bought two of these. Two of my four boys are always out hiking and camping. This tool will definitely come in handy.
4,objet intéressant - frais trop eleves.,"l'objet est bien pratiquelesdelais d'envoi sont brefsagreable a manipuler, de bonne qualitémais, avec les frais a revient a plus de 50$ dommage, plus de 3 fois le prix annoncé."
3,"It's alright,but.....","I got sucked into buying this thing cause I was bored, I wanted a little tool to fit in wallet in case of emergencies or whatever. The tool itself turn out pretty good, worth buying because its cheap.The knife is really good, super sharp, and clean. Compass sucks but I usually rely on the sun to give my position.Magnifying glass sucked too can't see anything in it but turns out it can burn stuff under the sun so that's cool. Tweezers and toothpick came in handy for some uses.I didn't notice till I bought it but it has cm/inch ruler on the back, I liked it. screwdriver and can opener was okay, I only use the can opener for beers though.Overall, I liked it, it doesn't have all the other neat tools like Victorionix or other brands but it's still good plus it fits in my wallet pretty good.If you want something small yet capable of performing little task, I'd recommend it."
3,"ehh, comes in handy","You get what you pay for i guess. It's thicker than I anticipated. So if you keep a pretty packed wallet, it could be difficult to squeeze it in. The top piece/can opener is like most others mention, small but does work. The blade is sharp but small as expected, I do have large hands so if your hands are medium to small I'm sure its more comfortable.The toothpick is a toothpick, not other way to describe it. The tweezers unlike the depicted image are metal. The magnifying glass works but unless you have poor eye site I don't see the need. The compass all all others have complained about is garbage, like many others it arrived not necessarily broken but extremely inaccurate. They offer another model with an led light in place of the compass, however the blade in that model to me wasn't as appealing."
2,Compass doesn't work,"The compass doesn't work, and the bottle opener is really two small to get any leverage. The knife is nice but there are cheaper, more convenient knives on Amazon."
4,About What I Expected,"My CC1SB arrived today. It is about what I expected in terms of quality -- it seems well-made, although the included compass doesn't appear to work. (I have already e-mailed Tool Logic's customer service, so we'll see what happens there). Otherwise it's about what everyone has been saying, with a sharp little knife and a smallish magnifying glass. The biggest selling point for me personally was the bottle/can opener.I hope to stick this in my wallet and never need it, but it's better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it."
2,"Cool concept, not well executed","I love the idea behind this tool. Unfortunately there are some big things wrong with it. First the compass doesn't work. Second, the tools are really hard to pull out, almost to the point where it's dangerous. I don't recommend this, but could eventually if it were made better."
4,Buy this for the knife,"LIke most of the other reviews have stated this is a convienent way to carry a knife with you at all times in your wallet, but the other tools are basically useless. I am not sure the compas ever worked and the magnifying glass is not strong enough to really be considered a firestarter, but i will say there have been many times when I needed a knife and would not have had one if this card wasnt in my wallet."
4,pratique !,"un vrai couteau suisse sans l'encombrement, rentre dans un emplacement pour CB dans un porte feuille, la lame coupe très bien"
3,"Good to keep in the wallet, useless for heavy duty work","Product is decent if it doesn't see too much wear and tear. The compass doesn't work on any of these apparently, and there's certain tricks to make the bottle opener work effectively. But I use the knife several times per week and it hasn't failed me yet. If you need something heavyduty, this isn't it. Buy anything Leatherman if that's the case."
4,almost 5 stars,"the compass did not work when it came in, but i never pursued it due to the fact that i don't need a compass. the rest of the tool works very well, i am thinking about getting a few more of the other models of this tool as backups and gifts."
2,Compass please?,The tool itself was relatively good but the compass did not work at all. How am I supposed to find my way when I get lost? Fix that and I may consider recommending this product.
1,Worthless,"Completely worthless! Bottle and can opener function does not work at all. the tooth pick which broke the first time I took it out, Really? It would have been better if they just put a straight pin there instead. The compass is completely off and hard changes at all. The blade, it would better without the serrations. Nearly impossible to hold properly. the Fresnel lenses does work for fire starting and reading topographical maps. The only reasons I rate this a One star. is because that's the default setting for ""hate it"". Definitively returning this product."
1,Almost useless,"The knife is marginally useful but the rest isn't. The worst feature is the can/bottle opener. It's so small it's almost impossible to get a grip on it. I tried to use it to pop off a bottle cap, but it just punched through the top of the cap and there was no leverage after that.Get a Swiss army knife!"
3,Really Not As Useful As You Think,"I purchased this item as a gift for my father, and I have to say, I was very, very disappointed with a few things:1.) The online description for this item was inaccurate, listing more tools that the actual product has, and2.) The quality of most of the tools that ARE included are well below average. I.e.- the tweezers, which are plastic and don't work at all, and the compass, which doesn't point anywhere consistently.I wanted my Dad to have a small tool that gave him a few gadgets that would be useful which wasn't a pocket knife. Needless to say, I feel I've wasted money on this, and I'm still continuing my search for a better suited product that is actually as advertised.The only reason I am giving this three stars instead of two or even one is the blade, which is the ONLY quality thing on this. It's sharp, durable, and easy to hold unless you have big hands. Maybe Tool Logic should stick to knifes- they seem to know what they're doing, there."
4,Flying to the real limit,"This is a great book. Roland Beamont tells us the story of his life, signed by the war years (i.e. as fighter pilot, and later chasing V-1 flying bombs) and the dangerous test of the 1940's unexplored aircrafts (Typhoon and Tempest). In the post-war era, he tells us about the development of the new jets, and the solutions to the ""compressibility"" problem, and the ""sound barrier"" dilemma. Vampire, Canberra, P.1, Lightning, and the BAC TSR.2 were flown by the author, many of them as program chief test pilot. Later, he also flies the Jaguar and the Tornado. Test were joined with (recently) desclassified documents refering to the handling, maneouvrability or development problems found by the author after each flight. This book isn't a typical ""war hero"" tale. It has a different point of view: The test pilot's, who flies a ""first time flight"" in any new test, in any new flight, looking for a new and unknown limit.-"
3,Review for the generalist reader,"As mentioned in another review, this book has been set as a college textbook. I am sure it fulfils that roile admirably. However, from the point of view of the generalist reader looking for something `meaty' on the subject of American cities, I can't really recommend it.It is full of rather dry statistics and facts. I was particularly interested in Los Angeles, and the book did provide some very useful background information, but it left me unsatisfied - I didn't come away with a `feel' for the city in any human sense.For a more passionate account of Los Angeles, still in a scholarly work, I can recommend `The History of Forgetting' by Norman Klein.Please don't feel I don't think this book isn't useful within its context, but if you are looking for something scholarly yet with some passion, you may well be disappointed in this book."
1,Annoying,I find it annoying that the author includes Chicago in the same tier as NY and LA. How can the buckle of the midwest rustbelt be in the same league as the premier coastal cities? It's absurd I tell you.
1,connector did not fit my Jeep,"I made sure that I checked the ""Make sure it fits"" option before I bought these. well, It said it would fit but it didn't. I ended up having to cut the connectors off and my jeeps wire harness, spliced the wires and connected them w/ electrical tape. This worked but its not a connect and go like it says. I would not recommend these to any jeep owner."
1,Does not fit my 2003 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon,Although it says it fits. It does not fit my application. I had to Cut the end off and spice it in UNFORTUNATELY!
3,Does not fit 2003 Jeep Wrangler,This does not fit 2003 Wrangler even though it will say it does. You need to get the 'Metra 72-6514 Speaker Harness for Select Chrysler/Dodge Vehicles'
5,Doesn't fit dash speakers Ram 1500,"Rated a 5 because I used the other sizes for all the other speakers and they worked like a champ. Ended up having to cut and splice, which I didn't want to do under the dash in my 2012 Ram 1500. Had I ordered the right size it would have been perfect. Oops.DOES NOT FIT DASH SPEAKERS RAM 1500"
3,CD Audio version - abridged heavily.,"This was my first exposure to Elmer Kelton. The story was very good and easy to follow. The CD audio is only 4 hours long and starts out after the first trip to Texas, with Mordecai already gone. The fate of the brother who's shot at his ranch was unknown to me, since the abridgment didn't disclose his fate. There are a number of times when the narrative jumps and it's obvious the listener has missed a good bit."
2,"Elmer Keltons ""Sons Of Texas""",This is the fifth book I've read by Elmer Kelton.I really enjoyed the historical perspective of how it must have been to journey west through the recently acquired Louisiana Territory and probe into the Spanish owned territory of Texas.I'm just about to begin the second in the Trilogy.
3,Privacy Fence,"Great Fence -- love the privacy it gives -- my dogs don't bark 1/2 as much at people who are just walking their dogs or walking themselves up and down the street -- they can still see when someone comes into our yard, but don't care as much about them walking by our house. It's really nice."
4,Cool,"Very informative and interesting. This would be five stars if not for all the spelling and grammar errors! For example, in the bio of George Wythe, the first letters of the second sentence read, ""Ho was ham n 1726."" The title of the book on the SPINE is even misspelled! But it is still interesting to read. I recommend it, just ignore the errors."
3,Where is Thomas Jefferson?,"I realize that this is a reprint of a book written in 1860, but does any one know why Thomas Jefferson was not included?"
3,The piano music is great BUT,I love the piano. BUT I could do without the flutey sax thing. If I want Kenny G. I would listen to Kenny G. I wanted to listen to the O'Neill Brothers and the pianos they play on. The violin accompaniment is fine. But that wannabe sax thing ruins it every time. I have deleted all of the tracks that use it. So I have lost more than half of the albums. Darn. Why did they do that? Their forte is piano.
2,Not Impressed,"You get what you pay for...Our Pyramid MDC6's are mounted on the outside of a toy hauler camper. The audio sound has never been that good, but now it is not even tolerable; in fact during our last outing, I was told by others to lower the volume because the sound was so distorted. Additionally, I noticed that the plastic bezel/screen is cracking exactly where the screws secure the speaker to the outside wall. Fortunately, the bezel is 'glued' to the outer camper shell for added waterproofness. I suspect that the speakers may have succumbed to the sun's UV and the heat-cold cycling in our region. I will be searching for something else very soon."
2,Not very good,"Came as exterior speakers on our travel trailer. Sound quality was not very good, might have been due to the quality of the radio/CD combo in the trailer as well, as that's low-end too. But since we hardly don't use the audio system at all and especially not the exterior speakers, we didn't care too much.After the first year, the outside went from white to yellow due to exposure to sun light. Also, one of the covers came loose and I had to glue it back in. Not sure which one of the two that was, as now, four years after purchase of the trailer, we arrived at the campground with one of the covers missing (guess it was same one). Was not planning on buying same speaker again, but there's not much choice when limited to a depth of 1 1/2""..."
3,Rusty Screws,All is well except for the screws; rusty. I think the speakers have good sound quality and they fit (even though I popped the plastic on each casing with one of four screws). I will eventually have to purchase some water proof screws. Installation was simple. Speakers were soaked once and went out for the day; came back after they had dried. Speakers are otherwise a 4* out of 5*. Thank you!
2,Distortion,"Attractive speakers installed on exterior wall of camper. Using with a Jenson Stereo will not handle base. Much distortion, ordered a replacement speaker and had same problem."
5,Pyramid Speakers,"The speakers I received met my expectations, I installed them in my 5th wheel trailer on the out side for better sound."
5,Surprised,"perfect, only it didnt say if there were 2 or 1 in the box(or i didnt see anyways). there were 2, even better!!!"
2,Low quality speakers....you get what you pay for..fine for cheapo ones,Speakers look nice but if you push any bass they distort. I installed them in my project boat up front in the factory speaker location. Worked ok....fast forward a year and a new headunit and you can barely hear the speakers...not sure if it's a connection issue but i doubt it. Boat was in storage for a year so wasn't in the water yet....i'm going to get a better pair next year.
4,Great value.,"I'm not a serious studiophile so my requirements were light: A set of monitors close to my old M-Audio Studiophile SP-5B in audio quality; High wattage was not required; A volume knob on the front. These satisfied all those requirements great!I also appreciate the protection over the speaker cones. The M-Audio's did not have anything over the speaker cones. With no good evidence, I suspect they damage audio quality. Even so, for me this is an improvement.That said, the audio quality is slightly less than the M-Audio Studiophile SP-5Bs. Not enough that I feel like I'm loosing out, but noticeable."
4,Edirol reference speakers,"pleasant surprise, great sounding reference monitors for small home studio, esp. for price. hooked up with optical to Korg 32XD- everything digital.small desktop but plenty volume to mix by. handy headphone jack for sideplayers to plug in and reference, and two lines for other outputs with separate vol.control.power switch on front handy. Hell, for this review they should give me another pair! great box to pack up and carry if needed for remote work. if you can't afford $1,000 monitors start here."
4,A good light duty set,"I bought this set for one purpose threading plastic parts, and the results have been excellent so far. I expect the set will last the rest of my life.ed"
1,Bring your own tapping wrench,"It looks good, doesn't it? Even comes with a little thread gauge. Unfortunately, when I tried to tap a 4-40 thread into a 1/8"" piece of acrylic, the handle on the tapping wrench came off. It was being held in by one and a half threads on left-hand threaded end. This one's going right back to Amazon."
1,Go china:(,It works! This is was a part I wanted to use on my AR 15 tO tap and screw a spring in place.
1,"cheap junk, broken on arrival","these arrived with a broken tap wrench. the screw handle in the tap wrench would not thread into the clamp, which is ironic being that it's a tap/die set. that epitomizes the quality you should expect from this set. someone at their factory knowingly put a useless tap wrench into the set. and the dies had threads that had thin pieces of metal hanging off of them, which indicates cheap metal and poor machining. I sent the product back with no problems from amazon. It looks like I am going to have to pony up and pay for a real set."
2,Can't buy it without TOOL SIZES!,"You either need to include the sizes of the taps and dies, or remove this from Amazon. It's kind of critical information for use and PURCHASE of ANY TOOL."
1,Poor quality product,I returned this tap and die set after attempting to thread just one rod. The dies are missing a starting chamfer. They may work for cleaning off an existing thread but are lousy for starting a new thread on a rod. Overall the metal seems cheap. The handles feel like they would break under not much pressure. I should have paid more up front for something like a Craftsman set. Thought I would save money. You do get what you pay for!
1,0 Stars,"Ths is the worst kit I've ever used. I should have known not to buy one for 20 bucks. You couldn't thread hot butter with this. It didn't come with any guides or instructions, and the dies are not the size they say they are. Most of the threads were cut wrong into the tool. Even with a guide it'll start to bite then slip off and eat what ever it is your trying to thread. It would cost me more money to send the thing back than I paid for it.If you're looking for a paper weight or just want to throw 20 bucks in the trash then buy this."
2,Just another piece of cheap chineese crap,"I bought this set for theading 12/24 UNC the end of a sizing stud I turned on the lathe. Thee stud was to be used with a Lee case trimmer for 222 rem magnum cases (this is not directly available from Lee). In the picture it looked like a cheap but not bad quality set, but when I examined it, it was just crap. There were hardened steel burrs in almost all dies, they did not cut cleanly, rather teased the metal. If you want to make a quick and dirty job, and quality of threading is not an issue, you may go for it. Otherwise, better spend once your bucks and go directly for a decent quality (and higher price) one."
1,Don't waste your time & money,"I'm confused how this would get anything above one star. I attempted to thread a piece of music wire with the 4-40 die, the threads on the die were deformed almost immediately. Later, I purchased a die made by Irwin, it threaded the same piece of steel with good results.I returned the set to Amazon."
2,"The Key - William Holden, Sophia Loren, Trevor Howard (Import DVD NTSC",We were really looking forward to having a professional copy of the movie. The movie was great until the end where there were scenes missing so the movie seem really stupid and was a real disappointment. We knew the scenes were missing because it is a favorite movie of ours. We sent the DVD back and are still looking for a descent release of this terrific film.
3,The Key almost there but not quite.,Part of the story was missing which explaned why she left and left a hole in the plot. It did'n explane why she got ride of the key and seemed releaved.
3,The Track Experience,"A Review by TomGrowing up in the projects and having parents who constantly fight Kisha, and her friend Natonia are always looking for ways to keep themselves busy during the summer. That's why when the community center reopened they decided to join the track team. Even with all the problems in her life she stays determined and keeps the will to win.I think the author did a great job showing how life for Kisha and the projects was like. I found it hard to connect with Kisha because we are so different, I've never lived in the projects and I don't have the problems at home like she does. The conflicts that arose in the story were realistic for someone of that age and situation. It made the story that much more enjoyable because it was based on a true story.I recommend this book to anybody who thinks they could be able to compare their life with Kisha's. I think that if I was able to connect better with the character I would have enjoyed it much more."
1,rookidoed,This product is a poor excuse for a wash cloth;they are way too small and too expensive for what you're getting!I should have returned them; the only good thing about them is the material.
4,Good Info - Good Place to Start,"Sandra has done a very good job of presenting a complex subject in a very approachable manner. While not exhaustive, this book will give you a good basic understanding of patents and how they can help a business reach its goals."
5,I love it!!,"This book is really amazing,an exelent metod for guitar!!I'm from Brazil and it cames exactly at the time that they wrote for me.Thanks!'ll buy the volume 2 & 3 soon!"
4,"Frustrating for a new player, but worth the pain!","I disagree with the statement ""it's not for beginners"" The book takes a lot of work and a lot of practice. It gets frustrating at times too. For me the frustration came when trying to do an exercise that looked so simple... If it was tabbed out! I've only been playing for two months now and this book is my main focus. I'm only about 10 pages in, and by no means do I have those pages mastered. But there is a lot of satisfaction when you do nail and exercise. My only gripe would be that the tracks on the CD don't have a count in (I like to play along with the CD). It just starts (only reason it didn't give it the 5th star) If you are a beginner like me, I would get this book, along with a few simpler ones, there will be times when you just can't look at another note and want a book that has some tabs in it."
4,Tim touches emotions with Emotions,"Emotions is a sensitive book about love, loss, mistakes and forgiveness. It is a touching story with several interesting plot parallels. His characters are well-developed and are easy to identify with, but I would like to have seen the story go further. He ends the book where the interesting stories would just begin. Is a sequel in the works?Regardless, Tim writes a very readable, enjoyable, and entertaining story that will consume its readers over a long weekend. And while the book may be targeted to an African-American audience, its story is not at all limited to that experience. I would recommend it highly to those looking for a good read."
5,This CD is one of the best that I have heard in a long time.,"You can feel that their music is written from the heart. The songs have deep meaning in each of them. This is an excellent CD, and I recommend it to everyone."
5,Revolutionary and informative,"The Ephemeris: Including the Secrets of the Magi Society and Astrology Really Works are revolutionary. Their third book is due out March of 99 and I'm looking forward to it. The books are somewhat difficult to understand at first, however with study they are probably the best on the market. They teach that Astrology is a science (mathematical) and not an occult and these books go on to show this, using many famous charts including Bill Gates and Microsoft. You can also obtain their software and join the Society for a very resonable price. The Celestial Navigator"
2,cute but not much else,This is not that great - not real colorful and attractive to hold and chew on
2,Not very attractive or practical,"The picture on this auction looks good but when you get this item you will find that it is not very attractive in the way it looks or is packaged. I think that the colors clash and don't go together. The links come unattached and you're supposed to put them on the corners yourself which is something you can't tell from the picture. I don't like the fact that they are not attached because it makes them easy to loose if baby pulls them off and throws them. Also, the teething corners are very hard and not at all soft for baby to chew on. All around, I think that there are better teething toys out there to spend your money on."
2,Not that impressed.,"This book makes it sound like you can do everything for your wedding by shopping ebay. While its true you can purchase items and then resell after the wedding, many items on ebay were not that inexpensive to begin with. I have shopped around town and compared prices with ebay and found that some ebay things cost more in the long run when you add shipping.Stick with the biggest items like purchasing linens for your reception instead of renting them. Then, you can sell them again later. Not sure I would recommend buying a wedding gown on ebay even though you can save a lot. There are too many what ifs for your big day.I way preferred the book Bridal Bargains by Denise and Alan Fields."
1,Too many Errors,"In preparation for business school I thought I'd brush up on my stats. But this book is making things even more confusing because of all the errors. Graphs are misplaced, calculations are off, and equations are wrong in way too many places. I wonder how this was ever published with so many mistakes."
1,True Outlier,"This book was, without question, the worst math oriented book I have had the mispleasure of buying or reading. As mention in other reviews, the calculations are often off leading a reader who is reading for the purpose of developing concepts to waste substantial amounts of time. Since time is, among other things, money, this book is way to expensive, even if you were given your copy of it."
3,A fine / credible recording,"Daniel Barenboim has conducted many if not all of the Bruckner symphonies. The sixth in particular is a difficult symphony to approach because of the way Bruckner wrote the final movement. The approach used by Barenboim leaves the listener anticipating more when the symphony is actually over. Also, his tempos are a bit on the swift side which tends to rob the symphony of its meaning and makes the symphony sound more like redundant variations. However, the sound on this disc is great, and the Berlin Philharmonic continue their tradition of excellent playing. A great alternative is Otto Klemperer's recording on EMI and for a bargain CD, George Tinter's on Naxos"
5,Queen Anne Furniture,"In all my experience with fine woodworking I haven't had the pleasure to read a book that is as exquisitly written as the pieces within it. This book is a must for the serious furniture maker or collector, or anyone who wants to learn more and appreciate this magnificent craft. How did I miss this one?"
4,Inspiration from the Past,"Keb' Mo's latest set is an excellent collection of great songs from the past. Mo' does a journeyman's job of delivering these tunes, letting the lyric and melodies speak for themselves. One of my favorites is his piano-backed version of Bob Dylan's ""The Times They Are A-Changin'."" Using piano rather than guitar and Mo's world-weary wisdom result in a hopeful and unique rendition of this classic. The Youngbloods' peace anthem ""Get Together"" also works exquisitely with Paulinho Da Costa's percolating percussion. Alicia Keys recently re-did Donny Hathaway's classic ""Someday We'll All Be Free."" Keb's version again polishes this most beautiful of melodies. Other tracks like Buffalo Springfield's ""For What It's Worth"" and the Rascals' ""People Got to Be Free"" also work well. This set is upbeat and hopeful, not too distant from ""Big Wide Grin"" where Keb' did other cover tunes. This is an excellent set from one of our best. Enjoy!"
5,Different - and an impressive effort,Having been a fan for years - and seen Keb play live - this is a different bag from the blues-inspired material that put him on the map. Some have knocked this CD as it ain't blues; don't much matter to me - the guy is still a great musician. Nice arrangements of some oldies played with a lot of heart.
5,"Very good ,exellent tool!","I was not sure ,if it was gonna do a good job.But I was very suprised when the water got nice and hot,for a great hot bath>I love it.I dont know how long it will last,but for now I'am happy!"
3,"Worked great, but corroded fast","I like that this heater is actually a HEATER, and will get water warm and not just keep it from freezing. Unfortunately, it corroded so badly it would no longer work after about 3 months. I will be more careful with the next one and remove it from the water when I don't need it, so hopefully it will last longer. I JUST purchased a second one so think that in itself speaks well for the performance of the product."
5,Great unit,Used this unit with a hot pot for heating water to wash dishes while camping at Shaver Lake.The unit more than met my expectations. My wife and daughter-in-law are happy I purchased this unit.
1,It is a piece a junk,"I tried to heat up a bucket of cold water when I first received it. It took me an hour and still no hot water. At the end, I tried to boil the cold water on the stove. Please do not buy it."
1,No Satisfied,"I followed the instructions to the letter and this heater will not work as described. I'm sticking to propane. I would have returned it, but trashed the box before I tested the heater. NOT RECOMMENDED."
1,"Stopped working for sous vide, and anything else","I love my sous vide machine, but my crock pot was just a little too small for the larger cuts of meat I wanted to cook. This seemed like the perfect solution - in my case I had a pot deep enough for this heater to work (double measure your pots - I thought I had 3 but only 1 was over 8 inches tall), and I was looking forward to cooking larger amounts of food. It worked perfectly the first 2 times, but then continued to draw heat - overloading the off circuit of my thermostat (which still worked perfectly when attached to the crock pot). Fine, my mistake - until my water heater broke and I needed it to heat bathwater for the kids. The bucket water heater generated bubbles but absolutely no heat."
4,write the title your self,"Hey, I rated it, OK I am not going to write a book. No more words like it or not. I am discused with you guys and your password crap to write an answer, not to mention the longer password required."
3,its working its better,its not that good as i expected but its working the only thing is takes time to heat up one bucket of water.
5,great product,"well im very happy with this product, i have been using it this winter in a 400 gallon concrete water trough. i had some tropical fish in an aquarium and they out grew it so i was forced to put them in there. even though im in texas that trough will freeze over easily in the winter, so i was looking for a heater and this was the only one that always worked, others wouldnt turn on till the air temp was 35 degrees which by then the fish would have died. so i got this one, during the freezes it keeps the water fairly cool, and the fish are doing excellent instead of cramped in a little aquarium. id say the water temp hasnt got bellow 60 degrees because if it did the fish would have died"
5,Works Great For The Price,"I use this for all grain beer making when the weather is too cold to use propane outside . Normally it would take around 2 hours for my wimpy stovetop to bring 7 gallons of wort to a boil , but with the aid of this baby I can do it in 45 minutes , which is a huge improvement . Haven't had any problems with scorching . The way it is designed it circulates liquid while it heats it . For the price it can't be beat !"
5,Gets water hot.,"The heater on my hot tub broke right before a party, so I used two of these to heat the hot tub instead.It worked great--they brought the water from room temperature up to 120 (oops!) over the course of a day (something like 8-10 hours?). We had to let it cool down a little before anyone could get in. We didn't want to leave bucket heaters in the water while people were using the hot tub for safety reasons, so once people got in, we moved the bucket heaters into 5-gallon buckets of water right next to it. That gave us a constant supply of hot (nearly boiling) water to refresh it with every half hour or so. We were easily able to maintain a ~100-104 degree range in the hot tub all night, although it did require a little bit of finessing.Note that these draw 8.3 amps each, so you can't run two of them on a 15 amp circuit at the same time."
3,Works OK,I had thought the heater would work a bit faster. It takes about three hours to heat the amount of gallons in the font. I am OK with waiting for the water to become warm enough.
4,Works great,"Had it for two months now. I've used it 5-10 times a week, and its worked every time. I wish it had a on//off switch on the cord, but other than that I couldn't be happier"
4,Didn't get a Marshalltown heater but this one works....,"My husband is in construction and is familiar with the brand Marshalltown, which is why we ordered this heater. We have a prime account so its' delivery in 2 days was going to coincide perfectly with the day he needed to use it at a particular job. We opened the box to find a ""generic"" water heater. No name on the box (certainly not Marshalltown). Because he had to use it the next day, we had no choice but to keep it. From what he tells me it's working fine, but the fact that Amazon/the seller has sent us a no-name brand in place of the one we ordered and paid for is absolutely infuriating. This has happened to us before......the item we received was not the brand we ordered. I don't know whose fault it is, but it would be nice if someone at Amazon would read this and make an effort to make sure they're shipping what they are advertising."
4,"Good, but try Volume 2","While there is some terrific playing on this disc, it is on the later, volumes 2 & 3 of this set that Rollins settles into his stint at Ronnie Scott's and takes off. This one's not worth the high price-- the other two volumes are, and are not as expensive at the time of this writing. Also, for excellent live Rollins, see the recently reissued There Will Never Be Another You, recorded at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965."
4,Unknown with amazing potential,Stumbled across this unknown artist - lots of great potential. You can hear a bit of Lennon and Floyd influences....
3,A story from England,"As many books, the main story of the book (when you can find it) is very good, but it has to many stories that are out of the story and that make a heavy book to read.The main story has inside another story and with both stories (that at the end of the book both of them has the same finish) you will read about how was the life in England in 1714 and how began the stock exchange in that country."
3,How to make history come alive.,"David Liss has written a great first book about a time in history that very few know anything about. His descriptions of place and his people development is very vivid. This novel reminded me that there is very little that is new in this world. The financial world has become more technically sophisticated, but the basic physchology is the same. David Liss has taken the stage with other notable, but somewhat forgotten authors such as Costain and SamuelShellabarger.I can't wait to read more of his work in the hopefully near future."
3,"Fabolous, realistic, and original background, routine unimaginative forground","There is a weired sort of internal contradiction going on in this Novel. The author has in depth knowledge of early 18th England. Very different from the kind of shallow research that one would have find if the author was not an academic expert to begin with. Therefore, there is a fascinating realism in book's depiction of life in London as one would experience it at 1720. Superimposed on this structure is a rather routine and standard murder mystery. The only interesting part of that murder mystery is the internal conflict in private detective's mind about his Jewish heritage. The rest of the mystery: physical fights with swords, fists, and pistols, murders, implausible and unrealistic twists and turns...etc are the usual stuff that one can see if you go to your local book store and pick a book at random from the mystery section."
4,A Splendid Novel,"It is truly amazing to know that this is David Liss's first novel. He writes with expertise using much of the language of 18th century England, only toning it down a bit in order to be understood in the 20th century. It is the same sort of genius as that of A.S. Byatt in POSSESSION, whose nineteenth century poetry seemed so genuine.I loved hearing the Dickens-like details of existence in London at that time. It is hard to imagine life in an other-wise sophisticated society to be so lacking in plumbing; police with little authority; bribeable judges and un-speakable prisons.The plot seemed a bit complicated to me, but I understood the general idea and found Liss's writing supurb. I can hardly wait for his next novel."
5,Terrific historical mystery,It always amazes me when an author's first novel is as well written as is this book. I hope Mr Liss has a long and successful career. He has written an absorbing and intricate thriller with a lesson for today's stock market investors. The more things change....Do yourself a favor and read this book.
5,"Fun, fun fun!","What a super first novel! This novel has it all: Pugilists, English anti-semitism, thieves, murder mystery--and an easy-to-follow lesson in the origins of the stock market to boot! Very fun read, good summer book."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a disappointment. The concept was interesting and there was a lot of historical information. However, the book as a whole fell flat for me. I found much of the narrative dragged on for too long, and finished the book feeling as though I had wasted my time."
3,Almost But Not Quite,"I found it interesting that the author thanked all sorts of people for help in writing this book but he neglected to mention those wonderful 18th century British writers that he is trying to emulate.The historical clothespins are there and these nice tidbits fly up every few pages. But the main thing I expected to see was some of the humor and fun that are available in Fielding, Sterne and DeFoe for example.This is my favorite period of history and while I realize that violence was different then than now, I do think there was more of a lust for life that David Liss misses. He should try again -- in fewer pages, and with a lighter tone -- to bring us the glory of the past."
2,"I wanted to like it, but . . .","I usually like historical mysteries, but this was a major disappointment for 2 reasons:1. the financial information, though needed for the plot to make sense, is not sufficiently integrated into the story. Further, it's so cumbersome and detailed that it becomes boring when it should have been fascinating.2. the protagonist's relationship with his father is unrealistic for the time period. Late 16th-early 17th century fathers were not usually -- or even frequently -- touchy-feely affectionate types. They were authority figures. And the hero's comments about his father's lack of affection for him make him seem self-pitying."
2,"Wow, was I disappointed......","I am still scratching my head over all the great reviews of this book that I read here on Amazon.com. I was tremendously disappointed. I seem to be in the minority, but I wouldn't recommend this book.Maybe it was the fact that I took an instant dislike to the main character, and that dislike continued throughout the book. Or perhaps it was the very busy plot that spiraled around so many times that by the end I really didn't care who the was the culprit. I just wanted the book to end. But the worst part for me was the writing style. I just didn't care for it at all, and found it to be stilted throughout.I feel like I should be apologetic since so many people did like this book and many of the newspapers liked it too, but I just didn't care for it."
5,unexpectedly riveting--have been recommending this to everyone!,"How exciting can early 1700's London be? Quite--which I did not expect at all. I was tremendously impressed at how nimbly Liss wove history into this mystery. Aside from being heartily entertained (and staying up too late to finish), I was delighted to come across some tidbits of etymology: the root of ""double-cross"" and the unexpected meanings of ""ordinary"" and ""clapped."" This book was a pleasure, and slyly educational. I know my English history much better now, thanks to this novel!"
4,In the same class as Sansom and Pears,"I guess I came late to David Liss, but reading this debut, I know I'll read more of his books. Nice story, brings 18th century London very much to life, well written. Kept me up till 3 am one regular work day - enough said."
4,"Very well written, if a bit convoluted","Based on the reviews I had read and my love of accurate historical fiction, I was anxious to read this book. I was not dissapointed. I particularly liked the treatment of latent and explicit anti-semitism in relatively Jewish-friendly England. The main character, Benjamin Weaver, is well-described and has a remarkable amount of flaws and strengths. He is interesting and his first-person take/memoirs is a highly readable approach to view life in the early 1700s in sprawling London. The core element of the book, rampant ""stock jobbing"" and associated crimes is interesting, if a bit convoluted and sometimes a bit of a stretch to follow. But all-in-all, the book is very good--especially given it is the author's first novel."
5,Couldn't put it down,"There are so few books of the mystery/thriller genre today that have interesting character development and historical/cultural context. This book has both and is entirely engrossing as a result. Add in the mystery, and I couldn't put it down (totally destroyed a good night's sleep).COP is of particular interest in this day and age, as parallels can be drawn between the stock market mentality then and today.COP was entertaining, educational and memorable."
3,Why couldn't it have been 100 pages shorter?,"Don't get me wrong...it's a good story but it goes on and on and on with details that do little or nothing to move the story. I don't mind descriptions about meals and wine and clothes and the weather but please, at almost 500 pages, leave some of it out so the reader doesn't get bogged down and beg for some action. I read ""The Devil's Company"" first...it's much better. Clearly the author picked up the pace in later books. What I did like: it's very, very contemporary despite its 18th century setting."
2,"Some thoughts upon reading ""Conspiracy of Paper""","David Liss has written an historical thriller of the swash buckling type concerning England's South Sea Company Bubble of 1720. Liss did Dumas up proud. Having said that, one can hardly imagine a more complex plot nor a greater cast of nondescript characters that this author brought into being. What could have been accomplished with a good editor defies the imagine. To paraphrase Margaret Atwood; one bought the admission ticket, now one wants to see how it ends. So with this book; one cannot put it down `till all the ends are pulled together. This never happened! The major problem I had was that I was disappointed in not finding that ending."
4,Fine historic mystery,"This is a great mystery, set in 18th century England. The protagonist is perhaps the most likeable I've seen in years."
2,NOT great,"OK, the financial mystery around which this novel is built captured my interest. But the main character is quite unsympathetic; his sidekick, his love interest, and many of the supporting characters are cardboard. One does not become immersed in the period the way one does in, say, the novels of E.L. Doctorow or William J. Kennedy. The ""detective wisdom"" dispensed by the characters is pretty tame stuff. The dialogue is alright (that is, it doesn't get in the way of the story), but it's hard to imagine some of it coming out of anyone's mouth, no matter when they lived. There are red herrings, plot twists, and all of that good stuff.This is definitely light entertainment and nothing more. Sorry to disagree with so many other reviewers. Truth in reviewing: I didn't read this book, I listened to it on tape - I don't think my reaction is due to a tepid reading, rather I was quite impressed by the rendition (I've listened to some real dogs on the way to work)."
3,The Conspiracy Paper,The similarities of this book with The Whiskey Rebels made the read distracting. The author has a hang up with the stock market. Are all his books a course in the market?
5,I really liked this book.,This novel sheds some light on the caracte Weaver and other books from the same author over and above being well told story.
1,Creaky and hamfisted,"An exciting premise, well-researched and detailed, but with the story mechanics of a seventh grade short story. Things like ""...but he had no idea that the person he had just seen would change his life forever..."" (not a quote, but you get the idea). Wished I'd waited for the paperback!"
1,A Conspiracy of Paper,I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the book. I believed I was ordering a hardcover when in fact I got a large print library edition.
4,A Good Read,"I really enjoyed this book although I do agree with the other reviewer who said it was a bit too drawn out. Nevertheless, the author has certainly done his homework with regard to life in 18th century London. I also appreciated the parallels between the economy then and now. The South Sea bubble was about to burst and the economy was built on air. It just goes to show you that history does repeat itself."
3,Debut novel is entertaining but not very memorable,"I read this debut novel by David Liss - a historical novel set in the London of the early 1700s, and dealing with a number of con games setting on the then nascent stock exchange - some years ago, not knowing anything about the writer. The book is a fast read, despite not being a short book at all, and it's quite entertaining. But you are not likely to remember a lot about it after a while - it's exciting to read, well researched, but not very memorable."
5,E.L. Burton Author of $oft Money writes....Fantastic,"As a writer and avid reader, I found this book to be simply Fantastic. The scenes and stage of this novel were fascinating. The characters were well written, I grew to both love and despise them. I found the historical perspective to be both vivid and accurate. If this is the first book by David Liss, I look forward to reading his future work."
2,Tiresome Period Style,"Liss attempts to tell the story first person, but his early 17th century prose is as dead as synthetic meat. It lacks wit, style, humor, nuance, and a hundred other ingredients of good writing. The only time I laughed out loud is when I read the interview at the back of the book, and the interviewer claimed the book was funny.The novel also fails structurally. The plot meanders between conventional crime thriller and clumsy history lessons. By the end, I was reading out of duty. Enough said.Two stars for effort."
3,A Good if Repetetive Read,"This book definitely kept me turning the pages. Liss does a nice job of painting a historical backdrop for his novel and gives us a likeable protagonist to lead us through the maze of late 18th century London financial and social underworlds. The book repeatedly returns to the raw anti-semitism presumably present in 18th century London as a source for dialogue and character development, and it becomes a bit tiresome at points. In lieu of an otherwise excellent story, that might be nitpicking, this book is certainly a high-caliber mystery, historical fiction, action novel worth every penny."
4,Informative and Lots of Fun,"The first stock market bubble in the English speaking world bursts in this historically accurate novel that takes place in early 18th century England. Without being overly ornate (which I appreciated), the writing comes across as authentic for the period and there is a wealth of fascinating history in this quite fun to read book. I wish I knew ahead of time that many of Liss's colorful characters are based on real people. The book was great regardless but it would have added another dimension. There is an ""elementary my dear Watson"" element to the conclusion of the very tangled plot, one that is realistic in the way that fact can unfortunately be stranger than fiction. I will certainly read all of Liss's books. Am hoping the next is whittled down just a tad."
5,Historical Fiction at its best...,"This is nearly a perfect work of historical fiction!! I loved every page...the plot unfolded masterfully, yet held your suspense until the very end. The amount of historical detail to religious prejudice, the new and emerging financial markets, fashion, classes difference and social mores was vast, yet so beautifully woven into the story line. Plus, you really do love the protagonist!! Do read...you won't be sorry!!"
2,weak,"I cannot see how this book won any award. The story is OK at first but really gets bogged down in a lot of useless detail, the thread is tough to follow at times, and by the 3/4 mark, I just plain lost interest in finding out why and who killed Weaver's father. Characters are not all that interesting. There are plenty of good historical novels out there, but this is not one of them."
3,Talented Writer...Tedious Plot,"This book has received over 100 reviews so I will not summarize the plot as I usually do.I personally thought that this was more a showcase of the author's strong command of the English language rather than an engaging mystery. Believe me when I say Liss is a very talented and well-researched writer. His first person narrative effectively sweeps you back in time to 18th century London amid an atmosphere of money, greed and deceit. His style is so beautiful it is almost poetic. Unfortunately I wanted a thriller, a true ""action-packed"" piece -- and this fell woefully short of that in my humble opinion. Even after the first 150 pages the story seemed painfully stretched, and idle in many spots, but that doesn't mean it is not worth a buy; a true fan of historical fiction will not be disappointed with the author's writing. I just prefer a faster pace.3 stars for absolutely beautiful narration...minus 2 for a tedious unraveling of the plot."
5,Definitely Worth Reading!,"David Liss is to be highly commended on his first novel. A Conspiracy Of Paper has it all -- very well developed and interesting characters (particularly Benjamin Weaver), an exciting and mysterious plot, an ability to make early 18th century London come alive for the reader,and a compelling historical perspective of the London stock market in its infancy, the criminal underworld, the powerful business elite and of anti-semitism. There is no question about the depth of research that Liss conducted to write this book, but what makes A Conspiracy Of Paper so special is the way he successfully manages to weave all of this research into a novel that will have you totally engrossed and glued to your seat. Do yourself a favor and read this book as soon as possible. I think you'll definitely enjoy the trip back in time!"
2,Unsatisfying,"This is what happens when graduate students indulge in work avoidance. If you are interested in the history of the South Seas Bubble, Chancellor's ""Devil Take the Hindmost"" is a better read. If you are interested in the 18th century milieu, then Mount's ""Sam (and Jem)"" and Unsworth's ""Sacred Hunger"" bracket the times and mores. If you are interested in what Soro's calls ""reflexivity"", how financial innovations influenced the period and vice versa, then perhaps wait for Liss's disseration... and if you just want historical mystery, Bruce Alexander works better."
4,Financial Fiction,"Reviewer Lee Armstrong suggests that David Liss may have invented a new genre of ""financial thrillers."" Au contraire! There are hundreds of books in this category, or at least in the ""financial fiction"" category (many of them, like Black Money, definitely thrillers).For a listing of books in this genre, see http://www.ex.ac.uk/~RDavies/bankfiction/ which also has links to""Money in History"" and ""Financial Scandals."" Happy searching!"
2,A ridiculously labyrinthine plot,"I love historical mysteries, and this one came highly recommended. I did enjoy the period touches. But imagine my disappointment when I finally get to the end of the book and discover that the plot was based on a complicated and ultimately unbelievable premise of various parties working to manipulate the hero to do their bidding. (When those parties could have taken care of their problem just as easily by themselves!) It required several PAGES at the end for the characters to explain the solution to each other! This tortured, convoluted plot is ultimately laughable.To make matters worse, the hero, a former pugilist, goes about finding out information primarily by pummeling people until they spill the truth. Too bad he didn't just beat up the right people early on in the book -- it would have saved the hero (not to mention the readers) a lot of wasted time."
2,Disappointing after all the strong reviews,"I did not feel as strong a sense that this author knew his period as I have from such recent historical novels as, say, The Dress Lodger. But what really frustrates me in a mystery is when the detective does not follow obvious trails or makes nothing of pretty strong hints. For example, Weaver had the manuscript of his father's book in his possession and knew it probably related to his death. Did he read it? No, it made him sleepy! Then someone stole it from him. Why not make it more difficult for him to get the manuscript in the first place than have him ignore it? There were many incidents like this throughout the book. If there is anything that makes me impatient, it is a stupid detective."
5,"Easy enough for a beginner, Skilled enough for a star!","The break-down format of this DVD is one of the things that makes it so great. It breaks down moves - smooth, percussive, travelling steps, and so on, making it easier to focus on a particular type of move. There is a warm-up and cool down, a performance piece in the end, and some other great tips, tools, moves, and techniques to improve belly dancers at any skill level. For beginners, each move is broken down and through the power of repitition and easy explanations, you'll have it down in no time! I have this DVD and have used it for a few years as a regular exercise and just for fun! Because of the types of moves belly dance uses, this is a great DVD additional to any dancer's collection! At about an hour in length, it's the perfect length for nap time, a quick work-out, or just about any time in your day!"
1,"so what is it, really?","is it a chair? is it a bed? the product features say it's a twin bed with a metal bed frame. the name of the product describes it only as a chair, and there's nothing else in the accompanying information to help a customer sort out that confusion. so do we see the product listing, and just sit on it? or put it to sleep?"
3,An interesting read,"I found this to be an interesting read, all things considered. It is in a style that I normally don't read and I was not sure how much I would like it, but by the end I found it to be overall a good story. To me the story felt a little disconnected and slow at the start but the author quickly caught his stride. I found that I'd put it down but then, curious to know what happened next on Dennis's journey to manhood, I'd soon pick it up and read a bit more.The events and places were more fanciful than inpatient things I read - at times it felt like I was reading someone's dream and at others their nightmare."
3,Not necessarily adult reading,Very well written but intended more for a teenager than an adult. The book is very descriptive but much too heavy in fantasy to be believable.
5,The sea hag,This was a good book I wish it was longer and had more vivid detailBut all in all it was a good book.
4,Sea Hag,Very good yarnI would recommend it for all ages.I like A book that evil and good are clearly defined
1,Strange,This book had trouble holding my interest. Usually I can read a book at one setting but not this one.
3,"Prince Dennis on a quest, a quest for life and honor","Prince Dennis was to be sacrificed, well at least delivered to the Sea Hag as the first born of King Hale. In incautious agreement , before the birth of the Crystal palace with it's safe harbour ( The only safe harbour on the north coast). Dennis in the company of his little 40 lb robot named Chester has decided to leave the kingdom if he can get past the dragons guarding the castle.This is an interesting tale, lizard men, dragons, sea hags and robots? some the tech concept works within the story. The only caveats are that there only appears to be a single book in what is to be a series."
3,A nice try to imitate Furtwängler.,"Mr.Barenboim is undoubtedely one of the best interpreters of Wagner's music, as he is of Beethoven and the Great German Masters. But , listening to his interpretation of Tristan, the great test being The Prelude to Act 3. And all of act 3. He really does not have the measure of the music. At least not in this recording, several years old as it is.He might have matured somewhat during the last few years.But that is most doubtful, as his heavy studying of Furtwängler,has , as yet, proved of an advancement of a slight measure.As Barenboim knows far better than anyone else, there will be no other Furtwängler. At best, someone will emerge; but that is notin the foreseeable future, and perhaps most doubtful."
2,"Well, um, nobody can sing their parts","I wonder if Barenboim isn't being near-sighted as a Wagner conductors, someone who doesn't apparently care if his singres can comfortably sing their parts. All that has ever mattered to him is getting ""his"" Ring cycle on to CD, along with everything else in the Wagner canon.This Tristan is typical of the results to be heard elsewhere: wayward conducting, excellent sound, great orchestral work, and embarrassing if earnest singing. Jerusalem and Meier, both noted soloists, are so overparted here it isn't even funny, but then, so are all the singers in every single Barenboim Wagner opera, with few exceptions. What a waste..."
2,two star rating is generous!,"I have seen and heard tristan Und Isolde performances which had either a poor tristan or one that just got through the evening. I remember three tenors at Nilsson's Met debut...But here we have a perfectly intelligent artist, Waltraud Meier,all together out of her class giving the worst performance of Isolde on record.Who told this artist she could sing one of the most demanding roles ever written. A mezzo soprano no less??!!Is Barenboim out there or what?Doesn't anyone listen? Maybe we are really about money!"
1,Bluegrass Battery/ Battery Jack,"This is a review of the web provider Bluegrass Battery listed on the Amazon site. I ordered two Tripp Lite RBC52 replacement batteries for my UPS (recommended by manufacturer). Bluegrass offered the best price. After more than two months, two wrong shipments and their return, and many emails, I finally have confirmation of a refund, less $13 for shipping and handling. The second battery shipment they insist was what I ordered according to their stock numbers could not fit upright in the battery compartment, was 2 Ah less in capacity, and required custom rewiring. This is what they insist is the correct replacement."
1,Tripp Lite Co are Spineless,"They advertise their UPS units as having user replaceable batteries and they sell the user replaceable batteries. Email them on how to connect them, they will tell you NOTHING, policy from the the President!! Spineless management won't stand behind their own products, because their afraid of liability. Can you imagine if car makers took the same approach, they wouldn't provide you with an owners manual!!"
2,Lacking In Practical Examples,"I purshcased this book looking for a desk reference for Visual Basic 6 and found that this book was realy not sufficent in providing anything more than a brief description of VB 6 functions. It does cover a ASP's adaquatly for a refrence, but I've found Visual Basic 6 Little Black Book, by Steven Holzner to be a more complete reference guide."
2,Not as Advertised,I purchased these boxer's as a support brief for cycling. They provided no support and the stiching rubs the skin raw. I would not recommend these for any athletic activity. When I contacted the company I was essentialy blown off. I will not buy anything from this company again!
3,OK,"This product is ok. They don't seem to fit quite right. Based upon reviews I order a size bigger than needed, but don't fit right. Had higher hopes for this product."
5,Even better than the first!,"After seeing the first Madagascar in theaters with my family, I thought it was a really good movie! I enjoyed it and felt it was well done. However... my first thought was that 'sequels are never quite as good as the first.' However... after seeing Madagascar 2, I have been proven wrong! In adulthood, the first time I saw this movie, I was laughing so hard that I cried! I LOVE this movie! I cannot say enough good things about it! Can be enjoyed by all ages, children and adults alike! Everyone takes their own view of the movie! With hidden adult humor mixed in with a light hearted tale of family, friendship, and loyalty, this movie will be a classic for years to come! Even better than the first movie! I love that I can sit in a room of children and teenagers and enjoy this movie as much as I would with a room of adults! Truly another amazing movie!!"
5,Madagascar 2 is great.,I loved Madagascar 2; the animation is great and it is just a lot of fun to watch. I get a real kick out of Nana.
3,like,"Good quality, and my daughter loved this movie. It is also a movie that adults can watch with their kids"
4,widescreen - dvd - Madagascar II,"I ordered two copies of this DVD because my daughter, grandson and I love this movie. However, it is not widescreen. I could tolerate that but the DVD does not allow me to skip the previews, nor does it stop at the end of the movie. The DVD returns immediately to the beginning of the movie and restarts itself. We enjoy that feature but also realize DVDs are not supposed have that feature. So, while the movie is hilarious and entertaining, the DVD was a disappointment.Thank you."
3,Not quite up to the cut of the first.,"Funny movie that had some great parts for kids and adults. Not a side-splitting funny movie, but worth to watch if there's nothing else on."
4,SOLID SEQUEL FUN FOR KIDS AND ADULTS!,I am a sucker for a good animated film and the original Madagascar was a very good example of the genre. This sequel retains the charm of the original even if we feel we've been there before. The animation is stellar and the voice work inspired in this colorful film. I love the pop culture references and sometimes wonder if these films are made for adults or children. Fortunately this film works for both!
3,Very Entertaining; Actually 3.5 Stars.,"It's value lies on the entertainment contents and the great graphics/CGI. For this only it is worth watching. However, the story is unoriginal and predictable, and thus subtracts from the value of the movie. There are some - uncalled for- scenes, like a marriage ceremony between one of the penguins and a doll. They also subtract from the family value of the movie."
5,Great for the whole family,Everyone in my family loves this movie!! We recommend anyone who wants a good laugh to watch this great movie.
5,a great cartoon,these madagascar is as good as the first one i enjoyed it very much i would recommend these to family and adults as well will enjoy it as well
4,Kids love it... so do I!,The kids never got tired of this movie so it was worth it to buy. I thought it was better than the first Madagascar. It's still funny after watching over 20 times..
3,could have been much better,"Around the 50 minute mark I found myself bored with this movie. It had just gone no where and had become tedious. Wheres the jokes? Theres a lot spent on building up the story, which is hardly a story. The main plot seems to be abandoned by the movie altogether for a coming home of the ""lion king"". A major subplot about a damn is finalized with little to do, various subplots are more interesting but neither here nor there. Did they even story-board this movie or just the parts?Each subsequent happening made me beg for less plot and more jokes? Admit it, its a comedy and were the jokes fun and quick to come, no one would care about the failures of any plot. Here we don't even get that. Sigh.All said, its not a bad movie and probably fine for a light viewing. To me it seemed like a so-so effort that had a lot of potential but left me bored.ps: The male hippo was sleazy and gross. Frankly not believable as an attractive mate for the girl."
5,Good Movie,Good-looking Blu-Ray. I like this one better than #2. Though my five-year-old seems to like #2 better.
5,Hugely entertaining!!!,This a replacement because my first one wore out from being played so much by my two five year old grandsons.Grandma even liked it. Kept the kids attention throughout the whole movie. Need to watch the first Madagascar to relate this one to New York. Good clean entertainment for anyone.
3,Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,This was a cute movie and I think children would enjoy it. The night I watched it I was wanting a funny movie
5,Funny,"My husband and I watched the movie, and enjoyed it very much. Kind of a neat thing to say, especially at our age as senior citizens."
4,HAHAHAHA!,"Sequels are hardly ever as good as the original. Films tend to fall into this category very easily. However, I have to say that Madagascar 2 was better than the first one. This movie was so funny, tears were running down my face for much of the film. I was laughing so hard. I truly recommend it. It's one of those movies that has humor that works for both children and adults."
2,Could have been better,The story line is not impressive. It seems that it has been put together in a hurry. It really suffers from the bad sequel syndrome. It is fun but not the quality which Pixar or Dreamworks is expected to put. Looks like some third grade studio's apprentice-like effort. The visuals are good. Penguins are upto their notoreity and the old lady is bashing poor Alex... donno why!!! Some un-natural romantic angles also come up... and the ever irritating king julian is there to move it move it..
4,very funny!,"Love the Penguins and the funny voices behind them. Great story! The brightest point of the whole movie is ""Sasha Baron Cohen"" and his weird Indian accent. Very funny! Your kids will like this and even adults might enjoy this good animation."
4,Fun movie for Kids,My kids like the series. Not as good as 1 and 3 but fun and gets you from 1 to 3.
2,Subtle racism,"While I think the reviewer who insists the phrase ""crack-a-lackin'"" is somehow a racist comment (ridiculous!), I do have some issues with the subtle racism of this film. Moto-moto (voiced by a black actor) likes Gloria (voiced by a black actress) because she has a big butt. The other characters can't tell the zebras (voiced by a black actor) apart because they all look the same. I'm surprised they didn't find a way to have these characters eat watermelon and fried chicken or something.This film has its clever moments (the first 5 or 10 minutes are completely hilarious!), but it's not nearly as good as the first. And the racism is a complete turn-off."
1,Garbage,"I couldn't watch much of this because it has so many disgusting things in it. My husband watched it to the end and said to get rid of it. It went into the garbage immediately. It looks like a lot of fun on the outside, but the content of this movie is disturbing at the least."
4,Gift for the grandkids,Got this for my grandkids for easter and they have watched it a couple dozen times
5,Satisfied customer,"The DVD was received very timely and the quality was great. My great grandson and I enjoyed it very much and will probably watch it again and again. Good doing business with you, keep up the good work. I am sure at some point you will be hearing from me again."
3,Not as toddler friendly the first one,"My husband and I enjoyed this but our son just keeps wanting to watch the first one. This one is more adult, the opening scenes were a little troubling for our son (lion cub kidnapped by very scary poacher types - daddy tries to save him and is shot by the poachers - then baby lion screams for daddy as baby lion floats in a box down a river alone...)"
4,I lost it like a kid!!!,The individual characters kept me at a-laugh-a-minute! My all time favorites are the penquins... I wish I could be as cool as them ;-)
4,Very funny,My kids and I had a blast watching this movie. It was better than I expected and the humor was generally appropriate though there were a few scenes which I could have done without.
2,Too much hype,"I am very disappointed with this movie. The first movie, like most movies, was excellent. My toddler loves it and it is some what appropriate for him. We counted down the days until were we able to but the second so we could finally see it.I watched this one with him for the first time and was blown away by the violence. Within minutes of the movie, a gun was being aimed at a lion cub.It also has adult human throughout and the violent acts are just looking to be imitated.And the plot, well, I think that Dream Works could have come up with something better than imitating the Lion King.The first was an incredible movie and I am so sad that the second is not as good as the first."
1,Item never received,"I never received the item. Even though it was supposedly mailed out in a timely manner, after approx. 21 days I contact vendor through Amazon to let them know item never received. Even with tracking info provided, I never got it. I was very disappointed and am still waiting to receive my refund."
1,dont use these guys!,"DVD cracked upon receipt, emailed 3 times. Said they would return item and send another..... that was over a month ago! Hate to leave a bad review, but I gave them ample time to remedy the situation, and the ""said"" they would. :("
1,Very upset...,First of all we recieved no product. It was a great price so we thought to buy it but we waited along time and never got a response from the seller. We were upset because it was for our kids.
1,DO NOT USE THIS SELLER!!!!!,It has been a week past the last delevery date and no product. I have sent two emails to the seller and heard nothing. I found another review of a customer with the same experiance. Please for your own sake DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER!!!
2,A Children's Movie With Racist Comments,"This movie, while entertaining, has a racist theme. The phrase ""cracker lackin"" is uttered again and again. Can you imagine the contoversy, if this were an equivilent racial slur against black, or any non-white race of people? I suppose that ""cracker lackin"" means ""a place without white people,"" because of the context that it is used in. Because of its repeated use, I have deducted two stars. I deducted one more because the movie was not as entertaining as the original."
4,Nana's opinion,Madagascar - Escape 2 Africa (Widescreen)I found Madagascar 2 just as funny and exciting as Madagascar 1. My grandson knows every song and every character and he's only 3. The clarity and sharpness of the movie helped also. All in all I found the movie to be excellent.
5,Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,This is the widescreen edition. It's a great dvd. We love and now own all of the movies. Highly recommended!
1,madagascar2,"not great, kids did not really enjoy it. they are 7 and 6yrs their comments were its boring and not too funny"
2,very poor quality,The video came in a ripped package. I did not have a chance to preview it until a few days later and it was very poor quality. It crackled and turned black in many parts and was just overall very poor...I bought this for my grandchildren and I cannot show it to them because of the terrible quality.
1,Madagascar 2 was made for adults watching with their kids rather than kids,Like the first Madagascar I question who they made this movie for. This movie is particularly rich in adult humor that kids don't get. For example the movie explores animals reproduction in the most understanding method (sarcastic) for the hippos that involves a hip-hop party with stylish hippos picking up superficial sex partners at a pool-side gathering with Big-and-Chunky playing.I don't think this is really a kids movie. It is just a silly cartoon.
2,Disappointed,"I was very excited to see that the sequel was available and I ordered it, signt unseen, in anticipation of a wonderful animated comedy. I should have rented this dvd before I actually purchased it. The story line was very thin and they seemed to rely more on crude banter than they did on the story line. The old lady character was apparently a poor effort to provide some more humor but it made little sense. I absolutely loved Madagascar but this sequel left me very disappointed. Perhaps if I had not seen the first one I would have rated this one a 3 star but I doubt it."
4,"Entertaining animation feature, LOVED ""Nana!""","In this second DVD we look at the continuing adventures of the refugees from New York's Central Park Zoo, this time in a nature preserve in Africa proper. Of course, to get there they had to trust the penguins to fly them there, which was a mistake to begin with.Needless to say, Africa isn't all they expected. Add in a little old lady from New York and you have some serious entertainment."
3,not as good as blue ray,"blue ray was better to dark, once you go blue ray you never go back animation is better in blue ray on any big screen t.v.,"
4,A Stellar Stiller & Friends Epic,"Not a monumental film, but it's got Chris Rock, it's dedicated to Bernie Mac, and it's more fun adventures with the same characters from the previous movie. Would I watch it again, or recommend to a friend? Well, I really like the DreamWorks Jukebox bonus feature -- it's slow and cloogie (sp?), but packed with lots of fun tracks. If DreamWorks made a complete video collection that I could just put on rotate for my daughters to sing and dance along to, I would definitely buy it. The Kung Fu Fighting video from Kung Fu Panda is awesome, the kids in there have some fun dance steps. You're right, you're right, I should actually watch the whole movie before making a review. Well, maybe I'll update it after I do."
2,Disappointed,I got this movie for my grandkids overnighter for them to watch and we were all disappointed.It wasn't really that much of a movie for children. They were ages 4 to 12 and they didn't like the movie.We all loved the previous movie but this one missed it by far.
3,Challenging,"I had never attempted a round puzzle before, and it was challenging. ALL the pieces have angled edges, and it took some getting used to. The background of blue stars is tedious and slow-going, it took me a long time to finish once I got the central figure completed. If you are doing this for a gift or have a deadline for finishing it, you should allow more time than you would for a conventional straight-edged project. However, when finished, this is a beautiful piece. I had mine mounted with an off-white mat and barnwood style frame. I chose barnwood to complement the lamb and shepherd theme of the puzzle."
5,Martial Arts Okonomiyaki...,"...now I've seen it all. (Of course, knowing Takahashi, there is probably a LOT more that is stranger than this!) Ukyo Kuonji was a childhood friend of Ranma's, but when he left for China, Ukyo wanted revenge. Armed with flour bombs, deep dish glue, rubber yakisoba noodles, and a human-size (literally) spatula, Ukyo tracks down Ranma and changes him to a fight on a ring surrounded by a hot plate.But Ukyo is hiding something, and there is something else that Genma Saotome forget to mention to his son...And Ryoga gets a fiancee!"
3,Disappointing,"Received this candle as a gift and was so excited. I'm really disappointed, however, with the way it is burning. It will only burn for about an hour before it goes out and it is burning down just in the center of candle.11/6/12I contacted the Woodwick company about this candle and they are issuing a replacement. I have upgraded to 3 stars."
3,Stubborn wick,"While the scent of this candle is marvelous, I did have problems with the wick not burning to maximum potential. I had to remove some melted wax so that the wick would not drown in its own melted wax."
5,Educational and fun,"My first grader loves math so much that we decided to enrich his education. We bought both second and third grade brainquests, and these are great fun. We read them while he is getting read for bed and traveling around in the car. He asks for them at night, so either he wants to stay up longer or he really is enjoying them."
4,"great cartoon for nostalgia fans, but beware if you already own series","I love this show; I used to watch it all the time as a kid. I still think Lorenzo as the voice of Garfield was by far the best. This is a summary of shows from the series Garfield and Friends.Beware if you already own the tv series on dvd, however. These are taken directly from the series, so you are basically just having the convenience of skipping directly to the garfield cartoon from the US Acres cartoons and the shorts.I'm a fan and the price was still nice for me to own this summary dvd and the tiny beanie baby garfield, but stay away otherwise."
3,Very cute!,Good product - the beanie Garfield is very cute. DVD is very funny but that's just Garfield for you!
1,AVOID Cingular at all cost!,If you want to spend countless hours on the phone being transfered from department to department and having to explain your whole story over and over again. Each time the rep promises to fix the problem and call you back. I've yet to get a call back from any of them. I wish I could email the CEO. Please save yourself the headache and go with another carrier.
1,Adhesive left itchy rash,"I tried a patch on my lower back and at first it felt great and helped my back pain. After wearing it for a few hours the skin under the patch started to get very itchy. I took it off and my skin was bumpy and red. It's been 3 days since I used it and my skin is still red, patchy, and irritated. I don't normally have sensitive skin but something in the adhesive of this product was not good for me."
2,passing through,"I wanted to listen to a good recording of Wenn wir in höchsten Nöten sein. This is not it.Here's what I found: it's a muddy recording (music is indistinct when it gets loud or low) and the pitch is inconsistent (sounds like it's largely the tenors), but the group has decent expression and the vowels are mostly internally consistent.If gifting, beware. I could not consider this good for casual listening."
3,Just OK toy,Gave this to the wife as we started exploring GSpot stimulation. It was soft and comfortable but not enough power to get the job done.
1,broke right out of the gate!,"The FIRST time I used this, when I was cleaning it, I heard and felt it crack in the middle of the toy. That was the end of it! The first time I used it and it broke! I bought it at a sex shop and paid around $90. You'd think it'd be of MUCH better quality.The woman at the toy shop raved about this line of toys, but I gotta say this has made me pretty hesitant to buy a second one. The one I purchased may have just had a defect, but I dunno.I say, buyer beware, or buyer be unreasonably gentle.:{"
2,Not so much,Although the other reviews were good on this product i dont really enjoy it. There are other things to do that feel better and are free. It may just be me but i have found other toys bought on this site to work much better. i dont think it was worth the money but it may work for you.
1,not worth it,"this vibrator claims to have various speeds, but i found it to be very weak and ineffective at producing any kind of stimulation whatsoever. it was horrible. because i wanted something a little more discreet, i bought the pocket rocket by doc johnson. while this vibrator has only one speed, it is a very powerful and effective speed, and costs less ($12.33). it is not waterproof, but if care is used to prevent water from getting in the battery capsule, then it can be washed with soap and water and still work."
5,John Tesh Creates a Timeless Collection,"John Tesh has created a timeless collection of masterpieces that evoke the spirtit and passion of love. The gorgeous repertoire is well chosen and flows seamlessly. The stirring piano performaces of Daniel Pollack, John Novacek, and Anthony & Joseph Paratore show that these world class artists were selected by Tesh for their ability to capture a romantic mood, and send the listener to new heights. I have had this album for several weeks now, and I play it every day.--J.Jones"
4,Romance,Very soothing music with definite romance in the background if you're a romantic type. Very nice to listen to when needing to get a break from the stresses of the day.
1,Good Songs - Bad Song Arrangements & Bad Recording/Mix,"The songs on the record are good, however the recordingquality is well below a typical commercial release. The recording of the drums on all of the songs with the exception of ""Low Pressure"" sounds lifeless and dead. For a Blues/R&B album to have dead lifeless sounding drums is a crime. The songs are further hampered by bad arrangements with the vocals being covered up by harmonica and guitar on many of the songs. One song in particular ""Alabama Blues"" which is such a great blues song has the impact completely dissipated by a bad arrangement/mix where other instruments cover over the vocals. Two songs on the album are good from an arrangement/recording/mix point of view - ""Somewhere Down the Line"" the title track and ""Mrs. Parkers View"".I leave it to the reader to determine if the album is worth buying based on my review."
2,"Incomplete - the song ""Edie"" is NOT on this!","The Instant Live recording being sold of this show is incomplete. It is missing the track ""Edie"". There is a very blatant edit that cuts off Ian mid-sentence after they play ""Wonderland"", and then the song ""Star"" starts. Be forewarned. The tracklist showing is wrong. There is no ""Edie"", and in it's place is ""Star"". I was at this show and both songs were performed. Somebody at Instand Live messed up and they cut (very sloppily, as well) a track from this recording.The performance itself is great, but this is a sub-par, incomplete product."
4,Works great but needed oiling,"Bought this turntable for doing bonsai and for the most part I am very very happy with it.However, when it arrived I inspected the ball bearings inside of this thing and they were rusty. It was a pretty complicated endeavor to bend the two halves of the table apart while applying oil to the 12 ball bearings inside of it. But I got it done and it works really smooth now.All-in-all this is a great little table for me and will definitely work well for you if you can be a bit patient and oil the bearings. I would think that this totally beats the one that costs over a hundred smakeroos."
3,Only exercises,"this textbook is only exercises so it must be assigned to you. The exercises are well put but the textbook is made of thin, cheap paper that rips easily."
2,Make sure you buy the other book!,"This version of the Essentials of Accounting book requires you to purchase an additional booklet with the worksheets and exhibits that are absolutely essential for using this workbook. Since this isn't stated anywhere, and the additional book can cost near $50, I gave this book a low rating. (And yes, perhaps these worksheets are included in later editions, but I'm reviewing this edition.)As for the usefulness of this book, I found it completely dull, and annoying to work with, having to cover the side of the page all the time. I bought it as a review for a graduate financial accounting class I was getting ready to take, and I tried to use it, and just couldn't, and did just fine in the class without ever using this book."
3,Decent but has errors in test answers,"Structure makes it easy to read, but as earlier comments pointed out there are multiple errors in the test. I found the first one on Part III but its not to say there weren't any in Part I or Part II."
1,You NEED the workbook to use this text.,The book asks questions based on worksheets in a workbook. You cannot use this text without the workbook. You most likely will not get the workbook with this book. Horrible.
1,NOT HAPPY,WAS NOT HAPPY WITH THE FACT THAT THIS WAS A WORKBOOK AND NO INDICATION AS TO THAT FACT. I WAS LOOKING FOR THE TEXT AND WHEN I RECEIVED THE BOOK IT WAS A WORKBOOK BUT THE DESCRIPTION SAID NOTHING TO THIS BEING A WORKBOOK
5,A terrific product!,"I have used an Oxo dish wand for several years now. The sponge is extremely durable, and the shape perfect for washing all kinds of kitchenware, not just glasses. This tool is perfect for quickly washing out bowls, pans, baking dishes - everything. Even though it looks a little funny, this beats the heck out of any other kind of sponge-tip scrubber that I have ever tried."
4,CLEAN BUT SKIMPY,I love this wand. Cleans well and gets into everything.The biggest criticism is that the reservoir doesn't hold very much detergent. Seems that we're refilling this thing about 2-3 times a week.Hasn't stopped us from using it.The replacement heads are another matter- please see my review on them....
5,DISH WAND,"EXCELLENT FOR CLEANING TALL GLASSES, WINE GOBBLETS, PILSNER GLASSES AND VIRTUALLY ANY TALL TUBULAR VESSEL UP TO A FOOT."
4,Works well,"It works, Good for glasses and long neck items. I like it but I don't reach for it everytime. I just prefer a dish rag I guess.OXO Good Grips 1050163 Soap Dispensing Dish Wand RefillsDon't forget refills!"
1,Cheap chair... not even worth $50.00 and You charged $200.00,"""Chair had several holes in arm and a broken swivel knob. i sent seller an email and did not get a response. Should have sent it back instead of hoping they'd replace the broken & torn parts. Don't Waste your $ on this."""
2,"there are better ""pop"" beads out there","Some are too tight to put together or pull apart, some are so loose they just fall apart. It's girly with butterflies and such, but most of the beads are soccer balls. The pieces are poorly molded. We've tried other pop beads that are more consistent in quality. The only brand I know of that are one of the better ones are the Klutz pop beads that come with a book. You don't get as many in those sets though.Bought these used for a dollar or two; they're good enough to occupy a few moments. Glad I didn't pay anything close to retail price for them."
2,This band found God and wants to tell.,"I bought this cd expecting a compilationof various bands .It's really just one band . Where they came up with ska 98 is beyond me, their music is more power pop like than ska although it has some ska like stuff hidden in it . Every song is aboutGod. Have these guys met the Supertones? Well it's not all horrible, I found song #4listed on the jacket as song #3 has its moments. It might be religious but it's not bad. Final stone isn't too bad either.This cd won't part the Red Sea but it doesn't suck either .If you're looking for ska look somewhere else . If you want power pop shades of CIV but not quite as good and you don't mind the religion then buy this cd ."
1,terrible!,this is the worst cd i have ever heard......ska is so stpuid and trendy now it makes me sick for all of you who i read this you are pitiful for liking ska! stupid trendy idiot.
1,Good recording,I heard a live performance and wanted this in my collection to be able to hear it again. Good recording.
2,Not right!,"I won't go into details here, this recording is just off from the beginning. Pacing is uncomfortable and this isn't a good 8!"
5,Tom Tom Go 510 Black Front Cover,Excellent replacement for the original silver cover. This cover gives the unit a betterr sleek look than the original. I puchased this cover due to breaking the original and it fits perfectly.
3,No results yet!,"Been taking it for 2 weeks now...no results yet!! I've been having cold hands and feet for a long, long time. Until recently found out that sea vegetables are good for such problems and thought of giving this product a try. Hopefully, I will be able to write a more commendable review in about 2 weeks. Good luck for all those who plan to try this product."
3,Lot of research,"I'm sure there was a lot of research involved in writing this book.The subject wasn't interesting to me, but I'm sure would be , or it is to others.Thank you"
5,Excellent Top 40 collection from 1967,"I don't usually review compilations. Too many variables. However, this excellent collection seems to have been sold short by a previous reviewer . . . so here's my take.This playlist lives up to its name - AM Gold. If you want the B side of Vanilla Fudge 45's, or need to hear Jimi Henrix played backwards, this is not for you (are you listening, oh Gourmet of Alternative Rock?). Classic Schmassic.I highly recommend this CD for us late middle agers that grew up on AM Top 40. My advice after purchase: DO NOT even look at the song list. Just put in the CD and be ready for some very pleasant surprises. Wonderful stuff. And it sounds even better now than the ecstasy of back when I heard it the first time via the single blown out speaker in my Plymouth. I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,This is the best nut cracker I have ever used.,"It is easy, works with lots of different nuts, can be used for crab or lobsters and does not drop bits of nut shell's around when you use it."
1,Not what I expected!,"I read the customer reviews on this book, and decided to give it a try despite some negative comments. I must say, I found nothing of value in the cookbook, and returned it. I can easily create low-carb recipes that are much better than the ones offered by Dr. Atkins and his wife! I was hoping to find some recipes that used the Atkins Baking Mix, but to no avail! I have many cookbooks on my shelf that I have kept because there were a few tempting dishes. I am sorry to say that there were none in this one."
4,Great diet! but ingredients hard to find.,"I highly recommend the Atkin's Diet! I have been on it for six months now and I am losing wieght, looking and feeling better than I have for many years. You only feel tired if you don't get enough fat in the diet. It took me a while to figure this out. However, the ingredients in his recipes are very hard to find. I have access to only a small health food store. If you don't have access to a very large, well-stocked health food store, you may have to order the ingredients online. I still salute Dr. Atkins and thank him for giving me my health back!"
3,Inconsistent Recipes - Forget the dessert section,"I was very eager to start using some of the recipes in this cookbook but have found very mixed results. The three dessert recipes I've tried are a cruel hoax, especially the brownies. They were basically inedible, even for my husband who never met a food he doesn't like. He threw them away after tasting one. There are recipes which in the method section call for ingredients that aren't listed in the ingredient section. One chicken dish calls for the dish to be baked for two hours, which would make it good for only the garbage. I would hardly call the spicy cauliflower recipe spicy. However, the goat cheese chicken breast rollup has become one of our favorites. If they could just remove the dessert section altogether and editorially fix the recipes that need to be, it would make it a much better cookbook."
4,"Quick & Easy !!! But, needs more re: Less...........","The book needs recipes that have less total carbs per serving. I would like more soup recipes, like a good chicken soup recipe. This book makes it easy to lose the weight. When a plateau is difficult to move past, I wish there were some sort of ""jump start"" hints, or something suggested in the book to help at this time. I really did love the recipes I have tried so far, not only tasty but easy. Thanks"
1,Dr. Atkins: New Diet Cookbook,"I am completely grateful for all of the work and research Dr. Atkins has done over the years. His book ""New Diet Revolution"" has changed my life! I lost over 60 pounds in less than 5 months! (Thank you again Dr. Atkins.) I am not, however, as pleased with the ""New Diet Cookbook"". I am a vegetarian seeking a cookbook that promotes low-carb cooking in addition to the no-meat approach. Most of the recipes in this book require pork, beef, chicken, and other meat substances-understandably so, since the diet is a high-protein/high fat program. For those that enjoy consuming meat, this book may be of pleasure to you. But for people like me who prefer a vegetarian lifestyle, yet still require a high-protein, low carbohydrate diet, you won't find success with this book. Good luck on your weight loss/management journey. May peace and happiness be unto you."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"I am so disappointed with this cookbook; I expected something better from Dr. Atkins. The few tasty recipes were too high in carbs and the lower carb recipes just didn't taste good to me. It's obvious that Dr. Atkins and I do not share similar culinary tastes. However, there are a few really good low carbohydrate cookbooks out there now; I recommend ""Lauri's Low-Carb Cookbook"" by Lauri Randolph or ""The Low-Carb Cookbook"" by Frances McCullough. These are the best two available to date; they both offer a variety of cooking styles and tastes. I love Dr. Atkins diet plan, but I am very disappointed in his cookbook."
4,Cut Carbs for the Millenium,"As the author of the first ""insulin-conscious"" gourmet cookbook (""The Gourmet Prescription: High Flavor Recipes for Lower Carbohydrate Diets""), I'm 100% in favor of new low-carbohydrate recipes to help people on insulin-controlling diets avoid FOOD BOREDOM. From a culinary point of view, the recipes in this book are adequate, but no one would mistake them for exciting, creative, full-flavored cuisine. For that, you need THE GOURMET PRESCRIPTION, which is as much about INTENSIFYING FLAVOR as it is about LOWERING CARBOHYDRATES."
3,Not very impressed,I was expecting quick and easy recipes that were really tasty and instead found the opposite. Some ingredients were difficult to find and some recipes I made were not very appetizing. There are many other low carb cookbooks available that you will enjoy for example Eat Yourself Thin Like I Did - Lauri's Low Carb Cookbook just to name a couple.
1,Too Bizarre!!!,"I puchased 2 of the ""Dr. Atkins' Quick and Easy New Diet Cookbooks, "" one for me and one as a gift. I returned them both two days after I received them. In my opinion, the recipes are too bizarre. I only found 2 recipes in this book that I would have tried. I did, however, also purchase the gram counter book and the ""Dr. Atkins' Diet Revolution"" book and I kept both of those."
5,Great recipes,"I did try some of the recipes in this book and will continued to do so (I need to lose 20 pounds)as with all low carbohydrates diet books, the recipes can be a bit bland. You will need to be some what creative, using more herbs and spices ... all in all a good book."
2,Not Bad but.... not that great either!,"Maybe my expectations were a little too high when I ordered this book but I wasn't that impressed when I got it. I have come to the conclusion that I can not eat a high protein diet for long periods of time. I need vegetables in the worst way... the breads, while I love them aren't the problem. Sometimes you want to just eat corn and carrots. I was hoping to see insightful menus that managed to incorporate carbs and keep them relatively low enough to still stay on the diet. This is clearly not attempted. The other thing is that most of the recipes were uninspiring. I didn't want to just rush right out and do them.I did find a gem though and want to give credit where credit is due.... I loved the roasted pepper soup.... now that's good."
2,Simply put-------I didn't like it.,"This book seemed to be "" quickly"" put together compared to the NEW DIET REVOLUTION. The dishes were mediocre. I tried a few which could indeed be prepared in thirty minutes but were not simple to make nor were they enjoyable. When your dieting----come on------make it appetizing! I bought this book quickly on the basis of the last one , but I learned not to ever do that again. The information about the carbohydrates would be of help to a novice but it was repetitious to anyone who had previous knowledge about Dr. Atkins. I didn't even have the majority of the ingredients called for in my kitchen either. Nothing in this book warrants it a place on my book shelf."
3,Need more recipes with small amounts of carbohydrates,"The recipes are fairly easy to make, but I would still like to see small amounts of carbohydrates in each one. Also bacon and eggs for breakfast for the rest of my life is a bit too much! As for the liquids one is allowed to drink, it doesn't specify how much ""diet drink"" for example; just this morning I took a Diet 7-Up which indicates it has 35 grams carbohydrates in it, although it is 'diet'."
2,There are better low carb cookbooks,"There are only a few recipes that I liked in this book. I didn't like the way it relied on artificial sweeteners, plus preserved meats (like bacon). But I guess that's Atkins! There are a lot of better (and healthier) low carb cookbooks out there."
5,My husband loves the dishes I have prepared from this book,"They are truly quick and easy, without unusal ingrediants. And very tasty. I use it every week."
2,Love the diet! Don't care for the book,"I found most of the recipes a little exotic for everyday. I have only found a couple recipes I would even consider trying. As a few have said before me, this is more of a gourmet cookbook. I also found the carb content of some recipes a little higher than I would have preferred."
3,its ok,"I purchased this dvd to learn how to cut hair. Overall this guy gets the point across, but i seriously doubt he is a celebrity barber. Looking at the cuts, i feel like i can do better. The best cut throughout the entire dvd is the one on the cover. I purchased volume two, but when you read the description on volume one they seem very identical. Once you pop the dvd in the player they say what happen in volume one, i honestly dont think this is worth $50. This product is over priced."
3,Too Much Ferrari,"Nice book, and the online version of the book is available at CuoreSPORTIVO ICEO Web Site. Why pay for?"
2,A thin book with not much to say,"Wilson Learning Corp.'s book about Swedish customs and culture is a start in the right direction, but unfortunately it is only a start. There are several good points brought up which may help the non-Swede avoid making a serious fool of himself or herself at a business luncheon, but that's about all there is. It's not really a book -- just a very thin pamphlet -- and it brings up only about a dozen points total, most of which anyone going to Sweden will already know. All of its points are related to business and business people, with nothing of interest for average people, tourists, motorists, hikers, or job-seekers, and nothing for people who simply want to meet and understand Swedes as people and friends. Sorry, it's not worth buying."
1,This is not worth the money,I wouldn't buy this panflet that is what it is. I would buy a real book. It was so generic that I am suprized any one would publish it.
3,"Ajinomoto is a MSG company, what did you expect.","Here's a nice link to name almost all the things that contain MSG.[...]Who hasn't had Doritos? I forgot the commercial about some snack that having one wasn't enough, but anything that you want more and more mostly likely contain MSG. Almost all processed meat, sauces, soups, and snacks contain MSG."
2,Don't be fooled into thinking this is a traditional Japanese substitue for dashi.,I thought dashi was a soup stock made from fish flakes and kombu. The top two ingredients in this product are Salt and then Monosodium Glutimate.
2,MSG,"The soup stock is good - no question there. This is perhaps the most popular western brand you'll find. Do know that the second ingredient (the first is salt) is MSG. There's a deep belief in myself, and in traditional Japanese cooking, on using only fresh materials. Again, if you don't care this soup stock works great, if you care about additives then looking somewhere else. (rakuten)"
2,Not what I wanted,"If you are looking to make legitimate miso soup, look again. This stuff makes a decent miso soup, but its incredibly salty from the tons of MSG and not that great . I am guessing ""Hon"" means fake, because this is far from what I was looking for."
2,Terrible for commercial use,"I have owned two pair of these clippers, I won't own another one. The Andis edgers are nothing like the clippers, which, the Andis clippers are awesome by the way. I have used these edgers professionally, they are bad to bite or scrape a patron on cleaning the neck or around the ears. I use the Oster T-edgers, for professional use they are the best, but, that's just my two cents. I don't know why I gave it two stars, I guess where I owned 2 of them, I gave each one star."
4,excellent,excellent item. does the job. I line myself up about once every 2 weeks and the clippers work as they did on the first day. Had the clippers for about a year.
1,the cover came crack a littel,the andis works great but the cover came with a crack which made me a littel sad but yeah great outliner
4,Solit product.,Good product. But I bought this one for my kid and it is kind of too big to trim his hair. He is 2 year and 7 month old.
3,Decent enough Trimmer..,"I had real high hopes for this one, especially after seeing all the Rave reviews here on Amazon and various other barber websites. I've had these trimmers since last summer and I really can't find a way to put and keep them in my regular ""Line up"". I've tried the promate blades and Anivo Bladesetter, I just can't get the desired ""Sharpness"". I'm sure it's nothing to do w/ the clipper itself, which is very powerful, I believe the flaw lies in the blades. I'm not knocking these @ all, what I'm saying is that they just dont work for me. I'm actually now toying w/ the notion of selling these along w/ the promate blades, and anivo bladesetter and getting another set of Detailers. I know if I go that route I'd probably go through more detailers, but I know the andis trimmer would last a lifetime. All in all it's a decent trimmer just not as ""Clean, sharp cutting"" as I would like it to be.."
5,"Another Fine ""Doodle Bear"" Product","We have added ""Doodle Monster D-Zine"" to our son's collection of ""Doodle Bear"" stuffed toys made by Play Along. All these toys can be drawn on with the accompanying two markers, but unlike permanent markers, the ink can be washed off with soapy water. Our son is addicted to these toys. More accurately, our son has AGA (Anthropomorphic Graffiti Addiction) and needs these toys to keep him from drawing on me, his mother, or any other person who happens to be prone and unconsciousness.We first bought our son the ""Doodle Monster Sketch"" model and I gave a glowing review for that product (Nov. 4, 2005). Play Along has produced several different models of the Doodle Bear Toys and also sells a ""Doodle Bear Marker Accessory 5-Pack"". My wife and I are thankful for the great variety of Doodle Bears, and as long as Play Along keeps producing them our son has an acceptable outlet for his AGA."
4,An excellent read,"I found Computer Storage: a Manager's Guide to be a really useful book, that fills a niche in the business computing book market."
2,Small,"I put a dozen decoys in this and its almost full. I could maybe get 4-5 more in there. But the drawstring on the top doesn't close very well, so adding anymore would likely result in them falling out."
4,Fantastic trumpet player.,This is a fantastic technical trumpet playing record. Any professional musician or amateur trumpet player could certainly appreciate this record.
2,Not worth it,"If you're looking some general, 101-type articles on choosing various types of electronics it does have some value. But if you're looking for specific comparison/analysis data on specific products, that is only included for a limited selection of products."
5,A LOOK INSIDE A MAN'S HEART AND LIFE,"I've heard about this young man's story for quite some time, and have been watching for the book. It's about time it's on the market. Your life won't be the same as you begin this read, and your lifestyle could change when you're done. Be prepared, if that's possible, to look ""gut truth"" in the eye when you read it. Ladies, keep the kleenex close by. Truly this book is an INSIRATION!! Fasten your seat belts."
4,Philosophy is Everywhere,"I read a very critical response here about how the book simplifies the complexity of philosophy by somehow reconciling age-old questions.Actually, I recently conducted a formal review of the same book so I had to respond. I agree that the book does not explore philosophical claims or any philosophers with great depth- nor should it! The purpose was to revive philosophy as a relevant medium to address real world problems even in businesses. To ponder over the debates of philosophy in front of a general audience only distances and distracts them further.The message I gained from the book is that using the general points of philosophy, with its timeless concepts, can create thoughtful leaders and better businesses. So, they can now form confidently defined purposes and missions. For that reason alone, philosophy earns its place among other solutions for performance. This book helps to advance this idea in a refreshing way."
3,Ghost Cat ... okay,"While the movie is alright, I was expecting the plot to be more closely related to the original book written by Beverly Butler of Wisconsin. Her vivid characters and frightening plot make the reader never want to put the book down. While the movie was done right for TV, it would have been a #1 hit in theatres if it had followed the book."
5,Great family movie!,"Saw this movie a few years ago on Animal Planet and have been looking for it on DVD since then. Thanks, Amazon. The vendor said ""like new"" and it is. Glad to find it!"
5,Heartbreaking,"Couldn't help but feel the pain that the heroine went through. Wonderful film. I was surprised by Gillian Anderson's suberb acting because I had only seen her in the television show ""X-Files"". I would recommend this film to anyone who is patient to watch this film and who has an appreciating for tragic stories."
3,Not very well edited.,"Many of the characters from the novel were left out of this film. Although the lead actress was good, if I had'nt read the novel I would have been lost."
5,Completely Absorbing,"I went into House of Mirth with considerable expectations - both the novel and Gillian Anderson are high on my list of favorites. I had put off viewing the DVD out of fear that it would disappoint, but there was no need - it was wonderful.Gillian Anderson has the ability to pull the viewer completely into her world - whatever it may be. Her subtlety is perfect for the role of Lily Bart - propelling this film into my personal top ten list. Without giving too much away, Anderson's Bart is a beautiful study of grace and dignity under pressure. The tone and style of the film is as close as possible to that of the novel - very well done."
5,Gillian Anderson does it again!,"While ""House of Mirth"" is not a film for everyone, it is for those who enjoy a wonderfully written and acted artsy film. Gillian Anderson does a superb job portraying social elite Lily Bart, from wonderful beginning to tragic end. Well worth taking the time to buy or rent this video!!"
1,It stinks!,"Ah, if only the aunt had died early in the movie, left the inheritance to Lily within the first 15 minutes, and thus spared us the whole tedious show! I have read and enjoyed the book upon which this movie is based. But, I must say, Lily is stilted and noticably ""acted"" as is the Lawrence character. The editing leaves much to be desired especially the long drawn out water and song number in the middle just prior to the yacht scenes. The only decent acting was done by Elizabeth McGovern and Dan Aykroyd. I would only recommend this movie for forced viewing in America's penal institutions. Prisoners with particularly ugly crime records would be made to see it twice."
1,No Mirth here.,"This movie definitely needed a laugh or two; it was deathly dull. Gillian Anderson's dialogue sounded as if she was reading from a book, and the rest of the characters weren't much better. We didn't particularly care what happened at the end; we just wanted the tedious affair to expire. These period piece usually don't move very fast anyway, but this one made glaciers look like tornadoes in comparison. The DVD picture quality was uneven; some shots were spectacular, while others (expecially those with Ms. Anderson) looked like they were shot through some sort of filter. I know this film was well received by most critics. I guess we just missed the point."
1,Worthless,"This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. The story line is almost incomprehensible and the story itself is bad beyond belief. In my opinion the acting was poor as well. House of Mirth plods along at the pace of a death march, the dialog makes no sense and the characters are cardboard. None of the people in the movie even seem like people. The are so stiff and unlifelike that zombies would come off well by comparsion.The story itself is simply stupid. No one would follow the actions taken by the main character unless they were insane. And I think the produce may have been insane to even think about bringing this to the screen in this fashion.Avoid this lifeless, meandering, and boring movie. It was a total waste of effort to even sit through it. All good movies start with good writing. This one fails there and then goes on to fail in every other aspect of movie making. In a word - worthless."
1,"This Movie Is Why ""0 Stars"" Should Be an Option",My wife and I agree that this is one of the worst movies we have ever seen - a complete waste of 2.5 hours!
2,pretty boring,"I love Gillian Anderson, I love her in the x-files and in playing by heart and she did well in this movie, but even with her great acting skills, this movie was boring."
2,Hated it!,"I was absolutely thrilled to learn that a movie was made of this classic- it is one of my favorite Wharton novels. When I read it, it brought me to tears. This DVD also brought me to tears, but for all the wrong reasons! One doesn't relate to Gillian Anderson as the lead- did she read the book? I picked up on a lot of self-pity and suffering but the story wasn't coherent or fluid. Maybe it came out too long for a movie and the plot was lost on the cutting room floor? Because Gillian is wooden, I feel as if everyone else seems awkward and out of place. Maybe it is true, what they say, that the book is always better than the movie? I highly recommend the book."
2,Good acting with terrible dialogue,"The acting in this beautifully shot movie was quite good, but unfortunately the script was terrible. Anderson, forced to roll out the majority of the ridiculously florid dialogue, occasionally struggled with it, but her emoting itself was good. Aykroyd and LaPaglia did a superb job acting and seemed to have no problems getting around the lines, but I must emphasize that the lines themselves were painful at times. Nobody speaks like that! And nobody ever did! The style fluctuated far too often between poetics and colloquialisms, many of the latter seeming entirely too modern for 1905.Personally, even though I am a huge LaPaglia fan, I don't know if I could stomach this movie again, wonderful though he is. I'm glad I merely rented it."
1,One of the worst ever,"Talk about a downer movie. We have compared bad movies to ""The Dead"" for a lot of years. I think we now have a new lower standard. The dialogue is horrendous. The movie moves at worse than a snails pace. The characters are totally unlikable. No redeeming qualities except to know how shallow of lives the rich lived."
1,Disappointing--read the novel instead,"Gillian Anderson's acting is stilted, and the lavish sets and costumes hardly make up for the slow, plodding, spell-everything-out-for-you-and-hit-you-over-the-head-with-it pace of the plot. She seems in awe with herself, which is entirely unbecoming. Her entire manner reeks of, ""Look at me!"" It comes across as very self-conscious and narcissistic, which detracts from the story itself. The focus is more on Anderson in a costume than it is on Wharton's novel. She's trying too hard, and the role obviously does not come naturally to her. Her attitude is grim rather than dignified. Give it a miss, and read the novel instead."
5,Excellent Social Commentary,This was an excellent movie from start to finish. The story and the dialogue were constantly engaging. Some of the language is not widely used today but was perfect for the time and the actors were good at conveying the meaning through their expressions and tone. At the beginning of the film the main character is not very likeable and seemed to be strickly worried about society and her place in it but as the film goes on we find that she is trusting because she is trustworthy to her friends and true love. When she can clear her name she sacrifices for her true love. Even though this is a period film I found myself sympathetic to Lily's situation. Wonderful performances by all. The costumes and makeup were so good I did not recognize several actors at first. I did not care for the ending but it fit the story and any other ending would have felt contrived. I came here to buy a copy because this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.
1,The House of Mirth,This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. I fell asleep several time watching it. Gillian Anderson's character couldn't have been a dumber cry baby if she tried. It also had a very predictable ending. Don't waste your money on this one!
5,my review,"This movie is a interesting Victorian movie that is also deep and intense. The acting is very good and the Clothes, the hairstyles and the back drops to the scenes was superbly done."
3,If only more passion had been put into the effort...,"The book was wonderful to read, but the movie lacks something. The actress playing Lily failed to portray Lily as a passionate, willful young lady stilted by the rigid rules of early New York society. This eventually kills her. Lily's performance was wooden and completely lacking in personality.Too bad, because this is a great story, based upon Edith Wharton's (the author) own observations of her society, and its destructiveness to those who did not play by its rules."
2,no laughing matter,"I did not like this movie. I tried but I found it devoid of feeling. One does feel for Lily, she is a tragic figure. She does not represent a person, but an ideal - an uncompromising figure sacrificed by lesser souls.Eric Stolz is a disappointment as her ""lover"". Indeed, no chemistry evolved between him and Gillian Anderson, whom I personally found stunning. He is, as another review says, too immature for the role, he has the voice of a teenager, is glib, heartless and insincere.The film is somehow gut wrenching, but not in a cathartic way. You do not feel good when it is over, or cleansed, just empty. And sad, very sad because it was all so meaningless."
3,nice sets,"I have liked the Wharton I've read, but I don't know this book. However, I rather doubt that this is a successful translation to the screen. Instead of feeling sorry for the Lily Bart character I was actually relieved when she got flushed -- she is just so painfully stupid and manages to be destructive to herself and several other people.Also, instead of ""a captured dryad"", Ms. Anderson looks worried and very short, so I have to think that this was a casting mistake. Unlike the movie ""The Age of Innocence"", when you could feel sorry for the main characters because they were trapped in a society that distorted their lives, I ended up feeling that all of her ""friends"" were better off without Lily Bart...I gave it 3 stars because it looks so good, and because I thought that the director was successful in doing what he wanted, although I suspect that he didn't do justice to the book."
4,"Worthy viewing, sharp look at class culture of the period","While you may find the story bleak going at times, the authentic period details and stunning homes of the time will keep your attention during the slower portions of this film. Gillian Anderson is surprisingly good in her role as Lily, a woman who is both naively unaware of the conventions and manners of the day as well as admirably independent in her own way. Unfortunately, Lily makes some mistakes which ""compromise"" her and set her course for life, a course that spirals steadily downward. What makes this movie particulary moving, to my mind, was watching Lily fall from a possible place in the upper classes, a place she was never sure she wanted in the first place. By the end of the movie, it is clear that she regrets her choice. A convincing portrait of a particular woman in a particular time, well-acted by Gillian Anderson. Strong supporting roles by Dan Ackroyd, Laura Linney, Eric Stoltz."
2,A Poor Imitation of the Book,"After reading the book, I was looking forward to a fine adaptation. What I got was a miscast Lily Bart, poor screenplay and actors saying their lines like school players. A great disappointment. If you are going to do Edith Wharton, you need to let her great words come through. They don't come anywhere near in this film."
3,Uneven performance,"The biggest flaw to this movie is the uneven performance put up by Anderson. She is great in the first half an hour, but her performance degenerates into pity (much like the character she plays) and unconvincing for the rest of the film. Aykroyd just looks and acts ridiculous as the married seducer, probably the worst cast role in the film. For some reason I never developed a full sympathy for Lily Bart. It could have been a great film, but the rather theatrical direction leave the film cold."
2,It's like watching a train wreck,"Ee gads! Painful, tragic and long. I kept hoping it would surprise me and turn around, but it did not. What started out as an interesting period piece turned slow and torturious. Except for the excellent, and exceptional, performance by Gillian Anderson, this movie would have only gotten one star from me."
1,awful casting,"This a favorite book of mine--I've read it twice--and I eagerly awaited the film version. What a disappointment.Biggest problem for me was poor casting, starting with the lead role. Gillian Anderson proves here why she's only been successful on a sci-fi television show. Dan Ackroyd and Anthony LaPaglia are both good actors, but both seemed out of place here. Only Laura Linney shined; the film would have been far better if she had played Lillie Bart. (And speaking of out of place, using old, ivy covered Scottish houses for old New York brownstones looked ridiculous.)Save your money and read, or re-read, Wharton's novel."
3,Flawed but beautiful,"There are several problems with this film. I think the main problem is that most of the actors look very uncomfortable. Their performances, with few exceptions, are stilted. The second problem is that Lily Bart, as the heroine, is not someone you are cheering for. She is not a fighter or a winner, she is a victim. Worse yet, she is a victim of the stupid choices she makes over and over again. She surrounds herself with people who are lecherous, two-faced, greedy, envious, etc., and then wonders why they betray and abandon her. And, of course, there is also an unhappy ending.The costumes and sets are breathtaking. Every once in a while I like to watch this movie despite its flaws. Maybe it's because the film just looks so beautiful."
2,Aliens trying to act human.,"I loved Edith Wharton's THE HOUSE OF MIRTH, I know the novel well, and was really disappointed in this movie.It wasn't so true to the book--which I understand is often the case in novel adaptations--but there were some fundamental differences in the character's behaviors.Furthermore, the casting and the acting was terrible. It was like watching either a couple of aliens trying to act human, or horrific over-acting as if it were the opening of a porno movie.I like Gillian Anderson very much in the X-Files, and I've liked her in other things. This role, she was not right for--not at all. And she didn't have any of the calm, cool natural that Lily Bart did.Disappointment :-("
5,A TERRIFIC HOLST DISC,"Ever since Zubin Mehta and the LA Phil took us on that ""Ultimate Trip"" back in the glory days of vinyl, I've been an avid collector of Holst's ""The Planets"". While no other version has ever totally displaced that cherished 1970s London FFRR Recording, which remains a TAS record of distinction, several have been outstanding. This CD by Andrew Davis is a true contender. It is exceptional on all grounds: sonics, interpretation, and boasting a great addition in the orchestral piece ""Egdon Heath"". That filler is INSTANTLY recognized as a work by Holst. The leadership of sometimes maligned conductor Andrew Davis is inspired, and his musicians are clearly enjoying the monment. So will you. An outstanding release in every way."
5,Excellent Product,"This is my favorite coconut milk. I used to buy it at my local safeway, but they have been out of it for weeks. My order was received in a timely matter."
5,Really gets you thinking.,"THE GOOD: The variety is what makes this fun. They really get you thinking on how to solve them. Thankfully a ""solutions"" answer sheet is included.THE BAD: If I could change anything I would have made them bigger. And maybe made them more kid friendly (Like the one with smiley faces)OVERALL: a good purchase, would the other set."
3,brain boggler,This product was bought to be used by elderly patients in a nursing facility as a recreational therapy tool. I'm not sure how effective it has been. It was a donation given by me for them.
3,"Well manufactured, too easy","The puzzles are made really well, nicely manufactured and durable. However, the difficulty is way too low, therefore this was not too much fun."
5,Fun for everyone!,We all sat around Christmas morning trying to solve these. My six year old solved one before anyone else! A great stocking stuffer.
2,Waste,The pieces are so tiny! They are basically raw metal pieces. My 8 year old son wanted some of these brian bogglers but he was not interested in these due to the size.
2,decent diuretic,"This did not work for me. After trying it for several weeks, all it did was have me running to pee... frequently... and breaking out in cold sweats. I may have lost a pound or two, which I gained back after retiring the product. It was most likely water weight. On the up side, it may have some beneficial ingredients, and it did not make me sick (as some diet pills have.)"
2,Money for nothing so get your tea for free,This is maybe something that works for some but I could not tell I was even taking the product. I could get more energy and fat burning capabilities from a good cup of joe. I took several bottles before I gave it up and decided I was better off keeping my money.
2,Not strong enough for heartburn,"Purchased this for heartburn, but it was not as strong as I had hoped and was ineffective. Will have to look for stronger stuff..."
1,Costly,I purchased this item at swansonvitamins.com for $2.49.It seemed to work ok but i didnt like the idea of taking it all the time
5,best price / best product,After many reviews and much research I found that Swanson is the best bang for the buck and Amazon's pricing is incredible. Cant beat it anywhere.
5,Understanding and using the Sugar Busters concept better!,"Since reading this book I've had solid sucess in weight loss and am eating healtheir and feeling better. The book Sugar Busters for Kids did accomplish several key elements in my personal weight loss program.This book helped me greatly to understand the ""why"" of my life long struggle with weight and obesity. It has given me a tool in the understanding of ""how"" certain foods affect my wieght loss. And it has provided me with the ""what"" to eat and feel good at the same time.The Glycemic Index Tables provided an easy and useful referance to the everyday control of my diet and food intake. Dr. Andrews and team have made the concept easier to understand and workable.The recipes work, and I love the use of Creole seasoning to put flavor into some of the dishes.My daughter who is a sophmore in college also uses the info found in this book very helpful.This book should be included in every dieters libray, know matter what the age."
5,A Visionary Look at Pure Wisdom,"Bravo! William Shatner for shattering the myth that everyone over 50 is teetering on the edge of uselessness and senility. Contrary to the popular belief put forward in the philosophy of Bart Simpson and every child's breakfast cereal commercial put out in the last ten years, Grown-ups have more that a clue. Thank you for your visionary look at the pure wisdom that comes with having lived long enough to know a few things. ""Has Been"" reveals that true artistry comes from the hand of a master and mastery is not handed out with birth certificates. It is the product of years, experience, and tireless work at polishing the gem of one's chosen craft. Loved Gonzo Ballet too. Put it out on DVD."
5,21st Century Transformed Man,"Out of the CDs that have come out in the past 10 years, this one keeps being played more than most of them.When it comes to actors trying their hand at recording music, most fail miserably. This was put together by Ben Folds and has a stellar list of musicians and collaborators from across the board, and can be considered a ""concept album"" because they co-wrote most of the songs.It is mostly lighthearted but when he goes into the piece about how his wife died,a lot of this is some of the most self-depreciating and personal material you'll ever hear.Highly recommended."
4,Those who appreciate William Shatner and Ben Folds will totally dig this CD.,"I expect things from Ben Folds & William Shatner to be bent in some way...so this didn't let me down. The high point of the album of course is the cover of the tune ""Common People"" with Joe Jackson adding vocal help. That's Me Trying (featuring Aimee Mann and Ben Folds) is another surprise tune that I found quite appealing. The other tunes on the CD are good too but these two along with ""Real"" and ""Has Been"" are the primary tunes I keep coming back to to hear in my MP3 player."
1,awful awful awful awful,"A friend of mine lent this to me saying there were some insightful songs on it. There aren't. It's a guy who can't/won't sing being self-indulgent.""he says Phoenix, Pegasus, Grecian urn, midwest turn, so much to learn""and so on. If it wasn't Shatner it wouldn't have got past the front desk..."
3,P-P-P-lease Bill,"Perhaps a hundred years from now nobody will have heard of an ancient TV series called ""STAR TREK"". However, there will be a huge cult following over a TV character called ""T.J. HOOKER"". All I want to know is...when will Bill Shatner do a version of ""Please Mr. Custer, I don't want to go..."". In its place, perhaps a CD version of his immortal take on ""Rocketman""."
5,Completely unexpected,"When a friend told be about this album I shrugged it off with a ""yeah right"". Boy was I wrong. By turns rocking, hilarious and deeply insightful, it never loses its pace or feel. Musically it is punchy and sometimes challenging. And if nothing else, you can add the cover of Common People to your iTunes party playlist."
4,a solid effort from a mature performer,"I bought this CD after hearing the title cut. I expect a ""novelty"" CD I would play a few times for friends, for a few laughs.Instead, I got a strong album from a mature entertainer.The lyrics, mostly written by Shatner himself, are filled with ironic and sometimes biting humor. Most of the cuts are collaborations, featuring some amazing performances from veteran vocalists and musicians, including Joe Jackson, John Mark Painter, and Aimee Mann.I found the middle of the CD a little weak, but there's enough great material to earn this CD a regular spot on my playlist.Approach ""Has Been"" with an open mind - it's worth the effort."
5,The most original album I have ever heard...,"Whatever Shatner does, he does it best in this album. It's a brilliant mix of social commentary, humor, reflection and thoughts to where we're going. This should not be a stand alone album, it really needs a companion piece."
5,One of 2004's Best!,"Here's a real surprise package: William Shatner meets Ben Folds and the results are musically varied and tremendously entertaining, from the instant classic opener ""Common People"" through the moving ""What Have You Done"" to the playful title track. Sample; buy; recommend to friends!"
4,"Amazing - and no, I'm not high, or a Trekkie.","This is unlike anything you've heard before. Spoken-word by Shatner, but with musical accompaniments from some popular music greats like Aimee Mann, Ben Folds, and Henry Rollins.It's not background music, and it may take a little getting used to, but his rhythym and pacing is addictive, and the undeniable influence of Ben Folds as producer keeps the music catchy and well within the realm of smart pop."
5,This is BRILLIANT.,"I heard this slammed on the Howard Stern Radio Show and I liked what I'd heard and downloaded it from the iTunes Music Store -- this CD is **BRILLIANT**!!! The music is excellent, it's very well produced, and William Shatner's lyrics and vocals are concise and genuinely touching. This is a flat-out BRILLIANT album and you ought to hear it, you will not be disappointed.This is GENIUS, nothing less. Brilliant, great stuff. Highly recommended!!!"
4,Stunning!,"I heard about this album while listening to the Howard Stern Show when Bill Shatner and Ben Folds called in to annouce it. At first the idea seemed as if it was being played for laughs, but when you listen to the songs, they are heartfelt, honest and sincere. ""Common People"" is a flat out rock tune, ""That's Me Trying"" is a sad look at a father trying to reconnect with a long lost daughter he walked out on years ago. There are some great guest musicians on here like Aimee Mann and the tracks have that definete Ben Folds sound to them-which is great. I never thought that one of my favorite albums of the year would be by William Shatner, but here it is-and it's fabulous."
4,Shatner comes down to earth,"OK so you may have heard the Transformed Man and other campy work from Mr. Shatner but this is a whole different sound. This album manages to swing styles from pop-rock to country and then ballads to rants and all of it is fantastic. When a friend raved about it I was exceptionally sceptical but I am now a believer - it's great.Stand out tracks are 'That's Me Trying', 'Real' and 'It Hasn't Happened Yet'. It's hard to listen to 'What Have You Done' given how personal the song is. I could have done w/o the overly long 'Together' or maybe it's just a little too long. Overall this is a solid and varied work that I guarantee will pleasantly surprise you."
3,You must be a devoted Bill Shatner fan ...,"Bill sort of talks, sort of sings his poems. I can't imagine anyone but a devoted Bill Shatner fan liking this. I'm a poet, but nothing sticks in my mind about this but the sound of his voice. Sorry Bill, love you, but stick to acting."
4,Entertaining,"Humorous and the songs (if you can call them that) are very well done. ""I Can't Get Behind That"", ""Familiar Love"" and ""Real"" are my favorites. ""It Hasn't Happened Yet"" and ""Common People"" are also very good."
4,surprising,"It's a very fun and a little emotional. Common people is one of my favorite songs. The is a poem on the album about Bill finding his wife... it could bring you to tears, other than that it is very fun!"
4,Comic genius!,"The man is a comic genius! Actually, besides being quite funny,there is some nice music on here too. There ARE a couple songsthat I could do without but everything else is very good.Obviously, I can't get behind Bill's ""singing"" but hestill does do a nice job of delivering some very crafty & unique lyrics.Also, there's a good Shatner/Henry Rollins duet on here. Very touching! ;P"
5,You'll be happy you bought it.,"This album, in addition to being extraordinarily surprising, contains, what I feel, is a life-changingly good song: ""Common People"". Now, the rest of the cd is generally good (with some exceptions), but I am telling you, it is worth the price for COMMON PEOPLE. Brilliant.""That's Me Trying"", ""You'll Have Time"", and ""Has Been"" are also good songs. But ""Common People"" is garuanteed to become one of you all-time favorites."
5,Make Time to listen to this!,"As I listened each song is very unique and great! My favorite song is 'I Can't Get Behind That' and 'Ideal Woman.' The arangements and music are great and uplifting. The words and music work so well together, Ben Folds does an outstanding job. Listen to this when you need to smile and laugh. Will be waiting for the next volume! Has Been Might Again!"
5,inspired recording,"This is as far away from my usual preferences as you can get. A friend lent me this CD and it hit me square in the jaw. Pure briliance even if completely unexpected. From the POP brilliance of COMMON PEOPLE to the bitter sweet and truely sensational THATS ME TRYING, this will grip you and keep you enthralled till the final track. Whatever your musical preferences, buy this. It is a unique and exceptional CD that should be in any CD collection. I better stop as I am running out of superlatives that I can hurl at this magnificient ( well one more ) CD."
2,Is this a joke?,"Okay, let me say that I am a huge fan of William Shatner and Star Trek. I was pretty suprised when I found out he was coming out with an album, and I was quite anxious to hear it. Unfortunately I think if Mr. Shatner wants to get serious into the music scene needs to learn how to either PLAY AN INSTRUMENT OR SING. He doesn't even sing on the album at all! He just reads poetry while other people play and sing around him. There were parts that I liked, but a lot of the album I can't bear to listen to, I just can't take it seriously. It feels insincere to me. What is he doing? I would download this, but sorry Bill, I don't think I could spend my money on it."
5,"Listened expecting a good laugh - instead, it's GOOD!","Honestly. You may not want to believe it, but it's good. Shatner doesn't sing - he speaks, like Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady - but it doesn't have the exaggerated, smarmy quality you might expect. On some tracks, like track 3, he's rather funny, but on others, his speaking voice is truly evocative and moving. This is no gag album - the songs are very good, especially Common People.It's good - really, really good. Who knew?"
4,Has Been Might Again,"I bought the CD shortly after hearing the entire stream of the album. I just had to have it. It made me smile, brought a tear or two to my eye and even made me laugh. My 15 year old daughter finds it infinitely listenable and has played it more times over the past couple of days than me...The songs are memorable... every last one of them. The whole character of the CD is such that you want to sing along.This is destined to be a classic and I wouldn't be surprised if the CD goes platinum and ends up with a Grammy nomination... if I could just figure out which category to assign it as the songs range from gospel to spegetti western to pop. Shatner is just a category unto himself. Just unique."
5,More than I could have ever imagined.,"I had heard Common People. I saw all of the 5 star reviews here. How could this many people be wrong, I thought. So I bought it. Well, they weren't. Every good thing you read is true. For those who think they might be turned off by his speaking rather than singing, just listen to what he's saying and you'll realize it just wouldn't work any other way. It's honest, self-deprecating, humorous, touching and musical. You can't ask for more than that."
5,Best thing he's ever done,"Don't get out off by prior Shatner stuff. This is grammy material. I mean its just absurd how good it is. ""Common People"" is my favorite. Absolutley amazing. Watch him be all over the MTV awards, and win. Man the world just gets wierder and wierder."
3,is the place setting a match,"I already had 10 place settings and purchased two more. When I received them, it looked like the knives had a brushed matte finish whereas the other 4 pieces had a shiny finish. These knives did not look like the other 10 that I already had. I wrote Amazon about this problem 2 times, to see if they'd sent the wrong things or if there was a problem with the item. I never got a response."
4,"Excellent heavy metal, but not 'annoying' heavy.","Shihad are the best heavy metal/hard rock band in New Zealand. This is perhaps their best known single. A good tune, great guitar work, and excellent vocals from the lead. Work a look... check out their album too."
2,A little disappointed...,"I had gotten one of these several years ago and it worked fantasic. This one ripped within a month of use. I don't know if I just got a bad one or it's now being made cheaper, but I am looking for something else.When it works, it works great, but when it doesn't..."
5,INFORMATIVE and THOUGHT-PROVOKING,"How ironic that the ""unfeeling media beasts"" of the 1990's have been around and doing the damage that they have for decades. Poor Lindbergh was ill-equipped to handle the public adoration and subsequent loathing; this book is an indictment on American society which is quick to ""build up a hero"" and even quicker to tear that hero limb from limb. Berg's account is level and well-researched. It has been enlightening reading."
3,Too many typos!,Why did it have to start with a number of typos? Annoying! It makes you distrust the quality right in the beginning and your mind keeps looking for more mistakes. The book is a bit of a rehash.
3,Expectations not really fulfilled,"Having written a good deal on Anne Morrow Lindbergh's life and writing, I enjoyed it as vacation reading matter but found little new material in Scott Berg's biography of Charles Lindbergh. Knowing that access to family papers was unlimited, I expected a great deal more than previous biographers of one or both Lindberghs had uncovered. Much more interesting to me were interviews I had with their daughter Anne before her death and the book Reeve, the younger daughter, has written about her parents. Both Lindberghs continue to fascinate, but the real story lies, I am confident, in a thorough treatment of Anne Morrow Lindbergh's writings, both published and private. Dr Ramona S. Fletcher"
4,An In-Depth Study,"A. Scott Berg's biography of Charles Lindbergh is jam-packed with curious and interesting details, many reported for the first time. Although this is not a short book, there are no wasted pages. Berg dove headfirst into the sea of Lindbergh's life and came up with pearls in his fists. Berg has an eye for the dramatic, but he is also a top-drawer researcher. I had the impression of a historical scholar hard at work as I read his book.Berg's Lindbergh is a must-read for all those interested in the aviator's life, but I give him four stars because I thought other biograpers (Brendan Gill, et al.) did a better job of capturing Lindbergh's spirit.Richard Salva--author of Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]"
4,Book is not bad...,"...however A. Scott Berg is an arrogant ****. Lingbergh wasn't worthy of his fame not to mention having a book written about him. ""A company that might match him in the world of aviation""?"
2,Author enamored of subject and loses objectivity.,"Just like he did with his Max Perkins book, Berg has once again become enamored with his subject and loses his objectivity. Berg dances around Lindbergh's outrageous anti-Semitism and love for Hitler by claiming that his private writings don't support the fact that he despised Jews. Berg never stops to think that Lindbergh edited his own private writings, knowing that it would someday be read by a biographer.Berg has shown this naivete before in his book on Max Perkins where he tries to portray notorious anti-Semite Thomas Wolfe as a cuddly character."
2,"Disappointing, family approved biography","The story of Lindbergh's unusual (strange) childhood and his courageous flight across the Atlantic were gripping. But overall Berg's biography of Lindbergh is a big BORE. So much nitty gritty detail....with no substance. Berg never gets to the heart of this man. In fact, Berg's portrayal of Lindbergh makes me wonder whether Lindbergh HAD a heart. He seemed oblivious to the horrors of Nazism and he appeared indifferent to his family. (So indifferent in fact that I now wonder whether Lindbergh could have been behind his son's disappearance and murder.)"
2,Would have been twice as good at half its length,"Berg's book is slow going because of the writer's tedious, ponderous style. Some judicious editing would have made it a lot better read. He takes pages to say what could be written in a paragraph. The subject is interesting but the writer doesn't offer any real new insight into the enigmatic man."
3,Was Lindbergh a hero?,"For a well researched look at the dark side of Charles Lindbergh, read ""Crime of the Century: The Lindbergh Kidnapping Hoax"" by Gregory Ahlgren and Stephen R. Monier. The conclusions presented in that book will blow your mind."
4,The Whole Story,Mr.A. Scott Berg had the class to write a true biography of an american icon. The truth will hurt those reader's who want to further indoctrinate their mind with information regarding Lindbergh's so called Nazi connection or other conspiracy theory...it's a biography of not an ordinary man...but of a visionary.
5,This book gives the reader a complete look into his life.,"Scott Berg's book brings together a large amount of American history and tells a very intresting and fascinating story about one of American's beloved heroes. In his book he brings to the attention of the reader the side of Lindbergh 's life that was not told to the public but is one that is very intresting to the follower of history. In closing, this book has now set the standard for generations to come to know and to understand Charles Lindbergh."
2,The audio version certainly was a disappointment.,"Maybe the book version is better. But I was looking forinformation on his infatuation with Hitler and the Luftwaffe. Nothing!The audio version does talk about the ""America First"" movement & his ""alleged"" anti-semitism but skipping entirely the many trips he made to pre-war Germany is really inexcusable. Either this is a really bad editing job or a whitewash of an important part of his life."
1,Nine years for what?,"I think a little skepticism is in order with biographies authorized by a deceased subject's family -- especially a subject as controversial as Charles Lindbergh. Subsequently, I didn't figure to find an objective analysis of Lindbergh's life and nor did I find one. Even more disturbing was Berg's apologetic tone in explaining Lindbergh's outright antisemitism and less than passing interest in eugenics. Why make sorry excuses for a dead man? America doesn't need another Colombus; we don't need another contrived American hero. Oops! I almost forgot: it doesn't pay to spend 9 years writing a family-authorized biography which would upset the way America looks at itself."
3,Too Simple for a Complex Man,"Raise your hands - how many people see Jimmy Stewart when you hear the name Lindbergh?Yet, we'd have a hard time seeing Jimmy embracing Hitler, which Lucky Lindy did. There's a brand now book out now exploring an ""alternate universe"" scenario where Lindbergh is president. One hypothetical outcome of President Linbergh is pogroms in the United States. Makes McCartyism seem like getting off easy...This book dwells on the heroic aspects of Lindy without dishing up the forces which would draw this ""simple country boy"" into a belief that fascism would save the world. It cannot be just the ""law and order"" mentality delivered by the horrendous kidnapping of his baby, which seems to be suggested here.Nonetheless, read this book before you read the new one on ""President Lindberg."" Real history is sometimes more challenging but more fun that the fictional stuff, and this book is straight facts."
1,hagiography and non-history,"There should be a zero or minus star category. Read the book a few years ago, only to find after the most superficial googling and fact-checking, the author omitted or did not find out about Lindbergh's multiple illegitimate children by two German women. Besides soft pedalling his notorious racism and anti-Semitism, how can this be considered a biography when such basic information is left out? Is there going to be a corrected edition?"
5,Great Deal!,"I was excited to get all my goodies in one box, and this delivery didn't disappoint. I bought the first Olympus shock proof/waterproof camera that came available in early '07 and paid $350 for it. After some rough and tumble in the surf one of the screws went missing on the front of the camera and a bit of water entered the memory card housing. The camera still functions, but its underwater ability is compromised so I went looking to replace it. I found this deal that includes tonnes of great extras (individually valued, this package would probably be worth $450), and I'm happy. Olympus makes the only camera really up to taking the beating that water or snow sports can throw at it, and the novelty of the images make for great fun."
5,CURIOSITY MUSIC,I LOVE CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT. THEIR MUSIC IS FANTASTIC AND I HOPE THEY WILL SOON RECORD ANOTHER ALBUM.I ESPECIALLY LIKE DOWN TO EARTH AND FREE. PLEASE DON'T LET THE WORLD LIVE WITHOUT YOUR MUSIC.
3,Good Brit group with Duran Duran sound!,"Curiosity killed the cat, The very best is a good album with lots of Duran Duran sound to the music. ""Misfit"" which is there biggest hit that went to #1 in the UK!"
5,The book cover,I was facinated by the artwork of the book cover. What indepth detail. This is one talented individual. I would like to hear what others think. tojazz8
1,Don't Bother,"This review is for all true Doors fans out there. This review is for those who are well versed in the poetry of Jim Morrison. This book is a crock and a waste of time. Although, it is listed very quietly as ""fiction"", many people will miss this and think they are viewing true ""lost diaries"" from the real Morrison. The text itself is a lame attempt to emulate Morrison's voice using overly used cliches and poor metaphors. At times the author tries desperately to insert the theme of ""death"" into the writing as Morrison used to so eloquetly do but it is really like my blind grandmother who has only one leg try to mimic Michael Jordan's fade-away jumpshot. The very ""feel"" of this whole book is false and masked. What a waste of time....please don't bother."
1,Diaries a scam?,"Those diaries of Jim Morrison are probably a forgery. It reminds me of the fake Hitler's diaries a few years back. Furthermore, according to a friend who visited the website for the book, he left a message in the guestbook expressing his doubts about the diaries, and it got changed by the webmaster into a positive review! Many witnesses were present with my friend when it happened. This, already, is a bad sign.I visited the website myself to read some excerpts of the book. The writing doesn't feel like Morrison. It doesn't have this sparkle you see in his poems, and believe me, I have ALL of Morrison's writings. It doesn't feel right.I think that poets in general, and Morrison in particular, deserve better than this. If you love the Lizard King, buy his books, they are all available at Amazon, and pass these ""lost diaries"". Go for the real thing."
1,Never Found,"Don't be conned like I was - I though I was buying genuine lost works by Jim Morrison. This is just pure baloney dreamed up by a fanatic. It's not even good! A man as troubled, vociferous and omnipresent as Jim, could not live in quite exile. I only read a few pages and that was too many. Face it - Jim ""Broke on Through"" in '71 ... ""The End"""
4,Good book - Good Cover - Good Website,"This book shows Jim Morrison as more than just a ""wild man."" It gives him heart even if it is just fiction. I don't understand why anyone would get so bent out of shape about this book. The story doesn't make him bad or good. It is simply a good story...that's all. If you don't like it...don't buy the next one...end of story."
4,Go fro it,If you like Morrison go for it. You will like the book. Wish it had more in otn his wife. A friend said they did not marry. I read they did. ANyone know? Thanks. Cindy
3,GOOD BOOK,IT MAKES YOU THINK. IT REALLY DOES. I LIKED IT A LOT! READ IT TWICE. WISH IT WAS LONGER. WISH IT HAD A CD OF HIS MUSIC IN THE BOOK TOO.
4,Its just a fun book,Who cares if its Jim or not. I think it is cool to imagine Jim on the road. Doing the stuff in the book. I would not be surprised he faked his death. I bought the book and really loved it.Tanya CorbetSt. Louis
2,You get what you pay for,"This battery is of cheaper construction then that of the Canon original. Note the product description does not even mention the manufacturer (although for the price I assumed as much). It works, but only for about 100 shots. The Canon original lasts for about 250 shots. Oh well, it will work when the Canon battery dies."
2,"Did not have high expectations, still let down.","I assume it is a lemon based on the fact that when fully charged, my camera only reads the battery at 25%. With the OEM batteries (2 in the battery grip) I have gotten 1500 shots before recharge. Change one Canon battery with this one, I get 800 on a good day. My Canon battery is 4 years old. I've used this one 10 times."
5,So great,"I read all the reviews here before buying this book and I could not wait to get it, I did and BAM, It's even better then the reviews so far, I would go as far as saying it might be the best Black library novel ever (at least in the top 3), it's incredible, I could not put the book down, I read it in 2 days, and it's just sublime, it mix action, with good story telling (rare these days) with some comedy, just wonderful."
4,Great Handkerchief,My husband loves these handkerchiefs. They are very soft and clean up easily. He keeps one with him every day.
3,Best all cotton I could find but not soft & absorbent.,"I originally really liked these but after repeated washings and use, they have not softened up liked I had hoped and are not very absorbent. Plus they still wrinkle real bad where I had hoped they would relax a bit more."
2,organic canned pumkin,"when I cannot get Libby's, I am very happy to get this. I don't restrict myself to organic. It is watery, however. which requires either straining or altering recipe. This review is for organic caned pumpkin."
5,Great deal!,I was so happy to see this deal. I recently have been using alot of pumpkin. I was so excited to see an organic product that I could actually afford! I look forward to using it in many recipies.
2,Don't buy this product,"I cannot recommend buying this product. I think the manufacturer is fobbing off its dented cans on Amazon customers! Out of a package of 12 cans, only 3 were not dented in the package I received -- and I see from other reviews that I am not the first to experience this. I wish I'd read the reviews before placing my order. I don't think this was an Amazon fault, since the flat was pre-packaged and I think Amazon simply shipped the flat as they received it from the manufacturer. Amazon took immediate and very good care of me in this situation, exceeding my expectations, so I have no quibble with them."
2,Organic Canned Pumpkin,"I was extremely disappointed because out of a dozen cans half were dented. Obviously, the person packing the box should have noticed the cans were damaged. We kept the shipment because we wanted the pumpkin and didn't want to go through the hassle of returning the cans."
4,"Arrived in excellent shape, nice product","I was worried by other reviews that the cans might arrive mangled. However they were all completely fine, no dents whatsoever. The product itself is good quality, nice color, tasty, no obvious faults with it. Mine was not runny, it had a normal pureed texture. Might have just be a difference in the batches/sources. If this product stays affordable, I will purchase it again."
2,All of the cans were badly dented,"The quality of the pumpkin itself is quite good. However, it was just shipped out in the warehouse carton and all of the cans were badly dented. I won't order this item again."
1,Almost all cans were dented,"Sending it back to Amazon. Most of the cans have large dents in them. The bubble wrap around the cans is fine, the box is fine, so I assume the cans were shipped with the dents."
1,Very disappointed with this shipment.,"I was so excited that I found canned pumpkin since there is a shortage at this time. However, almost ever can in the case was dented. I don't know if it was shipped in that condition (poor quality control) or the damage occurred during shipping (poor packaging). I would love to order this again, but don't want the hassle. However, Amazon took the return with no additional cost on my end."
2,All Cans Dented.,"All of my cans were dented. Some cans had multiple dents.If we were told that and / or if they were discounted, I couldmake the choice; however, this was just a case of a manufacturermaking extra money on dented cans and taking advantage of the customers.GDn"
5,Canned organic pumpkin,"I purchase the Organic canned pumpkin for my dogs. Sounds funny but pumpkin is wonderful for dogs digestion. I have been feeding my dogs pumpkin for years. In the past 6 months it has been very hard to find 100% pumpkin in the stores so I started ordering it.It's also good for humans -- pumpkin pie is very healthy and low fat, if made in that fashion."
2,Shipping issues,Very dissapointed in shipping. This is the second time I have ordered and all the cans are dented
3,Farmers Market Organic Pumpkin,The pumpkin was expensive but pumpkin was scarce at the time I ordered this. The product had a pleasing color and taste but the consistency was somewhat watery. I was happy it was organic.
1,What a waste!!,"I got hit by the same problem many others have...dented cans. Of the 12 cans in the case, eight were dented. When you divide the purchase price by the four useable cans that comes to $5.55/can! RIPPPPP OFFFFFF!! As many others pointed out, the box was fine, it was just the cans inside. I planned to return the offending cans, but in the meantime, I opened one to give some to my dog. I thought I was buying pumpkin puree but instead I bought orange water. Now that pumpkin is in stock at my local grocery stores again, I shall return to Libby or Publix brand. You get 100% pumpkin (be sure you choose pumpkin puree, NOT pumpkin pie filling). No water and no dents and most important only $1.49/can instead of $5.55/can. I couldn't give this product zero stars which is what I wanted to do."
2,Another Brand is Better,"There was a pumpkin shortage in our local supermarkets, so I resorted to ordering this case online. Besides the fact that ten out of the twelve cans were dented, I used one can out of pure desperation. Yes, I was desperate for pumpkin. It's watery. It's not solid packed. And using the same ingredients I always do in the dish I used it, it was sub par. I have since sent the product back mainly because of the dented situation - otherwise, I probably would have given it to a food bank or something - they don't take dented cans either and rightfully so! Amazon took it back and I'm sure will be crediting my money. I WISH I HAD READ THE OTHER COMMENTS before I purchased this. Beware of dented cans."
2,Dented cans.,"Every can was dented, I was so disappointed. It looked like it was packed that way, not that they were damaged in the shipping. I also feel that the pumpkin was a bit on the watery side, so not only will I not order this product through Amazon but I will not use this brand again."
3,dents,"I ordered 12 cans of pumpkin. The pumpkin inside seemed fine but out of 12 cans, 9 were dented, some quite badly. I don't think I would order cans on line again."
5,Amazing Pumpkin!,"I have used this pumpkin for several years to make pumpkin pies, muffins, pancakes, and even biscuits.The flavor is excellent, texture is good,, and it's organic. This is the best canned pumpkin I have found.Amazon does a great job shipping the cases with their ""Frustration Free Packaging"" - they arrive without any dents or damage to the cans at all. It comes with cardboard dividers between each can so they don't get banged up."
3,Why the $10 price hike???,I was receiving this on subscribe and save and in one month the price went from $13.42 to 23.51. Why a $10 price hike. Is pumpkin going up with the price of gas? I won't be buying this from Amazon because of the price. It is cheaper locally for the same pumpkin. Shame on you Amazon.
3,Dented Cans!,"I ordered a few days ago and some of my cans arrived dented. Multiple cans were on the outside edge of the box, but only one row (3 cans total with 2 severely dented) was dented. So, I guess packaging could have been a small factor. BUT these cans are amazingly malleable. Simply squeezing the can in my hand caused it to yield. The small area containing air space is very weak. Libby's canned pumpkin, the brand I've used my entire life, does not have this issue.I already cooked with one of the non-dented cans. The color is different than what I'm used to, it's more of a dirty orange-sepia color, and the texture seems a bit thicker, but it tastes fine.My order also had a long expiration date, 2013.(FYI The packaging consisted of a large box containing a smaller box of cans with bags of air to keep it from rattling. There was no damage or excessive wear on the box. )"
5,Excellent Quality,"I bought this organic pumpkin online because it is impossible to find pumpkin locally. I feed my dogs this every day because it is wonderful for their digestion. Pumpkin was recommended by my vet. All of the cans were in great condition. There were just a few minor dents on a few of the cans, not anything serious. The quality of the pumpkin was so good that I would serve it to my family, but we really do not eat pumpkin! An added plus was free shipping. I would buy this again."
4,Pumpkin packs,"The pumpkin I ordered came well wrapped, fresh and was delivered on time. A few of the cans were bent/dropped/mashed, but overall the condition of the package was good."
4,Farmer's MKT Organic Canned Pumpkin,This product is exactly what I wanted. Pumpkin is not found very easliy and it was great to find and buy what I needed.
5,Extremely Poor Amazon packaging/ great product,"Receive several dented cans - I have ordered this product several times. It is wonderful to be used in animal diets. I have been working with animals and it has been a life saver for many animals that I have helpedI believe that it would be unfair to fault the product or the manufacturer. From what I understand from the UPS driver, it Amazon who is at fault for extremely poor packaging practices. For some strange reason Amazon seems to be very cheap with its use of packing tape as well as internal packing."
1,dented cans!!!!,6 out of the 12 cans are very dented! Very disappointed. Please send me 6 more!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was a gift.
5,2nd order with amazon,This is my second order and the cans arrived perfectly packed with no dents on any cans. I am giving this to my basset hounds in hope of helping them with their anal glands issue. But I may use some to make pumpkin muffins. My dogs love the puree in their food and I am glad to give them organic. Although I don't think pumpkins are susceptible to pesticide spray since you dont eat the hard skin and the pesticide probably cannot penetrate the thick skin.
5,Dents don't matter,"Fine product at a great price. Seems that some city folk don't understand that dents don't matter, it's not a plasma t.v. Bring on the dents and keep the quality product inside."
4,Produce Product,"Libby's Pumpkin filling was not available in our area (maryland) and through a search Amazon.com helped us by suggesting a replacement of ""Farmer's Market Foods"" canned pumpkin.......One might ask why is pumpkin so important...We have a rescue pet dog since nov 2009 that has a tablespoon of pumpkin mixed in with his dry food and it provides regularity for him.......He is neither constipated or has dyeria.......Thank youRoger Evans"
3,organic pumpkin,"ALthough the pumkin was good, almost 90% of the cans were dented and some badly. Would probably not order canned goods again."
4,Pumpkin,"My dogs need pumpkin in their diet and it's not available locally. This organic pumpkin, while expensive, fills the bill and my pups are happy. It's good quality. Liked the free shipping."
1,Every. Single. Can. Dented,"All the cans were dented. Every. One. It is as if a child hammered each one, some several times. Then they were shrink wrapped and put in the box. Is there any quality control here? While Amazon will pay for this 12 pound box of unusable cans to be returned and I will eventually get a refund - what a waste. Once returned there will be no ability for anyone to use this product due to the dents - Botulism anyone? Why would Amazon even bother to ship this product in this unsafe and unusable condition?T hey have paid for round trip shipping of a heavy box for no reason."
3,Definitely different than Libby's,"Blander maybe? Not sure whether it is supposed to be this way, or I am just used to Libby's, but it is definitely different. I didn't really like it in my pie, but it has been good to add to things like pancakes and breads."
1,cans too damaged,I have really been scared to use all these cans I bought due to the dented damage to almost all of them.
3,4 out of 12 cans dented,"I HAD to have pumpkin for my dogs so I rolled the dice after reading the mixed, but mostly dissatisfied reviews. One third of the cans were very dented. However, none were bulging which is the sign of spoiled food. We are using the dented ones first without issue - on the third of four right now.I must agree that it looks like a manufacturers ""error"". The dented cans were hidden in the middle of the case, surrounded by good cans. I would bet my last dollar that Farmers Market Foods is using Amazon to dump what they knew wouldn't sell on the supermarket shelves!Lastly, I will purchase this item again, dents or no dents and use it unless it's bulging. But it's unnerving knowing that something sneaky is going on at an organic food manufacturer."
2,Buyer Beware!,"This review is ONLY IN REGARDS to the PHYSICAL CAN. I will review the actual product once I have tried it. But for now please be advised before you purchase------- I read the reviews - Lots of dented cans.... I figured there were so many complaints that it just couldn't still be happening, right? WRONG! 6 of the 12 were badly dented all along the upper rim seams. Amazon did, however, make good on my order with an exchange. Still----- disappointing that the product quality control is so poor with this product after all the bad reviews."
4,Pumpkin. Just Pumpkin.,"Purchased this due to health benefits, be warned the flavor is bland and watery, like unripen raw pumpkin.Purchased case in March 2010- Cans were slightly dented."
3,"product was good, but cans were dented","Several cans I received were dented, three were so severely dented, I had to throw them out. I work in food safety, so I know the possible dangers of dented cans."
3,Won't use for pies; fine for other purposes,"This pumpkin DEFINITELY is not as good as Libbys, which I found very disappointing. The taste really is bland (as mentioned in several other reviews). I noticed it in my pies in particular, they taste much poorer than my usual excellent ones, even when following the Libby's recipe rather than the recipe that comes on their cans. I will use up the remainder of my cans in other ways like pumpkin bread and pancakes where the flavor of the pumpkin has a little less impact. It doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't taste yummy either."
5,It has been great.,This is a great deal and has worked wonderful in all my recipes. We love pumpkin muffins with chocolate chips for breakfast.
5,outstanding!!,just had to issue a review asap. just got my first order in the mail. product packaged perfectly and arrived intact and not a dent anywhere. it seems earlier reviews must have been heard by amazon b/c my packaging/product was terrific. i have been trying to locate this item at an affordable price since a local organic grocer went out of business. im in heaven. the taste is terrific and now with subscribe and save i can get a regular supply and free shipping!! totally healthy natural product that i use for all family (including my pets). one more reason to love amazon!!
4,A good substitute,"I bought this because of the pumpkin shortage (which is now over) to be sure I had canned pumpkin for the holidays. Like other reviewers, I received a few dented cans, although only one was so badly dented that I hesitate to use it. I have used the pumpkin in pie and pumpkin bread. It is a bit less dense than the kind we are all accustomed to buying in the grocery store, but it is by no means watery. I did add an extra egg yolk to the pie to make sure it set up. The pie was somewhat wetter than my typical result, but it held its shape and tasted great. This made excellent pumpkin bread. My family has devoured almost a whole loaf since last night. If you are having difficulty finding pumpkin, don't hesitate to order this product."
3,Too many dented cans,I usually buy this at our local Whole Foods or Harris Teeter it's a great product but when I ordered it from Amazon all but 2 out of 12 cans arrived dented. Amazon quickly replaced the order but in the replacement case 9 cans were dented. That is really unacceptable. They did refund my $ but I really want the pumpkin so I am going to try one more time and order it again and see if I can get a case of undented cans.
2,dents--dents--dents!!,"Ordered this product to have some canned pumpkin--continuing pumpkin shortage at stores. Use A LOT of pumpkin! of 12 cans, 9 majorly dented, 2 minorly dented, 1 OK. Amazon refunded entire purchase price--they don't accept grocery returns."
2,damaged goods,"I received these the other day and 2 cans were severely damaged, I had to throw them out, and 5 other cans came with minor dents. They were packed together so it didn't look like the damage took place during shipping.Edited note:Today is May 30, 2009 and I just wanted to post that Amazon wrote to me and told me this problem has been rectified. I'm happy about that because I need to get these for my dog and at times they are hard to find. Plus it's a great product."
5,"Organic, kosher, and delivered to the door!","Who could ask for more than organic and delivered to the door? Some cans were dented, but it tastes the same either way. I would happily buy it again."
1,tastes like dirt!,"I love pumpkin, my dogs love pumpkin. I quite often roast my own, but I need back up cans now and again. Libby's has disappeared from stores. This stuff is the only brand ANY store is selling. It tastes like dirt. It really does. There is no fresh pumpkiny flavor. It is also watery, which changes how pie and cake recipes turn up. Finally, I gotta wonder-if LIBBY'S pumpkin harvest dried up, where are these guys getting theirs from? A mystery"
2,Damaged Cans,I had damaged cans as well. Eight of the 12 cans were VERY dented. The box was perfectly packaged and undamamaged.
3,It okay,The product does exactly what it says for my dog. However I have found/used other products that were just as effective for half the cost.
2,Every can dented,"Like several other reviewers, my order just arrived and every can is dented. None of them seem to be compromised so I will use them. Just disappointing to receive something like this from Amazon. I know it probably isn't their fault but they are still shipping it from their warehouse. Would hate to receive other products in this condition. Farmer's Market should be ashamed of themselves. Having said that, I am pleased to receive them and so is my cat! I have a feeling that people will be grabbing as much as they can of the 2010 pumpkin crop."
2,"Haven't used in recipe yet, but 5 out of 12 cans were badly dented and it was in a case","Well, I hope this pumpkin will taste good when I make a pumpkin pie next week. However, I don't think I would order from them again since 5 of the cans were really badly dented. Not just a little ding here or there. Bad dents to the point of being afraid to eat it. They had to be dented BEFORE they were packed because they were inside cans."
4,"Get over the dented cans, people","True, the cans often have very minor dents (why they're at Amazon), but at least with the ones I bought the top rims were fine, so you can certainly still open them with a can opener. Given that we need this for our dog who requires in his diet and there is no longer any available locally, this is wonderful to get delivered for what it cost in the stores. Pretty tasty and good for people too!"
2,pumpkinhead,I found this canned pumpkin kind of bland and it needs extra spices to boost the flavor of it.
1,Crappy Pumpkin,I bought this last year-threw it out-I would not buy this for 1 cent-why is Amazon selling such an inferior product??
4,mistaken order,"I did order this item in the fall of 2007, but it was added by you to our order of 12/7/07. You wouldnot allow us to delete it from the order, but we did return it. The organic pumpkin that I orderedearlier is excellent."
1,Very Disappointed,"I loved ""When Hearts Collide"" and so I really looked forward to reading this book. Well... uninteresting heroine and hero who were unconvincing as lovers;strange story that seemed as if it should have been set in the 19th century not presented as a contemporary story. I kept being surprised they were riding around in cars rather than a horse and buggy.The sex scenes were a yawn ,which surprised me after the smoky scenes in her previous book."
5,Tom Tom cables,The cables are just what I was looking for to control my Ipod through my Tom Tom GPS. The only complaint is I can not charge the Ipod while using these cable.
3,Works as intended...but,"The line works fine. BUT, it adds another wire or two to your driving space. And, I don't have an aux jack in my jeep, so I rely on tomtom's FM transmitter which gives static on every ""free"" channel. It sounds terrible and I've tried every suggested station over and over. If you have a aux jack, this will work great, but it would probably be easier to not include the tomtom in your music playing at all and save a wire. So, the wire works fine, but its a waste for me because I don't use the ipod while driving due to the static."
2,Nothing Great,My car stereo could connect to ipod directly using its ipod cable which looks to be a better option in case you want better sound quality. Routing voice through tom tom go 720 and then input to car stereo using auxiliary input audio cable deteriorate the sound quality.
3,Easy solution to shoddy sound quality,Hey guys I was thinking about buying this for my TomTom but heard of the poor sound quality which was a huge deal to me. I normally plug my iPod in through the auxilary port of my car but that will be taken up by my nav system now.What did I do? I went to radio shack and got an audio splitter for about $10. This allows me to plug both the iPod and TomTom into a single port with no interference. The only downside is no controlling iPod with the TomTom but I'm used to that anyway.
1,TomTom iPod Connect Cable and Audio Cable,"This was a useless purchase -- the sound is filtered through the TomTom and not through the speakers of a vehicle as expected; why would anyone run their iPod through the TomTom when the sound is barely audible. In addition, it is hit or miss whether the iPod's music is in fact filtered through the TomTom."
1,"Nice Idea, Bad Product","Tom Tom iPod Connect Cable and Audio CablePros:1) Allows touchscreen control of your iPod on your TomTomCons:1) Sound quality poor and volume was lacking2) Doesn't resume song when turning TomTom back on3) Didn't work correctly with my 3 Gen iPod (wouldn't pause iPod when turning off TomTom, but seemed to work correctly with my iPod Mini)4) Doesn't charge iPodDon't waste your $30 (you can have mine)Harmon Kardon Drive+Play is a MUCH better option for controlling your iPod."
1,One sided loon into Catholocisim,"If you think, as a Bible Christian or a Catholic, that you are getting a fair and objective view of the Catholic church and the Catholic faith, you are mistaken. I don't know a single Catholic that belives the things Mr. McCarthy spewes from these pages. It is a one-sided and unfair look into a faith that Mr. McCarthy knows nothing about. Don't be lazy and take this book at face value! Do your own research and look at both sides before you decide!"
1,very insulting,"I found this book to be very insulting to Catholics, the book is about Catholics leaving the church I was shocked to find this book having Mary on the front what a lousy book"
4,A down-to-earth reflection on Catholic beliefs,The book is structured in such a way that each chapter is an entity in itself. But each chapter has a different focus on a unique doctrinal belief or practice of the Roman Church. The author uses a testimony of the experiences of individuals and the problems they had with the Roman Church. The major Roman doctrine or practice is then briefly highlighted and critiqued with the applicable Scriptural viewpoint. A good easy to read presentation of some of the unique Roman Church doctrines and practices that will give one a general understanding of both basic Christian doctrine and the traditions of the Roman Church from which these unique beliefs evolved.
4,Sunny rules,"I love reading about Sunny, her sister, Elizabeth, and friend Julie and their escapades. Spike and Richie add spice to the mix. I've loved both Sunny books - couldn't wait for Perish Twice to reach publication. It definitely was not a disappointment--a great read with characters I want to read about again and again. If you want a fun book that you can't put down, grab this, a cup of something hot to drink, and settle in for a great time. It's perfect for the beach or a blustery evening! I can't wait for the next book!"
2,Leightweight,"Many of the reviews listed compare this book, and it's protagonist Sunny Randall, with Parker's Spenser books. This is the first Robert Parker book I've read, so I'm not going to try to make that comparison. Instead, I will give you my impression as an out-and-out newcomer. There was one word that kept flashing through my head as I was reading this book. That word was ""lightweight"".The mystery, involving two murders never really became intriguing enough for me to care who committed them. The story never gathered any momentum nor reached any heights. Rather than building up suspense and reaching some thrilling conclusion that had me on the edge of my seat, the story just petered out. No high point to speak of.Sunny appears to be a Stephanie Plum character - only capable and with more boring friends. The shtick with the dog struck me as too cutesy. I'd call this a good beach book, a nice quick read to kill some time."
1,what a boring story !,"I had enjoyed the first Sunny Randall book ""Family Honor"", but this second novel is definetely the last one I shall read. The main character is OK, she is witty, she has a strong personality, but some people surrounding her in this story are just not convincing. That Mary Lou Goddard, a so-said feminist, lesbian, etc. who cannot even smile... i hope i never meet one like that !And apart from Spike and Richie, the ex-husband, all other characters are not even funny. I also felt sorry i did not have a sister, well after I read this book, thank God i do not have one like Elizabeth Randall !The entire plot could be summarized on a poststamp ! booooooooooring !"
3,It Was Okay,"I didn't especially like this novel. But it had some good moments in the book. For Instance, The meeting between the Burkes and Tony Marcus. I Love Sunny Randall but not in this novel. Family Honor was the best Sunny Randall series so far."
1,A Spenser fan - very disappointed,"Now, I love Spenser. I've read every Robert Parker there is. I even like the Jesse Stone series. And the first Sunny book wasn't so bad. But this was just awful.Why? Every female character in the book, and there are many, is weak and pathetic. Except for Sunny herself, who is a Spenser clone in drag. The women are such stereotypes! The lesbian man-hater, the woman who believes she is nothing without a man and desparately runs to personal ads when her own man leaves her, and the woman unhappy with her life who reacts by drinking too much and having an affair.And if that wasn't enough, this is a detective novel in which the detective doesn't solve the crime! Sunny investigates, but can't figure it out, and essentially has a father figure bully the bad guys into telling her whodunit."
2,Rehashing old hash,"After delighting in ""Family Honor"", I was expecting great things from PI Sunny Randall's second outing. I was bitterly disappointed to find what amounts to little more than a contemporary rewrite of ""Looking for Rachel Wallace"" solved by a female incarnation of Spenser. The plot is so banal that when I finished, all I could think was ""Geez, who cares?"" The rest is fillers of psychobabble, neuroses, and non-believable relationship problems. Shoot, the sanest and most believable character was the dog. Maybe Parker should ditch Sunny and let the dog solve the next case."
2,I love Robert B. Paker...but...,"I really really wish he'd stick to just writing Spenser. Sunny is OK. To be honest, if anyone other than Parker had written this book, I'd be happy with it. However, I've come to expect more from Parker. Sunny truly is Spenser in a dress, other than a few crying jags from Sunny, there's very little difference. They have the same asides, the same thoughts, the same obsession with clothes. He cooks, she paints. He has a wonderful girlfriend, she has a wonderful ex-husband. And so on and so on. I wish Sunny could find her own voice."
2,Spenser in drag?,"Really, this is Parker's male persona stuffed into a petite female form. It was like reading Spenser as a weird female impersonator. This may have been my own limitation as a reader, after enjoying so many ""Spenser"" novels -- but it was frankly unsettling and unsavory. Yuck. Parker is not convincing, writing in the female ""voice."""
4,Women Sleuths,I read the first three books in the Sunny Randall Series and liked them all...maybe #1 and #3 a little better than this one. I will read the next one as well. Love the characters and dialog. Easy read. Good mystery.
2,Weak Parker,"I have read every Spenser novel, and greatly enjoyed them. This book is a big disappointment. Read it only if you are desperate for a Parker novel."
1,Getting tired!,"Well, even Mr.Jordan had some bad games. Mr.Parkers second novel featuring protagonist Sunny Randall is a pure air ball. I really liked ""Family Honor"", despite the similarities to ""Early Autumn"", however this is border line self plagerism.This book is so close to ""Looking for Racheal Wallace"" that you would be far better off going and buying a second copy of said book. The issues here, sexual harrasment, sexual identity, are right out of ""Wallace"". Sadly, even Mr.Parkers trademark banter wears thin. I have been a fan of almost all of this authors work, though the last two Spenser novels were not up to par, but this travesty is literary drek. Mr.Parker has been at this genre since the early 70's, with a yeoman like outpouring of work every year, but it may be time to retire his pen."
3,The Reincarnation of Rachel Wallace,"Sunny Randall is back for a rewrite of yet another Spenser book (see Looking for Rachel Wallace). This time Parker really misses the mark, and creates a female character that is simply not in any way believable. The dialogue is witty (as always) but very un-estrogen inspired. The plot and subplots are neither very amusing nor sympathetic - which basically leaves a tough Meg Ryan type and a cute dog. The pursuit of the case is illogical since Sunny has no other paying job; the interplay with the ex-husband is self-absorbed and a little weird. Parker tries to weave in a bit of Robert Frost (thus the title) which does not really make any sense. The conclusion is rushed and ends with what is rather a desperate cliff hanger, supposed to keep the reader hooked on this series? Not me!"
4,Elvis's ghostly presence...,"As with Sinatra, it is difficult to judge songs associated with Elvisbeing performed by other artists. They did not write their own music but owned songs penned by others. The Beatles wrote great music and renditions from all genres of artists is widely accepted. When we hear a song Elvis made famous, no matter how esteemed the performer, the song becomes a shell of itself; and only helps to bring back the memory of Elvis singing it. The Italian conductor Ettore Stratta and the Memphis Symphony Orchestra ambitiously produce this instrumental tribute. The standards of performance and engineering are high. To add authenticity to the mix. There are several musicians(incl. Boots Randolph on sax)that go back as far as 1954, the infancy of Evis's career. When you sum it all up, the whole project lacks one element. Elvis! His ghostly presence will forever haunt us, through his songs."
3,An average test prep book,"This book gives a good holistic view of the GRE but I think it contains insufficient amount of vocabulary. It does teach you some good techniques to max out the verbal section but what I don't like is that the word list is far too short(only 100 words with ultra brief definitions, no examples) and the meanings of other words listed are not given. However I do like the root list which lets you to guess what a unfamiliar word might mean but again, definitions are not given. Should you look for a book which has a more comprehensive word list, the GRE book from Barron's might be useful to you, at least it gives you 3500 words with definitions and examples on how to use those words."
3,GRE Exam Verbal Workbook,"An okay book to use for to prepare for the GRE. The vocabulary builder section is particularly useful; however, I did not feel that there were an adequate amount of questions for the price of the book. There were helpful tips and strategies, but nothing new if you already bought Kaplan's GRE 1999-2000 workbook."
4,"portraits,Abe Franjdlich","As a photographer,a collector and one interested in portrait photography,I find Portraits an interesting approach to the art. His approach is to engage his subject in a collaberative effort by making reference to,commenting on,or joking about the subject and/or their work. When successful the result is a shift in perspective away from the formal sufficient to provide a glimse behind the curtain,therby revealing a dimension not usually seen in similar work."
1,What happened to Chapter One?? Book Missing Pages!,"Okay, out of all the books I've ever ordered on-line or bought at the store, this is a first. Opened it up and it starts on page 17! No introduction or Chapter One! (I guess they feel I don't need those!). I looked in the back and I have the footnote sources for them so either my book is defective or they want me to just look it up myself. My advice to you....don't wait a month to finish your current books to glance in the new ones you get like I did. You might just get one of these 'be a mindreader' books like me!"
5,A First Rate Biography,"Jean Strouse has written a well researched, first rate biography. She dispels the myth of J. P. Morgan being a 19th Century greedy capitalist. After all, he almost singularly saved the United States from financial collapse. All aspects of his life are handled meticulously; from his childhood, education, going into business with his father and finally taking over the reins of the business, to his outside interests including art collecting, travels to Egypt and extra-marital affairs. It is all there . One marvels on how accurately Ms. Strouse describes his financial dealings making them understandable and fascinating to the general reader. The description of late 19th Century America and how the rich lived rounds out this wonderful book. Perhaps most importantly, after finishing this book, one feels that he knows Mr. Morgan, big nose and all."
2,Dreadfully overwritten.,"Biographing someone as remote and uncommunicative as JPM was a Herculean task at which the author proved quite mortal. The man is titan of 20th century economics and finance, yet by the end you only knew that he was involved in US Steel and the Northern trusts. You never gained a sense for the Morgan's vision. The author focuses hundreds of pages his collection of artwork. So much so that it would be better titled Morgan: Art Lover."
4,Some flaws but good overall,"It took me 10 days to read this book, which shows it was not as engrossing as it might have been. (I read Ron Chernov's Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr. in 5 days, tho it is just the same length as Morgan.)Since I am not much interested in the stuff that Morgan bought, and this book splatters so much information about that in the book, that aspect of the book was a drag. The financial aspects of Morgan's career seemed worth reading to me, tho I suppose the book's account of them is not as informative as some could have made them. I was repulsed by Morgan's hypocritical disregard of the morality he felt was important, apparently for others only."
2,Can't finish this beast,"I am sorry, but I can't cut through the filler material to get to the point of this book. The author boasts about her access to never-before-seen source material, then bores us to death with every last detail. Events and people are included in excruciating detail, which have only a minor connection with Morgan himself. If you are not completely dedicated to reading this dull one for weeks or writing a college paper on Morgan, this one will be difficult to finish."
2,A ponderous biography,This biography of J.P. Morgan is a yawner. Wading through this book lets you know about Morgan but you never get to know the man.Strouse goes into mind numbing detail on his art collection and mistesses while lightly touching on his financial deals. She follows tangents to the point of losing the reader. At times it felt as though she just strung all her notes together to make this book.The very rare nuggets to the understanding of Morgan are not worth the time or money.
1,Completly unimpressed,"As an avid reader of books about America's ""gilded age"", I could not wait to get my hands on this book. I am sorry to say that I was completly and totally unimpressed. If you are familiar at all with Morgan, you will find Jean Strouse's handling of his business career to be very superficial. Unless all you are interested in is his female companions or his so-so art collecting this is not the book for you."
1,Life's too short to waste time reading this thing,"I honestly tried to finish this book but gave up on pg. 368. The only thing I can figure is that Morgan was himself an extremely boring person -- why else would Strouse spend 85% of the text on peripheral people and events only remotely connected to Morgan? If you are interested in things like: why Grover Cleveland's potential successor, William C. Whitney was opposed to the gold standard, then by all means, read this book! Otherwise, find something the least bit informative or entertaining to read. Life's too short to torture yourself with this monster of a biography."
3,Financier or art collector?,"JP Morgan was a financier and was maybe the most powerful one between 1880 and 1910. This book reads like a novel - which is not necessarily a bad thing - but unfortunately does not explain how he came to such prominence; Jean Strouse merely notes the facts but fails to explain how the deals were done or why JP was so good at his job. I would have liked a little more insight into the world of finance; instead, we are treated to an in-depth review of his art purchases, with the price, provenance and shipping details. In addition, we know who he beat at auction to acquire the pieces. I cannot believe that JP Morgan simply had all that money at his disposal - he must have done something to make it; we never learn how. A little long, stingy in the financial details and overly detailed in the peripherals."
4,"bit overlong, but interesting look at the man","it amazes me how one man was able to accomplish so much (he was the organizing force behind general electric, u.s. steel and various rairload empires) while also taking off for long periods of time to visit egypt, collect both art and girlfirends, etc. . . . the financial parts of book were interesting, but i enjoyed even more how morgan's human side was presented . . . bit overlong for my taste at nearly 700 pages, i would nevertheless recommend it if you want to learn more about this era of american history."
3,subscription expires,subscription expires after using it for a year. not sure how to renew subscription.i thought it was life-time subscription. bit disappointed.
1,Completely wrong!!!,"I thought I had done my due diligence in searching to make sure this product was the right one for my Tom-Tom. It was not and it will cost me more than what I paid for it to return it. Shame on Tom-Tom! The seller got it to me quickly, so I really have no problem with him."
1,deception,Deception about this item because I didn't know you needed to pay a subscription for it. So usefulness!
3,Traffic receiver - TMC module GPS,"I feel good to have it but it rearly helps me in my daily chores - most suggestions it makes via my TomTom are totally radiculous and not worth paying attention.I think this product is a generic one - not TOMTOM's original, hence the low price. I'd get really pissed off if I paid the originaL $70-80 dollars asked by TomTom..."
3,"If you have a 540T you do NOT need this, as one reviewer of the 540T says...","I bought the TomTom 540T and one reviewer said that you ""must"" have this antennae to make the traffic portion work...so I just went ahead and bought it. Well, it doesn't fit in the gps because there is no port for it--and the traffic receiver is built into the 540T's lighter-power plug.It's not worth the headache to return it, and I have a friend who has the model that uses this antennae, so I'm giving it to her (even though she already has one). But just an fyi--if you have this GPS, (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B3P2CE/ref=oss_product)it doesn't work and you don't need it. All you have to do is plug the thing into the lighter outlet BEFORE you turn it on, and it will recognize it."
4,not bad,"Received reception at 97.5 in NY. Shows some traffic, but often none is shown while I am siting in it. no problems with reception."
5,"Works great, perfect travel size!",This mouse is great for traveling. Its small enough to fit in any pocket of any bag but big enough to comfortably use effectively. I have had this mouse for about two years now and haven't had any problems with it. Would highly recommend this mouse for the avid traveler.
3,its alright,ok first off this is a good game right up until like the 3rd mission it is IMPOsSIBLE but if ur just lookin 4 a game 4 2 players and u want to have good choices this game is 4 u u can do dogfight duel onslaught kamakazi or bombing run ya also tha arcade mode sucks terribly
4,A different kind of game,My son wanted this game because he is learning about WWII in school. It is proving to be a challenge but he loved it!I loved the price for a Wii game.
5,epic game,my first war game just let me say pretty goodgraphics 7/10story 10/10missions 9/10score (that means music) 9/10controls 10/10get it
3,Nice game but not fantastic,"It's fun, but there are some glitches in the game that make playing it not as fun as other games. Maybe I have a bad version, but the game play is definitely not addictive; which is disappointing. I would like to believe there are better air combat simulation games on the market. I enjoyed Ace Combat 4 more than this game."
4,Good game but can be annoying,"I'm not really much of a gamer and I bought this game to just blow stuff up. I also wanted to get a sense of what it was really like to fly the planes in the different situations. It was really annoying at first that I couldn't access many of the features without progressing through the game. Once I googled for the cheat it was a blast. I liked the realism of the Wii platform, although the graphics aren't great."
4,A few annoying features,"I enjoy this game, but one feature in arcade mode bugs the daylights out of me. You can be chasing a Nazi plane and have it in your sights when suddenly the game takes over your controls and says ""returning you to the battlefield."" You then have to wait several seconds, all while the game clock is still ticking, until you can control your plane again.In other words, the Nazis can fly off the battlefield, but you can't pursue, even if they're in your sights. More annoying, you get no kind of indication that you're about to leave the battlefield; you'd think having an enemy plane in your sights would be a good indication that you're still ON the battlefield."
1,not much fun,"First impression was that this would be a very fun game.But within 20 minutes of playing, reached a point in the game where I could go no furthur. After a week of playing, still got stumped at this one particular point and could go no furthur.So frustrated at this point, I sold it on an on-line auction at a big loss. Would give it negative stars if I could."
4,O.K. for the money,"Keep in mind that this is not a $60 game. For flying around and taking some shots at the ""enemy"" it is o.k. It is not rocket science and is fairly simple to understand. For the money it is well worth it. After a while you can fly with some skill."
5,Righteous,I had more fun w/ this game than anything else I've played. I probably spent close to 200 hours on this bad boy - lots of replayability.
2,Blazing Angels shot down,"Maybe I'm used to PC platform games but this one certainly does not measure up. Unless you finish a mission without missing any targets, you fail and have to replay. So rather than working through a campaign with some losses, you end up in a perpetual ""Groundhog Day"". That gets boring very quickly."
2,terrible,"I've been playing flight simulators/dogfighting games for over 10 years. I can honestly say this is the most frustrating I've ever played. The controls are like lead and the missions become difficult right off the bat. Poor instructions and objective add to the frustration, as you will spend a great deal of time just figuring out WTF you are supposed to do. I had to resort to walkthroughs just to survive the training mission. The game is also buggy and froze on me more than once in the brief 2 weeks I wasted my time on it. Save your money and check out the Ace Combat series instead."
1,Life is Stressful Enough,"If you enjoy getting angry at video games, by all means, run out and purchase a copy of this fiendish attempt at a flight simulation.The Wii controller is no match for a proper joystick and the game does not include rudder control for proper flight dynamics. You'll find yourself drifting in the air trying to get a bead on your opponents, while trying to beat an impossible deadline to shoot them all down.I snapped my disc in half after numerous attempts in the Henderson field mission: try landing your plane while it's on fire and the controls are shot up. If you're using the simulation settings, your plane will not fly straight and the arcade settings aren't any better. You'll end up making a crater regardless of how careful you set it down.Life is stressful enough; I'll stick to X-Plane for my Mac, made by intelligent programmers who understand real flight dynamics."
2,Too hard!!!!,"This game was hard!!!! Wii needs to improve before this game was published. It took forever to pass the first level and I was stuck on the third level. I think this game was made too hard. Actually, this game should have been made with Wi-Fi to play against other people around the world. Buy another game!"
2,very poor,"I played this game for 30 mintues, my eyes got really bad, I can't understand why the graphic are so bad, that it is almost unplayable. Please go rent it before you decided to buy it."
2,"looking for clean, excellent fun","Our nephew, who loves WWII, wanted this for Christmas. We were unable to get it for him because it contained inappropriate language. Wish companies would produce clean games we could purchase that did not contain swearing. In the last few years we've had to throw away games, and return this one due to inappropriate language. Too bad this has to be included as a part of the experience. Many families don't want it. My son refuses to play games that contain swearing, and has commented that you used to be able to turn it off, but not anymore."
2,OK as a Game; Not a Flight SImulation,"If you just want to blast around the sky shooting things... this is your game.If you are concerned with historical performance, forget it.The Gloster Gladiator out performs The F2A Buffalo in this game ...In real life the Buffalo was significantly faster, better armed and armored (any beats none), rolled better and had some 150 to 300 more horsepower.It's only one example... another is the ease with which the Hurricane II eliminates the Ki-43 Hayabusa.Don't the Britsih pilots of WW 2 wish that was the case, as they suffered badly from the Hayabusa's performance.Hopefully someone will make a decent flight simulator for this system."
3,"Cool game, controls glitch.","I really enjoy the theme, concept, and visuals of the game but the nunchuck controls have a tendency to need constant synchronizing for some reason."
4,A Very Good Game,"Blazing Angels is an entertaining game. I don't know very much about war tactics or planes used during WWII and at first was worried this would limit my enjoyment of the game. This was not the case - the game is fun and has a good storyline with a wide array of challenges. Plus, there are many different control options. You can choose to use the default Wii controller and nunchuck or even just use the controller itself without the nunchuck. Either way, the Wii's controls are great and let you fly the plane easily. Though the graphics aren't the best, I highly recommend this game."
4,He loves it,Bought this for my beau (he LOVES flying games) and he played for hours. He said he had this game for another console and this version is far better. Great game for the price!
5,"Great Game, Great Value","This is a great game for a great value, there is not much more to be said. Others have gone into the game details, I am just throwing my support behind this amazing game. I just wish they would release the sequel on the Wii."
3,fun but very difficult for arthritic hands- need cheat sheet,I love this game- definitely addicting. I played for hours.But my 60yo arthritc hands couldn't get high enough scores to gain the skills needed to advance to different campaigns. So I didin't want to go back to prior very difficult campaigns only to find I couldn't get top scores I needed.I wish that I could go to different battles. I tried the published cheat sheets but still couldn't advance. THey need a senior version that cuts you some slack.
3,Great value,"While this game is a bit old and lacking in some visual refinements, it is now a great value for the money, provides many levels and it a neat way to relate to the airplanes of World War II."
5,kids loved this,A big scream of BLAZING ANGELS rang out when they opened this game - so far they love it -
2,Not so great...,"The game play is difficult and hard to maneuver. I couldn't get past the second level no matter how hard I tried. The game would freeze up a lot and I'd have to completely restart the Wii to get it going again. I like the idea of the game, but the game itself is a disaster."
3,Perhaps limited by the WII,"It's ok. The graphics are what you expect from the Wii. The game play is very arcade, not very simulator at all."
5,Highly Enjoyable For Anyone Interested in WW2 Planes,"Growing up in England a short while after the WW2, I have always wanted to fly a Spitfire and a ME109, and this program allows you to without going to all the effort of learning a true flight simulator. Blazing Angles neatly deals with the period before the US entry into WW2 by following the story of an American volunteer in the RAF so that Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain can be included - before we all dash off to the Pacific, etc., etc.. The historical maps of the campaigns are well done and might well end up teaching kids more about the actual course of the war than they would get in their history lessons at school which seem to only cover domestic aspects of the World Wars.Oh, and flying a Spitfire - even by proxy - is just as much fun as I thought it would be..."
3,Decent Game,"This is a decent game for anyone interested in the airborne battles of WWII. The controls are a little tricky to get used to but once you get the hang of it, it is addicting. The graphics are ok. I dont play it all that often but it's fun to pick up and play every once in a while."
2,Build with anti-american accent...,"Player can get through all levels until reached battle of Guadalcanal.There is no way to win that since at last check point aircraft became uncontrollable. Basically it is controlled by the game and user has no way to win it.Even if user gets aircraft on the ground as I did (checkpoint reached) - it exploding and you need to go all over again...Fun in first 3 levels, not bad in ace mode or arcade."
1,Not good,Disappointed that the makers of this game felt it necessary to use The Lords name in vain during game play. For that I give the game the lowest possible rating. This game went into the garbage can. No further review needed.
1,Blazing Angels,"Don't waste your money unless you are into frustration. In both the Training and regular missions, the enemy plane is always behind you and no matter how hard you try, you can't get behind them and you get shot down. They have a time limit for the dogfight of 3 minutes, if you get 1 out of 12 of the enemy planes you are lucky.I'll pass!!!"
5,Love them,I had just bought a new car top carrier and I have always removed the manufactor's logos and replaced with these.
4,Yamaha DVD/SACD carousel,"Being used, unit arrived a bit dusty, both inside and out, but was quickly cleaned and worked just fine. The loading mechanism doesn't inspire confidence even though it hasn't failed. Difficulty in finding a DVD and SACD combo yields it an extra star."
1,"long on anecdotes, short on practicalities","This was my first and last experience with Bradt guides -- in the future I'll stick with Lonely Planet. It seemed to be written more for people who like to read about travel and fantasize that they will trek in the Madagascar wilderness than for those who actually find themselves trying to find lodgings after a late night taxi-brousse stop. Far too many personal anecdotes and far too little practical info (and what there was is not always accurate -- FYI, the lemur sanctuary is much farther from Andasibe than the map would lead you to believe)."
3,disappointingly average remixes,"This is really only worth owning if you love U2's Pop phase, and their exploration of electronica. Most American U2 fans didn't care for it but I thought it was some of their most innovative work. Even though I own nearly all of their singles, this particular disc is a tough sell because it's only got 3 tracks, and none of them are very strong. #1 and #3 are good, but only mediocre when you compare them to U2's catalog of great remixes. If you're looking for U2's 90's sound, you would be much better off with the Achtung Baby singles. I don't regret buying it, but then again, I buy every U2 song I can get my hands on. If you don't like U2's ""dance"" music then you should stay away from this one."
3,Glad I didn't spend too much!`,"I purchased this hot air brush dryer after seeing the commercial for the much more expensive high end kind. I had my hair cut shorter than usual and thought this item would be good to dry and curl my hair under. I figured this way i could try it without spending sixty plus dollars. It did well drying my hair quickly, however to curl it you have to twist the whole thing and it didnt grab my hair very well. There were a couple times that it would get a little tangled but easy to get out for the most part. It added tons of body, which i already have a lot of. All in all i think it did what it says it does, its just kinda a pain to get the back hair and i think a round brush is much easier."
3,Okay lightweight finishing dryer/curler,This is light enough to keep at work for those times when your hair needs a little help. It works pretty much as other's reviews said; definitely not for thick hair or for completely drying your hair. But the big plus is that it's very lightweight
5,great product for women,Vidal Sassoon tangle free hot air brush styler is an awsome product. I 've been using this product for 15 years now. I absolutely love it. I was very dissappointed for a while because I was not able to find it in any department stores. I am very glad to be able to get this product at Amazon.
3,It's OK but not great,"The pros of this curling dryer are:It has very low wattage 250w so uses much less electricity to get the job done than most blow dryers that are 1200watts or more.Relatively low temperature doesn't get your hair so hot that it leaves your hair feeling dried out, frizzy and crispy.Dries your hair....eventuallyDoes accommodate some stylingConvenient for travel as you only have to take one appliance - this blow dryer - rather than a blow dryer, brush to use with the blow dryer and maybe hot rollers.Cons: The low wattage means it takes quite some time to get your hair completely dry.If you want to style and dry at the same time you can only do one small piece of hair at a time.It also looks and feels chintzy - no substance to it to speak of.-----------------------------------------------------The most desirable thing about this dryer is that it's very convenient to pack it in a suitcase and also I did notice that my hair looked shinier after using it to dry."
4,Really like it!,"Small fan that is built into handle blows heated air out of roller holes, does dry hair much quicker to help speed up styling time. Release button on roller also is nice. Con: Thought it had a smaller diameter barrel when I ordered it, but was able to take barrel off of older one and switch it to this handle, WORKS GREAT!!!!!!!!"
3,Great at First...,"When it works, I really like it. However, it overheats in a matter of only a couple of minutes, and has become useless to me. I can't even make it once around my head an get the ends of my hair touched up before it shuts down on me. I've had it only 6 months, so am really disappointed."
1,Only for those with super-thick hair.,"This styling brush is a bit underpowered, but the far bigger problem is that the bristles are so far apart from one another hair just falls off of it! Unless you have a LOT of long, thick hair, this tool won't work, and if you have thick hair, I'd expect the weak heat/fan would be a problem. Double or triple bristles and the hair could actually stay on the brush, but as is, it just falls flat."
5,Best one,I have bought several and this is the best one I have found. Good price. My first one lasted over 2 years. Others might last longer don't know but ones I have paid more for have a harder brush and the ones with metal shafts get to hot.
2,Not What I Expected,This is not quite a hair dryer nor a curling iron. If you want a little body after your hair is almost dry then this would be a good tool. I do have thick hair so mine takes awhile to dry which is why I may not be satisfied with this purchase.
3,The Wife is very happy!!!,"Being a male with less hair than I had when I was younger I won't be rating this product,my wife will. Let it be said that she wasn't happy with the product for only one reason. The barrel was 1 inch and she wanted one with a smaller brush because she has short hair----------now how was a guy to know that??? So I sent it back and got her one with a 3/4"" barrel. That is the reason for only a 3star rating."
3,"It's practical, but don't expect miracles","If you are good with your hands, it helps a litte bit. It does not entangle my fine hair, but the curls come up quite lose, and do not last long."
1,Over heats and shuts off after only 4 months of use.,I expected more from the Vidal Sassoon name. I really liked this styling tool until it started to over heat and shut off after about 3 minutes. My hair is not thick or long and I have only been using it for about 4 months.
4,"Not for everyone, but works for me...","This is the 4th hair styler like this that I have owned. It's perfect for my short,thin, fine hair. It probably would not work for longer, thicker or more full-bodied hair. I would imagine it would tangle easily and would not be powerful enough.That being said, it does have a downside. It overheats fairly easily and spontaneously shuts down as a result; and this seems to happen more frequently the older the styler becomes. However, I've learned to always have a back-up one just in case. This may seem like a major issue for some people, but I find that this type of styler works the best for my hair, so once I became smart enough to always have a second one on hand, I don't find it a problem."
5,Best Product for fine hair,I bought two of these because I dropped and broke mine and I couldn't find one in the stores. You do have to be careful not to catch the base of the strand you are curling or the styler will get very tangled and the release feature doesn't help. But I still think this is the best product for one-handed styling of fine hair. Others I tried had a very large handle which was uncomfortable in my hand or had so much power that my hair would blow all over the place and the style would blow right out. With practice I've learned not to get it tangled and I couldn't style my hair without it.
4,"Works great, but keep one in reserve","As many reviewers have commented, this product tends to have a short life because it overheats. It works wonderfully at controlling curly hair. I have had several of these and am trying to extend the life of the current one by drying my hair first with a blow dryer and just using the styler when the hair is nearly dry."
3,"Not A Tremendous Amount of Power, But Good For Final Curl.","The Good:1. The hot air brush has the right kind of bristles - soft tip rather than bristle brush, so you won't have hair/bang breakage;2. The brush does a good job of setting a curl in your hair;3. This is not a complicated brush - 2 settings only.The Bad:1. If you are expecting to dry your hair with the air brush styler, you will be unhappy. The brush has very little blow power/force, thus making the styler only good for setting a curl, not drying a curl in place (unless you have hours to dry your hair);2. There are only 2 settings - high & low. Since the brush doesn't have much power to begin with, I've never tried the low setting.I had a difficult time trying to find a hot air brush with soft tip bristles. This one will do, but it wouldn't be my first choice if there were real choices out there."
2,Hot Air Brush,This product is not very good for styling. Good for drying your hair but does nothing for styling.
3,Vidal Sasson Tangle-free hot air brush,This product is fair. It will get Tangled in your hair be careful. Does not hurt your hair and it is easy to use.
1,It won't stay running after 5 minutes!!!,"When you use the hot air brush, it works fine for 5 minutes, it suddenly stops, then will not turn back on. It doesn't matter which outlet, I have tried multiple... There must be a short or glitch in the electrical system because it will turn on again after about 30 minutes. And, no it is not a breaker because other items electrical items will work just fine. Very, very annoying to say the least!! I would return it, but the shipping would cost me more money and I won't put another penny into anything related to this product."
5,very satisfied,"I had this product for several years when it tried to die, but my husband fixed it w/duct tape. This winter it gave up the ghost so I was on the hunt for another to puff up my short, straight, fine hair. I looked in all the retail stores, but no one had a medium size barrel w/plastic tips. There were big and small barrels and there were brush like tips (which can get caught in your hair). Finally found my faithful product on Amazon and was excited the day it arrived! I have always used a blow dryer to get most of the water out of my hair and then used this great airstyler to finish it off. Takes me about 15 min. total."
1,Hot air brush styler,"The first one received did not work at all so returned for replacement. The replacement arrived. On high there is almost no hot air coming thru, totally worthless. Do not recommend that anyone purchase."
3,I like it,I really like this product although like others have said it does overheat and if you turn it off you have to wait until it cools to turn it back on. So I just don't turn it off. It works great for a few weeks then start to overheat. eventually it will start cutting off when it overheats and that is when I have to order another one. Maybe that is the manufactures way to keep selling them.THis is the best hot air brsh I have found. I can't do the bristle type brushes. They just can't hold my hair.
1,Don't buy this item,"I was really looking forward to having this item, to shorten my ""ready"" time, as my hair is thick and takes a long time to dry. It worked great the first time I used it, although it did have a mildew smell. When I plugged it in the second time, it was totally dead. It never worked again, and it wasn't worth sending it back. Beware...................."
5,My Favorite Styling Tool,"I have been using this item for over 15 years. I buy a new one every year, but lately haven't been able to find it in stores. It is the perfect styling tool for shorter hair styles. Gives volume that lasts."
3,Vidal Sasson VS433C,"This product works fine, my only complaint is that this product was shown when I searched for a revolving dryer/styler, 1"" diameter, soft bristols. This revolves.... But only to ""release"" the hair from the rod. I was searching for a styler/dryer like the infinity.... But in an 1"" size curling rod."
3,Not a dryer,"This may be a very good styler,however it does not do a good job of drying the hair. Could be for those with less thick/coarse hair."
5,Found It!!,I've been looking all over to replace my old one that stopped working. I like this model so much I bought 2 this time. So glad Amazon had it - I trust them. My order came quickly and at the best price on the web. Thanks!
2,Bad Odor ! (2nd review & order! ),I love these brushes and was delighted to find themon Amazon. But they must have been packed away in a ship holdsomewhere before retailing as I have had two now that had the same strong smell ofmildew in their air output when 1st using them.This has largely dissapated over time but causes me to rate a VERY useful tool with three stars.2nd review - more than a year later! - Just bought two more of these through Amazon.I can't believe the smell that was there in the first order over a year ago is present inmy brand new brushes.VERY STRONG MILDEW smell that infuses my hair/the whole room with that odor.I'm seriously thinking of returning them. Boo hoo! because it's a great tool otherwise.
1,Curling brush blow dryer.,I returned this item. I have thick straight hair and this brush dryer did not have the blowing power to dry my hair quickly. I'm still using my blow dryer and a curling brush.
5,a great hot air bruxh,This is exactly what I wanted. My old one like it broke after many years of good service. The heat comes quickly and the rubber bristles are soft enough but firm enough. I love it!
4,hot air brush,"have used Vidal Sasson in the past and the products always gave good results. the 1 inch barrel is a bit bigger than I needed, but works out. Long hair may get tangled up, so it's better for short to medium length hair. I have bought this item for less, but was unable to find it in my local stores, therefore I purchased it on-line"
1,Hot Air Brush,"This item broke when I used it only two times. Not good quality, and I probably need a larger roll, the brush was kind of flimsy and it would get tangled with my hair."
2,Misleading description,"The description for this product is completely misleading. The brush doesn't rotate at all. I'm not sure what ""rotating vented barrel"" refers to since nothing moves. I received one brush which didn't rotate so I contacted Amazon. They were very helpful and sent me another brush which also doesn't rotate. I called the company to find out whether they were both defective or if the description was wrong. I was told that the brush does not rotate. Both Amazon and Vidal Sassoon were extremely helpful when I contacted them but I am very disappointed not to have a rotating brush. That being said, the brush does work on my hair if I manually roll it on. I have very fine hair. I do turn the brush on a few minutes before I plan to use it since it takes a few minutes to warm up."
1,Died within 2 months,"This product worked well but started hiccuping within 2 weeks of purchase. Within two months the motor stopped. Although it states to clean the lint filter, there is no access to the lint filter. Amazon's return policy is within 1 month--so I'm out the $15 (Oct 2012). Will go to brick and mortor store for next purchase, return policy is better for products that stop working before their time."
1,Did not work,Unfortunately this thing did not work at all. Very little heat and the spinning part did not spin. Not worth the effort to pack up and return. I guess there is a reason why it was so much cheaper than similar products.
5,Best hot air brush!,"Love this hot air brush! I've used this product for over five years. When my local stores stopped carrying this model, I was elated to find that Amazon had it. It works great on my above-the-shoulder, fine hair!"
2,dont waste time oor money,"Not hot at all. Just warm. Doesn't do any styling, just barely leaves a wave. A bar dryer and brush work better !"
2,False advertising,The only thing I liked about this order was that it only took a day to get here! Down fall.... DOES NOT work for all kinds of hair. I have very very thick hair and it would not curl or dry it properly without leaving it hard and damaged! I have returned it and getting something worth my money. ONLY buy if you have very fine thin hair
1,Didn't work.,The Vidal Sasson Hot Air Brush styler and dryer has almost no power. It does not do the job. I do not recommend this item.
4,Nice smoother,"I have used something like this before, but i really like this one. My hair is very curly, so I use this after using the blow dryer with the round brush to smooth it out. I've also used it after letting my hair air dry and when it's almost dry I use it to help smooth out my curls. You don't want to use this on really wet hair, it doesn't work. It would take you an hour to dry your hair, so just use it more for smoothing your curls."
2,only so so,This tangles in my hair if I am not careful. There is a handle release but once the hair is partially dry it becomes more difficult to detangle. When my hair is shorter it does okay with the curl but if it gets a little too long (my hair length is to my shoulders) then it does not style well. It does an okay job of drying. Not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush.
1,TANGLED -- horrible hair loss,"On my first try, I got so tangled that I spent 2.5 hours ripping hair out of the brush and still had to cut the thing out. If the product hadn't been ruined by all this, I STILL wouldn't dare to use it again. I had a similar brush for years and never once had a similar problem. Stay away!"
3,Lasted only 7 months,"I love using this type of device for drying and styling my hair, to avoid using a hot iron as well. Unfortunately, I seem to need to order a new one every six or seven months. I suppose I am glad that they only cost $15...I can't seem to find another blow brush that has these solid plastic bristles that don't make my hair full of static.UPDATE: So after reading other reviews, I saw that one person suggested using a toothpick to clean out the vent at the bottom of the unit, and now the dryer works perfectly. I wish I tried this before I purchased a new one!"
1,Does not actually rotate automatically.,"It says ""rotating"" right on the package, but the only way it would ""rotate"" is by manually turning it around and around. Annoying, and not at all what I was looking for. If you're looking for one that rotates for you this is not the one."
2,ITS DOES NOT SPIN,ITS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT SAID IT SPINS AND IT DOES NOT NOT HAPPY DOES NOT CURL MY HAIR EITHER
3,"Not for curling, good for managing crazy hair","Recommended if you want to easily straighten your hair, or keep it manageable. It's easier and simpler than using a blow dryer and brush.NOT recommended if you want volume or curl. Also not recommended if you like to dry your hair completely. It does not curl well, and it's difficult to get volume out of this. Also it's going to take at least twice as long to dry your hair completely because of low output."
1,Toshiba doesn't care,I purchased a Toshiba HDTV for $4500 in 2000 from Amazon.com. The tv went out this past June 2004. The authorized Toshiba repair site informed me that the the digital convergence board needed to repair the set was discontinued by Toshiba. Toshiba customer service told me they would do nothing to help me repair the set nor would they give me any consideration towards a new set. Think long and hard before purchasing an expensive set from Toshiba. They obviously do not care about their customers or their reputation.
1,DON'T BUY IT AT AMAZON.COM,"DON'T BUY THIS TV. ESPECIALLY FROM AMAZON.COM. THE PICTURE SUCKS. THE IMAGE IS SO SMALL ON STANDARD BROADCAST TV THAT YOU MIGHT AS WELL BUY A 13"" CHEAPIE. WHEN YOU STRETCH THE FRAME EVERYONE LOOKS LIKE THE NUTTY PROFESSOR. I GOT RIPPED OFF BY AMAZON WITH A DAMAGED SET, THAT I DIDN'T NOTICE UNTIL THE GOONS HAD LEFT IN THEIR TRUCK. IF YOU DON'T KNOW ALREADY, AMAZON DOESN'T TAKE TV'S BACK, DAMAGED OR NOT. BUYER BEWARE, GO TO A STORE THAT HAS A RETURN POLICY AND PAY THE REAL PRICE."
4,This Is a Great TV for The Money,"I received mine today and the picture and sound are great. I also love the size of this TV as it isn't much bigger than my old 27"". You'll obviously take a bit of a risk buying a 30"" TV off Amazon given that they don't let you return it, but their price on this TV is also lower than any other place I could find."
4,Good product for the price,"I have this on my deck holding up a rather heavy umbrella. The wind during a thunderstorm has knocked the combo together over twice but otherwise it has held up well. The design is very nice, sturdy, heavy,great color, hasn't worn out in the weather. Great product for the price."
4,Perfect for long hair,I find this product to be great for myself and wife as it is able to go low for a mans hair and yet still have plenty of power for a womens thick hair.
5,nice,okay every one this is weird as hell lol dude dies and come as a taxi driver for undead it is awesome could do little more i wanted it longer tell u truth the fight at end was sweet i wanted it last longer car chase ghost trying kill each other awesome . but yea guy dieds meets two killers be came friends with them then he met a little girl she want leave him alone she needs his help to get revenge on her killer who is alive and in fact is the guys best friend before he died and then some evil ghost wants to go back to human side ill let you watch to see what happends sorry cant tell you whole movie lol it is real good i think you should give it try.
4,It works,Have an old SMART700 that I have replaced the batteries on once before. This is round two and the UPS keeps on running...
4,no fuss - just slide it in,"shipment was on time, packing was great!check with tripp lite for issues when battery fails in first place.! computter was summarily shut down with no close program commands when the battery failed! (the very reason we have back up power in the first place) there could easily be an early warning for several days when the battery life was getting close."
4,tripp lite,"The battery wnet out and I bought a new one. My Tripp Lite was bought in 2003, and I have now bought a newer model. It has saved my computer more than once."
2,did not fit the case,Well the price was right but I expected it to fit in the Tripp Lite case. It did not... & I had to get out the old snippers and trim off all the excess plastic in the battery compartment (lucky I could do that otherwise I would have returned it!)
1,Bad Battery,Both the batteries purchased were bad and could not be charged & used so ultimately we had to throw the UPS's and the batteries. Tried charging it several times. It should be less that 1 star but that is the least available to rate the same.
2,Not a Tripp Lite Battery,The product description is totally misleading by saying that this is a Tripp Lite Battery. It is not. The batteries delivered to me were made by an unknown company in China.
2,No 'Fan' of sci-fi.,"Though wildly inventive, the elements of science fiction in this work feel grounded by humanity and spirituality. I still actively disliked almost all of the stories, though I was never disinterested in the fates of the characters. Ryman is an absorbing, daringly unconventional writer, with an anthology worth perusing just for a taste of the unique.Why two stars, then? I think Ryman's works will find real appeal in only serious fans of the sociological and/or political science fiction genres. Unless you're just looking for novelty."
4,Works Great.....But,"I bought this to use with a 10"" Delta saw but upgraded shortly after to a 10"" slide miter. I was afraid that the stand would be too light to handle it, but it has worked out great. The only complaints I have are that the wheels are too small and the little spring buttons to release the legs are hard to reach and difficult to press in while holding the stand up. For the price though, it would be hard to beat."
2,Not satisfied,The assembled stand was wobbly. Folding and unfolding the legs was very difficult. I returned it.
2,Critique of stand #PM4400,"The ad implied that this stand was sold specifically for the hitachi miter saw I purchased from Amazon. It was a 4-hole mounting instead of a three hole, which required an additional configuration.--Misleading. Also the mounting of the saw on the rails and the picture which it showed was,I believe,wrong and resulted in the saw falling off of the rails and cracking the case of the new saw, which I had to tape together. The stand itself is ok but I would rather buy one I saw at another retail store designed for the 3 hole model and had a better grip on the saw."
3,Not Bad For the Money,The stand works fine and will probably fit your saw. It's just sturdy enough to get the job done. Like everyone else I found that the push through holes did not work and had to be modified. It took about 2 hours to fit to my saw and repair the legs.Don't fill out the registration to get the free clamp. They sent me a catalog instead! I hate companies like this. I won't buy anything from HTC again.
2,Missing item,"I was not able to use this stand since the two aluminum extrusions were missing. I called customer service at HTC and spoke to a ""real"" person. He was very cordial and apologetic. That was two days ago. I am still waiting for the part. This stand seems to be what I am looking for without spending too much for a ""professional"" grade miter saw stand. I won't know until the part arrives!"
3,yes and no,"bad points:1) the supports are always at about a 10 degree pitch. (I suppose I could bend them to get them a little straighter). still usable though.2) with my saw it was difficult to mount either using the forward or backwards method (I have a 10"" bosch compound sliding)3) with the wheels mounted on the base (vs the legs) the unit isa bit tippy when you move it. be carefull.4) as much as they say you can remove the saw from the base .. yes you can, but a little awkward to use when its been removed.good points:1) solid construction2) small enough to fit in station wagon / minvan (and fits thought doors)3)portableWhould I buy againYes, anything else that fit my needs was too big to move in my car my car. I do wish the supports where straighter"
2,Promises/Promises,"The idea behind this stand is great, it's simple, compact and easy to transport from job to job. But when I recieved it there was some damage to the carton and scratches in the powder coat to the bare metal. I contacted the manufacturer and was promised a small container of ""touch-up"" paint. That was months ago and I have yet to see the paint. As for the product, it's great for light molding but the extender arms are not strong enough to support anything beyond crown molding and it's difficult to release the leg buttons when you install the wheels on the frame. The wheels can be installed on the legs but that makes it hard to fold the legs without laying the saw on the ground."
3,yes and no,"bad points:1) the supports are always at about a 10 degree pitch. (I suppose I could bend them to get them a little straighter). still usable though.2) with my saw it was difficult to mount either using the forward or backwards method (I have a 10"" bosch compound sliding)3) with the wheels mounted on the base (vs the legs) the unit isa bit tippy when you move it. be carefull.4) as much as they say you can remove the saw from the base .. yes you can, but a little awkward to use when its been removed.good points:1) solid construction2) small enough to fit in station wagon / minvan (and fits thought doors)3)portableWould I buy againYes, anything else that fit my needs was too big to move in my car.

4,Good but not perfect,"I agree with almost all other reviews and would recomend this stand if you accept the following:1) The instructions are not real good and it will take some time and maybe cursing to assemble.2) Mounts square base saw (Only tried DeWalt, it fits great)3) The snap locks are horrible, I have to push mine out with a scewdriver when set up and they don't lock when folded. After buttons pushed out it is stable and safe for work.The plus side includes the low price, free shipping, and it is very stable once set up. If you can handle a few flaws to save money it is a good deal. You will be happy if you expect a very functional but not perfect item. I would buy this item again for homeowner use. I don't move it around a lot and don't use every day so the flaws don't bother me much. If I made my living off these tools I would want a better one."
3,Benjamin Diamond - There Is A Girl,"The driving pop confection of THERE IS A GIRL gets an acoustic treatment here on this EP. Benjamin Diamond shows that he's just as adapt as crafting a bass hook as describing how the music sounds better with you. The acoustic version goes sunny as a picnic. The b-side, ""Lost in the Crowd,"" tosses some reggae-offbeats into a pure rock, replete with squealing electric guitar. Nifty."
5,My inclination would normally be...,"God, I am a pretentious jerk I HATE the fact that I'm giving the one ""other than minimally produced"" Beat Happening record 5 Stars...but there it is. This record is brilliant. Though I love even the cutesiest Glasgolympia crap, this is another creature entirely: powerful, adult, redeeming. If you've tried other Beat Happening records and had difficulty tuning in, do try this one."
2,needed reworking,"This is an old Linda Howard story that needed reworking before republication. It's not just that it's not PC [dominant alpha hero and the little woman yet again], it also doesn't have much story line or hold up to close inspection. The couple is stranded together in a hot building, so they strip. Sure. Just how hot would you have to be to take off your clothes in front of a man you didn't want to have sex with? Am I the only one who gets a bad headache when she gets too hot? The whole thing is too obvious a contrivance. There's better Linda Howard out there."
3,Love Linda Howard,"The only reason I bought this book was for the Linda Howard story, Overload, which was amazing. She is a great writer, and I was really looking forward to reading this story. I was not let down. Elizabeth works in the same building as Tom Quinlan, whom she used to have a romantic relationship with, but she broke it off. One day (on a day with a heat wave) there is a power shortage and they get stuck in the building together. Tom is glad because he really wants to know what went wrong in their relationship. This story tells you that and more. It is amazing how much Linda Howard packed into less than 100 pages. The other story was ok, but like I said, I bought this for Linda Howard, and I was not let down at all in that respect. So, if you are a Linda Howard fan, I would definitely recommend this book."
1,A re-issue that should have stayed in the vault,"Elizabeth and Tom had a torrid romance at one time, then she dropped him with no explanation. Making matters difficult for the pair is the fact that they have offices in the same building, and one evening, both find themselves trapped in the building during a power outage caused by a heat wave. Elizabeth just wants out, Tom wants answers. Faster than you can say ""what a stupid..."" they have their clothes off (it's hot) and soon are mounting each other left and right. In typical Howard fashion, the male is dominant and the female is a doormat, and after a night of hot sex decide they're soul mates.Howard's dated story reads like an entry in an anthology, and is simply not good enough to warrant a separate printing. The dialogue is weak, the character development minimal, and at 144 pages (large print no less), you would be better off borrowing it from the library."
4,condition was good,I had no complaint.When ordering a book that old you just hope there is still one out there somewhere. The book was actually in better shape than I expected.
5,An ideal book for young readers,"The jokes fly fast and furious in this case where a suitcase containing a dummy is switched for one full of loot. The dummy, Charlie McShtick and the ventriloquist, Edgar Bergman are the central characters as Mathnet detectives George Frankly and Pat Tuesday use mathematics to solve a series of crimes. The mathematics used is that of a connected graph where the graph tour is used to prove innocence and point out the potentially guilty parties. Of course, the villain has the last name Snerd.My oldest boy who is now ten enjoyed the book immensely. He liked the story line and how the mystery was solved. The only problem was that the jokes about Edgar Bergan and his ventriloquist dummies referenced events before his time.This book is a true treasure in that children can solve a mystery, laugh at the jokes and learn mathematics all at the same time. I also laughed and groaned my way through it."
5,The core values of secular humanism,"In this eloquent little book, Paul Kurtz expounds upon the three core values of secular humanism: courage, cognition, and caring. The section on cognition can be somewhat heavy going at points for non-philosophers (and frankly I disagree very much with the pragmatic emphasis) but most of the book reads like a sermon. This book offers inspiration without appeal to religion, and will challenge those who think atheists cannot have high standards of personal conduct and civic duty."
5,Very Happy!,I was looking for BIA Bistro rimmed soup/pasta bowls and found them on Amazon and at a price I was happier with than at the local kitchen shop. The bowls came quickly and in great shape. I love the new rimmed bowls and have added them to my Bistro collection.
2,Size indicated is not correct,"I was specifically looking for these bowls and was very pleased to find them on Amazon rather than to have to search the stores for them!I had 6 bowls already and needed 4 more for a dinner party I was hosting.However, when the package arrived, the bowls were smaller than the size mentioned in the product description. They are not 10""x10""x2""but are 3/4"" smaller in circumference and more shallow as well. Needless to say, they did not match the ones that I had, and they had to be returned."
1,"Different style, and boring","If you like Jean Michel Jarre for his old style music, like, equinoxe, oxygen, chronologie etc... don't waste your money. This album is not for you...."
3,This is interesting,"I have listened to the Session 2000 and I thought it was a breath of fresh air..cool,mellow,jazzy,It was nice. It was good not his best work but good.I especially liked Metamorphoses which is a prior release to this album. Funny how you cannot get the whole JMJ collection in the states. I think that is sad.But as for the Sessions it is an overall decent allbum.I just wish JMJ would come back to the US for a show or two."
1,"Quick, Call the Gendarmes. Somebody Kidnapped JMJ","That has to be it. Or else he was abducted by aliens and they left a clone of him that just doesn't ""get"" the music. This is noodling, no theme, just dial up a piano patch and play...throw some gunshot samples on top, hold the sustain pedal on those pad sounds and head out to lunch. I own every JMJ album and the best thing I can say for this one is that it fills out my collection."
1,A different kind of JMJ music,"I am a big JMJ fan and have bought every single CD he has made. Jarre has been exploring new grounds in this CD as he has done in album before this one. Both albums seem to miss being archetypal electronic music that stikes a chord with the soul and that has made JMJ a leading electronica musician. Sessions 2000 should have been named Jarre 101, because Jarre seems to shy away from his genius and drop to levels of much less talented Jazz artists. The music is ok in general, but if you are a Jarre fan like me you will be somewhat disapointed."
3,"It's mellow, man!","I was wondering recently how JMJ was getting on, and then I received an e-mail from Amazon.com about this new album. I not only ordered it, I also ordered Metamorphoses, which I hadn't even heard of!I've bought all other previous JMJ albums, except perhaps for one or two live albums, and I've liked most of what he has ever done.Sometimes he gets very mellow, like in some of the Waiting for Cousteau (a.k.a. En Attendant Cousteau) tracks, but those are mellow and abstract. The Sessions 2000 tracks are all mellow, but with a slight jazz feel to them. Many of the tracks have nice use of bass, so listen on good headphones or speakers.I'm not complaining about spending the money on the CD, all the tracks are pleasant enough, but I'm now even more curious about Metamorphoses, which I'm hoping will be as good as the reviews suggest it is."
1,Jarre in Crisis,"I have been a fan of electronic music since high school in the 70's. The year I graduated, 76, Oxygene was released and I was captivated by Jarre's music. This continued with every succeeding album until 2000's venture: Metamorphosis.What on earth happened?From then on I listened to the albums at the shop before buying. You can imagine that I didn't buy them as they were all so awful.My wife commented that his music went downhill since his split with his wife. Something she had noted with other musicians - she's a musician herself. While we both also like jazz, this mish mash of dull, aimless tunes that we heard from the local library CD apalled us both.I agree that some will like it, some won't. Sometimes being a diehard fan can blind you to an artist's obvious faults. Those who see them are often castigated. Jarre, for me, is going in a direction that I don't want to go"
4,A great tool for planning what to read next,"From Los Angeles to northern Minnesota, do you have a favorite mystery setting and want to read more about the same area? Or, do you want to know what books are set in a specific place? If so, check out The American Regional Mystery. The book is organized by region, state then subcategory. For example, subcategories in Minnesota include weather, Minnesota Indians, Scandinavian roots amd more. Books that bear on each aspect of a region are noted (for example, William Kent Kreuger's excellent first novel Iron Lake is listed under Minnesota Indians) and often quoted. At the end of each section is an expanded list of books not specifically called out in the text. Despite some typos here and there, this is a terrific reference for the avid mystery enthusiast."
4,Very nice wallet,"This ""Floto Red Leather Coin Clutch"" is made of very nice leather, and I love the small size and functionality. The only slight complaint I have is that the picture makes it appear to be a brighter red than it actually is, which I would have preferred. Otherwise I am very pleased with the quality and the look."
3,Biographies of all the Airmen who received the Blue Max.,"A good overview of Germany's famous airmen of World War I. Not only are the fighter pilots reviewed, but also Zeppelin and seaplane pilots, observers, and the the generals that reorganized the air service. Some criticism of what should have been in the book:1.) drawings of the Allied and German aircraft2.) drawings of the medals recieved by these German airmen.Also, the grammar was not right in some cases, especially when referring to months. A good overview of the heroes of the German air force in World War I."
3,Good.,"I totally agree with the reader from Shalimar, Florida, who said this book cannot be read in only one shot, cover to cover. Why? Because it deals with fast biographies of 81 airmen from Germany in WW I. Each og the histories are interesting, well documented, but it only makes you wanna know more!"
4,Not a PCs book.,"Overall I found this book fairly useful, the creatures, and especially the spells were useful to me, and for a DM who loves a little undead action, I found the undead prestige classes a must have. However, had I been looking at Libris Mortis from teh players perspective, I may not have had a positive review. The prestige classes, to me, seem to be the only viable option for players who are alive. So unless you are running a campaign where all your PCs are undead, this book will not appeal to them. It simply doesn't give enough content to the PC to be worth its list price."
3,What's the point?,"I agree with the first reviewer that in fact one buys a DVD to actually watch something, and in this case the orchestra. Although the sound may be a bit better on an DVD Audio, why don't you just get a CD (which is much cheaper)?By the way our friend (the second reviewer) fails to mention that in fact DVD can also stand for Digital VIDEO Disc. I buy DVD's so I can watch them.If the DVD sound is better, would it be that hard to also include footage rather than just have a still photograph?"
5,Excellent,Easy understanding. The way he teaches makes it less stressful and fun to read. I'd highly recommend this book. He also has several others that are just as good. I enjoy his technique!
5,A STRONG AND MOVING COLLECTION,"This is certainly a strong collection of nonfiction about daughters and their parents. ""Taking Care of Charlie,"" by Cathleen Calbert, is gripping, with some humor too. And ""Chocolate,"" by Mary Anne Maier is the most moving piece of all. I admire it for its content and impeccable form, and I reread it periodically. Maier takes us with her on a quest to come to terms with her mother's death, but along the way we are given insight into the author as a daughter and as a human being."
4,FYI for the reviewer looking for BK Loren book,"Just wanted to let you know, since you mentioned looking for a book by BK Loren, that her first book, The Way of the River, will be published in May 2001."
3,Dutiful Daughters,"I have read only one essay from this book. It was reprinted in a magazine called The Sun, and I was so impressed with the story, and could relate so well to some what was said, that I am going to order the book to read the rest."
4,the best gift,"i adore the illustrations on all of these lovely cards. i have purchased a dozen of them to give to friends at the holidays because most of my friends have all the 'things' they need but everyone can use blessings and good wishes: the more the better! Thee cards are small enough to mail without paying a fortune in postage.i also give them to all new babies who come into our neighborhood. the best gift for a new or an old soul!i'm thrilled to have found them at amazon.i do have trouble with some of the actual bedtime wishes printed on the backs of the cards. it seems like this part of the project could have been better but, maybe because i'm so visual, the art work is substantive enough that i overlook whatever shortcomings the actual texts may have."
5,"A poignant, compelling book","Wendy Pearlman, a gifted writer, has succeeded in capturing the human dimension of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza. Through a series of vignettes and interviews with people from all walks of life -- ranging from filmmakers to students to doctors and more -- Pearlman brings an entire nation to life. Readers learn about the Palestinian perspective through regular people, not government spokespeople and negotiators. If you like books that open your mind to new thoughts, new cultures and new perspectives know that this book accomplishes that in spades."
1,no good,"It will not fit the H10, i got it on halfway and it would not go on and i had to cut it to get it back off. This is junk"
1,less than 1 star,"Ordered, paid for and then notified from Jos A Banks that no longer available but can't get a credit for my payment"
4,nice compilation,fortunately the earlier reviewer has no idea what he's talking about... this is a compilation from Virgin Records and is an import here in the states. it features some of the better artists in the electronica genre. the only thing bad about it is the import pricing.
3,Question to sellers or buyers...,Could you please list the artists/songs that are included on this compilation.Thank you.
2,disappointing,"I think if you haven't heard 90% of these songs or artists ever before, then maybe it might be woth it. The second cd comes off especially rancid in that cheesy, overly-chilled flavor of downbeat, etc. The first disc has hits, but they are the same hits that we heard a looooong time ago. It sort of seems to fill that ""introducing electronica to those who are clueless"" need as a compilation. You'd do better to buy some of the original albums by prodigy, the chemical brothers, propellerheads, sneakerpimps, moby, bjork, fluke, the orb, orbital, etc etc to find out about house, big beat, trip-hop, and some of the more popular forms of e-music, then maybe progress to some richie hawtin (aka plastikman), amon tobin, mouse on mars, squarepusher, matmos, and kid 606 if you're feeling more adventurous. This compilation just isn't worth more than, say $12 (I paid $30- aren't I stupid?)..."
4,MISSING A LITTLE SOMETHING---,"For some reason, I cannot really connect with the characters in this series. They're missing a dimension for me and they seem to keep changing personalities. That aside, it was interesting to learn about the ex-fiance. The culprits were never really well-developed characters though, so the ending didn't impress me."
4,"A little too much Mary Sue, but a good mystery nonetheless","It's so painfully obvious that Skye Denison is intended to be Denise Swanson that sometimes it's a little distracting. This is something that really could have sunk the book, but the mystery itself is pretty solid and the other characters are quite entertaining. Swanson has a knack for developing her red herrings and winding them throughout the plot, which is what a good mystery writer should be able to do!"
2,A bit too much relationship angst,"Unless you're okay with a lot of female relationship angst mixed with your mysteries, I'd steer clear of this one. A decent mystery is completely smothered by the main character's personal love life and drama. Reminds me a bit of the Goldy series by Diane Mott Davidson and the Hannah series by Johanna Fluke. If you're big fans of those series this will probably appeal to you. If you don't want the facts and crime muddled by a lot of wishy-washy emotional turmoil, I'd opt out.I'd classify this book as cute but forgettable. A decent weekend read if you're into cozies."
4,Another twist in the Scumble River Saga,I am really enjoying this series from Denise Swanson. The characters are so real-I think I've met these same people. The situations that come about add spice to story. Never a dull read.
5,"From the mystical, magical heart of Christmastime!","Chanticleer is an audaciously talented acapella choral ensemble whose work finds its best expression in spiritual songs like these, which are stunning missives straight from heaven itself. The spirit of the season of Christmas, the promise and beauty and renewal at the heart of it, is so perfectly captured in these soaring and robust performances, each one more impossibly lovely than the last. You don't need to believe in Santa Claus or even Christmas to derive deep satisfation from this album; you need only have ears to listen and the capacity for extreme goose bumps! The hush of a snowy day, a cathedral filled with candles and voices lifted heavenwards, the abundance of genuine goodwill and loving kindness that has survived every attempt at commercializing Christmas ... these things are alive and well in this music, which will move you to your core.Highly, highly recommended!"
5,Sing We Christmas,"There's not much more I can add to the glowing reviews of this CD except to say that I'm surprised that ""A un nino llorando"" doesn't get a mention! It became my favorite on the album, even though the rest are excellent also.""A Christmas Carol"" is quite serene and nice, as well as ""A Virgin Unspotted"". Perfect! These guys are the musical male answer to Anonymous 4."
4,17/18 perfect,"This is a NEAR-perfect Christmas album. If we could permanently erase track #17, their god-awful attempt at some Gospel recording, it would score a perfect 100! Everything else is as beautiful as it gets. Don't you know, that's the track that gets twelve whole minutes."
5,The best Christmas CD I have,"This is the best Christmas CD that I own, and I own MANY! I am a professional choral singer and this is as perfect as it gets. Here is the Little Door is nothing short of stunning. I recommend every song on this CD and it should be part of anyone's Christmas collection."
1,Every time,"Every time I leave a negative review there must be some mistake. Well, I run my music through my computer to my stereo and speakers. This cd would not run because it was copyright protected. So all I can do is play it in the car. At least warn me so I can make a buying decision."
5,Wilson Tennis Bag,"This bag is very good quality. It is nice and roomy, more than enough space to hold all my gear. It arrived in a very timely manner exactly as promised. The price was unbeatable. I paid for a 6 racquet bag what most sellers were asking for a 3 racquet bag."
1,NOTHING LIKE A CANDLE TO WARD OFF DEMONS,"Noel's family has fallen into darkness. Dad is a drunk and is divorced. Her brother has a trashy sleep over gf. Her sister smokes pot and has sex with strangers, and mom is going out to get drunk and pick up men. Mom tosses away Noel's toy dragon she got at the mall...ready...because it invites in demons.Yes a demon does show up.I did like the make-up on the demons. The rest of the movie was bad. The sound was very bad. You could hear the people on the left side of the screen clearly while the right side was muddled. The acting was about as good as the bad script would allow. The plot? It seems to blend New Age religion with Christianity which the box calls ""Gnostic.""F-bomb. Sex. No nudity."
1,"THIS MOVE BITES, RATHER WATCH NOTHING",THIS MOVIE IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE IT IS LIKE A HOME MADE MOVIE THAT WAS JUST MADE UP WITHIN 1 MONTH AND THEY PUT IT ON DVD. THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY AND I WOULD NEVER WATCH THIS AGAIN THIS WAS THE WASTE OF MY TIME. I WOULDN'T EVEN SELL IT TO YOU IT IS BETTER IN THE TRASH THEN IN MY COLLECTION OR GIVING IT AWAY
2,earphones,"These earphones are not as pictured, so they cannot be used by me. I would return them if there was a way to do it."
1,BUYER Beware - Have a Needle & Thread Ready,My son was so happy to get this toy for Easter. Unfortunately the back opened up in first washing. I washed on gentle cycle in a pillow case like requested. What a disapointment after reading such great reviews - guess the company is getting cheap with the thread. Don't recommend unless you plan on making repairs...
5,New York's Finest...,"I guess with such a rigorous concert and touring schedule there is little time left for recording sessions. In my opinion making the N.Y. Philharmonic one of the great least recorded orchestras in the world. I don't usually go for the type of excerpt program laid out on this disc. Three years into Kurt Masur's contract(1994)they recorded this 60 plus minute Tchaikovsky waltz album, live! I assume this was made in conjuction with an Avery Fisher Hall performance. The engineers give us a spacious recording with concert hall presence. The sweet music makes it all the more attractive. Taking this as a whole it is interesting how Viennese the waltzes sound as to make you forget you are not listening to Strauss. For a sophisticated well played mood record, this is tops! Eleven years after it's release you can own a modern N.Y.Philharmonicrecord(the type that Bernstein use to make) for less than the price of some budget issue with similar program."
4,Easy-to-learn from Video,"This video contains instructions for three Latin dances--rumba, cha cha, and salsa. Greg Gale provides the detailed steps systematically and from various angles. He teaches the footwork (and arm movements) methodically that enables the viewer (with use of the rewind/review buttons) to follow and learn the dance steps (he spends little time on how to dance with flair and artistry). With each dance, Gale teaches four to six basic steps clearly. Each dance lesson is concluded with a practice session where Greg Gale and Nancy Hays puts together in various combinations the lessons learned (and where Gale is more relaxed and conveys the enjoyment of the dance). Practicing repeatedly what is learned from this instruction-tape, one will be able to enjoy oneself on the dance floor. [NOTE: Your local public library may have a copy of this dance instruction tape.]"
3,Recliner,"A decent chair for the value!! A bit of difficulty in the assembly process. For having only nine fasteners, the process took well over an hour. Alignment of openings was the biggest challenge. For my application of the chair, in my motorhome, it's suitable."
3,swivel tilt recliner,"we love the color and the contour, but we can not figure how to get the chair to tilt. we have tried several things. could you explain better than directions. we have sat in it and leaned and pushes our back.please help"
3,It's just OK.,Bought this for our motor home to replace an inoperable chair. Wanted something that matches and reclines. Well it does both but it is hard to operate. The recline handle is stiff and takes good arm strength to move it. It also sits a little lopsided. Will keep it as it does match other furniture well but not as happy for the price I paid.
1,Very poor quality!,"The chair was very difficult to assemble - it took two men, one of whom is an engineer! The chair itself is too big overall, the leatherette doesn't feel good, and it's uncomfortable. Too high off the floor to sit up in, hard to recline. Back is large, seat is small. I don't recommend it at all. (However, it does hold up well to being thrown across the room by the person assembling it)"
3,Pretty good for the price,"As a woodworker, I was a bit disappointed in the overall craftmanship of the product, but it's a great oganizational box for in the drawer. The top on mine was slightly warped but, as I said, it's a good product for the money."
2,"clever stories, not engaging for modern audiences","The Decameron consists of 100 stories, linked together by the thinnest of narrative devices. Some of the stories are clever, and many reveal things about customs and attitudes in Boccaccio's time. However, storytelling has changed a lot since the 1300's!The stories in the Decameron are told in a very skeletal way. There is little dialog, and no character development. Without these things, the stories are flat and unengaging.I would recommend this book to students of history, or writers looking for plot outlines. I would not recommend it to general readers because the stories simply aren't very well told, by modern standards."
5,"Gives you a feeling of "" Being with Ramana the Master ""","This Book cannot be rated .Its simply spectacular and incredible ....Hats off to the Editors and Matthew Green Blatt for doing such an awesome job. This book may be the only friend , guide and philosopher you might need in your journey ... to understand that you are the one whom you have been searching for.. "" I was Lost and now I am found "" ......Makes you go inside the depths of your being ...Above all photos over 50 yrs have been given life and once you tune yourself you see the Master pulling and pushing from within and without. Be Blessed with this Little Book !"
5,Remembering the Self,"I would recommend this book to every spiritual seeker of truth. The truth already IS,there is nothing to add, and Ramana Maharishi's teachings help you to discard all that is not the truth of your being. All you need do is remember who you really are. And then your Beautiful Self stands revealed. I would also Recommend The wisdom teachings of Nisargardatta Maharaj, and also all materials by David R Hawkins(Power VS Force, Eye of I and (I)This will help you to avoid the pitfalls and spiritual trapps that can delay true spiritual attainment. And finally waking from the trance by Stephen Wolinsky. Once you truly grasp these materials, you can stop searching.Blessings to you."
4,This is the way the story should progress.,"I enjoyed Mr. Griffins latest work about the Corps. It set the stage for the Gobi adventure that we have heard so much about in the previous Corps books, a mission the was always put on the back burner. As far as the ""inaccuracies"" go, I do not read books like this to find out the airspeed or range of a Catalina. There has to be some artistic license. Also, if you are concerned about "" character development"", then read volumns 1 thru 7. Please hurry with volumn 9, Mr. Griffin."
2,Where's the action? Don't blink or you'll miss it!,"Considering that the book was billed as a great adventure novel, where is the action? Don't blink, or you'll miss it as it is crammed in the middle of Griffin's rehashing of old stories. and let's not even talk about the inaccuracies."
3,A good book but....,"Another good book in the Corp series but still haunted by mistakes in continuity, that have plagued the whole series. I believe Mr. Griffin needs a good editor for this series. Between The Corps, Badge of Honor, and the OSS series he is stetching himself to thin. An interesting storyline that manages to catch -up on characters like Milla Banning who I was beginning to think was forgotten. Only one real question about previous characters....what has happened to Joe Howard?"
4,Excellent yarn in the Griffin tradition,Very-well told story of the continuing saga of Ken McCoy and his compatriots as they fight WWII on an arena not-so-typical. This book has less of the errors in continuity found in other books in the series. I look forward to reading the next book in the series.
5,"Absorbing, compelling, but full of annoying inconsistencies.","I stayed up all night finishing it and wished it were longer, but was annoyed with the inconsistencies with the previous books in the series. I've read each of Griffin's books at least twice and know the characters well--I only wish the author and his editors did, too."
3,547 pages of buildup to a climax and 2 pages of story,"I really like Griffin's books and am eager to find a new one. But, I was disappointed in the ending of this book. Griffin spent 547 pages building up to a gathering of all his characters and then left me feeling empty at a few pages of the gathering occuring and then ending. I expected more story at the end and the book probably could have lost 100 pages in the middle and added another 100 at the end."
4,Good but we're losing track of the Real Marine Corps,"Griffin knows how to write a story and yes the Corps has a very colorfull history, but it seems like Griffin is going into too much detail compared to how he wrote the Brotherhood of War series. I think Griffin is a wonderful writer, just too much detail and taking forever with the Marine Corps series. Get back to the Real Corps and the real heroes."
5,Best Corps saga yet...,"If you don't like Griffin's characters, then I'm sorry, but we just don't relate. While this may not be a barn-burning, page-turner like the better Clancys or Ludlums, the characters are just so real, so endearing, and so incredibly COMFORTABLE. Griffin's series on the Corps does not focus on major battles or blood & guts, but if you read for pleasure, and if you have even the slightest interest in accurate representations of military life and WWII in particular, this one's for you."
5,An excellent continuation of the series and great story!,"W.E.B. Griffin continues his excellence in story telling and moves to resolve some of the conflicts set-up in the previous eight books of the series. His literary talents and excellent ability to tell a gripping story, that leaves you wanting more, has not diminished. The movement of the ""loose cannons"" of USMC Intel. Special Ops. into the O.S.S. ""Oh So Social."" Takes you to Allied and Axis occupied China with intelligence, great dialog and sharp perception of the historical personages of this story. Buy it! You won't regret it or any other of his books. He continues to rarely disappoint."
3,Below par of his other works.,"Mr. Griffin is starting to stray from the premise of the Corps series. What got the series started, and kept so many people coming back, was the intimate details of the individual Marines' lives. The first books in the series brought to life the ""Old Corps"" and its expansion throughout WWII. However, the series has become too involved in the political aspects of it, especially with the OMA's personnel in the OSS. Mr. Griffin needs to refocus his attention and draw back the drifting readers he's begun to lose. By the way, Mr. Griffin needs a better editorial staff. Upon their return from the Phillipines, General MacAurthur presented silver stars are awarded to the officers and bronze stars to the enlisted men. This presumably took place in early 1943. However, the bronze star was not introduced until later in the war. These mistakes alienate many hard-core military enthusiasts."
2,Out With a Whimper,"I was greatly disturbed to find out that the Corps series is finished. The main characters at the beginning were exciting and very intersting to watch mature over time. McCoy was the main guy, a true everyman who became a leader in spite of himself. As the series developed, I, as a former Marine, wondered, with all the dalliances going on, how we ever got anything done-much less won the war. This theme runs through all Griffin's series that I have read. It would be better if there was more battlefield and less bedroom action. This last novel has left us all hanging with no end in sight. Come on, wrap this thing up. Let us know what happened to the real heroes, Stecker, Pick, McCoy and the other junior officers and enlisted. Not one more word about Malcolm Pickering, let him fall face down in his ""Famous Grouse."" I'm truly intersted in the Banning dilemma and how Pick and Weston resolve their differences. Let's bring the boys home, W.E.B. finish the series."
4,historically accurate,Good story with very believable characters in factual background. The series format makes the books able to portray thr complexity of the actual historical scenarios
5,Best Corps Book Yet,"The best Corps novel yet - characters are very complex and well developed, the plot moves quickly and the WW II technology is very interesting. Characters we have grown to love are shown to be quite complex - Gen. Pickering is troubled by having to learn to play the politician's game; his son, Pick, pays the price for his immaturity; Ken ""Killer"" McCoy is becoming a prisoner of his ruthless competence and the women - well, read it yourself. His best effort yet."
3,This Corps novel has less character development.,The adventures of the Corps series characters continue. The new reader would do well to start at the beginning of the series as the characters are very sketchily drawn here. The plot involves a Gobi desert mission and the action picks up after a slow start. Not as good as the last two but fans will want to keep the story going.
2,dissapointing end,"I have read the entire Corps series, back to back. FIrst off, this was a dissapointing read as it wasn't the Corps, but the OSS. Second, I am tired of Brig Gen Pickering being the central character. I was much more interested in what the enlisted and lower officers were up to, rather than Pickering's big boy problems.I wondered what happened to Jack Stecker's son - he was a great character. Would have liked to see more of Pick, although was dissapointed that he turned out to be more of a playboy than a Marine...but I loved the interaction between Pick and McCoy and Stecker's son.But what I really object to is that although I understand this is the final book of the series; it didn't wrap up all the loose ends. Sorry but I want to know what happened with Carolyn once she found out Mrs. Banning had been rescued. Who got Martha? How did Weston solve his woman problem? Did McCoy marry Ernie? Did McCoy get out of the Gobi Desert? Did Donovan incur the enduring wrath of the President??"
3,Standard W.E.B. Griffin fare,"Nothing overly special about this book. Griffin stands true the the schitck of his genre, mainly 1) Deflowered Virgins, 2) Rich Playboys in the military service, and 3) Enlisted men who must become officers by the end of the story. If you can deal with that, its no better or worse than the other books in the series.However, there are serious problems with continuity in this book. Names and events that took place in prior books and are remembered in this one are so inaccurate, I'm seriously starting to suspect that after Book III or so, these things are being ghostwritten."
3,Not enough Marine action. Too much lust. No fighting.,"Having looked foward to the next installment of ""The Corps"" series I was greatly disappointed by the venue and premise of ""In Danger's Path."" The battles that took place the South Pacific during World War Two were among the most dramatic, exciting and tragic in American military history. It seems that half the book is devoted to sophmoric and boring love affairs of Marine officers that quickly wear thin. The book chose as its theme a most uninteresting topic and left the reader unfulfilled."
4,Quality Dora Lego Set,"This Dora Lego set is generally of high quality. My two year old likes to play with it -- especially the Dora and Boots figures. He is a little young to put all of it together himself, but he gets it out a lot. My only negative would be that the mat the Legos are placed on is only made of flimsy cardboard, but it's not really essential to the set."
4,Good toy for our daughter.,Funny and good toy for our daughter. Now she can play with his brother Lego duplo bricks and make a new Dora tale.
1,OUCH!!,"If you think that torture might help you to sleep, then by all means buy one of these.CONS: It’s very painful, loud and the directions were written by someone with a limited grasp on the English languagePROS: the ability to return it"
2,Another Soap Opera,"This tale of four generations is a thinly disguised soap opera, with the requisite sex, money, emotional baggage and inter-generational misunderstandings. The characterization was dull and lackluster (until the really steamy parts) and the whole book was more than a bit of a stretch. None of the characters was particularly believable, interesting or sympathethic. I knew a couple chapters into the book that it wasn't for me, but I stuck with it and noticed a lot of sloppy editing toward the end. So glad I got my copy from the library, I am very surprised this book came out in hard cover. Definitely paperback material."
2,Second Silence,"I have read all of Eileen Goudge's books and have always waited anxiously for the next one to be available, however, I have to say that ""Second Silence"" was my least favorite. I did not feel the attachment to the characters that I have in her earlier books and did not find this book as hard to put down. I am not suggesting that the book was bad, but it was not of the same caliber as her previous books."
2,Not her best by any means,"I was so elated when I discovered Eileen Goudge. After reading about 7 of her books, and recommending her to my friends, I was so disappointed reading this book. It was so hard to follow the story line."
3,"an average, yet enjoyable read","This novel is about relationships. There is intrigue involved, but like all of Eileen Goudge's novels that I have read, the main theme is how different individuals relate to each other. The plot line does at times seem contrived, but often real life seems contrived when an unbelievable sociopath is involved. The author is a gifted writer and the book makes for an enjoyable read despite lacking any great points."
3,Fifth volume of the series,"All of BUENA VISTA's ""Cartoon Capers"" videotapes clock in at under a half hour, with only three animated shorts per edition. The first in this set is Max F. without his studio, the second comes from PARAMOUNT's Famous cartoon division and the last is a FLEISCHER company classic.This fifth edition in the series (subtitled ""Wacky Winter Wonderland"") features:RUDOLPH, THE RED NOSED REINDEER (1944) - Rare post-Fleischer Studios short directed by Max F. himself tells the famous holiday story in verse.THE SKI'S THE LIMIT (1949) - Swiss-cheesy singalong features yodeling clocks, holey cheese and a Jimmy Durante caricature.PEEPING PENGUINS (1937) - Four little penguins ignore their mom and explore a hunting cabin, where they find trouble.RELATED ITEM:CARTOON CAPERS, VOL. 6includes these animations: ""A Car-Tune Portrait,"" ""King for a Day"" and ""Little Lambkins."""
5,Real. Texas. Music,"Dub Miller is the real deal. True, from the heart, Texas music. There are no songs on this cd that are there because the managers said to put them there. Like Dub said at one show, ""This is your average Nashville country song. It's about a one-armed weed farmer."""
1,"If you enjoy taking chances, you'll love this drive!","Just like the other reviewers, my hard drive stopped working after 15 months of use. I couldn't get any of my data off it (there go all my files!) and Western Digital could do nothing but refer me to some unaffordable data recovery service. In all fairness, while it worked it was great! But - I think it's awfully convenient that the drives seem to die a couple months after the warranty expires."
1,Another Western Digital Drive Bites the Dust,My drive failed after 18 months with the same clicking noise that others experienced. I won't buy another WD drive.
1,Piece of junk,"The thing died during my second attempt to use it. No warning, no error messages, just complete system failure. Recommend you look at LaCie Brick USB drives instead."
2,"""C-"" at best","I bought this DVD thinking it was a good idea. I planned on playing it at our family party this past Christmas, which I did, but it didn't have the effect I was hoping for. First off, the music is not very cheerful sounding (manly choir sounding) like you are in church or something. Second, I thought it would be an hour of lights, but they used at least 20 minutes or so of filler footage of these weird looking winter ""paintings"" or postcards or something, and what lights footage they did use, was very amateurish and they re-used throughout the program. There wasn't anything else like it...so I said ""eh!. Good idea...but, poorly executed. Probably want to stay away from this one."
4,really liked this,"sweet and tradtional, artistic and thoughtful. REally liked this, I dont mind a lack of ""slickness"" to some of it, it's a nice Christmas piece, would reccomend for sure."
5,Great deal.,We have been very pleased with these coolers. They have withheld a lot of wear and tear as well and carry 6 packs of cans with ice without a problem.
2,Disappointing and returned!,"The inner workings of this machine work well. The case is very cheaply made. The battery door is very flimsy, as is the hinge mechanism for the main lid. Unless one takes extra care with this, something will be broken soon. This manufacturer let Amazon down."
4,Works Great,"i am using this player from 2 months and i dont have any problems with it.it just works and the coolest part is it comes with car kit,its of great use if you dont have a dash board CD player.The only down side is the Max volume is not that much high.i hope this review is helpful to you."
3,its no good,i bought it and returned it the same day.as soon as i removed it from the package.i powered it up i put a cd in it played perfect.the problem began when i used a blue layered discrecorded with mp3 files.the disc didnt play at all.so i returned it the same day.rca players stink.only sonys cd players are rugged.for everydayuse also sonys discman players donnot care about blue layered discs.it plays all discs.
1,TERRIBLE!!! DO NOT BUY!!!,"I bought this CD player over the summer, and in a matter of a few weeks, it skipped horribly. I took it back and exchanged it for another player of the same model. Sure enough, it skipped too. Now, it won't even play, and I'm stuck with a bum CD player and short $50. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
4,Smartrax trouble and... How do I recharge the batteries??,"Hi, I bought this discman.. I think it's great, it plays all my mp3's and wma's, it's easy to use and has a veeeery good antiskip protection... but... I have two questions:1.- Is there any way to use the Smartrax function without burning the cd's with MusicMatch?? I think it's kinda annoying... Can I use that function if I burn them with Nero?? Or.. do you know any other program that burns cd's and writes the MultiAudio Tracklist (MAU... That's what you need to use the Smartrax...)2.- How do I recharge the batteries?? What kind of AC Adaptor do I have to buy??? I don't know.. And... what does PDP2060U mean??Please help me!!!! I would aprecciate it!!"
2,Skippy,I'm ready to throw mine through the window! Sometimes it worked ok and sometimes not.. now it skips all the time. I can't find my receipt or the software so now I'm out $.
1,No resume after all,"I bought this cd player specifically because it was listed as having the ""resume"" feature. This feature only works if you are using MP3s NOT if you're using CDs.The player itself seems really nice and I'm sure that it's great for what it is - it's just not what I wanted and not quite what it says that it is in the specs!"
3,Good video - not great,"I have always thought Troy Stetina is one of the best teachers so his 80 licks are excellent. Greg Harrison's 80 licks are a waste, why use a nine string guitar for six string licks, assinine! I know the tabs are on the screen, but written tabs would be so much better"
2,Pts Guide,"This is an exhaustive list of web sites and links, many of which are not viable because they link to university sites that are not being managed or that have removed the target documents."
3,Pick A Card,"Overall its a good movie, however I bought it to practice my Hebrew, not to watch a quirky foreign film. The characters are well developed, and the acting is good, but the plot is a bit wishy-washy. They speak (Hebrew) very fast, and could only be understood completely by a native Israeli. It is a good look into the life of a poor couple that moved from the small farming town of Afula to Tel-Aviv. The main characters are an auto mechanic who tries to follow his dream to be a magician, and his longtime girlfriend who gets fed up with his failure. He finally hits it big as a slapstick sidekick to his mentor. The ending is good, but at times I was wondering if someone had accidentally taped over parts of the movie. The director cuts to ""news"" footage of residents of Afula speaking about their hometown son who is now famous. Overall I give it a B. It would probably get a borderline PG-13/R rating here in the states."
4,Readers' comments...,"Readers comment on The Day of the Nefilim:""...this is excellent full-on fantasy SF that incorporates current parallels and a unique and engrossing universe. An interesting blend of 2D and 3D characters and an interesting `life in the interior' scenario. When's the movie coming?"" - R.S.""I've read a lot of SF and conspiracy theories in my time, watched thousands of SF movies and documentaries, but I've never come across anything like this!"" - E.V.""It ranks, in my mind, with L. Ron Hubbard's Battlefield Earth. Would be a great movie. Please continue."" - L.G.""Oh my. I almost quit work to finish this. I got lost in the awesome surrealism of this novel. When I started reading, I couldn't put it down."" - L.W.""Great story! One of the most original I've read in a long time! Brilliant use of characters and current events. I couldn't put it down."" - M.F.""It's an odd book."" - D.S.""Okay, okay. That was cooooool."" - M.P."
2,Do not expect S-video,"I bought this player expecting to connect the S-video at times to my home system.Firstly, the S-video connection is completely non-standard.Secondly, the company does not provide, nor to buy, an appropriate s-video connector.Instead, the technical support refers you to *buy* an adapter (that is actually a converter) from Radio Shack that supposedly converts s-video to composite. That it does, therefore losing any value from the S-video since the separate signals are coarsely combined by the converter. In fact, the s-video done with this adapter is far worse than just the regular composite output!For all intents and purposes, this DVD player provides NO useable s-video signal! If you expect to use this feature, avoid this player.Otherwise, the display is merely adequate, and not as good as other DVD portables in this low-end price range."
3,"Good, but not good enough","I have read all the previous rewiews from others, and decided to get one. It is, indeed, a good DVD player for the price. But my DVD player quits playing after the first week with my 3 year-old daughter. It is a good enough DVD player that I decided to send back to Amazon for a replacement."
4,Followup review,"This is a followup review afterr about a month of extensive travel, including 15,000 miles air, 2000 miles car, and 1000 miles AMTRAK,.The top is made of some metal and dents very easily., even when kept in a case.The whole unit is somewhat slippery.The battery does not last through a whole movie, which means 90 minutes, even when screen and volume are low.The low battery warning flashing on the screen is annoying.Two people can plug in headphones at one time, one using the audio out jack.Other than the above comments, considering the price I would recommend it. It ran fine and as expected except for the battery short life. The picture quality is pretty good."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!!!!!,"I purchased this model on 12/21/03 and it started to black out on me in May. After getting some tips from Customer Service it was working again but I had to reprogram it on a regular basis; any DVD over 30 mins would make the screen go black. This is a frustrating process when you have a 5 yr old yelling ""Daddy the screen is black"".When I called Customer Service back earlier this month they told me they have a warranty extended plan where you send the model back with $49.00 and they will replace it with a new one. It sounded great but why would I spend more money on a product that doesn't work well? I went ahead and ordered the Panasonic LS50 7"" Portable DVD Player instead and it's like night and day. This DVD has features the Initial product doesn't have like QUALITY! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product, go for quality and get the Panasonic."
1,Junk!,I purchased this item from WalMart and it worked for one movie and now we get a few seconds of viewing and then the black screen. It was over 30 days before we initially used it and so now WalMart is not willing to exchange or refund. I see I am not the only one with this problem so I would HIGHLY reccommend buying a more reputable brand DVD player. You get what you pay for and this one is junk!
4,Great Value,This portable DVD player is a great value. It works great. I have tested with DVD+R and it would not play DVD+R discs...great player anyway. Worked wonders while travelling across Europe with my 5 year old.
2,Horrible Battery Life,"I got this specifically for a long plane trip. I was unpleasantly surprised when the battery died a quarter of the way through the second movie. I wasn't watching ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Titanic"", just normal movies.Without the option of running it on normal batteries instead of the included battery pack, I can't reccomend this DVD player for travel.However, if you're taking it for car rides, it does come with the car adapter. I never took advantage of it, but I can only assume this would negate the battery problem (assuming you have an extra plug for it in the car)."
2,A DVD player with a VCD quality LCD screen or less,"I you want to watch VCD, this player may be good enough. But if you want to watch a DVD, don't expect this player will provide a high quality video. I wonder what is the resolution of the screen on this player. It is a very poor quality screen in term of the resolution."
1,Reliability issue,"I ordered this player to entertain my 2 year old on a 6 hour plane flight. It arrived just on time for the trip, but did not work at all. When the player was turned on, the screen would stay on for less than 1 second and then shut off. That was it -- totally un-usable. Needless to say I am returning it, and had to manage the trip without it."
4,Great Price - Great Player,"I love this unit! Other review sites have reviews that say this player doesn't play widescreen DVDs correctly. That is because the factory setting for the display is incorrect. You have to go into the SETUP menu from the remote and set the display mode to WIDE (instead of Normal LB, the factory default). No idea why they would send a 16x9 player out set to normal instead of wide, but they did (duh!).Plays everything I have thrown at it. VCD, SVCD, CDR, DVD+RW, regular DVDs, anamorphic DVDs, widescreen DVDs. Sound is loud enough to hear on the road as well.I wish they would put FF and RW on the unit, though. You have to use the remote.Very clear screen, viewable from pretty wide angles.Highly recommend."
3,Good if you will watch entire movie in one sitting,"This player is good. The only problem I have is it doesn't remember where you left off. If you are like any other busy person, you use the player because it's portable and want to watch a movie when you can, in small increments, such as on your lunch break or waiting for a flight. The problem with the player is, once you shut it off...it forgets where you left off. This gets annoying when the nearest chapter in your movie is far from where you left off. Fast forwarding is your only solution. The bookmark ""feature"" is worthless because the unit forgets them once you shut it down. What a pain!!!!"
2,7 inch model freezes up,"I bought the 7"" model and it froze up. You thump it and it goes. I exchanged it and the second one does the same thing after 3 or 4 movies. It looks like someone else had the same problem with the 7"" model, but everyone who bought the 8"" model does not have this problem. Could there be a design flaw in the 7"" model? Other than that, it's a great value, but that is a major problem. I would consider trading up to the 8"" if I thought it would not freeze up. Any input anyone has on this would be appreciated."
1,garbage,"Amazing to look back at the garbage that was written and eaten up by paranoid US management. Life time employment, company loyalty , and payment based on tenure are the exact things that have undone the Japanese companies. Sorry Bill but you should have picked a letter earlier in the alphabet."
5,andis clipper operation,"i am very satisified with this product,i can change blades quickly and have the power to cut wet hair,i use it professionally and as a teaching method.the design is comfortable in the hand."
5,Great Clippers,"I was a little hesitant at first since I had never heard of this brand. I'm glad I went with it however, because it it the best set of clippers that I have ever owned. Likely the last set of clippers that I will ever buy"
1,Piece of crap,"Andis 22315BGC2 Excel 2-Speed Professional ClipperPurchased March 2011. My husband and I cut each others' hair- after going through many cheap clippers we decided to spring for a ""top of the line"" clippers. Reviews were favorable, but after 6 months of use (haircuts every 6 weeks) it began to pull and cut unevenly. No amount of adjustment would fix this problem."
1,Sweet Savage Eden,Reading this book was a waste of time. The plot was unbelievable and the main characters had no depth. Save your money.
1,Huge Disappointment,Reading this book was a waste of time. The plot was unbelievable and the main characters had no depth. Save your money.
3,Sweet Savage Eden,"I had a hard time rating this. I could not decide between a 2 and a 3. The story had great potential, but did not like the characters, especially Jassy. She is just a spoiled witch. There is not really anything to indicate any real relationship between Jassy and Jamie. He is not necessarily a great guy either for a hero. I have read it twice as the first time was so many years ago I forgot I did not really like it. It is not horrible though either. The two main characters are just not what I like to see in a book. I see a lot of people liked it. I however know she has written a lot better books and other than a few of her books(Graham Family series) that have too much history that make them some what boring, this is one of the books I avoid re-reading. The other is Devil's Mistress. I just did not really care for that one either."
3,Works maybe? Need better directions!,"I've tried using the strips 6 times as the directions said (2 strips each of the 6 times), but I only got results a couple of times, which seemed to be the times that the wax got solid.But how long do we leave it on for the wax to get solid?!Once when it worked I had had them on for ~1minThe other time ~20minYet the other times I tried ~20 sec, ~5in, ~10min & ~30min and it didn't work/get solid. This is very confusing, how long should it be left on, how can you try to help make it more solid???"
1,A bottle of honey and scotch tape = this product,"Got these thinking they were a simple solution, well I was wrong.The wax is a very sticky caramel-like goo which requires a lot of work to get a couple hairs to come off.The end is result is all the hair is still on your body and you now have all this caramel like goo stuck to it, and no regular soap will not get it off.You'll be better off with Nair which at least works a little or just using a razor."
2,Packing tape may work better,Glue everywhere. Hair still in place. The good thing is that the glue washes off fairly well with warm water and soap. Electric clippers do a better job for me.
4,Great Source!!,"Entertainment Weekly's guide to Seinfeld can be suprisenly useful. It gives defintions of everything on the show, including a episode guide of the show's ealier years."
1,unsatisfied with book not being NEW!!,"This book was suppose to be new but came in with check marks in it and pink highlights. I would think twice before ordering anything from country boy ever again. The book itself has good information, just upset it was not new like promised."
5,Love it!,I was looking for a small pot--this fit the bill. The strainer lid is a bonus. It has a nice weight. Great bargain.
1,wrong item pictured,"This item was listed by Amazon as a Non-stick saucepan. After I received it, I realized it was a regular saucepan. Just to make sure, I called the company that makes it and they confirmed this. Wearever said that all of their Non-stick saucepans are coated on the inside and have red enamel on the outside."
4,Good value Good little sauce pan,"This is a nice little stainless pan. It looks good; it conducts heat well.It has one drawback. The lid handle gets too hot when boiling anything. Solution: get a small nylon washer to put between handle and lid.It has one quirk. When the lid cools off, you sometimes hear a little chirp."
5,WearEver Cook n Strain Sauce Pan,"I love my pan. Easy to clean, cooks evenly, looks professional. Comfortable weight. The straining feature is a win, win!"
1,Lid and Handle become VERY hot!!,Beware of the temperature of the lid and handles. This does not give sufficient protection of temperature and you might get burned like me.
5,Great Saucepan!,I've added this saucepan along with the 3 quart pan to complete my set of this pour and strain cookware. After many years of nonstick pans I wanted something that would last. Even though the frypan in this line is nonstick it is ok with me. These pans are well made and I will enjoy cooking with them for many years to come and look forward to adding more stainless steel to my collection as I go.
2,Not the best feeling.,"I chose this product because it seemed to combine both of the qualities I wanted in a personal lubricant, the silkiness of silicone and the warming feature usually found in the sticky gel stuff you buy at the drug store. I was dissapointed. This stuff uses mint as a warming element, and is sticky and 'unsilicone' like. I'm not a fan."
4,Remote control,Great picture all functions. Did have problem with VCR when first used (Ate tape). Could have been due to excessive moisture. OK after one day idle. Biggest problem is practically illegable print identifying control buttons on remote. In most cases have to turn lite on to read functions due to poor contrast between case color & print.
3,It is what is says it is...,"Simply an index of accidents around the world. Not much in the way of background information, but if you're trying to find the date a IL-76 crashed in Siberia in 1982, it's probably in there."
3,Slippery when wet!,"This bath doesn't fit in a standard sink. Needs a wash basin. And there is no head support, so you have to keep one hand on your infant until they have head control. Hard to wash their bum, too. And the between the legs thing is pinchy if you have a boy- you need to position them just so so you don't squish their bits. Small and easier to store than the huge tubs with the infant nets, though."
5,love love!,"I disagree with the review which says this doesn't work well for newborns. It works great for ours! We love it! And now that she's a month, it supports her really well and she loves having her feet in the water and being able to splash around. I love how it cradles her and I feel she's very safe. Its a great bath seat!!"
2,Doesn't fit,"Bought the PRI based on great reviews and price. It arrived very quickly (next day, using Amazon Prime). Ufortunately, it doest fit in my standard kitchen sink or bathroom vanities. In fact, the PRI does not even come close to fitting. I wouldnt recommend this for bathing in standard sinks. However, I plan to use it in the bathtub to bathe my newborn alongside my 2 year old. I like that it is shaped in a way that will keep the baby from slipping and I think it will be fine for bathing the 2 kids together, though my 2 year old will have to get used to bathing in shallower water since the PRI sits very low!"
4,Simiple- easy to use!,"I used this in both my sink and in the bath tub until my daughter was able to sit up on her own. I loved it! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because you have to have a fairly good sized sink to use it in the sink. My daughter was able to push herself upwards with her feet on the side of the sink and I worried about her hurting her crotch area coming down on the rise in the seat. She never did, but it is something I paid attention to. Will be using this seat for the rest of my children as well!"
3,"Nice tub, but not great for newborn.","I like this tub, but I don't think it is the best option for a newborn. I like it better between 3-6 months of age. The plastic is quite hard, so you have to line it with wash cloths to make it softer. As soon as my son is able to sit up on his own, I won't be using it. As I said earlier, I like it best for ages 3-6 months, so I ended up getting a different tub for when he was first born. I just felt like he wasn't as secure in this tub as in others I have tried. It was hard to wash his back in the tub before he had head control. I also feel like this is better for a little girl as the male anatomy gets in the way when they straddle it."
3,Good size but baby gets cold,"it is nice for newborns but the baby gets cold much easier. you could fill up the tub a little but then you also want to drain the dirty water somewhere so it becomes a hassle, easier to have a smaller tub in the big bath tub."
5,Exactly what I needed,"I am so glad I came across this product on Amazon! I have been searching for a good bath solution, and didn't want to buy a whole baby bath tub because my bathrooms are small. This works perfectly for me. My baby is 7 weeks and he doesn't seem to slip around in the seat and seems very comfortable. It fits in my kitchen sink, and I consider my sink small. I am happy and at a great price!"
5,finally found a great infant bath helper!,"So, finally after baby number two arrived I found this lifesaver. I had tried numerous baby baths the first go around--the ones with fabric slings, the ones with battery operated showers and the ones with special contours, etc. I was always grossed out by the fabric slings not seeming to be clean. The shower ones were pieces of garbage. So, the end result was to use an inexpensive plastic tub with a flat bottom and insert the Primo infant bath seat. I would put a hand towel down on the seat to make it softer for my baby. The seat supported her great and the towel got thrown in the laundry after each bath. Easily cleanable. Wish I had found this for the first baby too! After she was able to sit up, I took out the Primo seat and used the inexpesive baby bath until she was old enough to go in the big bathtub. Worked Fabulously!"
2,Not necessarily a great fit,"Too unsteady in my oval bathroom sinks -- the nice suction cup bottoms couldn't touch the base of the sink. Too long for my wide metal kitchen sink, even diagonally (baby's feet would bang against the metal sides). And no good means to get a small infant to be secure at the base and still be protected at the head and neck -- Note that all the photos have babies in the later range -- 3+ months. This is just not a good infant tub for young (0-3 mo) infants."
2,Not big enough for my 5 month old baby.,"This was delivered to me yesterday. I returned it right away. It's a little too small for my baby. My baby is a bit long and he's only 5 months old. Looks like a good product though. Yeah, the plastic is flimsy. It would probably be good if I bought this from a garage sale for 5 buck. I would pay for 5 bucks for this."
3,it's just ok!,Ordered this for my now 3 mnths old. The seat is pretty big so unless you have a large sink or another tub it has to go on the bath tub. Makes it hard with newborn.
3,Great for people who already have a basin,"We got this bath seat when our daughter was 4 months old. We used the Puj tub from birth until 4 months, but she was too big so we were looking for another seat. This seat didn't fit into our sinks so we put it in the tub. It worked well there, but we had to fill up the tub with a lot of water to use it, so we decided to look for another tub. We got thePRI EuroBath, Pearl White, and that is perfect. For people who already have a basin or a big sink, this seat is a more affordable option, but the EuroBath can be used for much longer than this seat and it saves water!"
5,Absolutely the best baby bath seat/tub!,"I wish I has this for my first child. I used to dread bathing my first born, it was always a screaming session. I normally never give reviews, but love this simple seat so much, I have to share! This bath seat is beautifully designed to make baby feel secure. From day one my baby has enjoyed bathing in this. No slipping and moving around at all, no need to hold on to her with one hand like in a regular baby tub. Bath time is the happiest and most relaxing time for mom and baby! And so easy to store in my Manhattan apt. Sad that she will outgrow it soon."
1,Doesn't fit,We have a pretty large sink in our laundry room and the bath tub didn't fit in it. It says it fits most sinks and bath tubs. We should have measured first! Back it went!!! The bad thing is that you have to return it to giggle...they require their returns to be insured!!! That was an extra cost and a pain but I got my money back fairly quickly...
1,Horrible bathtub.....,"This seat was purchased because of the positive reviews and my budget. We couldn't buy a bathtub that cost a small fortune but this one is so cheap it should pay me money to take it off the manufacturers hands. My daughter hates her baths and I had to hold her up the entire time. Also, the second time I used it, the suction cup on the back leg broke off and I couldn't even get it back on. So much for getting any use out of this seat. I can't find my receipt or else it would be returned. Don't buy this product."
5,Perfect for my one month old girl,"I love this bath seat, it's the perfect size for my baby, it keeps her in place and allows me to bath her easily."
4,Very Handy!,"Nice contour, makes giving our 2 month old a bath do-able by yourself. Need to warm up the plastic surface or cover with a warmed towel to keep her from slipping down while giving a bath, but she seems to enjoy it and it props her up nicely. Better than a simple ramp, which we used for our first. Would give it 5 stars if somehow it could be softer or non-slip on the surface where you set the baby. Definitely would buy again if another was needed."
4,Great re-printing of a neglected play!,"Oscar Wilde's SALOME is perfect for the phrase ""neglected masterpiece"". It is exciting and gorgeously written. There is also a constant feeling of vitality. We are thrown into the middle of a tense situation and (despite the jewel-like language) no time is wasted in getting to the tragic conclusion. Perhaps the only flaw is the lack of well drawn characters but this is rarely felt due to the beauty and strength of Wilde's writing. Many would find SALOME anti-Christian. This wouldn't bother me at all but if you read carefully you'll notice all the offensive elements are in the pagan characters. John the Baptist stays virtuous. I'd love to see a good performance. Aubrey Beardsley's UNDER THE HILL is interesting but never very memorable. The illustrations are great but I'm not sure they are all in the right place. This book is a must have for all lovers of aestheticism and SALOME should be read by all."
5,Exposing The World Of The Occult,"Extremely helpful to me soon after leaving the satanic world of the occult, and giving my life to Jesus in 1974. If your background included dabbling in the paranormal or new age; then this book is for you. Helps unveil what God really has to say about it."
5,wow,"Excellent stuff...It's been in my rotation for weeks...some real dance tunes and a wonderful eclectic mix. Better than PF02...PF01 and PF03 are my favorites out of the Trust the Dj series...These are like the Gilles Petersen series, but more uptempo. Don't hesitate, pick one up."
5,"SWEET!!!! Well, not really!!!",I just happened to check and they were in stock!!! They had previously been sold out. Recommendation to Amazon....Set up email alerts to notify consumers when out of stock items come available. :-)
3,Buying Guide needs to guide some more,"I have always been a big fan of the Buying Guide, but the 2007 version seems to be lacking in several critical reviews for household products. Next time I will probably just go to the library to look up the articles themselves."
5,"Great Product, Great idea","This is a perfect product for me. I have 400+ dvds and they are all scattered around in 32 -72 pack cases. With a 300Gb HD and some patience I've copied most of the movies we regularly watch over for easy access as well as my music.It works as advertised. The remote could be a little bigger/ergodynamic, but you get used to it quickly. Very satisfied and recommend it enough that I bought my parents one and have talked several others into buying with positive reviews from them as well."
1,terrible,THE SECTION ON GERMANY WAS DISGUSTING.THE CZECH REPUBLIC NOT DISGUSTING JUST VERY POORLY DONE.
3,matt,Very informative on all of the porsche models listed in the book. The book did lack in pictures and history on the 550 and 550a models. Not your best choice if you are looking for 550 information.
4,Good Big Band Collection,"Not one of my favorite CD'-some of the music selections are too much alike; the songs could have been arranged better to provide more variety. On the other hand; some real ""classics"" you don't hear very often. Not a bad CD-just not great!"
3,"BIIM Back, But Slacking","this is probably the best song on the whole Nate, Mike, Shawn, Wanya album, but it is still nothing compared to the material on their sophomore LP, II. ""On Bended Knee"" and ""I'll Make Love to You"" can never be imitated. though this is the same group singing it, ""thank you in advance"" lacks the once rich, energy filled vocals that it could have possessed. maybe it has something to do with britney, n' sync competition, or the music industry falling apart from napster, but it is not a good thing."
2,poor screen quality,The size is right for this DVD however the screen quality is much to be desired. However it plays ok when connecting it to a regular tv. So if you want something small to port around it is ok. Better off putting your money towards a PC with a dvd drive in it. To me its not worth [money amount]dollars as the screen is too small and the quality of the screen isn't that great
2,Poor manufacturing,"I bought this product almost 1 year ago. It was doing a great job for the first 6 months then I started having problems. I found out that you can not extend the car adapter to the back seat without it messing up the connection. However, that is why I bought it. I think it would be against the law for me to watch TV while I was driving. My kids sit in the back seat and they are the ones going to watch it. Initial needs to state this on their box if it is not intended for that use. It is a good DVD to hook up stationary to the TV but for portable use the battery back is a pain to keep attached. I would reccommend spending your money on a better brand. But research it!"
5,"If you need a portable image device, this is it!!","I have to show to my clients the designs of their future homes, in other words their virtual homes and it was kind of complicated for me sometimes, because most of them did not have a dvd player in their office or even at home. Now with this amazing device, I will be able to show the projects and go anywhere I want, even I can go to the future working site and show them how the future home it is going to be built. This is amazing!!!! And the price..... wow..... what a bargain!!!!"
1,Disappointing,"Try a more popular brand with accessories that can be easily replaced from your local electronic store. Their accessories fail frequently and are expensive to replace through the company, yet the company is the only place to purchase them. I really rate this ""0"" stars!!"
1,Frustrating and not worth the money.,"I bought this less than a year ago and I've been trying to take it back ever since. I've sent several e-mail messages to the manufacturer and they have never responded. I've also sent Wal-Mart.com several e-mail messages and they won't respond either. This unit overheats within an hour of play. It won't play some DVDs at all. It quits playing if you even touch it, then you have to start it up again and find where the movie left off. It freezes at times and you have to start the movie over again. It's terrible to take in a car with you, which is why I bought it in the first place. You spend more time fighting the thing than watching it. The screen is also hard to see, especially if you're in the back seat. My kids complain that it's too dark, even at the lightest setting. I wouldn't recommend it. Save your money and get a nice, working player."
2,Not very robust,"I purchased this DVD player at Walmart... Almost immediately it began to fail. The DVD would play, but the backlight on the TFT display would fail to illuminate the screen. If you would tap the display it would come back, but only for a few minutes. I do not recommend this product dispite the price. You will only need to immediately return it or purchase another one"
5,Classic review,"Marvelous haiku summaries for lovers of haiku, the classics, or Shrinklits. A great gift book, but keep one for yourself."
1,canceled request ... seemingly permanently out of stock.,Would have like to have purchased this item but it's been 'out of stock' now for 3 months. I just canceled the order/request. Then I'm asked to rate something I never received.
5,Hard cover or soft cover who knows?,"This is an excellent book, but just to warn you. There are bothhard cover and soft cover versions which are quite different. I ordered this book expecting the hardcover without being aware the softcover existed. And I don't see any clue from Amazon's website as to how I should have known otherwise? Be careful to order the version you want!"
3,Excessively dry,"I am not a big fan of this recording. I applaud the effort of original instruments, but it gets in the way of the enjoyment here, the sound is just too thin for my taste. The recording quality doesn't help - to my ears, it sounds tinny and dry. I like the Elatus release of the recording by Il Giardino Armenico much better - it has a much fuller, richer sound."
4,Great little system,"I bought the RCA compact system to be my system in the basement and at first I wondered if it would be powerful enough? But at 100 watts it is indeed powerful enough. I like how the CD magazine style is very easy to operate. The tape deck is very easy as well. The only draw back is that I worry I might lose the remote which is small, all well I hope that never happens. My advice go out and buy this system you won't regret it."
1,Do Not buy it,"Although the price is very attractive, it is really worth what you are paying, or even less. Discs always get stucked and once you get tired of taking it to a Radio Shack store to get it fixed, it goes to the bin."
2,Not what I had expected...,I ordered these expecting them to be like other honey wheat pretzels but they are not. There is something about the flavor that is not thrilling me but now I have a whole case. I think I might just donate the rest of the bags.
5,I love these,"These are so yummy. My son likes the Oat Bran, hubby likes the Honey Wheat and I love the Pumpernickel & Onion. It makes me happy to find an incredible ingredient list for something so yummy. Amazon has the best price if you want to buy in bulk."
4,My favorite pretzel,These are my favorite pretzels. I like the whole-wheat flavor and rough grain texture. They are also a good size for snacking. I can never find these in the store so I buy them online. I have bought several cases and had one off-flavor/stale bag.
2,Basic and simplistic,"This is a scratch-the-surface course, which contains a lot of the same vocabulary and materials as the Beginning course just expanded. It is obvious that the writer is not a language instructor and the course was not put together in a clear graded manner. The writer also seems to enjoy filling the CDs with his own ten-cents of this and that (just like in the intro course), which is irrelevant to the learning of the language. But all said and done, beggars can't be choosers, this is the best ""course"" available that will take you a bit further into the language and you get more recorded speech to practice with. Just don't get your hopes too high!"
4,7.1 wall speaker plate,"Among the 5 plates for component connections I purchased, this Atlona plate was the highest quality. The screw threads were finely machined, gold plating seems to be applied properly and the backing material (plastic) was thick and sturdy. While I have not installed the components yet, this products seems to be up to HiFi standards. Likely, I will return the other brands- they are all inferior to the Atlona product."
2,Does the trick but not very slick,"It works for a small dry pouch for money, ID and credit cards. It's not big enough to fit a wallet or a cell phone in, which bums me out as that was one of the reasons I got it.The top yellow plastic thing is also really thick and has 2 rotating ""screws"" that tighten the seal shut. The thickness of this part is also kind of annoying. Finally, I had a real hard time getting the cardboard that came inside the pouch out, since it was stuck to the rubber/plastic of the actual pouch, and I had to finess it quite a bit to get it out without damaging the pouch.I probably would not buy this if I had seen it in a store."
3,Really bulky clasp design,"So I'm hopeful that it will work well, but the clasp design is incredibly bulky for a pouch this size. The plastic is about 1/2"" wide. I'm thinking about sending it back just because of that, but likely won't because the return shipping from Alaska will be as much as the refund."
2,Leaks a little,Don't trust this item. Used to hold our car key and money... would get damp inside. Ended up using a zip-lock baggy inside of it to prevent items from getting wet.
1,Packaging Problem,Tthe cardboard packing that comes with it is almost impossible to get out without destroying the product. Will send this baby back.
1,Not completely watertight and too small,"I ordered 2 of these based on a large number of glowing reviews when I could not find the hard shell water safes that we used on our last snorkeling trip. Although the price was certainly right, the wallets proved to be too small for anything but a room card, a credit card and a small amount of cash. Could not even come close to fitting my iPhone. And that turned out to be a good thing because both of ours leaked. Not a lot, but enough so that a phone or camera would probably have been destroyed. It is possible that I accidentally tore both of them when removing the cardboard packing material but I don't think so, having been warned by previous reviews. I think that while these might be OK for money and credit cards for water parks and boat rides, that they are not water tight enough for prolonged submersion as in snorkeling and diving.JMT"
4,"Small and compact, but keeps the valuables dry.","Took it on a trip down the Potomac River, placed in swimsuit pocket. We started on tubes, but were knocked overboard in the rapids. Swam for a while, completely submerging the wallet. After four hours money and driver's license within were completely dry; not even the slightest bit of water or condensation within.As a previous comment mentioned, use care when removing the cardboard packing liner that the wallet ships with."
1,NOT a passport protector,"I bought this for a cruise, to keep my passport dry. A passport does not fit in this thing. Grrr."
1,"Do NOT waste your money. If you could see the product first, you would not buy it",I bought 4 of these things to use as stocking stuffers. But when I actually received these items I was embarrssed to give them as gifts. Waste of money. The yellow section at the top is actually quite thick and hard. It does not bend at all. The pouch is small and flat. I consider this a totally useless item from China. How/why anyone would wear this thing around their neck or inside their swim or paddling trunks is beyond me. Save your money--don't buy this product.
4,Passport won't fit in this.,"Passport won't fit in this. I know that's the one thing I couldn't find out in other reviews. Product works, looks cool, and doesn't cost much."
4,Helpful but kind of clunky,"This wallet is big enough to hold cash and credit cards while you're at the beach, and it keeps everything mostly dry. Some of our cash was a little damp after we took the wallet into the water. The wallet's closure -- the yellow plastic top and black clips -- was a bit clunky. Sometimes the black clips could be difficult to open and close, but I guess that's the point. My boyfriend was able to fit the wallet in the pocket of his board shorts, but as a girl, I have nowhere to put this while I'm out swimming. I guess you could wear it around your neck with the lanyard, but it would be kind of hideous, and it'd also advertise all the cash you're carrying."
5,Kwik Tek Dry Wallet,Awesome - works as advertisedI was skeptical to whether this would work over a long period of time. We took it to one of the Disney water parks for the whole day and everything was perfectly dry.
5,Perfect!,"Kept everything dry, used in Jamiaca during th elong climb up Dunn River Falls! I was the only one with one and the only with dry money at the end!"
5,Kwik Tek Wallet,"Bought six of these, because I thought they were cheap and wouldn't last. Boy was I mistaken. I've used this to hold my debit, hotel, ID, and car key while diving. Only once did I find a drop of water after 14 dives, as deep as 130 ft. I kept it in my shorts pocket and have no doubts about it performance. They seel these in the dive shop for $20.00 each. I bought all 6 of mine for less than that. I did read the reviews before I bought these, and the people who suggested to soak the paper in water to get it out was the best idea. I understand why it's installed the way it is, to minimize damage while being stored. Works great, I've given a couple to friends, because they needed it, and it didn't cost me much."
4,"Convenient but not 100% watertight, money got damp","Used this wallet on a recent 4-day cruise in the Caribbean while swimming and snorkeling. Very convenient to bring ID, credit card, and cash, however I didn't find it to be 100% waterproof despite the seal. I noticed that my paper money would be a little damp at the end of the day - but not completely soaked, and it wasn't as if the whole wallet had completely filled with water. Since everything else in there was a plastic card, and merchants are still willing to accept wet money, it wasn't a huge issue. For $6 I can't really complain anyway, worth the investment since it beats using a Ziploc bag because of the lanyard. Just wouldn't put anything in the wallet that absolutely cannot get wet."
5,Nice little waterproof bag,"This does lock tightly, no water got in when I went snorkeling with credit cards and keys. I didn't take it deep, and I didn't risk anything like a phone. I am glad I read reviews- the insert it comes with is very hard to get out, and could have damaged it. Remember to fold it inside before trying to take out that insert!"
4,water proof neck wallet,"The product worked fine but it is a little small. It is too small for a passport or wallet. However it was just right for drivers license, credit cards and money. The size was perfect for the beach and wearing around your neck as a neck purse. The only bad thing is the card they put in it for shipping. It is impossible to remove it without carefully cutting it in half."
3,what others say is true,Ive only recently received this and its overall construction seems ok if you dont treat it too roughly and dont overstuff it. I agree with those who have complained that the inner cardboard to support its shipping shape is ridiculously tight and invites a teat mishap. This needs to be rethought. What I ended up doing was folding in the corners of the cardboards and then very gradually folding the side edges inward inch by inch until the cardboard was narrow enough to slide out. Took about 5 minutes which is uncalled for. Hopefully the item itself will be as strong as the packaging.
5,Great for use in and around wet environments.,I purchased this wallet to use on cruise vacations and it was so handy. I would leave my leather wallet in the room safe and carry my ID and cash in this on board ship and while on shore excursions. No worries about getting the contents wet under any circumstances.
1,very disappointed,"Just got this in the mail, excited to have it for our cruise. Tested it in a small bowl of water, and after only 1 hour, there was a small amount of water inside, and what looked like condensation throughout the entire inside. I did the 'squeeze it' test, and did everything according to the directions. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,great concept but not usable,"needed something to use while swimming to store room key and money. Unfortunately this is really flimsy and does not hold seal. Also, keeps hitting in the face while swimming. Used only once.............."
1,Does not work!,I ordered 2 of these for my trip to Cancun. On very first day I had my currency and credit cards soaked as It did not protect water seeping in. I thought issue was with one but other behaved the same. You can only use this as dry wallet:) A simplae sandwitch zip lock might work better.
1,Leaked Upon First Use,"Before going down to the beach I slipped my ID, room key, credit card and a Jackson inside the Kwik Tek Dry Pak Alligator Wallet, carefully sealed and locked the latches, then packed it into my swim trunks' pocket. We spent a couple hours playing in the water and when I opened it up to get back in my room I was greeted by a bag full of water. Thankfully the only casualty was a soggy bill, but a Ziploc sandwich bag would have worked better. I experimented with it over the following few days but it failed with similar results. Won't be using it again."
1,Does not keep items dry,"Saw good reviews for this product and ordered it. The first time we used it in water, it didn't worked. All of our important papers got soaked. Luckily, the people at our resort were forgiving!"
1,Not great,It broke the first day we used it. It is to small to put a passport in it. It would be nice that it was a little bigger.
4,Works great...but is small.,"Not big enough for most cell phones. Works great for rooms keys, cards, and cash."
1,Cheap Clips,"The two clips that rotate and seal the wallet are poorly designed, I broke both of the small ""teeth"" off one of the clips with very little force, while trying to close it. The thing is useless now."
4,great product!,"I purchased 2 wallets for our trip to Hawaii. It was wonderful!. We felt safe with our items secured to us. We were able to snorkel and swim and still have our ids, credit cards, and cash with us! They were perfectly water proof. Worked so well we gave the second one to the in-laws to replace their hard case water wallet."
3,not practical,"I bought this pouch to take on a hike (in case of rain or slips during one of our river crossings) to put mine and my boyfriends phone in. It was a squeeze to fit them (two iPhones) in the first time, but we managed it. On the second day however, there was a sickening snap as he attempted to latch the bag.The plastic snaps completely gave rendering the product entirely obsolete.If you are planning on using this pouch to hold one or two credit cards and maybe some cash you should be fine, but a phone and wallet are out of the question, or even two phones."
4,Does the Job,"It is what it's advertized as, a little dry pack. Kept things perfectly dry, especially handy if you're snorkeling or scuba diving and need to take a car key with you. If you've got the right frame, you can loop it around your waist vs. your neck and keep it out of the way. Even if not it would be easy enough to replace the strap or throw it into a BCD pocket.BUT a word of caution. I'd read on other reviews that they jam a piece of nearly impossible to remove cardboard. This unfortunately is 100% true. I really worried about tearing the plastic. I used a smaller pair of scissors to carefully reduce the size of the cardboard so I could slip it out, but good gracious do they make it hard! You'll feel like you're diffusing a bomb.Other than that great product!"
2,small,Extremely difficult to remove cardboard insert...sounds like this wouldn't be a big deal or keep you from ordering but it was very frustrating to get the cardboard piece out without ripping the plastic which would make the wallet useless. I have not used the wallet to see how it holds up in water because it is so small. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT WITH THE INTENT OF PUTTING A CELL PHONE OR ANYTHING OF SIZE OTHER THAN A CREDIT CARD OR MONEY...I had hoped to fit my cell phone but should have read the dimensions better.
5,Great traveling companion,"Totally waterproof, light weight and good looking pouch! I used it for my snorkeling excursions on the Caribbean cruise and loved it! This is perfect for carrying ship cards, credit cards, cash, etc. Can't find better value!"
2,"Pretty tiny, not waterproof","This pouch is just big enough for some credit cards and cash - not big enough for a passport. The instructions clearly say ""do not submerge"" so ""dry bag"" it isn't."
3,Works Reasonably - Not As Well Designed as Other Brands,"I purchase the 4""x4"" Dry-Pack. It works reasonably well provided the seals are kept free of sand etc.The design with a clamp is not as compact nor reliable as other packs I have which feature a ""roll-down"" style top. They are not as susceptible to dirt etc. in the sealing mechanism.In addition, the plastic used is not as rugged as others.I suggest you look around at other brands before making a decision."
4,Handy water pouch,Nice way to carry your credit cards and electronic car key so you don't need to leave valuables on the beach when you swim or snorkel. The knobs are abit awkward to tighten but once it is secure the pouch does keep everything dry. Make sure there is no sand in the seam or it will leak a tiny bit. Tested it down to 20ft while on a snuba trip.
4,okay but there are better options,"I've tried this while swimming and it doesn't hold much except for few cards and bills. The opening is narrow and easy for water to dribble in and out just from opening such and you have to be careful not to open it too wide to tear at the edges. It wasn't always as waterproof as I'd like but for the things I was carrying, but it didn't matter so much.The hard shell type waterproof cases do better (my favorite is the one that Eddie Bauer used to sell that also contained 'emergency' stuff inside, which I took out and used instead to put my cell phone in with credit card and money and just used the waterproof case) - unfortunately that case is hard to find now. and for bigger items, the Lewis and clark medium pouches have worked much better."
1,Leaks!,"I liked this product at first, good size and looked nice. We were very cautious when putting items in and taking them out, as to not rip or tear the plastic. However, when my husband swam with it on, all our money and items in it got soaked. It somehow leaked and he did have it securely shut. He had to dry all our money out on his legs on the bus ride home (we were in Mexico). I do not recommend this product."
3,It does the job!,"The pak does what it supposed to do. I was just a little disappointed since it was too small to hold my passport, other than that it keep my things dry and clean. Be careful when you receive the pak, since the cardboard insert is a little tricky to get out. Be careful not to rip the pak."
1,Does Not Work!!!,"Don't purchase this item. It does not work! I trusted this pak to keep my stuff dry when I went to a water park. This pak may be okay if you are getting splashed with water, but thats about it. I actually went swimming with this on and all of my stuff was wet when I opened it. You can't actually put this pak IN water. You would have better luck using a ziplock bag. I wish I would have tested this out when I first purchased it. Because I waited 5 weeks I am now not able to return it. Big waste of time and money."
4,"tough product,needs to be bigger","Nice tough product.I knew the size before I bought, but I wish is was larger. I will put a copy of my passport in it while I snorkel.Reason why buying---Going on a cruise and taking shore excursions."
1,"plastic is so thin, can't see this lasting very long","plastic is so thin, can't see this lasting very long. I expected this product to have a tad more strength and durability...seems like a great idea but made really cheap."
3,Sticky! Small.,"The images are really true to form with this product. The Alligator Wallet is relatively small, good enough only for a few cards and a bit of cash, maybe a single key as well.The performance is good, using two knobs to crimp together plastic bars, closing down a rubberish plastic bag. They get in the way a little when trying to insert items and retrieve them, and the rubbery material of the plastic sometimes sticks to the items, making for a bit of finger wrestling to retrieve your stuff.There are larger, better performing packs out there, if you are willing to dish out the money."
4,Worked as described,"Purchased this Kwik Tek Dry pak to use on a trip to Dominican Republic. Spent considerable time swimming & snorkeling and used this pack all the time. Stuffed it in a velcro pocket of my swimming trunks and off I went. Worked like a charm. Perfect for holding a bunch of $$ bills, credit card, safe key & room key. One word of caution. When you receive your pack in the mail, there is a piece of cardboard inside each pack. It is so tightly inserted that you can tear or stretch the pack by accident. Try folding the cardboard inside the pack to make it easier to remove. Aside from that, I was pleased overall."
4,Dry Pak,"This pouch worked really well on most of our snorkeling trips, keeping our credit cards, money, and other small things dry. We did notice a tiny bit of dampness after a 1/2 day snorkeling in fairly rough water. Overall, worked great!!"
4,works well,It works well to keep water out. It is like a super zip loc bag to keep your belongings dry.
4,Not a bad pouch! Definitely airtight.,"The pouch made an excellent water seal - I put money, electric car door unlocker and driver's license and not a drop leaked in. That is, until I opened it. Water pools in the top, so make sure you shake it off before you open it. Otherwise the water it did such a great job of keeping out falls right inside."
4,water wallet,"The seal at the top of the bag is a little bulky, but no leaks to worry about. Good for the beach or boating."
2,Beware of SIZE,"This ""wallet""seems functional enough,have yet to go to beach though.I was very dissapointed in it's size,although what you see in the picture,a few credit cards drivers license,and money will fit,that's all!(you better have 50's for money,a wad won't fit!I didn't expect much,but caution,you can carry VERY LITTLE in this packet.Inexpensive enough so I won't return it,Amazon's return policy is very fair,but not worth keeping or returning.There must be something better Amazon has,so browse carefully and LOOK AT THE PICTURE!I would not recommend this product."
2,hinge broke on first day,Works but you must be very careful... I broke one of the 2 black plastic closure knobs somehow...I didnt handle it roughly at all but it broke somehow..It still works but my money and I.D was slightly damp as a result.Dont trust this for meds or a phone as you will need to put it in a ziplock first and the into pack. I bought this for a snorkel trip but Im disapointed in its performance as it looks to be good quality...
2,works but..........,"this thing keeps contents bone dry, that is if you dont rip it trying to open the package, and as of the ""contents"" i mentioned, you would be lucky to fit a credit card and a small set of keys, this thing is TINY i cant even fit my blackberry in there."
1,Doesn't work,"Every time I used this dry pak in a pool or beach water would get in. I also purchased a bigger one, which would also let some water in. The only system that seemed to work is to place the items in the small dry pak and then the small dry pak in the bigger dry pak. Anyway, I would not put anything that can be ruined by water inside these dry paks."
3,Too small,I intend on using this on vacation. I think it is going to be too small for what I want to put in it. I will just have to downsize I guess. Have not tried it out to see if it is waterproof.
3,They are flimsy,"These things break constantly. On several occasions, we've broken 2 sets or more on a single camping trip with 3 rafts. The problem lies in the screw-together joint at the center of the oar shaft.Never-the-less, these things are so dirt-cheap, that I can't justify spending $50 or more on wood oars, when I can just buy extra plastic ones to use as replacements every year, so I will probably end up buying more of these soon."
3,Won't stand up to drunk people,"We purchased these for use with maneuvering a four-person tube on the Arizona salt river. As expected, most of us end up intoxicated. From drunken rowing, trying to avoid logs, rocks, or even just the side of the river, these oars were no longer rigid half way through our first trip. the central reinforcing line of plastic had given. By the end of the second trip, the area where the two pieces threaded together had broken on both oars, and they were promptly thrown away at the end of the river. After, I purchased this: (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SKI74S/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img) and they've faired far, far better."
2,Not quite there.,"They got the right idea, they're light weight, can disassemble them for bringing in the car. However they're slightly fragile, after two minutes of rowing the plastic oar snapped. If it was not for the fact that I could duct tape some tree bark to a stick I would say you get what you pay for but the tree-bark stick combo cost a bit less than 15 dollars."
4,Very nice,"The oars are easy to assemble and hold up nicely! They are light weight, they work well with most inflatable rafts and easy enough for youths to use them."
5,great,cheap great and very fast shipping. bought these for our little rafts when we went to the lake and they worked great. none of them broke but if they did theyre cheap enough to just buy new ones.
1,Made both our cat and dog VERY ILL!,"We treated our cat and dog with this product, both of them became very ill, vomiting and shaking for some 8 hours. Symptoms presented themselves approximatly 2 hours after application. We followed the instrustions carefully."
4,The Battle for Bastogne in 156 Text & Photo Pages,"As with all of the books in the Battleground Europe series, BASTOGNE is a combination of historical overview, selective detailed reference and compendium of italicized first-hand accounts. This book is not meant to be an in depth study of the Ardennes Campaign around Bastogne, but a concentrated dose of the battle and helpful roadside touring information. There are some ""Then and Now"" type comparisons, however on the whole the book is very similar to the US Army War College series (Which, by the way, was not published the the US Army War College) guides to Civil War sites. Currently this is the second book book in the Battle of the Bulge segment of the series. The first book, St. Vith, is in the same format. As a supplemental reference to the battles around Bastogne, this book is highly recommended. If you are planning a visit to Bastogne, I recommend that this reference be packed along with your travel brochures, Micheln guides and roadmaps."
4,The chronicle of family falling apart,"A thoughtful and interesting book about a family falling apart in the wake of tragedy.After one of Greg's football players (he's a high school coach) is struck by lightning and lies near death, he and his wife, Patty, start to wonder what else is out there and what they might be missing in their lives. At the same time, their twin teenage daughters undergo a transformation as they grow up and learn what life is really all about.This is an absorbing, nearly can't-put-it-down novel about a family in suburbian Portland -- one of my favorite cities. I greatly enjoyed this book and I will pursue others by this author."
3,The Human Drama Unfolds,"""A Trick of Nature"" insinuates itself beneath the consciousness of your everyday life, making you think of it at odd moments during your day...as if the characters were somehow real, and you worried about their lives. How Suzanne Matson pulls off such a feat is the incredible beauty of this novel. However, due to some editing and continuity flaws, this story falls short of being nearly perfect.Matson breathes life into all of her characters in a manner similar to Catherine Ryan Hyde (Pay It Forward, Electric God), but without the dramatic emotional insight that would bring them up out of the story and into emotional realism. While I thoroughly enjoyed ""A Trick of Nature"", it left me feeling somehow cheated, like something was being held back from me...some vital and important piece I wasn't privileged to.All in all, I would recommend this book for those searching for a good diversion from reality for awhile."
3,"Fragile, Decaying American Dreams","This book is a disappointment. If I'd had any other library books left, I might not have finished it. This isn't meant to be harsh, but a comment on the inherent challenge of writing about emotionally torn and socially isolated characters.Certain moments are spot-on with accurate emotional detail and realistic action (like Patty's sudden claustrophobic reaction to motherhood and marriage juxtaposed with her blissful taste of false independence). Too many other scenes are unnatural, forced, or vague (like Greg's teaching career).Still, Matson is skilled at the craft and the characters each find their own path to or from disillusionment and depression. I also admire her ability to make lifelike and seemingly minor details (like a set of sheets) carry a lot of weight in the overall plot."
5,Excellent Book,If you are in the Plastics industry this is a great reference book. Has excellent sections on polymers and extrusion process.
4,Rip-roaring fun,"You gotta wonder how one guy can harness so many funny and confounding situations. Definite talent. This books gives you the sense that even as life hits--and you literally get lost in the wilderness, personally experience an earthquake or skunk, or fall from a horse--things are not just going to be okay, they're actually a decent part of the great ride of life."
5,Step into magic,"This is perhaps my favorite Charles de Lint book, and is definitely one of my favorite books of all time. I've read Greenmantle three times since I discovered it in 1997. I can't go into the woods now without looking for Mystery, secrets, and secret villages where the Old Traditions live. If you want a book that will make you believe in magic, read Greenmantle."
5,My first Charles de Lint,"This was the first Charles de Lint book that I had ever read, and it hooked me on the rest.They Mystery that is woven through out the pages is fantastic and ""felt good"".I see that another reviewer has recommended an order for reading the books. I will go back and do that now, instead of reading them when ever I could find them."
2,Avoid,"I liked his Little Country (1991), so I thought I'd try an earlier one when I saw this in a very cute used bookstore. Besides, I was in the mood for a little mystery/fantasy page-turner. Unfortunately, this is pure tripe. Avoid.EDIT: For some reason my review comes up with 2 stars rather than 1. Amazon won't let me change it."
1,Touches of magic are smeared by propagandist,"Once again, as others have said, de Lint has done it again. He has taken an intelligent, solid, magical premise and used it to reiterate commonplace dogma-- ""Christians tried to take Mystery and enslave it to their way of thinking"". This is the kind of obvious drivel one would expect from a fourteen-year-old Wiccan; whatever truths may be found here, are not the ones de Lint has his characters express."
5,One of Charles deLint's best works.,"Charles deLint is the master of urban fantasy, and Greenmantle is one of his finest works. I was thrilled to find out about the re-release of this book (as my old copy disappeared)! A mother and daughter trying to rebuild, a man trying to disappear, a horned girl who does, and a village that doesn't exist are all woven together with deLint's deft touch. Magic, mystery, action and heart can all be found in this wonderful book. He also adds exporations of folklore and religion, but is never heavy- handed. Required reading for any collector of deLint, or lover of urban fantasy."
3,"Not as good as ""Moonheart"" but not bad.","This book was half mafia crime drama and half fantasy. It would have been a better book if it concentrated more on the fantasy than the crime element. The way the paths of the characters in the book crossed was also kind of hokey. The book was'nt bad, it just was'nt all that great either."
3,"Good book, but a little tough to read","The difference in the cultures between math and computer science and mathematics could really be felt. I'm a mathematician type, and I thought the book was a little tough to read, because of his funky wording at times. Still, it's not bad."
3,Good resource for general and special educators.,"This book has several ideas and ready-to-use forms for managing the inclusion of special-needs children in general education classes. Good resource for those already working in inclusive settings, as well as those just trying to move that direction."
1,RCA Boombox- Wouldn't Recommended,"I ordered this boombox b/c it was under $50 dollars with a CD player. When I started testing all the figures, I noticed that my forward skip key on the CD player doens't work very well. You have to push it just right for it to work.Wouldn't recommend."
1,Poor Performer,"I have owned the X75 for nearly 5 months and it has been nothing but constant problems. It would never perform as advertised. First, the cartridges were haywire. Then the software balked; then stopped altogether. Save your money and go to the local copier shop. In 5 months I got no more than 5 decent color photo copies and none from scanning/enlarging. Terrible."
4,So Far So Good..,"I got this as a present for X-mas and haven't had any problems with it. Its a bit on the slow side, the print quality is about average, but all else is what I would expect from a low end printer."
2,Scrawny duster.....,very thin in feather content. Certainly not as pictured. Making for very difficult dusting.If one can call it dusting....
5,One of my favorite Hawaiian CD,"When I want to be happy with Hawaiian music, I always play this. Good tempo and stable voice. Highly recommend."
3,so-so,"Not a bad book, but I would go with ExamKrackers instead. Their material is more representative of the real MCAT. Besides, the test-taking advice offered in this book is redundant and generally not that helpful. With even a little bit of practice, these ""tips"" are pretty obvious. The only redeemable thing about the book is the fact that its tests are difficult enough to be informative."
3,hard to understand,"i just got this player, and it sounds fine, but the instructions are unclear, and i still dont know if you can create MP3 files, or have to use mp3 cd's. i really didnt like the headphones it came with, but i bought some philips foldable sport headphones, and they are totally awesome. so i give this product 3 stars. it looks good and sounds good, but the instruction manual is very unclear."
1,This CD Player is cheap and crappy!!!,"I bought this cd player because I needed a player with a MP3 player and FM radio. When I got home and opened the package I was very pleased. The headphones were comfortable even though I had already bought my own headphones. The sound system was very nice and clear and the stations came in pretty well. But after having it only 2 days, the volume buttons on the side began sticking and I had to take the cd player apart and push them back out twice. I would push the volume button and it would go in and stay stuck. The sound would go out and you couldn't hear a single thing. I highly advise anyone who wants a good cd player not to buy this one.. go for SONY or PANASONIC."
3,It is okay,"This player is good for the first year or so, but after that the CDs and mp3's will not play. Ican no longer listen to cds, but the radio is awsome. If the player is too cold, it will not work at all. in the winter ihad to stick it in front of a heater to get it to turn on. I wouldjust get a regular Mp3 player for this price that i payed for this one($89.99)."
2,Its ok,this cd player is good if u want one for running but if u tap it it skip a lot and it has no backlight and one of my buttons stick. a person said it didn't skip at all and it was great. well ur lucky. I would not buy this cd player for the amount they sell it for.
3,A problem,"Aight, this is the deal. I just bought this CD player today and its great, except for one thing...every time I try to play a CD, the songs keep crackin. It's not skipping, its just cracking, and ALOT! I tried playing different CDs too but its the same for all of them. I'm goin to try callin these people up in the morning and see what's up."
5,ORDINARY PEOPLE,"EXTRAORDINARIA PELICULA MERECIO LOS PREMIOS,SOLO FALTO A MARY TYLER MOORE EL DE MEJOR ACTRIZ, QUE ARGUMENTO Y UNA MAGNIFICA DIRECCION DE ROBERT REDFORD( OSCAR )...INOLVIDABLE DRAMA."
5,Bought as gift,Depressing movie I thought. But my brohter wanted it. Arrived quickly and in good shape no complaints here.
5,Not so ordinary,I saw this movie five years ago and it still stirs me deeply today. There is a lot one can receive from this movie. The people in this movie were not so ordinary. It allows one to see what happens in the lives of people. It had a great ending.
1,Ordinary snoozer,"Very rarely do I not finish a movie, but is one of them. It is boring. Drink some coffee or take a nap before watching this over-rated crap."
3,I thought it was going to be better,"When my aunt told me about this movie, it sounded pretty good. So we waited for a long time until it came to our video store. I was the first to watch it and I didn`t even think it was as good as my aunt said it would be."
1,Doesn't actually work,"Hello,I bought this movie for my husband's birthday gift, so it wasn't opened and tested until just recently and we discovered that it is in a European format which will not play in our DVD machine nor another that we tried. Therefore, I would actually like to ask for my money back so that I can order another copy that works.Thanks for your help,Kristen"
2,I don't get it!,"I rented this because I am trying to meet my goal of seeing all the Best Picture winning films. I sat watching it waiting for something to happen! What was it about? What was the point? Who cares? Why the depressing story of a dysfunctional family, trying to get over the death of their son is entertainment, I'll never know. I didn't think that Mary Tyler Moore did an overly good job, nor did Donald Sutherland. Judd Hirsch did an excellent job, but he was the only one who even came close to Oscar quality, and he didn't even win! All I can say is, that it's a mildly interesting movie, shot in a beautiful area, and it posesses wonderful direction."
2,Buyer beware...,"The second disc is not even a DVD; it is a CD containing music by Echo & the Bunnymen, Erasure, INXS and a-ha. It is the same disc included on other ""I love the 80's"" DVDs. It has nothing to do with the movie. It is a total rip-off -- Totally misleading advertising. You get nothing on this set that was not included in prior editions of Ordinary People."
4,the epitome of overcoming a crisis,I have seen this movie at least 25 timesthe acting is top notch the cast is well seasoned and the soundtrack is breathtaking.this is definately a welcome addition to any home video collection.
2,It's So.................Ordinary,"Overall, this was disapionting. Just a combination of suicidal, ordinary people. Honestly, I could barely sit throught the whole thing. I love sad movies, but they packed so much emotion, into an otherwise plotless movie.... it was under-written and over acted. Its so...........Ordianry, really. I do not recconmend this film."
3,Good... but not Oscar good.,"Ok, so I watch this film and it was ok. That's all it was, just ok. Maybe if Robert De Niro was in it and if it was about boxing then maybe, just maybe I would give it five stars. How this film won an oscar over a masterpiece such as Raging Bull is just beyond me. It makes me frustrated. So frustrated that I have to go steal things from the C store. My advice to you if you actually want to watch this film is to pick up a copy of Raging Bull and after watching both ask your self which was really oscar worthy? (if you say Ordinary People than please jump off of nearest cliff possible)"
1,And the Oscar should have gone to...Raging Bull,"Orindary People was a pretty good book and a pretty dull movie. Not even in the same league as Raging Bull, which it beat for best picture in 1980. Talk about superior performances, De Niro and Sorcasse at their best, it doesn't get any better than that. But look what happened in the end, Raging bull is the 20 in AFi top 100 films and Orinday People is far behind."
1,The Worst Ever Winner Of Best Picture Oscar.,"Not only the worst film ever to win the Best Picture Oscar but also how on earth did Redford win the oscar for Best Director, it's not as if it was a bad year, i.e. Raging Bull!An absolute travesty on a par with the ridiculous wins of the Best Director Oscar for Warren Beatty in 1981, Kevin Costner in 1990 and Mel Gibson in 1995.Can somebody explain to me how these part-time 'star' directors have all won an Oscar for direction when the likes of Hitchcock, Kubrick and Scorsese never have?"
4,Great for babies under one year,Babies love lights and movement and this toy provides both. The only thing that I am disappointed about is the music. The music it plays does not have very good sound quality and it is not loud enough.
1,The 23rd Mistake,"The 23rd Mistake is buying this book. I bought the unabridged audiotape. If you have been to b school, have managed for more than a couple years or manage in a professional service business, do not waste your time with this book. It was all I could do to get through the first tape but since I had spent good money I forced my self to listen to the whole thing. The advice is not only pretty elementary, the tape is put together with so much preview--what we're going to tell you, and so much review--what we just told you, that unless you have a very short attention plan, 2/3ds is repetitive."
4,"very interesting, I reccomend the lecture","I was for a long time curious about finding out more about this fascinating part of women's bodies. The book is great in giving you lots of information about it, as well as how to better use your skills to give your girl more pleasure. It gives great descriptions about what some women may or may not like. Unless you are an expert in sex, you should read this book. It will help you when you are in those most intimate moments with your women. Not only I advise this book, but also to read other sex books. Most men think they know everything about women, as I used to think myself, but after I started reading this kind of books I realised I knew nothing about it. So if you want to have a better sexual life (and therefore a better overall life), start reading more. I reccomend this book as one of the first you should take it. I liked and my girlfriend loved the improvements I made."
1,misleading synopsis,"This book was VERY disappointing. It was much more about swinging than about BDSM. Any BDSM scenes were so stereotypical, it was worse than the free stories I can find online. Also, this ""strong, independent woman"" is only so for about the first paragraph of the book. The rest of the time, she is a mindless slave. Oh, wait, that's right, she's not a real slave - she can over-rule her master any time she really wants to, which happens often throughout the book. There is nothing in here about the conflicting forces wihtin her, and everything about her desire to please her master. In all, I was very very disappointed with this book and I ended up throwing it away since I (unfortunately) didn't read it until after the 30-day return period."
4,Submit!!,"Maria takes a journey into a paradise of submission, her paradise anyway. The author is able to display her true self in this novel: even some of her irritating ways. The sex was good and best of all realistic; there are a couple of chapters that really show how far she is willing to go. I suppose some might find urination a little much....but come on, the Talaban like right wing aren't in charge yet, let it all hang out; and thats just what happens. I particularily like how she tells the tale of their first full encounter with another couple. The book has a lot of realism and a real look at what makes Maria tic...definitely worth a read."
1,Can I leave less than 1 star?,"This book is utter tripe. If you're interested in BDSM relationships, find another and don't waste your money. It has nothing to do with a realistic m/s relationship, and frankly, the woman, Misassa, is not a slave, she's arrogant, narcissitic and as pompous as they come. The ""slave rules"" she quotes were ripped right out of a piece I read on the net 12 years ago.Unless you're a complete masochist, leave this book alone. It's painful to your mind."
1,Pompous poof,"The author's constant ""I am better and more beautiful"" than anyone else gets cloying.She seems to think that Dominance/submission consists solely of swinging (which she always spells with a capital S--why?)For many, many pages she can't achieve a successful swinging relationship--everyone else is fat, ugly, impotent--which to the reader (suffering through her attitude, just like her partners) is not much of a surprise."
5,Awesome Review Book,"It's just as good as learning from the authors in person. Comprehensive with nice discussion of answers, sectioned by system, and a good format to review topipcs."
2,Tiny mazes,"An example of read the fine print. I SHOULD have noticed the size of the book before ordering- it is quite tiny, and somewhat hard to keep open to do the mazes. Bottom line- grandson didn't care for these."
4,Architectural GRAPHIC Standards,"This was a good reference. It is the supplement to the original Architectural Graphic Standards, so you need to have it first to use this one. The set up is the same as the original and the index in the back serves the Supplement as well as the original which is very nice."
3,Warning! One cuff only!,"Okay, here's the good: It is a well made cuff, easy to put on and take off. But...Seriously, only one cuff? Last I checked, most people have two arms and legs. The picture clearly shows two, but the quantity is never made clear in the listing. This means that the actual price is actually twice what is shown if you want a set. Of course, now I have to pay a second shipping charge to get the second cuff, as well. Bad show, Dot Devil. Please make your listing more clear. Pity. My girlfriend and I were looking forward to trying these out this weekend. We were pretty disappointed to only find one cuff in the box. Maybe next weekend."
1,"Don't buy this item, it doesn't work","This item was supposedly designed and manufactured to restrain someone, but it doesn't begin to accomplish that. Whether someone has a large or small wrist doesn't matter, they can easily turn and move their hands to undo the Velcro fastening with ease in less than 30 seconds. I don't recall reading anything about the article not being returnable, and IT WASN'T, so I also couldn't return it back to Amazon!"
3,-sigh-,"This is a very very thick product, I can't recommend it for first time users.ALSO, the inner battery case is cumbersome to remove, and I accidentally broke it in the process.The vibration is rather weak too, and after only three uses it seems erratic and unreliable"
5,The Africa Diaries: An Illustrated Memoir of Life in the Bush,We just stayed in a African camp (Selinda) managed and owned by the Joubert's. I wish I had read their account of the region before I went to Africa. It was a great synopsis of the highlights of their life in the bush. The pictures they captured illustrate the stories they portray. I recommend it highly.
3,No Subtitles for Songs (Spark Edition),"There are NO subtitles for the several songs in the Spark edition of Nigahen. This is a major disappointment for those who want to know the lyrics of the songs. However, this edition is free of watermarks and logos. (There ARE subtitles for the songs in the Shemaroo edition of this movie, but the Shemaroo edition displays a watermark on every frame of the movie after the opening credits.)The movie itself is a rather decent sequel to Nagina (1986)."
2,A Big Disappointment,"Although the sound is very good, the DVD player hardly recognizes any DVDs. I usually have to turn the unit on and off several times to get it to recognize a DVD. These are newly released DVDs and DVDs that are a couple years old. I'm going to end up buying a seperate DVD player because this one is so bad. It's not just mine. Read a few reviews of their RTD255 unit. I'm giving it 2 stars just because the sound is good."
1,DOES NOT WORK!!,"I have had to contact RCA multiple times because this player does not play anything. It will just randomly decide that DVDs (brand new) are not of the right format?! The first time I called RCA, they said I needed to clean the lens and that they were going to send me a cleaning kit. It never came. I bought one myself, but cleaning wasn't the problem. The product does not work."
5,"Pretty nice, kinda pricey though","The company I work for has been using Starret for years so I figured I'd go to with Starret. While I was waiting for it to ship, I purchased a cheap auto center punch at Menards for around $7 to do some work on my truck I had been putting off. This Starret is 1000x better. For non-commercial applications, I don't think it's worth $30, but I'm rating the item not the price, so I'm giving it 5 stars."
1,not as creamy as I'm used to.,I'd agree that the chaokoh brand has a much better product. I had heard good things about this brand and bought a whole case...bummer. I'm used to a thick and creamy white coconut milk with 17g of fat per serving. This has only 10g of fat and is watered down looking.
3,OK,It is a good deal however this is not my favorite coconut milk. It lacks the sweetness and it is more like dissolved flour. Still it makes an OK Thai dish.
1,Great Product Gone Bad,"I used to be a big fan of Thai Kitchen's coconut milk and green curry paste. Now the coconut milk is thinner in consistency and flavorless and the curry paste has lost all its fire. Bummer, as it's hard to find quality products (of any kind) these days. Interesting note?--Thai Kitchen was recently acquired by another, larger company. Looks like the ""recipes"" have changed. As will mine."
2,Bad batch?,"Normally the Thai Coconut milk is great - very smooth and tasty. For some reason every can in the 12 pack I ordered was chunky meaning there were chunks of coconut in it. It's kind of hard to drink chunks of coconut, and I didn't have anything to filter them out. It was the same kind I always get (I checked the cans a few times) so I'm guessing I got a bad batch or something."
1,It is not pure coconut milk - contains ghar gum,"Bought two cans of this brand to make coconut ice cream and one of my guests took one spoon full when I took the paddle out and had a serious allergic reaction causing her hives and other reactions.Since she had previously eaten a different dish with coconut milk from another company we looked to see the difference. In this case the can said it was pure, but on the label at another place it stated that it contained ghar gum which is apparently used to thicken it so as to make it look more like coconut cream. Search for ghar gum on the internet and see the possible complications before eating it.No one else had such a reaction, but not all the ice cream was eaten after seeing her reaction."
1,Cans received were 5/6 through edible lifetime,"The cans I received were packaged in November of 2007, and expire in November of 2009, about 4-5 months from now. Since I will only have 1/6 of the shelf life of the cans, I will give them 1/6 of a full positive rating, or one star. This is a hazard of ordering from Amazon, I guess. In a store I would have seen that and not bought them."
1,THEY HAVE WATERED DOWN THIS PRODUCT,SINCE NEW OWNERS - WATERED DOWN - 2 TABLESPOONS OF PRODUCT WAS 190 CALORIES --NOW 1/3 CUP IS 140 CALORIES - DOES NOT STIFFEN IN FRIGE - LIKE BEFORENOT TASTY LIKE BEFOREMORE WATER AND MORE GUAR GUM = JUNKCOMPLAIN TO THEM OR THEY MAY WATER DOWN MORE - THEIR PHONE NUMBER IS ON CAN. EXAMPLE OF PURE GREED.I WIL NEVER BUY AGAIN.
1,Why Did They Change It???,"I used to love Thai Kitchen Coconut Milk and bought it by the case. But they clearly changed the product and ruined a good thing.The old Thai Kitchen was thick and wonderful. It separated in my fridge and even on my kitchen counter if it was below 70 degrees or so. It whipped up into a lovely whipped cream.This stuff has the consistency of skim milk. It doesn't separate or harden even in the fridge. It doesn't whip up like heavy cream. The flavor seems watered-down.Apparently these folks never heard the adage, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."""
1,Totally agree with other reviews. Watered down product,It used to be good but now the quality is so bad. I've switched to using 'Golden Star' Coconut milk after experimenting with various brands. That one has got best flavor and consistency and quality too. Thai coconut has kept only the product branding and packaging consistent. The product itself is of low quality now.
2,Badly needs an editor,"Personal knowledge management--understanding and managing ones personal knowledge, assumptions, and skills--is an important area. Little general information on personal knowledge management is available, so any book on the subject is working looking at. This book might have been a good overview and introduction, but I could barely force myself to read the first 30 pages.The book seems reasonably well organized, but poorly written; any editor worth minimum wage could have worked with the author to bring the writing quality up to something readable. Given the effort and cost of writing, publishing, and distributing a book, I'm surprised this one made it into print at all.I rated it 2 stars on the assumption that there is good material hidden behind the poor writing. Hopefully the publisher will get an editor to clean it up for a 2nd edition."
2,disappointed,I was disappointed with this bracelet. The stones were too light and it wasn't great quality. You could only see the silver on the bracelet because the stones faded into the silver due to their lack of color. I returned this item.
2,So...So,"I am a big Romantic suspense fan and I've been waiting for this book for a long time.Unfortunately, this book was very strong in military knowledge & action (which I love) but very light on romantic chemistry. There was no emotion between the two characters. I found them more interesting as partners than I did as a couple, I didn't believe that they were really attracted to each other.I love Cherry Adair's books...but this one, the last in the Wright Series was disappointing."
