3,Decent Katana set but blades were loose.,Quick shipping from the seller. Decent set with wooden scabbards but unfortunately the blade on the katana was loose so I had to return the set. Amazon refunded my amount as soon as they received the item back. This would have been a decent show set for the price had that one blade not been loose.
2,my product came broken,yes hello my product came broken ...... one of the bottem part of the sword is broken ?????????????? y is that ...... help ...... can i return them of new one ???????
2,well,"My first order was said to be lost & did not come in. I had to call constantly checking & changing traking numbers. The order came in late & was shipped by ups. they leave packages on the doorstep without giving anyone time to get to the door, that is, even if you are home. In which case anyone can take it. The swords themselves look okay & everything but they are not sharp at all! nowhere on the page does it mention this. i have bought the swords as a present & who really wants to give dull swords to their boyfriend for christmas! if i would have known that i would not have ordered the product to begin with!"
2,ok,was refunded all my money due to the shipping people not the company i bought it from. the company worked with me very well
3,"fun toy, good price, not as stable as ""brand name"" trains","the cars are solid wood, as such are likely going to be durable. The elephant's details are painted pretty dark as mentioned elsewhere, no big deal though. They are a bit tippy on tracks though, and don't stay on as well as the ""brand name"" trains like thomas, chuggington or even Melissa&Doug. I think I paid less for this entire set than a single Thomas engine costs though, so that's fine. It connects ""ok"" to other cars, on some the magnet profile is less rounded so it's a bit crooked, but it works"
4,Cute stand alone train set,"This train set is fun for my toddler son because he likes to put the animals in and out of the cars. It doesn't roll as well as some of his other trains on the wooden track set we have, so I keep it out for him to play with without the track. I would recommend this train if you're thinking of using it without a track."
5,Wooden Brio-Like train,My daughter loves this! She plays with my old Brio train and this fits great. She asked for it specifically from Santa b/c it was animals!
3,"tiny train, made in China","The train is fine, however, I think the seller should let us know the size of the item. Fairly important piece of info. The train is very small and not real easy for little fingers to manipulate. Also, if the darn thing is made in China, why not say so? China good, China bad, let me decide (it is made in China)."
4,train set,"My grandson liked it, but it was an unnecessary purchase since the Kid Kraft bucket set already had trains in it."
3,wooden animal train set,"My three year old loves this train, which fits well on his Thomas wooden railway. However, the roof keeps coming off the car, so I keep having to glue it back together, and making sure the 15 month old doesn't touch it."
2,boring,"people who sent it were great - good service. The book is super boring and not interesting. Unless you have to, I wouldn't waste your time reading it."
4,A superb quick-reference for Christians on U.U.,"Dr. Gomes has provided a handy, easy-to-use quick-reference on Unitarian Universalism that will give you the facts you need at your fingertips to understand Unitarian Universalism and to contrast it with classical, biblical Christianity. If you buy one book on U.U., this should be it."
5,Unitarian Universalism,This book is awsome and wonderfully informative. As with everything one reads....it should be taken with a grain of salt and then if necessary make yourself dig even deeper for more information to support what you've read. This book answered numerous questions I'd been tossing around in my head....most I was pretty sure about with that gut feeling and then reading it just evened things out... balanced the scales. I only wish there were more insightful books out there like this to help others hopefully open their eyes. Thanks for a great read!
1,Uninformed - Closed Minded -,"This book is an uniformed, poorly structured, poorly researched, closed minded piece of garbage. Don't bother reading this or anything else by this scared little man who must make himself feel better by belittling others. Obviously he has so little personal faith that he must attack others to cover up for his own weaknesses."
1,"An interesting ""gift""","A fundamentalist gave me this book to read to convince me I was part of a cult. After reading and enjoying the part of our UU history, I then started to laugh out loud at the rest of the book. Mr. Gomes wouldn't know a cult if he was the member of one, which I think he is. So, I cut out the laughable sections, gave them back to the fundamentalist, and now I have a neat book about the history of UU. Thanks for doing the research Mr. Gomes, now go get a life."
2,An interesting read,"Having had an interest in hypnosis for a number of years meant that I was interested in technique and to learn - the book was chosen for its ""How to"". After reading it several times I failed to understand ""how to"" and more of the reasons ""why"". Whilst the book was interesting I think it failed to hit the mark for me"
3,13.5 inch sleeve does not fit 13.5 laptop,"I bought this product for my daughter's 13.5 inch laptop computer.It does not fit 100%, it will not zip closed, and a small portion of the computer is exposed.She wanted something to help protect her computer while she transports it in her backpack, which it does, so we kept it.Built NY's products are very high quality. I was simply disappointed that that ""13.5 inch laptop sleeve"" does not fit a 13.5 inch laptop."
3,It's Semi-Amazing,"The majority of these stories are pretty goofy. They are typical Spielberg where they have realistic stories but filled with unrealistic events that provide that Spielbergian magic. Some work and some don't. I do like the big name actors that are in these, but I wasn't blown away by the actual stories. Maybe I just expected too much. I never saw this when they originally aired, so maybe they are just a bit too dated. In any event, if you loved the originals, go ahead and get. If you are a bit skeptical, stay away."
4,1980's fun,Keeping in mind these are from the 1980's it is a few hours of fun to watch and also to see how they mirror some movies that came out in the theaters over the past 15 years.
4,Great Series!,This is a great TV series. Some stories might be a little weird but all are entertaining and original. My favorite episode is the The Mission.
4,it is worth it just for MUMMY DADDY!,"THIS WAS A FUN SERIES, MANY EPISODES WERE REAL GOOD!THE BEST EPISODE IS ""MUMMY DADDY"""
4,"Nice collection, but sometimes boring!","The box of this classic series from the 80s is fine. The stories are often lame like the first one (Spielberg wrote a lot of them), but some are very entertaining. I will buy the second box to complete my collection, but I still prefer ""The twilight zone"" and ""Tales from the crypt"""
1,horrible audio,The audio is terrible. I have to turn up the volume on the television to the maximum to be able to hear it.
5,WHY SOOO LONG!!!,I loved this show as a kid and im glad it finally came out. But come on already what is taking so long to release season 2?? Come on universal im an avid collector and i hate when my collections aren't complete....Please hurry!!!!
5,Amazing Stories on DVD,I was so disappointed that the set of Amazing stories that they show on the SciFi channel are not available on DVD. I really hope they make them on DVD soon! I'll be waiting...
5,"""Amazing"" dvd!","As a fan of ""Amazing Stories"", I had to have the dvd - it didn't disappoint me. It's as fun to watch now as it was back in the 80s."
4,A Must Have,"This is a must have for anyone who grew up in the 80's looking for a little bit of nostalgia, I love these short story kind of shows like tales from the darkside and tales from the crypt,twilight zone etc. Amazing stories was great because it didnt focus so much on the horror aspect. Also this was a Steven Spielberg project and it shows it was very well put together considering the technology at the time. I am in the market for season 2 now! I can still remember sunday nights sitting in front of the tv waiting for this show to come on with my transformers toys and garbage pail kids cards not too far off. Dont settle for 80's nostalgia re-hashes grab a piece of the original, this show was as great as i remember it!"
4,Amazing Stories,"As I remember, Amazing Stories was on television on Monday nights opposite Monday Night Football. This was the reason for its poor ratings and subsequent cancellation after only two years. It never had a chance! Most viewers never watched it at all, especially during fooball season. There were at least two episodes that I remember distinctly that were not included in the posted listings of the episodes. I wonder what happened to them. One was I believe titled 'The Card', telling the story of a woman harshly punished for running up a charge card. The other involved a young couple who discovered old photographs of primative tribesmen, only to have the tribesmen come to life in their suburban home. Both of these episodes were absolutely wonderful. I'd sure like to be able to find copies of them."
4,Amazing Stories,"I remembered a couple of these great episodes when they debuted on TV in 1985. Specifically, ""The Mission"" & ""Mirror, Mirror"", that are still great. I am currently in the process of viewing the rest of this first season and am enjoying each episode. I hope that Universal will also release the second and final season on remastered DVD as it did this first season in 2006."
3,Opinion,"Mummy daddy was my sole reason for buying this dvd set, funny stuff. As for the others, they were ok."
3,"Cool stories, but doesn't hold up to the test of time","My best advice to you is go buy the Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits. These stories are dated and not timeless like those are.I couldn't get all the way through it yet, and I've owned it for more than a year.If you would like to remember such great stories as the guy in the bomber who draws cartoons... well its here."
1,America's Out Islands: The Florida Keys,"Old and poor quality. Only aimed at cruising, not the islands themselves.Seems to be misrepresented"
4,Good stuff,"sounds good, well produced, solid overall. buy it! musicianship is quite good. lyrics are poetry in action."
3,"Good start ... plummets into Earth, Wind and Fire!?","I continue to try all of this genre and find myself continually disappointed at the chaotic ""golly gee"" nature of the music. This disk starts very promising but turns, literally, into a kind of EW&F electronic jam session with cheap background audio clips. Of course, if you like it, by all means, enjoy."
5,Great Book,A very good book on the reasons of insomnia. Helpful explanations of the causes of the three different kinds of insomnia and what may be contributing to your sleeplessness. Worked for me!
2,Knot for the inexperienced,I borrowed this book from the library and it was full of black and white diagrams. So if you are into diagrams and arrows this book is for you. I was really disappointed.
4,A good intermediate knot tyers book,"This is a enjoyable book with many usefull knots and good information on applying many of them.There are many errors in the line drawn instructional drawings which could create alot of headaches for someone without somewhat of a knotting background.Personally I found the globe knot sections drawings a little confusing but workable.Of the many of already familiar knots I found interesting and better ways of tying them by using this book. Just that aspect and the icicle hitch to show your friends is well worth it.All in all this authors books are good reading, nothing overly complex, but a good addition to have in a knotting book collection."
4,Knots not weaving,"This book is nice but seems incomplete. While the knots are well diagramed and fairly easy to follow, there is little to tell you how the knot can be used. The cover shows woven ropes/lanyards but this information is lacking. Yes the book claims to be about knots, and that it is. Hope the the author takes the time to write another edition including more weaving techniques."
1,I do not give product reviews so I hate this,I do not give product reviews so I hate this. I should not be required to write something here. this is ridiculous! I got my product what more do you need to know really.
2,No clear with all drawings.,"Layard knots, worked out well. Most other knots not so clear on how to go from one step to another. A better book would be Leather Braiding by Bruce Grant."
2,Old Sailor,Not quite what I expected. Some of the diagrams were difficult to follow. Some of the animated on-line knot sites were more useful.
2,Lousy diagrams and no detailed instructions,"It's a pretty book, but of little use if you want step-by-step instructions. I found more help online for free that in this book. Skip it and save the bucks and disappointment."
2,Disappointed with Quality,"Maybe I'm a puzzle snob, but I like thick, quality puzzle pieces that lie flat, don't curl, and really fit together well. This puzzle was very disappointing. We love the Scrambled States game and book, but the quality of the puzzle was not up to par. The pieces came out of the box already curled as if they had seen some major humidity. They were so bad that when you joined a few pieces together, others fell apart because they were so warped. We usually buy Ravensberger puzzles, or the like, that stand the test of time, and this one just doesn't measure up. I love the story, the content, and the concept, but the physical quality was seriously lacking. I wish I could return it, but we obviously opened it and played with it before realizing how bad it was."
5,Made in the USA Gift,"I bought this puzzle set as a gift. It looks very nice, and best of all, it's made in the USA. It says age 6 and up on the box."
4,"Great puzzle, low quality book","We love this puzzle and we already loved the book (from the library). But we were disappointed by two things. One is that the book is a very flimsy copy. It's like a comic book and very small. I wish I had just bought the actual book separately. Also, our puzzle came missing one piece. I've never had that happen. It's a piece of Uncle Sam's body. We can do it without the piece, but it's diappointing to not have a complete puzzle. Very strange that it came without that one piece. The pieces were in a sealed bag and all, but it wasn't in there."
2,"There is no ""book"" inside","I was very annoyed at the ""book"" inside which was really a tiny magazine-style booklet of the real book. The puzzle itself was very cool."
1,"If your looking for comprehensive knowledge, don't stop here.","Friedman attempts to describe the history of American involvement in Afghanistan, and the eventual creation of Al-Queda, as if its a simple slice of pie. He tends to gloss over very intricate and cumbersome episodes of that period as if there is nothing else worth mentioning. If you can keep an objective mind-frame while reading this, it may serve as a good springboard into the topic, but ultimately there is much left unsaid and much more to be understood. The history of American involvement in Afghanistan is covered in less than 20 pages in the first chapter. No references. No footnotes. Just a glossy summary. For a much more comprehensive look, I would suggest Steve Coll's ""Ghost Wars"". After reading that, you won't be able to help yourself from shaking your head at this attempt. Real cables, real interviews, real depth."
3,Grade = C. Some promise but major issues ignored,"Mr. Friedman's book discusses intelligently the background to the U.S. vs Al Qaeda struggle, and understands better than most bin Laden's probable aims, and some of our historical failures. The treatment of Iraq is weaker though and misses several key points while presenting our larger strategy of putting pressure on Saudi Arabia. Yet how can he profess to understand our Middle East strategy without regard to Israel and Oil, the former a key electoral group in the U.S and the latter as lifeblood of the world economy ? These glaring omissions prevent a worthwhile thesis from becoming a serious policy primer.More objective treatment of our naive encursion into Iraq would also be appreciated - the overall positive evaluation of Rumsfeld's and Cheney's strategy (not Bush's)is laughable when the road from Baghdad Airport to the Green Zone is the most dangerous in the country. Hello Beltway Boys - that is the reality over there."
3,Operation Iraqi LiBeration (OIL),"America does not need Iraqi Oil or Middle East Energy?The reason Europeans' specially the Russians were against the war is to ensure favorable price for Oil!These are some of the statement written in this book. However, he does stress one point which is very important and that is the main reason for the Iraq war is to show the world that we are serious on war on terror. Boy, 1200 American life to show the world is a risky and bad bet."
2,Not partisan? Not really.....,"I was taken in by the proclamation that this book was a straight, historical accounting - not a partisan point-of-view piece. Though it's true, there are no hysterical rantings and facts are used - many in context - just the same, there is a conservative perspective to the information in this book. Readers should just be aware that it's there and then can be free to assess the information in that frame, and not be duped by the protestations to the contrary. I don't believe this author is a chicken hawk, I also don't count him as a true historian."
3,This book is OK... but just OK.,"This book is obviously very informative, and does provide some unique insights, but overall its just pretty darn dull and after a few chapters in, you start to feel like you're just reading observations, stats and figures from a long winded data sheet. Its by no means a 'page turner'. I also found it annoying that it didnt include a clear map of all the middle-eastern countries it constantly refers to throughout the book. Its a good book to gain some inside knowledge of how the USA handles its world affairs, but for all it exposes it explains little. Im not quite sure how you could make a book of this topic more 'readable' but Im sure there is someway, its too bad that 'way' wasnt found, as it would have been a much better book for the reader."
3,Americas Secret War was informative,"I learned a lot from this book, I wouldn't read it for leizure unless you liked being bored to death"
5,Gundam Wing; Gundam Deathscythe Hell,"I got this kit because I wanted something cheap. I did not have very high hopes for the kit, but it looks rather good out of the box. Some of the colors are off being more blueish than black, but for ten dollars or less, I think I paid eight, it is something I would definitely recommend for anyone getting into model building. You get the scythe and a shield with an effect part for weapons. the articulation is not high grade quality, but this kit is not a high grade, so it is a bit smaller and it is easy and fun to put together. This being a model kit however, it has a lot of small parts so definitely not for little kids. It lacks some color, but it is definitely worth buying for such a low price."
3,Old standards and a few new twists.,Most of the techniques in the book I had done before. A very few were new. The book was very clear and the pictures were very helpful.
3,wasn't what i was looking for,"This book is thin, has a few ideas that wern't taught in class. I was looking for a book more about glazing and texturizing then how to cut stuff out of a slab of clay and glue it to your pot.its a cute little book."
1,provides minimal overview of few techniques,"Almost any other pottery book out there will give you more detail on the techniques of surface decoration offered here. Most of them will also provide you with more techniques and more inspiring photos to illustrate the techniques.He does provide a recipe for Egyptian paste which I had not seen before, and seems quite good at transposing pre-planned graphic designs onto pots in a way that makes tham appear to be pencil crayoned on.For any other technique, try a different book."
4,Pottery student,A basic book on surface and other decorating ideas. I bouight all three of his available books for my pottery library
1,worked great for about a month,"these antennas are pieces of junk. The cable is extremely fragile with no structural reinforcement at all. this antenna will break if you move it from location to location. best thing to do is get one for home and each vehicle because any handling of the cable will cause breakage over time. for thirty dollars you are already half way to a new receiver, makes no sense."
2,"Not exactly greatest, not exactly hits.","This volume is an attempt to chronicle the Byrds' work from ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo"" through ""Farther Along"". Most of the material on the album is quite good, but the last three cuts really don't belong there, especially when there is far better material which was excluded. Further, the inclusion of ""He Was a Friend of Mine"" on this album makes no sense, as it was recorded by the original lineup several years before. Better song selection would have helped this album immensely. As it is, it seems half-hearted and ultimately disappointing to discriminating Byrds fans, who really should pass on this one."
5,"Speed, Quality, Reliability","I recently purchased the 4050 from Amazon and couldn't be more pleased with the quality, ease of installation and use of this printer. The 1200 dpi is spectacular and halftones look great. The built-in Postscript capability is a godsend and I can't believe the speed with which the 4050 delivers copies! Although a printed manual would have been an asset, I haven't needed to look at the documentation disk. I highly recommend this printer for those who need a high-volume, top quality machine."
5,Good Quality Printer,"I bought this as a refurbished product but it's built like a tank and has been running without a hitch since I purchased it. Well worth the price, shipping and packaging were outstanding. Would buy again in an instant."
4,Good printer,"This printer was purchased used but it works fine and I have had no complaints thus far, around 6 months."
1,Let the buyer beware,"The printer came in and the print quality was terrible. We cleaned the rollers and have to replace the toner cartridge that was delivered with the machine. This printer should be a workhorse, however, if the print quality is bad you can't use it. Hopefully when the new toner cartridges arrive the machine could be used."
2,Waste of Talent,"I got this because I'm a fan of John Hopkins who is an accomplished stage actor in the UK yet to find his place in the larger media. He reminds me of a young Pierce Brosnan and has the looks, charisma and physical agility to be on the short list for the next James Bond. The brief shot of him in the shower was worth the cost.That said, this movie was a terrible waste of his and others' talent. The story is downright silly and the female lead spends so much of her time panting heavily (no, not for Mr. Hopkins)that I expected her to hyperventilate any minute. The basic premise of the plot, that a young English couple is abducted and brainwashed to carry out an assassination plan, defies credulity. This film is long on atmospherics and short on story."
1,Can I rate this as a negative?,"Arrgh! Please don't bother. Slow... slow... slow until eventually I gave up in disgust and boredom.While it was an intriguing idea, it just wasn't worth wasting my time on ... I've got better things to do with my life than waste any more of it on bad movies.Avoid Experiment."
2,Where's Ann Rule Now That We Need Her?,"Where's Ann Rule now that we need her? I live in Johnson County, KS, the site of this heinous crime, and I was very disappointed in ""Anyone..."" I wonder if the author has ever been in Johnson County, since there are many inaccuracies in this book. Lenexa is not North of Olathe, Dr. Wallace Graham's office was in Missouri, not Kansas, The Jewel Box was not a ""notorious"" night spot, and Queen Elizabeth had not just been coronated at the time of John Robinson's visit. In acknowledgments, Mr. Douglas states that his wife, Joyce, attended legal proceedings in Kansas City? Did Douglas not attend the trial?This book is definitely not for Johnson Countians, who are more familiar with this case and the area than Douglas."
2,Disappointed,"I have enjoyed other John Douglas titles such as Mindhunter, so I thought ""Anyone You Want Me To Be"" might be an interesting read. I was hoping for some insight from Douglas into the criminal mind, but instead found a dry narrative of a mediocre criminal and his career. I was actually relieved when I finished the book since I was contemplating abandoning it midway."
4,"Frightening Story, Frightening Man","An excellent read by John Douglas, and highly recommended for anyone who frequents Internet chat rooms! This isn't the first true crime novel I've read that took place in the state of Kansas, and I'm always amazed how much crime occurs in this (mostly) rural state. I'm also amazed that a man, who was a husband, father, and grandfather could get away with and fool people as he did, and for as long as he did. Maybe the previous characteristics are why. The only disappointment was the lack of pictures!"
2,Too Involved,"So many names, so many places, I couldn't keep up with it. I didn't read much as I don't waste my time reading books for pleasure that I don't like.alienface"
3,Not one of his best.,"I've read most of John Douglas's books, and am quite a fan, but this book didn't measure up to the others. I'm not sure why, except perhaps the UNSUB was not as interesting as others that he's written about. It won't stop me from reading everything else he's written though."
5,True story,"If you use the internet a lot, then this will make good reading for you and also demonstrate how so many hide behind a created facade. Sometimes with deadly consquences."
3,Good read,This book was a very good read. It went on a bit too much for me about the internet & the cops lives. But the story was well told.
4,Another good book from John Douglas,"This book is the story of John E. Robinson, Sr. who, while pretending to be a prominent and successful Kansas City business man and loving husband, father, and grandfather, progressed from con man, embezzler, and swindler, to sadistic serial killer of needy women; Robinson is presented as the first such killer to use the Internet to find his victims. John Douglas is not a brilliant writer, and the book could benefit from a bit more editing to take out redundant passages and grammatical errors. But Douglas (and/or his co-author Stephen Singular) is able to put a sentence together correctly, for the most part, and I read this book from cover to cover, not wanting to put it down before I finished it, which is more than I can say for most of the books I attempt to read these days."
4,Nice upgrade,"i higly recommend these updgrade, it gave my dell Inspiron a new boost, my machine isnt a lot more faster, but when i am running a lot of programs it fells like i am executing only one. and the price is $100 cheaper than dell."
3,Nice while it worked,"This microwave is compact, attractive, inexpensive, and does the job--for as long as it lasts. Mine lasted one year, then conked out. The timer and clock and buttons still work--everything but the carousel and microwave cooker."
2,Problems only days after warranty expired.,The LCD screen only shows half the numbers. Is it a 5 or an 8? Kind of hard to use the microwave if you cant read the lcd. I bought this just days over a year ago and now it's faulty. Microwave looks nice and functions nicely. There must have been a penny or two pinched on the lcd. I have calculators with the same technology that have lasted for 20 years. It's not a part that can be replaced yourself. So here goes a service call. I'll bet the repair costs more than the microwave. More to come.
2,Complex - Performs less than Satisfactory in Answering Calls,"Used version 3 and 4. Choices of mail boxes, answering calls,paging, and faxing. The first PC answering machine we used wasFaxWorks on a Packard Bell PC. In contrast, every other package we have tried performs a great deal of secondary options, yet they are less than adequate on answering phone calls for small businesses. Furthermore, if you listened to a message on HotFax and wanted to replay, you need to open another menu. Possibly for you if you don't need the voice service. It is also difficult to set up simultaneously with an All-in-One printer (HP OfficeJet). END"
1,Compatibility Problems,"Tried V4.0, did not reliably answer calls and it caused problems with my system seizing up when answering."
1,Ok for a home user but not for businesses,WinFax Pro was just not cutting it so we tried HotFax. It was clunky to use and the graphics hard to see. It was nice it would answer calls like a receptionist but not why we bought it. We ended up buying FaxTalk's Fax Center Pro. It was exactly the step up we needed from WinFax Pro. I wish HotFax had been it as it was less money.
5,Great Resource,"This guide is a great resource for those in the educational, community or youth-leadership development industry. It offers practical solutions and real-case scenarios to integrating service-learning into the academic curriculum. This is a must have."
5,uggs brooks,This boot is great! It fits comfortably and compared to the full suede uggs you can go into huge snow banks and water puddles and not worry about ruining the suede. The brown is a nice dark brown and goes with everything.
5,One of The Best Louisiana Cook Books Out There!,"If you have ever eaten at Mike Anderson's restaurants in New Orleans or Baton Rouge you know how good it gets. This cookbook lets you create some of the best south Louisiana seafood, make that the best seafood period, you will ever eat. Some of my favorites from the restaurant like Oysters Gaspard, The Guitreau, Mike's Special and the House Salad Dressing taste as though they are served straight out of Mike Anderson's kitchen. The recipes are easy to understand and simple to make. If there is only one Louisiana cookbook in your cupboard, this should be it!"
4,Good option for G6 camera,"I never thought I would brag about a point and shoot camera, but the Canon G6 is remarkable. And, the add-on lens is equally suprising. Granted, this is not an interchangeable SLR lens, but it's great for use with all the subjects one would shoot with this camera. I am glad I chose the Canon brand lens. Note: I use the Lensmate adapter."
1,I wish that Maude had Gonne sooner,"He lost his virginity at the age of 51, and his poetry undoubtedly got a great deal better afterwards. Political claptrap marred his works and spoilt some vaguely pleasant ideas. I am afraid that any man who spends his entire life concerning himself with politics and Celtic twilight missed a great deal of the reality of life. However, I am inclined to attribute a great deal of this to Ms Gonne, who without a shadow of a doubt was the main factor responsible for his horrendous 'Helen of Troy' images. To any student studying this text, I would urge them to remember Dr Derek Pezrekier's pithy comment at a lecture given at Berkley University, California: ""Mr Yeats - what did you spend the money on?"" to which a student replied ""What money?"" ""The money your mother gave you for brain surgery.""."
3,Somehow deceiving,Some parts are quite boring but the text is well written. I was deceived when I realized that it didn' t respect Ariakas's background as it was written in Chronicles Trilogy. The story is some kind of a waste of time when one thinks that it could be completely told in less than two pages. It's hard to believe that Takhisis used all of those characters just to guide her Champion to Firetomb.
4,Good book but...,I really enjoyed this book but there s a little thing that bothers me: Ariakas' father was killed by his own son if we refer to the Chronicles and it s not the case in this book. But I still recommend this book as it shows how Ariakas became such a powerful lord.
4,Evil can be Good,"Obviously Ariakas is my all time favorite character in the Dragonlance novels. I have been trying to get this book for years and finally succeded (thanks to amazon). Unlike other reviews this book i thought was not boring at all. There was plenty of sword figthing, magic and love making in this book, what more can you ask for. Ok, lets be honest, evil characters are the most interesting to read about. They are unpredictable, noncaring, and will kill anyone at anytime, but will always lose at the end :( (only bad thing). For those who have read the chronicles all know how Ariakas dies, which bothers me, think about this, he was a great swordsman, can cast spells with the aid of Takhisis, has immense physical strength, commands thousands,men tremble before him. What more can you ask for. Dragon Highlord Ariakas deserves the utmost respect even if your 100% good, and i truly believe if they had to kill him off it should have been in a much more honorable way."
2,Not very good,This book was dull and I could barely keep awake to read it. If you have insomnia I would recommend this one but only then. It was a disappointment because most of the others in this series were good.
3,Before the Mask was better,"Well, this book was all right, but I found it inferior to Before the Mask, which told the story of Verminaard Dragonbane. Yeah, Ariakas was cool, but it was too slow and parts were totally pointless. A good book to read if you've already started the series, but don't begin on it."
3,Pretty good....,"An interesting look at one of Krynn's greatest bad guys. A bit slow, but worth reading."
2,HUH? WHERE IS THE REST OF THE STORY!,"... The first 100 pages of this book are fantastic. Then the books takes a boring turn. The rest of the story is boring. The characters are bland, the writing is slow. At the end of the book I was waiting on what would happen next. Didn't Ariakas surround qualinesti. I wanted this covered! Instead we get a boring history of how Draconians came about stretched into over 300 pages. Skip this book!"
4,Mosquito control,"This product helps keep mosquitos in our yard somewhat under control, especially around bromeliads and bird baths. Wish it lasted longer but I appreciate the fact that it doesn't harm the environment or the birds that come to our feeder. I order it at the beginning of mosquito season each year and like that the cost is less than at the plant nurseries."
4,Will try it next summer,My son-in-law is a avid gardener and the mosquito drive him crazy. This will get a thorough test next spring.
5,THE solution for fountains and ponds,"We have a fountain in our front yard. But, it is often turned off due to wind, etc. It was a mosquito breeding ground - no doubt about it. This product was recommended to us by friends who have a fairly large decorative pond off their back deck. They actually gave me some to try before I bought. This works. AND it is safe for wildlife. The birds use our fountain for water and baths, no problem. Our friends have fish in their pond while using this - no problem. It kills the mosquitoes, not the other wildlife.It doesn't take much to do the job - a teaspoon in our fountain every couple of weeks is more than enough. This size container will probably last us for years."
2,product not for me,"I bought Mosquito Dunks several weeks ago and sprinkled some of the bits into my bird fountain where I saw mosquito larvae I came back the following day and still saw the larvae wiggling around in the fountain and so I dumped the water and decided after reading a little closer on the package that it was safe for wildlife, but not safe for my dogs and cats I decided not to use the product anymore. I really don't have anything positive or negative to say about this product because I only used it once and had no results."
4,Good repellent,"Nice repellent for the cost. Little to no smell, which is great if you want to enjoy the yard while it's working. Easy to put down. Works within days. Requires repeat actions after rains or 21 days, whichever comes first. Still looking for the ultimate answer to kill these pesky mosquitoes."
3,Fungus gnats,Did not work as I expected. Had a problems with small black fungus gnats which this product was suppose to control. May have decreased them a little but still have them
3,Mosquito Dunks,"This seems to work all right, but I am not sure if it is safe to have wildlife drink out of the water."
3,quest to enjoy the backyard,"I used this in the wet areas of our lawn a couple times now. It's hard to give an definitive ""yeah"" or ""nay"" on this, but I hope it's helping with the mosquitoes. They're still out there biting us, but we're right near some woods so it'll probably always be a problem. So far, it seems better than past years."
2,Instructions Suggest This Is TOXIC!,"This item is widely marketed as ""non-toxic"" and safe for kids and pets. So I bought a bunch of it to spread around my very swampy lawn. But when I read the instructions, they were filled with warnings to contact poison control if swallowed and to wash thoroughly if the product touches your skin! So maybe this really is non-toxic and the company is just trying to protect itself from liability. Or maybe it really is unsafe. In either event, I can't take the chance with my two-year-olds running around my yard."
2,Dont work..,"Got this product and used it as required..did not seem to work wellat all...went and bought the ""Fogger"" instead and it worked well..Livein Minnesota summers with the bugs..so I know what works and not."
5,For you creatures of the night,"I collect many tarot decks and this one is my favorite.Being drawn to the dark side,I love this deck.Love that it has everything from angels,vampires,egyption,gargoyles and eveything in between.One of the best if not the best gothic deck out there.Even if your not big on tarot readings,I recommend it just for the art work alone."
3,Great cards bad manual,Love the cards. The artwork is beautiful. The cards would be great for doing a reading on myself not sure about using them to do a reading on others.The book is not offer much explaining on the meanings of the cards. I would had prefered a larger book to go with them with more information.
5,Her voice is ocean deep....,Heard the single and without any doubt fell in love with the voice... voice which can easily be predicted to be the voice of generation. We can enjoy the liberty of stating the fact that this voice will travel 7 seas... Azeem & Saba
5,Stopping a Jeep Rubicon,"These are some of the best rotors you can buy for your Jeep. This specific p/n fits the front on Jeep TJ Wrangler Rubicons. Mind you, if you should scroll down and see a ""Frequently Bought Together"" deal with EBC Yellowstuff brake pads (p/n DP41255R), jump on it. You can't do better especially if you wheel your Jeep Rubicon (off road) as I do. The stopping power provided by both these rotors and pads on road and off is exactly what you need (especially if you're running 35"" or less tires. I run 33"" aggressive mud tires)."
5,"It's not really a ""toy"" but a great help in the kitchen","I use this to determine the surface temperature of various cooking surfaces such as a grill or frying pan. It's inexpensive and does the trick quickly. I love it (even if it isn't a ""fun toy"")."
4,"Pretty good, mostly accurate","This product is very easy to use and pretty fun too. I measured the water in my fish tank and it read one degree off of an in-tank thermometer, so it's pretty accurate. Very fun to just play around with, wish it had a laser pointer though so you could see where you are pointing it."
5,Perfect,Works perfect. Have used it to measure the temp of my race car engine. It does a great job and provides very accurate info. Also fits nicley in my small RC toolbox.
3,"good size, lots of use, big mess","The size of this is perfect for my upper elementary and middle school aged kids to work on foot skills in the house. The only problem is that the outer foam leaves all kinds of debris all over the place. Soccer ball crumbs everywhere. Doesn't last long if you have kids that use it nearly daily. Still, it is good while it lasts."
2,"Because, that's YNOT","It took a few listens to YNOT's Cold Beer Hot Food CD before I warmed up to it. The opening track - Just Your Eyes - does not really grab the listener. I skip that and go directly to Valerie, which is a great character study set to music. Each track on the disc is a different style from the rest. Some of the vocals are stronger than others, some of the lyrics intellectual, but the instrumentation is always strong and somewhat eclectic at times. The group YNOT are good, if not great, musicians and Cold Beer Hot Food is an appropriate showcase for that."
3,"it's OK, but Quantity, not quite quality.","Has quite a selection of 70s-80s disco staples, from the likes of quality disco companies (West End, Salsoul, SAM, ect.) 100 songs total. Sounds great, or so it seems.Maybe I'm just a bit spoiled, prefers my music in their full, uncut glory. Of course, averaging out to 25 songs per disc (4 discs) is definitely not expecting 12-inches, but something about the cutoffs / only first 3-4 min. per song, kinda leaves a feelin', well, more of only a ""taste"", incomplete.Would be nice if song length info would be given."
5,TV series Dream On,I liked this show very much when it was airing on HBO. It is really nice to be able to have the dvd of the series and go back and watch them whenever I get a chance. They are funny.
1,Very Unreliable Unit,I have a number of Pioneer units. This player lasted only for about three months and then deck 1 broke. It started stopping the tape just after a few seconds of playing. The same thing happened to rewinding.Cleaning or changing a tape did not help.I had thought that investing into Pioneer meant investing into high quality and long lasting products. Apparently it was a huge mistake. Neither the high price or the name make a difference.I realized that buying Pioneer was a waste money. In future I will go with a cheaper price becasue the outcome might be just the same.
3,A first step to an important task,"A very important contribution to tell an almost unknown story by cinematographic means, but methodically partially unsound. Shows horrible pictures and gives an important insight in the criminal inner life of communism, but as a viewer quite often you can't judge the nature of the shown pictures. So I don't regret that I bought it but I hope there will be better documentations in the future to show the vicinity of communisn and nazism and the horrible qualities of the soviet system."
5,Enlightening reading,I enjoyed this book very much. The author has had an interesting life and I enjoyed walking with her through her self-discovering journey. As I read the book it made me reflect on my own life and it also made me realize that we never know where a person has been during their life's journey. We may encounter them at a particular point in time but we are a composite of all our experiences. It is difficult to put down and it has a happy ending. ENJOY!
5,Bang for your buck!,"We started out with one chair. Then we ordered a few more. Now we haveEIGHT around our S. S. table and they're PERFECT. There's absolutely noupkeep to them and keep in mind, you CAN use them outside. If your budgetonly allows for one type of chair, this is it. You won't be sorry!!!!""Annie"""
3,aluminum navy chair,Finish did not go with table so I returned them.Finish ok... a bit bright and construction light... a good and a bad
4,Girlfriends' Guide to Money,"Nice book with lots of helpful information (e.g., charts, tables, lists, etc). The target audience seems to be women in their 20's and as I'm in my 30's I still found it helpful. It's a good beginner book.Aside from financial stuff, it's motivating and somewhat inspirational -- but not obnoxiously so.A great gift for a any youngish woman (or guy) who has just graduated, gotten a first professional job, or needs a little push to get financially organized."
5,Great for any woman!!,Summers is great at introducing her topics in a manner that is not overwhelming. Plus she gives great tips and facts to back up why you should take care of your finances. An excellent read for a recent college grad or your mother.
3,Not for every dog,"The pad fit our Dogloo perfectly. It was ample in padding. However, it lasted less than one hour. The pad was for our older dogs who are somewhat sedate. We have a one year old cattle dog who got into the pen and summarily destroyed the pad by digging at it. I did not catch her in time to limit the damage. So, if you have a digger/chewer this pad is not the one for you."
4,"Good product, but misidentified here","Durability of this item has been an issue with some customers, but should hold up if covered (as opposed to allowing the pet to scratch/chew while laying on the bare vinyl). My main issue is there is an ID problem on this page. The Doskocil #29816 Dogloo pad is an EXTRA Large (not Large). The Large size is Doskocil #29796. See the Petmate/Doskocil Catalog at: [...] at page 12."
5,"One of the best, and underrated albuns of the 70's","I found this album, on vynyl, in a newstand (!), in 1996, and paid no more than US$ 2,00. And, what a incredible album. The line-up contains great musicians, like Bobby Caldwell (from Captain Beyond and Armagedon), and special guests like Joe Walsh and his band. This album contains two hits of Derringer: ""Rock and roll hoochie-coo"" and ""Uncomplicated"", and others terrific songs. Of course, i bought the CD after that."
3,"Nice for a couple of songs, not much more","Rick Derringer / All American Boy: This has a little good stuff in it, mainly when Derringer plays guitar, which isn't often enough. Most of the songs are just ok.Three Stars"
3,Put out to capitalize on his guitar hero status of the time,"Rick had a fast growing reputation as a top guitarist of the time, 1974. The timing of this release was perfect to capitalize on his popularity. Only problem was even though the timing of the release was perfect the music was not. It shows a rushed effort to get something out and about the only thing good I can say about it is it does give us a lot of Rick's guitar work. Because of the perfect timing and single ""Rock & Roll Hoochie Koo"" the album was a big success. But the overall quality of the album may have hurt his future sales. The songs all could have used more seasoning but maybe the biggest problem was the production, it is not a very well produced album. Recommended only for those looking for great guitar playing."
4,WHERE IS THE LIVE ALBUM?,"This is a decent album perhaps most remembered for the leadoff track, Derringer's classic version of ""Rock and Roll Hootchie Koo"" I just want to know why Epic/Blue Sky hasn't put out the DERRINGER LIVE album from 1977 on CD. I have 2 vinyl copies and they are both beat to hell. Every song on ALL AMERICAN BOY pales when held aganst that album, especially ""Teenage Love Affair."" It just rocks so much harder and with more feeling then any of Derringer's studio albums. If you like this album, try to find a used vinyl copy of LIVE. you might never listen to this one again!"
5,"Great print. (By the way, here is info on the right cable)","Not much to add to what the others have said. This is a great printer. It is very fast in B&W mode, does great color and is still reasonably fast when printing color. I have mine setup with letter size paper in one bin and envelopes in the other. The driver automatically picks the correct bin. About that cable: If you are going to hook up to a printer port (which you can do in addition to the network connection) you will need the DB25 to micro centronics cable, not the regular centronics. These are typically called A-C printer cable. I am using a Belkin F2A045-10."
1,Buyer Beware - This model discontinued,"I was about to shell out for this printer - it sounds great, however the hp support site lists it as discontinued and no longer sells supplies for it."
2,A loser from zyliss,"Zyliss makes great kitchen products but this one is disappointing. Yes, it will julienne while ""peeling"" but it is very uncomfortable to use and get any kind of consistent results. The whole concept is a bit goofy. How do you julienne the whole vegetable while holding it as if peeling? If you want a few strands of julienned vegetable, its fine, but the julienne peeler will really only serve for decorative purposes.The thing that bothered me most is that its so attractive and well packaged that you want to own it, but it really doesn't do much nor does it work well."
5,Cutest ever!,This is so adorable! My 6 year old girl loves these and I want to collect them for myself! The detail is amazing and the tiny pieces are so fun and realistic. This is toy that will keep forever. Well worth the extra money! We want to collect more and my girls love them!
5,Unbelievable details!,"This product, along with all other critter corner products, is amazing! There are so many little details that you wouldn't expect for a childs toy. The drawers all open, the food scale pushes up/down, there is little toast for the toaster, aprons for the parents, cookie sheets and little cookies, food/veggies for the fridge, even ice cream/butter/bottles. my 4 y/o daughter loves playing with little pieces and these sets keep her busy for HOURS! I would recommend ANY of the Calico Critter products to anyone."
4,Cute but ...,"Cute and fun for kids, but watch out for all the teeny tiny pieces...Some were so small that my granddaughter lost some in the carpeting."
4,Nice set but...,"My daughter loves this kitchen set, except for one thing. The doors and drawers are very difficult to open. The little handles aren't really graspable--they just slip right out of your fingers. I may have to glue on small beads to make it possible for her to use all the storage without major frustration. As it is, she has to upend things to get their doors and drawers open...which makes everything fall out, of course. I can't blame her for being frustrated. This is a shame for something so otherwise nice."
5,Great easel!,"Great little, portable easel!. I'm using this mainly for display within my home. It's a great quality easel... compact, yet seems very sturdy."
2,Evel Knievel Yes! This DVD No!,"I have always liked this movie. It stars George Hamilton in the role of Evel Knievel. Actual Footage of Evel Knievel jumps are included in this biographical story. Perhaps the most famous of his jumps is the one from Ceasar's Palace in Las Vegas, it is included here in all of its busted up glory.The only reason I have not to buy this movie is the horrific transfer to DVD. A bad scratchy print was used, washed out color, no state of the art sound and it is not in the widescreen format. Maybe someday a good transfer will be made, until then I wouldn't get your hopes up on this one!"
3,"Fun, typical early 70's ""road"" film","I saw this in a theater, for a ""children's matinee""(the original version had some racey stuff in it,and it may have carried an R or at least cautious PG rating, but other versions were edited for the kiddie market), it only ever seemed to play 2nd run in smaller theaters(and 2nd billing at Drive Ins) between 1971 and '73. VERY typical of early 70's filmmaking when just about anyone could make an indie film and get it easily distrubuted to ""theaters and drive-ins near you"".This low-end DVD sadly, maybe from the only copy available-on faded 16mm-it is on several other ""public domain"" labels(""Public Domain"" is when a film falls out of copyright because it's been edited different ways by different distributors and theaters and the original makers simply lose track of it, or disown it altogether). Still it is a product of it's time. They don't make'em like this anymore! A fun ""road"" movie from a more fun and carefree time."
2,A timeless video,"My purchase and delivery of the VHS movie "" Evel Knievel "" was easy and prompt . However , I disliked the product because the video reproduction was faint and grainy (poor). Also , the sound reproduction was very noisey,cracking and had blank spots (terrible) ! I've enjoyed similar products from indiviguals selling a ""used"" movie , more than this unopeneditem ! My rating is up because the original film is very entertaining ! !"
2,Not So Hot,"This movie is mainly showing Evel's cocky, crazy and rude character. It only shows a few little clips of a few jumps and the viewing quality is very poor. Also some of the movie is filmed at dark and is so blurry that you can't make out what is going on. There is also quite a bit of cursing on this movie. Save your money and get a differant version."
4,Great Live,"I saw Pale Green Pants for the first time last night in Bend,Oregon, and it was great. There is a combination of Jazz with a twist of funk. It is music you can get your groove on to. At a moment, it was like you could here the Dave Matthews Band. I would highly recommend buying the CD and seeing them live."
1,worst fighting game ever,all i have to say is dont get the game no matter how much u want because i cant explain how many reasons the game stinks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"I get a bad feeling when ""from the author"" statement is so poorly written","I was thinking of ordering this book because the title and concept sounded interesting... But the section ""FROM THE AUTHOR"" is so trite, so clumsy in articulating a point, and demonstrates such a poor command of grammar and the English language that I am going to pass!"
5,"theory, case study, all in one",This book is perfect for those who want to study about climate responsive design. It contains theory and case study for the topic. It also has sketches that easy to be understood.
4,Osama your mama didn't teach you to behave so I'm comin,"This game rocks don't mind that other reveiwer, this game has some of the best grapics. You can of a blst huntin down these terriosts. Even in the last level you fight 3 terrorists. Yuo can have an RPG and kill all these people up, you have a veraety of guns to kill and hunt, you even get to hunt down Osama."
3,good for medical techlogist,simple and clear picture guide for identifying normal and abnormal cells.
4,Non stop action,Good action packed adventure even if the story line is a bit far fetched. Great knowledge of SEAL tactics and procedure.
2,Kind of Hokey,"As someone that works on the Submarine base at Bangor Wash. and knows the level of security at that base, I find the ease of hyjacking and stealing a Trident submarine, as outlined in the book a bit entertaining, still a bit hard to swallow. I have read a few of Couch's books and frankley, I would have expected more."
2,"May be they taste good, but packaging suck!",I couldn't try any of seeds since they all ended up spilled into Amazon's shipping box. All cans came broken!!! Manufacturer's packaging is absolute disaster! I don't understand how they survive??? Hoping that people just forget to ask for refund? Look elsewhere ...
5,ADORABLE,"THIS OWL IS SO CUTE!!! I THINK IT HAS A DARLING FACE AND EXPRESSION, AND IT MAKES AN AUTHENTIC OWL SOUND - SO USEFUL FOR TEACHING KIDS ABOUT BIRDS AND THE DIFFERENT CALLS THEY MAKE - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
5,Eshams Greatest Hits,"Its his greatest hits thats all, and why does these surveys keep saying these albums are going to be released in 2000, I've had all these since like 95"
1,WEAK,"THIS GUY IS SSOOOOOOOO WACK IT HURTS.....HE RECYCLES SO MANY LINES AND EVERY ALBUM OF HIS THAT YOU BUY HAS THREE TO FOUR DUPLICATE TRACKS FROM THE ALBUM BEFORE JUST WITH A DIFFERENT BEAT. ITS RIDICULOUS....WHAT ARE THEY PAYING HIM FOR. HE DOESN'T EVER COME WITH ANY NEW MATERIAL....HIS KKKILER FETUS ALBUM HAD NUMEROUS RECYCLED SONGS FROM THE CLOSED CASKET ALBUM AS DID THE GOTHAM CITY CD.....JUST LIKE THE HELLTER SKELLLTER ALBUM , AND ALL OF HIS SUBSIQUENT ALBUMS FOLLOWED SUIT....HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE GIVING HIM 5 STAR REVIEWS, I HAVE LOST ALL HOPE IN HIP HOP. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ORIGINALITY."
3,Amazing Blues Guitarist Releases Some Of His Worst Songs,"The songs on this simply don't measure up to the sheer quality fans know that Joe Louis Walker is capable of producing. Very disappointing. However, this stands as a pretty okay album."
4,Guidelines that work,"An easy read. This book gives some AA history but mainly focuses on the Oxford groups pamplet ""How to listen to God"". I am now using this method with my sponsees and I am seeing results in my life.Though this is a great recovery book it is not limited to people in recovery.A boon for anyone looking for a better conection to God.Diana L"
5,"Great writing, with energy and imagination","If you want a book that you will enjoy reading from the beginning to the end, then McKays Island is one of those books! I highly recommend."
3,"pretty music, not particularly festive","This is beautifully done, but many songs are not familiar. This does not sound especially Christmasy."
2,Beware the LEGO Scorpion,"I bought this LEGO toy because we've had several MegaBlocks sets and they fall apart over and over again as you build them. I hoped LEGOs would be better, but they're not. When built, the fortress stands only 12 inches by 12 inches, so the scale is small and you can't really play with it, given the fact that one wrong move sends the whole thing crumbling. My son is 7 and an experienced LEGO user, but even he said, ""Oh, man! This is as bad as MegaBlocks."" This is going to end up in our LEGO box as spare parts, which is sad considering we paid $39.99 for it."
2,Disappointing compared to other Legos,"Lego is our favorite toymaker, but they really cut corners on this one. The structure looks great and has lots of features, but be careful not to blow on it, or it's coming down! Much too fragile to play with. Evidently they wanted to keep the piece-count down in order to reduce the price point. My son raided his other Lego sets in order to put in supporting pieces, and we stuck the whole thing on a green base plate; still, it's very fragile."
5,"An enchanting treasure, not to be missed...","Treehouse Chronicles is about much more than building a house in the sky; it is about enjoying life, the importance of being a child no matter what your age, and about the joy of imagination.S. Peter Lewis' captivating text and photographs, T. B. R. Walsh's elegant illustrations, and both authors' how-to (and how-not-to) advice combine to create an unforgettable narrative of the creation of a treehouse. We learn about land, life and love as well. One of the best books of this or any season."
5,Captivating!,"Using as a vehicle the building of a treehouse - actually an elegant domicile high up in the woods - this enchanting book is as much about how to live a life, and the importance of making one's dreams a reality, as its purpose. Simply wonderful, sparkling with illustrations that match the fancy and optimism of the text......this is a treat for any age."
4,be warned,"Just a few things to consider when looking at this particular edition....the text is the same as the other edition (you know, the one the ""look inside"" feature uses), but be aware that this particular cheaper volume does not have any of the maps or illustrations. It is ONLY text. Also, the font looks like an old fashioned typewriter - it's not one of the newer, more commonly used fonts for books. Had I known this to be the case, I would have spent the extra few dollars for the Yesterday's Classics version. The ""look inside"" feature DID indicate it was from the Yesterday's Classics one, so I don't fault Amazon for that at all. It still would have been nice to know, however, that this edition had no illustrations."
1,Do not purchase this book,"This is not a finished book and should not be sold as such. It simply contains incomplete proofs in poor typeset, sometimes with only two lines centered on the middle of a page (when the section ends). Instead of having the illustrations, it has notes to an editor in brackets that say [Illustration: Trojan horse], for example. And I'm pretty sure that the author's name (on the cover) is not supposed to have an upside down question mark. There really must be some mistake that caused this to be sold as a real book that anyone would desire to buy."
1,book,This is a most horrible production for a book. It is not even a real book. It is just some typewritten photocopied pages bound together as an excuse for a book. The photocopied pages are so faint...as if the printer was out of ink...so I could hardly discern what was written. Needless to say I had to return the 'item'...because I can't really call it a book.
4,Great Book!,"Guerber relays the story of Greece in a story-telling style. Her prose is not dry, and made reading this book aloud to my daughter fairly enjoyable. (DD hates school, so does not typically enjoy anything about it!) This particular Guerber is formatted with chapters and an index, contains pronunciation guides, all of which made reading this book a pleasure. Not all Guerbers offered can say the same."
1,WAAAAY TO SMALL,THIS THING IS A JOKE! ITS WAY TO SMALL TO BE CONSIDERED ANYTHING WORTH USING. THE BEST ITS FOR IS FOR FIRST STEP ANAL TRAINING I GUESS. ITS THE SIZE OF A THICK FINGER. NOT THICK OR LONG ENOUGH TO SIMULATE A PENIS....THE PIC IS VERY DECIEVING
2,Subscription??,"Was very disappointed to find that I had to spend $100 a year to look at my photo's, mostly because it is not mentioned anywhere in the listing on Amazon. Sent it back without even plugging it in..."
1,Lifetime = Seven years,"I purchased the Ceiva frame about ten years ago when my daughter went off to college. I remember paying $300 for a lifetime subscription. After several years of non-use we were surprised that our subscription had lapsed. We investigated and were directed to a statement that lifetime meant the shorter of ""frame lifetime"" or seven years.Shame on you Ceiva. Even TIVO grandfathered in the early adopters they mislead with their lifetime subscriptions."
2,Never worked,"The frame was nice and the concept is good, but it never worked. I bought a couple frames, one for a friend and one for my parents. My parents have a phone system in their house with an intercom and everything. The picture frame never worked because it can only upload pictures that are downloaded through a phone line in your house. You have to pay $100/yr for the Ceiva service the frame doesn't support a memory card.The frame that I gave to my friend worked. He said he liked it. I would not buy this frame unless you wanted to pay for a service or if you had a phone system in your house."
2,Would have been good without the required subscription,"I checked this out at a local store and was impressed by the quality of this digital picture frame. Ten years ago I briefly owned a digital frame. Things really haven't changed that much since, except the Ceiva has a nice screen and seems easier to use than previous generations.But it's the subscription that turned me off and made me thing this makes a poor holiday gift (unless you also pay for the subscription rather than forcing your giftee to pay). I think the frame itself probably costs just a few bucks to make, and they charge you almost $150, plus they want to get more money frmo you by charing you a monthly fee. That's just a rip-off to me. (Maybe I'm just too cheap.)These days computers have become so easy to use that even grandmas and grandpas can become experts at using Windows, so I don't really see the benefits of something like this. If they are afraid to turn on a computer, they'll probably be uncomfortable plugging this in, too."
2,Was Happy -- I am no Longer,"I have been a Ceiva subscriber for several years. For some reason, Ceiva decided this year that one month before my annual renewal date they would delete one of my photos and replace it with an advertisement indicating that my subscription is up for renewal. The message indicates that I can remove it by either manually deleting it or renewing. Though I delete this message every day, it comes back the next. It seems as though Ceiva has taken the position that it is acceptable to co-opt some of the limited space on your frame in order to force you into renewing early. If you don't mind this intrusion, Ceiva is for you. I, however, will be looking for a frame that does not require a subscription service."
1,Horrendous customer service--don't buy this!,"We originally had a good experience with a Ceiva we bought for one grandparent, so we bought two more for two other grandparents, and it has been a nightmare! The short story is that neither receiver worked, and after many months of my mother having to take her receiver to friends' houses to test if it worked there, they then refused to let me return the receivers for refunds. When we called, we spent up to an hour on hold, listening to ""...due to heavy holiday call volume..."" messages in February. Emails were ignored. The only refund they gave me was for the service, but not for the expensive receiver. It's a nice idea, but it would be better to get a digital receiver that doesn't depend on service--just load up the pictures, plug it in, and skip the customer non-service."
4,Cool Country Rock,I first bought this album in 1975. Its amazing how after 30 yrs the songs still sound as good as they did way back then. Very good collection of tunes. Half the cd is country and the other half is rock. Total track time is around 30 minutes. Very good music.
3,It's okay.,The book provides some thoughts about each Enneagram Type. The authors share their experience when coaching for each Type. Some of which are useful but some are pretty general. The descriptions of the Enneagram Types are over-simplified. Readers should have some good understanding of the Enneagram before reading this book.
5,A superb book on coaching using the Enneagram,This book is an innovative and invaluable resource for anyone who works with individuals or organizations. Bast and Thomson show how Enneagram-savvy coaches can help others solve personal and business problems in ways that are creative and transformative.
3,colonial expertise on Taiwan?,"I did not know that Prof Tang is an expert on Taiwan. I guess nobody in Taiwan thinks so! This book, briefly mentioning a secondary writer in Taiwan, exactly shows that this book and this scholar are equipped very limited knowledge of Taiwan. It is odd to subjugate Taiwan modernity under Chinese modern. There should be another book on Taiwan modern. I find it horrible that those who do not know Taiwan well can claim any expertise on Taiwan. It sounds so colonial."
5,Great Concert by Terfel and Orchestra,"I've seen Terfel several times and he always blows me away in person. He does so in this concert as well! The orchestra and conducting along with his singing just couldn't be improved upon. A perfectly wonderful concert. The Wagner was beautifully sung and Terfel makes it seem much easier than it is! However, his secret weapon is his ability to communicate, phrase and sing the Broadway show tunes. Each time he performs a selection he makes it new, fresh and his! I loved this DVD and highly recommend it to anyone who loves great music performed by highly trained musicians in a beautiful concert hall. This one is truly special!"
2,"Oh, Bradygames","I was 12 back in 2000 when PE2 came out, and the game's puzzles were a bit too much for me, especially considering I'd only been studying english for a few years. So I got the guide and it got me through the game. If that's all that matters to you, this is a decent guide.If you want good battle tactics, you can do much better on your own. There are much better strategies for taking out some of enemies, bosses included. And you'll need these strats if you're going to tackle the higher difficulties, which this guide doesn't cover one bit.This guide is only good holding your hand through your first play through, or helping you solve the puzzles. If you know Japanese (as I'm sure many of you do!) then give the Japanese books a try. They contain far more useful information"
5,Awesome and Extremely helpful,"This book is the greatest ever, I had my doubts but I was wrong, it was not only helpful but has awesome Pictures as well I highly recommend this book."
5,Awesome!,One word....Awesome! Top of the line in scanners. Well worth the money and very easy to use. I highly recommend this scanner.
4,excellent product owners manual could be more complete,I would have someone buy this scanner but with the purchase of a surge protector that goes under the monitor.
4,Shorter is Better,"In addition to the expect high quality (materials, workmanship) of Calvin Klein clothing, this trunk is shorter in length than standard boxer briefs. I find this shorter design to be more comfortable."
5,Stunningly beautiful and moving!,"As a Christian, I was amazed and moved by the history of the Jewish feasts. We take so much for granted! This book is one of the best devotionals I have ever read, and it educates as well as inspires. For the Christian who wishes to know more about our faith's Jewish ""roots."" Amazing, wonderful, beautiful."
4,Good material,"John Hagee writes as well as he preaches. I've read tons of his books over the years and have never found anything inaccurate or misleading. If you are a Hagee fan, you will enjoy this devotional."
3,Well crafted but watch the little pieces,"My youngest daughter recently discovered the Calico Critters world and was instantly hooked. The bathroom set is as depicted, and I was surprised the detail of some of the accessories (for example the soap even has a separate soap dish).But the pieces such as the toothbrush, shampoo, etc., are really small and are easy to lose, and could swallowed by smaller children.The Calico Critters products are well crafted, but I fully expect many of the cool tiny pieces to get lost soon enough."
5,"""Sex in the City""","Amazingly humorous, this movie is full of hilarious acts of sex while incorporating an amazingly real plot(trying not to give the movie away)! I reccomend this movie to anyone who likes to watch sex along with a few laughs. Once again, get this movie for yourself if you feel like asking me! Jarrett"
1,Ever seen paint dry?,Need I say more? This video has all the excitement of a slow snail race with the added bonus of being absolutely DUMB!
2,Too small,"The pads are too small and wimpy. You have to use two of them at a time. If you double one over, it's the size of a postage stamp."
3,"""Lady"" from this album was in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'",It took me awhile to find this out so I'm sharing the info. The song 'Lady' was played during the 90's version of the movie 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. It was the only song I didn't know and unfortunately it's not on the soundtrack. I used to have this CD but it just wasn't memorable enought except for 'Lady' and 'Black Cat Moan'...it's worth downloading those songs!
5,Super classic rock with a Supergroup,"JEFF BECK is genius and here is in the company of Bogert and Appice from CACTUS. Like all the albums of CACTUS, the tracks seems to be recorded live. Great sound, that make me rembember LED ZEP, and JIMI HENDIX EXP, and also STEVE RAY VAUGHAN. This Supergroup doesn't last too much. This record also has the taste of Chess Records, like the JAM SESSIONS of PETER GREEN FLEETWOOD MAC"
4,great music terrible vocals,Some of the best hard/rock/blues music.Not surprise at all coming from three who were among the best.I wish all songs on this album were instrumentals. Why they didn't get real singer for this masterpiece?
5,Real Classic Album Rock!,"This album was a must-have back in the early 70's while still in high school. My friends & I all had it & played the grooves off it. Every track is great, especially the opening cut ""Black Cat Moan"" & their version of Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition"". Great guitar & drum work throughout, should be enjoyable even to new generations of kids interested in good ol' classic rock!"
2,Why should I care?,"I enjoy listening to two songs on this CD. They are BLACK CAT MOAN & SUPERSTITION. Jeff Beck seems to be enthusiastic about the lead in these songs. On days when I can ignore the vocals, LOSE MYSELF WITH YOU is pretty fun, again because Beck has some interesting work. That is about all the nice things I can say about this album. If you are interested in what Jeff Beck did in 1973, this CD may interest you."
2,not awful,"But it is pretty boring.""Superstition"" is the highlight and you can get it on Best Of Beck."
4,All You Can Eat is Satisfying,Nice balance between eroticism and romanticism. Decently plotted tale. I look forward to checking out more of her work.
2,Surely there are a lot of more beautiful books from Emma Holly...,"I won't stop to buy Emma Holly because I love her books but All U can Eat will be changing hands very soon! Boring, lot of sex and no meaning, a mystery too easy to solve and two forgettable characters..."
5,A success,"I found it wasn't as intense as her previous books, but still very good. It wasn't quite as hot, the scenes seemed less indepth and it focused more on the emotional story. Worth a read for sure!"
2,Disappointing,Great if you want to relax and stretch for 20 minutes but not if you want a workout. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I purchased this.
2,pregnantchik,"I wish I did my homework and read the reviews in this DVD before I bought it! I'm not even in the best of shape, but have been doing yoga for years, and found this DVD way to easy. If anything, it is a good DVD for those days when even getting in 20 minutes of light stretching is a success!"
1,Boring and short,"Boy was I disappointed with this DVD. It is barely 20 minutes and is not much of a workout no matter what trimester you are in. If you never worked out before your pregnancy then this might be good for you, but if you worked out regularly don't even bother with this one. It is just some stretching & neither of the women are even pregnant. I will not use this DVD as a regular part of my prenatal workout routine."
3,"Ok, but not enough on its own","So, I did the prenatal portion of this dvd this morning. Other reviewers are correct - it is not a great workout. It IS a pretty good stretch. 20 minutes long, the two women go through a series of poses and moves (some of which feel more like yoga than pilates) to help loosen you up and (supposedly) strengthen your core.Would I like it better if the women were actually pregnant? ABSOLUTELY! I found it a bit annoying to be 7 months pregnant, big bellied, and following these skinny women. One woman was doing beginner modifications, the other did more intermediate moves.It was not challenging, and I followed it by doing [b]Crunch: YogaMama[/b], but I think I could have used it as a good stretch before or after doing some cardio, too. And, there are some days when 20 minutes might be just right.So, I would say, it is an ok dvd, but not enough of a workout to really stand alone."
3,Pilates for Life:Prenatal and Postnatal,I used to work 5-6 days a week prior to becoming pregnant and my doctor advised me to slow down while I am pregnant but still continue to exercise. I was excited about the Pilates DVD because it sounded great at first. After I tired I felt like I barely got anything out of it except for a few good stretches. It was barely 20 min long for the exercise portion because the introduction portion is included in this time. If you have not exercised prior to being pregnant this may be the DVD for you.
1,Not so great,These movements were far too simplistic and did not produce any real results other than removing it from the DVD player.
2,Fine for a gentle warm-up to start your day,Let me keep it short like this workout... The workout is only 20 minutes long. It would be nice to watch pregnant women doing the workout. The DVD is fine if you just want a gentle warm-up before another workout or to start your day. Best to save your money and buy a different DVD.
5,BEAUTIFUL,"Beautiful artwork and imagery on these cards. They are very pretty indeed.The meanings included in the 'little white book' could be a bit more detailed, but all in all it is a lovely deck of cards."
4,Madame Endora Cards,"This is not a tarot deck (it hasn't major and minor arcana). It has a beautiful and aeclectic artwork; some cards as the queen, the king, the oracle and the moon hace aegyptian inspiration; there are some creatures from greek mythology, as the sphynx, medusa, the siren and the satyr. Other cards, as the four elements and the hand of fate have a cabalistic look. Other cards have celtic inspitation.Each card shows at the bottom a brief description or a phrase that aids in its interpretation, so it's a deck suitable for beginners. It's also a different kind of deck if you want to try something ""less traditional"""
5,"Easy to learn, beautifully illustrated!","I finally ordered this set of cards through Amazon and was not disappointed. This is NOT tarot, but work much the same way. It is a great way to introduce fortune telling into your life. The art is very nice. The images are easy to memorize, this is not really required, the cards speak for themselves.(literally, the meanings are written on the cards)I really admire the deck's artistry, especially the backs. It is as if the cards came from some time forgotten cabinet of curiousities. The feel is geared toward gothic style interpretation without totally leaning on the dark side. The deck's big brother Gothic Tarot is much more serious, as this deals with the classical archetypes directly. Madame Endora could almost be consided a new ager. There is nothing wrong with this at all!This deck could be easily used by children at a sleep overs and not cause too many nightmares. It is a great place to begin for the amature to turn professional."
4,Good Product!,I received this deck on a timely fashion. I bought this used but it was in really good condition the art is beautiful but the meanings are short. All in all I have no complaints. Good product.
5,Great collection to own,"Recently discovered this old band. Music is great and has a smooth, jazzy, downtempo feel to it. This is a great collection to own."
2,So so,"I love Jane Powell and Elizabeth Taylor. I'll watch them in anything. But their characters are so bratty in this movie it was almost torture. As far as romance goes Jane Powell and the other boy, don't have chemistry. It feels like Jane is forced into the situation.But there are a couple of things to recommend. Carmen Miranda sings a couple of numbers and plays a dance instructor. Xavier Cugat, like in the better previous Holiday in Mexico, comes to the high school to perform a number, as if. It kind of undermines what a famous musician he was. The most curious of all things in this movie is Elizabeth Taylor's number. Maybe the studio wasn't exactly sure about her appeal yet but she sings a song in this. She lipsyncs and it's generic but still that's surprising enough. But she was declared the prettiest girl in the movie so at least they were aware of something."
4,Simply Fun,"Judy Foster (Jane Powell) has a happy teenage life. Her boyfriend Oogie (Scotty Beckett) is a bandleader at her school and his sister Carol (Elizabeth Taylor) is her best friend. Her father (Wallace Beery) and mother have a great relationship. However, to make himself seem irresistable, Oogie stands Judy up at a dance. The plan backfires and she brings an older man named Stephen Andrews (Robert Stack) for her date. She then toggles between Oogie and Stephen, although Carol has eyes for Stephen as well. On top of it all, Judy suspects her father is cheating when she mistakes his dance teacher (Carmen Miranda) for his mistress.This movie is strictly fun and nothing more, but with such a great cast, how could you complain? The girls are absolutely beautiful and obviously talented. Powell sings several songs including the memorable ""It's a Most Unusual Day."" Miranda is much more subdued here than in most of her movies, and therefore is more tolerable. She has a few numbers too."
5,memories,this film just brings back memories of my teen age years they were a little corny by today's standards but beatiful singing songs and clothes.I loved jane powell and most of her leading men i.e.ricardo moltalban vic damone etc .I think I would write this review for all of jane powell's films now now I am in my twilight years I sit and watch them over and over again .Thank you Amazon for being able to get them as I have wanted them for years
3,Corny but very cute!,"A 40's teen movie starring a young Jane Powell and a blossoming beautiful Elizabeth Taylor! Jane has a wonderful voice and sings ""Love Is Where You Find It"" and ""It's A Most Unsual Day"" while having a massive crush on older man Robert Stack. Her fanciful ways along with Carmen Miranda, Xavier Cugat, and Wallace Beery antics add to the charming confusion but all misunderstandings evetually get cleared up for a happy musical ending."
3,"Description is incomplete, this is twist-on connector for RG-213 cable","It is hard to see from picture and description for which cable this is. These connectors are screw-on types for RG-213 cable. Based on type, these aren't very heavy duty and resistant to elements or twisting forces, so I suggest to limit their usage for indoor use only."
4,Lifesource UA-774ac Blood pressure monitor,"This unit is a two person setup; it works well to keep track of a 30 test average. It does not allow you to review each individual reading of the 30 test average; you must keep a written log if you need that, or if you want to see an am versus pm reading. It appears to be accurate when the cuff is applied properly; at first I was putting it on to loosely causing a elevated diastolic pressure reading, but when tightened a little more my reading was accurate. Monitoring your blood pressure can motivate you to make changes in life style and help you to change bad habits. Through monitoring, deep breathing, relaxation, diet and exercise, I have been able to lower my cholesterol and my blood pressure and at 59 no longer take any medication at all. It was hard work but very rewarding."
4,Great machine!,We love this monitor. Both of us can record our results. It has worked very well for us. We checked it against regular BP cuff and the results were about the same. Good product.
2,The 25 Thunderous Classics,Just not as good as I expected it to be. Some of the selections are too short and not as thunderous as one would expect from the title.
5,Profiler DVD series,"Fantastic series. It's sort of a cheesy horror version of Law and Order, but I was hooked enough after watching the first season that I requested the rest of the series for a birthday gift."
3,Works great,"Perfect for a small home office. Also, must more reasonably priced than the larger size that holds an entire 8.5x11 sheet of paper."
3,More like a stretching video than pilates...,"The first thing to note is that this video definitely does not come with two workout levels. I completed the beginner level and decided to immediately move on to intermediate and it was the exact same thing!I don't know a lot about what makes a workout considered pilates, but I do know this was nothing like any of the pilates classes or videos I have followed -- very little ab or glute work. I think with regular use this video will 100% improve your flexibility, but as far as getting a great workout I'd definitely pass. I really don't see how this 20-minute stretching routine will tone anything in your body. Overall I'd say it's a nice post-workout video to relax and stretch your muscles."
4,20 min workout,A great mini workout. I was happy to see that there was a beginners and intermediate level. The instructor is calm and explains things well.
5,A Delightful Book,"Watching the expressions of my adult children and my grandchildren as they read this story was wonderful. Smiles all around. That Ms. Schulz could put in writing what we have all experienced with ""man's best friend"" was an excellent accomplishment. The vocabulary and sentence structure are perfect for the ""rookie reader."" The illustrations were unique to the story. MORE!!! I just may go to the shelter to find a dog of my own. HUNTSVILLE, Al."
3,it works,not super impressed with the detail of the directions but it gets the point accross. I wouldn't suggest for someone not mechanically inclined.
4,Very Good Performance Once You Get Set-Up Figured Out,"I recently puchased and installed the HP 630 multi-function unit in my home office. The set-up went fine--with all set-up prompts clear and straight forward. However, I did have significant difficulty loading paper for the first time. The guides on the back are very tight and at first would not allow letter size paper to fit. It took about 10 minutes to figure out how to load paper by squeezing the guides to open them up which surprised me a little. The unit works great now though--I have printed checks from Quicken and other routine stuff without a hitch. One key thing: once you have it set up be sure to call the HP 800 number and they will send you a test fax right away--a great feature. All in all--looks like it will be a terrific machine for the price."
2,Dissatisfaction unlimited with HP Officejet 630,"My employer provided me with a new HP Officejet 630. I work out of my home.It worked for the first 3 months, then began the continueing problems with receiving faxes, printing, copying. HP tech support worked with me for many hours, unable to solve problem of blotching faxes, faxed letters would print only the letterhead, printingwas smeared, faint, non existant. HP finally sent a replacement, it worked for 2 days before it's problems became worse than the original. Tech personnel can not overcome the design problems with this machine. I am buying a replacement from another manufacturer."
5,My favorite book ever,"I must have read it over a dozen time (in French) since I was 15. Can't comment on the translation, but I just wanted to say the original is truly a masterpiece. I want to live and wait at the fortress, forever."
1,humanmancalvin,"Sub-par product, wasted my money. After printing & attaching product to bumper of car it stretched totally out of shape. feel ripped off!"
2,very thin -- not 15mil,"Bought this because I needed a thick backlit material, and it is supposed to be 15mil, while most others are 5 - 10. It is not even close to 15, maybe 5 at most -- very thin and flimsy. Probably what most people want, but totally mislabeled."
2,Caution.,"Like most of the critical writing that is accruing about McCarthy's work these days, reading these essays invites the observation that academic commentary on great works of literature all too often appears as a perverse sort of alchemy, an attempt to tranform bronze into excrement. While merely vexatious for those familiar with McCarthy's work, these institutionally sanctioned forms of obfuscation, however well-meaning, are a tremendous dis-service to the uninitiated. McCarthy's ambition is biblical, ungodly; thus, his work is robustly defiant -- even scornful -- of contemporary professional exegesis."
3,Needs replaceable eraser,"Little hands erase all of the time and before we know it the eraser is gone on the pencil and we have all of these huge pencils not getting used. Literally a whole flower pot, full of wood and lead not getting used. We do use the regular pink eraser on the side, but it would be nice if Ticonderoga would make erasers to fit on the end of the My First."
1,Yuck! Microban!,"It's my own fault for not reading the product description closely enough, but I never would have bought these pencils for my preschooler if I had been able to see the Microban tag in the picture. It's ironic, too, that they have it because the box arrived open and beat up and the pencils are all dirty inside. So much for the chemicals that prevent them from getting stained. Overall I am disappointed with this purchase and will probably return it."
3,Good and Bad,Bad: For the NINTH season in a row-NO subtitles or even close captions.Good: WIDESCREEN ALL season LONG!
4,Degrassi: The Next Generation Season 9,"I love this season, Pack of drama It came together so fast I didn't have time to wait for it to pick up."
4,Pretty good for a collector,As a collector/fan of the Degrassi series this of course was a must have item. However it didn't have quite the amount of extra features that previous DVD sets have had. I don't know if that is because the distributor has changed or they just didn't have as much material to add to the DVD. Either way it was a little disappointing in that aspect.
5,My Daughter Thinks DeGrassi is the Bomb,My daughter has to have each season as it's put out on DVD. She is addicted to the series and has been ever since I bought her DeGrassi Jr. High. I think the series gives youth options for dealing with difficult situations. It shows them the types of values to hold onto and pitfalls to avoid.
2,subtitles?,They don't have subtitles so I can't watch it. The movies should start developing subtitles for other people who can't hear like me. I'm deaf and I would love to watch that t.v. show but can't.
5,Spectacular Jazz Recording,"I have a fairly large collection of jazz CD's, in the 1,200 range. Every once in a while I will run across something during Amazon purchasing and cross-referencing various musicians that truly hits the ""spectacular"" button. This was one of those CD's. I had never heard of Ryan Kisor, Peter Zak nor John Webber, although I was familiar with the drummer, Willie Jones III. What an outstanding CD this is. A few standards and other tunes of an exceptional nature. I love it when I discover something truly great, and since then I have bought a couple other CD's with Risor (beautiful trumpet sound reminding me of Art Farmer) and Peter Zak, a superb jazz pianist. You should definitely buy this CD. It really swings."
2,"Packaging was misleading, NOT what I needed","Maybe I just didn't read the description closely enough, but for the price I was expecting this to come with a tank as well, since it read Reptile Kit, 10 gallon. As it was, it's a few bits and pieces I could have purchased locally and separately for less, and totally unsuitable to my needs, since my son got a Chinese water dragon which requires a heat lamp rather than a heat rock. I'm sending it back, but I have to do it at my own expense, since Amazon says the product not meeting my needs is not their fault."
2,Measures would help customers to make the right choice,"I recently received a 1 meter long green iguana as a gift, and wanted him to have some comfort in his new habitad; nothing in this kit fit his needs, but the vitamins. Adding specific measures, animal size limit, actual pictures of the product (not the package) or any other specifications, instead of only the ""10 Gallon"", that would help customers have a much better idea of the product before buying.Zoo Med Reptile Habitat Kit, 10 Gallon"
4,Nice Story~,Erica Brant had traded places with her twin sister as nanny to Will Spencer's children. Her sister had fallen in love with Will but he didn't know she was alive. Will didn't know why he suddenly started seeing his children's nanny in a new light but thought that he had found the woman of his dreams. Erica hadn't planned on falling in love with Will but she had....but how could she break her sister's heart?~I found this to be a sweet and warm story.
4,From the Back Cover,"Web of Passion...The feelings Dirk Lancaster, outb ack lord, raised in Risa were enough to leave her aching for his touch. Yet to be the woman he needed would challenge her as nothing had before.This Land of torrential rains and dry spells of searing intensity would reshape Risa into a woman open to life, ready for love, and ripe for the one man who could tame her heart and master the ragine sun.From the inside...""I despise you Dirk,"" Risa murmered, ""more than I can say.""""What's that got to do with wanting me?""""All I want is for you to leave this room right now, and never enter it again while I'm here.""""Let's put it this way,"" Dirk amended with a taunting smile. ""I'll only come in by invitation.""You won't get invited. Make no mistake about that.""We'll se,"" he said as he turned toward the door. ""We'll see."""
3,Powerful,"This is a reliable product, but you better have a large bowl! I learned the hard way, when I turned it on the lowest speed and my cookie dough sprayed all over. Haven't been able to use it on any other speed. Hard to hold on to. Better to get a base to attach it to."
2,way too powerful,There is no such thing as a slow speed button. The slowest speed is way too fast and throws the food everywhere. I'll be returning it.
1,useless,not worth buying it. Shows some outdated steps which you already do naturally. Nothing to learn.
3,This was not the nightclub dancing I had expected,"This video has introductory disco and slow dancing. If one is looking for beginning non-contact disco dancing, you will probably find this video helpful. The second part of the video features contact slow dancing. The instructors Vicki Regan and Ron De Vito are very capable, leading the viewers step by step. However, because there was no prior reviews of this video, I assumed too much and had thought the video would feature something like the disco hustle, a contact dance, and a slow dance such as the nightclub two step a la Buddy Schwimmer. As they say, buyer beware."
1,Does NOT teach 70's disco dancing at all!,"This item was completely misrepresented by the manufacturer as an item that provides instruction on ""disco"" dancing; however, the only dancing on this tape is 80's and early 90's dancing which is completely hideous. It pains me to even watch this tape because the dancing is so awful. The appropriate title for this video should be ""Dancing for Old Farts on Cruise Ships."" If you're of young age, I would not suggest getting this tape. It is so awful!"
1,Save Your Money!,"This software was very disappointing. The editing features are extremely limited and what templates? You could get the same or better results by ""cut & paste"" from job search websites to MS Word. I would not recommend this overpriced program."
5,polka dot sleeve,it's a great sleeve for protecting your laptop computer. material is of neoprene so it's sturdy and waterproof. would highly recommend this for all laptop owners.
5,Soft and pleasing to the eye,"Got this for my daughter to house her iBook (13"") for Christmas. It fits great, has great padding and is very attractive so she'll use it. It's a fun way to protect a very expensive item!"
2,Make sure you know what your getting before ordering,"i bought this book from amazon.ca, and when i got it in the mail, i was very disapointed to find that it was only about 70 pages long and only had a few bars of music for each robert johnson song covered. If you want a book that is very heavy on theory, this is it - but it won't give you the tabs you want, so i would recomend looking into robert johnson the new transcriptions (ISBN: 0793589193). it's a few bucks more, but a way better book.hayden kee"
5,Good Playing All Around,"I got the CD a little while ago, but I still love it. The CD has great songs on it, especially track 4, sing, in which Russell Malone shows his talent at its best. Tale of the fingers, track 2 has a very good melody, a short song, but very fast. Those who like be-bop will like that song. The ballads in the CD are pretty good all around, and the playing is awesome. I would recommend this CD to everyone. If you like this CD you might also like:Bluebird: Benny Green/Russell MaloneRay Brown/Monty Alexander/Russell Malone (Sometimes called Last Session):Ray Brown/Monty Alexander/Russell MaloneSweet Georgia Peach: Russell MaloneStraight Ahead: Monty Alexander/Ray Brown/Herb EllisSome Of My Best Friends Are Guitarists: Ray Brown"
2,Chinese QA strikes again,"I hate to downgrade Merrell as they make great shoes, this being my 4th pair. Tried these on locally and then ordered through Amazon, the 11.5 D(M), I noticed right away the right shoe was more narrow then the left. When I took the insoles out, the right insole had more of an upward curve where the shoe is more narrow. So now my left foot is comfortable and my right one is hanging off the side...Checked and they're both the same size. Oh well, other than that the shoes are nice. Now I am stuck paying twice the shipping and wondering whether or not to reorder or get something else.I wouldn't care too much about quality assurance either if I was being payed 50 cents an hour."
4,shoe review,"Comfortable hiking boot with great support, will work wonderfully for early season hunting adventures and fishing trips. Would recommend to anyone who is looking for a lightweight ankle high hiking shoe."
5,Merrel Moab is great,"The pair of boots that i ordered are great. These boots are a good summer boot. One of the best ventilated boots i have ever worn. First pair of boots that i have ever worn that do not make my feet sweat. Additionally these boots are also awesome because even if the do get wet they are so well ventilated that they dry out really fast, within a couple of hours. I highly recommend these boots they are comfortable as regular shoes but get the job done when hiking."
5,comfortable solid boots,"I got alot of guff for ordering boots online without checking them out beforehand. Turns out, I get the last laugh! These boots are great! They're solid and comfortable. I wear them all day everyday and they hold up."
4,good traction in dry terrain or floor. slippery in wet floor.,"the shoes are very comfortable, has very good grip on dry stone, good traction on almost any terrain. the feet are kept dry and cool, not as a sneaker or running, but it shows that lets out transpiration. I have 2 months of use with shoes and seem straight out of the box, they are also beautiful. What we do need to be careful is on wet floors, the sole becomes slippery and can generate a fall."
2,Check your size,"Size not true to US standards. I bought them as a gift for my husband. The pair received was at least a 1/2 size smaller that he usually wears. As these were sent to an APO/AE military address, I was not able to return them. I guess no more ordering shoes over the internet."
3,Okay,"These shoes are great! Only downside being that they fit big and loose, if I buy again I would go down 1/2 size."
5,A perfect DVD for trips!,"My son loves watching the Boohbas dance, and he thoroughly enjoys story people time. However, whenever the ""Look What I Can Do"" portion of the show starts, he becomes instantly bored and either leaves the room or starts crying. When we're watching Boohbah on TiVo, we always have to click past that part. Well the beauty of this DVD is that none of the three episodes on it have the ""Look What I Can Do"" part! Instead, it's included on the disc as a separate bonus feature. Better yet is the fact that there's a ""Play All"" option which plays each of the three episodes in succession, which is even more convenient than TiVo, and makes this disc wonderful for long trips in the car or on the plane if you've got a portable DVD player. I just ordered the other Boohbah DVD today!"
5,Kids love it.,My 2 year old twins love Booh-Bah and especially this episode. They find the humor in the strong willed little dog that persists in sitting in the Comfy Armchair. The simpleness of the storyline entertains them. The love the color and the movement.
5,Strange but effective,The cousins of the teletubbies look quite like male genitilia and one dosent know if you are amazed or horrified. I have to say that when my daughter goes into a behavior this tv show will 90% assist in cooling her down. I recomend it. Even throw a party with your adult friends and have it the background.
4,A complex read,"The Idea of Design is more the philosophy of design than anything else. It's true benift that is great for anyone in industial/graphic design and architechture is that it show a variety of view points. Romantics often get so caught up in their own vision they fail to see things from a different perspective. From reading the book I have learnt two very important lessons. (1) The most brilliant design resides in nature. Try as we will, our insight to solve one problem leads us to an ocean of social, economical and environmental difficulty. (2) In the past lies a higher understanding in which we often ignore. Before one creates, the designer must contemplate the change it will make in culture/society. This why studying a variety of different perspectives is imperative. Social responsiblity is hopefully making a comeback. Extremely interesting points are made in the essays, bearing in mind that you can grasp the daunting complexity of often abstact ideas."
2,Bah!,"Good for overintellectualizing and pontificating idealistic principles of design; bad for any concrete examples. Sure, fanciful ideas of design's capacity to revolutionize social, environmental and cultural change is a splendid idea, but I'll need you to show me something that manages to accomplish that first. And hold all the airy, abstracted philosophical fluff please!"
2,mediocre,"David Essex's debut album hasn't aged well: ""Rock On"" is still a moody, unsettling gem of a song, but other tracks here are unfocused. His best albums were still a few years off at this point."
5,David Essex #1 fan,"In My eyes (and ears) he can do no wrong, I have followed his films and songs since school days in England, sat thru night after night of Evita in my teens. Recently on a trip back to the UK even watched his Christmas pantomine with my own daughter but Rock On is still the classic, lamplight and the best of, are also very good but if you are a fan, this album (sorry CD) Rock ON and that front cover are worth adding to the collection....Rock on David.P.S. The movie is still a good buy too !"
2,One Song Wonder,"I have a radio program on which I feature an album a week. I had a request for ""Rock On"" and my vinyl wasn't in very good shape. The only good song on the album is the title song, ""Rock On."" The rest of the album is pure junk."
3,Rock On Lives On!,"I love the song ""Rock On"" by Essex.It's unmatched in soundscape and somehow it keeps the rock n' roll spirit alive and well once turned up at a maximum volume."
2,One Song Syndrome,"Bought this years ago. The song Rock On was pretty cool. The rest of the disk was nonsense. Pick it up at the library, listen and then take it back. Not worth paying for."
2,"Good Movie, Terrible DVD Production","The movie itself is great. It's funny with some great performances from brilliant actors. The producers of the DVD however have ruined the picture with very poor image quality, the worst I have seen in any reproduction of movies from that era. In addition, the ""delta"" insignia flashes on and off the screen intermittantly, distracting you from the show. The introduction and end comments from Tony Curtis are poorly edited in to the movie itself taking from the movie experience. Get the movie but not this version!"
3,i bet they all had fun making this one,"john huston and humphrey bogart team up yet again for this noir spoof about smugglers caught in a place they cant escape from, with robert morley in the sydney greenstreet role, and peter lorre in the peter lorre role. probably more fun if youre a bigger fan of the genre than i am, and sadly the print is not in the best of shape, so ive taken away one * as a penalty."
2,Better Than Nothing...,"I'm a fan of movies, serials, and TV shows based on comic-book characters. When I discovered ""Dick Tracy: Saga of a Crimefighter"", I was excited. Here were the original 15 chapter serial, the four RKO movies, several episodes of the Ralph Byrd TV series, and a documentary, all packaged together. Unfortunately, the quality of the DVDs themselves wasn't worth the price. The box art is the best part of this set, which include 3 slimcases in a cardboard sleeve. I don't know what was used as source material for these DVDs, but they appear to be poor VHS transfers. I gave ""Dick Tracy: Saga of a Crimefighter"" 2 stars because, if you are a collector, it is better than nothing. But if you want good transfers, the RKO Dick Tracy double-features by Critic's Choice are digitally restored. Get these, forego the documentary, and wait on the upcoming VCI Dick Tracy serial release.Dick Tracy Double Feature #1,Dick Tracy Double Feature #2."
2,An alarmist position,"This book presents a very alarmist view about the implications of technology for privacy. I found it to be one sided, for example, bad things that technology might develop are presented but good things that counter them are not presented. It will appeal to those who are looking for pessimism about technology but those who are looking for the pros and cons of technology developments will be disappointed."
2,"skip this one - buy ""designing women"" instead","okay, i admit it, i am a design book junkie. this book, however, definitely does not do justice to the designers or their homes. in fact, the photos are adequate, not nearly on the same level of sophistication of ""designing women"" by russell - which is a terrific book on some really terrific interior designers. ""designers in residence"" mirrors the editorial content of the magazine which produced it - ""victoria"" - of which i am not a fan. if you want an inside tour of some very talented designers - buy ""designing women"" instead."
4,nice little toy,"it was kind of tall for the dollhouse bedroom, but worked in the open upstairs part, and hold two people, so thatwas good...my granddaughter had fun with it"
5,Nice addition to overall purchase,"I got this little bunk bed to go along with my Christmas purchase for our 3 yr old daughter. I got the cozy cottage which came with one critter and one bed. I added the Peaches and Freddy Swing n Play because it had two little critters with it...then they needed a bed and this bunk bed is PERFECT! Although it is a little tall for the upstairs in the Cozy Cottage, it doesn't have all the extras the other bedroom sets come with and that is a good thing since the Cottage is on the smaller side. The bunk bed can easily be set up as two single beds if your little one prefers. I'm so glad I got this along with the two tiny critters, because it is important to my 3 year old that everyone have a place to sleep. :)"
4,S'okay,These beds are better used apart than together. They are smallish for the Critters and the ladder doesn't stay on well but my daughter still enjoys them.
4,You can never have enough beds.,"I was very happy to find these bunk beds. It seems that dollhouses never come with enough beds, and it's hard to find extra beds for sale. Usually they come with an entire room, which is furniture we don't need, and too expensive.We bought the bunk bed to add to a Fisher Price house. The beds are nice because they are rather small, so will fit into almost any of the dollhouses we have, including some older Little People houses. The Calico Critters fit in them just perfectly.The beds can stack to be a bunk, or be taken apart for 2 twin beds. The bed itself is made out of boring beige plastic, but each has a fabric covered mattress, blanket and tiny pillow that help dress it up.Bottom Line - if you're looking for beds, buy this bunk bed set."
4,bunk bed for critters' house,"It is pretty much as pictured, but not as substantial as I had anticipated. It will go with the little house, and my little grandsons will enjoy it, I am sure. It was purchased for a gift. Promptness of shipment, and accuracy was great."
5,Ally's birthday gift,"Along with the Calico Critters Carry Case and a few rooms of furniture, I purchased the little bunk beds for the twin rabbits. The bunk beds are very well made and can be used as a bunk bed or two twin beds. The detail on the beds is nicely done and they are very cute.My daughter loves how small and detailed the furniture is and enjoys hours of playtime with the bunk beds. Anyone who has Calico Critters would love these."
4,"Great show, but WRONG set","I almost ordered this collection, but then noticed another set (also through Amazon, linked below) that had a bonus disk. Disk 35 includes the three ""Law & Order"" crossover episodes, and ""Homicide: The Movie"", which ties up many loose ends.Without the bonus disk, this collection isn't truly complete, and thus rated only 4 stars. TheHomicide 35-disk megasetis worth the extra bucks, and an extra star.(PS: A special thanks to Mr. Bey (Riverside, CT United States), whose review of this set tipped me off about the missing crossover episodes and led me to search out the megaset I now own and enjoy)EDIT: I purcahsed the Megaset in July 2007 for $112.42. Now the price has jumped to $340 +. It's a good show, but I doubt that I would have paid anything over $200.00."
3,"Great Series, but buy another version instead.","For only $64.99 (as of mid-March 2010) you can buy the more complete (35 disks, with Law and Order cross-over episodes and film) version:Homicide: Life on the Street - The Complete Series (repackaged)"
3,Market gouging,"I agree with others that this was a great TV series, but, it's been gone a long time, and charging $350 for 7 seasons in todays market is just gouging, I've seen it all and loved it but would never buy at this price. $30 per season after 5 years of being off the air (and, it's been 7) is all I will ever pay. Good show, bad price."
5,excellent,i would recommend this book to anyone who has to manage people in any capacity...from managing your children to managing your employees...Coach Bowden has proven himself to be a true leader both on and off the football field.
5,Very Great Guitar for Heavy Music,"Bought this guitar a couple months ago and it was the best $600 I've spent...Its very comfortable and not too heavy at all, the neck plays fast and the action is nice and low so there's not much needed effort to fret the strings. The EMG pickups are amazing, and when played a loud volumes, sounds extremely heavy and crunchy.The Floyd Rose special system is amazing, I did all types of dive bombs whammy tricks and it never went the slightest out of tune.This guitar is perfect for metal/hardcore music or anything heavy. I would highly recommend buying this, it's well worth the money.PROS:Great pickupsGreat Floyd Rose systemFast neckLow actionVery comfortableStays in tuneLooks greatCONS:Whammy bar feels a little far off the body (a little difficult to strum and hold whammy bar at the same time with pick hand)Cutaway a little shallow (a little difficult to reach 24th fret on 1st 3 string, very difficult for last 3)"
3,Not equal to the sum of its parts.,"I bought this album several years ago expecting it to live up to its title. How could it not? I listened to it a few times, disappointed, and put it away for several years.I recently was discussing Joe Lovano with a co-worker, and remembered this record, telling him that I didn't think it was that good. Tonight, I pulled it out and gave it another listen, hoping that maybe I had misunderstood it the first time. I am still unimpressed. Especially when holding it up to Lovano's work with John Scofield, or Hall's work with Desmond. The playing is subdued and uninspired. There is a lot of empty space on this record--to much for my taste. I think that a more modern player like Bill Frissell or Mick Goodrick would have been better in this context. Having said that, Hall's use of electronic effects doesn't really do anything for his playing. It isn't a bad record, but it just doesn't quite come together."
1,Very Disaapointed.,"This product does not live with either its name or quality. I have used many different types of Glycerin soaps and was hoping this one to be better or comparable with smooth gliding clear looking and better lather forming. This is no better than a cheap regular soap and does not help making feel skin softer. Ended up trashing it. I wasting money on this product. The supplier service was fine product arrived on time. But due to its poor quality, I will never buy it again."
5,Clearly Natural Glycerine Soap--Easy on Skin,"This soap is wonderful for dry skin; unlike commercial soaps which are largely devoid of glycerine today, Clearly Natural is pure glycerine with your choice of ""flavorings""--Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Jojoba oil, Aloe, etc.--do a search to find your favorite.My husband loves the Vitamin E version for his shaving mug--foams well, cleans great, no soapy residue.I find this soap cleans thoroughly without drying my skin; great for removing makeup. A+."
2,"""Strange Smells Are Happening,"" or ""People are Strange, When You Use Jasmine""","NOTE: After checking this out again at the store, the soap reviewed below is actually the BLUEBERRY soap by ""Clearly Natural.""I wouldn't normally review a bar of soap--after all--what's there to review, but this bar is an exception. Perhaps the doors of perception will differ for others, but the jasmine soap has a peculiar odor.While usually a fan of Clearly Natural products, something went wrong here. I think, frankly, that it smells like poop. Seriously. And that's not exactly the ""scent"" I want when taking a shower. Another person in the family likens it to bathroom cleanser. To each his or her own, but I recommend another soap ""flavor."""
1,BROKEN!!!,"Ok, so I bought this game used for 20 bucks and the game seems to be working fine until I notice that my DS screen kept flashing and making a weird noise when I put it in sleep mode(never had this problem with other games). So I returned it and got a refund without any troubles, but boy did it tick me off. The gameplay was good graphics were goood all in all great game! IF IT'S NOT BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!! Never buying a used game from amazon again! I've had troubles with other games too."
3,IS THIS REALLY A RACE?? WHY DOES IT MOVE TOO SLOW?,"The cars move 2 miles an hour...and they call this a ""racing"" game. This game is only for kids, way too easy. I felt like going to sleep because the cars move like turtles. No excitement here. I gave three stars because there are a few things that are not bad. The environment designs are great. And the concept is good. The weapons are nice. The speed is the REAL problem with this game. This would be a great game for kids or for 80 to 90 year old seniors."
4,Great game for children,"My kids (5 &9) loved it. My husband, not that much although he likes to play all my kid's games. He said the Pokemon series or the Starwars series are more entertaining for him. The big plus is that I only had to buy one so both my kids can play at the same time, which is not the case with the others mentioned above."
5,So much fun for everyone in the family,This is probably the best family game on wii out there. It is also a great entertainment for visiting friends/family. Different levels for easy and expert. Can be a competitive game or a team work game. If you are deciding on a game to buy then this one is a definite. And we own just about every game possible for the Wii as I have children aged 4-20.
5,The best Mario Kart up to date,"If you are a DS owner, this game is a must-have.You will not be disappointed."
5,Mario Kart DS,"Mario Kart, comes fully loaded with classic characters, a bunch of new tracks, and a wireless multiplayer mode that's to die for. With a veritable buffet of racers, courses, modes, and multiplayer options, Mario Kart DS is a must play for any Nintendo fan and a requisite for any DS owner."
4,Fun Game,I got this for my 7 year old son and he loves it. I would say it is his second favorite game to play on his DS. It isn't a complicated game which makes it a good starter game for kids who are just starting out playing a DS. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was because he beat the game faster than I thought he would. With that said he still enjoys playing it and always has a blast when playing multiplayer with his friend who also owns it.
4,One of the best in the series.,"I find this game (among MKDD) to be the best in the series. Mario Kart is always about multiplayer mode. Once you finish the Championship mode you never go back and keep playing multiplayer. Fast paced as the Gamecube version (snaking included!), great tracks and good control are the key point. LAN and Internet gameplay make this game the best in the multi-player aspect."
5,Mario Kart...,Very fun. the gameplay is superb. i love this game. the racing and items you get is very good. its like racing battle tanks! you will always find someone on wifi. its a great game. if you dont have it then your missing out.
4,Surprisingly zoomy for a handheld game,"I don't have much Nintendo experience so I am not familiar with this game from it's other console incarnations. What I can tell you is that it is fairly easy to learn the basics and pretty engrossing once you get to the higher difficulty levels. I am not very good at the trick to generate quick bursts of speed while drifting so it's quite challenging. The broad assortment of characters and unlockable vehicles is nice, and there are many different kinds of track."
5,You won't be disappointed!,"The only other Mariokart I've played is the one for the 64, but I got hooked on that fast--and this one's even better! You start with only four available races in three different difficulty levels, but each time you win you unlock new racetracks, characters, and karts, which keeps you hooked, wanting to see what comes next. If you love mario OR racing, you'll love this game. The only downside is its replay value--once you've unlocked all the characters and carts, it gets a little boring since you have nothing to do but try to beat your top scores. But even then it's still fun to pick up here and there when you have ten minutes to kill.It's great fun to play against other people who have the game too. I've only tried this feature a couple times but it's great!"
5,Best game for little boys,My boys (6 and 8) love the different environments and characters this game offers. I think their favorite part is the playback option. They can watch the race that they just finished. It is not too easy for the older one. He is able to win new levels for them both to enjoy.
5,Mario Kart is AWESOME...,Bought this game for my oldest son. He likes the fact that you can link players together and basically share the game. I am 32 years old I and I even like taking his DS and playing a round myself every now and again...
5,awesome game,"I love Mario Kart it is so fun.I had this on Nintendo 64 but I don't think my N64 works anymore, that is why I brought the DS. On this game you can do a grand prix,Time trail, vs, battle and missions. I like doing Grand Prix the best. You can also do missions where they give you certain tasks they are easy at first but get harder as the levels go up. This a great game for anybody you likes racing games."
5,The whole family is having a blast!,"My 12 yr. old states that it's the best game we have had for the DS. Fun enough to flush her out of her room for a while to play with us! We have all had a great time and have had to make ourselves put them down to get other things done. Because it allows up to 8 players to link together, the six of us have no problem gaming together with this game. We all love it."
3,I DO NOT OWN YET!,"Okay. So, at first when I heard about this game when the DS came out and Nintendo announced this, I didn't think it was going be very interesting. I mean, I liked Mario Kart games, but on a handheld it didn't sound to interesting. The pictures that were released when this was announced weren't very appeling to look at. A year later, this game is shaping up to be quite a worthy addition to the Mario Kart series. When it was announced, I only cared about graphics in games. I can see the error of my ways now. That being said, I didn't care much about it. I just learned a few months ago, that this is some of the best graphics ever for a DS. This has so far been reveared as the best DS game so far. I have been wanting this sever since online play has been announced. I should have a review for this game shortly after Christmas."
1,You'll regret it if you buy it.,"I hate to say this, but it is terrible. Like the Wii version, it takes all your hard work and skooshes it."
1,Not Good.,"Watch the description of your purchases from this provider. The product I bought said ""New"", but when I received it the box as all scratched up and was not shrink wrapped. When I asked the provider about this, I was told that the game cartridge itself was new. My boys played this game and the screen keeps freezing up on it...Not something that would happen on a ""New"" game from the store. Just be careful what you buy. I learned that it's better to spend a few extra bucks and get it from a store where I can see what I'm buying!!!"
1,Fun until you win...,"At first, this is a really fun game but my big problem with it is it's WAY TOO EASY. Even on the hard settings, I had no problem. After you unlock everything, it gets very boring and I don't play it now. It would be really good if it had a really hard level or more tracks to race on. It was fun while it lasted but it's just not challenging enough."
4,DAUGHTER LIKES IT OKAY,"MY DAUGHTER HAS ALSO BROUGHT THIS ONE TO CREDITS AS WELL. ALTHOUGH SHE LIKES MARIO GAMES, THEY STILL DON'T COMPARE TO HER POKEMON."
4,This game is the best!,"I got this game for Christmas, and it is really fun! I love the way you can play classic tracks and unlock other characters. There are over 30 tracks, which is also cool, and there are all new tracks to do. However, it may be really aggravating just trying to unlock characters or karts. I think racing is really aggravating, but the game is really fun and awesome. There is also a new Mission Mode, and there are two battle modes, Balloon Battle and Shine Runners. A neat thing about the Balloon Battle is the fact that you can blow into the microphone to inflate your balloons. The easiest characters to unlock are Daisy and Dry Bones. Another cool thing is the fact that you can create your own emblem to use on your kart. This game is better than any other Mario Kart, so get it if you have the chance!"
4,Nifty game,"I bought this for my kids. They love playing it, especially since they all have DSes, so they can race each other. Recommended."
4,^nub,"It is the greatest game for DS of all the ones I have played (22). You get to explode cars and you get to blow up people in the combat match and vs match. And it is one of the best racing games. Not only do you get to race, but you can blow up people:D. But you get blown up also:( I advise you to get it, it's much bettter than that *@%#! King Kong."
4,nice game,"It is a fun game,but the shipping was bad. It took a long time,but eventually it came. It is fun to play."
3,just regular,"A lot of change since n64...not in a good way...impossible to overlap like on here,computer unrealisticly makes a comeback,too much cheating to like, Double Dash rules though!!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!,i received this game very defective!!! it didn't even work! it was horrible!! i do not recommend using this person! i was told on the summary that it was in very good condition and it wasn't it didn't even work on a fully charged DS!! it was a very horrible experience!
5,oh yea wi fi,i didnt get this game yet but my cousin brought it to my grandmas house to play it i did wi fi oh my gosh it rules you can verse anyone in the world i versed people from japan and china they stink and i told my cousin why the heck do they stink at this game arent they the one who made this game he cracked up if you guys dont like this game you must be on drugs it is true that psp is better but i still think this is fub
4,MarioKart DS,This game has many fun features and has the capacity for hours of fun just playing alone or with a friend who has the game.
5,Good Game,Haven't had the DS very long - but the kids love it. Saw 4 students (incl my son) at a local basketball game that had never met. They were synched on the DS and playing this game! Pretty cool!
5,Mario Kart DS,"Excelent, my kids love it!!!! They like to spend hours playing this game. I have to make them stop itto o to sleep. Hehehehe!!!"
5,Mario cart,"My grandson loves it , he plays it everyday and is getting quite good at it. He is seven years old and it is just enough of a challenge for him."
5,Just pure fun,"One of the best games for the DS, great graphics, amazing controls and it will keep you playing for months. If you have friends with DS, playing against each other is the most fun. Only bad thing is that the online game servers are empty most of the time."
5,Mario,"Love this game. Played it with my granddaughter at Christmas, and had so much fun with it. You really need two wheels. Would recommed it."
5,Definitely a must have,Greatest game ever made. Exceptionally good on the DS. I especially like the old school courses the most.
5,Fantastic!,"A must-have game for any DS owner, and a reason to buy a DS if you don't have one already."
5,this game rox!!!,"i love this game because its a totally new mario game! and the wi-fi is easy to use on it! get it!\----------------------------------------------------------------oh and to the person that said ds sucks, that is just your opinion not others and plus a ds rocks and it got a better score online than a psp!!!!!!"
5,My Nephew's favorite game!,I purchased this game as a Christmas present for my nephew and he loved it. He told it's his favorite game and he loves to race! My sister says she almost has to pry the DS out of his hands to get him eat dinner.I'm not that big of a gamer and I really enjoyed playing it myself. I though the graphics and sounds were unbelievable.
4,Mario Kart.,"Un juego definitivamente entretenido, agradable y con una adecuado grado de dificultad. Es posible terminarlo lo cual lo hace aceptable para todas las edades pues no genera frustración en el desempeño. Es uno de los mejores juegos que he practicado en la consola y lo recomiendo definitivamente a quien quiera aunque su experiencia sea poca. Se divertirán mucho y aún luego de haberlo cerrado, da gusto jugarlo de nuevo. Muy recomendado."
5,Mario WHO?----Had no clue this was so much fun~~~~~,Sure I've heard of Mario but didn't know a thing about the game. That was until I played it on wii at a friends house and found out if was a blast.I had to search out and wait for a sale or used one and it paid off I found one. What fun it is. Not quite the same as wii of course but still very much fun and I am much better at staying on the track on this one but still not winning very many races.Practice makes perfect. I was also recommended this by another adult DS player who read my Listmania and responded I needed this and one more game to round out my adult collection. She was right. Now I just have to sell a game as I have a rule one comes in one goes out. Guess I had better hurry and solve Professor Layton and the curious villiage. Who knew that one would be so hard. Yikes I've logged 10 hours not all at once and seem to be getting no where. Oh well different story.Get Mario Kart it is tons of fun.
5,mario kart DS,gotta have game. Mario is a classic and this game with several racing options is just fun. my kids like it and adults too.
4,Mario Kart DS,This was a present given to a grandson. It was well received and he plays with it with glee
3,Beat it in two days- way too easy!,"I have the same problem with this as with almost every game I've played so far for the DS (Kirby Canvas Curse, New Super Mario Bros). They are supposed to be fantastic, but when I get them, they are fun, sure, but they are way too short and too easy to beat. Now, I am no longer a child, but I didn't think these games were all geared for children only. There should be an age level warning, and basically Super Mario kart would be enjoyable for 17 and under. There are only 32 tracks, all fun and engaging as far as they go,but none are very challenging. It may sound like a lot but very soon after you crack open the package, you will be done and that is no bang for your 40 bucks. I hope Mega Man zx and Phantom Hourglass are better, or I am selling my DS right away."
5,I HAVE A NEED-FOR-SPEED MARIO OBSESSION WITH THIS GAME!!!,"THIS GAME IS SOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL!!!!! i only beat 50cc but I'm decent at 100cc and 150cc. this is a cool game. take it from me, this is the game for you. you can make your racer name and design your emblem with the touch of the stylus!!!! MY FAV MARIO KART GAME!!!!! GET IT!!! GET IT!!!bye."
1,counterfeit game,"I ordered this game on May for my son. My son can play the game within one month. After one month, the game did not work any more.I called Nintendo game company and asked for repair. I mailed it and received the game back after two weeks. Also I received a letter from Nintendo. It said the game can NOT be fixed since this game is COUNTERFEIT.The reason I write this review is to remind the buyers not buy any game from this seller any more."
4,Review of Previous Mario Kart Games,"I played this game today and I was satisfied. I liked that it had previous courses from Mario Kart 64, Super Mario Kart (SNES), etc. I thought it was neat. But, I really saw no comparison to Mario Kart (3DS) which I cannot wait to buy and play."
5,Mario Kart DS,My grandsons are play with it. So I'm sure they are loving. It was one of there xmas gifts. They have a DS.
4,fun game just,i got this game for my wife for Christmas she loves Mario kart and this game was no exception. This has become her favorite game and plays it all the time.
5,Mario Kart DS: Family-Friendly and Fun,"This is a great game for the DS! It is very fun,(to the point my mom wants to play with me!), and can be played by all ages.Pros.Many characters, I think there are fifteen.LOTS of carts, three per character. The regular, the alternative, and the special.You can play with others who have Mario Kart, or those who don't through DS Download Play. But those without the game have to be Shy Guy.Four modes; 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and 150cc Mirror (Where they reverse the courses.)Cons.NONE. Nada. Zip. Zilch.I would recommend this to anyone."
5,Mario is racing back,"Well were to start, of course the online is the best! You get 8 classic characters plus unlockable characters and tracks. The graphics are the best 3-d graphics yet. You get to pick some of the racing tracks for the super nintendo,n64,GBA,Nintendo gamecube and new levels from nintendo ds!!! Online is the biggest thing of course. My only complain is the online should have 8 people racing instead of 4, and there should be a chat room. Awesome game!!!!!!!!!!"

5,A CLASSIC YOU WILL LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this for my birthday from my loving parents,and I love it!Cool levels,strange items,and awsome unlockables(such as a turtle skeleton character you can play as.)You will defently love it to,no matter what age you are,or who you are.YOU MUST BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!=)"
4,Good,"This game I haven't really played, but every time I play it over Nintendo Wi Fi I always come in 2nd place. It is fun with a mix of mission games and just plain racing, not like the GC version where there are no mission games. It is just mini games. I would say the GC version is better, but I still thought that this game was fun."
3,boring and fun,this game is very fun at first. after a while it gets boring I had the game for about a mouth no and it is only ok.I never talk about the game so that means I dont realy likeit. my mom dosnt even know I own it.
5,AWESOME!!!,I played this game breifly and my kids love it!!! My nine year old mastered it in under 2 weeks!
5,Awesome game to play with friends/family.,My brothers and I love to play this against each other. So we bought two so we can both have all of the features when we play. It's tons of fun.
5,Best handheld game ever,"This is probably the best hand held game of all time. When you can link it to another DS, it's even more enjoyable as a two player experience. This is Mario Kart at its finest, and MK is already a fine series!"
4,Fun -- but could be better,"I got this because of the great reviews and because I have enjoyed playing this game in the past. The game is a lot of fun. However, once you have played all the races (even the unlocked ones), it can get kinda boring after a while. I wish there more more races/characters to unlock for more variety. I finished the game in less than a week. Now I hardly play it anymore and am thinking of selling it since it's not as much fun anymore."
4,Good game,"Graphics are nice, control of car is great. Characters look excellent. Plenty of different road courses, I will be spending many hours over the next couple of months trying to master each course."
5,Mario Kart for DS,My son wanted this game for Christmas. It was exactly what he wanted ad he plays it all the time.
5,MY VEIW OF THE GAME,I just got this game yesterday and i was very excited. I have been playing it 24/7. This game has amazing graphix. It is great if you like racing. Overall I give this a 9 out of 10. If I were you i would definatly buy this game.
5,Mario kart is back and it is stell the best game ever. and the DS game is the best.,Mario kart is back and it is stell the best game ever. and this DS game is the best. i love this game it is just so much fun you cant put it down. love the DS and love this game. a must have.
5,Great game,My mom bought this game for me and my sister. We are nine years old and we love this game very much. It is fun to play together. We both have the DS lite and the game can play up to 4 people together. It is so much fun and easy to understand how to play. Mom said it is not bad price to buy from Amazon.com than buy from GameStop.
4,KIDS LOVE IT!,"I bought this for my grandkids, age 7,9,11,13,& 14 and it gets a good review from all of them. There is lot of noise and laughter when they play so I think that makes it very good. I personally have never clicked a wii button, but love to see happy kids! (The overall 4 stars is only because sometimes they tend to argue a bit.)"
5,A must have for the DS.,"This is a great kart-based racing game that Nintendo knows inside and out. There is a good amount of customization and the characters are colorful & animated. This is a game for all audiences as well. There are tons of tracks that you can play over and over to get the best grade/amount of stars, and multi player and wifi connection makes this game great with your friends/family, and even with people around the world! I bought this game about 4 years ago and it is still one of the games I play most on my DS. In all, don't hesitate to buy this game. It truly a ""must-have"" for the DS and will be a fun playing experience for you and everyone else you decide to race against!"
5,This was a NPR driveway moment book!,"I have bought this book over and over again! Every new grandchild or other baby gets this book, once read who could live without it! A must!!!"
4,Cute story,"My sons (5 and 4) love ""scary"" stories so they really enjoyed this one. It is not really scary but the idea of a ghost was enough to keep them interested!"
5,This is one of my all-time faves!,Our whole family adores this book! We found it at the library and just had to buy it right away!On of the classics which should be a part of any young family's library!
5,A family favorite,"We have read our well-loved copy of this book so often, I think it's time to get a new edition! Incidentally, it also makes for a great Halloweeny read."
4,Just desserts,"Poor, dead Cora Lee; nobody misses her homely self, just her scrumptious cakes. So she haunts her bakery, scaring off new owners until the plucky Annie Washington shows up. But Cora Lee won't budge until Annie whips up something that ""nobody ever made for me.""After a cake-making marathon to move heaven and earth, resourceful, stubborn Annie has a head-slapping epiphany and bakes the lonely ghost a birthday cake.Priceman's ink-and-watercolor illustrations swirl and swoop with Cora Lee's ethereal presence, and a few dabs of brown or gold coalesce into mouth-watering morsels. She's portrayed Annie as African-American and Cora Lee as white, but the undercurrent of tension between the two seems more generational than racial, with Annie's offerings running the gamut of trendy ethnic cuisines and Cora Lee being a stickler for tradition.Their friendship is ordained from the time they meet, however, because who can stay mad with all that chocolate around?"
3,Slippery handle,"I've been shaving with this razor for months now.When the handle is wet, it's a bit difficult to hang onto. And it *will* get wet in the process of shaving. I wish the handle were knurled or grooved. The problem is not insurmountable, but it is bad enough that I've considered applying a rubber coating to the handle.Other than that, it is a quality peice of shaving gear which I enjoy using. I'm sure it would last a lifetime."
3,Decent.,"This is a good razor of great quality. But I wouldn't recommend it as your first safety razor. It's a little cumbersome and slippery. I like the heft and its adjustability. The drawback is the top piece is a too round at the top to get under your nose to get a good shave on the upper lip. I generally use a different razor for this portion, but I will come back to this one if I want a really close shave."
5,Best Razor Ever,This is the second Razor of this kink we have bought . Love them. We are buying them now for our grown children.
5,"Contrary to popular belief, it's not that hard to adjust when wet","Length:: 1:08 MinsMy technique for adjusting this razor when wet. As with most sharp objects, the safety of this technique is dependent on user competence. I've used this technique for weeks without so much as a scratch; depending on hand/finger size and other factors your mileage may vary. Bottom line: I am not responsible if you cut yourself. No offense, but this is the internet so I have put this in here for the .5% minority that would try to make my life miserable if they got a cut from this (I've encountered such before). For the rest of you, hope you enjoy the video."
4,Excellent razor,"I bought this to get away from the absurd prices charged for the current razor designs.Combined with Feather blades, I use one blade a week, changing on Sundays.You can cut yourself, if not careful, but the shave is excellent, using standard GilletteFoam gel, so far.Hard to get under your nose.I wish they would make a single blade injector razor. Had to buy one off ebay.The double edge stays sharp, and is much faster then the single edge, and easier to clean.The single edge gets under my nose the best.I find this double edge to be fast and well designed. It would be a bit better if youdidn't have to spin the head completely off to change blades.It seems a bit expensive for a safety razor, but that's my value perspective. I don't doubt itwill out last me."
5,Best razor ever,"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. This is the iPhone or Macbook air of razors and shaving products. Unbeatable quality that will last a lifetime, you'll probably pass this down to your kids."
1,I had high hopes,"I really wanted this to work for me, but after numerous attempts, I'm giving up and going back to my little Mach 3 system. 1) The thing is just too big to get the details done under the nose, 2) I noticed no improvement in ""closeness"" and 3) I got nicks by the thousands, every time. I tried every adjustment to the handle I could think of, every wrist angle, and every facial yoga posture imaginable, but I'm sorry - I had no success at all."
1,MerKur Razor,"I ordered this razor as a Christmas gift for my son. When it arrived, I just wrapped the box. He opened it on Christmas Eve and the razor was broken. Something about pins on the razor head that keep the blade in. I've returned the razor and he has requested that I reorder another one."
4,Tough and Heavy,Much heavier than I thought it would be. The adjust-ability is really nice as it has taken me some time to get used to shaving with this Safety Razor. Would definitely recommend for a novice.
5,Fantastic,"This is an absolutely fantastic razor. I've had no problems with it and it shaves great. It's expensive, but over time you will save money. I am actually looking forward to shaving now."
4,An in-depth look at the Soldiers serving in the west.,"This book really enlightens the reader with interesting personal narratives. The book also dispells the myth of a ""John Wayne, She wore a Yellow Ribbon"" frontier Army. It picks up from the end of the Civil War and leads you straight into the Spanish American War. A wonderful book for those interested in in the daily lives of the soldiers form typical daily lives to military justice. This book also helped with my summer Interpretation job at Fort Mackinac. Michigan were we portray 1880's U.S. Army."
5,Targus Power Inverter,"Received the product in a very timely manner, in good condition, and it does what we wanted. Sits in cup holder just fine and doesn't put so much strain on the power socket in the car."
5,Well Done,"I like how this book has been put together. There are Doreen's (I assume) drafted and typewritten poems (often with cross-outs and notations) and there are photos of some of Doreen's witchcraft tools, as another reviewer stated. Some of these poems I have seen in other places, but some I have not. From other books I have read about Doreen Valiente, I surmise that Doreen is the true founder of Wicca, as much of the liturgy is attributed to her. Gerald Gardner would have been lost without her, and Wicca never would have gained the popularity in our time, especially among women. I am not Wiccan, but I appreciate Doreen's contribution to providing an ethical view of Witchcraft. She made it easier for many to come out of the broom closet."
4,one of judy's best,I found this movie very entertaining. Judy sings and dances up a storm. The songs are okay. But once again the best thing about this film is judy. The finale was one of the best scenes in the film. Judy pulls it off with little effortThis is one of my favorite judy garland films.
5,A Dilly of a Movie...,My Favorite Judy Garland Movie. She is Beautiful and what a voice. My best friends and I get together for his birthday every year and watch this movie while eating his version of Lilys star cake. A must see for all Garland fans.
2,"MGM, agiain, says that Judy is a","Plain Jane. She isn't. She becomes a beautiful woman. 1943 was the year for her. She shines. Unfortunately, this film does not let her shine very much. The score is forgettable and Marta Eggerth has waaaaaaaayyyyy too much screen time. But she's here (Marta) and we just have to shut up and like it. I'll shut up.Van Heflin, like all the men in Judy's MGM movies, can't see that she's a beautiful woman. Is he blind? Garland is so lovely that it should make Hedy Lamarr faint. But Lamarr (who isn't in the film) doesn't faint and Garland the trouper soldiers on. Brave girl.It's not a great film, by any stretch. Even the musical numbers are rather unmemorable; nothing remarkable. But Garland succeeds nicely in the role of a show-biz wannabe.The brother with the door knob fetish is odd. And the hat. The hat! First Garland wears it. Then a black woman. Then a monkey. Horrendous.Perhaps the least inspiring Garland musical out there."
3,Strictly for Garland Fans,"Judy is great as only she can be. She takes a mediocre story and rises above it. The story here is shallow. It starts off pretty good, then about two thirds into the movie the plot bogs down and drags a little. It picks up again toward the end. What could have been a great musical is lackluster because there are no memorable tunes here. Garland does superior work as always given what she has. Van Heflin is not right for the male lead...he seems miscast. Fay Bainter and Spring Byington are excellent in their supporting roles. Richard Carlson also deserves praise.If this movie had better musical numbers it would have been superior. This is not one of Garland's most memorable pictures but if you are a Garland fan, you will not be disappointed because Judy makes ANYTHING shine! I'm sorry I can only give this one 3 stars but there are better Garland films out there."
1,A True Stinker,"MGM made this bomb AFTER the fantastic ""For Me and My Gal""???? I mean, it's not as if they didn't know how to use Garland, and use her right! They really wasted her in this dud. And why on earth did MGM give so many more musical numbers to that ludicrous broad with the operatic voice, whose name I can't recall? Or does it just seem that way because her voice is so annoying?Anyway, there is one bright spot in this stinkbomb, and that's the last number. So just fast forward to the part where Lily becomes a big star (surprise, surprise, hope I didn't ruin it for you!) and listen to Garland sing and dance her way (finally) through a bizarre, but still enjoyable ""Broadway Rhythm.""P.S. If you can stomach those annoying brats that play her siblings, you deserve a medal. And what IS the deal with that wierdo who has a thing for door-knobs???"
2,Introductory Material. Little Technical Details,This book gives brief introduction to many important aspects of RF and uW engineering. There are very little mathematical derivations and technical explainations. I'd suggest buying Microwave Engineering by the same author (David Pozar) which is an excellent book on the subject
5,This game rocks especially with the cheat codes!!,"I have been a fan of Godzilla for years and I began to beg my mom to by it for me the moment the add came on. When I finally got the game a month later, I put the game on and I was dissapointed when I found out that I only started with Godzilla 90`s, Megalon, and Anguirus. But I got more monsters as the yeat went by. I finally only had to unlock Rodan, Mechagodzilla, and Orga. I soon found out the cheat codes and I played this game at least 2 hours a day. If you are a fan of Godzilla, this is definatly a game for you!!"
4,Best Godzilla Game to date,"This is one of the best Godzilla games to date. I highly recommend the Xbox version or GCN version if your a fan of Godzilla.Excellent graphics(all though the GCN could be better)and it's a blast to play as any of the monsters my favorite being Kiryu aka MechaGodzilla 3. I bought a GCN for this game but no sooner than I had done so I found out that it was going to be ported to xbox.One of the good things about the Xbox version is it supports custom soundtracks, it's really great to play this game while your favorite Godzilla scores are playing in the back ground.Excellent game a must have if your a fan of fighting games or monster movies."
1,Midi-schmidi,"MIDI QUICK START is a 2nd grade level text; worthless, overproduced, incredibly overpriced. I wouldn't give it away, much less attempt to sell it. It's two redeeming qualities: it'll only waste ten minutes of your time--if you bother to read it cover to cover--and it doesn't take up much room in the trash can."
4,"Got the job done, but smelly.","These are as described, rubber leg tips. They replaced the missing tips on our ladder just fine. However they have kind of a stinky burnt rubber smell that my girlfriend couldn't stand, so we threw out the extras."
2,Not worth it!,When I received this mask already a feathers had fallen off. A couple days has passed and already the rim around the mask is falling off. Very poorly made!
1,"A great Blu-ray of the great Satriani, BUT ...","I just received this Blu-ray from Amazon here in Brasil.I am praying for years for ""Satriani in San Francisco"" comes out in Blu-ray. Will we have it someday?For while, there is this BD, another GREAT show of Satriani and his band.There is one BIG problem, the aspect ratio informed by Amazon is 1.77:1 for the Blu-ray and for the DVD is 1.33:1 (4 x 3).The blu-ray ray of Satriani that I received looks like just a little larger than the traditional 1.33:1.I have anothe Blu-rays of shows with 1.78:1 aspect ratio and they look like a ""REAL RETANGLE"" (16 x 9).Why the Satriani Blu-ray is more for a ""4 x 3"" ???Obs: I use an excellent Infocus IN81 and project in 120"".Someone can EXPLAIN ME ???"
3,Same songs over and over and over,"How can Joe put out SOOOOOOOOO many live albums and yet ALWAYS have so many of the same songs on them? Right now I'm listening to the title track to Not of this Earth - a stunning song -- and one I will never hear played live -- why, I guess because we need to hear Summer Song and Ice 9 for the 100th time.. Always with you always with me, ..again??????Joe if you are going to release ANOTHER live album next year (which you will) please in addition to the new songs (which are great to hear live) include songs you've never played live or haven't played for 15 years for disc release purposes - relearn them if you must.Your to do list is here --the Phone Call, the Snake, Not of this Earth, Motorcycle Driver, Time Machine, and Thinking of You. We don't need the 10th live version of Flying in a Blue Dream as great as the song is. Just being real here.. can't believe none of the other reviews have a similar problem."
3,Another great chance wasted!,"One star for the final quality of the Blu-Ray DVD. Excellent production. Another one for the performances of all the members in the band. And, finally, another star for the ""never released"" songs from Joe's new album. But, unfortunately, I have to agree with some of the reviewers; we don't need another live version of ""Always with Me, Always with You"" as well as some other songs too! Joe has a vast repertoire and his new band is amazing, so I don't understand why he has to repeat some songs, which have been included in all of his live DVD's. For fans and JS's guitar playing style followers."
4,Great performance but video a bit shaky.,"If you love Satch, then you're gonna love this. It's the first high def production for him. My only beef is that the base is so strong in the venue that it shakes the cameras so much that it makes it very noticeable. I can tell it's the base because the vibrations follow the beat of the music. It's more of an annoyance than anything else but I've never seen this on any other concert video."
4,Excellent Satch live!,Great live material by Satriani. 3D looks pretty fine. The only dislike: the sound. Title menu music sounds lots louder than the actual concert music.
5,Freud quality,"I bought this bit to route the bull nose to complete my raised fireplace area in the corner of our living room. The material I used was white Oak that was recycled from a building built around the turn of century. It's beautiful wood with much tighter grain than you see these days and it's hard. Very hard. Like all Freud router bits I've owned though, this made short work of it and left very little sanding for me. Truth is, if I wasn't so picky, I could have left it alone, but I sanded it to rough it up a little because it was too smooth and shiny. Sure, there are cheaper bits out there that will cut the same profile, but, they won't do it as well or for as long as a Freud."
2,Really disappointing.,"We purchased one of these units for our medical office, and it broke down within 2 weeks. We exchanged it for another unit of the same model and this unit also broke down after 2 and a half weeks. The unit at first worked great, and it is fast and the copies look good. That is what kept me from giving the product a 1 star rating.Possibly there is a design flaw. Possibly all the units at the store we used were dropped off a truck.Even though this unit more closely does what we were looking for, we went with a multifunction HP to preserve our sanity."
1,Pathetic,"The copier has worked intermittently, but the paper drawer won't stay closed so the machine shuts down.I've had the unit for 2 wks and it still won't print. Xerox has not provided me with a phone number so all communication has been by email and takes 2-3 days before I hear from them.My son the computer analyst has been unable to get the unit running. Unfortunately, it seems to be a pathetic machine with little or no technical backup.I'm anxious to send it back."
3,Great While It Lasted But I Won't Do It Again,"How can a company grow its business when there's no follow through on service once you've purchased, and outrageous costs for parts? On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate my XD at a 10. I've had it at least 3 years, never had a problem. Then I experienced an ""accordian"" paper jam. Need a New Fuser Assembly. The one dealer near me said he no longer sells parts, only new copiers. Cost of part - almost as much as the copier. Time to wait for part - 10 days. Technician cost to install - almost as much as the toner, per hour. Result - I'm buying a brand new Canon."
4,Great device,"Great copier and printer. Fast, great quality and ergonomics. Caveats: Required installation of updated XL series drivers to print from some programs. Some difficulty in using with peer to peer network. When everything was finally configured correctly, I became very satisfied. Xerox phone support was great. NB: Prices vary widely for this discontinued SOHO product, so look for close outs."
4,Very Good Little Copier,I really like the xd-100. It gives great copies and a pretty good speed. My only dislike is the price of the toner cartridge. I have been refilling the cartridges and have good results. Refills cost about $100.
1,Xerox Is A Lemon,"Finally ran out of ""starter"" toner cartridge. Replaced with brand new one. After only about 1600 pages (just text with one or two small graphics, 72-150 dpi), the J1 came on and refuses to go out despite numerous recycles of toner cartridge shaking.Tried calling Xerox. Not in at 4:15 pm Reno time. Tried to email Xerox. Website won't take email.Xerox has lost my business because of their lack of responsiveness, and their over-priced poorly designed product. As soon as I can afford to get a new printer, I'm getting an HP. I KNOW where their offices are. In the meantime, I have to go to Kinkos, and that makes me even madder at Xerox.What thieves!!"
1,self explanatory,"YO HE DID HIS THING MAN! HE REALLY EXPLAINED HOW SHHHHHHHHHHH**TTY THIS ALBUM IS. MAN GET UR DEEP CAVE MAN VOICE ON FREEWAY 1-20 AND GO BACK TO THE WOODS WHERE U CAME FROM!!!!! FIRST SHAWNNA NOW U DAMN WATS NEXT PEE WEE HERMAN GONNA SIGN A TWO ALBUM DEAL WITH ROCA FELLA? MAN QUIT DISTURBIN THE PEACE LITERALLY AND TELL LUDACRIS TO FIND BETTER TALENT, CUZ BY THE SOUND OF UR VOICE IT SOUNDS LIKE HE FOUND YOU INA DEEP AZZ CAVE AND U THE LAST OF THE AMAZON CAVEMAN TRIBE!! SO DO LIKE I DID AND GO GET LIL WAYNE ( THE CARTER) THATS LIL WAYNE (THE CARTER) AND TELL THEM UR BOY YOUNG E. SENT YOU !!!!! I KEEP IT REAL U GOTTA FEEL ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Oh My F***** GOODNESS!!!,"LMAO, what is this, this is the worst album i have ever heard, along with any mobb sleep albums. dont buy this, you cant understand what this guy is sayin and if u do its garbage anyway, the only song im feelin is the single (Break Bread). It just has a catchy hook that i like sayin.LMAO. this is........man this is garbage LMAO, i burnt this cd, and ended up selling it for a quarter. thats how much its worth. AND DONT FORGET THAT 2PAC CD PEACE!!!!!!!"
4,It's an ok album...,"I admit I really can't stand his voice, but the album is ok. It's better than what I thought it'd be. So go check it out."
4,Whoa!,I didn kno tha I-20 could go tha hard. He impressed me wit this alblum the hardest song on the album is so Decatur he jus ripped it through tha whole track. U got to go pic this album up.It's a must have
1,Break What? oh......bread with butter?,"whhy is this guy around, now ludacris is aiight i haven't got a problem with him, but i-20 is really bad and wack, why is this guy selling records? if this guy can do it.....anyone can""Self Explanatory"" was no good, 1 out of 5 it deserves and i would not recommend this unless u are a chingy fan, nelly fan or luda"
3,Save Your Money,"I think you should save your money and buy a better CD rather than this one. Not many tracks are good to ride to. But, there are a few good tracks on this album. Here are my favorite tracks:-Eyes Open Intro (Good beat, pretty tight song)-Break Bread (Tight song, which inspired me to buy the CD. A decision that I later regetted)-Hennessey & Hydro (TIGHT song-Featuring Three 6 Mafia. The best song on the CD)-Point 'Em Out (Pretty Good song. Beat iz clean)-Slow F***in' (Pretty good freaky song)You should save your money and buy another CD. Even though it has some good tracks on it, you can probrably download them off KaZaA or something. My advice-Skip it."
3,Disappointing,"I was a little disappointed with this release. It seemed to lack a certain something. However, I really like his cover of Rahsaan Patterson's It's Alright Now. This is the only Marion Meadows CD I own. Perhaps I should get a couple more to really be fair to him because I know there has to be something better than this out there."
1,...eh..ok,It wasn't that appealing when I first recieved it...I thought it was going to be a real silver stering and not one made of plastic....
1,This product is unsatisfactory,"I bought this printer to replace an HP Laserjet 4. We print a lot of pictures of houses as we are real estate brokers & appraisers. The printer would not print the pictures in the 1200 x 1200 mode. The tech blamed it on the software. The printer also does not have paper recognition for the two available trays, so when you print out something in say MS word, you have to go tell it what tray to use everytime. We didn't have to do that with the HP Laserjet 4, the right tray was choosen automatically. This printer has a long way to go. We sent it back"
3,Not as Pictured,"The picture is a DB-15 F-F.The product description is a DB-15 M-M.The product shipped is a DB-15 M-M.I suppose it functions well enough.But for now, I'll throw it in my electronic junk drawer."
1,"has nothing to do with ""Catherine""","This film is just erotic, like watching a sports illustrated swimsuit video, no story just erotic poses. Not exactly what I thought it was."
5,A wonderful resource!,"The words from The Economist say it all -- how did we ever live without this book? It is an invaluable resource for introducing oneself to major movements, ideas, and people in modern thought. Having studied Postmodern British Literature as an undergrad, I can say the description of Derrida's Deconstruction movement is a better summarization than anything I have read -- and I think this is true for the book as a whole. It is inclusive without being cluttered, and incredibly informative yet readable."
4,Enjoyable. Lots of laughs.,"I just finished this book and I enjoyed it. I usually look for women authors but I'm pleased with my choice of this book/author. He made me laugh, maybe even taught me something (through the character's dad and also Sister North). Sweet, touching."
3,Not Much Here,"Aside from some really great dialog, and a few interesting characters, ""Sister North"" reads like an extended episode of Northern Exposure. Kokoris' story is completely driven by actions and dialog, but the real story here should have been about why Sam is the way he is, making his personal redemption more satisfying for the reader. As it is, I really didn't care too much about him, and was more interested in what became of some of the secondary characters."
4,Abbott & Costello in their heyday,"This is one of Bud and Lou's funnier movies. It features the pack that grip routine, teller in the bank, you couldn't whip cream with an outboard motor, and the phony piano playing routine,as well as some nice songs from Ginnie Simms and the Johnny Long Band. The chase scene at the end was silly, but other than that, this is a lot of fun for any fan of Bud and Lou."
3,A historical perspective of the study of management,"I had a hard time finishing this book, tried it at least three times. It wasn't the knowledge that the authors' admission of falsifying data in support of their findings. After reading some of the online commentaries and authors' interviews, I accepted the advice given in the book are still valid. In my last attempt I managed to finish 80% of the book and skimmed the rest. It could just be the age of the book. I mean, concepts such as ""close to customer"", ""empower employee"", ""simple management layers""... and you get the sense that ""OK, what's new here ?"" These are all very good advice. Ask 100 CEOs and 101 would response with the same platitude. I guess I just don't believe these are the deciding factors to become Excellence. It is still a good read as a historical study of the science of management."
5,Inspiring and informative,"Tom Peters is a gift to this generation. He has taken subjects that have been blown out of proportion and brought them to manageable levels. By doing this, he has created an environment where the common business person can provide and take advantage of exceptional products and services.The concepts he develops are easily tracked to texts developed across the years. The illustrations and examples of these are straight from every day life and are a part of what everyone has seen. After placing normal activities into the text book complexity and removing the shackles of academia, he is able to ask, ""why doesn't everyone do this?"" There are no answers to that question, only actions to be performed."
1,unscientific & misleading,"The notion that successful companies uniquely exhibit certain characteristics should have been demonstrated by comparing these companies with unsuccessful companies - by only having a successful population, no conclusions are valid."
1,In S. of Excellence is right...and Peters should start by...,"searching himself, cause he will be amazed at the lack of excellence. The data he quotes IS FAKED. As in, made up, pulled out of thin air, guessed, etc. And it took him YEARS to admit it. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
1,Audio CD is Worthless,"The audio CD is just a generic CD from a company called ""ListenUSA!"". It comes in a super slim generic jewel case with no documentation of any kind. It must be abridged or just a summary of some kind because the run time is only 52 minutes. I'm not even going to bother listening to it. Amazon has refunded my money so +1 for Amazon."
1,Do Not Buy the Audio CD,"If you are looking for a worthwhile quantity of information presented in the book, do not buy the Audio CD version. It is low quality, apparently copied from a cassette version, and contains so little useful information is was a waste of my time and money. As an example, at the end of the CD is asks you to turn the tape over, but of course there is no back side of the CD. The information is truncated and choppy."
5,Timeless Classic,"Like many groundbreaking works, this one must be seen as important when it was written for what it said then, and important now for what it has led to. Inspired, without doubt, by the monumental Drucker study of IBM, it took case analysis a step further. Its seminal ideas are found in many contemporary studies and schools or management thinking which have taken these principles yet further.That doesn't mean it should no longer be read. But, after reading it, and to get the most from reading it, other contemporary works should be included in your reading list. For example, Jim Collins' ""Built to Last"" and ""Good to Great"", and John Roberts' ""The Modern Firm"" take Peters and Watermans' original insights many steps further. ""In Search of Excellence"" however, is unlikely to lose its status as a classic, and the broad strokes of its conclusions will continue to be recognized as timeless principles."
1,Fake,"Author admitted to faking data. Most of the so called excellent companies ended up either poor or average performers over the following years. Read ""The Halo Effect"" instead."
5,"This book is a major reference book, not just a 'good read'","This book is not just a 'good read' it is the sort of book that you take notes and pass on the information to others in business. I had a hard copy but must have been lent and never returned. Having it on Kindle makes the access to it permanent and reliable. We cherish this book. We were first introduced to this book by word of mouth, that is how excellent it is."
5,A classic on Management and Mindset,I respect Mr. Peters tremendously. This book is a classic. Excellent from an Entrepreneur standpoint. Mindset is everything. Take advantage of this book. Hands down one of my favorites and 5 stars. Must have.
5,Brilliant Book That Add's Luster To Every Reader's Thinking,"Brilliance begins and often ends in the most fundamental concepts. In search of excellence makes the point well in the business context, where the authors discovered from intense study that the best companies are the best in executing the most basic business tasks. And, the most important product brilliant companies make is not something physical rolling off an assembly line. Rather, it is their thinking. This book, and other more recent works such as Why Didn't I Think of That? - Think the Unthinkable, give us the critical thinking tools we need to execute business basics better than our competitors, and on occasion, to come up with truly innovative ideas that transform business altogether. In Search of Excellence shows us how to find answers when others do not, leaving others asking the critical question ""Why Didn't I Think of That?"""
2,"Some good info, but not worth a buy","Although the book has some interesting points it is not as easy to read as let's say ""Good to Great"" by Jim Collins.Moreover, as others have pointed out some(all?) of the information in the book is NOT based on real data. This casts a shaddow of doubt over the entire book.In short, the book may be worth a glance if you can get the book real cheap, but in my humble opinion north worth buying."
3,"Good from historical perspective, faulty in hind-sight","This book was the 1982 best-selling look at what were then excellent companies and an attempt to distill the eight attributes they had in common. It still ranks high as an important historical contribution, but two-thirds of the ""excellent"" companies disappeared, got acquired and disassembled, or went through extreme difficulties. Hindsight tells us the eight attributes were simply things those companies did well at the time, but were not the answer to longevity. In fact, at least five of the eight attributes appear to be detrimental now. However, this book is still a good read for those wishing to track the evolution of management thinking from at least early Drucker to the present."
2,"You're Better of Reading ""In Search of Stupidity""","While some of the advice in ""Excellence"" is good standard business practice info, I recently read a very funny new book called ""In Search of Stupidity: Over 20 Years of High-Tech Marketing Disasters.""It made some excellent points that people should know. For instance, the data in Excellence is faked; ""Stupidity"" reprints the Busines Week article in which Peter's admits this. Once I read that, I had a hard time taking Excellence seriously.In Search of Stupidity also points out that practically *all* of the high tech companies Excellence profiles either failed or had major financial problems. In my opinion, the book is a much better look at the real world problems that face companies than Excellence."
4,Cool game. Great music!,"You are commanding a shuttle mission to divert an asteroid before it hits the earth--and this is years before Armageddon/Deep Impact! Once you stop the asteroid, you discover an ancient ship--and you've just hit the ignition. I found this to be a very pretty game, with some excellent voice-acting and fantastic orchestral music. Some of the puzzles were hard, but I felt a real sense of accomplishment when I finally solved them, and brought ancient technologies back to life--just call me Scotty!"
4,For Some Fun,"I'm not much of a game player, but after playing Myst, Riven, and Titanic, I wanted more. While The Dig cannot live up to the beautiful graphics of Myst and Riven, it is fun to play. At times the graphics were rather horrible, making it difficult to find a critical clue towards the end. Other than that, the puzzles were fun although not very challenging and the story was rather entertaining, although a bit corny. The game takes place on an alien planet...you've crash landed with your friends, forcing you to solve puzzles and make the right choices in order to get out of there. You have to look very closely at the details, because the clues can be easy to miss. A variety of different puzzle types and a few scenes are visually stunning, yet not on the scale of Myst or Riven. In short, if you just want something fun and relaxing, you'll like The Dig."
1,Who's kidding who?,"This is a perfectly dreadful game. The characters are awful. I got to the point where I couldn't stand any of them. There are long sequences where you have no real choice but to listen to them make idle, idiotic conversation. The game play was agonizingly slow and buggy. I played it out but was deeply disappointed by the whole thing. Yuck!"
4,Who's Boston Lowe?,"Really fun game - with bizarre plot twists and solvable puzzles... Even more fun when you realize who does the voice for Boston Lowe. Think x-Files, Robocop, Terminator 2. The voices added to the game."
1,The Worst,"I bought this book out of morbid curiosity. It's so out-dated, it will enrage any modern day feminist. It's rather offensive to males as well."
3,Great Dizzy,"This CD is exactly what you would expect from the Ultimate series. A great recording and a bunch of good tracks. However, I only gave it 3 stars because I am not as fond of his later Be-bop work. It is definately a good addition."
4,his best yet,"graham coxon's solo work has come a long way from ""the sky is too high."" this album exmplifies just what graham is capable of, and how promising his future work will be. definitely worth more than one listen, and at least one song on this album will strike a chord that will capture your heart"
4,brilliant,"This cd is simply brilliant, and I do not through that word around freely. I think Albarn and company was foolish not to compromise with Graham, because listening to this, and listening to ""Think Tank"" it is easy to see that Blur lost a major component.All Blur fans who felt let down by ""Think Tank"" check this out, you will not be disappointed. Graham has never sounded so relaxed and confident in his playing. Again, brilliant."
1,Did not live up to expectations,"I bought this program to track employee time off. The program is very limited in how you can set up the vacation, sick time and personal time off. You have to use either an anniversary date set up or a year end set up for all the time off. My company uses anniversary date for vacations and year end for sick & personal time off. There is no provision for added vacation for longtime employees either with this program. In the set up all employees receive the same amount of vacation... there is no way to set it up to accrue more vacation after 3 years of employment. This program was a waste of money for me. I ordered it primarily to help me track employee time off and accrual and it does neither."
4,People Manager Review,"while utilzing this product for HR purposes, it is easy to use and cuts back on all paperwork"
4,Talented cast makes bio romantic & entertaining.,"I thought this might only interest science enthusiasts or real film buffs, but the acting and chemistry between Greer Garson (Mrs. Miniver) and Walter Pidgeon (Forbidden Planet) really make science romantic. There are other stars in the supporting cast, and they all do a great job bringing this slice of science history to life, including Robert Walker (Strangers on a Train), Van Johnson (30 Seconds Over Tokyo), Henry Travers (It's A Wonderful Life), C.Aubrey Smith (Beyond Tomorrow, Five Came Back), and Margaret O'Brien (Meet Me In St. Louis). My favorite movies of this type are Edison The Man with Spencer Tracy, and Young Tom Edison with Mickey Rooney; but the sheer quantity of raw talent makes Madame Curie just as good as those favorites."
2,ok,not the type of movie I like. just fast forwarded through. i wouldn't recommend it but it depends on your taste.
1,Cant believe I paid $13 for this.,I could have easily compiled this information with a few hours of research on the internet. This book is not worth the $13. Maybe $3. I read it in 10 minutes and now it just sits there. I feel stupid. The book has half a page (or a few sentences) of information and 1 or 2 dumb facts at the bottom. Lots of empty white space. So I paid for space?
5,its awesome and cheap,its so awesome and cheap me and my friend are doing a show im a mermaid shes a wizard so this is awesome!!
5,Worth Buying for Poetry Written In Gasoline,"Probably one of Refuseds best songs, the 7 minute epic Poetry Written In Gasoline is on this EP. Any Refused fan knows the title track, one of the best hardcore songs ever. Blind Date and the remix of Refused are (...) great songs too making for a great buy, especially for any Refused fan."
2,not impressed,"Package was in poor condition. Listed as new, looked old or used.I returned to product. And still had to pay shipping cost."
4,Amazing!,"What a fun little amp! It sounds great and puts out a lot of volume for the size.It makes you want to be like Carlos Santana in Mexico City, and take a walk around town playing guitar..."
4,Race to uncover secrets buried by disaster,"""The ruined House Cannith citadel of Whitehearth holds the key to constructing a terrible magic weapon. Agents of the Emerald Claw will stop at nothing to recover the ancient device. As malevolent forces hunt for the artifact, resourceful heroes battle the perils of the Mournland to reach Whitehearth first and discover the secrets that lie within.""This adventure for four 2nd-level characters is designed to follow the events of the Forgotten Forge adventure found in the Eberron campaign setting, but it can easily be run as a standalone adventure.All in all, Shadows of the Last War is a well written adventure that pits the party against one of the most nefarious organizations found in Eberron."
5,Great Zouk CD!,"This was my first Volt Face CD and I can say I was NOT disappointed! If you are a fan of zouk music you will definitely like this upbeat CD. It stands apart from the other zouk music by trying out different styles of music with zouk but not letting go or losing the zouk music which is fun and relaxing at the same time. In other word, it is a BOLD, PUMPING CD that you can either dance to or sit back and listen in your living room or while driving your car.(Beware some of the songs can make you speed). From track 1-12 it has a little bit of everything. In my opinion, Georges Decimus (ex-Kassav), Katryn Thelamon(WOW what a voice) Jeff Joseph and all the other musicians did such a terrific job with this CD that I am trying to find all of their previous CDs. Wish me luck!"
4,Monder YOuntain Bing Strand,"This cd is a good addition to all of yonder's other releases, however, this mountain tracks has the weakest song choice. If your just beginning to listen to yonder i would start with a mountain tracks 1 or 2. The best part about this cd is the complimentary dvd, its definatly worth the purchase just for the dvd. There is some great footage from their tour in Europe, and its very well put together. Buy this for the dvd, buy other mountain tracks or either studio albums for the music. These guys are unbelievable."
3,"Good, but sad",This is my eleven year old daughter's impression of this book: It was really sad because many people died. It was a good book but it was really sad. I did enjoy reading it.
5,COOOOOOOOOOOL!,I Think this is a great book. Our class read it and they think this is a great book too.Its about a pilgram girl who journeys to a new world.You should read it yourself!
4,This was good but could have been better.,"I liked Hattie, Clotee, and Zipporah best. This one was okay but could have been better. But I think most people who want to learn about coming to America on the Mayflower then building a village before winter will enjoy reading this. Other than those other girls H, C, and Z, I think you will enjoy THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO and THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JONES, A FUGITIVE SLAVE. You'll like his sister Beulah. That book isn't just for boys!"
5,A sad and historical book! Definetly Dear America!,"This is book is the diary of Remember Patience Whipple, a young girl on the MayFlower and its first voyage to the new world. It descibes the hardships of the first winter in America. She discovers that it will be a hard, sad, and strange winter. Read this book if you like Dear America."
5,Excellent short story,"This book is excellent for young readers to get a taste ofAmerica's early history. The author used words which are easilyunderstood by a young reader. This helps especially when it comes to books about the Pilgrims and such. Response to the readers (Lubbock, Tx; Leicester, England; and Cebu City, Philippines) this book was written for children with words children can understand and it doesn't hide the fact that it's fictional. Lastly, this book is not boring to us Americans and our young children. The people who are looking for Remember Patience Whipple's name on the Mayflower passenger list must be the one's who sighted Elvis at Burger King last year."
4,it was a fun read,"I liked this story very much. Though I admit it can be somewhat slow, for the most part i kept wanting more. Even if the book was fictional and there was no Remember Patience Whipple on the mayflower that doesn't make it a bad book whatsoever. I love history and know a lot about the mayflower and know that this book is fake and I still could enjoy it. I would definitly recomened it to anyone. I think it could help a lot of people realize that the journey wasn't all fun and it was hard and a lot of people died. I LOVED IT."
4,"Great Book, few errors","This was a GREAT book. I have read it many times, and wouldn't mind reading it again. There were a few errors. It is FICTION, OK, it's NOT real. It mentions someone (I won't say who) going back, but I read that no one went back to England. And the part about the diary being found in 1850 and all was like, ""OK, this is Fiction, you can stop trying to convince us it's real now, because we should know it's not."" But all in all, it was a very good book that I like to read."
4,Very good!,"The story was very interesting and realistic but I don't think it was very well researched because the author didn't say mutch about hte horrible winter that they faced or the first thanksgiving. But besides that, it was a lovely story!"
5,Best Book I ever Read,"This is my absoulate favorite book. It really tells a lot about what it was like back then,and since I love history this was a great book. I have read this book since i was 9 years old,i am 12 now at it still is my favorite book. I deffinitly recomend it."
2,Boring as can be,All I wanted to do was finish this book.I had borowed it from the library and I had read the titanic one and that one was good so I thought this was going to be good.I admitt that it dose have a lot of important information in it about the mayflower but other wise this book is just dumb.I feel bad for the people who when't threw this but still the book is preety boring and evreytime I read it I got a headake I only rated 2 stars for the information ans that it wosen't all boring.Don't read this book or if you start to and it gets boring don't read on anymore.
2,Boring Compared to Most in Series!,"i guess this was okay, but i found it disapointing compared to the Zipporah Feldman diary. while that was fast-paced and good, I found this diary boring and slow. I saw a lack of plot in this book. if you like the series, you should read it and make up your own mind, but if you haven't read the Zipporah Feldman diary, i would read that one first."
2,A boring journey,"Reviewers -Flora, Roxanne, Steven, Garrison, Marlon, and Allison A Journey to the New World: The Diary of Remember Patience Whipple Girls: 3 stars Boys: 0 starsA group and I read a diary written by Remember Patience Whipple, a young pilgrim girl who sailed to Plymouth on a ship called the Mayflower in 1620. It was well written, but we think that if it were not a true story then it would have been more appealing to us. But it was a very informative story (or at least from what we know). Even though we were not completely satisfied with it, it was a great book for history, and a lot more fun to read than textbooks!! If you do decide to read this book we can guarantee that you will be on the next ship to America!"
1,Historical Balderdash!,"My grandchild & I read this book last spring as part of our homeschool studies of early European immigration to North America. Liv loved it - until we researched the REAL girls that came on the Mayflower. Remember was on the boat - but she was 6, not 12! Her ""best friend"" according to this book also came over on the Mayflower - as a babe in arms!There is a wealth of information available about many of the people that came over on the Mayflower, including the girls that really were 12, 13 and 14. We wrote our own historically accurate ""Mayflower Diary"" of a real 12 year old Pilgrim girl.NOTE also: Liv did not notice that the language used and topics of conversation in much of this book were extremely inaccurate for the period, but I did. All in all, a huge disappointment. The only book that we have found to be worse is the ""Magic Treehouse"" version."
2,"Cute watch, but breaks easily","I gave this watch to my 6 year old niece for her birthday on February 18th, 2006. One of the wings broke off that same day while she was changing clothes. Being unable to be fixed, her mother broke off the other wing to match. My niece likes the watch, but without the wings she doesn't wear it very often at all."
2,HP Laserjet 2100TN,"The autoselect feature does not work and it's a major problem for a network printer with 3 paper input trays. Push the wrong button in your word processor and it will reprogram the driver to work in manual mode only with no instructions in how to undo this. The 2100 is a great home printer, the 2100TN is a lousy office printer."
3,Don't expect the HP of yore,"I bought this product to replace an old workhorse printer, the HPII, and was quite disappointed. Print quality is not so stellar--inadequate adjustments for print density via Windows software; buttons on the machine's front are confusing and counterintuitive, and worse, the machine is surprisingly noisy--motor gear-up and -down from printing a page is a veritable clatter. Speed (8 ppm) seems inadequate for a machine in this price range, when other, less expensive laserjets can now do 10 or 12. And papertray, though large enough, has flimsy guides. All in all, I miss my old HP!"
2,Feeding trouble,"This printer has trouble feeding itself. Pages often need to be pushed in, which becomes a chore. Not reccomended."
2,Thought-provoking,"An interesting book, which examines a 1992 Canadian court case concerning Aboriginal ceremonies from a variety of perspectives: colonialism, nationalism, feminist theory, etc. Although the questions and ideas raised are interesting, reading the book is a bit frustrating. I found myself wishing for more factual information, more details about the case itself, more information about what had happened, but instead practically buried in analysis. I also think that the author's political motivation was much more concerned with the fate of Quebec than of the native peoples, which struck me as somewhat disingenuous. Additionally, I think the author owes more to Foucault than he credits. However, I found it worth reading, if simply to force myself to question some of my assumptions about law, sovereignity, and individual rights."
1,abstract - obtuse - pseudo-intellectual,Denis attempts to put an Aboriginal law case into perspective but fails miserably. His abstract pseudo-intellectual style fools no one and his points and arguements have little sway.
4,Poorly made book binding,"The recipes that I have tried have been great so far as I am in the process of trying them. Beware however, this book is poory made. I really wanted this book, but from the first time I opened it, the pages came loose. The whole book, not just a few pages. It is really bad."
3,Classic,"Debbie Reynolds sings beautifully. She holds control over the show and brings it to the front. Her classic ""ALways chasing rainbows"" is wonderful as is, ""You Made me love you""."
2,Only useful as a reference.,I used this book in an undergraduate course in compiler design and found it overall to be almost useless. This book only makes sense if you already understand compiler design. The authors frequently throw out dozens of terms that they don't bother to define for several hundred pages. With minimal effort they could explain exactly what a symbol-table is used for or at least give some idea before giving an in-depth analysis of issues in symboltable design but instead they inundate the reader in terminology (to scare off the weak-willed I think) and let the explanation appear 250 pages later.With that said the book does cover alot. It has lots of examples (that are probably the only parts that make sense) and talks about lots of important language specific issues. Going back to it the book is a useful reference. But the parts I didn't learn about still don't make any sense. That's why this book is an okay reference but a miserable learning device.
5,so important for student in computer engineering to read it.,"congratulations, to that good work , but, i need answers to exercises of the book, it will help so much in understanding the book."
2,The most overrated classic,"If you study langages and compiler design, you WILL hear about ""the dragon book"". Yet, it is the worst book I've read on the subject. Very difficult to follow, and it seem you just cant find what you want to."
3,Good but not organized,"The book is the compiler's bible. It is a must for any one interested in compilers. However, it is not organized (e.g. it repeats the concepts in different places), not very easy to read (if you read chapter 2 you will probably get a shock but if you have the patience to continue reading the remaining chapters things will improve and become clearer), needs more examples. Another negative thing about this book is that there is no solution manual for the instructor. A better option for a compiler course is Louden's Compiler Construction."
2,This book is overrated.,I don't know why this book got such good reviews - in my opinion it is simply NOT GOOD. I think it would be very helpful to people who already know some things about compilers - but if you come without background - and want to learn the material from the begining - Stay away. I haven't found a good book though...
5,The Dragon is the standard text but....,"""The Dragon"" is the standard text on compiler theory and practices, and a must to have in your library if you are into compiler writing. It covers all what could be referred as the fundamentals of compiler engineering. When I first got my copy of it, late 1986 it soon became my number one reference, although I had most of the other compiler titles as well on my bookshelves. It completely covered my needs for a reference in those days, from parsing through global optimization.But on the negative side. It can no longer be considered as a the complete reference as it used to be. Due to it's age, it is obviously missing totally on today's advanced topics, specially on native code optimization for the state of the art super-pipelined, super-scalar RISC architectures, and special issues concerning object oriented languages of today, and technologies like JIT compilation."
3,Very abstract.,"In my reading of this text, I found that a large quantity of the information drifted between ""repedative"" and ""abstract.""The text discusses tokens, identifiers and such, but fails to explain means of how it would extract such components.It almost feels as if it is a thesis on the subject rather than a practical text. Add to this the teder-todering between C, pascal and assembly for examples of code. (Which requires you to deciper the example code.)If you're not after practical application, this is probably going to be a good text for you. Otherwise, I feel it is not worth the money."
3,"An overly academic out-of-date, but classic work","This book, in its time, was a classic. When it was publishedit was one of the best books available on compiler design.Like the compiler design books of its time, this book has anacademic bent. Compared to later works, it is overly formal,using obscure notation which is not really needed.This book may have laid the foundation, but it has been replacedby better books. In particular, ""Advanced Compiler Designand Implementation"" by Steven S. Muchnick and ""OptimizingCompilers for Modern Architectures"" by Randy Allen, Ken Kennedy.The introductory compiler books by Grune et al or Appel maybe useful for those who without compiler design experience.In all cases these book concentrate on real compilerimplementation issues and do not get mired down in formalnotation."
4,ROCKS!!,"This band ROCKS!!!! One if the best punk/rock albums I've heard in a long time. A great combination of fresh lyrics and a total rockin punk sound. Check out ""Knee High"", ""Lipstick"" and ""PowerStrip"". You won't be disappointed!"
4,The Various Styles Of Stan Getz,"This CD is a great sample and collection of Stan Getz's many abilites. He is featured in many formats such as with strings, the quartet, jam sessions, and the latin/ bossa nova group. He is heard in excellent conditon on most of the tracks, and Stan and Dizzy on ""It Don't Mean A Thing If It Ain't Got That Swing"" will knock you off your feet. This is a great intoduction CD to the wonderful world of Stan Getz. Oh, and for long time fans, trust me, it won't hurt either."
3,It's not really turquoise.,"When I picture turquoise, I picture a rich green slightly bluer than emerald but just as vibrant. Lamy's turquoise ink is closer to aqua, and it's not even totally opaque -- its translucency makes it almost pastel-light. I was really disappointed by the shade, although there is nothing 'wrong' with the ink itself."
5,Aya is awesome,"Don't listen to anybody who disses Ayaya. Unlike some people who put out CD's, she actually has talent. Don't mistake youth for lack of talent. Her songs are very easy to listen to. Most are very upbeat and fun and some are soulful. Don't expect an opera singer. Expect a plucky girl who can lift spirits. I really look forward to what she's going to do in the future.LA"
4,Mind Yoga,"Everytime I go to the library, some book I wasn't looking for whispers my name and I feel compelled to check it out. This is what happened with ""Everyday Creative Writing.""The writing exercises seem simple at first, but the topics for the exercises are more complex than one might imagine. Smith and Greenberg invite you to ""pan for gold"" from everyday situations, such as ""Why I Will Not Get Out of Bed"" and ""In the Checkout Line."" Then they ask you to ""brainstorm,"" ""freewrite"" and ""free associate"" until your mind is open to new possibilities. They also include examples of some topic writings - stories, essays and poetry - that will also jiggle the juices.After a few days of working the exercises first thing in the morning with my coffee, I was thinking creatively all day. Definitely not a book to try if you want to hold onto Writer's Block. Good stretches for stiff minds."
4,Great Exercises to Stimulate & Stretch the Mind,Glad my grad student sister at CSULB introduced me to this book. She found 'Everyday Creative Writing' in a display of published faculty books. Great writing exercises and ideas for my writing group. Can't wait to try them out next week at our workshop.- Jill Murphy Long
3,Product Reads 400mg in Ad but Sent me 200mg.,"Received the Grape Seed Extract but was supposed to be 400MG but bottle says 200MG. I called company and told them about the product error not being the right MG. The bottle on there ad said 400MG in big letters so there is no mistake and the one I have says 200MG. The bottle still says 400 on there ad so I don't know how I received 200MG. I received 1 bottle of Olympian Labs Grape Seed Extract 200mg, 100 capsules bottle.We had a little discussion and in the end they refunded my money immediately which was nice.Olympian Labs Grape Seed Extract 400mg, 100 capsules bottle"
4,Good price,If you don't mind waiting weeks for shiiping i guess it's a good deal blah blah blah blah blah blah
4,NOT AS GOOD AS GNC,I think gnc is better than thati preferred gnc next timeit is NOT AS GOOD AS GNC o
5,great product just don't order it from vitaminlife,Great product. We are in central america about to head to south america and the drinking water is a problem sometimes here. Gives you stomach considerations. But a few capsules of this and you feel better.Just don't order it from VitaminLife as they will send you whatever they want whenever they get around to it - in multiple shipments - lie about items being backordered when they show it in stock - ignore your emails and then lie about what YOU did. Great stuff just get it somewhere else.
5,Great stuff. Highest value for potency and product.,These are the best I have tried. I'll do anything that might make me healthier while also possibly helping me keep my hair (tough fight I know) and these are probably the best I have tried for Grape Seed. I also did the NOW brand and they were also good but not quite the amount that these put in their capsules. Olympian are also a very nice brand with quality packaging and products all around.
5,Hard to Find '40s Hawk,"I was going to actually shell out forComplete Coleman Hawkins on Keynotebecause the few Keynote tracks I'd heard on some other compilations sounded so good. Hawkins was standing firmly at the crossroads between swing and bop during this fascinating period in the development of the tenor master. Then I found this collection, and found that 13 of the 16 tracks are all Keynote sessions featuring the likes of Cozy Cole, Teddy Wilson, Sid Catlett, Roy Eldridge, and Buck Clayton. The other three cuts are definitely among Hawk's best for Verve in the '50s: an unaccompanied solo, a gorgeous latin flavored piece with Ben Webster, and a pretty ballad. Sonny Rollins picked the tracks for this collection and thank you Sonny!Sound quality on the Keynotes varies. While less than modern remastering techniques is capable of, it's better than what I've heard on those few tracks I already have on other CDs. Amongst my dozens of Hawkins CDs, this has quickly become one of my favorites."
2,Was hoping this product would help with my occasional urinary tract infections,I get UTIs every few months and was hoping this product would be successful for me as it apparently has been for others. I gave it at least a week to work on a recent UTI and finally had to give in and get antibiotics from the doctor.
5,Much better than a Classic,"Up until recently, I have been using a Littman Classic stethoscope. Then I tried the Cardiology III, I am never going back!"
1,Broke in half on the first use,"Upon putting the Littmann Cardiology III on for the very-first-time, one of the arms broke in half. Littmann is sending me a replacement but I have to wonder about how reliable this brand really is. Buy something else."
4,"looks never used, but it was open","Although the unit looks new, it was not in its orginial shrink wrap. it was already open, and I thought it said Brand new. Very fast delivery!!!"
2,"Something Missing ""Like Quality""","When I first bought this scanner, I thought it was one of the best for the money. The scans were fairly quick till you scanned at 300 dpi and more. It was easy to install, and the software was based for an intermediate user. A few bells and whisiles. But four months after using the scanner, It started to slow down, and eventually went from one scan every 40 sec. to one scan every 15 minutes. HP was no help, they led me to correct the problem that did nothing but cause conflicts and lock-ups. Not to mention there are no drivers to be found for the 6200 series scanners. So just please be careful. I suggest you don't buy this scanner at all."
5,Good,I like this but wish it were longer. Will pull out to read again. Quotes are not all the same ones you have heard before.
2,Love it!,I can read a portion of this book daily for inspiration. It will truly give you a feeling of peace every time you open the book!
1,Eh...,"I was hoping Klein would have written about the quotes. Luckily, I only paid $1.99 for it because I could have easily gotten a list of quotes such as these online. Definitely not life-changing."
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed that the entire book was inspirational quotes. I could get that off of pinterest or facebook. Didn't read the intro close enough I guess. My fault.
4,Guotes are good and easy to remember,I did enjoy looking at these quotes. They seem to keep me in a positive mood. I would recommend it to friends who need encouragement.
3,referral,"This book was referred to me and I thought it would be a good read. It's ok, I'm not fond of it though."
3,Change your life!: a little book of big ideas,This book would make a nice gift. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone looking for some great inspiration and optimism.
3,"Godd reference book,...","This is a great reference book, but don't expect practical applications. After all it is a tiny book.Good to pick up vocab though."
5,Jam-packed book,"This 54-page French/English book is PACKED with 1001 useful French words ~ including their gender ~ and a sentence using the word in context...I agree that this book could be challenging for someone who doesn't know the French language ... there is no pronunciation key for one thing ... however, as a beginner, I think it's a nice little addition to my self-study of the beautiful language...A worthwhile investment for $2."
2,Skinny little book without much to offer,"It's a book without a good definition as I'm learning words alone do not make a language ! I'd go for texts / workbooks and other tools and work in a step by step process to learn the language. As an English-American speaker, I imagine the words in my area of the US might be very different from the words typically or more often used in another part of the country. But, for the low price - it was not a complete waste."
5,"A ""Must Have"" For Beginners","From the get-go this book is a ""must have"". This is a great companion book for anyone who needs to know a little French , or uses some French , or , is a student . I keep this book handy all the time."
3,Meh...,"Ce n'est pas le meilleur livre sur le monde, mais, il marche. Fondamentalement, c'est un dictionaire."
3,Nice Dictionary of common French words,"I give this 3 stars because, FOR THE PRICE, it is a decent book. Who can complain at the price? I DID, however, just do two reviews for ""Routledge Frequency Dictionaries"", and found them to be better overall. I gave them 4 and 5 stars, so I HAVE to give this one fewer stars. If the rank were out of ten stars, the others would have had 9 and 8, and this one would have been 6.If you are looking to have a basic, but somewhat impressive, vocabulary, and do it quickly and at a low price, this is a good book. I bought this book, but I am STILL waiting for the Routledge Frequency Dictionary for French."
5,"Most Useful and the Cheapest French Book in the World, Probably!","Simply put, I learned more French from this two dollar book than from all other French books combined!"
2,Not the most useful book.,"This is not the most useful book of most useful French words. It would be more useful if it had a larger category section. As it is, it is primarily a 49 page dictionary with a four page category section at the end. It ends with one page of tips."
1,Not very user friendly.,"The book is like a dictionary, the words are in alphabetical order but they are the French words in alphabetical order and a sample phrase is at the end of the definition. I might be able to tab the phrases I will be using the most, but the little booklet is pretty worthless to bring with me to France."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER,The fax picks up the line while you're talking on the phone randomly. I did use the fax line periodically for calls but can't anymore because of this 'feature'.AND THE WORST PART!XEROX STILL HASN'T RELEASED WINDOWS 2000 DRIVERS MONTHS AFTER IT WAS AVAILALBE!
4,Fine prog rock with classical influences,"Although not as good as Paradox, Moving Target remains one of the best albums released by Magna Carta. DC Cooper ads a new dimension to a talented band, giving the album a darker mood compared to Royal Hunt's previous albums."
5,Quality cut,"You can't go wrong with quality router bits. Smoother cuts, less sanding alone is worth the extra $. I own a couple Freud router bits, slowly replacing my starter bit set as needed with Freud bits. No smoke ='s no burn marks ='s less sanding."
1,junk,The plastic shells of these are too thin and they put too much of the gel inside. The result is that they swell when frozen to the point that they get a big goose-egg that cracks the plastic. Buy the Gott (Rubbermaid)versions instead.
4,Nicely illustrated and useful,"This book is an introduction to basic patterns and exercises in modern and jazz dance. It serves its purpose well, and the illustrations are effective in conveying to the reader the sequence of steps needed to do the exercises. The photographs also serve to inspire the beginning student of dance into what is possible in this art form. The author also gives the rthythmic timing in all the exercises, making it easier to pick music to accompany. Teachers will find it useful in lesson planning and as a reference."
4,Definitely where home card makers should start,"While this product comes in more interesting paper types--and heavier card stock--this is clearly the preferred card style for home card makers. Vastly superior to their quarter-fold counterparts, half-fold cards are what you'll usually find commercially in card shops. Though they do fold to a somewhat larger-than Hallmark (tm) size, the after-folding allignment is dead-on, and you have more room to express yourself. If approximating the look and feel of a 'real' store-bought card is important to you, therefore, go with this format. However, I'm partial to more textured card-stocks--Hewlett Packard makes an excellent 'felt' ivory--so I have to drop the rating for this one down a star for its white blandness."
3,Convenient but boring,"This product provides a certain amount of convenience but is not anything special. It is 8.5x11-in. card stock for inkjet printers, with a crease in the middle for folding. It has a template number for use with word-processing and creative-project software, but templates can often be more trouble than they are worth, especially for the simple task of dividing a simple letter-sized sheet into two parts. There is a convenience, to be sure, in having correct-sized envelopes packaged with the paper; but again, there is nothing special about this size of envelope; and they feel somewhat flimsy, not exactly something in which to encase the results of your artistic labors.Plain is OK, but to get a top rating from me this product would have needed to have been special in some way, such as perhaps being glossy on half of one side in order to provide a space in which to print a photo vibrantly."
4,Great greeting cards that feed well and print nicely,"Perfect cardstock for creating my own greeting cards on my inkjet printer. I used the templates for Microsoft Word, and they fed nicely into my Canon MP830. Totally satisfied and will use this for future cards."
5,Greeting Card Stock,"Avery/American Greetings Half Fold Blank CardsThis package included envelopes, which I didn't need."
1,Poor Quality,"I have gotten this product before, but card stock has never been this thin, I am almost ashamed to use it for cards."
1,Waste of Money,"I ordered these, initially, because I wanted to create professional looking cards. This is nothing but 8 1/2 x 11 cheap card stock with some envelopes. I tried to put a photo on one, selecting regular paper instead of photo paper, since photo paper it is not, and it still sucked up so much ink it practically drained my cartridges.It's okay for putting little clip art things on it, I guess, if you want something that looks like consumer home-made stuff, but If you're expecting that they are the size of greeting cards and will have the look of a greeting card, don't bother. For this, you can go out and buy some nicer textured card stock and matching envelopes or whatever, and you'd have a better looking product for less cost.Cheap stuff."
1,It Jammed My Computer!!!!! :-( :-(,"I've been making my own cards for years. Being disabled it's difficult to go out and buy supplies, so I often depend a great deal on Amazon.com..and they always come through, one way or another. I was totally out of card stock but realized I had the new pack, one minor problem. The card was to big for the printer by about 1/4"" ....so, late birthday card for my granddaughter...I won't buy these again!"
4,Great for everyday use,"I've been using these in my HP 1610 inkjet printer and they work great. Text and photos come out crisp and vibrant. I downloaded the template from Avery and it works perfectly in OpenOffice.The best thing about these is that they are pre-folded. This provides a much better result than using regular card stock.My only complaint, which is minor, is that I wish the paper was just a little bit thicker/heavier. Other than that, I'm very happy with the overall quality and will probably order another box when this one is used up."
1,Jammed Printer,"After printing 20 Christmas cards with Hallmark glossy card stock and then another 10 with Hallmark matte card stock, I opened the new box of Avery card stock and printed side one. I reloaded the paper to print the second side just I had done for the previous 30 cards and the printer jammed up! I pulled the jammed paper out. I attempted to print again and this time I waited awhile by setting the card aside to dry for a long time. I put in it the printer and it jammed again! This is unacceptable. If it had happened with all my attempts to print I would think it is me, but I have already printed 30 cards easily with Hallmark paper. If you are using heavy card stock, get Hallmark paper! I am using a professional printer so it's not the printer at fault."
2,Enormous hassle,"I have spent hours wrestling with this paper. I wanted cards with writing on the outside and pictures on the inside, with room to hand-write. The three cards that I was able to coax through the printer (HP C7180) are beautiful. Fifteen sheets either jammed or showed smudge marks even after repeated trouble-shooting and cleaning of all printer parts (for 2, I fed them incorrectly). The printer handles every other paper I have tried without any problem whatsoever - photo, resume, business card, etc. I simply could not get this paper to feed into my printer properly. I ordered a second box and took the files to a printshop. They said they couldn't guarantee that it would go through their machines either. I finally had them print it on their card stock. The quality of the three that I ultimately printed was much higher than the print-shop version, so for that the product gets 2 stars."
2,"Nice shoe, but NOT leather","These shoes are really nice and very comfortable. The problem is that they are listed as being leather uppers, but the shoes I received were all man made materials. If they had been leather I would have kept them."
3,Heels are TOO High,"I wear a size 9.5, I ordered both a 9 and a 9.5, The size 9 fit perfectly. However, I returned them both per the Heels are 3"" high. Shoe was not comfortable to me because of the height of Heels."
4,Good compact length,Works well. Height is just right that you need not remove it from your vehicle(if you're using a sedan). Lowest SWR I could tune it to is 1:1.5.
5,Excellent,Product is excellent but packaging should be improved. The tiny stainless set screw is not secured in one place in packaging and can easily get lost.
3,"Good, not great","I have this antenna mounted to a piece of sheet metal bolted to my truckbox. I don't run my CB that often, but when I did, I had alot of static. This antenna is perfect for a person who uses their CB when their driving on the highway, and who want to know where the smokey's are at, or somebody who needs car-to-car communication on a road trip, or somebody who enjoys ""sandbagging"" on their radio. If your going to use your CB radio everyday, get a bigger whip. I think this a good antenna for the price."
5,Believe It - It Works!,I've used this antenna both indide the house and as a car roof-mount. It greatly increases the distance of handheld CB radios (over the factory antenna) and pulls in locals and skip talkers with no problem. Be sure to shop around to find the best deal as the price on this unit can vary by as much as $15 or $20!
5,This IS a Great Antenna!!,"This is a wonderful antenna. It goes without saying, that it must be matched to the radio. Once it is, reception & transmission are very clear.The magnet mount REALLY holds. I drove 70+ mph into a 40 mph headwind, today. The antenna didn't move a mm, very strong magnet. I am impressed. I thought I would find the antenna hanging by the cable, but it was still on top of my SUV doing it's job. GREAT ANTENNA!"
4,Good Value,I have this ant. mounted on my pickup and it puts out a good signal when well grounded. In particular I transmit better to the rear of the vehicle because the signal planes off the bed of the truck. Easy to tune.
4,one of the must haves,strong magnetic hold and easy to mount anywhere on truck and car. no more fiddling around with swr meter
2,SWR issues - defective replacements- customer care = poor,"SWR on this was not really good above 2.1, I tried to find bigger whip and ended up in replacing the whole antenna because that was suggested by Barjan LLC distributor. The second shipment from Wilson had defective cracked unit and ended up in replacing that too. In this process I spend almost double the cost of antenna. Wilson Little Wil cost me $68. During my hassle I found K-40 Antenna from local CB shop, I purchased that too and amazed by its performance. SWR was flat across all 40 channels, out of the box."
4,Good Antenna,"I use this with a Cobra 29 WX/NW/ST, and SkyThumper Mic, I have the Little Wil antenna on the top center of my 2003 Explorer.Reception is great, but transmitting, you will be hearing them more than they hear you. I'm already looking to move to up to a Wilson W1000.Also, I didn't buy off Amazon, who ever is selling for $85 plus $20 shipping is a rip off.. this is a $35 antenna at my local truck stop, $40 online at other sites. don't buy it for more than $40"
1,Silly magnetic paper weight does nothing.,"I saw good reviews for this crappy antenna and found that it does absolutely nothing for me. I took it to a shop to have it tuned and it was still crap. The antenna comes with 18 feet of thin coax and it doesn't have a connector at the base of the antenna so you can easily swap out antennas. Ask the guys at Mauldroppers.com and they'll tell you the Little Wil antenna sucks. I wish I never touched this crappy antenna. I should have just sent it back. All I get is crackle, fuzzy voice and nothing else. If you want a decent antenna, go with the Wilson 1000 or the 5000. I used this on a Uniden PC68LTW. That's about all I can tell you. Stay away from this product. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."
1,SWR so bad I did not even try to adjust the antenna length.,"I ordered a CB (27 Mhz) antenna not a 26-30 Mhz adjustable antenna. I tried to adjust the antenna (cut/extend)but the SWR was so bad on ch 1 & Ch 40 I could tell based on the provided instructions what to do, cut or extend. I purchased a Radio Shack antenna instead and the steel antenna was easy to adjust. I liked the reviews on the Wilson 'Little Wil' and how the antenna looked but it should have been close to the frequency or at least adjustable without cutting steel. The instructions says ""the whip is generally longer than necessary for ch 1-40"" and ""if you have an SWR meter"". You will NEED an SWR meter (I have one)and something to cut steel in 1/4 sections until you get it right. I use to cut steel whips in the old days when they were over 100 inches in length but a loaded whip? This antenna was so bad I could hardly receive any local traffic on nearby I95 let along transmit. Maybe I got a bad antenna."
4,Great Whip for a good Price,"Can't beat this lil wil, it stays on despite me beating it through thick brush and hoghway speeds, picks up far away conversations, and was easy to tune myself. Only problem was it did not come with a set screw to hold the wire into the base, but and flat ended screw seemed to fit the threads so no big deal."
5,"Great antenna, easy setup, amazing distance","It's amazing considering the price that I can hear conversations from 100 miles away crystal clear, and 1200 miles away with some static. I paired this sweet antenna with just a Midland 40-Channel Mini CB Radio, the handheld/car adapter.. and immediately started picking up chatter all over Long Island, soon after Connecticut and then Alabama just by sitting in an open parking lot with little obstruction. Highly recommend this antenna as well as buying from amazon. It's easy to forget about the power of CB when everyone has a cellphone, but the fact is truckers are all over this nation, and they are a wealth of information/amusing conversation. You can know what's going on 5 miles or 100 miles in front of you to avoid delays, far before GPS updates, far before the news reacts.. as well as accidents or emergencies. 5 stars"
5,superb!,"$30 primedgreat sound quality after calibrationused with Midland hand held unit.this antenna's magnet is no joke, even at over 150mph, it stays firm and planted. after CB tuning, the antenna was about an inch shorter, but the quality is much better than some much more expensive antennas.I recommend it!"
2,"Good, but no iMac support","Come on! These people haven't updated the software in months! Before I bought my bondi blue iMac, I had an old 7200, and it worked fine. But with the iMac's newer CD drive, it doesn't recognize the CD! Beware good iMac customers! (I'm not saying that other Macs are bad.) Macs rule, but this software most certainly doesn't! Buy only if you have something beige!"
1,give me my money back,"Terrible. I have had the game over one year and still can't play it. I bought a so-called ""Mac"" version and keep getting told I need a special patch. I ""patch"" in and receive a message, ""no longer working"". This company Hasbro, does not know what they are doing. And unfortunately I must give it a one because there is nothing lower. Point-of-fact: The reps do not return calls...now they are out of business. Anything to sell a product and dupe the public Hasbro!"
4,An elegant bard of seven tragedies,"I thought this book was terrific. I bought in on the recommendation of a friend who compared Neylor to Toni Morrison. She also writes in the vernacular, but hers is more accessible than Morrison's. The stories are tragic and depressing, with glints of humor and hope. I felt emotionally attached to most of the characters, and Neylot does a good job of weaving the biographies in together. I will say that the stories were just that; the sheer melodrama of these women's lives made the stories more fictional than believable. With that said, I couldn't put the book down. I look forward to reading Mama Day and the Men of Brewster Place in the very near future."
3,Too Jumpy,"Good story, but jumps around too much between characters. Gives more of a character sketch on a different character in each ""chapter"". Overall, a very good book."
2,Too touchy-feely,"This book was just a little too sympathetic for me, each and every character seemed to display a ""poor-me"" attitude. I don't like the idea of women as victims, it just doesn't interest me. The language was mediocre, dialogue below that, and the tone was just depressing."
5,Will someone PLEASE give gloria naylor her props???,"I have loved this book for a very, very long time. I think it shows the same beauty as Toni Morrison's writing but is considerably more accessible to those who don't consider themselves academics or intellectuals. I don't know WHY gloria naylor doesn't get the attention she deserves. While there have been some implications that this is a ""man bashing"" book, I don't see that at all. I see an honest look at SOME women's lives and SOME women's relationships with men, SOME of whom happening to be quite triffling. This story is not of a universal experience but it does delve into the universal emotions of longing, loneliness, dissapointment and, finally, joy and self-acceptance."
3,Pretty good BUT,"On the whole I liked it, but the characters' lives were pretty depressing. I also didn't quite get how Mattie came to be such a Wise Old Elder, when her presence in Brewster Place was due to horrendous bad judgment on her part. There's also a really horrible scene involving one of the other characters at the end -- it made sense dramatically but it totally grossed me out. And I didn't think it was resolved properly, unless you consider a dream sequence a resolution. It didn't help that I liked that character a lot!"
3,The Women of Brewster Place,"I read this book as an assignment for a lierature class. It is a woman's book typically as opposed to a book a man would typically read. However I did find the book quite entertaining and an easy read. It was no Tom Clancy, Louis L'Amour or ""Destroyer"" series, but again, quite interesting and easy to read, setting quite gentle on the literary appetite."
3,Uneven.,"Two problems: Naylor tries too hard to substitute genuine feeling with an explosion of mixed metaphors that often muddle the emotion being evoked. Secondly, some of her dialogue is flat, in particular, the conversations between the young activist and her skeptical mother; they seem written for television. The best chapters, however, are miracles of characterization, especially the first and second. The dream sequence is also excellent, a cathartic and uneasy moment involving the spontaneous destruction of a wall where a terrible tragedy took place."
5,Incredible,"A heart-wrenchingly splendid book that will make you cry and make you smile at the same time. Life-affirming, devastating, a masterpiece in form and function."
3,variety,nice variety of styles represented. enjoyed it. Some of the songs were a bit too wild for my taste. One of the artists just seemed to see how high he could play..
4,Great value.,"Great value. Usual HP quality, reasonable price. Be careful to cover printer when not in use. Dust enters through vertical paper feeder and can cause problems - double paper feeds and poor print quality. Otherwise excellent!"
4,"Outstanding quality, no comparison","This printer has outstanding output for this price range. I have used Okidata and Zerox laser printers in this price range as well, and the output is no comparison. Especially when dealing with images, or grayscales. This printer responds quickly when a job is sent to it, and it's lack of a power button and automatic turn on/off is very convienient. It also uses toner very efficiently, making Total cost of ownership lower than an inkjet over time. I have not used the scanner add-on, but have heard good things about it.There are two reason it get 4 stars instead of 5: 1. The upright printer design, although it saves desk space, is strange to me. 2. There are printers in the 10-12 pages per minute range at this price, but the output does not compare.I own this printer, and I also have had an HP 6L (it's older brother) for 2 years now, and have no problems. I highly recomend all HP LaserJets, including this one."
1,so disappointed,"I was totally disappointed with this item. It was lovely, but would not lie flat. It always tipped to one side or the other because of the way it was put together. I wrote to the seller, and asked if they could fix this, and sent it back paying my own shipping, but all they did was refund some of my money, and charge me a 5 dollar restocking fee - for an item that was basically defective. Beware."
5,Dudu Fisher - A MUST for parents who want their children to love Israel!,"The truth is, I haven't seen the english version of Dudu Fisher's videos. However, I ADORE his Hebrew DVDs - so educational, so loving, so Jewish, so Israeli! If you want your children to speak Hebrew, or are want to supplement Hebrew in your home, you MUST purchase Dudu Fisher's DVDs. He teaches Jewish children to love their heritage, their land, and their brothers with beautiful and catchy music, pleasant imagery, and a friendly, loving demeanor. I couldn't recommend him more!"
3,had to return it,"I purchased this product and returned it. It really is an excellent copier, but is severely limited because the original can not be much larger than 8.5 by 11. It also can not print on legal paper. For me, this was a serious limitation. If it is not for you, it is a great buy."
2,"Sorry Gilmour, Craftsman has you beat on this one.",The flow pattern is only good for one thing....putting out a fire. It is not much good for watering trees and such. It is a hefty piece of brass if your into collecting paper-weights. Very dissapointed with Gilmor's thinkology on this one. Get Craftsman's version of 'The Ultimate Hose Nozzle' and you'll see what I mean. Much more versatile flow patterns.
2,bubble machine,"This bubble machine is not very kid friendly. It spills out all the bubble soap if a child moves it. There is a handle so it looks like it should be able to be carried. And if it is placed on the ground, the tiny bubbles it produces don't go up very high. I bought it to replace another kind that made lots of wonderful varied sizes of bubbles and didn't spill bubble soap - but it's motor never worked consistently. So I am not happy with this one!"
4,"bubbles, bubbles",This product works fine. My little one seems to have outgrown her fondness for bubble machines.
2,Not for Dogs,"This is a high quality toy. I thought it would be a good distraction for my two dogs but it was NOT. They did not even look at it as the bubbles were flying about. Don't waste money buying it for your dog. Try to find someone who already has one and try it our before you spend your money. If you have another need for it, it would be a great buy. It works wonderfully. I can see it would be cute for a children's party. You have to buy the bubbles continuously in order to use the toy so you pay for it forever. There is nothing wrong with the product you just have to find the right use for it."
5,Lots of fun,"Perfect for anyone who enjoys bubbles. Saves Mom or Dad a lot of blowing time, when you can just put the bubble solution into this and turn on the machine. My son also likes to turn it on and off. Makes a lot of bubbles. I wouldn't leave child with it unsupervised though, as it can get kind of messy if they tip it. Have had for about a year now after I saw at our library story time and had to find one for myself."
2,"Good toy, not so good switch.","I bought this toy for my toddler son. He loved it! Blows enough bubbles for him to chase acros the backyard. Then the switch broke. No big deal, I thought. I had purchased two. Well, the next one the switch broke in less than a month. Try explaining that to a two year old! The toy was fun but not long lasting. We have been through three in a year. Each one the switch stops working long before the batteries did! The fun was good while it lasted."
3,Great bubble machine/but non portable/bubbles evaporate,"This is a great bubble machine as far as the bubbles-the bubbles come out in the perfect amount and size. But I left it out for a few days, with the bubble solution inside, and it evaporated. I thought it was odd, so I did it again and it quickly went away. I suppose I was unaware that bubble solution would evaporate so quickly, and the buyer should be aware that there is no way to close the back of the machine. So, it is also not portable. You pour the solutions in the back (not shown in the picture) and this is a completely open area. So, it can easily spill if a child reaches for it. I think this is a great machine for putting on top of a counter where the kids cannot get to it, and you are just leaving it there. For the company who makes this product: I would recommend a top secure lid for the back of the machine where the bubble solution is placed. The size of the bubbles are great and it makes a lot of bubbles over a short period of time!"
1,Very disappointed.,"I bought this bubble machine for my daughter's third birthday party. The machine is loud, the bubble reservoir doesn't hold that much bubble solution so it kept running out and the bubble output is sparse. I wish I never bought it. Save your money, because this product is a waste."
5,Great bubble machine for little kids playing,"We love this bubble machine. I'm reading lots of reviews on it and see some people are disappointed. I think it depends on what you are looking for. If you want a bubble machine for a party, to run for long periods of time without having to refill, this is probably not your product. If you just want something for the backyard that your kids can play with, this is great! Our son is 14 months old and loves to play with this. It's a easy on/off button that he can push and play with as he pleases. It creates an army of bubbles and he loves that. For everyday, backyard play, this is a great purchase."
3,OK for the price,"This bubble machine is OK--not super great or awful. It does require a lot (six, I think) of AA batteries--I wish I knew that when I bought it. But the bubbles it pumps out are pretty spectacular (almost too much but it knocks the socks off of little kids!). for the price, you can't go wrong."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"Perfect all around. It was inexpensive,durable loads of entertainment for my children ages 2 and 8, and it blew a TON of bubbles! With that perk there was also the con of bubbles running low more quickly that I anticipated, but that was no big deal since this product doesn't require you to use specific bubbles like some of the others."
4,"Weighs a ton, but is definitely sturdy",I was surprised how heavy this unit was when it showed up. It's solid steel. The cushioning is nice and it has a professional feel to it. I just wish they could have made it out of lighter material
2,Too short and not enough guidance,"That was the quickest 20 minutes and I didn't feel like I had done anything. I followed the beginners workout but had a hard time following correct positioning. They moved through the workout rapidly, too rapidly, with almost no set up of the poses. Spend a little more and try something else."
3,Good but short,"Overall this a good alternative to other exercise/pilates dvds. The exercises performed are different than typical, and the ball makes them more challenging - even for fairly experienced practioners. The 20 minutes is a bit too short to feel like you accomplish much though, with slow transitions between moves and an overall slow pace."
2,Unsatisfied,"I purchased this last year. I did not like it because it was very slow paced, not energetic at all. The space it was filmed was like the corner of a room, and only the instructor and one assistant. how the cover looks is what you'll be viewing the whole time pretty much. i did the routine maybe two times at most and havent done it since. i wanted to use my ball but ive stuck to regular pilates [my fav] and recently started beginners bellydancing. if you want low impact ball exercise , more like yoga feel, then you might like it i guess."
1,20 minutes of disappontment,"I struggle to find anything positive to say about this DVD: it is way too short, it allegedly offers two levels of difficulties but having tried both I could not tell the difference (same exercises, minor changes); it keeps moving you from a standing up position to an horizontal one (laying on the mat), then it gets you to sit up, then laying down again, wasting a lot of time and not concentrating on any particular group of muscle. At the end of it I did not feel like I worked out, I did not feel like I learn any new movements nor any challenging ones. I would not recommend this DVD and neither would I buy any more from the series."
1,Very disappointed,I don't often rate things poorly; however this item should not be sold. As a fitness expert this is an insult.
1,Warning!,"These cassettes are advertised on the package as ""Original Celtic Teachings for Entering the Divine Imagination that Created Us"". I bought them to learn something about Celtic spirituality during long commutes to work. What I discovered is that there is precious little mention of anything Celtic in these tapes. Rather than the exposition I was expecting, the author rambles on, giving his wordy rendition of God knows what. This is not the material to get information on Celtic teachings."
2,Too Hokey,"Rather than use more photographic images, the film relied on artistic renditions of the Chicago World's Fair."
1,awful....just pictures of pictures,I have collected old postcards of the White City and several books. This DVD has no new information. It is offensively politically correct. Gene Wilder drones and is terrible. I can't overstate what a waste of money this is. I would give it zero stars as in do not buy.
3,Great Info but static video,"Thinking that this film would be a documentary that I could use in teaching economics and U.S. History, I bought it. Well . . . I found it very detailed in terms of explaining the various exhibits and structures, this part of the video I'd give 5 stars to. The rest however, left me hoping the video would come to an end. Gene Wilder, while a fun actor is not the best narrator, he would put a class of teenagers to sleep. The film is very static in that it only uses old photos and artist portrayals with panning in and out of them to tell this story. Then there is the cheesy belly dancer that is put in the video and is about the only thing that moves. This documentary would have been better interviewing Chicago historical society folks, some professors and maybe bringing in the present day site before the end. I was dissappointed in the way this story was presented. Great info for informations sake, but not very good in terms of being watchable."
5,Fantastic Living History!,"This film brings to life a major event in our country's history, indeed the world's history that has all but been forgotten about. It is truly sad that there isn't much information about this in the general history books, but I'm glad I read ""Devil in the White City"" to get my interest up about such a wonderful time in our past. The twentyith century really did begin on that fateful spring day in 1893!"
5,The White City,"Expos was wonderfully done and described in great detail. Anyone who read Erik Larson's ""Devil in the White City"" will appreciate the elaborate way the fair and people were described in regards to the 1893 World Colombian Expedition."
5,Great chance to step back in time,"This video is packed full of information about the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. In fact, so many statistics, comments, and images are shared that it bears numerous watchings to digest the enormity of the fair production. Gene Wilder did a very good job of description - at an almost non-stop rate in order to include as much as possible. If you remember that the ""closing of the western frontier"" had just been announced by a U.S. Census Bureau representative and that many towns and settlements west of the Mississippi didn't even have electricity at the time, the staging of this event was an incredible example of the American spirit for trying on things new and shiny. It's worth a look just for the graphic images of the park layout."
3,Radio harness,"The harness is a direct plug and play, however it does t work for most of dodge ram as advertised."
2,doesn't play nicely with Epson,"Got some on sale for use with my Epson photo printer. The colors come out grainy and entirely unacceptable. If you have an Epson, beware."
3,its ok,"this product doesnt really kill gnats and flies on contact they fly around like its water. not sure if thats how it is suppose to work , its also changes the color of the plant if you spray it directly on your plant"
2,needed something stronger?,"I was trying to rid my compost of a fruit fly type insect. If i sprayed this directly on them,they seemed to die ,but as an over-all area treatment,it just wasn't strong enough."
1,Waste of Money,"This spray did not work! I purchased it to kill the ""fruit flies"" that keep coming out of my decorative tree in my living room. Ive been using it consistently for at least 4 weeks and they are still there. Useless! Want my $ back!"
2,Waste of Money,"I thought that this spray was supposed to be bio-friendly, it turned out to be just as poisonous as black flag. The sprayer doesn't even have a ""stream"" setting for shooting at wasps. All in all, I'm very disapointed."
3,A Good Tool for Reading the Divine Comedy in Italian,"This volume (Volume III: The Paradiso) is one of three volumes that offer the Divine Comedy in Italian with Sinclair's English translation. Volumes I and II are the Inferno and the Paradiso. All three volumes are reprints of the 1936 text. It would have been more convenient if the English and Italian texts had been arranged in parallel columns, instead of having the English translation appear at the end of each canto. Contemporary readers might also have prefered John Ciardi's translation to Sinclair's. Overall, however, this version does quite nicely. The type is clear and easy to read."
5,An Original Classic Artist In Need Of Your Support,"Okay RT!I got the money and now have this massive set.Great box set!I have heard it and find it to be very nicely done and well crafted.Some say the sound lacks, but I find it to be satisfactory and above par.NO complaints here just pure bliss...thanks for the good timessincerelyA Man In Need"
2,editing would have helped,"I like Richard Thompson but this collection was for the most part painful to listen to. With the exception of a handful of songs I found this intolerable. I had given this boxed set years ago as a gift to fellow Richard Thompson enthusiasts and was longing for it myself. I finally indulged in purchasing it and was sorely disappointed after listening to it. I contacted the couple I previously gave it to, to apologize and they concurred it was a clunker. Not every piece of work performed by an artist is worthy of marketing. This strikes me as an attempt to cash in on any available recording by RT good or bad purely for financial gain. I would not buy this again nor will I be gifting it again. In fairness it is titled as the Life and Music of Richard Thompson not the best of RT."
5,Good mix from a great artist,"This box has a great selection of both beloved and lesser heard Richard Thompson cuts. Live and alternate versions completely change the character of some classic songs like ""Don't Let a Thief Steal Into Your Heart"" and ""Genesis Hall,"" and other artists pay tribute in unique variations on ""God Loves a Drunk"" and ""The Angels Took My Racehorse Away."" My only issue with the set is the second 'greatest hits' disc, which seems somewhat uninteresting compared to the rest of the box. All in all, a worthy tribute and a fine purchase."
4,"Enjoyable, but Plot is Definitely Iffy","The basic plot centers around the daughter (Jane Powell) going to Rio for a job and her mother, Ann Southern (who looks and behaves more like her sister), trying to thwart a ""masher"" whom she thinks is after her daughter. Carmen Miranda provies some wonderful scenes in her second of only two MGM movies. Watch for the umbrella number! It's simple over-the-top lavishness and downright craziness is what made her the highest-paid female star of the 40's! Basically, the movie is enjoyable, but the plot (and the scenery--the backdrop of Rio from the hotel room is hilarious to look at) are rather contrived, even for a musical."
3,PC Tablet - NOT MAC compatible.,"All indications are that the tablet is a very good one for PCs. However, the Amazon ad stated that it was MAC compatible without further qualification. That's only partially true. As received, it is compaptible with Mac operating system 9 but not 10. Also, on the Aiptek website there is no driver to enable use with Mac OS 10. Therefore, I am returning the tablet."
3,Okay for beginners,"I bought the Hyperpen to free hand draw some illustrations for one of my books, but I quickly learned that you get what you pay for. Although the look and feel of the Hyperpen is nice, its a little choppy as you draw, almost like working with an etch-a-sketch. I don't want to turn people away from it, because its not bad for a lower end digital drawing pad, but I just didn't have much luck with it in the professional arena. I probably should've went with a top of the line product. That said it would be a cool tool for your kids to draw and have fun on the computer."
3,Helen Morgan Story,A fairly good biography for the time that it was made. After searching for her on the internet I found that the fact she died as a result of being alcoholic was glossed over.
3,Lack of special features,I really enjoyed the movie but it would have been nice if there had been some additional features such as a preview trailer or information on the making of the film or maybe an original clip of the real Helen Morgan.
2,Boring telling of a drama filled life,"The only good thing about this movie is Paul Newman. His acting stands far and above everybody else's. There is zero chemistry between Newman and Ann Blyth. She is miscast and comes across awkwardly during the whole movie. She's totally unbelievable as she tries to portray Morgan and the drama and vices Morgan went through. The script doesn't do much to really develop the backstory of Morgan or what she actually experienced during her life. This movie was/is for the generation that already knew her story. For contemporary audiences, reading a biography of Morgan is more informative and entertaining than this movie."
3,The Helen Morgan Story,"The reason I purchased this video was this is my mothers Mom. She was adopted at birth but was told later that Helen Morgan was her real mother. So I wanted to see it but they did not mention the baby she had out of wedlock in 1926 and gave up for adoption. It was an interesting movie, mainly because Paul Newman was in it. When my 84 mother watched it she was singing along with the movie. (she is a pretty good singer herself)"
4,I'm hooked!,"I've always been fasinated by the little snippets of information contained in the Bible about ordinary people, especially the women, who have done something important enough to be remembered and recorded in the most read and published book in history. What were they like? What were their lives like? What was the rest of the story behind the few sentences we have? Ann Burton has done a wonderful job of creating a very plausible history for Jael, the contemporary of Deborah and heroine of the Israeli/Canannite conflict of that time. I was able to feel her fear, her pain, and her hopelessness, as well as her joy, friendships, and dreams. It is a story of honesty, faithfulness, courage, and a touch of sweet romance. I'll be reading Ms. Burton's other books in this series."
5,"Pendragon, The Definitive Account of the Origins of Arthur",One of the best written historical references I have had the pleasure to read. Gives a historical document based evaluation of the Authurian theory.
1,Won't Run on XP,"This game was described as a game designed to run on Windows XP operating system. The game I was shipped clearly is an older version, and clearly says: 95/98/ME.It will NOT load on my XP computer at all."
4,"It's alright! It's alright! (Only the 2001 remaster, though)","This album just KILLS. It's true that the comparison to Black Sabbath isn't very well founded, but if you want to see the closest they got to the Slabbathy sound, check out the live version of ""7 Screaming Dizbusters"" on the tail end of the CD. The way they tweak the ""really heavy part"" is just unbelievable. They WERE better live. The whole album reeks of 70s, and I wasn't even born yet - just that kind of space-fixated, technically proficient, rock and roll atmosphere that is trapped in the grooves, along with traces of cocaine and mary jane. The remastering on this CD is EXCELLENT. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Probably sounds better than the original record. And YES, that is possible with the continuing advance of CD mastering technology. Oh, one more thing: the packaging on this reissue is really lavish. They even print the CD in negative Columbia colors (like the Black Side of the original record)."
5,Heaviest Cult Of Em All,"BOC leaves the murky dungeon of their debut and leaps into a harder, faster brighter sound with Tyranny and Mutation. The opening of ""The Red And The Black""(formerly ""I'm On The Lamb But I Ain't No Sheep"") is like getting hit by a metallic freight train. The sting continues throughout the first portion (I AM A vinyl oldster, so it's side one kids)with Bloom's menacing (only Gene Simmons ever outdid him)""OD'd On Life Itself"", Albert Bouchards pounding riff heavy ""Hot Rails To Hell"" and Bloom's ""Seven Screaming Diz Busters"" which is like a journey into hell itself. It took years for me to appreciate side two as much, but now I find myself actually preferring it; it's a little lighter, more psychedelic, not unlike the earlier Stalk Forrest Group material. These songs suck you into a vortex instead of beating you over the head. I guess that's why the LP's sides were labeled Red (side one) and Black (side two). I also see the 'Red' as Tyranny and 'Black' as Mutation."
2,Hello Cleveland!!,"Laugh out loud bad lyrics and vibe.Without a doubt,the most ""Spinal Tap""ish CD from BOC.However ""O.D.'ed on Life Itself"" is a classic.1st BOC album puts this to shame.I guess we were all f**ked up in 1973!"
5,Best BOC CD,Song for song easily the best BOC cd. From the hard rock hot rails to hell and red and black to dreary like wings wetted down. Quicklime girl I belivev is the best songs.. Boc classic with halloween feel..perfect playing. 7 screaming diz-busters..the most heavy metal of their songs in this era.
4,"b.o.c.,s mutation continues for a 2nd album.","b.o.c.,s tyranny and mutation was released in 1973.b.o.c wrote much of this second album on the road and in hotel rooms.this album rocks harder than the debut album,again the album cover was unusual but very cool.i think they made a concentrated effort to make a heavier album than the first one and they succeeded very well although by today,s standards this album is quite mellow, but i like it alot. for me the killer cuts are;the red and the black,o,d,d on life itself,hot rails to hell,mistress of the salmon salt,teen archer and 7 screaming diz busters although i think this song would sound better if they had recorded it around 1979 to 1981 or later.but that is my opinion.the bonus live cuts are cool too.you might just want to grab this cd.the prices here at amazon for early b.o.c. cds are great!!"
1,"Not a great tool, and not recommended","As others noted -- this is a screw down - not a clamp down as noted in the picture. It arrived dirty inside and out, rusted from being wet enough to wash it, had flaky paint, and really was not at all easy to use. Maybe its the nature of these grinders. I usually love kitchen doo-dads -- not this one. I'll never use it again."
5,Smooth cuts in difficult material,"This bit, as expected, has produced exceptionally smooth cuts for me in difficult material, including exotic hardwoods such as wenge and bubinga."
3,"For casual fans, there is a better compliation available...","This disc is not ""bad"" but I think it is of more interest to musicians, especially piano players, than it will be to the more casual jazz fan. The tunes were chosen by fellow great Herbie Hancock, and reflect his opinion of Evans' artistry. For my listening tastes, the collection ""Best of Bill Evans on Verve"" is a better buy. The tunes on that one are more fun, and hold up better on repeated listening. I love music, but have no talent for it. Those with keyboard talent may enjoy this group of selections more."
1,Not a fit for a 2005 Honda Accord EX V6,"Contrary to what Amazon's compatibility check says, this will not fit a 2005 Honda Accord EX 3.0 V6. This is a fact since I found it about 6"" shorter than the current belt."
4,The new field of gene expression,"This book is tedious, and yet it's Fascinating, and is for sure a topic to enlighten all who have genes."
4,A good easy-guide book to learn this opening,"Hello I'm a player who first used to play openings like the scotch gambit, and the itialian (Bc4), but I began to see it is difficult to get a opening advantage with that openings and the tricks only work until 1800-level. In this book you get the ideas and the most impotant variantions. The subvariations are not to much mentioned but most of the times that's because you have to be able to refuse the worse moves yourself. It's rather written for the white side, but it's more objective than most books. It's a repertoire book and there are parts of the ruy lopez like the Marshall gambit you won't find here because they advice for white to play the anti-marshall. I think that's a adventage so you won't have to see in a game yourself why some variations are worse."
2,Not near as good as the first,"i used to listen to the 1st volume of logical progression all the time, so i thought volume 2 would be a nice ""sequel"". i listened to it once and haven't touched it since."
3,Uhh?,"This isnt a LTJ Bukem album- its got one ltj bukem track on it- im very disappointed, its i havent even listened to the first disk but i skipped thru it, every track has annoying lyrics over it... UGh"
3,Comprehensive review with a flaw ...,"Certainly one of the most exhaustive treatises on the subject available today and a necessary reference for studying the history of this method of communication. But there is a major flaw ... most of the illustrations are in black and white with a key that describes which tones of gray correspond to which colors. This makes the book very difficult to use as a reference. I understand that the book was written awhile ago, likely before the advent of computer based printing, but an update is in order for this otherwise scholarly and excellent work. Hopefully one will be offered in the not too distant future. The volume is still usable, just difficult."
2,The worst toy I've ever purchased,"I purchased this toy the other day for my 3 yr. old and what a BIG mistake.The directions are of no help at all when trying to figure out what goes with what. This toy is the cheapiest made toy I've ever seen. Everything falls apart--lights, bridges,track and misc. pieces. When you push the release button the carbarely goes anywhere or falls off the track.If all their products are made this way this will be our last purchase.Don't waste your time and money on this item. :("
4,I HATE THIS TOY! BUT MY 4 Y.O. SON LOVES IT!,"MY SON RECEIVED THIS TOY FOR CHRISTMAS WHEN HE WAS ALMOST FOUR. HE LOVED IT IMMEDIATELY AND STILL DOES. HOWEVER, MY HUSBAND AND I HATE IT BECAUSE IT IS SO CHEAPLY MADE, FALLS APART BY JUST BREATHING ON IT AND REQUIRES A LOT OF PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT TO GET IT BACK TOGETHER. IF MY SON DIDN'T LOVE PLAYING WITH IT SO MUCH IT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK TO THE STORE THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS! I RATED IT 2 STARS FOR EDUDATIONAL VALUE BECAUSE I GUESS THE CHILD WOULD LEARN PATIENCE AND SPATIAL SKILLS PUTTING IT BACK TOGETHER SO OFTEN! :-) COME ON MATTEL - GET IT TOGETHER!"
1,Complete waste of money,I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this toy!!! My son loved it at first but it's constantly falling apart when he plays with it. I hate it but I've given it one star for fun because he still plays with the jumping part of the track and the police car. The rest of it is stored away in a box on his shelves. I've given it one star each for educational value and durability only because I can't give it any less than one. (I would give it a negative star for durability if I could!)
1,Very Poor Quality. Waste of money at Any price.,"Very Disappointed in this track. The police car rarely chased any cars down the ramp, which caused disappointment for my boys. The police car would hit the corner of the track and then stop while the other car went around the corner and down the hill. The track itself was very flimsy and the so called supports kept falling over. This toy sat on the shelf for a long time and when we moved, it went in the trash. The orange spinner that was supposed to shoot the cars back up the hill is worthless. I could barely give it enough power to work it up the ramp, it was almost impossible for my young sons to do it. This toy was definitely a waste of my money."
2,Keep your money!,"I agree with the rest of the reviews. This toy is very poorly made. I bought this toy for my 4 year old son who just loves race cars. I knew, because of the price, that this would not have been the most durable toy but I never expected it to be this flimsy. The tracks never stayed together, my husband and I had to constantly put it together. I guess my son got really tired of calling all the time that he just don't play with it anymore. Very disappointing!!!"
4,Buyer Beware,My son loves this due to it's simplicity. BUT it needs some reassembly quite often! It has nice wide tracks and can connect to a few other sets. I think Mattel skipped a few corners. You do get what you pay for with this one.
3,Sort of Fun but Low Quality,"My 3 1/2 year old enjoys it for short periods of time but it falls apart too much. The car shooter is almost humorously flawed. I don't understand the educational ratings this thing has gotten. Of course, a child can learn SOMETHING from just about ANYTHING but that doesn't make it ""educational"". This set may spur imagination a little (""Just imagine how much more fun this would be if it was designed and manufactured well!"") but the only thing any of us learned was not to waste money on this toy."
2,Good toy for the price,"This track does all it is supposed to do, and it does work, however it is very simple and basic. It is good for very young children but probably wouldn't be much fun for older children."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"MY 3YEAR OLD SON RECEIVED THIS AS GIFT FOR CHRISTMAS. EXCITED BECAUSE HE GOT A RACETRACK WE ATTEMPTED TO PUT TOGETHER. AFTER SOME TIME IT WAS TOGETHER, BUT WAS NOT VERY FUN. IT DID NOTHING THE BOX SAID OR SHOWED. HE SAID, ""MOMMY, PUT THIS BACK IN THE BOX AND TAKE BACK TO THE STORE, IT IS NO FUN!!"""
3,An Entertaining If Uneven Album,"I doubt I would introduce M. F. to newcomers with this album, but it's vintage jazz from the 70s that I'm delighted to hear remastered on CD. The group's take on McCartney's ""Jet"" is uninspired; the title track cooks as hot as that band ever did; and everything else fall somewhere in between. At its current low price (under $10), it's an especially happy bargain."
2,"Great music, HORRIBLE MASTERING","This is my favorite case example for an absolute in poor remastering. Maynard and his band are in top form to be sure. But there is NO ambiance and NO sonic overtones thanks to the poor remastering job done by CBS. In an attempt to mask tape hiss on this older recording, they have overdone it horribly. Sounds no longer taper off...they simply end. Cymbals sound muffled and Maynard's tone is not nearly as bright as the LP. Why CBS does not remaster his ENTIRE catalog is beyond me. I am VERY glad I kept (and burned a CD from) my LP copy!"
4,Gives Me Shivers,"I had this album back in high school when I played trumpet in stage band. My band teacher introduced me to Maynard... I think it was Birdland. The next year we played a really lame version of Gospel John in stage band. I liked the song, but hated our version and then I found out that Maynard Ferguson played it.Ohhhhhhh boy. The opening riffs sent shivers of ""I'm Not Worthyness"" down my spine. I didn't even play the rest of the song the first time. I listened to the intro about ten times before I moved on to the rest of the song.Gospel John is worth the price of admission for the whole CD.The rest of the CD is great too. It's not old school Maynard bebop,but where and why else would you get to hear Maynard kickin' out on Paul McCartney's ""Jet"" or the ultra-funky ""Livin' for the City.""After I get CD copies of a lot of the old albums I loved in high school, I get sick to my stomach. This one makes me think... I had pretty good taste for a kid."
5,Hot,"One of the hottest MF albums, with tracks ranging from jazz standards to rock to perhaps one of MF's best works ever, La Fiesta.Only a couple of his albums even come close."
5,"Great, energetic stuff!","I own only 3 recordings of Maynard, and this is far and away the bast. I never thought Chameleon could have as much variety as Maynard gives it. Gospel John is a very interesting sermon, The Way We Were is a beautiful trombone ballad that I (a trombone player) have transcribed the whole of and attempted to play. Jet may be the only downer, as nothing new is achieved. La Fiesta more than makes up for it--this must be the most energetic song I have ever heard! And although they are overshadowed by the Chick Corea hit, the last 3 songs of the album hold their own."
5,Simply one of the best works on self-determination ever!,"Behavioral researcher Helmstetter has, in this work, created one of the rare breed of books that are simple to read and difficult to ignore. In other words, it's a quick read that'll have a profound influence on your life"
5,REMARKABLE!!,This book had an extremely positive affect on my life. I have purchased several copies of it for friends and would like to purchase more! Please bring it into print again soon.
5,Choices,THIS IS A LIFE-CHANGING BOOK...It illustrates that YOU have control over the choices that YOU make in life. This book clearly expresses the power of learning to recognize the opportunity to choose and then act on it.
2,broke down within the year...,"worked great up until it started falling apart... in under a year! The calculator was not even used often. Only a few times every couple of weeks and still, the top cover was coming apart and would not stay up. Pretty soon after that, the whole thing stopped working"
4,Cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO cool!!!! Did youknow that you can put the axe into the Shadow Knight's head? Overall the toy is great.
3,A okay expansion pack,"Heroes of Might and Magic 2: The Price of Loyalty is a okay add-on with a few changes to the game. 4 new campaigns have been added with 2 long and 2 short ones depending on how long you want to play. Only 1 new building has been added which is sort of a bummer and it is only for the necromancers. A few new event places have been added and a couple of new artifacts, so if you are looking for something worth your money then go for Heroes of Might and Magic 3."
2,Leave the rap alone,"At the time this album was released, Gary Thomas had so far issued several fantastic albums, ones I would rate 4 or 5 stars. His sax playing here is only slightly less inventive, and he should be credited with trying to take his music in an even newer direction by introducing rap elements. Unfortunately, the rapping on the album is horrible, the sort of rapping that is embarassing to listen to. Rapping that makes you cringe and immediately stab the next track button.I own and routienly listen to five or six Gary Thomas albums, and heartily recommend By Any Means Necessary, Code Violations, Seventh Quadrant, and While the Gate is Open. But only diehards should buy this one."
5,Sequel equals original,"Many times sequels, especially multiple sequels, are not as good as the original. This one was at least as good as the original, and maybe better. The characters, especially Boog, are more developed, and if you have seen the first and second movies, you will really enjoy this one."
2,May I Please Have That 75 Minutes of My Life Back?,"This suffers the same fate as the Smokey and The Bandit franchise...good first movie, fair second one, and painful to watch 3rd installment. I tried, I really tried for the sake of my kids who were watching with me but there is just nothing at all satisfying about this effort. Dull from start to finish and my time was wasted."
1,Open Season 3,"This is probably the worst cartoon movie. Boog was mad at Elliot for missing ""Guys Trip"" so he ran away and joined the circus. There he fell in love with an ugly, gross, serious, and wierd bear named Ursa. Then a bear named Doug escaped from the circus and thought he was ""King of the Forest"" it was wierd. That's basicly all that happened. This is coming from a kid who LOVED Open Season 1 and Open Season 2. I wouldn't buy this."
5,Great kids movie!,"This is a great kids movie! My nephew absolutely loves it. It seem in other reviews people were upset they did not have the original voices, but for kids it is close enough. Cute story line. We have watched about 30 times now!"
3,open season 3 review,I really like the first open season 2nd is pretty good but the last one did not hold my attention. I think the characters are not the same.
1,Don't bother,"This movie is nothing like the previous Open Season movies! All the voices are different, and they are NOT funny! Not worth $1 at a yard sale!"
3,Rent don't Buy,"The third version was only mildly entertaining. Granddaughter (11) liked it, but again, this is one time rent not buy movie."
1,BAD voice acting,"We enjoyed Open Season 1 & 2, accepting that Open Season 2 was not voiced by the original actors but still quite enjoyable. Open Season 3 had no redeeming features. The story might have been enjoyable but the voice acting was so horrible we couldn't finish watching the movie. Do not buy this movie, if you must see it, wait for it to be brought to t.v."
3,Good movie for the family,"The story line was just okay, but the animation looks fantastic on Bluray. Also my kids loved the ""bunny splat"" mode on the disc. You can throw bunnies at the screen throughout the movie using our PS3 controller. The combo pack falls really short because there was no ""digital copy"" included. The studios have to understand this should be a standard for combo packs, charge $5 more, but include the digital copy! Also amazing to see actor like Matthew Taylor monitoring and responding to the fan via Amazon feedback. Power to the people!!"
3,Average funny movie,"I really liked Open Season 1 and 2 wasn't bad. 3 just isn't as good. It did have the funny moments though, and I really liked the donkey or llama or whatever, he was funny."
5,A fantastic delight for the whole family!,"Us parents had a chuckle and the kids had a hoot as we followed Boog to the Russian circus! They loved Mr. Weenie, and us grown-ups were delighted to have Crispin Hellion Glover as Fifi, the reformed toy poodle, proving Glover is still one the most far-out actors on the planet, and has certainly filled his father Danny's boots well. Can wait for more from the classic franchise! It's a must for the whole family."
5,My kids *loved this movie!,"Seriously, they can't stop watching it. I can actually leave them in front of the TV while I attend to work. I've watched it once through and *loved it."
5,Awesome Movie,this third installment of open season is pretty good. i do agree that it is not as good as the first two. The story was okay and everything. But i think they need stop right now before they ruin the whole thing. mabey it would be coll if they made it into a tv show. love this movie.
2,Time to bring back the original cast.,"Open season one was a great movie. Number 2 was pretty decent, but this one just kind of sucked. It had a few funny parts, but I am ready for Lawrence and Kutcher to return, enough of the sound alikes!"
2,DISAPPOINTING 3RD MOVIE,"We loved the first two open season movies so we ordered this one even though it got negative reviews. Well,the reviews were right. Boring, boring, boring. Oh well!!"
5,An Excellent Guide to Calculus,"As a student of one of the books contributing authors, I was able to gain a unique perspective into the material itself. The text was very informative and easy to understand. The real world applications (yams, fruit, the Quabbin Reservoir, etc.) added to the book, but by no means detracted from the overflowing content. I highly recommend this book as a guide to anyone studying calculus."
5,Honestly,"This textbook is excellent and well-written. Such examples as the ones involving the Quabbin Reservoir brought a realistic approach to the problems into the learning experience. Perhaps I am biased, since the course for which I used the book was taught by one of the authors (Andrew Pasquale), however, I feel that the book itself was invaluable. Many years later and now a college graduate (with a minor in math), I still have distinct memories of the particular problems within the book and the knowledge acquired from the course. I strongly encourage the purchase and usage of this book in a Calculus curriculum."
1,this sucks. the manga is a lot better.,"the manga of this is a lot better. they twisted lots of stuff in this, and the character voices really dont fit their age and even the characters' personalities are messed up. dont waste your money on this. buy the manga."
4,You cant miss it!,"Ok, I bought this DVD without knowing what was it was a bout, but my friend told me that there's a very good anime called Saiyuki, so that's more or less why I got it.The characters are very unique and they will practically always send you laughing, the constant fighting between Gojyo (a pervy water demon whose afraid of water) and Goku (An ever-hungry monkey god) are the main high points.Now I know people's feelings about dubs, but trust me on this one, this dub aint half bad. I started watching it in English first (No I don't like to read for EVERY frame, so sue me) and they did a very good job, one low point is that Hakkai (A VERY polite and quiet member) swears and in Japanse he doesnt, that annoyed me, but to be honest the English version made me laugh more than the Japanse version.But I say that any anime fan HAS to have a look at this series!"
4,"Great, but a cartoon book is the very best of Saiyuki!","This is not the first time I saw the Saiyuki Anime. (I watched it in Japanese version, Korean version and this English version.) Well, I think Saiyuki is quite hiliarious even in Anime version and not that bad. (The pictures of OVA and a movie version are more pretty though.) However, I prefer the comic book version to animation for some reasons. Hm..whatever...Saiyuki rocks..^0^;;"
1,Xerox C8 forget it!,"If you want to loose your money buy it. The ink head spills out and the software that it's suppose to ""control"" the printer does not work. I can't understand how Xerox sells this to their ""customers"". Last time I ever buy Xerox."
1,Dont buy,It is slow. It is very slow. Problems in printing color documents. The quality of print outs is terrible.
1,NOT WORTH IT,I PURSHASED THIS PRINTER FOR SOMETHING BETTER THAN WHAT I HAD. BIG MISTAKE. THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY TO INSTALL AND IT ISN'T.
5,Animal Magnetism,"The ""Beastmaster"" series is highly entertaining if you like such series as ""Xena"" and ""Hercules"". Dar (Daniel Goddard), the Beastmaster, is a warrior who has one adventure after another while on his quest to make things right in the world. His constant traveling companion is Tao (Jackson Raine) a man of logic and intelligence. Dar's secret weapon is his ability to communicate with all animals. Animals that offer their assistance to help Dar. Dar's strength and Tao's wisdom make for a true friendship and unbeatable combination against evil in the world."
1,Works well with MacOS 7.0,If you buy this product it's because you didn't research anything else. If you want to edit audio final cut can do a better job than sound edit. If you want MIDI than get Performer or emagic logic for between 3 bill and a 1000$.sound edit is antiquated and has very limited function.
2,An index more than a book,"Terrorism by John Pynchon Holms and Tom Burke is useful to only two groups: readers who know absolutely nothing about the subject, and those familiar with the topic who need a quick index. The former group will get a shallow but broad introduction to terrorism, the latter a reader-friendly glossary of names, terms, and dates.As an aside, this book originally was published in 1994. After September 11, 2001, in another egregious example of exploitation of the tragedy, the opening chapter was revised and dedicated to the terrorist attacks on Washington, New York and over the skies of Pennsylvania. The September 11th timeline, like the book as whole, is a comprehensive but contains nothing new."
1,Dog Sweater Making,"When I placed the order, I thought I as buying a dog sweater not a book on making sweaters. As far as patterns to make sweaters the book isn't very useful. I will be more careful in the future when I order something online."
4,Fabric,A very good book for what it is meant to be. The overall design is classy. Beautiful in many ways.
4,Great information and Tools,"I watched this VHS which was a new angle onto animal training. This was the bodywork side that I fail to see anywhere else, though there is now quality progressive animal training available.I highly recommend the DVDs, training and equipment offered by TTouch. They use progressive animal training which is gentle and effective. We bought the dog vest which was comfortable for the larger dog we gave it to."
3,Nice - but with questions,"Very beautiful watch - upon first impressions my husband loved the watch, weight, features, etc. However, and we're still currently looking into this, the second hand seems to get caught up in the same place as it goes around - leading us to believe it may be defective, as it has actually stopped there as well. We are looking into whether this is normal for this watch or a feature we're not aware of, but instincts say the second hand should be more fluid if it were really a high quality watch."
3,Got this for $75 beginning of year,"So I would recommend you wait around until the price drops again. There are a lot of pilot watches out there so do your research. This watch is OK, if I had to pick again i'd get one with smaller numbers. My husband also doesnt use the features on the watch because its a pain to use."
4,Great watch for it's price,"Grabbed it for 150$ more than a couple of years ago - they are still my favourite, good glass protection -had it hit accidentially against door handles passing, no scratches so far. Cool looks (better, than on photos), the right weight, the right feet on my thick wrist. The only con is that brown tint on the bracelet became worn on some edges below, but that didn't reduce the total looks so far.I recommend it as an everyday all-rounder for those, who appreciate functionalilty and looks above brand-names."
1,Pulsar PF3183,"The watch took a while to come even though it was suppose to have been sent the next day. It was nothing like what I saw in the store. The bezel around the watch is not moving as it should. So using the slide rule to calcualte anything is out of the question. The watch itself is tight to fit over ones hand. Trying to find anyone who has links or can add links in nearly impossible. The second hand is not realy a second hand but it goes to the stop watch, the real second hand is one of the smile hands on the face of the watch...takes some getting use to. Oh finally setting the date is a real chore. It doesn't go back so you have turn and turn the set knob until you get to the right date. Overall a very poorly designed watch for Sieko who is the parent of PULSAR brand of watches. Stay away go with a Citizen as you will be better off and pleased with the choice...unlike this one."
1,Pulsar Does NOT honor warranty,"Although this watch comes with a 3 year warranty, Pulsar does not honor it. My watch was 11 months old! According to Pulsar you cannot buy this watch from anyone but an ""authorized Pulsar dealer"" or they will not honor the warranty. It does not say this anywhere in their warranty book but that is the type of crooked manufacturer you are dealing with! Stay away from Pulsar."
4,Interesting,"After a stunning ""Nefertiti,"" this album declines a bit in quality and becomes quite derivative. Yes, I've heard Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner too. Tom is very talented, but there is a depth missing. Perhaps it's from all those of years of playing fusion. You'll search in vain for his soul.Drummer Cora Coleman needs to find another line of work.Still, on the whole, interesting. And worth the price."
3,"Griff is back! All in, we're gonna win!","The minister of information is back in effect, with more hip-hop inspired poetry for your mind. The trick-nology of the grafted devils out there holds no danger for Griff. ""Old Azz Trick, Damn You, You'd Better Worry; Duck Down, Ya see Griff Comin' At'cha!"" is the hook from ""Ole Bit*h U Worriez"", where he trades rhymes with Partner 4 Life Chuck D.Give it a chance, y'all! Are you down for the Evolution Revolution?ALLAH U AKBAR"
1,"What an idiot. Nice try, Mista Griff!","As Public Enemy's ""Minister of Information,"" Griff had little more to say than a line or two per album, and a bunch of retarded marching onstage. His first album made a little noise, not due to anything musically, but because his hatred of Jews was printed in a Washington Post interview.Very tired 5% Nation of Islam crap, down with Whitey/Up with Hate. This is really wack, and by Wack, I mean I would rather listen MC Hammer."
5,Incredible tool for DIY or professional plumbers,"I thoroughly enjoy telling the guys at Home Depot and Lowes ""no thanks"" when they tell me I need the $90/ea crimp tools to use PEX fittings. Not only is it an incredible value, it has the additional advantage of allowing crimping at any angle in tight spaces. I have replaced fittings tucked up in the floor joists that would not have been possible with the big crimpers.Also, you'll get a good forearm workout with the vise grips.Thank you for creating this product."
2,Not Great,"I borrowed this crimper from a relative who had not yet used the tool. I attempted approximately 10 crimps on 1/2"" pipe and was only successful on the ones where I could use the ground as a base to push the pliers against. On the crimps where the pipe was already installed in the wall or ceiling I was not able to apply enough pressure to crimp the ring tight enough to get the go guage to slide on. Fortunately I am not out any money and had a friend who has the real crimpers. I used Channel Lock pliers, not Vise Grips as recommended however I don't think it would have made a difference. Unless you are a very strong person and don't mind squuezing until you can't see straight I would not recommend this tool."
3,Garnet/Citrine Pendant-Peora,"Nice necklace, good quality but note that the section of the necklace that hangs on the chain is large and round so it makes the gems fall over when its around your neck. This really needs a thick chain to look right.Heart Pear Cut Garnet Citrine Pendant Sterling Silver"
4,An absorbing mystery,"Abby Conners is stunned when her father, author Jud, is killed in his Oregon lakeshore cabin. Her horror grows deeper, however, when she realizes that someone that Jud knew must have been the murderer. Abby takes a ""novel"" approach to discovering who killed her father by studying his fiction for the first time and realizing some of the deeper secrets contained therein.This mystery was very absorbing and a quick read. A few of the plot devices near the end started to seem a bit contrived for the purpose of the mystery's resolution - when did Abby, an art historian, become a computer specialist? But, overall, the book was excellent. Wilhelm's writing style is wonderful and evocative of the landscape she is trying to capture as well as revealing the personalities of her characters."
1,Poorly written,"Principles of Money, Banking, and Financial Markets contains a great deal of information regarding economics in the United States. As a student, I find it to be poorly written. The authors/editors make constant reference throughout the text to other sections of the text. For example, we will discuss this in depth in chapter seven, but for now, lets reflect our continued study from chapter two and three. By doing so, we will be better prepared to read chapter eleven when we get to it. If the authors / editors left out the references and just left the actual information needed to learn the material, the student would be able to follow the material and perhaps understand the topic better. I am strongly encouraging our economics department to seek another text for future semesters."
5,One of my top ten favorite abums ever!,"I've got ""Dancin the Blues"" and ""Like Never Before"" but I still keep coming back to this album. This album sets me free. I play it constantly and I got it in the seventies. I think Taj is the coolest guy on the planet. Cajun Waltz makes me grab my wife and dance her around the room. His musical sense and timing I can't begin to describe. All the songs are very unique and unlike anything I've ever heard. Give this one a shot. I've never turned anyone on to this album that didn't love it."
4,great stuff,"Yeah I rather love this record although its more the overall mood than that every song is great, but it just flows together so well. this version of slave driver is just fantastic ( and probably better than the original. some of the songs taken in isolation seem weak,why the fadeout on 'johnny too bad'? Some great backing vocals - a short album but such a happy vibe"
1,Overpriced and Oversweet,"I have a friend who thinks their Caramel 7 Layer Cake is the bomb..I have tasted it on three occasions and it is so sweet it is just like pouring caramel over a big spoon of grainy sugar.I was going to purchase one for the holiday for my friend who likes them, but I see the price after shipping is like $80.00+. The way the economy is now, it is ridiculously priced.It is certainly not worth that price tag, but then again I guess the rich can afford it, but I don't see the fascination in these cakes.No thanks."
5,Greates book ever.,I am Rose from Naches Valley Middle School. I think this book was great from the sad moments to happy ones. I would recommened this book to anyone.
2,Dull,"The only redeeming factor of this video was that my muscles felt worked the next day. The male instructor wore what looked like a womens swimsuit, and there were lots of camera shots to his derriere. (understandable, since this is a ""buns"" workout, but it's not for the faint of heart). i give it a B on workout quality, and a D on visuals."
5,VINTAGE METAL,"One of the very best by B.O.C. I suppose, however, I like HARVESTER OF EYES the ON YOUR FEET OR ON YOUR KNEES version better, but this one is very good. In this great sounding CD is my favorite B.O.C. song of all time...FLAMING TELEPATHS!"
4,70's guy,Good tunes.grew up in the 70's listening to this stuff and when I got a gift card for Christmas I had to have it. Good memories
3,Some really good songs among some okay stuff,"Their third album is far from their best, but it does contain some gems. Dominance and Submission, Flaming Telepaths and Astronomy stand out as BOC classics. The rest is mostly mid-tempo rock with the usual sci-fi lyrics - you almost wish they'd go over the top with it like they did on their first classic albums. The production is almost too clean for the band. Probably not the best place to start checking out BOC, but worth a listen if you like their other work."
5,truly a hidden treasure of BOC,"This is truly an unsung hero of rock n roll.Did this CD ever get any air time? I think not,and its ashame,because this is a true classic of heavy metal.Its not thrash or space music,but good old hard rock.There is not one bad song on this CD,the words are a little hard to understand,but SECRET TREATIES rocks just the same."
4,Best or Second Best,"To me this was one of the two best albums BOC ever released. It is raw enough to remind me of the clubs I frequented in the mid-seventies. This is not the commercialized junk you heard on the radio, it is rock from the gut or the soul, wherever the good stuff comes from."
3,"Awesome back in the day, only okay now","M&M; 6 was a blast to play back in the day, but the evolution of the PC RPG has made it almost unplayable today. M&M6; focuses mostly on doing battles in a first-person party-based setup. It uses classical fantasy elements (and a few sci-fi ones) to make a fun game.You get to put points in skills and learn spells for your characters. You'll use those skills and spells to buy gear, kill baddies and venture through dungeons for more gear or to save a lost person.It's alright, but there's tons better these days.If you want to get the game and have a blast from the past, go ahead and buy it."
5,Still playing (occasionally) after all these years,"I bought this game the first day it was available. I rushed home, installed it, found the answer to the question, and sent in in by overnight mail. Yes, I got one of the couple of dozen posters they made for the rollout of Might and Magic VI. I had it framed and it is on my study wall. I upgraded from Win 95 to Win 98 to NT to NT-IV to XP to Vista to Windows-7. But I've always kept a machine running Win 98 (then later Win ME) to play the M&M games. I wore out the game CD and got another. I wore out the old machine and set up another to run ME. Now, my ME-2000 machine won't run anymore. It is still fun to get out once in a while and run a new team through for a ways. Does anybody know how to run it under Windows-7?"
4,MM6,For being a game made in 98 it is very Intricate. Can get frustrating at times though. Had to walk away a few times.
4,Might and Magic VI Review,Might and Magic 6: Mandate of Heavenhas given me many hours of enjoyment. The challenges in the game play provided satisfaction when my battle weary troop made it home alive.I even prefer this game to the 3 versions that followed it.
5,A great resource,This is a great book to dive into helping people work through their sexual addiction. A lot of work that goes on today in the field is based on this resource.
5,I Love Lucy...and this book!,"This book is perfect for the I Love Lucy fan!!! My 25-year-old daughter (who swears she was born in the wrong decade) adores Frank Sinatra, black and white movies and Lucy. She requested the DVD set of the 2nd season of Lucy for Christmas. As I was looking online for the set, I ran across this book. It is FULL of pictures - hundreds of pictures and interesting facts about some of the most popular episodes, as well as personal photos of Lucy, Desi and their children, etc. It is a wonderful coffee-table book and is sure to spark conversations of favorite episodes. Can't wait to give this to her...she is going to love it!!! Highly recommended."
5,make sure you see this movie!!,"i went to see this movie yesterday and bought the soundtrack immediately. all i can say that this movie HAS to be seen--it is an amazing mixture of elation, music, rhythm and intense sadness, with amazing acting and singing by bjork. she must be one of the most innovative voices in music today, mixing basic rhythms with lush orchestral arrangements (check out her last 2 amazing cd's) and beautiful melodies. make sure you see the movie first (you will not be sorry)!!!"
4,Soundtrack (?),"This is the first Bjork cd i've purchased since the second sugarcubes album came out in the late '80's. I bought it a couple weeks after seeing Dancer in the Dark, largely because a couple of the musical segments in the film were so haunting. Though I'm very happy to own the cd, i am disappointed that several of the songs are subtly but significantly different from the versions in the movie; in particular i missed the chorus of railroad workers on ""I've Seen Everything,"" Joel Grey on ""In the Musicals,"" and a few other touches in the film that were important to my appreciation of the music. I do hope they issue a soundtrack that is faithful to the film version; if they do, I'll pick it up in an instant, and pass this version on to a friend. Again, the differences are very minor, but they make a difference to me."
4,This CD was good...,"I just bought this CD and finished my first listen to it. It wasn't bad... however, it was unlike anything I have heard from Bjork before. In fact, if this album were not by Bjork, I would have had no inclination to buy it, because the style of music is not a style that I am particularly fond of.Unlike the reviewer before me, I can't see how this CD is revolutionary in any way. The songs are beautiful, but not extraordinary.I guess I just prefer a light hearted and yet intense, trippy Bjork. This music is a little too ""epic"" feeling and mellow for my tastes. However, with Bjork's beautiful voice, even an album of nursery rhymes would receive four stars from me."
2,I was disappointed,"I'm a moderate Bjork fan, and I've especially enjoyed her work with the Sugarcubes. But this CD, I must admit, I didn't like much at all. First off, there's the price vs. number of songs problem. It's WAY overpriced for 7 songs. But beyond that, there was only one song that I really enjoyed (the duet with the singer from Radiohead). Some of the songs on here are just crap, and make no sense unless you've seen the movie (I presume). For example, there's one song where she's basically just counting. My guess is that has something to do with dancing, but as a single listening to it in your car, there's not much appeal. This CD isn't worth the money as far as I'm concerned. You're better off with Debut, or the Great Crossover Potential (by the Sugarcubes). Stay away from selmasongs, or just get the one good song off Napster (it's not worth the money)."
3,amazing woman,"totally frustrated, after listening to sample of all the albums and the wonderful Charlie Rose session with Bjork, I couldn't wait to ""buy"" an album. I want a certain experience of listening to her as being typical of her enormous talent. Like a signature, as when you listen to Dave Brubecks ""Take The A Train""...it kind of says it all about Brubecks music that he wants to share with his audience , and you know you want to buy the album. Her talent and voice are incredibly interesting...would like to see her sometime in a live performance!"
2,only a big fan should by this,"I was excited to see a new album by Bjork in the store today. However, after buying it and listening to it some I am no longer as excited. This is not a very interesting disc. The music basically is made up of ""experimental"" type electronic sounds (which, by now, are not too experimental) and orchestration. The songs themselves do not have much in the order of melody. Bjork's voice is still here of course, but being her fifth release, is that really enough to hold anyone's attention? Adding to the annoyance, there is some guy singing with Bjork on one of the tracks. And to top it all off, the disc is 32 minutes long!! If you are a die hard Bjork fan you'll probably want this. (Whether or not you'll like it is a different question.) If you are new to Bjork, check out ANYTHNING else by her, probably one of the first two. This thing is a waste of money."
2,Not that great.,Maybe you need to see the movie first? I don't know but with only seven songs/orchestrations and being an aligned piece (The songs fit within a framework.) I decided that I should have gone with another selecton from Bjork's catalog as my introductory. I was dissapointed both with the individual songs and the work as a whole.
1,ridiculous,"Don't know if this album just goes to prove that Bjork's prior great moments were flukes, or not. Whatever, this album is desperately in need of some decent songcraft. Frankly, tracks like I've Seen It All are ridiculous to the point of being hysterically funny."
1,can bjork sing...or act? NOPE!,hearing bjork sing is like X-Men's wolverine putting his metal claws THROUGH THE BLACKBOARD and pulling down the slate! this is an awful cd and DANCER IN THE DARK is a godawful musical. she won best actress at cannes? puh-leez!
4,Great movie and soundtrack...,"This soundtrack goes to prove the ability of bjork. Overture in itself shows some of the best compositional prowess of our era, but add that to the rest of this soundtrack and you begin to understand how amazing Bjork truly is. The only complaint I have is the exclusion of the most moving and powerful song in the movie. The decision to exclude this track is a great misdeed to Bjork's singing ability as it is the single greatest representation of her vocal abilities ever recorded. Listening to her completely A Capella not only wrenches your heart if you have seen the movie, but also completely haunts the soul even if you do not understand the contextual meaning. Overall a great soundtrack to accompany one of the best movies I have ever seen."
5,The best thing Bjork has ever done!-and that say A LOT,It is short but nothing short of absolutely beautiful (and I don't use that word often). It absolutely kills me everytime. If it had the acappella version of New World from the end of Dancer in the Dark I wouldn't be able to listen to it without breaking down. Such an amazing movie and such staggering music. Life altering.
4,A masterwork,"The power of the narrative of Lars Von Trier's DANCER IN THE DARK, in which Bjork starred (and performed these songs), seems to have driven the Icelandic alternative queen in her creation of one of the most haunting movie musical scores of all time. Although a soundtrack more congruent with the actual movie might have been more satisfying, thankfully the brilliant ""Overture"" has been included. (See the movie for an awe-inspiring art sequence as the grand overture plays). Bjork has not been given nearly enough credit for pulling together a magnificent, emotional, vastly colorful work of art in this album."
4,"Brilliant, but not complete","I agree with the other reviewers: I'd prefer the movie soundtrack over this version--much as I like Thom's vocal over the original Jeff's voice!; I'd prefer the movie's version of Scatterheart and In the Musicals, starring Joel Grey's voice additions, over the CD version; I also didn't like to pay full price for an EP (but I'll do it this time, thinking there may not be another recording of this spellbinding music). But let me add a new point to this ongoing discussion......Broadway?If Paul Simon, Pete Townsend and Elton John can do it--Billy Joel has recently been approached to do the same--perhaps Bjork might expand the score a bit and put this dark vision on Broadway. I think that might be awesome.So Bjork...will there be an original cast album coming? Or at the very least, a more complete and original movie soundtrack coming?"
4,Bjork does it - -AGAIN!!,"Bjork is an amazing artist always making herself into a bridge so that we can step out onto it and view her deep and intricate valley. I have been a listener since purchasing her DVD Volumen online, and cannot say how much I appreciate her music. However, with Selmasongs, you get an extremely personal view of Bjork's interpretation of who Selma (from the film) really is. The music may seem stark and rather depressing but the more you listen the further you get into Selma and Bjork's artistry. And also, this CD is rather short, but it is so pakced with artistry that it makes up for it's brevity. And didn't Shakespeare write ""brevity is the soul of wit""?. However, purchase this CD if you are a fan or even if you want to begin to enjoy this amazing lyricist and musician."
4,well... Homogenic was awesome...,"Maybe I'm giving this CD a preliminary review. Bjork's stuff, more than any other artist, has to grow on you. It demands multiple listenings. I haven't listened to this album repeatedly like i have with Post and Homogenic, but Bjork really scores with a sort of techno musical, really modern and inventive. I saw the movie a few weeks ago, and liked it... maybe if you see the movie first and then listen to the CD you will have a different opinion. Can't wait for her new studio album next year."
5,you're gonna have to find out for your seeeelf,"hello. selmasongs is the first thing we have seen from bjork since her 1997 lp homogenic was released. three long years, and wow.. was it worth the wait. selmasongs is not at all what i expected. i downloaded cvalda weeks before the cd was released. it had a sugarcubes feel to it, and i got very excited. while the whole cd does not have the same energy that cvalda has, it gives a pretty rush down my spine. the duet with thom yorke from radiohead is oustanding. the lyrics.. are a masterpiece as well. ""You've never been to Niagara Falls? I have seen water, its water, that's all..."" and scattheart. my dearest scatterheart. the movie makes the soundtrack that much more... emotional. buy the soundtrack, see the movie. it is worth it.""There is comfort Right in the eye Of the hurricane Just to make it easier on you"""
2,Dissapointing but still classic Bjork greatness,"These songs are great n all like everything Bjork does (in my opinion), but i fell in love with the film and the film's soundtrack and this is not the film's soundtrack. All of the songs are redone. My favorite song for instance is ""I've Seen It All"" and i get Thom Yorke instead of Jeff(Peter Stormare). Love Thom and all but prefer Jeff for sentimental ties i have with the film. and Scatterheart?!? None of the lyrics are even the same and Bill(David Morse) and Linda(Cara Seymour) are not singing! The others are the same story.. Isn't the whole point of a musical the fact that a bunch of people in the movie are singing in context with the plot? If you listened to the soundtrack you'd never guess it was the soundtrack to a musical.. Anyway the songs are great but it's not really a soundtrack to me and i can't help but be very dissapointed and sad that i can't have the songs i want other than having to listen to the film."
3,I Feel Ripped Off!,"Why? I purchased this CD at an HMV store for much higher price plus a significant discount and the total was still more expensive than Amazon! Plus, I think the CD tracks, which are slightly different from the film tracks, don't pack the same type of power and intensity. However, I still enjoy the album and the film was BRILLIANT! There just wasn't enough Bjork to go around. Plus, the next to last track on the film (if you saw it you'll know what I mean) isn't on the track; I felt that was a pivotal song in the film. Perhaps my expecations were too high. With artists like Bjork, I can't just listen to them, I have to experience them. If you buy the CD, buy it on Amazon and save money! Personally, I'm going to wait for the film to come out on video."
2,It's Oh So Tired,"Björk is the freshest, most inventive, significant and exciting artist to come along in popular music since the 1960s. Each album, from Gling Glo onwards, is more more creative, ground-breaking and delightful than the previous one. Even her remix album, Telegram, is striking for the originality of the alternate versions of her songs. Well, no one can keep it up forever. Maybe this is a good soundtrack, but as an album in its own right, it's a tired rehash of old musical themes. None of her usual artful teasing, sensual playing with noise and vocal tones. It's formula Björk, if such a thing is possible.If you're shopping for Björk CDs, start with Post, Debut and Homogenic (in that order). Get this one only if you, like me, get so hooked that you have to buy everything, regardless of merit."
3,Simone Kermes edition?,"I totally agreed with the review of David A. Boxwell, and I just would like to say something about the soprano that il Complesso Barocco and A. Curtis have been imposing in their Handel projects. Simone Kermes has a pretty voice, and she is a virtuoso singer indeed, but she does not have many possibilities for dramma: the voice is colorless, almost white, and this Handel operas need a voice with temperament... All the projects include this singer, they are now recording Rodelinda, again with S. Kermes... Why haven't they invited sopranos like Dorothea Röschmann, Luba Orgonasova, Inga Kalna, even Patrizia Ciofi (to name just a few), to any of these projects? I have nothing against S. Kermes, but when you are doing a major project you cannot depend on the same singer for every single work, there are several sopranos around that can make justice to a Handel Opera, and the public needs also other options."
5,Rare Handel,"This is a Handel rarity that appeared in adverts and promos, but seems to have been available elsewhere, but not here. By today's standards the libretto was a rather silly hodge-pode of stock characters and standard operatic situations. It is the music that carries the opera. Props should go to the team that Alan Curtis has put together for this recording. The solists are mostly excellent and the instrumentalists are lead by Curtis inan excellent all-around performance. My hope is that Curtis will record Scipione and Alessandro, two other Handel rarities, as well."
3,Desperdício,"Hummm...grande desperdício essa gravao de Lotario de Handel, no pela música -uma ópera belíssima, no pelos cantores - jovens e promissores (Kermes, Prina e Summers, principalmente), mas pela infeliz idéia de Curtis de cortar árias e ""da capos""...Mas a regncia está ótima; Kermes e Mingardo formam uma unio de vozes perfeitas, e o elenco de apoio é talentoso...Uma grande pena..."
5,How to analyze the paranormal,"This book was used in my Psychology of the Paranormal class. It is a useful tool to help people learn to think critically about thier own thoughts and the thoughts of others. Included within it are basic fallacies, common arguments for the paranormal and against it, and other useful psychological information concerning how we make sense of the world. A must read for anyone serious about examining paranormal phenomena of any kind."
4,This is pretty much an ideal boombox!,"It has fabulous sound! I couldn't even turn it up 3/4 of the way before my neighbors called to compalin (no i'm kidding). But it was loud that my dad's office could hear it. But pretty much an ideal.... It doesn't have a headphone jack there, which is kinda annoying, it'd be great with that fabulous sound. But that's the only thing wrong... Rewinding and Fast Fowarding are normal, Radio quality is outstanding! GET IT!"
5,One of the Greatest Albums of All Time,"I have listened to a lot of music in my life - that's basically what I do. I first heard this album in an Econo Lodge in New Haven, CT surrounded by new friends and a bottle of whiskey. The joy in hearts when 313 came on is unique and will be with me forever - ""Take my life if you are able, I don't want to be here when they come to take me in"" sung with pop hooks and a jazz beat, brought tears to my eyes. The rest of the album is just as stunning. Sun Machine is a mastery of controlled power using rythm chords to a manifest pure joy and freedom. Even though this album won the Jammy album of the yeaar in 2000 it is still largely unheard and deserves more attention. The members of PH are pure muscians and people in touch with the rythm of the universe."
4,Very details,"I read the first edition of this book, it's good with explanations about the installation of Nagios, the plugins, the relation (parents, host/service dependence), active & passive monitoring, remote host monitor, and so much more. This book and Pro Nagios 2.0 (which is very good for beginner) are two must-have books for network & system monitoring."
3,Which is the current version?,"I borrowed this book, with this cover and the publication date is 2001, not 2010. There is a second version listed with a different cover showing a 2001 date in the Amazon listing. It's possible that one is the newer version but there is no way of knowing. This book is good with a lot of good information. I'm only giving it a 3 stars because some of the information is dated and no longer valid. I was hoping to find an updated version to buy because if the necessary updates were included it would be a really good book (possibly 4 stars)."
4,A Valuable Garden Tool!,"This book has been incredibly useful to me. The information is well organized, if a little incomplete, and the pictures are inspiring. An excellent resource for any organic gardener."
1,Not as good as Rodale's version,"This book just doesn't cut it when compared to other similar text like Rodale's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Organic GardeningThere is nothing particularly wrong with the book. It has the requisite parts such as a discussion of organic gardening, the reasons for it, and why you should use it. It also has a fairly good chapter on various vegetables and how to grow them. It's just not my first choice for a reference book. I was highly disappointed with having picked this book first and then finding the Rodale book later.Save a couple bucks and go with the Rodale book instead."
5,wouldnt' it be loverly!,"Filmed live at the club erics this tape is sensational. The color is warm, the presentation of the quartette brings you right into the nightclub. Composer, arranger, soloist on that huge baritone-about the size of a tyrolean mountain horn, mulligan is deft as Charlie Parker and the solos are pure bliss. Plus the three trio musicians, especially pianist Harold Danko, are terrific. Ironic in that Mulligan was famous for not including piano. Danko, not well known but spent time as Chet Baker's pianist, he should be much more wellknown. If you love great jazz, and Mulligan hits it just blissfully, then you must include this in your ""stuff""!."
5,Peter Nero ~ As Good As Ever!,Peter Nero's Greatest Hits now digitally mastered on CD is as great as the LP ever was! Familiar but still thrilling overtures from our past. Nobody gets the rhythm or titilating piano any better than Peter Nero!
5,Good quality,"CD was a good quality, and it shipped quickly. I would surely purchase from this vendor again in the future."
1,Yuch!,"Better than nothing and may be a good product if it was 10 years ago but in this day and age of advanced software it stinks! Detail is sketchy, print outs come out nothing like what you see on the screen. The printed directions are ok but the maps are close to worthless and you would much rather use your hard copy map even if they are a pain to refold!Hey Rand McNally! Improve it will ya!"
5,Could have gone another step beyond...,"on the packaging. Great tunes and contains many videos that I haven't seen before. My only complaint is the packaging. While the cardboard cd sleeves look great, they tend to be abrade the hard to remove cd's. The liner notes seemed skimpy as well."
5,missle to the moon,this is great 1950 it should be in every body collection there is something about it thats so great and the ideas with the rock people and other things in the movie if you got 120IQ or higher its worth having in your collection.
1,Missile to the moon,Not a bad sort of film in a cheesy kind of way but I have yet to see a transfer to either vhs or dvd that was of minimally good quality. The editing in the movie transfer looks like it was done with a hacksaw. There are abrupt jumps in the editing of the film and over all the effect vastly diminishes from the viewing enjoyment even of such a cheesy film as this one. My recommendation to everybody who is interested in buying this product is for them to wait until there is a good quality version transfer of this movie.
3,Bodacious Lunar Amazons And The Feeble Earthmen Who Love Them...,"We desperately need to get another moon mission together, RIGHT NOW! The place is crawling w/ statuesque moon babes! Send me today! I surrender! They can have me! Ahem.... anyway, MISSILE TO THE MOON involves a team of space explorers (including two escaped cons) who land on the moon, get chased by lumbering rock-monsters, and find a cave filled w/ precious oxygen (!). Not only this, but the cave leads to a hidden city populated by beautiful models in high-heels and one-piece bathing suits! Their leader, or ""Lido"", is a cross between Auntie Mame, Liberache, and Medusa in her titanic head-dress! Cathy Downs, the lone female earthling, is vexed and intimidated by the moon's high estrogen level. She must fight for her man while looking smart in her pearl necklace and earrings! Alas, the males have fallen under the spell of the lunar ladies! What will become of them? MTTM proves once and for all that the moon truly is made of cheese..."
4,Don't Miss this Flight!!,"This is a classic in the ""so bad it's good"" canon. Almost every aspect of this film is poorly realized, and it thereby has a kind of sub-genre ""purity"" about it. The special effects are far from acceptable under any other circumstances. Costumes are a camp spectacular, especially those of the Moon Women and their ""Lido"" with her ludicrous head gear. Monsters consist of the (very slowly) walking rocks and that giant spider with visible wires who got a lot of work in the late 50s as the inhabitant of many caves and planets.Best of all, though, is the acting. Every cast member, without exception, is inept. Even handsome Gary Clarke, who later showed he had talent, is awful here. But the Anti-Oscar surely must go to Cathy Downs for her brilliant portrayal of an Earth woman among Lunar rivals. As they lead her to her doom in the jaws of the giant spider, she cries out: ""No! Don't!""See this movie for a truckload-o-laughs."
4,Missle To The Moon,I have looked for this movie along time. I love old SciFi movies. Even though it is corny and we know that you cannot get to the moon in one day. It is still a good movie for those of us who love old scifi.
3,IMAGE EDITION!!!!!,"The Image edition could have been better. While the print looked good overall, the occasional print damage and splices with missing bits of dialogue were not."
3,average on the B movie scale; fun and funny,"This movie is pretty decent if you're into this kind of stuff. The acting is corny, in a humorous and entertaining sort of way. The cheesy effects are great! The rock monsters are pretty cool, and the giant spider is totally hilarious. The spider is the best part of the movie. It just has to be seen to be believed! There are also some very sexy moon women to look at. B movie fans should definitely check this one out."
5,My absolute favourite childhood picture book!,"I can't believe I found a listing of this book! A number of years ago I searched all over the Internet and although I was pretty sure I had the title right, all I could come up with was ""Jemima Puddle Duck"" by Beatrix Potter. What's not to love about this beautiful children's story? Of all the books my parents read to me as a child, this one stands out the most vividly for its gentle story line, its rich and beautiful illustrations, and, well, its overall cuteness. My children know this story from what I remember (by ear) and ask for it frequently as a bedtime story. Unfortunately it's out of print and I've never seen a secondhand copy, despite searching many thrift stores. If you ever see a copy somewhere, grab it!"
5,Maybe Gamera is the new King of the Monsters?,"I love Godzilla, but Gamera has rapidly moved to a challenging position for the kaiju throne. First, there was ""Gamera: Guardian of the Universe"". A terrific film full of amazing special effects, a cool story, and some slambang, knockdown, city smashing monster action.And now, there's this film. It meets and exceeds G:GATU in every respect. The story is interesting. The monsters are fun. And the special effects rock. The most interesting aspect of the film is how humanity must put aside its fear of Gamera to work alongside the titanic turtle to save the earth from deadly aliens.Gamera has huge heroic presence. I know that's odd to say about a guy in a rubber suit, but damnit, I stick to it. When I see that turtle soaring through the air I just want to cheer. And the Legion are some scary looking alien bugs, especially the formidable master kaiju of the swarm.An exceptional film, top-to-bottom."
5,The best monster series ever.,"If you think this is the best, wait for Gamera3, that movie has some of the best cg I've ever seen in this type of movie, with a compelling story too. It's terrific that Gamera2 is finally coming out in America, I knew there was a reason I didn't buy the bootleg on ebay. The great thing about Gamera (besides the excellent effects) is that it's a monster movie that you can take seriously, it doesn't go for the cheap and cheesy thrills like most of the Godzilla films, but wraps up the impressive action in a compelling story. This is definitely one of the most fun movies I've seen, and thank god it comes with a Japanese language track on the dvd."
3,I wanted to like this more...,"...but the movie feels like a rush job. The special effects did not impress me all that much and the characters spent most of the movie running after or from the monsters. This entry sadly lacks a human element and the Gamera Girl from the first is utterly wasted here. Yes the movie has some nifty moments in it, but after seeing the first Gamera and how well its director Shusuke Kaneko handled his take on Godzilla, I was expecting so much more. On a more up positive note, the disc is crammed with juicy extras. Kaiju fans will enjoy it, just keep in mind that its just another sequel that is not equal to the first."
2,bad and miss leading,i got this movie today and it wouldnt work in my dvd player so i toke it to see if it needed to get fix it was fine just it only works on the computer so check the info and buyers beware!!!!!!!
3,Good but NOT the Best Kaiju,"It's about time ADV got around to releasing Shusuke Kaneko's trilogy of Gamera films. If you want an above-average giant monster fest, by all means check out Gamera 2. Like all other films in this genre including Godzilla, the insistence on using rubber suits and model miniatures limits the believability and increases the campiness.But if you want to experience the pinnacle of kaiju, you have to wait for Gamera 3, Revenge of Iris. It is, by far, the best giant monster movie made."
1,don't bother,"I am thankful that this book was free because I just downloaded it to read. One page only and it says ""this title is out of print"". If it is out of print, then remove it from Amazon - don't leave it on for people to download, then have to delete it, or worse yet ... purchase it and waste their time (and Amazon's time) to get a refund."
4,Worth the read,"I really enjoyed this book, it mixed mystery, romance, and suspense all together and kept me wanting to read more and more. I wasn't expecting much from this book but I am glad I decided to read it!"
5,My high school did this play,"I have been looking for the soundtrack to this musical for quite a while. I am so excited to have found it! I just love it! I fell in love with the musical when I went to see my high school's rendition of it when I was still in eighth grade. I was captivated by the way they painted everybody gray and stuff so that it looked like you were watching black and white TV, and the music was totally awesome."
4,No ENglish subtitle,"How can there is not even an English subtitle? Though it doesn't quite stand in the way of my understanding, it still almost drove me mad while I was watching.Many of my friends, who are also hot EFC fans, withdrew their decision of buying it when they knew there wasn't a subtitle. Not everyone's(I mean people from non-English speaking countries like me)English is good enough to understand the show without any means of assistance."
4,Catchy Rock...engaging!,"Dead Poetic returns after ""Four Wall Blackmail"" with a more acccessible release. There is still an abundant amount of screaming, however, the writing, production, and music is more mature. Nothing innovative, but not ""trendy"" and still underground. Picks--""Taste the Red Hands"", ""Molotov"", ""Hostages"", ""Vanus Empty"""
3,"LONG LIVE ""FOUR WALL BLACKMAIL""","Before you even think about buying this Dead Poetic album, make sure you buy FOUR WALL BLACKMAIL (or as I call it ""4WB"")for the biggest reason: You will be a fan of Dead Poetic and will enjoy BAD MEDICINES, if your don't, you might not like this band or even understand thier style. If I bought this CD before 4WB or never bought 4WB, I woulda cast this band into the trashcan, but there is one reason why you know this: On 4WB, Dead Poetic establishes their cred with the Punk (esp. Hardcore) scene with the song ""THE CORPORATE ENTHUSIAST"" and then sooth the doomsayers-soul with ""AUGUST WINTERMAN""... Heck, I went to a show at a club when they were performing ""The Corporate Enthusiast"" and recieved a concussion-inducing kick to the head in the Pit!!! Another good thing about Dead Poetic is that I gave a copy to a depressed friend of mine, and he is much happier in his life because of DP! Thanks DP and Jesus! This album NEW MEDICINES is only for the DP devotees, seriously."
5,Fabulous Songwriting,"A couple reviewers have said that New Medicines was not as ""catchy"" or ""strong"" as 4 Wall Blackmail....but if you look at this from a songwriting standpoint, NM FAR surpasses 4WB. The melodies are perfect. They were catchy in 4WB, but somewhat monotonous. The guitars are much better too. They may not have that brutal punch they got from working with Barry Poynter, but I think Aaron Sprinkle really did bring the best out of these guys. They are all immensely talented as individual musicians and as a band. The guitar, bass, and drumwork are thick, juicy, and amazing. The vocals could not be better. There is not as much screaming, and it's better that way, I don't care what anyone else says. If you don't have this CD, get it. Glass in the Trees, Dream Club Murders, and Vanus Empty will rock your face off."
4,very good cd love it,this cd has awsome tracks with incredible emotion flowing through every song... get this cd
2,Mediocre at best,"Dead Poetic's debut album Four Wall Blackmail was something else. It kicked some life into the tired genre of hardcore emo. Dead Poetic's live performences and the excellent first CD prompted me to buy Mew Medicines without listening to any of it first, as is my usual rite for buying music. So I spent the 15 dollars and popped it into my stereo. I'm fairly disappointed. While they lyrics are a step above most of the other band's out today, the music and vocals are about on par with if not a little below bands like Thursday, Finch, etc. It's not a bad CD at all. But it's not terribly good either. Hopefully with their next release we'll see the intensity we did with Four Wall Blackmail, until then spend your money elsewhere."
2,Buy Four Wall Blackmail Instead,"if you loved Four Wall Blackmail, you'll most likely be dissappointed. DP has been my favorite band for over a year. I've seen them 6 times live and they are amazing. However, this album cost me fourteen dollars that I wish I hadn't spent. It sounds so...radio. If that's what you like then you'll probably love it. It reminds me of something like Good Charlotte only some great screaming (very little). I'll probably still go to their shows and lose my flip flops in the pit, but I'll be sad when they play their new stuff. DP stop trying to get big and do what you do best. Rawk."
1,"eh, so so","Alright its better than one star, but that is there to bring the average rating down. This is NOT a 5 out of 5 cd. It is well performed and somewhat catchy, and the singing is good. I, however, was expecting something much better. The screaming is very good when used, but it is not used enough nor always at the right parts of the song. The album also sounds overproduced at times, fake and not true to the live sound of the band. Although this album is not bad, it lacks originality and punch. It can be summarized in 4 words: Story of the Year. This band sounds VERY similar to SOTY, other than the harder style of screaming. I would honestly rate it a 3 star, but like I said, the average rating needed to be lowered. It is worth listening to, but there are much better bands in this genre."
1,No Stars to a band w/not talent,This A-W-F-U-L cd was released by the T&N record company and wow I was disappointed w/there 1st cd and when I listened to a few tracks of this I was even more dissapointed! This band is a dissapointment and I thought they might actually have grown up from there 1st cd but I guess not. Look for some kind of remixed or remastered verision of this crap. Not wroth the money but if you get a burned copy I won't look down upon you for having this crap!
5,absolutely awesome,"i first started listening to dead poetic when i came across one of their songs about 2 years ago accidently on kazaa. their music is amazing and NEW MEDICINES is one of the best sophmore albums i've ever heard. it encompasses the sound of FOUR WALL BLACKMAIL, but this time around they diversify a bit more to make an all around amazing cd. the lyrics are heartfelt and the screaming is the best i've ever heard. i recommened this cd to everyone who's willing to listen because once you start, you won't be able to stop!"
5,Looking at Maps and Globes,"Carmen Bredeson has written a very good introduction to maps and globes. Covers such topics as legends, directions, and scale. The writing and the book design are clear and clean. The illustrations and photographs are of good quality, but I wished there had been more photos taken specifically for this book as oppose to stock photos. There is an index. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
5,Good Bit,"Just like all the other Freud bits I own, this one works great straight from the package. No tearout with crisp, clean edges. I will continue to buy Freud router bits."
5,Exceptional musical version of Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun,"I saw this production on Broadway and was blown away. I hadn't read (or seen) the source play at the time but the emotional depth and poignancy of this musical has stayed with me for years. I've since read the play and seen the film and both, play and musical, are incredible works. (Interestingly, the musical writers have kept very closely to the words Lorraine Hansberry wrote in their lyrics.) All that said, this is an incredible recording with expressive vocals and powerful orchestrations. Isn't the time right for a revival of Raisin?"
5,Glad I replaced Blade,"I wasn't sure if I needed to replace the blade or not. It wasn't that bad of a shave. But I also knew the blade was 2 years old with very little use. My father used it for maybe 100 shaves. I replaced foil and blade and glad I did. I wasn't sure if these were exact matches or not when I ordered, but it was an exact match."
5,Big Improvement,"After changing the blade on my Panasonic razor, it shaves as close as a Gillette Fusion. It was an excellent investment,"
4,exact replacement,the blades were an exact match and simple to switch out. After 2 years of razor use the raplacement was much needed and it really made it feel like a brand new razor. Amazon was the cheapest I found so overall happy with the purchase.
3,It Does The Job,"I just replaced these blades with the originals. You can see they are not designed as well as the originals. I will not get 7 years out of these blades. While the shave is better than my worn out blades, it is not by much. Guess I will have to stock up on Lectric Shave. BTW, this shaver is awesome and I am still on the original batteries."
2,Not that good,I bought these because of the price. I can see why I should of paid more to get something like the original. they do cut just not very well. Takes too long...I have to shave over the same spot until all my hair is cut.
5,better than the original,"I got the blades for my razor I purchased at Amazon three years ago and popped them in just to test and got the best shave I've ever had with an electric razor. I'm 65 years old and have a heavy beard so I couldn't believe that without water or pre electric stuff shave was great, best ever with an electric and close to non electric.I thought the razor was dying as had to spend a lot of time and go over and over to get mediocre shave but it was the blades. I'm getting another pair now that i realize how this shaver should work. It never, never, since day one, shaved this close."
5,Wayne Dyer's 101 ways...,"I think this is a fantastic, life changing CD, for a person who wants to feel better about him/herself and interact with others without friction. I keep in in the CD player in my car and listen to it frequently when I commute or just travel around. Highly recommend it for anyone who wants to be happier and worry free. (bought 5 copies for my family)"
2,101 ways,I ordered this cd at the advise of my sister. I feel that it is for a person who has a religious/spiritual way of beliefs. I passed it on to a friend.
5,A beautiful tape,"I agree with some of the other views here, this is simply the most inspiring audio tape I've come across. I've been listening to it regularly during the past 18 months and haven't failed to be uplifted each time; Wayne Dyer explains his transforming thoughts with real warmth and love. Beautiful."
5,Life Changing for Real,"Dr Dyer has given us a very simple way to truly transform our lives. I know that I listened to this CD for a solid month and the universe changed around me. I found a very lucrative job, a way to financial peace and a way of life that brings me great joy and peace. It is a priceless recording that will, if you listen and change the way you think, transform your life into a beautiful journey. NAMASTE"
3,too much repetition,"This review is a heads up to people who have ""been on the spiritual path"" (so to speak) for awhile. Although I enjoy much of Dyer's work, this CD was a disappointment. Maybe I've been studying spirituality and metaphysics too long at this point, but it felt like going back to spiritual grade school.Still, I would not give it 3 stars based on only that. This CD lacked editing. Of the 101 things, I would say 40-50% were basically repetition of the same concepts, with very slightly different wording over and over. And number 86 (I think it was), was an EXACT repetition, word for word - an error that could have been easily caught.Other than that, I was surprised how ""religous"" his statements came across, with undertones of shaming and lessons geared toward biblical commandments. Not to put that down (every teaching is valuable to a certain group of students), but to let you know in case it's not what you are looking for."
2,The Cost Says It!,"This isn't a great film, however there are much worse. The story about a newspaper reporter on a spaceship filled with ""cosmonauts"" tends to kind of plod along. When they have to defend the earth against total destruction, the story gets a little more interesting. But then it bogs down again.What really caused me to give this such a low rating is not the film itself, but the quality of the DVD. The source print is full of splices. And even worse, this film is in ""color,"" as it is so proudly described on the box. However, there is so little color left in the print, that it almost looks black and white. In fact, it would have been easier to watch in black and white!"
5,"A RARE gem, beautiful gift to children...","I wish there were more story CDs like this one. My 5 yr old son does not watch television but I do occasionally let him listen to story tapes & CDs when I'm busy and need a break. Wow. He loves this and begs to listen to it over and over. It's as if he were begging me to let him eat spinach salad. This is a treasure and I would highly recommend it for children ages 5 and up. For boys, there's lots of adventure but it is communicated with such mystery and beauty. Classic literature + beautiful classical guitar...it doesn't get any better than this."
4,A 1st in a trilogy of high adventure!,This is some of Axler's best storytelling with raw adventure. You need to read this one folks!
5,There is no one like Margaret Atwood,"This is one of my favorite Margaret Atwood books; I got so many good recommendations on other works of literature from her essays and reviews in this book. She is always a tonic, and I guess I've never read anyone more sophisticated. For me, it all started with ""Oryx and Crake,"" recommended by Judge Posner, and I never went back after that, reading all I could by Margaret Atwood."
3,OK,This is the standard product for our VoIP PBX Telephone System and so we must utilize these particular devices. Will continue to utilize until a better choice becomes available for our environment.
2,98 Degrees...,"This song has gotta be one of their worst, I usually like 98 degrees, but this, I don't like it much, when I hear the beginnig I always think it's an Enreque Eglasius song. My friend noticed that when Nick sings , not the chorus, but at the end of almost every verse it sounds like hes running out of breath, and that like gets to me now whenever I hear it, it's annoying! This is a latin song, so if ya like latin, youll like this...maybee."
2,This is unexplainable!,"Okay. I have to admit that Give Me Just One Night (Una Noche) was really annoying the first time I saw the video and heard the song. I hoped it would sound better to me in the upcoming dayz but lo and behold, I still hate it. It's too repetitive! And let's face it, guys, you would be better off doing music that you did before than this so-called Latin number. The only people who do Latin in the best way are people who have Latin blood in them, so please go back to where you came from."
1,False Advertisement by vendor,"Vendor, Quick Supply, advertises this product as Made in USA on the website. When received, no indication of where it was made so called the manufacturer. Manufacturer confirmed Made in China. When tried to return the product, vendor ignored requests for a return label. The product may be great, but the vendor, Quick Supply, is not."
4,Worth it for one song...,This album has the definitive All Along The Watchtower. All others pale in comparison. Jimmie and Bob and Dave Mathews and the other wannabes can all get in line...
3,A nice selection,"I needed some classical music for my wedding so I pruchased this CD and it is very nice.I also purchased ""Classical Wedding Traditions"" (also from amazon.com) I really like that CD too."
3,Classical Bach Wedding Music,"My fiance and I bought this because we enjoy classical music and wanted to use it for music selection. It has good variety and allowed us to pick our favorites. We will probably use a more orchestrally rich recording for the actual music to be played during the wedding. The price was right and the quality was good, just not excellent."
4,Good selection,"CD has a good selection of songs, particularly for a formal wedding; however the last 5 songs on my CD were garbled so I can't evaluate those.Worth the money, and I would buy again (hoping that the entire CD was clear and easy to understand."
5,Excellent resource for wedding planners,"I work regularly with people planning church weddings who want the service to be dignified, traditional and formal. Often they have ""ear memory"" of music they've heard in other weddings, but no idea about its composer or title. This CD is the best compilation I've found of music that fits those requirements. Selections include great music and performances make it easy to imagine how they would sound in a particular church or other setting. Includes works by Protestant, Catholic and secular composers."
3,A Good Source of Ideas But ...,"The best I can say about this CD is that there are many different styles represented & one can at least get a sense of which pieces merit further investigation. My overall impression is that most of the selections are given a heavy-handed treatment(one might say ultra-formal) or are downright silly--I could swear I've heard 2 of the tracks in Disney's Electrical Parade. I don't blame the composer, of course, but the arranger & compiler. I'm planning my own wedding & found a few ideas of songs I'd like to hear in *other* versions, but nothing on this CD sounded like what I wanted to hear at my wedding, let alone anyone else's. If you have limited exposure to classical music, or don't know where to begin in planning your wedding selections, this might be a good place to begin, simply because of the variety. But I wouldn't recommend it as the source of your wedding music."
1,25 Wedding Favorite... Almost,As with many compilation CDs 25WF is long on music but short on musicianship. The performances are dull and lifeless with little or no attention to the subtleties necessary to perform these compositions. The recordings are reminiscent of a Jr. College Orchestra performing late in the day. The sound quality is thin and hollow which adds to the dreary atmosphere.An unremarkable set of recordings to be avoided at all costs.
5,nice buy,"The Price is great, the product is awesome and the quality is excellent! Thank you! Will buy again! Easy Transaction!"
3,Ol' Fletchy Fletch...,"It's Chevy, so you know it's gonna be pretty good.The Fletch movies aren't his best work, but they are good for some laughs.While you won't say either movie is a blockbuster, you won't be disappointed either."
4,Fletch Collection,This is a must have for a Chevy fan. His intelligent style of comedy mixed in with his costumes is great.
4,Its a good start,"Instruction was clear and accurate, but there was too much advertising of the other dance DVDs in the series."
3,Four Jitterbug Steps -- But Two of Them Are Turns,"Like the other Vicki Regan DVDs, they teach ""four"" steps. In this particular dance (which is East Coast Swing -- aka Jitterbug), these are the basic Swing Step that is used for everything [Triple-Step, Triple Step, Rock Step; repeat], the Throwaway -- which is a different hand hold (single) which is needed to set up the two turns that are illustrated. That's it."
5,For anyone who loves old magazines,"This is not as I expected, a collection of vintage covers of old magazines, but a detailed and interesting history of how the avant garde expressed itself and produced original art in the process. It covers the 20th century well up until the zines of the 80s - 90s. It kind of stops there because, says the author, the web takes over. I may not agree with that exactly, but I believe this is a must book for anyone who is passionate about magazine design."
2,The most unbalanced piece of work I've ever seen.,"This anime is basically a SciFi/Comedy/Drama/Magical Girl/Catgirl/Elf Girl/Fantasy/Action serise. It tries way too hard to be like The Vision of Escaflwone and blend in multiple generes at once. I have never seen an anime more confused that this. I can't even explain it. It suddenly goes from serious tragety to horribly mistimed comedy.(try to imagine Jack dieing at the end of Titanic and then suddenly Rose runs accross the water in chibi form screaming and crying with huge crying eyes) It's too funny to take seriously and too serious to be funny, and it's not one of those shows that starts of stupid and gets much better later on like Inuyasha. Seruiously not recomended."
2,Horrible book.,"I've never read something this bad. It dodesn't matter that I'm one of the pple who St. James makes fun of in this book, the fact thaet this book is a piece of kentcky juvenilia written by a collg stuent shoul"
2,The Innocence of Father Brown,This is a dvd that is not a dvd. It is not a video but a book on a dvd. I was disappointed in that thought I was buying a movie rather then a book on dvd.
1,bad bad booleg,i agree with the other review i've been a GG fan since the 70's very poor recording if you want live GG pick up Playing the Fool
5,This album deserves 6 stars,"I stumbled across Cori on MySpace and instantly fell in love with her music. I bought the cd and it plays everywhere. I've got a copy in my car, at work, at home and in my cell phone. I love every single song on the cd. There is not a single bad song to be found. My favorite is probably Shatterproof. Cori seems to have the ability to put feelings, that most people can relate to, into music. I don't understand how in the world someone hasn't offered this young lady a recording deal. She's the real deal. She's got incredible beauty and a voice to match it. Now if only she'd travel outside of Florida so I can see her live."
5,my female singer of 2005!!!!!!!!!!!,"I heard cori first time in december.Than i join myspace and i went often to her site to listen to her amazing voice and music!!!!!She is amazing singer.I am an music expert who ""live"" music since i remember myself.She is so pro thats its amazing!!!!!!!She has the voice , shes amazing live act and above that a great personality that treat her 60000 fans on myspace the best she can.I dont stop to listen to ""ringing in my head "" .(i have one in my car and one at home...i love that cd!)Track 5 ""i want that"" became ny favorites from this cd and its should be an worlwide hit.I love the entire cd , its so good .She became my top female artist. thats for sure!!!!!!Any track on her cd could be an hit single.What a singer!!!!!!!She deserve to be a superstar....Iam an huge Queen fan .Freddie mercury has it!!!!Cori has it as well.....she was born to be a singer ....she was born to rock!!!!!And whats an amazing cd cover!!!!!!!!Do yourself a favour ....get coris cd!!!!!!!"
1,Not Real TV Version of theme song!,"I bought this thinking that it had the ""actual"" TV version theme song. It is not! It is a fine instrumental copy by someone, but definetly NOT what you hear on the TV show. When I saw the words ""theme song-TV version"", I expected to get exactly that. I was very dissapointed that it was not what is actually on the CD. I am now trying a recommeded CD from the 70's-80's telivision theme songs. We'll have to see if that one is what it says it is!"
1,"Yes, I also feel cheated!","I also bought this cd because of the great song from the tv hit series M*A*S*H, not that Suicide is Painless on this album is bad but i wanted the theme without the words! So take my advice don't buy this album!"
1,Mix on Best Song of Album is Anything But Painless,"Except for a rather infuriating problem with the mix of ""Suicide is Painless,"" this is a fine album, which is a little like saying, ""besides that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the show?"" The recorded volume level drops out dramatically about midway in the opening track... jeesh! I bought this album specifically for that one outstanding and memorable song. Everything else on this album sounds satisfactory, but after the major production-value disappointment of Track 1, how can the listener feel anything but cheated?"
5,Listen as Hawkeye and Duke stitch their way through Korea,I thought if the movie was awsome the soundtract would be awsome too. I was right the Mash soundtract is the best soundtract I've ever heard its even better than the Forest Gump soundtract. My suggestion is that you go out and by this wonderful peice of art right away. And belive me you'll be laughing for hours. But you dont have to take my word for it.
3,***1/2 out of *****; an average CD,"Well, it could've been better than this, but the CD version of Johnny Mandel's ""M*A*S*H"" score is still better than the original LP release (which didn't even include the full, un-edited version of ""Suicide is Painless""!). It's an average CD, but nearly all the songs contain audio clips from the film with the music merely as background audio - which I disapprove of. At least they've decided to keep in some un-edited songs like ""Suicide is Painless"" and the Ahmad Jamal version of that song. Good for M*A*S*H fans; for anyone else, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Liked it,This cd was excellent. It gave snipets from the movie and the music that went with it. I throughly enjoyed it.
4,"Like it,but missing 2 things","I like the receiver. I have a HD TIVO Directv box, HD cable box, dvd player, Apple TV and WII hooked up to it.Two things I don't like;a. no audio out on the back for headphonesb. they changed the remote codes, so my TIVO remote can't control the volume. None of the SONY codes on TIVO work.Sigh."
4,Sony STR-DG910,This is a nice product. I made the decision to buy this receiver based on its HDMI switching capabilities. It also has integrated Dolby Digital and DTS features. I used the external microphone to setup the surround system and right away the systems was sounding great! You can even edit the input names to suit your preferences. I changed the SAT/TV display setting to cable for my easy reference.
3,"Nice receiver, but not perfect...","Good: HDMI switching and video conversion make life so much easier! Nice sound quality, plenty of power, lots of configuration options. It's worked perfectly with my Tivo HD, Xbox360, Wii, PS3, and PC input.Bad: Doesn't decode the latest HD formats (DTS Master HD, Dolby True HD). Not a huge deal, but kind of unforgivable at this price. Only 3 HDMI inputs. Automatic speaker calibration made my system sound worse.Verdict: Now that Onkyo has released their TX-SR606, the DG910 is pretty much obsolete. More HDMI inputs, HD format support, and it's only a few bucks more. Sorry Sony. Game over."
5,Awesome receiver,"Especially for the price, this is a fine piece of sound equipment, highly recommended to anyone."
3,Works just fine,I was a little disappointed due to the fact that it dosn't have that much power like I thought
2,Very Week FM receiver. No response from Sony,"A few weeks ago I sent this e-mail to Sony. To-date I have received no responseQuestion #1 I have a background hiss on my PBS FM Radio Station. Why?Background:I replaced a Sony STR D990 with this Sony STR DG 910. I got perfect FM reception with the STR D900. Now I get a subtle but annoying background hiss when trying to listen to WRTI Or the PBS station. A few rock stations come in fine.Question #2I am connected to my 50"" Panasonic Plasama TV via HDMI. Is there any reason to connect your Digital Coaxial to my TV?Thank you for your time and information.PhilEven though it took days and days to figure out the connections and the technical switching instruction, I finally got the unit working. Then when I went to reattach the FM cable (over the air) I now get a hiss indicating a very week FM receiver. What a bad deal! And then, no answer from SONY!!!!"
3,Does not upconvert audio,"Nice receiver...HOWEVER...it will upconvert video signals from a DVD player or Xbox that is hooked up via s-video or component cables (the red, white and yellow cables) and send the video to your tv via the HDMI, but it does not send the audio on the upconverted signal...So, you still need to run an audio cable from older dvd and xboxs to the tv...ruining the idea of only one HDMI cable going to your plasma"
1,Sony rewrites tech vocab...,"It says on the side of the box upconverts component and composite to HDMI. Now, I have never heard of upconverting meaning anything other than the visual improvement of a standard picture to resemble an HD one. Sony Customer Service representatives insists that it means the wire can carry a 1080p signal, not that the signal will be improved. They say the word I want is upscaling and yes I have heard these words used interchangeably. Is there a Dictionary out there? No! then there would have to be standards established for HDMI 1.1, 1.2, 1.3a, 1.3v, 1.3 repeater. What the heck! No upscaling or zone 2."
2,Piece of crap!,"I bought this item almost three years ago. It has steadily had one failure or another. SOund/Picture goes out periodically. I've owned all sony recievers throughout my life. I bought this 7.1 for the blue ray, but it started to fail around 9 months old. If it wasn't for the Sony XBR TV, and Sony Blue Ray, I'd buy a Pioneer or Onkyo. Bad investment!"
4,Sony STR-DG910 7.1 Channel Home Theater Receiver,I'm totally satisfied with this Sony receiver.Be prepared to study the handbook thoroughly as the menus can get a little confusing.Also do yourself a favor and get banana plugs to hook up your speakers.After all is said and done you will be rewarded with a great receiver.JM
5,Just what I was looking for,"I had been looking for months for a receiver that had three or more HDMI outputs and that did not cost a fortune. I had pretty much given up looking, when by pure chance; I came across a review of the Sony STR-DG910 online. If you can get away without having analog components like I can, and don't need every bell and whistle (like being able to output a second source to a different room), this is a great receiver. Setup was simple and it works just as advertised. The only gripe I have, and it echoes other reviews I've read, is that the receiver's speaker hookups are a pain. Not enough of a gripe to reduce my rating, but a gripe none the less."
2,Sakura wars-ugg,"i rate this a two-out-of-five. It's just---so weak! I thought this would be a cute show like with mecha robots, but, yuck, it's just---all over the place! the story-line, well, their isn't one! I have to admit the animation is very crisp, but the voice actors stink, everythings just so wrong. When i rented this from block-bursters, i thought i'd like it, but---nope! a definate 2-out-of-five! (because i like the theme song!)"
2,This is a PSA from a complete stranger,"Friends don't let friends drive drunk. As an added caveat, friends who have friends who are Simian fans won't let them buy this album.To put it bluntly the sonic experimentaion, interesting sound flourishes, twisted-yet-catchy melodies and overall creativity Simian displayed on its debut album is all but absent.The music is cookie cutter, wannabe sunny California crap, and everything about this album is generally offputting. Not even the best songs here capture a fraction of what made the debut so wonderful. Avoid at all costs, unless someone hands it to you walking down the street."
2,Don't be fooled,"I'm not saying this album is bad, but I heard ""La Breeze"" and couldn't get the song out of my head. That song is not representative of the rest of the album AT ALL. I couldn't classify the rest of the album any particular gender, but it sure isn't rock, and it isn't my cup of tea."
2,Simian reverts to ape form ... ack!,"They blew it. Pure and simple as that. If you loved Mr. Crow off their first album and bought that single and played it out, you'll love We Are Your Friends. Otherwise, Simian isn't going to have too many friends. Chemistry Is What We Are worked because of the mixtures: electronic beats, chunky rhythms, and beautiful melodies with harmonized vocals. The first three songs blew you away. Someone said it was like Aphex Twin meets the Beach Boys, and that was as good a description as possible. The music sounded as if they were experimenting and almost making it up as they went along. On this album, every song is unerringly the same: a little distorted bass, jumpy drums, and far too many bad lyrics. They sound like they're trying to get radio play or something, and it just doesn't work. Two songs are least palatable; the opener and the closer, La Breeze and End Of The Day. But simply put, We Are Your Friends consists of Simian going pop, and it hurts to listen."
3,Andy Williams plus 70's Music Schmaltz,"I love Andy Williams' Christmas Album. It's my favorite Christmas album ever, so when I spotted a CD version of ""Christmas Present,"" I jumped all over it. Unfortunately, while Andy's singing is still excellent, the album is troubled in spots by really bad 70's music production: ""wacka wacka"" guitars, heavy-handed basslines, and some hippie-dippie flute solos.The good thing is that it doesn't persist across all the songs--the way it does with Dean Martin's later albums. Many of the songs have nicer baroquish guitars in them. For my money, I prefer the big beautiful band orchestrations of the 50's and 60's Christmas albums. If Amazon offered a half-point rating scale, I'd give this 3.5."
3,Not as sharp this time.,"I've ordered these arrows before and they were great. This last group came with 49 grain nibb points instead of 100 gr combo field points. Also, one of the 6 nocks just popped off after a couple of shots. Poor glue job I guess."
4,Great arrows as always Easton.,"I remember when making or buying arrows was an ordeal, I can cut through all the problems and just order a set to my specifications. Thanks Easton/ Amazon."
1,Points Keep Coming Off,"I will not buy these again...the points keep coming off. Seller made... Beware!!!And, very poor Customer Service by this seller."
4,Where has all the fletching gone?!,"The shafts and points have held up nicely, but the fletching has taken a beating and some is completely gone. Of the 6 arrows, only three remain in shooting condition. Guess I'll have to invest in an arrow repair kit."
5,Arrow for Sports,I realy like the product I just order at Amazon. It has a exelent quality and is wath I was specting to be.
2,Another poor effort by Royster,"When will publishers realize that Royster's books are just plain wierd? This book goes nowhere; after 100 pages of Va. genaologies, anecdotes, and poorly put together themes, the book barely mentions the Swamp and one cannot tell where in the world the author is going. He writes in a pleasing style but his subject is incredibly disjointed. The same was true of his earlier book ""This Destructive War."" I have given up on Royster; he has forgotten that a book has to have a subject and must deal with a subject in an orderly fashion."
1,s/b The Tedious History of Acct Records of 18th century UK,"Here here, ""A reader from Fort Lauderdale, Florida""I bought this book due to my interest in history in the US Southeast, and in new ventures. The cover of this book promised ""an eye-opening account of greed, folly and venture capitalism"".Wrong!This history was meticulously researched, but reads like the many 18th century ledgers that the author no doubt examined. No story, little analysis, and just a brutal read. Somehow I persevered through to the end of this tome, but recommend the reader spend their time elsewhere. I wish I had."
3,Don't seek this out for entertainment's sake....,"Ledgers, lists of names, etc., etc., etc. While this was far from a compelling read, there were bits and pieces that I picked up that thoroughy entertained me. I certainly doubt that the general history reader would find this compelling, but I did enjoy reading about Lord Dunmore's reluctance to come to Virginia and, apparently, disagreeable personality and genuine enjoyment of liquid refreshment.I return to this book now and then for a quick refresher. However, I would not define it as a classic of historical literature."
4,Wonderful varied music yet with the same sensuous undertones,"I bought this CD to add to my collection of Bossa Nova/Jazz/Portuguese and being a fan of Jobim thought ""well at least"" but to my surprise this CD delivers! It was more than expected. One can totally enjoy this alone, with a close friend or group gathering. Yes we have heard some of these arrangements before performed and well known like 'Girl From Ipanema' 'Desafinado' 'Triste' and 'One Note Samba' but they are so well done here and with such smooth sensuous flavor you won't miss what your ear isn't hearing... This week I finally saw the Movie, now I appreciate the CD so much more. The movie maybe low keyed, yes but alot is being said here! Seeing the Movie can only increase your listening pleasure and...ahhh the sights and sounds of...Brasil? Well not only,(just BEFORE 'Medfud' kidding aside) New England is full of the wonderful Portuguese and there also this Movie is filmed. Getting this CD you won't be sorry..."
3,Soundtrack?,"This is a beautiful CD, but I was expecting a soundtrack from one of my favorite films and at least half the songs I anticipated hearing aren't included, which is disappointing. Otherwise the music is fine, but if you are looking for an exact soundtrack, as I was, heads up because what you'll get is exactly what the description says: ""Music from the Motion Picture"" -- but not ALL the music, plus a lot of other stuff, too."
4,"Good, But Missing a Key Song","I'm in agreement that the CD is great - but I knew that from seeing the film. I have to voice the same complaint, where is the outstanding Sarah Vaughan version of ""Wave""? I've gone crazy searching for it. Anyone have any idea where else it can be gotten?"
4,A great intro into the world of Bossa Nova...,This is already one of the staples in my record collection. It is an album where all the artists on the album all perform to their greatest. Not a big track and they all add harmony to your random disc selection.
4,The CD from Ipanema...,This soundtrack sounds great from start to finish. A consistent jazzy/latin/salsa compilation that gets under your skin and makes you feel kinda sexy...
3,Good but...,"Good but was written in 1992. Some of the content is outdated. Used to be a must have because it was the only one. But now with Colloqial Afrikaans, it's not a good buy. I reccommend Colloquial Afrikanns with the tapes."
5,Learn German in college first,"It helps to have strong German instruction prior to purchasing this book. Once a year of German is under the belt, this book will enable you to master Afrikaans in 3 to 4 months, if you read it diligently every night. The pronunciation is difficult to master, as the book attempts to give examples of the many strange vowel combinations found in Afrikaans. The vocabulary, however, is simple and the verb tenses even simpler. I made friends in the Johannesburg area and continue to write in Afrikaans after studying this book. The lessons are relevant and the short stories enable the reader to learn new words quickly. Do NOT study Dutch and think you will be able to get by in Afrikaans, as Dutch has bizarre gender differences and strange verb tenses. This language is easy to learn and fun to practice."
1,wrong price and too old to be useful,"I have this book, but my Afrikaans husband tells me it is ridiculous. Much of the language that is taught is not spoken any longer and would never be used. I have ordered her new book due out in Feb 2005 and have hopes that it will be up to date. Apart from that the price listed is horrendously wrong !"
5,I love my Weber Genesis Silver grill,"I have to say, we have owned this grill for about 5 years now and it is my favorite cooking appliance... The knobs and starter button are still in new condition... This is the main complaint of most grill owners... I keep it covered after use. Clean it diligently, and it is my absolute favorite thing we own..."
3,Roger Sanchez in the mix,"Not as good as I expected. Too loudly, too many vocals, too much useless noise. Actualy I don't recommend you to purchase this cd, because you'll recieve the album full of not actul music at this moment, maybe 2 years ago it was o.k. but now it's time for real housemusic. The only good side of this compilation is MIXING, Sanchez has done it again, it's superb mixed up tracks. For your information: if you like Sanchez, he has released his first own album called ""First contact"""
1,Hardcore P-Funk fans: Avoid this compilation,"I got this CD for only one reason---to get the long version of One Nation Under A Groove on CD finally--the one with the extended Michael Hampton guitar solo that is sorely missing on the original LP/CD. This CD says One Nation is the 12"" version, but it is identical to the regular version on the original release. Also, Oh I is incorrectly titled on this collection, it is in fact Shockwaves. Avoid this junk, just buy the original CDs out already."
3,"NOT BAD, BUT ALSO NOT THAT GOOD","This best part of this book is the picutres. They are spectacular! But the problem is that there is almost no supporting information. The text pretty much consists of a generalized history or synopsis of a ghost town. If you want to see great pictures along with history of the towns, other pertinent informantion, directions or locations, then don't buy this book!! A ghost town book with most of the western states seems like a great idea, but the authors failed. Many great ghost towns are even left out. Why no Ruby, Arizona, Gold Point, Nevada or Silver Reef, Utah? I don't know. It is not even divided into chapters or sections by state or geographic region, just a mix of various pictures throughout the book (but magnificent pictures they are). My recommendation, this is probably not the book you want."
4,asleep at the wheel epic 33097,"I have been searching for this CD version of the 1974 album that we listened to in the barracks of the 382d PSC, at Ft. Devens Ma. in 1974.I have the original album but wanted a CD copy for my IPOD etc.....I have listened to all available Asleep at the Wheel music, but this rare recording is by far the best. It took me 2 years to find it, but AMAZON came through."
4,Great Ideas for Fish,"I have a collection of James McNair's favorite recipes and it is my favorite cookbook. Everything I've ever made from that book has been spectacular. Thinking about that, I decided to branch out and get some more McNair cook books. One of the first ones that I chose was the ""James McNair's Fish Cookbook"". This is a slim hardback volume, but like most of McNair's books, it is filled with beautiful photography in addition to his artful recipes. Some of these recipes are a little more complicated than i want to get with a fillet of fish, and some contain ingredients that I am not sure I will be able to acquire where I live, but on the whole, there are many recipes that I plan to try, and all of them are adaptable and give me some inspiration for what to do with whatever fish may be on sale at the grocery store."
4,Scary!,"Want to be scared? Little Evil Things 4 (one CD, 75 min, original production, Little Evil Things) is a scare a minute. These small pieces of horror on a stick are light enough for the tame of soul and frightening as an adult case of goosebumps. Note to actor Jim McDonnell: Keep scaring the hell outta me. You do it in every evil collection."
3,Decent,"This book is decent if you have not extensively looked at chinese strategy. It lists Zhuge Liang's Essays, however you can find those for free on many websites, as well as inside the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the reason you should get this book is mainly because it offers a lot of history on Liu Ji, which is a LOT harder to find almost anywhere, and that part of it is extremely valuable in my eyes."
3,Not as much insight into Zhuge Liang as I had hoped,"My review is not from the point of view of someone who is a fan of Sun Tzu's Art of War, nor a businessman seeking ancient answers to modern problems of business ""warfare."" I am a psychologist, and a massive fan of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and I consider Zhuge Liang to be one of the greatest men in history. I bought this book hoping to get some insight into the psychology of Kongming but unfortunately found his essays to be quite dry and uninformative, at least for my purposes. However, Liu Ji's commentaries were a pleasant surprise, mostly due to the examples given from different periods of Chines history, including The Three Kingdoms period."
5,"Michele Deco Diamond Watch - Love it, love it, love it",Love this watch. Received it within 24 hours of ordering and didn't pay extra for that........brought it to a jewelry store that sells Michele watches to have the watch band sized. Great transaction :}
5,Beautiful Watch!!!!,Beautiful watch! So happy it's 500.00 less than the price in Bloomingdales! So worth the price!
2,Too few pieces,"They only came with four long connectors, the short connectors are pretty much useless. The Magnetix stuff is neat, but to get enough pieces to build something interesting will force you to remortgage the house. If you insist on buying these, buy a few sets."
5,superb european free improv,"This is another in the Unheard Music series put together by John Corbett on Atavistic Records. I believe this is the earliest recording by our heroes currently available. Usually recording as the Schlippenbach Trio (with Parker and Lovens), here they are joined by Peter Kowald on bass. Awesome stuff! Recent recordings are still great (""Complete Combustion"" is the latest, on FMP, and check out ""50th Birthday Concert"" under Parker's name, with 1 disc of Schlippenbach/Parker/Lovens and 1 of Parker/Guy/Lytton), but here you have a greater sense of adventure as these young rebels explored the possibilities of playing FREE. Four long tracks that are absolutely exhilarating!"
1,At least it only cost $2.00,"I had never heard of this author before I bought (the audio version of) Visits from the Drowned Girl. I bought it only because it was cheap and I spend a lot of time listening to books on my long drive to work. The book had moments that captivated me, mostly through honest and charming sentences that seem not to belong in a story filled with unlikeable characters and tedious side tracks into information that adds nothing to the story.I liken it to a conversation with an elderly relative who can take his sweet time telling a story that is, in turn, compelling, disgusting, long-winded and amusing. Because he knows his audience is forced by politeness to see the story to the finish, he embellishes to make it last, but in the end, neither party has gained anything from the exchange.I must admit I was never good with old people, and have yet to finish listening to this tale. From reading the reviews, it doesn't sound promising, but I'll see it through on my next drive to work."
1,Pure Crap,"This was the worst book I have ever read - completely tasteless and boring. In fact, I think the author even got bored writing in the end. Do not even waste your time reading this book. It is a complete waste of time. There is nothing to be learned or gained, not even any enjoyment whatsoever from reading the book. Pointless subplots having nothing to do with anything, a main character who does not learn anything in the end but spends a lot of time jerking off and getting away with raping a midget, and a ""white-trash"" setting and cast of characters that are only included in the story to give the book ""character"" is not good literature. I am so disgusted by how much crap gets published that I am writing a letter of protest to Random House. It's about time attention is spent in publishing quality literature."
1,No Stars,"I am sad to say I would give this book no stars if possible. True, the writing is fine enough; but, paradoxically, this is one of the most disappointing things about the book. Mr. Sherrill has talent as a writer, but his sensibility here is off to the extent that is seems a waste of talent to have written this book. Visits relies on shock value and grotesqueness for its momentum. These are stock items, not creativity. There are parts of the book that I sincerely believe are plainly misogynistic. Writing talent is only half the necessary package; the other half is sensibility. This story has few, if any, redeeming qualities. Mr. Sherrill should have written it and tucked it away, then moved on to subject matter that interests and entertains the reader--and perhaps adds some insight to human nature and to our plights as human beings. All this book does is wallow in stereotypes of ""white trash"" culture--if you can call what Sherrill displays here ""culture."""
1,disappointing,"It's hard to believe that the same mind that produced the intelligent, moving, and fantastic Minotour Takes a Cigarette Break, wrote Drowned Girl. Visits From A Drowned Girl is indeed a dark book, which I usually like. Fortunately, Sherrill's writing ability showed moments of the magic from his previous book, to keep me reading this one. But I was left feeling empty... what was the point of the darkness? No overall message seemed to eek out... or justify some of the really awful things the main character did. The characters seemed a bit contrived, the dialogue and plot (and subplots) forced and disconnected. Really, a big disappointment. If you are interested in this author (even if you're not) definately read his first novel, skip this one, and hope for better in the future."
5,Classic!,"A perfect blend of Old World orchestra, bittersweet piano, haunting harpsichord, fun dolly hijinx, with the occasional rock guitar."
1,don't risk it,"i bought this case for my brand new white macbook and came across some comments online saying that it leaves black marks on laptops. so i emailed incase asking them about this problem and this is what they wrote:""You can certainly have the sleeve replaced should any discoloration occur to your laptop we will replace the case. We've had a few instances of the staining occurring on the new white macBook finish but it's easily cleaned off with an eraser. Any eraser will work but the soft tan colored types work best and leave very little residue.""thanks, but i'd rather not spend 40 bucks to have ""very little residue"" left on my laptop when i could get a cheaper sleeve that will actually do its job and PROTECT my laptop. i'm not taking the chance. i'm returning it."
1,My laptop screen got smashed and destroyed whilst in this case,"Not much more that I can say about this product. I bought it, used it to put my laptop in luggage, and when I got my back back the laptop screen was shattered and the computer no longer works. Clearly the product is worthless."
3,Four ingredients = 200+ recipes!,Easy and quick recipes for newly diagnosed diabetics or anyone wishing to monitor their carbohydrate and fat intake. Useful food exchange and serving size information for each item.
3,Book condition not as expected.,"I like the used cookbook overall (as far as the recipe quality); but,someone had written notes on several individual recipes in a bold pen that bled through onto the recipe on the back. I am visually-impaired; so, this is extremely irritating. I don't remember the listed condition; but, I believe it was supposed to be ""like new."" I've ordered a number of used ""like new"" cookbooks and this one was the first problem."
4,A must have for your kitchen,"I love ALL of Joie Warner's cookbooks, especially her pasta books. The recipes are simple, quick, and they all taste great. Seriously, ever single one. We keep a lot of the ingredients in our pantry now and can whip up many of her recipes anytime. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because I think she tends to not use enough of the amounts of the ingredients. We often double or triple. For instance, her clam sauce is GREAT and easy, but we use twice as much clam juice, and for all recipes we use way more garlic, etc. No big thing. Easy to do. Seriously, your kitchen needs Joie's pasta cookbooks.She's got Pasta Sauces, Pasta Sauces 2 , and No Cook Pasta. We use ALL of them."
4,Good Buy,It's a good product and a very good buy. Sure beats purching cots at a drug store where the price is extremely high by comparison.
5,great buy!,"I work at a lab making glasses and a lot of what we do can really hurt your fingers! So in combination with finger tape and these finger cots I can very easily protect my fingers. I've ordered these twice and only ever had a few defective cots (had small holes or tears) but its perfectly fine with me since you get 144! If I went to the local super store Id still be paying 3 dollars for 30. Definitely worth the cost for me. It does say on the box not for medical use though, but I'm not using them for that. I would recommend these to anyone needing finger cots! Oh, and to help with picking the right size for your fingers, I wear a size 9 ring on my ring finger and a medium fits that and I wear a large size for my thumb. :)"
2,Cheaply made product,"This product is cheaply made and much too thin, and I will not purchase this brand of finger cots again. If it weren't too much trouble, I would return the unopened boxes. Next time I will go back to buying the Grafco or Triton brands.Judith Charlick"
3,Finger cots,"The medium runs small. If you normally wear a medium, order large. Your circulation will thank you."
1,Useless,"Not only is this bowl ugly (and it is most assuredly that--it looks like a rococo hubcap), it's also heavy (5+ pounds), and honestly, I can't imagine a situation where it would EVER be useful. When do you need a shallow bowl that you can put in both the freezer and the oven? Oh, never. Right.Not only is it hideous, but you have to hand-wash it (according to the instructions attached), and the little dips and scallops in the design mean that it's going to be awesome at trapping food! Have fun!Just garbage. I can't believe anyone designed this."
4,Great for writing in,This is a pretty good book. If you have graduated high school you will be able to zoom up to chapter 3.The only down side about this book is that some of the more complicated procedures in chapter 4 are only demonstrated with one example. This is really annoying if you are trying to teach yourself.
5,Good fan but loud,I bought this fan to replace the old fan in my Dell PC power supply. The other reviews were right: the fan is LOUD. However the fan also moves more air compared to the one it replaced in my PC power supply. The fan evacuates so much air from the PC enclosure that the other thermostatically controlled enclosure fan has yet to turn on! The second fan used to come on and off all the time to keep the computer enclosure temperature down.The fan was packaged in just a yellow bubble mailer. At first I thought this packaging was a bit basic but I actually like that there was no additional unnecessary retail packaging which would have gone straight in the recycling.
2,"OK Book, poor quality binding","The book covers many subjects broadly, from Remote Sensing, LIDAR as well as scanning historial maps. However, I found myself using the online users manual for the basics and step by step detail on HOW to use GRASS.In addition, the binding of the book broke within 6 months, and about 25 pages fell out of the spine, with average use."
3,"Works, but what about the lead!","Well, this Belson Gold-N-Hot is good and hot for straightening coarse hair. Like the hot combs of old that was heated by being held over a flame, you will easily burn your scalp and everything else in contact with this product if you're not careful. I would give this comb a full five stars, if it wasn't for the fact that it wasn't stated in the ad that the electric cord contains lead. In fact, there is a tag attached to the comb warning that the power cord contains lead and that you should wash your hands after handling it!!! I wouldn't have bought the comb if I had known that."
4,I LOVED this camera,I had gotten this camera for a christmas present from my dad loved it takes great pictures and the battery ran out fast for me but i went away on a trip and forgot the camera at home my brother uses it and plugs it into the computer and now its broken. GREAT camera a lot of money to fix if not under warranty but excellent camera LOVED it wen i was bale to use it
3,"Well, it was great for2 years...","Worked great for two years, for vacation and fun photos, and for my web page and printed business pieces.Broke yesterday while in the middle of shooting. Same problem other reviewers are having with the lens buzzing...seems to be stuck.Sony quoted repairs ($185.11 on 3/14/05) are more than the cost of the camera. I may be able to get it fixed locally for $48.60 evaluation fee, plus the cost of the actual repair, or they may have to send it to Sony too!Well, at least I had it 2 years! Can anyone recommend a more reliable brand?"
3,"Good features, easy to use, very poor reliability-support","I have owned this camera for less than a year. I have actually really enjoyed owning it. Very easy to use, nice features. I have always been impressed with the pictures. About 5 days ago my wife turned it on and it started making a loud clicking noise and flashing an error code. I did a little google search and it turns out that quite a few people have had mechanical failures with this model and it has to be sent back for repair. Well, if you are outside the 90 day warranty period you are responsible for labor, and Sony charges at a flat rate of $140 for anything...hmm. Almost the cost of a new camera. This is simply outrageous. Highway robbery. I am having serious thoughts about just ditching the camera and going non-Sony because of this experience.Read around at some of the problems people have had with this camera before buying - and Sony's unwillingness to take responsibility for it. That is my advise."
1,Sony DSCP52 Cyber-shot 3.2MP Digital Camera w/ 2x Optical Zo,"Had this item for less than one year, used it only seldom with great care...it broke and Sony wants $175 to fix it. NEVER buy a sony"
1,CAMERA BROKE - Piece of JUNK,Camera broke after having it for only a few months. The lens cover is stuck half open and half closed. When I turn it on or off it just vibrates and returns to that half & half position. I haven't even used it a dozen times. Called Sony to have it fixed and they said that it would cost over $100 just to look at it....I will never buy another Sony again. Very disappointed.
2,2 year lifespan,"Based on my experience and the experience of others on this forum, it seems this camera has a two year lifespan. My shutter stopped functioning just one month shy of having the camera for two years. Considering it was a $280 investment and I shot only 1496 pictures with it, I am disappointed. I may not buy a Sony again, and will purchase an extended warranty with my next camera."
1,Not the best camera...,"THIS IS THE WORST CAMERA I'VE EVER SEEN.BAD-1. Camera design is not so comfortable. When you grip the camera, if feels like it might slip out becuase of the unbalanced weight (lens is on one side)2. Pictures are HAZY. I mean that. They're not the best quality. I would say that if you are into photography, this is not the camera you want to buy (I know this sounds weird).3. LCD does not come with a plastic cover. IT IS SO EASY TO SCRACH IT. I already have 3 or four big scratches, and maybe it's because the LCD monitor didn't come with a thin plastic cover??? I was really disappointed at Sony, for not taking the time to put a dumb cover on it.4. HARDLY ANY ZOOM. There's at least 2x.. but it's not going to get you too far. Maybe about 2 yards at the most. This camera also has a feature where you can zoom up to 7x. BUT- this feature is TERRIBLE.OVERALL, THIS IS AN EXTREMELY HAZY AND HAS SOME BAD QUALITY PICTUERS.THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER CHOICES OUT THERE. MAKE A GOOD CHOICE."
1,Good pictures-bad warranty,Camera broke five months after purchase. Warranty lasted for three months.
2,"Last yr's lens, this yr's electronics.","As you would expect from a Sony camera, it has good picture quality in daylight. The night shots are not so good since it has only a 2 sec twilight mode. And the lens isn't very bright either. (P72/P32 have brighter F2.8 lens)Battery life is excellent and LCD screen is good. World charger and NiMH batteries are included.Check out the specs of this model carefully, its different from P72/P32. This one is 2in thick, has old & slow 2x zoom lens and is bulky.Its a shame Sony tries to sell 3MP/2x instead of popular combination of 2MP/3x. Not to mention the extra cost of propreitary memory sticks compared to CF/SD cards. There are so many better camera's in market than this for a lower cost, I don't see any reason for this to sell."
3,my 2 years are up - it does not work properly now,"I have had this model for almost 2 years and I have just upgraded to the D-7 (which I am yet to use). This camera has gone 10000 pics and kinda gave up. It no longer uploads pics in order and you have to search thru the tiny images on the screen to see what you just took.The quality of the pics is now sub-par. I took the pics for my friend's daughter's birthday party and almost all were blurry. The flash does not work properly anymore either. Mostly I just need more than 3mp to take decent pics.CONS:* The flash is too far from the lens and casts a large shadow behind the object* the ends of the camera are curved - good luck taking vertical timer pics, it tips over!*it is clunky and oddly-shapedPROS:* It does take a good movie, in two sizes (10 seconds in high setting is the max for my email capabilities)* The memory stick plugs into my Sony TV so I can view, edit, and play movies on my TV. Obviously only a 'pro' if you have a sony tv!"
4,If Only,"If only this camera had a larger zoom range! This is what I keep asking myself time after time. I love the picture quality of the camera, and the fact that you can switch the mega-pixel range from under 1 mega-pixel to 3.2 mega-pixels comes in very handy indeed. I purchased this camera because of the size, just small enough to carry around wherever I go and yet, large enough so that my fat fingers have space to get to all the buttons.I highly recommend this little gem! So, why only four stars, well, I would have liked a larger zoom and IMO EVERYONE has room for improvement.Ciao!"
3,Just OK,"With the exception of the remote shutter control, this collection of accesories really doesn't add any unique functionality. You can buy the battery almost anywhere, the case is nice but unexceptional, and the tripod won't fit into the camera case -- a logical place to carry it.Of the three pieces (I won't comment on the battery since it's just a Duracell CR123 that you can buy anywhere), I use the case the most, the remote shutter release occasionally, and I've never used the tripod. I have a feeling your mileage won't vary. :-)"
1,Upset,I am very upset that this disc is edited. I do not see that bit of information anywhere within the description.
4,The White Man is Back,I Got this Disc yesterday being a Everlast fan sense the first house of pain tape. and its good but I usually need to listen to a disc a few times before I really like it. my first thought was its not as good as whitey Ford....but like I said you might need to give it a little more time......I really like the Slick Rick cover I think that song was made for Everlast.
4,a bit short,"Good songs (i.e., music and lyrics), but be prepared for the fact that the album is a scant 46 or so minutes long. In this day and age, with the ability to put a full 70-74 minutes on a cd, it is hard to choke down the full price when other artisits are filling their cd's for the same money."
3,"Im ""....at whitey's"" but the food not so good this time!!","Let me start off by saying im a HUGE EVERLAST fan so this album disapointed me....just a little. After hearing his near perfect creation that is ""whitey ford sings the blues"" i was dying for more. What i loved about "".....sings the blues"" was that it had an even balance of rap tracks and str8 up guitar songs. Unfortunately this time its more than 80% guitar and only 20% rap. Dont get me wrong, the songs are mostly top quality, but some of them i felt were mediocre at best such as ""put your lights on"", ""mercy on my soul"", ""love for real"" and ""children's story"" (which i never liked anyway). BUT the thing is, when he gets it right, EVERLAST gets it really right!!!! The best on the album are ""whitey"", ""i cant move"", ""black coffee"", ""babylon feeling"" and ""one,two"". The others i didnt mention are solid efforts but not standouts."
5,4.5,"This is the first everlast album apart from the house of pain i have bought. I gotta admit that the blues does work for whitey , even though it was a disapoint to see not many rap songs .Deadly assasins and whitey being the only ones and maybe childrens story. It makes me miss the house of pain period more , everlast should consider doing more hip hop.We saw everlast bite back at eminem - but apart from that, whitey's next album needs mo hip hop . I think he should consider doing an album like skull and bones like cypress hill.The top 5 songs though.1.black jesus2.deadly assasins3.babylon feeling4.cant move5.put ya light on."
5,Best Ever,This cd is alot better than Whitey Ford Sings the Blues. That cd was good but this one blows it away. It starts off with Whitey rapping to the song Whitey. Then goes in to the song Black Jesus witch is the best song on the cd. He talks about life and its hardships and does it very well. It is acoustic rap mixed with a little of the blues and is awesome. He also has big artists like Santana and B-Real on the album to. I greatly recomend this album to everyone. It is amazing.
2,Everlast Isn't like Wine...,Now do not get me wrong; I am a huge Everlast fan. This album is not that good. It has all these guest singers...WHY! I want to hera Everlast. The man does not need all these people taking up space on this album. He did it when he was with HOP..featuring him..or featuring this group..JUST STOP. I bought the CD to hear YOU. Also I went to see him twice in concert; once at a small venue and he was great. Then at the Sony E center and he went on an hour earlier and honestly played 20-25 minutes...I was so angry. If I went to the bathroom I woulda missed him. Also this Cd does a cover of a Slick Rick song...WHY? If you are rock a billy...then so be it.. do us all a favor and reunite HOP.
1,Junk by the CD full! Mind Darkening.,"This is garbage. Everlast is filthy, vile, anti-everything good, and of no worth to the human mind other than to dilute, discourage, cloud, and otherwise weed out any remaing positive feelings and thoughts one may have. How's that for freedom of speech? It's the truth! Not worth the disk it was recorded on. Be careful of what occupies your thoughts.... music is very influential. This influence cannot lead to anything good."
5,Continuing to EVERlast,"Everlast's third album is his best yet. I'm usually pretty wary about buying new CD's that I haven't heard singles from, but I knew Everlast wouldn't let me down. Singles like ""Black Jesus"", ""Deadly Assassins"" (feat. B-Real) are solid tracks and a great follow-up to ""Whitey Ford Sings the Blues"". Now, if only House of Pain would get back together...life would be complete!"
2,Entertaining Fluff,"Noir: Vol. 3 - The Firing Chamber contains three episodes of the series about two female assassins, Mirielle and Kirika, known as ""Noir."" Noir has an international reputation that sends chills down the spine of the most hardened and wicked men.In this volume, we finally meet the mysterious girl who has been lurking in the shadows of the previous two volumes. Her name is Chloe, and she calls herself ""the true Noir."" Who is the true Noir?This DVD is a good way to while away an hour or so, but there are much better anime series out there. Noir is eye candy with little substance. I am tired of the ruthless women knocking off old men, young men, leaving children and pets orphaned. I cannot believe that fluff like this lasts for seven volumes, the same as the magnificent Escaflowne.One bonus on this DVD is an interview with the Japanese voice actress who plays Kirika. The interview is very good."
2,below average quality,"some of these tasted really nasty and some of them were stale, which could be blamed on the poor packaging (flimsy blue cover and very thin plastic cover) that did not survive shipping. but the brown ones you can see in the picture and the really thin ones (which there are a significant number of) you need to skip"
2,Need Hulling Machine,"This is entirely my fault, not realizing how hard these would be to crack. They taste good, but I now know I should have ordered the shelled ones. I ordered 12 containers, some for gifts, but the majority of the containers were broken open, not very presentable. If I had a hulling machine, I would have given a better rating."
3,"Not for pets, for humans only","The description and label says this is unsalted pumpkin seeds, yet it does not say if it's roasted or unroasted. I assumed it's not roasted and purchased it for my degus. Unfortunately, the seeds are roasted and can't be fed to degus. Otherwise the seeds are good for human consumption. But it is essential to provide ALL, not only some of the most important information in merchandise descriptions and on labels. Too bad in many cases this necessity is being neglected."
5,Excellent book for current or aspiring administrators!,"I wish I read this 10 years ago. I would have had much more clarity on my professional landscape. It synthensizes many things I had to experience to understand, see through the BS and smokescreens, bring clarity to career advancement and ways to simply refocus on students."
5,Down to Earth Advice on School Administration,"The authors pull no punches when describing the life of a school administrator. I bought this book back in 1986 when it came out and after a two decade plus career as a principal and superintendent, the truths that the authors offer still ring true. This is a book that I recommend to all of my graduate students who are taking classes to become principals."
1,Wouldn't know,"I don't know about the book because it never came. Also, several others in my class didn't receive their book they ordered from Amazon, so check the availablilty before you buy!"
4,"Great CD for kids, enjoyable even for adults","The only CD for my 4-year-old that I can listen to more than a few times. Nice tunes in all kinds of styles from Beach Boys to hip hop to techno. Good eco-friendly lyrics to teach about nature, as well."
5,Excellent choice for elementary science instruction.,"Teachers will love this CD (or anything by the Banana Slug String Band). The songs are terrific for science instruction, particularly in environmental studies, habitats, animals, and adaptation. Friendly melodies, great lyrics. My students love these songs."
3,Good...not great.,"I love the idea of a female fronted Industrial rock band. Android Lust serve as one of the verry few bands to even attempt such a thing and for that I give them cred. As for this album...""This Body"", and ""Dragonfly"" are really the only songs that I am really excited about. I felt that this album was just a little too slow for my tastes...and many of the songs took too long to build up and climax...hey...kinda like a girl! Heah. Anyways, if your looking for the female version of Nine Inch Nails than look no further. Sadley, Android Lust needs a little more work."
3,Not traditional Hawaiian music...,"This album is ok, but I think it's more Jimmy Buffet style than the traditional Hawaiian slack key that I expected. I guess I should have known by the lack of any Hawaiian language in the song titles. If you are looking for nice ""tropical theme"" background music this will do."
5,Music Appreciation,The item came quickly and was well packaged. I am part of the old school so the Merengue style of music is what I most appreciate in tradtional latin dance. The music is crystal clear and the songs are both respectful to the listener and provides an excellent vibe. Almost every song will put the listener in the mood to dance. It also sounds great in the auto while driving. I am pleased to recomend this C.D. from a great band.
3,Too much of an anthology not enough from the original.,"Starts incredibly with the first two tracks but the Sudden Impact and Magnum Force themes are in my opinion not even from the films....I'm sure they are just cover versions and not very good either. There are a couple of other good tracks, Palancio standing out but this is really just a cop out, pardon the pun. I'm sure they have omitted some of the funkier stuff from the first two films and why I ask. Some of it sounds terribly eighties and yes that is a critisism. I don't think the publishers understand their targetted audience. We are still waiting for the definitive Dirty Harry album."
1,Trish,I bought this for my grandson who never played with this. I can see why- it wasn't fun. This is my only disappointment in ordering from Amazon.
1,Disappointed,"Our daughter bought this coffee maker. We had trouble with it from the start. It leaked water from the base and made a huge mess wherever we put it. She was so disappointed, and so were we."
4,No Need to Add Liquid for Sound Effects!,"My daughter was only 2 when we purchased this toy, so we didn't want to mess with letting her put liquids in it (it doesn't come with pretend ""coffee"" already trapped inside). We did, however, want a coffee pot that made noise. I wasn't sure if the sound effects only worked when there was liquid inside it, but they do! It makes a gurgling/brewing sound when you push the buttons--very cute. We've had this toy for a year without any issues--still works great! It looks really cute sitting on the counter of her pretend kitchen. My husband and I have been served many cups of ""coffee"" from it! Well worth $20. The company that makes it sells it for much more!If you want a great set of dishes that matches this (bold primary colors), search for ""Learning Resources Kitchen Set"". Those are great too."
1,Great Toy made like garbage,"I am on my second coffe maker. The toy is designed to put water into it, however the battery compartment on the bottom does not have a gasket and does not stop water from getting in. Guess what - a 4 yr old putting water in a toy MIGHT spill some and it MIGHT get into where the batteries are on the bottom of the unit. They kids love it, but after a few uses it stops everytime. Too bad - its a cute toy, but it stops pumping water in a month or two. Don't buy this toy."
1,Was awesome until in broke,"This was one of the best toys my two kids had in their play kitchen area--however it broke after 6 months and it was NOT misused. I just called the company and it only had a 90 day warranty. It should have lasted a lot longer. I'm very, but not as dispappointed as my 3 and 4 year olds b/c I am not buying a replacement. If you want to buy it as a disposable toy then great- otherwise don't waste your money."
1,Leaks all over the place - don't buy this one,"My daughter wanted this coffee maker so badly. We have the matching blender and were pleased with it, so I went ahead and bought the coffee maker for her birthday. Big mistake. It leaks water out the base and onto the counter, creating a huge mess. I returned it for a replacement (which was done quite quickly) only to have the exact same thing happen with the second one. Don't waste your money and time on this product!"
2,false advertisement,We were very disappointed and felt the pictures were misleading on this coffee maker. Who in their right mind would let a child play with real coffee? It appears that the coffee pot has real coffee in it (that would not spill out) and there is actually nothing in it and recommended you put water in it. I chose this pot specifically because I thought it was realistic looking and had pretend coffee in it.The only thing that it does that we like is make sounds like a real coffee pot.
5,Toy Coffee Maker,I bought this toy for a playroom for my grandchildren. They love putting water in it and pretending there is real coffee that is made. It is a fun toy.
5,Coffee anyone!?,"My 4 yr old daughter loves this coffee maker. She can pour the water in and watch it come out and then serve coffee! The picture is a little deceiving because the ""coffee"" is brown in the picture....must be for a visual description because here in the USA, our water is clear....not brown. She is having alot of fun with the coffee maker."
4,hours of fun,"We had this toy for 1 year before it broke & we MORE than got our money's worth... it's an awesome toy that provided hours of fun, imaginative play. We would set it up on the bathroom counter on top of a hand towel (along w/ educational insights blender & mixer), run a basin of water, & my 4-yr-old & 2-yr-old would pour water for an hour at a time. They would use a plastic tea set with it. Was so disappointed when the pump quit working, but it was such fun I'm considering replacing it."
4,Coffee's On,"These small appliances have been lots of fun. While the mixer has been the gadget to occupy my grandson's time the most, because of those beaters going round and round. This coffee maker is a good second place because of how it actually processes the water and it is fun to pour the liquid into cups."
3,"it is fun for kids, pain in the butt for mom","My son loves this toy, but it is kind of messy. I did know this before buying it cause I did read the reviews. I keep it in the kitchen so when he plays with it I put it on a tray and use a towel."
5,as described,"These reviews are becoming a pain. The product is fine, the review process sucks with the minimum requirement of 18 words being demanded."
4,Fascinating commentary on what nicotine can do.,"Dr. Brigham's coverage of the impact of nicotine on the human body is thorough and interesting. She is an engaging writer and has interweaved a captivating account of a typical smoker. This book very much like Carson's ""Silent Spring"" for the smoking world."
2,Very Technical and Statistical - not Heartfelt,"I read the first half of this book, and was dying to stop reading. It was scientific and statistical, but I could not use that to quit. What I really needed, was Chapter 1 - OK here's an overview of how to quit . . . clear details to follow in subesequent chapters."
1,the rendering,I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE THE DVD BUT IT WAS DEFECTED AND MY SELLER WOULD DO NOTHING ABOUT IT...............
3,A great tool!,"I am a student at a seminary in the metroplex and was required to purchase this book for a class. I have found that this book is a wonderful tool to enhance the insight that can be taken from the Old Testament Prophets.The author takes you through every Old Testament prophet and gives a summary that will add color and depth to your reading. It will provide history, context, background, etc. It has been a book that I have recommended to others to better understand the power behind Old Testament writings."
5,An excellent tool for understanding the prophets.,"Simply the best commentary on the prophets out there! Dr. Smith's dating of the prophets and interpretation of their messages shows careful, thoughtful, exegesis of the text and his presentation in writing is easy to follow. Any person can use this book for a study of the prophets and benefit greatly from it. Pastors - this one is a must-have for your library. When was the last time you preached a series on one or more of the prophets? Was it because you do not fully understand the messages they have? This book should kindle the desire to preach the prophets!"
3,Old school rock pounder.,"There is a lot of hand grinding that goes into making the E3-22P. The machining is uneven and lacks symmetry. Eastwing does not even try to finish the bottom of the head. The casting marks are uneven, prominent, and painted grey. Finally the blue material on one side of the handle is higher than it is on the other.I have had a Eastwing E3-14R rock pick for over 35 years and it has lasted very well. It was only slightly better made than my new E3-22P. The tool is good enough to pound rocks."
5,Good rock pick,"I think it lives up to the eastwing brand name. It is a good tool, solid, hardy, does the job. It has a stell shaft and that does mean it is heavy to carry far. Most of my rocking doesn't involve long hikes anymore so the extra weight is fine for me."
4,will rust,"This hammer is coated with a clear material that keeps it shining, but this will chip off the first time you use it and the exposed metal will rust quickly. I got mine engraved and it rusted that day.Otherwise, the right weight to swing at a soft rock. Not heavy enough for hard crystalline rocks. The right sheath, the rubber Estwing one, is impossible to find and not made anymore."
5,A Quality Product,This product was purchased over other similar items because of the reputed quality and testimonials of other reviewers. This rock pick/hammer has the quality look and feel that tells you it is top notch all the way. Just started using this tool recently in my newfound hobbie ...metal detecting/prospecting. It has great balance and solid weight to get the job done. I am glad I went with the heavier 22-ounce pick. I couldn't be happier with my purchase and expect to get a lifetime of use from this fine product.
5,Geologists Favorite Hammer,So far I really like this hammer. Totally worth the money. It's to carry and very easy to break off hand samples with. :D
4,Hamme rok but package was damaged,"The hammer is ok and beautiful btw,but the package was damaged,so i suggest to change the packaging system.Thanks!"
5,If you're on the fence about 14 vs 22 like me. . .,"I am a first year geology student and our professor recommended Estwing hammers. I figured the investment would be worth it since I'll probably be using this bad boy for a while. A little about myself, I'm a 21-year-old female and I'm not quite muscular. I was on the fence about buying this size as opposed to the smaller 14 oz size. I figured the 14 would be easier for me to tote around all day and whatnot. But a friend showed me her 22 and it didn't appear to be all that bad. So, I made this purchase. I've already used it on a Paleontology field trip and busted up rocks for several hours straight with no problem. I definitely suggest wearing eye protection though, as the pick itself states. You never know what could happen! If you're on the fence as I was about purchasing the 22 vs the 14, I'd suggest just getting the extra weight as it helps pack a punch. All in all, I'm happy with my first rock hammer purchase. :)"
3,Dark Filming,"I wish I could give this a better rating but on the second session the filming is so dark in places; you can't see what she's doing. For me personally; the instructors voice was irritating, not soothing."
4,One song and a remake...,"Im a fan of this band. They deliver the goods if you're into ""fantasy-metal"" If you dont care much about wizards, demons, and so on stay away. If you like massive symphonic metal with big choirs you're right on the spot here. The fact that this single is almost impossible to find makes it worth craving for. The remake of ""land of immortals"" is to me worth it all and the ""were dragons fly"" adds to the nessessities to own this one...."
5,Best self-help book,"I've read quite a few self-help books over the years but none helped me with my thinking the way this one did. I wish I had gotten this book years ago it would have saved me a lot of angst. It wasn't written recently, but it is a classic I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about looking honestly at themselves and are willing to change their thinking."
4,self help through stories,This book is a self help book that helps the reader by going through various scenarios and cognitive therapy. It gives you the right way of doing things and the wrong way (it's very black and white). Check it out sometime.
5,song of albion,Bought the book for my mom and husband and I have not read the book yet. They enjoyed the book though.
3,good ... not great,"Most of the book gave insight to Celtic, my Celtic, heritage. Perhaps the mystical appearances of monsters and demons is part of that but I could have done without it. Good enough, however, to read the whole series. I would qualify my recommendation to others."
4,Good but short of rest of series,This was well written piece of christian fantasy. Overall I give this a 4 because it did not stand up to the rest of the series. Parts of the story felt contrived and made no sense. Other parts made were the same engaging and engrossing read in the first two books. At times it felt drawn out but at other points it felt as if the author was trying to rush through the story where a little more detail was needed. I myself loved the ending but I expected it to be an allegory to the sacrifice of Christ and so expected it. I noticed a lot of reviewers blasted this aspect of the book. Lawhead has always been a christian writer and never hid his beliefs in any of his books so it should have been expected. All in all a great classic.
5,Thanks!,Shipped promptly...just as said. Was sent as a gift to the inmates of Vigo County Jail because it was requested and they are seriously lacking in their literature selections since they have done away with the library program.
3,Super Reader,"A solid fantasy trilogy, with the often useful hook of placing a modern man into the setting - with the twist that he becomes one of the great Celtic heroes, but not quite how you expect. The other thing is that he is an arts grad student nerd, too, so even more surprising. Not remarkable though, certainly would not read it again. Everything ends mostly happily."
2,Brutal Ending,"I previously read Lawhead's King Raven trilogy, and once again, the author fails to deliver a good ending to one of his exhausting trilogies. There was decent build up in this book, but the ending was so quick and so anti-climactic, that it just felt empty. Then he goes and tacks on the insufferable Jesus crap and completely ruins the whole series. I'm done with Lawhead."
4,"Liked it, but...","I really enjoyed the entire Song of Albion, but Lawhead occasionally drags his stories on a bit too long trying to create a mood. All the action of The Endless Knot takes place in the first hundred and last twenty pages or so. However, Lawhead IS an excellent writer, and able to draw the reader into his alternate universe. I just could have done with less tramping through the Forbidden Land."
2,Just ok,"Im pretty forgiving of fantasy, since I read so much there is just not enough out there for me to be too big of a snob. But I just dont really get what people see in this. It just felt flat to me. There was no three dimensional characters that I really believed in. I was never transported by good writing to the stage where you forget they are not real. I always felt like I was reading a book, and a cliche one at that. There was nothing at all unique or memorable about it. The ""bad guy"" (simon) is just a bad selfish guy- no complexity or understanding as to what really motivates it. The relationship with Llew and his wife seemed kinda wooden- just not great. The writing itself is not terrible but the character and plot developement was just not great. Read only if you are hard up for a new book :)"
4,Great Read!,Love the series! I stumbled upon the first book at work and after reading it there bought the entire series!
2,Skips through important concepts too quickly,"I am using this book in 2 courses - Signals & Random Processes, and Digital Transmission. Although the material is very in-depth, unless you already know the material and just need a refresher, you will probably find out that it's very hard to follow what the authors say. If I was relying on this book alone, I wouldn't have understood a thing.They jump from one major topic to another on the same page without explaining the concepts in depth. There are very few examples to help you understand the concepts.If you have the choice, I would recommend against this book and would recommend John Wiley's Introduction to Analog & Digital Communications, or a book with the same title by Michael Fitz."
3,Required but not a particularly good text.,This just turned out to not be a particularly good text. It's seems garbled and minimal attention is paid to examples and clarity of working out the concepts. It's odd because I have a different Proakis book for DSP that is much better.
3,The only good thing about Cyberchase is Gilbert Gottfried,"I do not like Cyberchase. I think the show is boring and the website is great. I do like some games on the website like Cyber pattern player,(patterns) Bugs in the system,(graphs) Lucky Star,(trivia) Disguise Combos,(dress up)and Can you fill it? (estimating). The only good thing about Cyberchase is Gilbert Gottfried. Gilbert Gottfried is FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY. His voice always makes me laugh, and he is great in live action films such as Look Who's Talking Too. Cyberchase is all about fun, math, and the show is funny.Rating: 8/10Website: AShow: F"
3,Rape and Music,"Rape and brutality were accompanied with nice violin tunes as Mexican peasants fought for a better life with no visual outcome yet.What is utterly clear, musical education was then affordable in Mexico."
2,"Goes nowhere, does nothing","A bleak landscape traversed by desolate and beaten peasants, running from people in uniforms. Who are they? What is happening? Why?This is one slow film, starting at grim and going down from there. The lone interesting feature, other than the amazing presence of the old man who plays Plutarco, is the decidedly non-Hollywood ending. The rest of the world is not as relentlessly optimistic as we are. And, judging by the characters and events portrayed here, not without reason."
4,hey chris,"Nice review of yr own album! Bwaaaa!!! But hey, GPL is good. Take his word on it. Maybe not ""best in last 10 years"" good -- I liked In/Humanity better, sorry -- but good nonetheless.Spazzy, fast, artsy 'core -- put Gauze and Nation of Ulysses in a blender and get THIS monstrosity. Smashismo!"
3,More of Susan Hayward Than Gary Cooper,"The plot is very simple and there is not much action. It is all about Leah Fuller (Susan Hayward)'s struggle with gold, love and life.It is another western, watchable."
2,Worst technology ever owned,"This is the worst piece of technology I've ever owned. The software crashes *every* time I use it, sometimes 10 or more times in a normal route or usage session. The points of interest database is weak, small, unreliable, and not organized well. The routes suck. Given instructions are often just dumb. The software is completely useless when it comes to re-routes, such as when you miss a turn or want to take a different route.And worst of all, which is completely unacceptable for a GPS unit:There are *NO* updates available to the software, firmware, or OS at Holux's site. In fact there are *no* updates of any kind there. Even the FAQs are worthless.Yes, I bought the thing cheap. But it would've been well worth the extra money for a usable, reliable, updated, stable piece of kit, instead of saving a few bucks and getting such the piece of ... well, you know what word I wanna use."
2,Kind of Babyish,I think Karen whines a little to much and gets everything that she wants. The first book i ever read was Karens Roller Skates. I really liked that one because it told half about reality. That is my review.
1,B-A-D,"Well, I think the plot of the books are all kind of BORING.But what bugs me most is that Karen thinks it's WONDERFUL to havedivorced parents. That's not good. Most children who have divorced parents don't like it. Do you really want Your child to think: if mommy and daddt get divorced, the will both re-marry right away, and at least one of your step parents will be a millionare? And both of your step parents will be nice angels? That you will have wonderful new pets and lots of really nice step sisters and step brothers that drive you around. I don't think so."
2,Karen Bugs Me!,"I used to read these books when I was 7 or 8, but even at 9 I started to see through them. I think Karen is very annoying and treats her friends awfuly. I believe Nancy and Hannie are very tolerant of Karen's childish behavior and are all around, very nice girls. In ""Karen's Witch"" she thinks that her neighbor is a witch. She ends up embarassing Ms.Porter, herself and Hannie. Hannie seams to go along with Karen's scheems a little too easily. I still enjoy the ""Baby Sitters Club"" series, because the situations are more realistic."
2,Kool Kat is cool,Absolutely love this pair of sandals. I got my first one from a local dept store and got the second one from Amazon. I was planning on getting 3 more had the size been available. I was lucky there was one left when I ordered. Very comfortable and got a lot of compliments from friends. Its classic design will never get old. I hope I can find some from other websites.
1,A reign of Error,"Bud Selig's run as CEO of baseball has damaged the game. Adding a wild card was good. Inter-league play has lost it's novelty, a labor dispute cancelled the World Series, (something Hitler or Osama could not achieve)and greed combined with feigned ignorance led to the worse drug scandle in sports history.The next best day in MLB is when Bud steps down, and a real commissioner takes the helm, not some lackey for the owners."
2,"Great concept, but the Devil is in the details....","What a crushing disappointment this book is. I couldn't help but be distracted from Zimbalist's thesis by the all too numerous typos and other errors. Albert Bell, Robb Nenn, Lou Pirini just to name a few misspellings. There are factual errors as well. I don't know whether this book needed a better editor or they just didn't care. Eitherway, this book is one to avoid for the serious baseball fan."
5,fun gift,"educational and fun gift. I keep these on hand for ""emergency gifts"". Those times when you need a gift quick."
4,Very nice score :),"I caught this album while looking through other works by Fritz Heede. Really good as music to sit outside and draw or read a book by. The tracks are well worked and flow nicely. Reminds me of a divine camping trip or a nature-themed wedding.His past works, however, were only slightly more inventive in the instramentation.Otherwise, a nice set of tracks. :)"
4,"Classic anime, not great but watchable and loads of fun.","Super Dimensional Calvary was another anime series in Japan that caught on in the U.S. A direct sequel to Macross.Not as great as Macross but fun in it's own way. Too bad the toys and model kits didn't sell in Japan, the series was ended and wrapped all too quickly. The americanized version was dubbed The Robotech Masters. It was re-edited and dubbed so it could follow right after the first Robotech series. The original takes place years and in a different universe than Macross. If you enjoy Robotech this set is worth a look, it's uncut and in it's original language.Strongly recommended."
5,One of My Favorites and will be yours too,This is one of the best.You will enjoy every minute.The Mixture of Mystery Suspence Murder and The Highest humor youll get.The best part is with the moving candles.Youll love the changing room too.
5,The funniest Abbott and Costello movie ever,"This is by no doubt the funniest of all Abbott & Costello movies ever made. I also liked this movie because of Richard Carlson's performance. I remember him from CREATURE OF THE BLACK LAGOON and he's really good in horror and comedy movies. My review's not going to what happens in the movie, like a summary, but I'm going to give you my impression of this movie.First of all, when Costello slides down a railing, I laughed the hardest I ever did in my life. I just kept talking about that. And also, Costello's performance in the whole movie is funny. What Costello does with a gun is funny, his waiter job part is funny, and when he falls from the bed when the room transforms is so funny. Well, I don't want to say any more except that I think that all fans MUST see this one."
5,Groovy,"The Best of the Abbot and Costello movies it has thrils, chills and spils. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen it is one of those great movies that you cant see just once."
1,Gosh darn awful!,"This is one of the poorest quality DVDs I've ever seen.Image on MISTER SCARFACE is blurry and the audio indistinct. It's clearly dubbed from VHS, with an overdark, grainy picture. Laughably, at one point early on the words VIDEO CALIBRATION flash across the screen!COP IN BLUE JEANS has better sound but is incredibly out-of-focus.For shame, PASSION PRODUCTIONS.Caveat emptor folks."
1,Too Difficult,"Was expecting a much easier to understand and guided process. Instead it's a hard to understand and not very friendly to the back yard mechanic in my opinion. It could have given far better, detailed instructions, as to actually how to do the things written about. Was pretty much a waste of my money."
2,Fatal Mambo is not so fatal,"Other reviewers claim Fatal Mambo made their feet move, but I'd say that may be because of the rhythms themselves and not the band. Fatal Mambo is made up of fine musicians who understand Afro-Cuban music well (among other rhythms), but they lack the tightness, the power, the magic one can hear in well known bands such as Eddie Palmieri, Tito Puente, Larry Harlow, and so forth. A acouple of tracks (Salsaioli & Tu Le Sais) reminded me of Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, but again fell short in tightness, power, and magic. I was disappointed the band did not credit the composers of some of the well pieces they reinterpreted. Overall, this CD is interesting from the listening point, but very weak from the dancer's perspective."
1,Fatal Mambo (Import),"Import was a nice effort but fell far short of fatal Mambos first release this CD was stale and had no groove what so ever. In the land of Mambo & Salsa my Cuban and Puerto Rican brothers are still kings i.e. Cubanismo and Eddie Palmierri. Yo digo si vas a bailar... ""BAILA"" con musica buena!"
3,Less Than Stellar,"The format of this book is too busy: a lot of wasted pages with single-sentence quotes pulled out and printed as stand-alone blurbs; too many hypothetical speeches inserted into the text; and overdone spotlights on ""regular"" Americans who have been hurt by Bush's policies (preaching to the choir here, since it's likely all lefties buying the book). Huffington swerves from guffaw-seeking to self-important attempts at loftiness, and neither one really works. It seems as if she thinks that people have been waiting for her to deliver this oracle of advice to Democrats, so that we can now finally know how to take our country back. But despite her inflated sense of gravitas, there isn't much of substance in her prescriptions beyond the usual liberal fare. For funnier and more trenchant stuff, go with Al Franken and Michael Moore. For more interesting substance, see anything by Lewis Lapham, the current book from Thomas Frank (""What's the Matter with Kansas?""), or the David Corn book."
1,Argumentum ad Hominum,"I find it interesting that in the pages I scanned through that I couldn't find a single fact. All I found was the fallacy of ""Argumentum ad Hominum"" (Argument against the Man i.e. ""He's a schmuck therefore anything he says or does isn't valid"") Now, granted, I didn't (couldn't) read the whole book so I don't know if she got into any actual facts that could be looked up and verified but just the fact that what I did read was so obviously skewed by emotion doesn't lend any credence with me of the facts. I am NOT a Republican but I do like my information to be clear, concise and to have the ability to be verified. I do not appreciate ""scare"" tactics or emotional string pulling. Let me decide what my emotions should be by giving me the FACTS!"
4,Remember she once supported the Republicrats,"Arianna was on Howard Stern's show last week speaking against Bush but remember she also was married to a Republicrat (Republican = Democrat) until she found out he was gay. How she supports the Demopublicans. This woman is an opportunist who will support whoever will pay her. She is a media whore and worse, she is not even a native born Amerikan. If she doesn't like Bush or our political system when her side is out of power, go back to Greece. Live in that third world country. GO BACK"
2,Poor sound,"Though a little more Pogues-influenced than their ""A Melody of Retreads and Broken Quills,"" this cd was very disappointing. They have a Celtic sound to them, but it is very slight. They seem to be more of a Swingin Utters-like band. I would not recommend this album for those who are looking for a band like the Tossers, the Pogues, Flogging Molly, or Blood or Whiskey."
3,"Good shipping time and right product, but bad condition","Well, the shipping was very quick, and the product was definitely what was ordered, but the inside plastic was broken, and that scratched a few of the disks. Not badly, they were still playable, but we had to get little paper cases so that the disks would be save and we could still keep them in the box.Kind of disappointing, but altogether it wasn't awful."
3,"Great show, Not so great DVD","3rd Rock From the Sun remained a great comedy throughout it's entire run, and the humor has aged very well. In my opinion, this is the funniest show ever on American television. Unfortunately, the ""extra"" features on the DVD this season add up to about 6 minutes of fluff. At least season 3 gave us a few commentaries, but even then some of the commentary was terrible - I'd have expected more from French Stewart. Even so, this is an easy purchase to recommend, but Anchor Bay would do better releasing these season sets bare bones rather than giving us ""extras"" that just get worse with each season set.Funniest moment from this season:William Shatner: I saw something on the wing!John Lithgow: I saw something on the wing too!(It's an inside joke referring to the twilight zone series and movie, so everybody may not ""get it""."
4,Just as funny as always....,We still enjoy this sitcom. We have all the dvds that we could order and watch them in the rain forest where there is no television reception. Makes our day... Mahalo plenty...
5,so very funny!:),"If you liked seasons 1-3, you will love 4. (plus it has william shatner, gotta love shatner!)"
3,Packaging and video smelled of orange!,The Video was great but it reeked of some kind of orange cleaner....even the packaging stunk so bad I had to throw it away before I got home....car even reeked!
5,Loved it.,"This is a show I love and it has that special quality which defies the passage of time. The material remains funny, fresh and entertaining!"
5,Funny!,This is a great DVD at a great value. The show is as funny as I remember it. I highly recommend it to all.
4,Good SciFi with humor,"Good sci-fi. There is the light humor that was also found in Hercules, another of Sorbo's efforts. At times, things get serious, but that part never gets overbearing. If you want good playful entertaining sci-fi, this is it."
5,Still classic Andromeda,"There is no letoff in Season 2 of Andromeda. The characters by now are much more well known, but we still see the formula of a central character of the crew being featured.So far I have yet to find an episode I don't like."
2,Very disappointed after all the ***** reviews!,"I was expecting something transcending the normal after reading the reviews and hearing the clips.... imagine my disappointment on listening to the complete CD - very average, the voice does not quite hit the spot and the background 'music' is less than appealing. Compare it with 'Voices of Angels' perfect rendition of the same music, totally unaccompanied - or 'Anonymous 4's almost-as-good offering - and you will agree that there is no comparison. Not recommended."
1,Makes me want to puke,"I just can't understand how those who made that CD can say that they respect medieval music while they prostitute it. Of course, if they had't put some synths, people would not have bought it."
2,"Just, OK... He's not really trying","OK, so he mixed it up on this album, tried a few different things. Just because you do something different, doesn't mean it's good. This album isn't good. It's just OK.I can't vouch for how true country fans feel. I don't like new country, but I've loved Junior Brown's work for years. The rest of the new country music out there is just lifeless, and poppy standard music.... that's where this disc went. The exuberance of his past albums relied on fun guitar work, and silly songs. This album has the silly songs, but the guit-steel (his trademark) just seems like an aside. Overall, this album is upbeat, but stale and very corny. I just don't feel that there is any edge or real soul put into this album. It's very disappointing."
2,"Keep one finger on the ""next track"" button","We waited three years for this? As a huge Junior fan and frequent concert-goer, I bought the new release unheard, but I was seriously disappointed by the lack of fire on this CD. Junior seems to be trying for a gimmick hit ballad (Little Town Square? Puh-leeze.) to get some CMT airplay, but that's not why we buy the albums. I took out Long Walk Home yesterday to see if time makes the boring stuff less boring. Nope. Now, not all of Junior's slow songs are dull, but Junior should know what we want--we want to hear some strings get tore up. He doesn't record enough to have this many weak songs on an album. This one's going on the shelf."
4,Mixed Bag- Classic Junior Brown!,Great CD from Junior Brown. Fast and Twangy plus some great slow songs. At his Best!
3,"I gave it a 3, just because its Junior",I must admit I was a little disappointed with this release. It seems to lack the West Texas flavor that Junior has brought back to us. I have always liked his forays into other musical genres that clearly show that most types of music are inextricably linked (i.e. Hendrix rifts in a Hawaian steel tune on a country CD) but this release just seems to be thrown together for the sake of releasing a CD. I will continue to throw it in the player from time to time and hope it grows on me. I realize that most negative reviews do not see the light of day on Amazon so I gave it a 3 just because its Junior. I hope that he can focus on what makes him who he is and I certainly hope that the reponse to this CD does not force him back into retirement on the farm with the old Chevy truck. I'll still buy his next one but probably won't listen to this one.
2,Junior loses the magic in the studio,While there are some good moments on this CD (although few & far between) Mr Brown doesnt seem to shine on CD like he does live. Fans of his ear-bleeding live shows will be severly dissapointing. Sounds like Hank Williams Sr. Save your cash for the next time he comes to your town. You wont be dissapointed (unless you buy this CD)
5,another great one,"this guy is amazing - the albums are great, the live shows are even better. buy the record, see the shows!"
3,Weak battery. Runs down too fast,"Overall, the camera fits snuggly in the hand. Good ergonomics. The major problems are poor battery performance and the lens cap has no means of being secured to the camera. Consequently, you are always looking for it. Both these problems are easily fixed and should be if Olympus wants to have a top-selling product"
2,"Eats Batteries, Floppy Disk Adapter is Impossible","Boy, was I disappointed in this one. Relatively easy to set up, but then found that the click action of the picture set up had me fooled, I thought I was taking pictures and I wasn't. When I did, I found out that 15 were all I could get on the card before I had to upload. Figuring out how to upload with the floppy disk adapter proved too much. I am packing it up and sending it back."
5,"a great product, but what to do about a carrying case?","I love this camera. A few things that are annoying. When I turn on the camera the lens part telescopes out and I usually forget about the lens cap and it winds up popping off. I've done that a bunch of times... One other thing, I wish I could find a carrying case that fits well. The lens that sticks out makes it difficult to find one that fits well..."
4,The C-2000 is great for IR photos without modifcation,"This product has been out of production for some time, but it is working just as I expected and have no complaints. It is only one of a couple of cameras that can shoot infrared images without modification."
4,"Manual control, pc sync, and great color.","Excellent color rendition with my studio strobe that none of my other shootn'point digitals can handle. I love the full manual control, and the pc sync so I can hook it up to a studio strobe. The only demerit is the smartmedia card - as you may know they tend to corrupt very easily, and are expensive."
5,The catalogue of Borges poetry,"The poetry of Borges contains descriptions of the streets of Buenos Aires, and stories of distant battles of his ancestors, the pampas, compasses, hourglasses, the smell and taste of coffee, portraits of Emerson, Spinoza, Joyce, games with time and infinity, references to Schopenhauer, Stevenson, Browning,Whitman, encyclopediac searchings to find texts that contain and define the realities they cannot wholly describe, meditations on darkness and blindness and loss of light, Milton- like, a love of the world of literary creation, and its tradition, mysteries of meaning, ruminations on fame, -It is a poetry that instructs and delights, a poetry of mind and meditation more than of intense human connection.The great great pleasure of a true literary masterwork."
3,waste of time,"just brainwashing you. must resist.people, you can find happiness in a relationship without the bible.ill let you know when i find mine."
1,how sad this band is,this band is one of the sadest I have ever personally heard. You can not have a fast band like that and then sing like you normally would and not deepen your voice at all if you read this do not buy this cd.
5,The only book on technique that you will ever need,"I bought this book a year ago, after accumulating many other books by ""big names"" in the weightlifting field. This book is the best, by far. The descriptions of the exercises are very, very detailed, with plenty of pictures. The author has no ""axe to grind"" - he doesn't sell vitamins, supplements, or equipment. I have not opened up any of my other similar books since I bought this one."
4,An excellent book on how to train injury free,"This is an excellent book with detailed explanations of 34 excercises with photographs that eliminate guessing. Not a comprehensive book, more information on the author's philosophy is in ""Beyond Brawn"" and this book is meant to be a companion to that text. Unfortunately, Beyond Brawn is about five times longer than it needs to be, and the author should have condensed that information down to about 100 pages and made it the first section of this book. Then the author would have had THE comprehensive text for beginners and the 95 percent of us out there that aren't genetically gifted. Extremely useful, but falls short of what could have been."
5,Definitely in the top ten of weight training books,"I read all the reviews about this book and they sounded impressive. Went ahead and placed the order and it took me more than six months before I could lay my hands on it, since it was out of stock. This book was worth the wait. Very thorough and insightful and makes a lot of sense. You gain so much knowledge that you can't help feeling like an expert. My approach to weight training nowadays is more practical."
5,Stuff you'd learn on your own in 15 years.,"Theres nothing really more to say.He tells you how to lift weights, then he tells you stuff only those old guys in the corner of the gym would tell you if they weren't so anti-social. Technique, tips, ideas, and great concepts."
5,This book is essential reading for weight trainees.,"This is the book that people wish they had when they started lifting. If you're just starting out now, this is the book you NEED to have. It teaches you what the productive (ie - strength and size producing) exercises are and how to do them effectively and safely. There's even a section on flexibility management. Each exercise is written up in great detail along with alternate forms of the exercise, tips, and practices to avoid with each exercise. Also, every exercise is illustrated with photographs that, when combined with the text, show you exactly how to perform each exercise safely and effectively. I strongly recommend this book to everyone who trains with weights."
5,The Insider's Tell-All Handbook On Weight-Training Technique,"This book should be on the shelf of every weight-trainer!! McRoberts has taken the time to genuinely address the realities of correctly performing virtually every safe strength producing movement available(Olympic lifts excepted). In my own experience it has allowed me to progress from constant minor injuries to none in less than a year while at the same time learning to both deadlift and squat correctly. The information in this book, when followed, will let you lift intensely, without injury. In my case it also explained how I was being injured by my technique before I'd been exposed to this book.The only criticism of this book that I've ever run across is that Stuart erred on the conservative side and did not include a few productive movements that are generally safe for most people.With that said; I must tell you that this book is, hands down, the best book on lifting technique currently available anywhere on the market."
4,good pieces of info,"mainly information as adjuncts to more common knowledge that improves on your form factor and performance looking out to avoid injury usually culminated over time and use.for example one advice it emphasizes in bench press is to lower the bar to the lower pec region and not the shoulders which puts the shoulders in undue pressure, and then push up in a plane that is diagonal which finishes at the end point above the shoulders.Many points to this effect and also a lot of advice to the correct posture of the spine and back and also breathing form."
2,Antiquated,"Mediocre black-and-white photographs. By today's standards, this is a pretty primitive way to depict body movements. You can find instructional videos on YouTube for all of these exercises and a dozen times more, full color and full motion."
2,Not the greatest,"Not the best book on technique. Lots of wasted space on exercises you'll never perform. Some iffy advice...deadlift with an overhand grip, bench with a flat back, etc. There are much better books in the genre that teach better advice on more pertinent lifts. Seriously, will you be doing lever forearm work or ball squats in the near future?"
1,Keep your money!!,"How this video got a three and a half star I don't know. I was very disappointed. If I hadn't spent my money, I would want to laugh myself silly. I watched it all the way through. The young girls she has working with her are so sad and unhappy, I don't think they wanted to be in the video. And who did the decorations? Look like someone threw some material up to hide something. I was hoping it wouldn't fall down. I should have listen to that one review to save my money. I'm telling you they were right,don't buy save your money!"
2,not good,I love african music and dance but was not what i thought it was going to be.... it's actually boring!
1,Never Had a Chance,"I would like to be able to review this, but I can't because I never got a chance to watch it. For some reason I lost this movie and others that up and dissappered from my rental list. I am sure that they dissapered prior to my time being up. So I have to give this a 1."
5,Refiner's fire series,"I just finnished the third book in this series and have been very impressed with the stories. I really enjoyed Fire by Night. The stories had great messages of courage and enduring the trials that God puts into our lives to mold and shape us so we can become His. The books, though religious in nature, were not obviously one denomination or another. They just held simple truths that all christian religions could appreciate. GOOD STUFF!!!!!!!!!!"
5,First books to make me cry!,"Lynn does such an amazing job with the characters. I felt for them so much, and DID NOT want the books to be over with! I love these books. The second I have to say is my favorite, but the first one did make me cry! The third is really good, it just breaks my heart on how they use to treat the slaves. A MUST READ!"
5,Rick Springfield Comic Book Heros,I have this in vinyl with along with several others as i have been a fan since 1972 and this is my fave one of all the albums.
5,A great trip down memory lane,"I got this album back in 1973 as kid because I was initially attracted to the cover and thought it would be about the Superfriends! What I discovered was a collection of songs that really did run through the entire gamut of emotions. I remember running around the playground and jumping off the swings singing ""I'm Your Superman...oh yes I am!"". Other songs like ""Misty Water Woman"" and ""Liar"" were kind of spooky and mysterious. At the time, I couldn't decide whether this was a kids album or one for adults but later I realized it was the latter. These days when I listen to it, the nostalgia kicks in but what I'm left with is how great these songs really are.If you're a fan of Rick's mega hits, you really should check out this record to see where he came from and what he's capable of as a composer. Highly recommended."
4,Comic Book Heroes,"I bought this disc specifically because I wanted to hear Misty Water Woman. I love it! I also really like Weep No More, Believe In Me, The Liar (my 14 yr old digs this one, too), and Born Out of Time. I like the other songs as well, but these five are my favorites. I am very glad that I bought the disc, and would recommend it to friends."
5,WOW!!! This is sky high!!! Higher than SUPERMAN!!!,"I had this one on cassette YEARS ago!!! Now that I own it again....it's even better than I remember! The best song on this one that I recommend is ""Misty Water Woman""!!! GO RICK!!!!"
2,"Pamphlet, not paperback","This ""paperback"" should be labelled as a ""pamphlet"" instead. It's a small brochure style booklet with probably less than two dozen pages. The information in it is good, though. Paintings seem to be accurate, and descriptions are good."
2,NOT SO PLEASED,I was anxious to read this book but was disappointed when I saw it was the scripture with what I thought were rather strange drawings. It gave me no insight into Revelation.
