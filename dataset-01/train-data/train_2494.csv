3,Not for Harry Potter fans,"I'm not sure which age group this book is good for. If judged by the writing, it's good for young children 4th-6th grade. However, I doubt children in this age group will be familiar with the many references to the Greek Gods, their relationships and stories.This book is very similar to Harry Potter, with slight changes here and there. It speaks of a Half-Blood (son of God and mortal) going on a quest with two sidekicks, another Half-Blood girl and a satyr. He attends a school for Half-Bloods, the only safe place for him because monsters are hunting him down. Even though the storyline sounds familiar, compared to Harry Potter, the writing style and story development are at different levels. Adult fans of the Harry Potter series will find this book predictable and well, childish. I am also a fan of Greek mythology, so I was really hoping this will be a good read; I was disappointed."
4,Good Mythology,I liked how this flowed naturally and the camp was all original while touching on Greek mythology. The material use was also effectively told.The concept of mating with mortals was an interesting.The whole series is great.
4,Adults will enjoy this too,"I found this book while searching (hoping) for a new Rick Riordan Tres Navarre story. Why was he wasting time with young adult books when he should be telling us about Tres? When I looked closer and saw the plot was about modern demigods living among us, I had to give this book a chance. A great treat for adults who love mythology as well as for the target audience of young(er) adults. My sister (50) liked it as much as my niece (11). I couldn't wait for the second installment!"
5,Excellent reluctant reader choice!,"If you know a reluctant adolescent reader, hand him or her this book! Not only is it nonstop action, but the reader's knowledge of mythology will expand as well. It is full of teasers about the backgrounds of gods and godesses. There aren't too many mythological monsters Percy and his friends miss, either! Young readers who struggle in school will identify with Percy's school problems-dyslexia and ADD-and will be pleased to learn that while he doesn't function well in school, outside of school he's got lots of talents. He's one heck of a swordsman, a problem solver, and is pretty good at being a hero! Once they've read this one and are eager for another, the newest book (second in a planned trilogy), The Sea of Monsters, is waiting in the wings!"
4,Love it than the movie,"This book awakened the kid in me and made me travel to the farthest part of my mind which is my imagination. Percy is quite a lovable school boy who was blamed and thought to steal Zeus' lighting bolt. From the plot itself, it is very interesting. I also love Greek mythology and how Riordan incorporates them to create a wonderful story is really fascinating. A good book for any given day. Keep it up!"
5,Great graphic novel,My 8 & 9 yr olds love this book! It's a bit easier than the full novel & graphic novels are definitely in with the kids since the wimpy kid books gained popularity.
3,Harry Potter it was not,"I don't want to compare it to HP, but it is obvious that is what this book was hoping to be. Overall the book was okay. It is rather straight forward. It doesn't have a lot of mystery to it. If you've finished highschool mythology, then this book doesn't present a lot to mystify you. It wasn't badly written, just kind of plain. I'm going to try the second one and see if it gets any better."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!!,(Son) Liam- I was at my school library looking for a book (which i do not do often) when my best friend recommend this book. It looked a little bit dorky at first but when I began to read it I could not put it down literally! I normally don't enjoy reading because it takes so long for a book to get interesting but this one kept me entertained all the way through. This is WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE! You must read this book! I can't wait to check-out the rest of the series!
3,an okay book,honestly the plot was great though it seems so much like harry potter with half bloods and a special place for the magic people i dont think rick riordan is that great of an author but its worth reading
3,I was expecting a little better,"Basically, the writing was bland, pretty dull. I'm an adult, I very much enjoy reading tween books on occasion, and got this book thinking it would be a nice read. It IS in general, but oh so boring. I would say this book is right there with the 8-10 year old crowd, not the 12+.The biggest problem I had was Percy's mother, and how the author did not, could not, convey any emotional sadness or distress from the main character. The mother, after her disappearance was thrown in as a side note, from time to time. (trying not to put a spoiler in here, if you've read the book, you know what I mean)Read it if you want, enjoy it too, but be prepared to yawn a bit."
3,Harry Potter knockoff but not as good.,"This has so many similarities to Harry Potter, I'm surprised there hasn't been a lawsuit."
5,My son couldn't put it down,"I was recommended this book by a friend of mine and I had to ordered it from the US cause it was sold out where I live (Philippines). When I received I thought my son would not like to read such a big book but I was in for a big surprise. Let me tell you my 10 year old son is also dyslexic and ALWAYS try to read the smallest books if possible. The moment he open this book that was it, instant hook up! He was not done reading this one that he was asking me to buy the rest of the series. I bought last week ""The sea of monsters"" and he has been in trouble because he even missed one soccer club in school cause he wanted to read... It never happened before, trust me! I'm delighted to see my son so much into reading and having so much fun with a book.Thank you so much Mr. Riordan and keep the stories coming!!"
5,Great for Adventure Seekers,"""The Lightning Thief, by Rick Riordan, is a great book for readers who like adventures. This book is an exciting story with mythology and a little humor thrown into it.Percy Jackson is a Half-Blood ( son of a god ) and is accused of stealing Zeus' Master Bolt. Can Percy return the Bolt to Zeus or will he be killed trying to?Join Percy, Annabeth and Grover to find out in The Lightning Thief!""This is my son's review (age 10). Enjoy!"
5,I LOVE THEM,"I am a girl,and surprisingly; I LOVE THESE BOOKS! They are a great choice for anyone, and are filled with humor. So start reading!"
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!,"This book is amazing. It is a very action packed book about the Greek gods which covers everything, from satyr to Madussa. This book is a very fun read which pulls you in - It makes you read more and more. The main character is a twelve-year old boy named Percy Jackson. Percy has dyslexia which causes him to see words in a different way than us. Since Percy has dyslexia and for other reasons that I will not dislcose (for fear of giving the secrets away), he has gotten kicked out of many boarding schools. Also Percy is what they call a ""Half Blood."" Read the book and you will find out more about Percy Jackson's exciting quests."
5,"A great Mythology-based Book for kids, and Parents","Riordan is known in San Antonio as a favorite as resident author. He's taught at both high school and college level and writes mystery books in the interim. I'm glad he's decided to create a series for the younger crowd that his Mystery novels don't usually include. This book shows that he truly knows his audience. It brings Greek Mythology to kids in a way that is fun and exciting. It creates interest that makes kids want to learn more about their favorite characters. Percy's teachers are Gods and Centaurs and his friends are nymphs, satyrs, and demi-gods, sons and daughters of gods. Percy's dad is ________, one of the great gods (yeah like I'm gonna ruin it). Join Percy in his climb to the top of the Empire State building and his descent into the depths of hell (in an LA music studio, of course) it's a great ride, I recommend for everyone."
5,Great for boys,"My 11 year old son has never been a huge fan of reading, but when his friends read and raved about this book to him, he asked me to order it for him. He loved it and immediately asked for the second book in the series. He expects to finish that one this weekend and has already asked me to order the third book. As you would expect, I strongly recommend this book for young men!!!"
5,Great book.,I love this series. One tip- try to make the jokes actually funny. I read this book like a hundred times. They should make a video game of it. I love this book
5,Awesome,I am a ten tear old and I watched the movie last month. I thought this was better than the movie. Procrustes is weird.
5,Great,Greatly written book!!Try the other books in the seriesThe last olimpian is my favorite book in the series
5,Ancient Greece,I like the Gods of Olympus and all Ancient Greece myths. This was easy to read kind of funny and well thought through. I saw the movie as well and wanted comparison to the original. Enjoyed it and now I'm gonna read the next story in the sequel;-)
5,Brilliant,Excellent story telling so many differences from the movie. My ten year old read this book in three days he could not put it down. Every day after school he went straight to it.
5,Great story for any age,"I was looking for something new to read and Was introduced to this series by 2 friends and now can't wait to start book two. Fast moving, likeable characters and a really fun story. Read this book in two days and look forward to seeing what happens next!"
5,Awesome for independant entertainment,"My daughter really enjoys listening to Rick Riordan's books on CD. The reading level is a bit above her, but she can certainly listen to them, understand them and enjoy them without my help. This is a much nicer alternative to watching television. I also put them in my iPod and then she can listen to them when we are on long car rides or when she is waiting at an appointment with me.I love Jesse Berstein as the reader. He sounds just like I imagine Percy to sound. I often enjoy listening to these CDs with my daughter before bed. Unlike the Red Pyramid CDs, there are a normal number of tracks per CD, about 15, so it is easier to fast forward to pick up where we left off the last time we were listening. Also, the price on The Lightening Thief is very reasonable compared to the other audio books in this series."
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A truly ELECTRIFYING novel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Prepare for the best thrill ride. Hop on and strap into this marvelous book. The suspense takes you on a ride that you just want to continuously get back on. once you read the first you gotta read them all.
5,Daughter Loved It!,"I got this for my daughter. She was reading it for a class assignment, and read it AFTER the movie. She liked it better. Isn't that almost always the case? That's all I have. Considering the movie was great in my opinion, if the book is better, it's gotta be fantastic!"
5,Lightning Thief Strikes Again,"My 11 year-old insisted I read this book. It's only fair that I read what my kids suggest since I'm constantly making suggestions for them. :)GREAT BOOK! I love learning about mythology while being entertained. I know you've heard this before: the book is better than the movie. But I still enjoy the movie.My 11 year old gave me the next book in the series with a note: ""If you enjoyed Lightning Thief you'll like this book too!"""
4,astonishing,Rick Riordan did a great job puting these books together. I recomend this book to all who have an intrest in greek mythology. I give this book five stars. It`s one of those books that you just cant put down let alone go to bed at night. this first book introduces all the characters. if you get the sample youll be sure to love it
4,Thrill Ride,"Percy Jackson has a lot in common with Harry Potter - both are youngsters who discover they have special powers, both are teamed with a male and female friend to form a trio for going on quests. Percy Jackson is a more modern tale than Harry Potter, but still manages to weave in the lore of the Gods of Olympus. I enjoyed this book very much and recommend it to others. Although it is written for young adult readers, adults should find it equally exciting."
2,Pretty bad...,"I took out this book at my local library because I had heard of it, but it was pretty bad. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it if I were a little younger - the story is not very original but when I was younger I loved stories about becoming an unexpected hero. The language is pretty simple and the story doesn't really develop. I never felt like there was something I was looking forward to, it took me actual energy to keep reading it. I do think this is geared for a younger audience, with the simple language and the weird references to NYC, the empire state building, ect. I feel like if I read it younger though, it wouldn't be so bad but I wouldn't really have been in love with it.I recommend this book for people around age 13 but really no one older than that."
4,Entertaining,"I love mythology so after I saw the movie adaptation, I bought the entire book series to read. I find that there were parts I enjoyed more in the movie than in the book, and vice versa. For example, I thought the movie's version about the three pearls was more creative than the way the book described this. I know readers tend to like the books more, but I felt like the movie made a great decision when they changed this. With that being said, I loved the scene in the book about Waterland concerning Ares and Aphrodite- I thought that was a fantastic scene and I tip my hat to Rick Riordan.In short, this was an enjoyable read- even for someone well above the age-target and I recommend others to read it if you're interested at all in mythology!"
5,The Lightning Thief,"This is the first book in a young adult series. I am really glad I saw the movie before reading the book--otherwise, I would have hated the movie. The movie left out tons of book action! In the book, Percy Jackson discovers he is a demi-god: half human, half god. He goes to Half Blood Camp to figure out which god is his father and after that, he is sent on a quest. His quest is to find the stolen lightning bolt of Zeus and return it to the mighty god. This book had tons of action, great characters (I loved Grover--Percy's protector who is a goat disguised as a human) and a lot of humor. I have the rest of this series on my Kindle and look forward to reading them. These books can span the YA audience and adults could love them too.[...]"
3,"A good start to the series, but...","This is a good starting book of a young adult series. Full of adventure and clever dialogue, it was pretty entertaining. Definitely helps to have a basic understanding of Greek mythology (or else some of the jokes won't seem so funny!). I can see how this book would hold great appeal for middle schoolers. As an adult reader and future teacher, while I enjoyed reading this one, it wasn't 'unputdownable' and the writing and vocabulary choice were a little lacking, in my opinion. But I would recommend it for a fun summer-y read and to middle schoolers looking to read a clever adventure series."
5,Kid's Review,"This book is so good! I recommend this book all the way. The main characters are Percy Jackson, Anabeth, and Grover (a satyr.) Percy is the son of Poseidon. Anabeth is a daughter of Athena. And Grover is just a satyr. The problem is that Zeus's master bolt is stolen. And they accuse Percy of it. This zapping tale will keep you on the edge of your seat. I give this electrifying story five stars. On the way to retrieve this magic item, they meet a few Greek foes like Medusa, the minotaur, and the Fates. My favorite part is where Percy battles Ares. It's kind of confusing. Ares is Percey's cousin. The setting is Mount Olympus. The time is present. I love this book. by Abby, age 8"
3,Decent - but no Potter.,"I typically like to read a novel before the film version comes out to compare my vision (and that of the author) with the film-makers.With the coming release of ""The Lightning Thief"", I jumped on Book One of Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson Trilogy with great zest. I was not disappointed - though this book is nowhere near J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels.The best thing about the book is how it brings the Greek Gods and other Olympian legends back to life for a new generation to enjoy. Percy Jackson turns out to be a 'half-blood' - born of a mortal mother and dad being the great God, Poseidon. This makes him a target for some less than nice Gods and others and the first adventure spends a lot of time setting the foundation for the series as Percy gets adjusted to life as a 7th Grade Demi-God.A decent read with plenty of action - but I think it will make for a far better movie."
5,one of the best books ever,"In my opinion The Lightning Thief is one of the best books that I have read. The plot is really interesting and exciting. There are also a lot of funny situations that Percy and his friends get into. If you like Greek mythology and a good book this is the book for you. The book is about a kid named Percy, who is the son of Zeus and a mortal. He goes to a summer camp for other kids like him, called halfbloods. He is sent to recover Zeus' lightning bolts that have been stolen. His quest takes him across the country and he finds himself in many life or death situations with ancient Greek monsters. Will Percy be able to find the lightning bolts in time, find out in The Lightning Thief."
5,New and Improved Harry Potter,"This book is similar to harry potter in that it is fantasy, the main character doesn't know what he is etc., but I believe that this book is much better. The Lightning Thief takes the magical aspect of Harry Potter and combines it with some comedy. throughout the entire book there are jokes and pranks that are up to modern times. There are also a lot of action and fight scenes to keep the book moving. The book is a very easy read and could be read by almost anyone 10+. Anyone who loves fantasy or Harry Potter will really like this book"
4,A Fun Way for Kids to get into Mythology,"This series is fun, and a great story for kids. I recommended it to many of my students after our Unit on Greek Mythology and they loved it. It is very similar to Harry Potter in that there is a young boy and a prophecy about him, but I actually find HP to be a little more mature than this series. Regardless it is book fun for adults and kids, as I was number 48 in line to get my copy signed when Rick Riodan came to town last month!"
2,Disappointing,Couldn't have been more of a Harry Potter rip-off if Riordan had given Percy a trident shaped scar on his forehead. I'm surprised Rowling didn't sue.
3,Average,"I have read better books in my life. This book has too many puns for names than I can stand. Also, Percy Jackson is always encountering something new, and I would like it better if the villanous acts stayed the same throughout his journey."
4,Kindle Book,Format is great! The page numbers seem huge but just cause the pages are smaller compared to the paperback form. Other wise good job putting it in ebook form!
5,Percy the Great,This book was a great novel. It held my attention all the way throughout book. This rarely happens because I have short attention span. I would recommend this book to all fiction readers. I loved this book!
3,Kind of a rip-off!,"I bought this book because I like fantasy and I LOVE Harry Potter, thought it might be a new twist. Right away I discovered it's sort of a rip-off of HP mixed with Chronicles of Narnia.It's very fast-paced with little character development and it sort of tosses you right in the middle of everything which can be a little confusing. And if you know your mythology well (or took Latin, which I did!), the turn of events in the book is REALLY predictable.It's interesting enough of a tale, I'd recommend it to vanquish boredom if nothing else, but if you're looking for something to dive into and fall in love with, this isn't the place!"
1,love,Love the whole sereis. So amazing. Love love love it. Rick Riordan is an amazing author. Such a good book
5,Extraordinary...Brilliant...Magical,"If you like greek mythology, you will absolutly ADORE this book. Rick Riordan does a fantastic job bringing greek mythology to modern day life. Its filled with adventure, fun, and excitment. This book kept me flipping the pages. Next thing I knew, I was on the next book, then the next one, then before I knew it I finished the ENTIRE series! This is probably my favorite book, like ever! I <3 Rick Riordan!!! Thank you for taking the time to look at my review dear reader.-watermellonsmiles :D"
3,Fair enough...,"This is a story about a boy who is a demigod, his adjustment problems in many a school, discovery that he is what he is and entry to a boot camp where his ""type"" of people live etc etc. I couldn't really suspend my disbelief, but I am good to read the other books in the series. I would say it is above average book with few laughs thrown in..."
4,The Lightning Thief started my mythical interest,"This book is the first of Rick Riordan's books that I read. I wanted to know what would happen in his next books so I kept buying them. In this one, Percy learns that his father is a god and that is mother was kidnapped by another god. He went to a camp for protection and to learn more about his powers as a demigod. It's an interesting story. It made me want to know more about different types of mythical stories."
4,"Great price, slow service","I ordered this book for my daughter as it was a reading assignment that was supposed to be completed BEFORE the end of the 1st week of school. Classes started on August 22nd and based on the e-mail I received once I placed my order, I was sure I would have it in plenty of time. Unfortunately, it took longer to arrive than expected. Thankfully, my daughter is a quick reader and she LOVED the book. As a matter of fact, she had already seen the movie but the book is very different (typical) and she loved the book so much, she ended up checking the rest of the series out of the library and finishing them ALL in less than 2 weeks!"
5,loved it!,this one of the two series of books that I have been hooked on. I always pre-order the next book and wait in anticipation for it to come out again only to be dissapointed that i finished it in like a week. But if your looking for a good series this is the one for you!
3,"Great plot, childishly written, wasted potential","I only wish I knew the writing level when I purchased this book. The plot is fantastic, yet I was unaware that it was written so simplistically. There was so much room for symbolism and deep meaning, yet it seemed to be cut short due to its level. A deep understanding of greek mythology helped enhance the experience, yet it was not enough to overcome the writing style. I would definitely buy another copy that was written more for adults."
4,Rebooting Greek mythology,"As a casual fan of ancient mythology, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and plan to read the others in the series. Percy Jackson, 6th grade demigod, takes on the monsters of antiquity who are still alive today as he sets out across the USA (and to Hades and Olympus) to find out who stole Zeus' lightning, a crime for which he is being blamed. The gentle humor and kid-friendly action are winsome, and the integration of modern technology and real American places with the personalities and plotlines of Greek mythology was clever but not overbearing. Put simply, it works, and if you enjoy young adult fiction and have an interest in classical myths you will almost certainly enjoy this page-turner. So why not give it five stars? I hope and assume that in future books Percy and his friends move on from their relative one-dimensionality."
1,RUBBISH,"I only read 10 pages of this book and had to put it down. i never judge a book until i have finished it, but with percy jackson i had to put it down straight away. the writing technique is useless and the whole story line is a complete copy of harry potter. 0 stars."
1,l i g h t n i n g T h i e f,This was an excellent novel. I highly suggest you read an adaption of The odyssey by Homer prior this story. The book is much more understandable afterwards. All in all Ithis book was very enjoyable and I look forward to reading the next.
1,"Disappointing, to say the least","Riordan should keep his ideas about the inferiority of women out of his books. The formula of fantasy derring-do can be done excellently without dumbing it done or treating woman as inferiors, humiliating people in general or belittling women. The derision of women in these novels disrupts the story. The many derisive references to fools and such nullifies any mechanism of developing a ""bad"" character and lessens almost all of the characters. Riordan lacked the imagination to create a world without incorporating nasty attitudes that should have died an undignified death by now.Many of Riordan's phrases are like ice water in the face and paraphrasing from other better books is shameless. Bah, garbage.This was the first work by Riordan I read. Disbelieving what I read, I got the second novel to make sure the first wasn't an anomaly. Riordan gets no more of my money. One can find better fantasy from authors like Dahl, Grahame, Hiassen, Lewis, Rawn, or Lackey."
1,Percy Jackson and the Olympians: Book 1 The Lightning Thief,WOW! This book was amazing! This book is a rival for the infamous Harry Potter series. I absoloutly LOVED this book. Percy is a cool kid. This series is probably the best I have read in a long time. I would recomend this book series to anyone. By an anonymous fan.
4,The Lightning Thief,"This book was a good book because the author didn't just let Percy find the rod and have a easy way to Olympus, unlike the movie. Percy had to search for the bolt, fight his way to Olympus. He battle multiple times which made the book very awesome.q"
4,Awesome book,This book is awesome. I love it! It's a book you can read again and again without getting bored and when you start reading you can't put the book down. I had to force myself to put the book down when I was reading it. The book is really exciting and you never know what is gonna happen next. It keeps you thinking till the end
2,Awesome,One of the best book I have ever read!even my friend likes it !Best book written in 2012 and 2013!
5,Just wow,Great read. It's a real page turner. I couldn't put it down. I started reading it as a secondary book to read while I finished reading another book. This book got my attention immediately and I still haven't finished reading the original book. Just wow.
5,Best Book Ever,"This book beat Harry Potter and all the books like that. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I hope they have another book that comes out after this one. My favorite part of the book was when he went to find out who was accused of finding the God's belongings. I recommend this book to all ages."
4,Mythology Meets 21st Century,I loved the book. It's a unique mix of mythology and modern times. Rick Riordan makes Greek Mythology fun and his characters suck you in the story so that you feel like you're living it right along with them. A story that can be easily enjoyed by anyone from 10 to 90.
5,Percy Jackson and the Olympians series review,"This book is another one of those amazing books which takes place nowadays, but reveals something crazy that's happening--in this case, the Greek gods are still alive!!! Percy Jackson finds out he is a halfblood (What's this? Read the book!) He goes through adventures, and this as good as the first three books of Maximum Ride, Harry Potter, The Ranger's Apprentice, and many others... So, quick! Order this book and read it!!!"
3,didn't live up to its potential,"an enjoyable enough read but was pretty disappointed given the hype --it didn't live up to the potential of the story and could've easily been three times as long, felt like the story unfolded and concluded too quickly -- Harry Potter similarities were way too obvious."
5,An unexpected pageturner,"Over the summer, I had to read a book for homework and then write about it. The assignment seemed unappealing until I came upon ""Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief."" I read a couple pages thinking ""Oh, another cheezy kid's fantasy."" When I read on, it drew me in. I am not the kind of person who gets excited about reading a book, but this book made me want to read it. I finished the book disappointed that it was over and it made me extemely eager continue the series.I havn't started the second book yet, but I am looking forward to it.READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!"
3,Where do I go after Hogwart's ???,"The Lightning Thief (Percy Jackson and the Olympians, Book 1)Where do I go after Hogwart's? Well, one place you can go is Camp Half-Blood. The book definitely reminded me of Harry Potter. A young misunderstood kid finds out he is the heir to a fantastic heritage. He is the Son of Poseidon the Sea God. As mentioned this first book really felt quite a bit like it was borrowing from Harry Potter and substituting myth for magic, but the later installments took a different tack and the rest of the series made the this book well worth the read."
3,Clever Use of Greek Mythology,"Now that Harry Potter is finished, people will be wading through the glut of young adult fantasy fiction to find the next pot of gold. The first book in Rick Riorden's Percy and the Olympians series won't replace the boy wizard, but is a clever addition to an ever expanding genre. Young Percy Jackson finds out he is the child of a mortal and an Olympic God after nearly losing his life in one breathtaking attempt after another. The fun part here is how the author represents the monsters and myths that so many people are familiar with from the ancient Greek myths. The shortcomings of the book are a general surface tone to the book that never delves deep into Percy's emotions,especially at the loss of someone close to him, and a constant foreshadowing of impending doom that for older readers spoils any surprises that might await our hero. Still for the younger reader a fun adventure series begins that has a clever hook to draw you in."
5,good read,my friend loves this book and is on the last book. he said it is a good book to read please read.
3,Mediocure Writing with a Sub-par Story,"While the language may be ""hip,"" it lacks . . . ummm . . . pretty much anything realistic, exciting, suspensfull, enlightening, or intriguing. I would recommend this book to struggling readers or elementary age students. If you don't fit into one of those categories, save your time and read a real series instead."
3,Not Sure What All the Hype is About,"My son had this book lying around, and so I finally decided to pick it up and read it, after all the hype of the movie and everything. It was okay, I guess it was a little bit entertaining, but nothing that great. In my opinion, Percy Jackson is not an endearing character that invokes feelings of care in the reader. I finished it so I could discuss it with my son, but not because I was actually interested in finding out what was going to happen.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
3,The Lightning Thief Review,I thought this was a good book. I like the the story over all but some of the plots were a little predictable. I like how Percy breaks the rules and does things his own way. I want to see where Anabell's character goes. Also will Grover go on his quest? I am looking forward to the next book and the movie.For more reviews visit: [...]
3,Light Reading for Adolescents,"I thought this book was going to be something different than it was. Although obviously geared for juveniles, I had just finished The Iliad and was primed to read more on Greek mythology. So once I started reading this, I decided to finish it. Of what value Greek mythology (and religion overall) is to modern society is certainly questionable--Jeopardy's esoteric questions perhaps. In grade school I had little interest in mythology, but as it is part of our history, it is important to know it simply because it is part of the evolution of religion. As for as this book is concerned, it is simply fantasy, as is religion. I recommend The Power of Myth and the Encyclopedia of Mythology for anyone wishing to learn more on religion and to get an overall understanding."
5,This is the best book I have ever read,"I liked the adventure--it was super packed with action. I had to be forced to take a break from reading, and every time I took one of those breaks I was super bummed."
5,A great book,"I loved this book about Greek gods and Greek mythology. I gave it 5 stars because it is a sad,shocking,amazing book. I would recommend it to young and old readers. I would recommend reading about Greek mythology before you read this book."
5,Amazing,This book was the best book I have ever read! The best out of all the Percy Jackson's. It was great.
5,"A little different than the movie, but really good.",This is a great book in a great series. I am looking forward to the next movie and book. fits great with other books with the same mythology
3,IT IS JUST OKAY,"THE ENTIRE TIME YOU READ IT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU READ THIS BOOK SOMEWHERE AND IT WAS BETTER. WELL, YOU HAVE. IT IS JUST A REWRITE OF MYTHS WITH A MODERN TWIST. PRO-THE BOOK IS FUN AND EASY TO READ. CON-IT IS LIKE HARRY POTTER LIGHT. OVERALL IF YOU LIKED HARRY POTTER. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE YOU MAY LIKE THIS BOOK."
2,Meh,"This book is a little elementary. Also, it seems like a lot of concepts were taken from Harry Potter. I think there is even a blatent reference to the Potter novels in the book. I like the concept and the use of Ancient Greek themes, but I think the market of people who can enjoy this book is rather small: 8-12 year olds with a comprehension of Ancient Greece."
1,Mixed Message,"The engaging and well-crafted main storyline in this novel earns it one star. The underlying message loses four stars. Percy Jackson, the hero of the story, adores his supposedly-wonderful mother. She has had an affair with Percy's father. She still loves him but purposefully marries a slob, using him as a cover for her son. Percy rationalizes why it is wrong for him to kill this bum, but leaves the means to do so in his dear mother's hands. She does the dirty deed herself. This is presented in the story as clever and funny. Our hero still adores his mother. I can forgive his short-sightedness - he is a kid. Unfortunately, the author of this book is not."
1,Disillusioned (son of Discerning Reader),"Okay, I really wanted to like this story but could only get half way through before it was so stupid I didn't want to finish it.Sure it moved along quickly, and Percy got into one scrape after another - but Aunt M for Medussa? It started out good, and I know a lot of kids liked it to the end so I'm real happy for them. I just didn't like Percy much, or Anabeth, and all that monster stuff was real lame. I like Artemis Fowl, Harry - and Ender's Game is one of my favorite books - all their characters were believable and they were smart. Percy just didn't cut it and I felt like I was in ancient history class."
5,Simply Great: By a Greek Mythology Expert,"This book was great! It is one of my all time favorites. I am a greek mythology maniac and I thought that Riordon cleaverly mixed humor with it. I feel that the people giving this a one star are missing the point, yes he does get some of the stories from greek mythology, but he adds his own unique twists, storylines, and humor in it. Like I said before, this book was great and teaches you greek mythology(I've been an expert before this book)"
5,Love it!,This book has got me back into reading. I really did love this book!Try this book if you need an new series to get hooked on.
5,greek geek,so im a ten year pld girl who loves greek myths and this book is perfect for anyone who is in to myths. i am NOT kidding cause i have loved it so much i have read it 13 times. so i sugest you read this!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Teenage read,Good read. It is fun to read about the mythology you studied in school. But this is still book for a young adult.
5,Awesome,This book is a laugh out loud and clings to the real myths. I love this book and hope you do to
5,The lighting thief,I rated this book a five because I'm the type of kid that loves to read action packed adventures I'm s o glad that I read it at first before I read it I was all like this book was going to suck but it turned out to be really awesome.
5,The lightning theif,Great book! Makes you look at the world in a different way and wonder what's real and what your mind is making real. Definitely read this it was absolutely worth it!
3,"Lions, and tigers and GODS! Oh my.......","I had such hopes for this one. I love studying the Greeks. I love adventure. I was so ready for the ""American Harry Potter."" This isn't it! The characters felt one dimensional, the abundant battle action fell flat and nothing seemed fully fleshed out. I missed the curl of dread in my belly when the characters were in danger - Harry Potter put it there long ago.This author could have done so much with the content, and I'm just mournful that it didn't happen in this book.If this book gets kids to read - G-R-E-A-T! Read it! And then discover better books which pull you in and leave you breathless from the action!"
5,Fun Book with Some Interesting Depth,"I love buying books under the guise of purchasing them for my 9 year old son. The excuse lets me read a lot of great ""kid"" books without looking quite as nutty as I am.Riordan's book is a fun read. I checked out a short encyclopedia of Greek mythology to go along with it, which made looking up all the gods, demi-gods, and monsters quick and easy. I guess you could use Wikipedia for the same.The plot moves along nicely and contains some decent suspense. If you, young or old, like Harry Potter type books, then you will enjoy this."
3,The lightning thief review,"The book was written down towards too low of an age level in my opinion and could have been more adult based rather than childish. However, the book displays a very interesting concept of Greek mythology and legend that I always enjoy reading about."
2,comic book style amateurism,"the graphic novel was adequate, and it included many of the details that the film missed. The graphics were like a comic book, rather than a graphic novel. It reminded me of the old Spider Man comics I used to read when I was younger. But it was better than the film adaptation."
5,Wow,Awesomeness is this book get it trust me it's awesome so it doesn't wast your money just buy Ok so cool.
5,the best series I've ever read,This was a great book. I had to read it for school. When I was done with the first one I counldn't stop reading the rest of the books. If you're into fantsy and adventure you are going to love this book. If you like it get the next one. It just keeps getting better. I just finished the last one when I was camping and at night I read the endding like five times. I hope this helped you.
5,What a fun start to the series.,"Man, this is a great read. What an great idea for a story. Percy Jackson is 11 years old, and something is different about him. He doesn't know it yet, but he's the son of a Greek God, and a very powerful God. However, everyone isn't so pleased to see him. Someone has stolen Zeus's Master Lighting bolt, and has framed Percy. He has little time to find out who stole the bolt and why, and also try to stop a war that's coming to Mt. Olympus.This is such a great read. If you have a child in 4th, 5th, or 6th grade, then this is a must read for them. They'll be hooked after the first Chapter!"
5,GREAT!,"This book is great! I would recommend this whole series, it's awesome. My cousin read some to me and I never knew I would like this kind of book."
5,"great, fast paced read",a few years ago i watched the movie that was released and i enjoyed the movie. i found out that there was a book for it so i picked it up for my kindle. i wont get to much into the details of the story as you can find those in other reviews but this book is definitely different from what most people would think the Olympian gods are like. The plot was very interesting as i personally enjoy Greek mythology and history. i would recomend this book to any child who knows at least a little information about greek mythology and to adults who have interests in greek mythology.
5,AWESOME!!!!!!,"I've read a ton of books, but this one is my all time favorite. From its funny chapter titles, hilarious moments, and origional topic, you're sure to love this book as much as i did."
5,Selina's Book Review,Title The lightning ThiefIn the middle percy mom and him were going to bloody house and a monster camean attact percy mom and she disapear. Percy was sad and mad that his momhad disapear . So he killed the monster because he had the monsters horn .I thinkthat the kids should read this book because it is interesting and sad. Read thebook to find out what happend at the END.genre fiction
5,Move over Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"Move over Diary of a Wimpy Kid. There's something else on your tail. This book kicks kids into reading all sorts of Greek myths. Every kid loves the hilarious chapter titles. Although mostly boys read the book, my friends and I are girls and we like it too. Even my mom read it. The obvious favorite part for everybody is when he battles Ares, but I also liked when he goes to Olympus and delivers the missing lightning bolt before the 10 days are up. The amazing details in the text helped many kids learn if they didn't know all the Greek gods names and meanings. My friends and I liked Percy, Anabeth, Grover, Chiron, and many other characters. Trust me, reading this book can help lots of people learn the Greek myths. I recommend this book for ages 7 to 107. If you like this book, I also recommend getting other mythology books to help you learn more about the Greek gods. So get the Lightening Thief today or you'll be sorry!"
4,Review,It was a good book. I enjoyed reading. I recommend this book. If you like the series you will love this book
3,Let me read and find out,Its perfection... if you let me read you'll have more from me but I can't read it right now thanks!
4,a must read,"i loved it! it was funny and interesting, and i really got into it even though the main character was 3 years younger than me. i only had two problems:1. a not nice word was used a few times. most people don't mind that word, but it bothered me.2. i didn't agree with the mom's final decision about the stepdad.as a christian, i know the ideas about greek gods aren't true, so as long as this book is taken as pure fantasy, i loved it."
2,Disappointed,"What else is there to say? A friend suggested it, saying it was ""the best book in the world"" but when I read it I thought that is was seriously over-rated. I say that it would be great for young readers, but if you are someone looking for a book that is interesting AS WELL AS logical, I say find a different book. But nice incorporation of Greek mythology. (By the way, does anybody else wonder if the movie isn't even based off this book at all? Did the producers even read it, or just base it off the cover?)"
4,Wonderful book for teen and adults alike,"I would've given this a 5 star but it wasn't as exciting as the books 2-5.To me it seemed like the prologue of the book the long version of it.Nonetheless,this book introduced me to the wonderfull world of YA books.I have been reading adult books for quite sometime and honestly it's been getting boring lately.If you are reading this book and couldn't get into it.Be patient and finish the first book then move along and read books 2-5.You won't regret it.Happy reading!"
4,Liked It a Lot,"When I first began to read this book, I was upset by the seeming ripoff of Harry Potter, particularly the part with two boys and one girl, the girl being much smarter than the boys. But as I continued to read, I became engaged in the story of Percy Jackson and saw that this was its own story, not an imitation. Perhaps the author was inspired by Harry Potter, but he has made this story his own. I liked the imagination at work here, delving into the Greek gods and their history, traits, and who/what each of them ruled over. It was fun watching the kids try to figure things out. There are enough strange happenings here and enough challenges to keep a reader very satisfied."
5,Read this book!,"I love the percy jackson series and every book in it. I have read the whole series three times this month and it never gets old. If you are not sure if you want to read this or not, you should definetly get it. It is the best series i have ever read."
2,Poor Word Choice+Poor Plot=Poor Story,Lightning Theif was not as good as my freinds made it out to be and it disapointed me. It was OK with OK imagination but I dont think I will read the next book.
5,Awesome,Really good.it is wonderfully wonderful and wow it was so good I couldn't put it down for more than thirty minute.
4,Fun read,I enjoyed the story. A fun and quick read. Not royalty seriios or dramatic but captured me enough to get the next book in the series.
1,PJATO,"I am sooo glad I got this book for free. Changing a character's name (and the names of his two best friends), the name of his school, making muggles mortals and selling rehashed stories as original ideas does not make you an author, Mr Riordan. I find it hard to believe that a supposedly reputable publishing company would allow this drivel to be available in bookstores. Save your money and just re-read the Harry Potter books since they're the same exact stories."
1,Overall disappointing,"I was somewhat captured - at first. I wanted to know more. But I could not (albeit I tried) get over the LACK OF: 1. originality, 2. good organization, 3. fluidity, and to top it all off - BAD sentence structure and repetitious style. I am left to wonder why the publishing company accepted this material."
1,Too simple!,"Has anyone else noticed how simple he's made Greek myths? And not just that, but how he's basically just rewritten them in more simplified, modern words, adding occasional references to iPods to make the book seem - pretentiously - relatable? We already know the story of Medusa, and the Titans (like a ca-gillion times), and Athena & Poseidon having a rivalry - WRITE SOMETHING NEW! Pretty amazing how he's gotten away with this!"
2,My rating is low and haven't read it yet. May increase after I Read it.,"I bought the kindle version, and the publisher has opted out of the text to speech function that the kindle offers. Unfortunately I bought all the books based on a friend's recommendation. I will probably really enjoy them. But there is no text to speech option. Thanks Hyperion Books a subsidiary of Disney. Disney is always at the leading edge of technology for people with disabilities. And I am getting really tired of companies taking that away from books so that they can sell the audio version for 25 bucks. Thanks for pilfering more money out from disabled people who have to pay for more expensive products that accomodate them."
1,omg,"i absolutely HATED this book. The writing looked like it had been written by a toddler the chapter names might of been been creative but a) they gave away the whole point of the chapter and are just stupid. Also Rick Riordan have a little sentiment i mean seriously, (my gut?)when some one dies or is hurt you dont say in my gut i knew they were severly hurt ....cant you say in my heart or something and finally he TOTALLY copied off of harry potter i mean a boy who has anger issues a side kick that is kinda slow and has red hair and a smart girl this is a really bad book.Iknow TON of people that hate it"
1,distinctively disjointed,"While I realize this was written for 9-12 years old children, I still feel that this was not a well rounded adventure story. I expect the film version to be disjointed and choppy trying to quickly cram as much scenes from the book in a possible. I do not expect the book to read like a disjointed script. There is little depth, warmth, or even amazingly entertaining action scenes. I do not feel the book was however a rip off of the Harry Potter series. It is just the tried and true children's fantasy adventure story formula. The Lightening thief does not even try wow the imagination but churns out a mythology mish mash that should be entertaining and fun but just falls short. The only thing I can recommend is the adoption of a dyslexic hero, something my nephew could enjoy, however though it claims that this problem is due to half blood demi-god status of Percy. hmm."
5,Great use of Greek Mythology,"My 6th grader read this for school. They had to keep a journal that included pointed questions, so she asked me to read it along with her. We read a chapter per day and I actually found myself wanting to read ahead. It's full of unique adventures and characters. Enough to take your imagination along for the ride without feeling like it's just too far fetched (even though it is). My daughter really enjoyed it as did most of the other kids in her class. I would definitely recommend it for tweens and also as a good book to read along with your child - book group style."
5,Awesome,This book kept you on the edge of your seat. It was a very interesting book that talked about gods and a long journey.
3,The Lightning Thief,"This would be a very good book for young teens. I enjoyed reading it, and it kept my interest. The language and content would be excellent for young people. As a retired teacher, I enjoy finding books that I would recommend for children of all ages."
5,THE LIGHTING THIEF,Persey Jakson is son of the sea.Persey has a step dad named Gabe he gambels and very selfish and he hits Perseys mom.HE is on a mission to save a thunder bolt. So he goes to the under world to hades.HIS mom like poofed away. SO he has two missions to save his mom and find the lightning bolt will find them.
5,Intriguing Literature!!! A must read!!!- Passion Writer 123,"In Rick Riordan's novel Lightening Theif he has set up a great combination of theology and mondern fiction. His main character Percy Jackson is a son of one of the three main gods. But he doesn't know it!Percy Jackson seems to be ""trouble magnet."" He has never truly fit in at any school or has never had enough time to fit in.Percy finds himself in terrible danger and with only one place to run to. Though he struggles, Percy makes it to a summer camp where all the kids of the gods' attend to gain safety from the underworld monsters they attract. But percy has been called on an almost impossible mission. He must leave the safety of camp, and return a sacred item to his uncle Zeus god of the sky! This incredible work of fantasy is a must read! I invite avid readers of all ages to pick up Lightening Theif!- it won't let you down. If you enjoy this novel pick up Sea of Monsters, the sequel."
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"A rare cookbook: simple, healthy recipes, tasty but not for gourmets. I also have Lund's book ""Cooking Healthy with a Food Processor,"" and both books share nutritional summaries for each recipe, valuable for Weight Watchers and Diabetics. Introductory chapters of a general nature are equally valuable. In this book Lund shows how to substitute low-fat, low-calorie ingredients for otherwise high-calorie ingredients, such as sour cream, sweet evaporated milk, cooking oil in recipes, and others. Great book for an old widower like me!"
3,Satisfactory,Seems to do a better job with some knives than others. It is easy to hold with elderly hands (smile). I recommend it for ease of use and comfortable to handle.The magnetic back makes it easy to keep close without cluttering the kitchen counter.
3,Sharpens okay but could be better,"The sharpener is easy to hold. Since my knives were completely dull I was able to see right away the difference in sharpness. It does seem to sharpen fine, but probably not as well as an electric sharpener. I like the fact that it is a magnet and attaches to the refrigerator. The blade 'lock' does not work well though. I would like for it to have more of a secure feeling when i am sharpening my knives. I am always afraid that the blade thing will slip when I am sharpening and that I could cut myself. But as far as the price and sharpening ability, it seems to get the job done."
1,sharpens but doesn't do a great job .,"This sharper is cool because it is a magnet that you can stick to the fridge for easy access. However it is not a good sharpener. It sharpens knives but not well. Also, it has a limited amount of use before it will go into the trash. Probably half a year and it will be useless. Spend your money elsewhere for something that sharpens better and will last you more than a year."
2,"Looks sharp, works dull.","Chicago Cutlery has been a good name over the years, but this sharpener does not live up to the quality of their knives. It might be fine if you already have a good edge, but if you are starting from a dull blade, you'll need an Accusharp sharpener. That's the one you'll see in the hands of chefs and butchers."
3,Not real impressed,"I had one before this that I liked better. This one seems to leave nicks in my knives. Hubby uses it, but I don't."
3,Keeps blades sharp,"This sharpener does a good job maintaining blade sharpness, it does not put the return the correct profile once lost."
1,Bad knife sharpener,"When i got this and tried it the for the first time out of the package it almost ruined my knife,after trying this product my knife was duller than before I used it, I will not use this ever again, I threw it in the trash cause thats all its good for."
1,P.O.S.,This is not a good sharpener. There is virtually no difference in the sharpness before and after use.It is a decently strong magnet though.
2,"Sharpener, Chicago Cutlery","This is not really a knife sharpner. It will not sharpen a dull knife. It is more of a stropping stone using a ceramic stone at the correct angle to hone the edge of a sharp knife. It does this well. I use it after each cutting with my sharp knife to keep the keen edge on it, for that it works well. It should be advertised as a hone and not a sharpner. I bought this for sharping my knifes and was very dissapointed. I had to buy a real sharpner, but this item is handy for keeping a keen edge on my already sharp knifes. I can not recommend this as a knife sharpner.PS: One last thing. This sharpner has one good thing it has a magnetic back which allows it to be stored on a metal refrigerator. Very handy for quick use."
1,MagnaSharp Mouse Knife Sharpener,I couldn't tell any difference in the degree of sharpness on the knives before use and after use..
1,Never could make my knives sharp--recommend Accu Sharp,"I have had this sharpener for several years. I never really was satisfied with it, though it may have made my knives a little sharper. But I do recommend: AccuSharp 001 Knife Sharpener. Wow. My knives get sharp with the AccuSharp."
1,This FAR/AIM misses the mark...,"Sorry to poo-poo someone's effort at publishing but this version of the FAR/AIM falls short of the competition on two accounts:1. The FARs ARE NOT UP TO DATE! Specifically, 91.167 (the 1-2-3 Rule), which is updated in the ASA *2001* version, has not been revised in this McGraw-Hill publication! Sadly, the McGraw-Hill website does not reflect a timely update, either. (It still references the 2001 edition.) I am concerned that there are other, more pressing changes that are not current.2. The AIM is only black-and-white, no color.Because of reason #1, I will be returning this book, and will order the FAA-issued FAR/AIM."
3,Hard!,"These were really quite hard for my teeth! I was hoping they were the texture of the fruit snacks which are also real fruit, but super soft and chewy, but not sticking to my teeth. These were chewy alright, but hard--think old licorice or JuJuBees that have sat out for a week. Were they tasty? Ok, but I couldn't really tell one flavor from another. Did I eat them when I was sitting at work and wanted chips or chocolate? Yes, they gave me something to chew. And chew. And chew. My kids ate them too, but they eat anything and are not very picky at all. I thought it was misleading when I saw the top three ingredients were corn syrup, sugar, and high fructose corn syrup. Then fruit purees and finally caranauba wax. Will not buy again."
1,Wait..... Don't Buy These They Are Fake!!!!!!,"Product was not as advertised. Did not arrive in truform package,they came in a panty hose package with a clear package and cardboard paper wrapped around the compression hose . My wife owns a pair of truform compression 20-30 that are medical grade and very stong material and the product I received looks very different from the one she has. These look and feel so thin and material looks more like a panty hose and the toe and heel are so thin they can rip easily as oppose to the real truform compression medical grade she owns . We truly belive these are not the real thing and cannot be returned because they don't come with a serial number or UPC #"
2,Slow moving non-classic,"This film used to run on TV on the weekends, so it naturally has a lot of nostalgic fans giving it high rating. Yes, it also sparked the Spanish horror movie era. Reality check: it's a slow moving horror film that just hasn't dated very well. It lacks the exploitation elements of later Naschy films (no nudity, mild violence) and the script is lackluster and the acting is too easy to dismiss. Naschy was inspired by the old Universal horror movies, but he really missed the mark. Universal horror films: classic. Hammer horror films: classic. '70s Spanish horror films: classic. This film: boring.If you're interested in Naschy's work, this should be towards the bottom of the list--check out some of BCI's releases first."
5,This book is soooooo good!,I read this book a while back (I NEED TO FIND IT)so I can reread it. This book's setting is also in an old time period. It starts off with a plot for revenge but turns into a love that was oh so sweet! There's alot of shock factors in this book but if you like romantic books with twists this is the one.
5,Patriotic Posters,I am teaching a class this fall on WWI and WWII. These posters will be an asset to the class as they depict the war effort in America at the time. Great product. Fast delivery.
1,What a Bore.,"I've read many Sinatra biographies and this is by far the least interesting and most pretentious. Michael Freedland's self-imporatnce oozes from within the lines; his claim that some of the stories are told here for the first time have no interesting payoff whatsoever for Sinatra fans. This is more like reading a book by Robin Leach and the ""Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous."" I think we need to ask the Brits to stick to their side of the Atlantic if they can't do any better than this."
2,Somewhat negative slant of Sinatra's extraordinary life.,"Michael Freedland's British background is too apparent for American readers. His English spellings are bothersome and frequent grammatic uses of ""were"" instead of ""was"" get in the way of what otherwise would be a facinating story of one of American music's top performers. The editors failed to catch misspellings of Tiajuana, Mexico. Freedland bashes Sinatra's parents unnecessarily and takes too much credit for ""publishing for the first time"" anncedotes that may be moderately interesting. This book comes across as an episode of ""Lives of the Rich and Famous"" with an English accent. Freedland collected notes over a period of years and the book often reads like a collection of them."
2,i.Sound Portable Speaker,I like that I am able to slide the speakers inside when I am not using it. I think it has decent sound. The reason I gave it 2 stars is b/c my ipod Nano does not fit in any of the stands provided.
3,Lil funkey huhu,James brown is a funky dude... over 3 records and 100 sales later he releases this... Get it if ur a fan cuz itll compllete ur collection
5,An excellent overview of the Colle System featuring two chapters on the Colle-Zukertort system,This is an excellent overview of the Colle system featuring illsutrative games with plenty of analysis and alternative moves. The book spends two chapters on the Colle-Zukertort System (which is not really the Colle System) where white fianchettos the dark squared Bishop. This system is excellent to play and very handy for Colle system players when they cannot play e5 and unleash the dark squared Bishop on the King side. This book is well complimented by Colle Plays the Colle System which features all 116 of Edgard Colle's games where he played the Colle System.
2,Not quite useful enough for the price,"Lane gives a lot of variations, but he does not give much explanation to guide the player. Furthermore, there is really no need to include both Colle systems in a book on The Colle.The Koltanowski system and the Zukertort system are so different, and likely to be useful to different players, that including both in a single book is like including the Najdorf AND Dragon in the same book.I recommend _A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire_ by Aaron Summerscale instead. If you absolutely canoot get that book, then Lane's may be worth getting depending on your needs. If you can get Summerscale's book, then Lane's book isn't worth getting for the vast majority of people."
3,Tricky opening- beware,"The Colle is a decent opening with some sting, but I have found that you can get into some serious trouble with this opening. With this opening, you can trick the average player, but when it comes down to playing the good players, you find yourself playing the same moves and you will get ""Smashed!"" Finally, it is a little expensive for the book, but if you can find a used copy, get it for reference."
2,Not well made,"The stethoscope and the little hammer and ear inspector are made okay, but the rest of the pieces are not durable at all. The syringe broke into several pieces within a week. I'm not even sure how the magnifying glass thing is supposed to be used - it doesn't sit on their heads and won't go around their neck. Go figure. The blue inserts for the carry case fell out right away and still had glue on it so we didn't even give the case to the girls to play with."
2,Not what I expected,My 4 yr. old son chose this on Amazon for himself. The pieces are not very durable and the blue plastic liner is hard to work with. A lot of pieces have come apart already. It is definitely not what we expected.
5,Jazz Legend,I bought this for my son-in-law for his birthday. He's a jazz pianist but had never heard of Mr. Flory. He reports that he's thoroughly enjoying listening to someone new.
2,School Boring Murders,"Yawn. I have read all of Leslie O'Kane's books and liked this the least. The characters were cardboard stereotypes, not at all believeable. Molly spends her time investigating the murder of a very unlikeable woman in order to clear her father's name. I wanted to scream when her clueless Dad insisted on taking the blame for crimes he didn't commit. I just couldn't get interested in the whole thing."
2,CD skips and is generally crappy,"Wondering why this cd was removed from itunes I bought it and realized why. It is the very definition of prosaic, it is not the work of a seasoned artist...there is maybe two halfway decent songs. Also, the cd skips through out..."
1,This CD is Boring.,"Mandy Moore has a beautiful voice, but her band is terrible. The music is just... boring. She needs a better band."
2,Extra ORDINARY,"I was so disappointed with this CD. I read somewhere that Mandy Moore had offered refunds to her fans for her first album. I wish she'd offer refunds for this one. It's not that it's necessarily bad, but just really boring and there's nothing special about it. It should be a soundtrack to a cheezy made for TV movie. She has such a great voice. I loved her Coverage album because it really shows off her voice. Every time I listen to this CD it's like the first time because none of the songs are memorable or leave any kind of impression. The music is pleasant, but nothing I would ever think, ""Oh--I really want to hear that song"" or be singing to myself later. Big disappoinment."
2,"Bland, Boring Mandy","I thought that this CD was supposed to shown how Mandy had matured as a artist, but instead I've been left sorely disappointed. The music overpowers her voice on most of the tracks and half the time I don't know what's she's saying. On the first track, she proclaims that she's ready to be ""extraordinary"" but obviously she's set the bar too high.I like Mandy Moore a lot, I think that she's a talented, attractive young woman but perhaps she should stick to acting."
5,One of thee best new releases out there,"through this very inspirational and heartfelt cd you can really be mandy, feel her emotions. its that good. i'm completely smitten by the song ""most of me"" i think its got soo much of her in it and that what songs these days should count for! bringing out true experiences. Your whole heart right there on the table. i am very proud of mandy and this album is as unique as her new music video! if you're a many moore fan you will NOT be disappointed in any way possible. i feel that i've grown even prouder of her than i ever thought i would. a fine album! ^^CAUTION!once you start listening....you cant help but keep on! hehehee"
4,A much better debut...,"Given her history as an actress as well as a performer, Mandy Moore clearly has long term plans, and this is a very good indication of things to come. Wild Hope abandons whatever remaining status she had as a teen pop star (an evanescent path at best) in favor of finding her own voice and joining the ranks of serious songwriters. While the album lacks any real gems (although I find the title track very engaging), it is hopefully just the beginning of this talented young woman's musical career. Measured on its own terms, it is a consistent and dulcet album, effusing personal comfort that easily makes up for the shortage of hooks. I believe Mandy is on the right track and fully expect her next album will deliver what Wild Hope promises."
4,Very impressed,"I am not a huge Mandy Moore fan, honestly just the sound of her voice used to annoy me. But thanks to broadband at work and a love for new music I gave her a quick listen. The cool thing is that I even played it again after I listened to it the first time. She finally found a sound that works for her. You can feel her in the lyrics, her voice sounds real (instead of like she's trying too hard to sound perfectly polished), and as a result you feel like you are really getting to know and love her. I hope she is very proud of this album, I love ""Extraordinary""...makes you feel very empowered"
5,Only CD released this year that I listen to!!!,I heard a few tracks before it was released and liked them so much that I purchased Wild Hope when it came out and I haven't taken it out of my cd player since then. It is a great album that deserves to be heard. I really don't understand why it's not selling well but hopefully the word gets out on how good it is. Give it a shot because you won't regret it!
4,Surprising,"I haven't been a huge fan of Mandy's in the past - a little too earnest for my taste - but this CD sounds less a vehicle for ""Mandy"" and more a collection of completely enjoyable songs. I've listened without wanting to skip any tracks, which almost never happens for me. Her voice and performance don't get in the way of the music. I can't wait to listen again, and look forward to future efforts."
5,Even Better Then I Expected,And I expected it to be good. I have even more respect for her now writing her own material. These songs seem so personal to her. There beautiful! I even love how her voice sounds on this album. I can't explain it but what she does with her voice on this album fits her. Get this album you won't regret it.
4,"quality, but not compatible.",Looks like a quality part. Doesn't however fit the 18v Milwaukee caulking gun I just purchased. Gonna try a jury rigged solt'n.
5,Good product and service,The watch was great and the service first rate. Buy from this company or person!
3,good watch but dead battery,"Saw some other people got this watch with dead battery before, very unlucky, I got the one with the battery only working for 10 days."
5,To my Heavenly Father I shall pray!,"This book has taught me, among, other things to pray like this:I am God's daughter/ son. I live in the joyous expectancy of the best. The best is yet to come. My God is good, and so are all His ways and all His plans for my life. I am living in His presence, not on my own. He guides me and directs me. He holds me by the right hand. I hear His Voice. He speaks to me. I am completely His. I keep my mind clear of all negatives, fear, and discord. My whole being is His own holy temple. Lord, I glorify you in my own body!Just to show you that it is all in how you read a book and by what spirit you are praying. To my heavenly Father I shall pray!"
1,Not the quality I expected from Tuffy's.,"Fell apart in less than one month of use by my dogs.Very disappointingWould not recommend it to anyone.I have bought other Tuffy's with no issue. This one is not a quality toy.UpdateAmazon replaced the toy. Thanks Amazon.However, they toy fell apart this time within 48 hours of use by the dogs.Now my dogs are not huge nor vicious. They are rat terriers and a toy shouldlast longer than one or two days.Advice - don't buy."
2,Destroyed in a day,"We originally bought a Tuffy's Ultimate Bone toy, which is durably made, but it was too big for our beagle so we thought we'd give the Junior Bone a try.The Junior Bone is an ""8"" on Tuffy's scale, but there's a big difference between its durability and the Ultimate Bone's ""9:"" Within minutes of getting the toy, she ripped the loop off the end and swallowed it, and a 1/2 hour later she's ripped open the stitching and is tearing it apart.I don't recommend this toy because of the durability issues; but even if held up, the squeaker takes quite a bit of force to activate, which makes it less appealing."
1,seems dangerous,"My 36 lb, 7 month old black lab mix unstuffed this toy after 30 minutes of playing. I let her keep playing with it for another half hour until I noticed that it was coming apart in long fibers. She tends to tear other soft toys apart but this is the first one that I've seen come apart like this and I threw it away.She ended up throwing up the next morning when she's never thrown up after swallowing dog toy bits. :("
5,REally good lock,Really great lock that is durable and easily installed. The flat strike plate and moving parts in the lock body make it better than locks with a post on the strike plate.
3,Ho hum,"Even after reading another review that stated that it felt a little cheap I was hoping for a bit more. It is very light even with batteries, which is a good thing for carrying around, but not for the ""feel"" of the product. The vertical shutter release uses the infrared remote sensor on the camera body which means the camera has to be set to the proper mode to use and it doesn't have a halfway stop for focusing and metering. It has been easier to just use the normal shutter release button. The extra grip area is a plus as well as the additional battery capabilities. I will continue to use it for those two features, but I was dissappointed in the vertical button."
2,looks cool and thats it.,"i too was seduced by the price and look of the thing (will I ever learn?). As a battery holder its fine. It looks cool and it gives extra weight which some may find useful. The vertical mode? Forget it. Please forget it. You have to switch between remote control and back again PLUS you cannot use any of the custom exposure progs such as AL and EL. since your right hand (specifically thumb and forefinger)cannot be in two places at the same time can it? You have enough to think about in fast shooting without all this carry on. Utterly useless, just a marketing ploy. But like i say, it makes your camera look rather swish to those not in the know, and it does extend battery life. Worth 50 or so quid? Up to you..."
2,Opteka Battery Grip,"This unit is fine for holding 2 camera batteries or 6 AA batteries, giving you a few power choices. But an external fiber optic cable needs to be in place when using the shutter release on the grip to send the signal from the battery grip to IR sensor of the camera. The delicate plastic tabs that connect the fiber cable to the camera's IR sensor broke within a couple of weeks, making the grip's shutter release useless (unless the cable is super-glued over the IR sensor of the camera). Since I broke these tiny pins off myself, it is not a warranty item.The unit was inexpensive and the seller was great to work with - I bought several other items from them since - but the quality of the grip is cheap and even at the low cost. If you want a vertical battery grip, your choices are few. On the positive side, the grip adds weight and mass to your camera and gives it a cool, bulky look. Before the cable flimsy connections broke off, the grip's shutter release worked great."
3,"Functional, but cheaply made","Hey it looks good. Going to be out for the day with the kids, and shooting off 4 or 8 gigs in RAW mode, great add this grip two batteries with out changing. When you have to change, you better have small fingers, because getting that door open is a real tricky thing. the vertical release is a nice option, but not usefull for using auto focus. It sitts rather wobbly in the camera itself, but i layered a 1mm piece of black laminate padding inbetween to snug it up nicely.Over all 3 out of 5 starts."
3,Transition Album,"This album shows Dispatch's transition from the acoustic band that they were on ""Silent Steeples"" to the rock band that they become on ""Four Day Trials"" and ""Who Are We Living For?"" It's clear that when they recorded ""Bang Bang"" there were not yet ready to make that leap. Brad Corrigan is nowhere near the drummer he is on the later albums and he's still learning the instrument on this album. Even though this ""Bang Bang"" doesn't match up musically with the CDs, it contains many of Dispatch's most popular and catchy tunes. Casual listeners will probably like this a lot, but the their other albums are a bit better."
4,Lovin it,"I absolutely LOVE dispatch and recommend this album to all. ""Bang Bang"" has some of the better known Dispatch tuines like ""the general"" and ""out loud"" but also rocks withsofter songs like ""small change"". ""mission"" and ""here we go"" are faster with great lyrics you can sing along to and are sure to get you going. i especially love to listen to this CD when im running or driving- it just has a great energy. This album would be 5 stars but i dislike track two, ""bats in the belfry"", its very skaa and doesnt sound like the rest of their work. If you like this album, also try ""silent steeples""."
5,Great music for when you're kickin it with your friends,"This is the first cd that I bought by Dispatch. After hearing their song ""The General"" on the radio, I couldn't stop myself from buying the album. Every song is full of outstanding lyrics and great acoustic guitar. There isn't a bad song on the album, and it's one of those cds that gets better with every listen. When I'm kicking it with my friends and we're sipping on some brew, Dispatch just gos along so nicely. Adults who actually appreciate good music even though it's not the old stuff that they used to listen to, will love dispatch. The lyrics are amazing, I'd recommend this album to anyone with any music taste whatsoever."
5,The best of Dispatch,"This CD is flawless. If you are a new listener to Dispatch, you'll find this to be the best introductory Dispatch CD. It will have you singing along within two days of listening. Some of the most original songwriting skills that I've heard in a long time. Original, excellent, flawless, perfect, awesome, happy. These are all words to describe 'Bang, Bang'. Some of my picks from this CD are: 'Two Coins', 'The General', 'Bats in the Belfry', and 'Out Loud'."
5,good,this upcoming band is great. Hopefully they will be able to make it big so we can hear more of what's behind their music.
5,great band!,"I love Jam rock. I love the energy and the idea of mixing different styles like jazz, blues, rock, reggae, and funk. The only problem i have with it is that sometimes the lyrics suffer. Bands like Phish and WSP are great, but their lyrics have no depth. You can only listen to tripped out drug references for so long.That's why I love dispatch. their music is fun yet there is some depth to the songs. The General, Two coins, and Out loud are just several glimpses into the bands good song writing. But the good thing is that they aren't too serious. The band still knows how to just plain jam. These guys are great musicians. This is a great albulm that is fun to listen to. They have a great style and great sense of what music should be. ROCK ON!!!"
2,Look Elsewhere,"I took a chance on this one based on its reviews and I am disappointed. Although it initially comes off as if they have something to say, there is no substance in the lyrics. The music is really not interesting either. If I was drunk in a college bar, I believe I'd think that these guys sound better than the average local band. But, if you really like the sit back and ""listen"" to a good album...look elsewhere."
2,A Dissenting View,"I took a chance on buying this CD, based on previous reviews (they were all so positive!). I was looking forward to hearing a great band, but I'd describe this band as . . . well . . . uninspired. They have nice harmonies, so I guess if you're really into that, you might think this is a great CD. In terms of production, the vocals are way up front. This is probably because there isn't much happening instrumentally. I wouldn't say the CD is BAD, exactly, but the musicianship isn't great, the lyrics don't make me pause, the band's not innovative . . . I could have this CD on and still read a book at the same time, and that doesn't speak well for the music."
1,Disbad,"I was curuious about this band after hearing their name around New England over and over again, so and I have to say, I was disappointed in almost every aspect of this record. The lyrics were silly and akward, when not self-important, and the music sounded like something that you'd hear blasting out of a Jeep Wrangler in a private high school parking lot. The songs are forgettable and the production is uninspired. The band seems to wander aimlessly from jam-bandy acoustic mush, tocute, message-devoid raggae, to rock that dosen't come close to rocking. If Dispatch wants to break into the mainstream they should pick a genre, committ to it and try to bring something to it. For those of you who like good independent acoustic music, try Badly Drawn Boy or Eliott Smith and leave this for the prep schoolers."
3,Whats so great,"Come on this guys are alright but theyre forgettable. Theyre music isnt spectacular. Theyre songs are ok, nothing so great. Will i remember this band 10 yrs from now, NO."
5,Dispatch is INSANE,"Not only do I DJ Professionally, but I run a music video countdown show called ""Countdown"" out of New England. First...they're album...I don't think there is a single questionably bad song on the album. Every song is filled with the most sincere energy, passion, and meaning I've ever heard before in my life. Second- With ""Countdown"", I had the pleasure of meeting them and filming a performance of thiers' in Boston, MA...seeing them live and meeting them only confirmed what I had known all along, They truly are musical geniuses.I first started listening to dispatch about two years ago....As many paople did, I discovered ""The General"" first. That song along was comparable to many of Dave Matthews' catchy and uplifting songs. The rest of ""Bang Bang"" is increadible as well. I truly think that Dispatch deserves more credit than they get, and I truly hope hope that they find it soon...I highly reccomend this album to anyone who could use some REAL music in thier life..."
5,An un-classifiable innovation in music,"There are no real words to describe the genre-bending that the three guys of Dispatch put together here. Beautiful music throughout, Bang Bang set the table for bands like Incubus to experiment with rythyms and texture. Braddigan, Pete and TChad all play and sing so well they commonly switched instruments during their shows. Now THAT'S musicianship. And you hear it on the album, with incredible percussion, guitar riffs, and three-way vocal harmonies that will amaze. The stylistic diversity heard here is rare indeed. From neo hip-hop in ""Here We Go"" to a sparse acoustic ballad (""Out Loud"") to a storytelling jam (""The General""), straight up rock (""Railway"") to a funky congo-driven romp (""Whirlwind""). The lyricism is as excellent as you'd expect from three former singer-songwriters. Dispatch is also novel in their Do It Yourself approach to the music biz. Luckily, the lack of major label support did not prevent the making of this must-own, classic album."
5,Great album for first-time Dispatch listeners,"I was recommended Dispatch by a friend and I am now addicted to this funk/reggae sound. This album contains slow and quicker songs, but all have a rhythmic harmony that is intoxicating. Their sound is like nothing I've ever heard before. It's completely different. They use acoustic guitars, harmonicas, and a wide variety of drums. The opening song is great, it lures you in and then you'll find out that it only gets better. My favorite tracks are ""Mission,"" ""Here We Go,"" ""Bats in the Belfry"", and ""The General."" The instrumentals in the beginning of ""The General"" are incredible, but ""Two Coins"" is also impressive; it's one of their mellower songs. You'll probably enjoy Dispatch if you like OAR or Guster, although they don't sound that much alike. It's all jam rock in the end, but Dispatch ultimately plays at their own level."
5,Dispatch is great,Dispatch is an impressive musical force. The music has a southern flavor that is not too tired like alot of music out there. The General is a great song with nice lyrics and an amazing introduction. Check this CD out for sure.
3,Beautiful and affordable,Beautiful and elegant for lady to wear.Resonable price.It would be perfect if the watch was driven by solar energy of self-wind.But I do not understand why the product is Amazon warranty but not factory warranty.
4,Fun action flick.,"This was a fun movie to watch. It's obviously not a work of art, but it had lots of action, good effects, likable characters, stunning visuals, and some good humor. It was also a pretty clean movie, which is always nice as a lot of movies nowadays are too sexual, gory, or crude to watch with the family. If you consider yourself a film connoisseur, you'll probably hate it. If you like fun adventure movies that aren't too serious (i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars), you should enjoy this film.Oh, and the blu-ray transfer is awesome! Best way to watch movies at home!"
5,Fun!,"Having played the video game I was pleasantly surprised at the similarities between the two. The movie is a lot of fun to watch. Keep in mind, it is a Disney flick so if tend to dislike Disney you probably wont like this."
4,One of the better video game adaptations out there.,"This movie may not be perfect, but it's still got a lot of charm and some amazing visuals-- for 2 hours, your HDTV will be transformed into a glittering chest full of golden treasure. It's a fun adventure romp set in the ancient world, and although it may rely on some overused tropes to get the job done, it's still an enjoyable Indiana Jones-style ride that will take you to some pretty amazing places. I'm a big fan of the game it's based on, and even though it's only minimally accurate, I can at least understand the changes they made (although I don't think it would have killed them to at least call the princess ""Farah"" and put her city in India). If you go into it with an open mind and knowing that the story is not a game changer, what you'll find is big adventure draped in lavish, exotic visuals."
4,Great,"I have seen this movie several times and finally decided to buy my own copy. Not thought provoking or educational, just good fun. I really like it"
4,"One of the best ""Based on a Video game"" movies I've ever seen","This movie is one of the best movies based on a video game that I've seen, and as a gamer, I've seen a lot of them. Definitely a movie worth watching!"
5,Your kidding,"1st its a disney thing so of course it looks great,and has great fx.Not only was the story lame,but I found it hard to watch some dude who a few months ago who was playing hide the sausage on a P.O.S.Bowedback Mountain,and now they try to man him up?"
4,The Best Video Game Adaption!,"Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) must clear his name when the King who treated him like a son is murdered by a gift he gave him. While his uncle Nizam, (Ben Kingsley) will stop at nothing to get his hands on a very special time turning dagger that's in Dastan's possession. At Dastan's side is Tamina (Gemma Arterton), the protector of the dagger.Prince of Persia is a fun guilty pleasure type of film like the Mummy, except I think it's better. The Mummy probably has better effects though. The CGI is the weak point of Prince of Persia, you always know when you're looking at a CGI version of Gyllenhaal for instance. Still, I think the movie is better than a lot of the disappointing 2010 summer releases and also much better than all of the other video game adaptions so far."
4,Fun Film,"Prince of Persia was a fun and entertaining film. Highlight ENTERTAINING. It's not ground breaking, not though invoking, won't improve my self worth, influence me to change my religious beliefs or to hug my dog, kid and husband. What it did was entertain me. Isn't that the main purpose for most movies, especially summer blockbusters? Here is hoping for a sequel. Oh and SHAME on the person who called Gemma CHUBBY! What is wrong with you? Just because she is not a size 0 -2? You are the reason so many young girls become anorexic, to please narrow minded individuals like yourself."
3,"Very good visuals, fair acting","Definitely geared toward the teenager set. Very good visuals, cg, scenery, and costuming. Mediocre on acting and script. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it is spite of its faults. Probably a strong 3.5 for me."
5,Prince of Persia,"This item was received in a timely fashion & it was a gift to one of my sons. And I've heard no complaints, in fact a few minutes after he opened it he watched it.Janette Todd"
3,Falls short of the game,"When i started watching this movie, I was excited to see a familiar scene as from the video game that I have been playing. Unfortunately, The movie fell short in my opinion. The action scenes were entertaining, and fun to watch, but the overall comparison between movie and game were not there."
2,Not Jake Gyllenhaal's Best Moment,"I recently watched this movie on the plane, was surprised that I thought it sucked even as a plane movie, decided I was going to write a review panning it, and then completely forgot I had watched it the moment I landed. I kept on racking my brain, trying to think of the movie I had watched on the plane, quite amazed that two hours of my life had just disappeared like that. I kept on pushing myself to remember, and I couldn't do it. It was only when I was randomly trolling the Amazon pages did I see the ""Prince of Persia"" DVD, and remembered that I had watched it on the plane.Anyway, that's all I really wanted to say. Oh, and the movie sucked. And one last thing: I watched it because Jake Gyllenhaal was in it, and I thought that a man so talented (he really was good in ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Jarhead"") could compensate for just about anything. But I was wrong. (Okay, I lied -- I only watched it because I was on a 13-hour flight.)"
3,Family Flick,It's not a mind blowing moving but at the same time it's something that you can enjoy with your kids and have a nice family time.
4,Fun for all,"Prince of Persia takes you on a wild ride through history and back. The lush scenery, exciting action, and eye candy galore appeal to women, children, and men alike. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep viewers engaged. Perhaps there will be a sequel? Definitely worth buying on Blu-Ray."
3,"Insufferable fake accents, dumb plot","This Disney throwback to an earlier epic film era is plagued with ridiculous fake pompous British accents by everyone in the cast. No one in the time of this Middle Ages movie, set in what is today modern day Iraq, would have been speaking English, much less with a fake Brit accent. The whole thing carries on too long. The plot is a family drama, which combines elements of the Lord of the Rings with 1950s B-movie fantasy. There's plenty of brief comic relief, mostly when certain of the characters sort of step out of character for a second or two to indulge in some post-modern banter which is also out of place. Jake Gyllenhaal looks ridiculous all pumped up, and the plumped up baby lips of the leading lady drove me to distraction. Not much entertainment here for thinking adults with at least some higher education."
5,Very pleasantly surprised when saw this movie the first time.,"I remember the very 1st time watching this movie, it was so entertaining that I said ""this is a must own movie"". Movie is nice, clean, fun, beautifully made and thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommend."
2,popcorn,"Big budget, big stars, big action. Big snore. Not really invested in characters or plot. Rented through Netflix so not mad 'bout wasting my money. But would not recommend to anybody."
4,Enjoyable,"Our teen-age daughter really liked this one and watched it several times, and the parents thought it was pretty good."
4,SOLID COSTUMER! ENTERTAINING FROM BEGINNING TO END!,"Reminiscent of Ray Harryhausen's 'Golden Voyage of Sinbad' without the mythical monsters, 'Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time' delivers the goods where so many of these silly costume adventures fail. A nice mix of good vs. evil story and some exciting parkour action sequences make this film very exhilarating and entertaining. I found it humorous that Ben Kingsley appropriately played a homage to Torin Thatcher who played the sorcerer in another Harryhausen classic 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad' and the inspired rip off 'Jack the Giant Killer'.Jake Gyllenhaal aptly plays the hero and all supporting characters fit as well including a colorful role for Alfred Molina. Even if you don't usually like these types of films, this one is an easy and fun ride. Recommended to all costume adventure or Harryhausen film fans. Even though there are none of Harryhausen's creatures, this one surely has his heart."
2,"Great production values, weak screenplay",Beautifully photographed. Great special effects. Story is boring. About half way through I just stopped watching.
2,persian disapointment,"Even though some of the action scenes were good,the special effects with the dagger were a bit of a letdown"
4,"Buena Película, Falla con Digital Copy","Estoy muy satisfecho con la película, mis únicos puntos en contra son que el DVD no se puede reproducir en mi PC y la Copia Digital de nada me sirve ya que solo funciona dentro de los EEUU, yo soy de Perú así que ""no tengo derecho"" para poder verla en mi PC, felizmente que cuento con mi PS3 para poder disfrutar el material."
2,dissappointing even for light entertainment,"Like many newer movies, such as the remake of the Time Machine and War of the Worlds, the story here takes a back seat to the well done special effects and spectacular fight scenes. The chemistry between the primary characters was a key missfire for me lacking the depth and sparkle of ""The Mummy"" - which puts this in an exact perspective - this movie was like watching a poorly done sequel to the Mummy movies - without either Brendan Fraser or Rachel Weiss present. I have greatly appreciated Jake Gyllenhaal in other efforts, but he was wasted here, and all of the silly outfits and god awful hair did nothing to help. Gamaal's performance reminded me of the acting depth of an early Bond girl. This movie was so dull I fell asleep before it was over...and I may never be bored enough to watch it again to see the ending. I could have had more fun if I'd thrown the $16.00 out the car window. Sorry - but that's my opinion."
2,Ain't no Indiana Jones!,"After reading the glowing reviews listed here, I was anxious to see this exciting movie.....and boy was I glad I borrowed it instead of buying it! Acting was barely adequate (sorry Jake), story line was predictable as H-ll, attempted ""tongue and cheek"" humor was lame, and the action was choppy and hardly ""edge of your seat"". Rent it, or borrow a copy, or wait for it to come on Cable. You really won't want to watch it more than once. In fact you might not even want to bother watching all of it. Ending was totally predictable. And ostrich races?? Disney are you trying to cash in on the success of Swiss Family Robinson?? Well, it didn't work."
5,Came before time love it,came before time good service end good value thank youwe think it is a grate move we are wayting to wach it
3,Fun Afternoon,Hi: EveryoneThis movie is a reminder of Disney films of the past. This movie has a quality story with quality production. It is a fun and adventurous film with non stop action! This great for Children and Adults a like. This film's only fault is being a little too short. I like the film to take me threw the whole story and finish it. It seems now a days with the continuations that writers are finding themselves be demanded to write a possible opening for sequel at the end of every film. This is nice but make sure the original film is long enough!Anyway this is a good film and as always with Disney very child proof. But parents you should always look in just to make sure.
3,A fun film!,"This was a fun film to watch but little more. Shallow plot, charming characters, a happy ending, and lots and lots, and lots of action. I've wasted more time in a much less pleasant manner; worth seeing, once."
5,great service,"The blu-ray arrived sooner then expected, it was sealed and had no damage. I definitely would purchase from them again. Fun movie to watch it had a lot of action"
1,One of 2010's Worst,"Despite my distaste for Jerry Bruckheimer, I actually didn't think this film looked too bad. I like Jake Gyllenhaal and I knew he had the acting chops to bring this epic video game adaptation to life. However, I'm not sure what Gyllenhaal was doing during this movie, but it certainly wasn't acting. Both him and Gemma Arterton failed to unite any sparks to carry the movie through the dull patches (and believe me, there are lots of those), and Ben Kingsley plays one of the most unconvincing villains I have seen in awhile. To me, this film seemed like the ""Pirates of the Carribbean"" films, but without the wit or charm of Johnny Depp's immortal Captain Jack Sparrow. If you ever wondered what it would be like if ""Pirates"" didn't have Depp to stir things up between the lifeless relationship between dull Will Turner and boring Elizabeth Swan, see ""Prince of Persia"" and you'll see it for what it is: Pure torture.See complete review at:[...]"
1,What Were These People Thinking???,"What in the hell were these guys thinking when they came up with the idea to do a movie about the Persian Empire? These morons want to make this movie and release it in 2010 America, where Muslims killed thousands of Americans. And the makers and backers of this movie wonder why it disappeared quickly after opening day? You can be pissed off at what I am writing but would you have invested money in this movie that deals with a controversial civilization?"
4,Prince of Persia,"This movie was a lot better than I thought it would be, I enjoyed the performances by Jake Gyllenhaal & Ben Kingsly"
4,Good excapist entertainment,"An orphan boy is adopted by a King, and as a grown man is later implicated in the King's murder. He teams with a beautiful princess, with whom he seeks to clear his name while keeping a dagger with mystical powers out of the hands of those who would use it for evil means. This effects-laden film is satisfying due to the chemistry between the two leads and a story line that is coherent and engaging."
3,Waiting,"Well, this movie is pretty good not great. It could've been a lot better. It would be one to own if the price was fair.I will buy it when the price drops,,,drops way down. I'm sick and tired of big companies charging crazy prices they keep going up. Even in a good econemy these prices are wrong. It seems the worse the econemy gets the more they raise the prices. Well that won't work on everyone. If and when this movie is sold at a fair and reasonable price I'll buy it.That's how I feel about all DVD prices. Very few movies nowdays are worth 27.00 to 30.00 and then that's still pretty steep prices."
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen!,Only a few movies are this entertaining.It didn't take much acting to top Jakes previous movies. AWESOME!I bought the Blue ray/dvd/digital copy. These deals work great when you have blue ray in the master sweet and dvd in the living room. Digital copy for kids? haha
2,Another lame Hollywood attempt at historical epics,"I'd love a historical epic set in ancient Persia. Unfortunately,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Timeis just the latest Hollywoodized action nonsense aimed at teenagers. Far from being epic, Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton come across as a bunch of flirty teens, not as a prince and princess. The action scenes are way overdone, with Gyllenhaal's character pulling off some impossible moves. In between the action, there's almost no character development. Perhaps worst of all, even though ancient Persia should be a cinematographer's dream because of the potential for beautiful locales, the sets were pretty boring. The supposed mystical temple was located on top of a grassy knoll. Where are the rolling desserts ofLawrence of Arabia? There sadly haven't been many good historical epics sinceGladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray], and it looks like we'll have to wait a while longer."
5,Prince of Persia,I love this movie. Jake Gyllenhal is very easy to look at. This is a fantasy adventure that is fun to watch.
2,"Knock off of ""Pirates""","Here's an idea, lets take ancient persia, and white-wash the hell out of it.The story is formulaic and cheesy, and a direct rip off from Pirates of the Caribbean. Throw in some swashbuckling adventure, with an over the top outrageous main character, mix in the typical buffoon for comic relief (because you know, this story is so deep,) and then add OSTRICH RACING into the mix and you have this very bad movie. Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor, but even he can't save this atrociously bad script.If you are over the age of a 12, and have an IQ higher than 80, then you will not like this film. Skip it."
2,prince of brokeback mountain,"I didn't care for the movie. I never played the game on the PS2 but I know it was very popular. I guess if you're a fan of something like kingdom of heaven or hidalgo you'd probably like this, but for me it was quite boring. I'd rather waste two hours on ostrich races. Interesting a disney movie actually focused on her cleavage in one scene. 2 stars- Cant recommend it sorry, you may feel different... echo that through the ages."
1,A Good Story Ruined.,"The Original Story from the 2003 Game I thought was awesome, along with Warrior Within and The Two Thrones,But this stupid movie proves how much Disney and Bruckheimer fail at movies just like Pirates of the Carribean.This movie has NOTHING to do with the real Prince of Persia,they made the worst story for this film, and i'm surprised that a film that took over 2 years to make would have basically no thought put into it. They should've stuck to the original plot from the game.Im never gonna watch anything ever again directed by Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer."
5,"A Job Site ""must have""","If you plug more than one thing into an extension cord - you must have this - period. If you tie cords together in a knot so they won't come apart when you drag them around - you must have this.The photo should show how you loop the extension cord and the tool cord through the ""cord locks"" but since it doesn't, take my word for it - it works great! Go ahead and get two so you'll have a spare when someone steals the first one!"
3,"Excellent design, but not durable","I've owned one of these for several years. Initially, and for long after, it functioned very well. The ""trap door"" gates which keep cords from being accidentally pulled out of the sockets are a clever and elegant solution. But there is a problem. The plastic of which mine was molded become somewhat brittle over time -- not a problem on the whole, but it caused the arches of the pull-out protectors to break, both within a couple of weeks of each other. I have used this gang outlet around my woodworking shop and on outdoor remodeling and construction projects where I need to have several tools plugged in at the same time. I don't consider it to have been abused, but it has been well used. In fact, I'm using it still. But now I have to be sure not to put any undue strain on the corded tools I plug into it.Don't let this issue stop you from purchasing one. It's still a great design, and I'm ordering another for the times when I need it's cord-securing capabilities."
5,For the shadetree mechanic/carpenter,"Sadly I don't have a workshop and must do all of my carpentry work on my deck. This means that much of my time is spend with setup, and all of my equipment is portable. Adding to the problem, I have only one outside outlet. Time wasted has been cut down significantly because of this product.I can plug my table saw, skill saw, sander and any other power tools in to this same adapter, and the other end to my extension cord. This cuts down greatly on time spent in between tool use, and allows me to move off my deck...saving it from damage. As since only one tool is used at a time, there's no threat of drawing to much electricity through the single out let. A great time saver and a must have for the shade-tree mechanic/carpenter.For more information, [...]"
5,Happy with this purchase,Quality adapter for the right price. Can't ask for more than that. It is rugged and easy to use and I won't hesitate to buy more when needed.
4,better than I expected,"Purchased this for the purpose of putting them in a new *castle* doll house for my daughter this Christmas (she is 3), They will fit perfectly and I imagine will get a lot of use."
4,Happy with the purchase,Very nice figurines. They looked beautiful on the cake I made for my daughters birthday and she has enjoyed playing with them since. Kinda pricey but durable.
3,Wonders and Magic for both parents and kids,I actually still have this book from when I was a child. My mother bought it when I was only a year old. It has now been twenty years and I am still finding myself reading this book from time to time. I am now starting to think about raising a family and I look back at this book and I think all the stories are great. However some can be a little scary for really young children. The case in point I know of is the Story of the Minotaur. It is not a happy ending story and will no doubt keep kids up if they are impressionable. My personal favorites to this day are Nail Soup and the Nightingale. They all have great morals and are as much fun to read as they are to hear.
3,Not bad for the price,"This board was much more flimsy than I expected. I've purchased plain wipe-off boards in the past and they were always very sturdy and solid, and I had expected that of this board too. It tends to bend a little too easily and doesn't hang as flat against the wall as I would have liked. But, the magnets stick to it well, and it was the best price for the size out of the boards I looked at."
4,Social Nerdom,Before buying the DnD adventures we get them from the internet and check them out first. Bought the real book to replace the printed out version since we're using it. Only disappointment is that it would be better in hardback instead of paperback. We're playing 3.5 and even though this is 3.0 it still works fine except that the reference page numbers are off by a page or two sometimes.
4,"Not What I expected, but ALMOST as good","I bought this adventure hoping for maps and info on Menzoberranzan, as in all the novels I've read, it was referred to as the City of the Spider Queen, City of Spiders, whatever. Instead it's about Myrmidea or whatever, a city I'd never heard of, and I've read 3 of the 6 War of the Spider Queen novels. However, it IS an excellent adventure, from what I've read in it, and, having bought it for a VERY good price, I got my moneys worth and then some."
4,A gratifying musical experience,"When I first heard about Longwave I built up a rather extraordinary expectation of what they might sound like. Upon receiving the album I was confused and not particularly happy with my purchase. Later that night I decided to give it another listen while riding my bike home from work. Not only did my opinion of the music change but my expectations of the band had disappeared and were replaced with a non-judgemental approach to their work (somethimes you just have to allow the music to speak to you). I found (and still find) great lyrics and great music. Some of the concepts that are being used are brilliant and thought provoking in a reflective, life-affirming way. I look forward to more in the future from Longwave"
5,Sebago Men's Schooner Shoe,This boat show fits well and has a good tread for reducing slipping. Workmanship and overall quality is excellent. Note: The leather shoe laces need a granny knot or figure 8 knot to stay tied.
2,like walking on air*........air*=glass,Only saving grace for these shoes is how sharp they look. They are horribly uncomfortable and blistering. I own similar sperry's and never once had a similar issue.I strongly reccomend you buy sperry's instead
5,Quality shoe,I have been wearing these shoes for many years and they are great for quality and comfort. I'll be ordering another pair shortly.
5,Solid dependable shoes,"These are classically styled shoes. I had a pair exactly like these and have worn them nearly every day for the past 4 years. They still look good. After 4 years of use, the insole has come loose and the tread is worn down, but these are pretty fantastic shoes.I recently purcased another pair, these from Amazon, and I imagine they'll last several more years of heavy use."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!,"Ordered the shoes wore them once, the seam ripped open. Called customer service at the company and they sent the wrong size to me. I was leaving for a vacation 2 days later. Spoke with the owner and he begged mne not to write a bad review on the company because it would hurt their business! I said ""SORRY!"" I believe consumers need to know a poor operation and company when there is one. Nice person but a bad business and equally poor quality merchandise."
5,Boat Shoes for Casual Wear,"I bought these shoes for my husband. He has a wide foot and has a hard time finding shoes to fit. He got these, tried them on and just loves them. The shoe is as depicted in the picture, was true to size and has a nice casual look."
4,Nice shoes,"The product arrived on time, and as described. Other reviews warned about the shoe running a little small, so I ordered one size larger than normal. They fit well! I had a pair of Rockports for several years, but decided to try a different brand this time. No regrets. They are comfortable and look good."
2,Original Quality is Gone,"I am a professional sailor who goes through deck shoes like accountants go through batteries in their calculators. I have worn many pairs of Sebago and thought they were the best quality and fit. I haven't worn for a couple years because you don't see them often in stores. I just purchased two different pairs (both exactly like previous pairs) and the quality that was worth paying more for is no longer there. I have read that they are now manufactured in China, as they were manufactured in Maine. To bad...I won't be purchasing Sebagos anymore."
1,"beautiful shoes, but the soles wear out","The soles of these shoes are very thin straight out of the box. Made of rubber, they wear fast at the balls of the feet. After a few months, as I walked over gravel, I could feel many small rocks. Also, there is no interior padding at the ball of the foot. Having said that, they are beautiful, perhaps the most beautiful of all the boat shoes. I wish that they had lasted longer."
2,Schooner boat shoes. Supposedly wide.,"The quality is good, but the cut of the shoe is much narrower in front than other Sebago boat models. I had to return these."
5,Outstanding!,Great quality shoes and comfortable. Also at a great price. First time for Sebagos -- usually a Sperry fan. I would buy these again.
2,The Devil's Breed,"This poorly written, poorly construed mass market paperback is kind of historical fiction and mostly garbage. The story is set in Scotland and covers the Glencannon clan of Scots who fought on the losing end of the Jacobite reellion under Bonnie Prince Charlie. The characters are weak and the plot centers around lust. All in all it is a rather stupid book that really never should have found a publisher."
2,Not a tarot deck!,"This ""Mantegna Tarot"" deck is not a tarot deck at all! It is a collection of fifty allegorical representations of things like the Platonic virtues: Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, Prudence, but it does not include traditional major arcana figures like The Hanged Man. It also lacks a Minor Arcana. I have been unable to find any books or instructions on how to use this deck for divination. It has lovely Renaissance illustrations of allegorical figures, but as a tarot deck it is useless to me. I suppose one could create a way to use them for divination, but all the tarot books available are of no use for this deck. If you want a Renaissance tarot deck that can be used for divination--I would recommend the Visconti-Sforza deck instead of this. I think this would be strictly for collectors who want to see archetypal images of the Renaissance."
3,Davy Crockett as a child,"This book is written for a young adult. It is rather slow reading and there are some statements which I am not sure would actually apply to an independent frontier youngster. For example: A frontier boy crying?? I think that he might do so in private, but not even a 1950's boy would do so before anyone else. He would be considered a ""sissy"" something no boy wants. During those days it was common to keep your thoughts hidden. Otherwise it is an OK book for a young boy."
5,Very Durable,"Yes it delivers great coffee. Yes It is easy to clean, but I am really impressed with its long lasting durability.I've owned mine for two years. Used it almost everyday. It has never failed me.If you are sick of those fragile pretty presses, I would seriously recommend this one."
4,"Nice mug, french press is the best tasting coffee","Have been using this mug for a couple of months. It works very well and looks good. It's great for drinking a cup on the way to work and then making a second cup later with fresh grounds stored in the container in the bottom of the mug. It could be a problem for klutzes- the handle of the mug seems to be nearly as heavy as the mug, which can make it prone to tipping if bumped when there's not much coffee inside. After a few weeks of use in the car cup holder, there were some scratches in the finish. Overall, it is a solid mug that makes great coffee."
4,very useful,"I love the idea of the product but find it will not empty well, seems like there is a vapor lock. It has a nice toggle top that allows you to switch it to pour/drink that has a vent hole but when I think I have drained it, when I pull it apart there is still liquid in the cup. Love the storage for another cup of coffee."
3,Good cup but have a towel ready,"Just as all the other reviews here mentioned. The cup makes good coffee. I like the coffee holder at the base of the cup.For a portable traveling cup; the design needs some improvement. The cup is top heavy as the bottom is narrower. Probably to fit in most cup holders. I suspect, most cup holders are bigger than what the base really is. We are in the states after all, please super size my coffee mug's bottom for 50 cents more. I have already spilled this thing in my car and table a couple of times. I could be the only one that is this clumsy."
3,Great idea but poor heat retention :(,"I like to enjoy my coffee slowly...this product will retain heat for about 5-10 minutes - not long enough in my opinion. However, I do like the design and idea of single press coffee. Maybe adding a sleeve may help hold the hotness longer."
2,Falls short,"The two most important things an insulated coffee mug should do is, keep the liquid hot for more than 30 minutes, and not spill out of the closed lid when jostled around in a car. Unfortunately, this mug fails on both counts. It looks good, is well made, and the ability to carry coffee grounds for another cup of coffee is very useful; however, it just doesn't keep the coffee hot for more than half an hour. If you gulp down your coffee, then I suppose this would not be a problem. I like to take my time.I used a Bodum Stainless Steel French press mug for a couple of years and it performed extremely well. It survived falling off of the roof of my car twice and still does it's job pretty well. I wanted to buy another but they do not seem to be available. I thought I'd try a different brand but now I wish I had just kept my money.Perfect the lid and work on extending the time the beverage stays hot, then you might have something here."
1,Great design but POOR Quality,"I was so excited to finally get a french press mug and generally love the design. Unfortunately the handle fell off after only 6 weeks and the mug has always leaked a bit when you first put hot water in it. I have contacted Planetary Design to see if they would replace it, but I have not heard back from them. Overall the poor quality and lack of warranty support do not make this mug worth $30! Pretty disappointing."
1,Dribble Glass? It could happen.,"Perhaps I got a dud, but the seal on the plunger mechanism is not tight. When I try to drink from the unit, drops of coffee leak out of the seal and go on my shirt. I am retuning mine and MAY try another one.UPDATE: The problem was a blemish or slightly raised spot on the inside rim of the cup (not properly finished). It prevented the ""O"" ring from sealing. The replacement is fine. LOOK at the inside of the rim if you can! Incidentally, the manufacturer never responded to my e-mail. Happily, I purchased one with a logo from a local franchise coffee shop and they replaced it. So I will leave my rating at one star for the lack of customer service from the manufacturer."
2,cold hearted,"company never communicated with me,when I emailed them with a problem.Coffee gets cold fast because there is no insulation and it will spill very easily because it has on open top with no cover to make it spill proof."
2,"Great Idea, Fair Execution","I love the idea of a french press to go. However, the mug began to rust the first time I washed it. Also, there is no insulation at the rim, so the stainless steel is too hot to drink from until the coffee is too cold to enjoy. I was very disappointed in this very expensive product."
3,Blah,"My daughter only plays with this toy if I basically sit and make her play with it. It's really boring. I thought she would like the animal part to it, but it really holds no interest. Save your money and buy a different stacking toy."
1,Waste of money,"My baby has no interest in this toy, just pulls the heads off and cruises right by it. If I pull off the links to get him interested he doesn't play with them, but just grabs the base, turns it upside down, and tries to stand on it. It's pretty mashed up."
1,Chaplin should have read Chapman,Mr. Chaplin has succeeded in pouring salty water into healing wounds
4,The Ultimate Horror,"I feel very sad for Mr. Chaplin. His is the greatest loss of all; the loss of his life's partner who literally slipped through his fingertips. Had he been alone, he would have been heralded for his bravery and strength in surviving a dreadful storm at sea. Had he and Susan survived, they would have been heroes together. Instead, the reader will always wonder if he had done enough, which is not fair to him in the least. I admire the apparent detachment with which Mr. Chaplin describes the successes as well as the failures of their adventure. I learned, once again, the value of humility from this book, and appreciate the author's willingness to write a ""confessional"" in the face of so much pain and anguish. Peace and Best wishes to Mr. Chaplin and the many family members who were so affected by Ms. Atkinson's death."
3,FLAWED BUT ENGROSSING,"My initial thoughts upon completing this short book is that the author comes off as very unlikeable, as does his deceased partner. And I'm not sure if it's because the writing fails or because they truly are indeed selfish, unlikeable people. The main premise of having a loved-one slip right through your fingers to his/her death is strong enough to overcome most literary deficiencies and this is no exception. Despite the fact that it's not particularly well-written and the characters aren't likeable, I couldn't put it down. Go figure!"
3,Personal and poignant,"I couldn't put it down. I've (almost) been there and done that. Now I'm glad an appointment intervened. I related to Susan's behavior because I've seen Gordon's. Quick, easy reading. Not great literature, but something to make you think about your own perspective of life on the water."
3,A self-serving effort in an attempt to appease guilt.,"Mr. Chaplin clearly thinks far too much of himself. He speaks too often of sexual exploits while married or involved in a long term relationship. How does this apply to a story of a ship wreck?Throughout the book, this man acknowledged time and time again how he chose not to listen to his partners needs, concerns or fears -- instead pushing further into a situation that ultimately caused a life.Half way through the strory I found myself exhausted and looking forward to the end.A positive? Interesting travels to obscure locales."
2,"Emotionless, self-indulgent memoir by a mediocre writer.","Shame on Atlantic Montly Press for publishing this clearly self-indulgent memoir. Readers love an adventure story, so it was bound to sell no matter how ugly the tale, how ugly the man and how poorly written the piece. Chaplin suffers from the plague of late 20th century man: self-absorption. It appears at every turn of this story and at every turn in the prose. His utter disregard for his partner is horrifying. His lack of emotion in re-telling the story is unforgivable. His need to write the story is, perhaps, understandable, but his need to publish it is selfish and pathetic. It shows me he didn't learn anything about living from the death of the woman he loved.As a writer, he barely hits mediocre. I would never seek out any more of his work. As a man he's darn close to unredeemable.Do not buy this book. If you must read it, check it out from the library or wait for it to show up on the remainder tables as it certainly will."
1,A totally useless screen saver.,'Nuff said. I could have created a better screen saver myself. Plus it really slowed down my computer. Hated it. Hated it. Hated it.
5,Atlantis Revealed!,A fascinating view on the myth of Atlantis and Steiner's understanding of its existence and significance. This book was extremely engaging and worth the effort!
1,lUCIFERIAN TRASH,"What a piece of new age Luciferian trash, the likes of Carl Jung, Madame Blavatsky, and Alice Bailey. Only worth the purchase to prove what an occultist he was, as well as his associates, from Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical society to Steiner's Anthroposophical Society. Good for documentation. And this new age garbage lives on in Steiner's Waldorf schools! I'm not sorry I bought the book, as Steiner's own words prove what he was and what he believed. Suggested reading, THE ARYAN CHRIST by Dr. Richard Noll."
4,this cover is great,"I bought this cover because I need to frequently remove it, and am only able to lift small amounts. It fills the bill beautifully, while offering reasonable security for the truck contents. A couple things I would suggest for improvements would be a hold down for the center section similar to what is used on the rear, and an easier way to clamp the front down. I have to lay in the truck bed to tighten the front clamps since I am not very tall, and have a Ford with the high box on it."
5,The Silent Witness by Pyramid Home Video,The Silent Witness is a compelling documentary. This film details the historical and scientific data supporting the research on the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin. This video is a must see for those who believe in the resurrection of Christ as well as those who doubt it. I base the 5 stars on the bases of content. It is a logical and illuminating series of fact however it is a documentary with the visual panache of a low budget film.
2,Basic Mount Capabilities,"The mount works well if you don't intend to swivel the tray at the end of the arm. Installation was straightforward and easy. However, when you rotate the tray at the end of the arm, the tray tilts from side to side. There was about 1"" difference from one side of the tray to the other. It ends up making the TV picture tilted. The support people at Sanus were very polite and sent a replacement part to me right away. The replacement part had the same problem so I am assuming it is a design problem. The box clearly states that rotating the tray is acceptable. It is very disappointing that I have to compromise how my TV is adjusted so that it doesn't have to look like it can slide off the tray."
3,Great For SOME Applications,"The material and workmanship of this TV mount is top notch and the assembly was easy enough if you have modest capabilities with a drill and screwdriver, however, the TV mount does NOT hold my Sony 24"" TV when placed in a corner. The detailed instructions on ""set-up"" were non-existant. After leveling and drilling and mounting, the TV was too big for placement in a corner. Probably would be great for a 20"" or less if you want to corner mount. Otherwise, the swivel arm would need to be mounted quite a distance away from a corner."
3,Don't order from rachelk02,3 stars out of 5 for the experimental aspect of the record but it's far from the craftiness of Closed Casket or KKKill the Fetus. I went to order vol.2. It was ordered on Christmas Day and I havn't recieved it yet. Don't buy from rachelk02 unless you want to waste your time.
5,It's Gold!,This Cuisinart Gold Tone Filter works perfectly along with the amazing Cuisinart DCC-1200 Brew Center to make great coffee. And it's easy to clean...highly recommended!
3,Coffee driver,"The construction of this filter is not very sturdy. I can see that if I am not careful with it, I will have to replace it soon. It is the only filter that fits my coffee maker so I have to use it."
2,"says it fits 2600 model, but .... yes and no...","Bought my 2600 a year ago, ordered this filter since the original was getting stainedand I wasn't sure how to clean it.The replacement arrived, and it's a Cuisinart filter, and on its box it says it fits Model 2600,but the filter is oval shaped unlike the original gold filter that came with the coffee maker.I find the original round filter fits perfectly, just drops in,but this replacement requires an extra downward push and click to make it fit into the basket.Don't like it for that reason. Decided to continue using the original and keep this for a spare.P.S. Since I ordered the replacement I found out by accidentI can best clean the stains off the filter when the filter is DRY.I had been trying to clean it WET and it wasn't working very well)."
1,Don't buy this!!!!,"I have a Cuisinart coffee maker, model DCC-1100. This filter was supposed to fit, but it does not. And the handle came off instantly. I could use it without the handle if the filter fit, but, to repeat, it does not fit!"
3,Not exactly the same,"It's not exactly the same gold tone filter I received with my Cuisinart. I know this because I lost the filter in a move and replaced it shortly thereafter. It does not fit exactly the same way and the filter itself has a different hue. It still works, though."
4,Does the trick.,"Though the filter is not a perfect fit for my ""Grind & Brew"" 300 - if you take the time to adjust it - it keeps the grinds down to a minimum. I've had mine for about two months now and it seems to be holding up {bought an extra one as a backup}.What a difference in taste - compared to the paper filters."
5,Good buy,"I bought one of these as a replacement for a broken one. For the money I paid for it I could not beat it; the shipping actually cost more than the filter. I bought one, but I wish I had bought two keeping one as a spare. They are cheap enough to do so. If you find yourself in this situation and find them at a good price, consider getting a spare."
3,Misinformation,Though this may be an excellent product I should not have bought it. I ordered a Sanyo SAC-MST6 coffee pot and the Amazon website indicated that buyers of this coffee pot also bought the Cuisinart GTF Filter. But the filter is for a 12 cup coffee pot and the Sanyo SAC-MST6 is a 6 cup coffee pot. It does not fit. I gave it away to a friend of mine but was dissappointed.
2,Who would have thought?,"I ordered a 4 cup Cusinart coffee maker. On the order page, there were additional items listed with an indication that these items were accessories to the coffee maker above them. I bought a gold filter. As it turned out, that gold filter was not the model for the coffee maker on that screen, but for another size maker. I guess I was to blame for not researching the description, but I relied on Amazon. Won't do that again!"
1,Totally disappointed,"I bought this item with the impression that permanent coffee filters made coffee taste better, but I can honestly say it doesn't. Once more, there are still grounds in my coffee and a disgusting syrup at the bottom of my cup. I'm not sure if the filter I got is bad. It did come from Amazon and I haven't had problems with anything I've got from them, so I'm not necessarily accusing them of giving me bad product, but I'll leave that open for later interpretation.Cleaning this item is not easy at all. Some of the grinds fall out, but not enough of them. You get a huge clump on the bottom that will not move.I bought this filter with my grind and brew coffemaker and I have to say that both are becoming more trouble than they are worth."
1,Not pleased,The filter allows sediment and coffee grounds to get into the coffee. It leaves the same in the bottom of the cup.
5,Cuisinart GTF filter is golden,"This filter works great and is an excellent replacement for the (sometimes rather messy) paper filters. IMHO, Cuisinart should include this filter as standard equipment with their coffee makers."
1,Broke after a few weeks,"My filter broke after 2-3 weeks of using it. I was always very careful about emptying it and cleaning it. I called Cuisinart to see if they could replace it since I assumed it was covered under warranty and both the coffee pot and filter were only 2-3 weeks old. I was rudely told by the customer service rep that the filter broke because it was MY FAULT. There couldn't have been any defects because he said I broke it. Seriously? The coffee pot is working fine, but I am leary of Cuisinarts products now, as I have purchased several recently and half of them are not functioning properly. I can't believe this is how they treat loyal Cuisinart customers. I even sent a letter and an email registering my complaint and was ignored. I am very disappointed with Cuisinart's quality and service. I will no longer buy their products."
1,"It's a ""lemon.""","My original filter developed a tiny split at the bottom in the middle, where the gold mesh pulled away from the molded plastic. The replacement filter worked fine for a week. Then the mesh pulled away from the plastic in about a 2"" split down the side during one of the brewing cycles. Maybe it's a ""lemon."" So I'm back to the original."
2,Oval filter - does not fit,The photo and dimensions suggest that this filter has a round top. However the actual filter has an oval top and does not fit my machine.
1,be careful with amazons recommendation of other buy this with,"dont fall for the recommendations to buy with or also buy with - this was not even the right filter for the coffee maker, the high end cuisinart coffee makers are completely contained you need to buy nothing more period. so do not buy extra anything when you buy high end coffee makers."
1,be carefull,i bought this as a package with a coffe maker. this was not compatable so i wasted my money. it's not worth the postage to return it so it goes in the trash.
1,Disappointed,"Sad to say, when I opened the custom Cuisinart Gold Tone Filter I had purchased, I found one identical to the one that comes in the box with the coffee maker. The problem, no fill marks to indicate 4, 8, 12 cup measures. I returned it and am surprised that a company like Cuisinart can't make a filter with these markings like Krups, Braun and others. How much more can it cost to manufacture the filter with those markings???? So I am disaappointed with the coffee maker and the filter and Cuisinart in general!"
5,Excellent Product,"This is a great product if you do not want to spend money on buying paper filters. It is easy to clean and easy to use, and it has a great price. I recommend it to anyone looking to stop buying paper filters."
5,Filter,I ordered this because I got so tired of using paper filters. Also I got a new coffee maker so I wanted to change. I have to say that I love this. To be able to save a little money and the taste of the coffee is much better. Well made also. Thanks!
5,Best money I ever spent,"This filter works just as well as the paper filters but you don't have the waste of throwing the paper ones away. In the current green climate this works for me. Also, it is very well made and cleans easily."
4,Gold Tone is the best!,"I really enjoy my new gold tone filter for my coffeemaker. It is so superior to paper filters that I will never go back to using them. THe clean up is easy to, just discard the coffee grounds down your disposal and rinse the filter under the tap. It's a keeper!"
1,Didn't fit,"Did NOT fit my coffee maker even though it was one of the models listed. The image and dimensions make it appear to be a round-topped filter (which is what I needed), but when it arrived it had an oval-shaped top."
5,Necessary item,This filter just seems to last and last. Fits my Cusinart coffee make perfectly. Ever to easy to clean every morning.
5,"Did not fit in my CuisinArt mini coffeemaker, but it did fit inside my 1 cup maker",BUT it did fit in my 1 cup coffee dripper that fits just over my coffee mug so i am still significantly reducing the amount of coffee filters i use. My mini coffeemaker is really for when we have guests stay over but daily i use my 1 cup maker where you pour the water over.I put this next to the sink when i am done and when i come home later the coffee grounds are dry enough to just dump it into my Kitchen Compost bin.
2,I would not...,"I like my coffee black. I don't like it cloudy. When I used only the gold filt, my cup of coffee was a bit cloudy and had sediment in the bottom of my cup. I used a paper filter with it and enjoyed a good clear cup of dark black coffee. Then I just stopped using the good tone filter and had ... yup, a good clear cup of dark black coffee. I would spend the cash on a couple pounds of good beans rather than the filter."
4,Seems fine,Looks and fits like the original filter it replaced. So far it perfomrs well. Time will tell how it holds up.
3,Gold standard?,"There are pros and cons to this conical, gold-coated filter.Pros: You can reduce the use of paper products.Your filter never runs outMakes an ok cupCons:Finer grinds make more sludge in the bottom of the carafe, just not as good a filter as paper.The gold eventually wears off. It is bonded to the mesh, but gold is relatively inert and doesn't bond well to anything.I've bought a few of these over the years, but overall, I prefer brown filter paper for coffee making."
2,Not for fine ground coffee!,"Like any other permanent filter on the market, this requires weekly cleaning with vinegar, or other cleaner to keep build up on filter from adding bitterness to coffee. Permanent filters are also not recommended for finely ground coffee, at least not without the addition of a paper filter, preferably unbleached."
3,Cuisinart Basket,It works okay. Paper filters filter the coffee better. This leaves a lot of dark residue in the coffee. I won't drink the last two cups because it looks like sludge!
4,Filter is fine,"Purchased this Gold Tone Filter for our Cusinart coffee maker. However, we returned thecoffee maker as we were unhappy with the Cusinart. Bought a Zojirushi Thermal Carafewhich we love."
4,Just one little thing,I use this product every day and it does what it is supposed to but I wish the very bottom of it was flat so I could sit it up to scoop my coffer into it.
1,cuisinart coffee filter,did not work with my model as advertised. Description was very vague and misleading not worth the trouble to corredt
3,good,"It is clear that it makes the taste of coffee better, but it doesn't filter coffee powder enoughly. I can see the powder in the pot after I brew it."
3,Gold Tone Filter - Used for 2 Weeks,"Good design. Cleaning: Time consuming and I use a lot of warm to hot water. Does not filter as well as the paper cones. Leaves a lot of dark heavey coffee in the bottom of the pot and in your cup if you mix it up. Coffee tastes ok. If you really want to use this, buy two or three. That way you can rinse it out and put in dishwaher instead of cleaning it so much. We went back to the paper ones. Wanna buy mine!"
5,love it,"I really love this filter for my coffee pot. It is an excellent ""green"" option, as you don't ever have to buy throw away filters again. The water filters through the grounds with ease and no mess! Perfect gift for that ""coffee lover that has everything"" on your list!!"
5,Filter Perfect,Purchased this because I was sick of running out of paper filters. Works great. One draw back is last cup does have a lot of sedament in it but coffee other than this come's out great. Easy cleaning also.
1,Filter has holes,"I don't know if I got a defective item, but my filter has multiple holes, two at the bottom and one on the side. The holes are large enough for ground coffee to fall through. The one on the side is quite large, like it was not properly made and the filter material was not aligned with the plastic frame supporting it, leaving a gap between them. In any case, the filter is not usable as a coffee filter. To be able to use it, I have to put a paper filter to line it, which beats the purpose of having a permanent coffee filter."
3,not packaged well,"I received the filter via first class mail 7 days after I ordered it. There was absolutely no packing in the box protecting the filter - I'm glad I have learned to use caution when opening boxes, as if I had put the blade straight through the tape I would have ripped the filter, that's how tight it was packed in the box. I would not order from this company again. The filter is fine and would rate 5 stars. The few stars is due to lack of packaging making it easy to damage."
5,very good deal,good deal and perfect it fit perfectly and worked just fine. i saved much moneyit was just what was needed for this unit
3,Works well at first,These work well at first but after a while they start to leave a metallic taste in your coffee and they need to be replaced. Until that they make a good cup of coffee.
3,Good Value,"This is my second gold filter, though the price is good, it survived less than half as long as my first one, a Krups."
5,Works great.,"Leaves the flavor of the coffee in the coffee, not in the paper filter. Won't bend over and spill the grounds into your Carafe. Cuisinart is always a trusted manufacture."
5,Great Filter,"I replaced my old filter after a few years. My coffee is filtered better, and tastes great again. I tried ordering parts like this from Cuisinart but its so expensive because of shipping. It is more durable that the old one I had as well."
2,Leaves too much sludge in the coffee,"I bought this to use for a one-cup dripper. It leaves so much sludge in the coffee that it's distasteful to drink. Would probably be OK if using a very coarse grind, but for regular pre-ground coffee, or my own ground beans, it's just too coarse a filter. I have to throw out the last of my cup, and cannot drink the whole thing because of the sludge."
3,I do use this for soy milk not coffee...,It does seem to clog up pretty quickly. Stuff wedges under the black plastic and into the mesh. I really do wish that it didn't have black plastic that I'm pouring boiling hot water into.
1,OK if you don't care about the handle...,"Bought two, as the handle on the original (came with the coffee maker, lasted four years) broke. The handle on one was essentially broken when received, the other broke after four uses. When contacted the seller they were kind enough to provide the phone number of the manufacturer....and that was the end of the story. Not worth the effort to return, but definitely not happy."
5,Good substitute!,"I generally prefer paper filters, but I love having the gold tone filter on hand for those days that I run out of paper filters! I also find that I tend to alternate day-to-day. I'll use the gold filter because it's easy and I keep it in my coffee maker, but when it's dirty or in my dishwasher, then I default to my paper filters. For that reason, I love the convenience and options it allows me, but overall, it works great and I have no complaints; good purchase!"
3,Cusinart GTF filter,"Disposable filters are not that expensive but I still dont like the idea of continously spending money on them. My only concern with a reusable filter would be germs however, the water going through it is ususally hot so that would kill the germs. I guess I have mixed feelings. you do have to take time to clean them."
3,Not good for finer grind coffee.,"If you like finer grind or dark coffee, then this is NOT the filter for you. The filter leaves a noticable amount of coffee grounds on every pot. After a weeks of use, I finally switch back to good old paper filters. I haven't try the filter on regular grind coffee and I'm sure it works well. But if you drink mainly finer grind coffee, then I would not buy this, unless you enjoy coffee grounds in your coffee"
5,Old design for today's diving challenges,"Old school fins, they are more than 30 years old design; they provide great performance with minimal effort. I own high performance modern fins from another manufacture and there are no comparisons to the Jetfin. My finning technique has improved with the Jetfin and my air consumption has been reduced. I do recommend them for recreation divers and they are a must for technical dive."
4,Jet Fins,"The fins were in the condition that was described. Only one complaint, (happened to work in my favor in the end) was the fact that they were being sold as 2X-large when in fact the fins were only large. The pair work great otherwise!"
4,Better than most,"This is a really good album and one of the freshest hardcore records to be released in a long time. Yes, there's a tremendous amount of liberal political overtones but as I'm personally neither here nor their on a lot of current political issues, it doesn't really bother me. I'm more intrigued by the musicianship and experimentation found on this album such as the implementation of synth/keys into a traditional hardcore sound and the cover of The Beatles ""A Day In The Life"" with slightly altered lyrics."
4,Compliments From Everyone,"I love this product because I have rosacea and it completely cleared up this facial rash problem after dermatologist prescriptions did not.However, the compliments I got on my skin were an incredible bonus. I started using this product about 4 years ago, when I was 52 years old. Everyone I met told me my skin looked better than ever and that my skin was ""glowing."" What was my secret? I used Alpha Lipoic Acid Face Firming Activator with NTP and DMAE, applied only once a day, in the evening.I would give this product 5 stars if the price wasn't so high. It's worth it! But I would love to have it be more affordable. I skimp on using it and easily make it last 6 months or more.Hope it works as well for you. I will probably use it for the rest of my life. I can't believe I finally bought a facial treatment that works so beautifully!"
3,Not a fan,"My 11.5 month son is luke-warm about these. He may show interest over time; but considering that he's had them since birth, his reaction has pretty much been the same every time we put them out for him to play. It's true that not all toys will be a hit, this one in particular is a miss. I'm not a fan either since the blocks are surface washable only."
2,Disappointed,"I expected more from this toy. There is only one rattle sound and it is not very loud, my 6 month old I can't shake it hard enough to hear the rattle. My child has no interest in the flaps on the blocks."
5,Trick Toy,This Toy is the greatest. Our Granddaughter is 1 year old and plays with these ALL the time.
5,Good for very young children,"I purchased these for the young (under one year) daughter of an acquaintance. They are an unusually good set of blocks, being soft, multicolored, and with varying designs. Some have peek-a-boo windows and doors, and some have rattles inside. The only possible drawback is that the ""windows and doors"" could become torn lose with extended use, but they are a good value and would be expected to last as a young baby grows. They come in a convenient zippered storage case which has some baby features. I would rate these as a ""best buy"" for young babies."
3,More attractive for adults than kids,"These blocks are soft, colourful, with fun flaps and interesting pictures- just the sort of toy every parent thinks their kid would want. So, I bought these blocks when my daughter was 6 months old (she's 2.5 now) and like the previous reviewer's child, she never really liked payed them more than a moments attention. I thought they might be more of a hit with my son (who is now 7 months old), but so far they've been a flop too. It's a shame as before I had kids I bought them for all my friends with babies thinking they'd be great toys."
2,Just OK,"I am not happy that you can't wash them. They get dirty over time and you just have to pitch them or keep using them as is. I wish they had been easier to clean. My baby only liked the when he was in the phase where they chew on everything. For stacking, they really aren't so great."
3,Fun blocks,"These were bought for my grandson's first Christmas when he was 8 months old. He was perhaps a bit young at the time, but still able to knock over anything you built with the blocks. They each have a door or window or something to spin or shake, each being different from the next. He is now not quite 2 years old and over the last year or so these blocks have been played with but never seem to hold his interest for very long."
3,grab toy,maybe its just my son. He's 9 months and does not stack them. he just likes grabbing the triangles. he crawls around the house with them in his hand.
1,Safety of foam questionable,"These are cloth covered foam...but what type? No information can be found online about the safety of the foam. Since many foam products off-gas and release carcinogenic & toxic (PBDEs) chemicals, I don't want this around my baby. Especially since she is likely to put them in her mouth (sucking on the fabric and then really ingesting the foam stuff). I wish I could find out more about the material in these blocks, because they seem like they would be good for her otherwise. So few options for non-toxic soft blocks!"
2,My 12 Month Old Wasn't Interest in It,"Looks great and I like it; however, my 12 month old got bored shortly aftwards. Definitely not his favorite toy. It doesn't stack well compared with hard blocks.. Perhaps it is better with a younger baby."
5,Couldn't be happier with this product!,"After considering several types of soft blocks for babies, I went with these and am so glad that I did. They are fantastic for joint play with my 6-month-old and he is fascinated with the different textures, sounds, and peek-a-boo windows on the colored blocks. I recommend these blocks because:1) You get more blocks (16) for your money compared to other brands.2) They are well sewn and the fabrics seem sturdy (and surface washable).3) They are actually stackable.4) Each of the 8 colored blocks have different textured fabrics on each side, windows you can open, and pleasant sounds (bells, crinkles, rattles).5) Multi-racial characters on them."
5,knock knock blocks,My 7 month old loves the blocks. The different textures and bright colors make it very appealing to him. My 2yr old tries to play with him! Very interactive toy that we can play as a family. :)
3,pretty fun for baby,"Our one year old enjoys these blocks mostly for knocking them down over and over. The windows are inventive with different people inside including different races which is refreshing. if you have dust or any thing but a spotless floor, though, the block material picks up dirt easily and need washing."
2,17 month old still not interested,"I got these when my son was very young, thinking he'd play with them for a long time. In the beginning they were too big so he preferred stacking with smaller plastic blocks. He is now 16.5 months and still has no interest in them. I think a small child would be better off with a set of one or two to hang on to to crinkle. I would not buy this again or recommend."
3,"Fun project, but size is misleading","I purchased these for myself to decorate. I love that they are individually packaged with glitter pens and jewels. I am not going to be able to use them for what I intended to, however, because the description said they were roughly 4x4. I naturally assumed that meant that the photo opening was 4x4, but it's the actual frame itself. The opening is 2x2. I kept them because I didn't want to lose my shipping cost. I just wish it was more clear. I'm going to save them for a project for my daughter down the road."
5,Great book on Goal Setting,"I give it 5 stars. I enjoyed this book very much. Just a great book on goal setting. Straight forward and practical approach. Provides an action plan. Very entertaining and provides tremendous focus. I particularly enjoyed his info on ""How to Finish what you start"". I believe this a must read and a must have."
4,Awesome,"This book was a good read took only a couple days, great book for goal setting or if your in a tough place in your career"
3,Not much new,"You have to hand it to Keith Ellis. He's created a new hook for the goal-setting self-help book market.There's not much new here that you won't find in other goal-setting books. Mostly he changes the word 'goals' to 'wishes', but its a fine distinction. And there is a lot more inspirational, 'you can do it' talk. But if you have read other goal setting books, this is about the same.It's not bad, as goal setting books go, but it's nothing new."
1,A confusing mess,"There are so many twists and turns in this novel that it is hard to keep track of the story. Worst yet, nothing is ever really resolved! There are hints that some (in fact, MOST) of the characters are not who they appear to be, but the ending does not follow through with the answers. The sad part is that the novel starts out with great promise with a biochemist discovering (very) ancient Ediacara fauna in the depths of the ocean. The author definitely should have ran with this thread instead of the one that he chose."
1,Waste of effort...,"Compared to Bear's other works, this is a relatively short novel, yet I had a hard time finishing it, nonetheless. He seems to have taken Arthur C. Clarke's example and written a story readable in a few hours, lacking depth in story and characters, just because a book with his name on it will probably sell. I can't believe the author of incredible works like Queen of Angels and The Forge of God would bother to put out a half-assed effort like this. Ultimately dissapointing. I've just bought my last Bear hardcover."
2,A Complete Waste Of Time!,This is my first book by Greg Bear & my last. It is one of the worse books I have ever read. I read half of it & I simply couldn't take anymore of it. I skipped to the ending & it only confirmed my opinion. I read a lot & I rarely don't finish a book unless it is really bad. Save yourself & don't bother with this book!
2,Huh?,"When I heard that Greg Bear had written another contemporary bioscience fiction novel I became excited. Unfortunately, my excitement came to nothing. Vitals does not follow in the tradition of Bear's Darwin's Radio and Blood Music. Instead it is more of an action/political thriller novel with shallow characters, ambiguous conspiracies, and far-fetched science. Don't be fooled by the first few chapters of the book! Although they are fiction about science and scientists, most of the book has nothing to do with either. If Greg Bear's intention was to write a book that could bridge the gap between science fiction and political thriller he failed miserably; Vitals does not work well as either, and works worse as both."
2,Ending not worth the effort,"I really wanted to like this book. I saw Greg Bear live (he gives great book-tour presentations; not to be missed!) and was really interested after seeing his presentation. Also, the biotechnology stuff is very well done, clearly explained, and very interesting.Unfortunately, the story is not very interesting. The characters are confusing, and the plot has an odd flow. Bear tips his hand about what is going on pretty early, and so you keep expecting some twist on that story as you plod through the middle. At the end, things are left in a very ambiguous state, with the main narrator just kind of wondering what happened, and not really sure. Since you aren't sure either, you kind of wonder why you wasted your time reading the last half of the book. Plus, Bear switches narrators a couple times during the book. The transition is disjointed, and gives the impression of a novel that needed an additional round through the editing cycle."
3,Great Idea but Poor Execution,"This was a very gripping and frightening book that ultimately fell apart. I'd read Bear before--both _Darwin's Radio_ and _Blood Music_--so I had high hopes for this book and they were largely met, for about the first 3/4 or so of the book. Ultimately, though, the book does NOT come to a satisfactory conclusion. Nothing is resolved and the main character is just adrift. And this doesn't read like the set-up for a sequel. It's just a disappointing non-ending. And that's sad, because Bear's idea here, that the same bacteria/genes which might hold the secret to immortality are also the key to mind control, is pretty well-developed, with some pretty dark, horrifying hints as to what the Soviets, who stumbled upon the secret 70 years ago, were doing with it. I liked the characters and felt that there was plenty of intrigue to the book, but I sure would have appreciated a conclusion that wrapped things up a bit more."
5,Great Book!,"I can't believe this is reviewed so badly! I thought this was one of Greg's best books. The science was very interesting and the story was great. Admittedly, the Stalin thing was a bit over the top, but other than that this was a great read."
3,Intriguing premise,"The premise and the novel itself start out promisingly enough but it seems that the narrative devices start becoming intrusive at around the halfway point. I am grateful that the novel made me want to delve into the science further but, beyond that, Crichton's ""Andromeda Strain"" is a far better crafted novel of microbial invaders."
2,This one flat-lined,"After reading Bear's foundation sequel and Darwin's Radio, I attacked this puppy with gusto. The tempo is off from the start - taking a vascillating first-person view, swapping around main characters. About half way through, the novel turns Clancy-meets...well...I guess VC Andrews?!? In the end, I felt cheated and wanting. Given the book had promise, it's saved from a single star...but it still feels as if I'm being generous. I suggest avoiding this one and let's hope the next Bear book is better."
2,A Waste Of Time,"The author writes heavenly for the first 1/4th of the book; great premise and exciting action. Then - unaccountably - the rest of the book is a confusing mess with the author making every possible error a ""thriller"" writer can make. It is difficult to believe that the brilliant scholarship that is so evidently displayed in the beginning can denigrate into such an ineffective, rambling narrative. Either the author fell in love with himself and thought he could get away with anything - or - he is ""on"" something. Don't waste your time with this one. You will be inevitably disappointed."
2,"Vital Beginning, Slimy Center, Moldly Ending","The beginning 1/3rd of the book has sufficiently clever plots twists and mysteries for me to unravel. Unforntately, Greg Bear introduces a rather boring 2nd character to narrate the story in the middle 1/3rd. I found this 2nd character to be too distracting from the best parts of the story. In the last 1/3rd, Greg Bear introduced too many major themes for my taste. In the end, it reminded me of my refrigerator where all the food spoiled, and everything evolved into quarrelling intelligent life forms.On the technical side, Greg Bear's mind controlling bacteria had a flaw that was insufficiently exploited. If you became infected, you could have been contolled by anyone, not just by the villains. Greg Bear made the mind control triggers too open and too vague for a science fiction book.Darwin's Radio by Greg Bear was much much better."
2,Oops-a -daisy,"'Vitals' isn't on-par with 'Slant' or his more recent effort, 'Darwin's Radio'. The book starts out OK but disgorges the main plot twist almost immediately, and for the next 2/3 thickness, he rehashes, homogenizes and pasteurizes the microbe thing with a variety of rubber stamps (unusual treatment by him)."
3,"Oh, this was a frustrating book.","Great idea. Wonderful setup. I loved the characters-- found them darker and more interesting than Bear characters usually are. I was *entranced* for the first one third of the book.Unfortunately, the success of the setup is only matched by the failure of the execution. The conspiracy theory gets so confused that by the end I had completely lost track of who was doing what-- unfortunatly I no longer cared enough to go back and figure it out more carefully. What was interestingly complex became tortured and convoluted and in the end it was dragged down by its own weight.This said, I did find it an interesting new direction for Bear and there are aspects of it I hope to see picked up and followed through on in a later book."
3,Great Thriller with a dead ending,"Greg Bear does some great work. Vitals is a powerful thriller. It's intense, somewhat scary and really makes you think.The reason it only gets 3 stars is that the ending is pathetic. There isn't a conclusion so much as the author saying, ""OK, I'm done, you can go about the rest of your life now.""It's worth the time to read it, just don't bother with the last five or so pages. It really ruins the power that developed in the whole novel."
4,Good SF!,"I don't know what the previous two reviewers were reading but it wasn't the audio book I listened to. This is good SF! Playful with science and a plot that keep you interested. Yes, the first part is better than the later portion of the book and yes you can make some comparisons with Crichton and (yawn) yes it's about a conspiracy, but if you can't see the Bear style in this you're blind! Award material? Not qualified to judge (not another 'Blood Music', but I like it). Worth your $s and time? Yes! Keep up the good work Greg! We who like people who work at (not just 'play at') ...... REALLY appreciate it!!"
2,The Little Mothers are disappointed,"(a phrase from the book).Surprisingly disappointing after Bear's history of books that I have enjoyed. I was hoping for something as interesting as Darwin's Radio.Well, the science in this one is fairly interesting at least. But the plot reminded me of a Ludlum wannabe (or Koontz or Cussler). It's full of mysterious people, shadowy recollections, and worst of all, mean old Russians. I dunno.Bear explains a lot of science in interesting ways, and hypothesizes interesting ""growth areas"". Most of the relationships are fairly well explored (for this genre). It just breaks down when the action (in a guns and bombs sense) gets rolling."
2,"Very, VERY disappointing!","Not at all typical of Bear's usual work which is lucid, well-written and coherent. This book started out quite strong but seemed to lose steam toward the final third, almost as if Bear lost interest in the novel while he was writing it. It's a shame, really, since the characters have the potential to be very interesting and the premise, while farfetched (see David Cortesi's Feb 24 review for an excellent anlysis) was involving. Coincidentally, I read _Vitals_ soon after I had read Greg Iles' _Footprints of God_. The premises are similar, but the Iles book actually ends better than does Bear's (though I'm not implying Iles' ending was very good)."
1,"Greg Bear Flatlines in ""Vitals""","""Vitals"" is a disappointment. I have read and enjoyed almost everything that Greg Bear has written, and this book is way below his normally high standards. The scientific premise behind the book, that bacteria/genes can cooperate to form a super-mind, was dealt with more thoroughly in ""Slant"" and ""Darwin's Radio."" Bear wraps this premise with a story that is meant to evoke the hardboiled detective novels of yesteryear where the protagonist is surrounded by a web of deceit and nothing is what it appears to be. However, the result is dark, clammy and paranoid. More significantly, none of the characters are likable, and some are just repellent. Also, it's obvious that ""Vitals"" was written in haste. I found the multiple narrators confusing, and the ending was clearly tacked on at the last minute.I know from past experience that Mr. Bear is capable of great things. I would suggest that he spend more time writing and less time listening to his editors."
2,Over edited ?,"It starts so well but has the feeling that it is a much longer book that has been edited, and not very well, for page number reason as there are gaps in the story that cry to be filled in. This feeling is reinforced as the author, in the epilogue, gives a timeline and brief summary of events, but too late. I have read other books by Greg Bear and they are all far better. It is a shame as it has the potential to be a great story and throughout there are great descriptive passages and the story dealing with immortality and control of people by of viruses is intriguing."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Getting to the guts of eternal life.A researcher, employing a lot of lateral thinking and investigation of other areas is looking at life extension techniques and methodology. When it appears he is getting close, attempts are made on his life, and the good old shadow conspiracy type of story starts to happen, which also apparently includes his brother.Here it appears that Bear is turning into some sort of speculative thriller writer, so with half a dozen of one and half a dozen of another, not hat satisfying a book, overall."
3,"Interesting premise, but a so-so read",This started out with such promise because it was something different. It becomes confusing not only to the protagonist but to the reader as well. It limped home to an unsatisfactory ending in my opinion.
2,I don't think I am smart enough for this book,"Well, what can I say? I have read many of Bear's other works and have found them all readable and enjoyable. In many of his other works, he deal with a lot of hard science, but despite this, it has always been presented in a way that allows someone not versed with the subject to follow along. This is not the case with 'Vitals'. I kept saying 'huh?' throughout the book, whenever it started in on the science. Like I said, I don't think I am smart enough for this book. In some cases it read more like a text book than it did a novel. As far as the story is concerned, I liked many parts, but the conspiracy was so complex, that by the end, I was just reading to finish the book, and hoped that it made sense to me. It didn't."
2,Not up to his usual standards,"I love Greg Bear's books. I've read each one, at least twice. Darwins Radio made me sit and think for a long time, then I had to read it again. I am extraordinarily disappointed in Vitals though. It was all I could do to get through the book. The book is darker than any of his other books (Blood Music included) with a muddled protagonist and almost one dimensional characters. The idea of the book is intriguing, but the execution is poor and the end just happens. It seems like the end of the book is an afterthought, almost as if he had written enough and had to wrap it up in 5 pages. Too bad since it could have been great. One book won't make me give up on his writing, since the rest has been so good, but I do hope his next book will be back to his usual."
3,Kinda flimsy,"They look like OEM mirrors but are kinda flimsy, they do not hold there position but will do the trick"
3,LOWST PRICE ON THE NET,"a bit slow to get to me , but this iten sells as high as $50 on the web. cant beat this price."
5,Excellent source for lawyers wannabe!,"This book is mind opening for those who want to be lawyers. It presents the reality in the life of the lawyer within himself, family, work and society. It also presents the truth that lawyers are afraid to say when working for a firm. After reading it you might learn that the time and money spent might not be worthy. It is an insight in the career for those who know nothing about what they will be facing."
4,Great fun for a beginning walker!,"My daughter received this toy when she was 16 months old. She loved to hear the sounds as she walked across the mat! She has kind of gotten bored with it, so we have it in the hallway to her playroom, so everytime she goes to play, she will step on it and hear the sounds. My one complaint is that she has to hit the foot mark just right or else it won't make any sounds, also you have to step on it pretty hard to get a sound. (Not good for kiddos who step softly) although my girl doesn't have too much trouble with it."
1,boring... don't waste your money,My son got this for Christmas and it only had about 1 minute worth of entertainment value. My son walked down the mat once and then was on his way to something else. Find something else.
1,Poor Performance,"I purchased this product. Contacted the Company to make sure My camera was compatable and which connection to use. I charged the battery overnight. Then took it to my kids first swim lessong. Excellent performance. After that one day I could never get a shot out of it. I could Charge it over night for for 2 days. It won't even power on my camera any more. I haven't contacted Unity, but I wouldn't suggest this product to anyone."
4,"Great accomplishment, could be even greater","This is a monumental achievement and to be commended.My only comment is that the recording was done in St. Paul's Cathedral where the sound is very resonant. This makes the feel very ""churchy"" which is nice for the experience of the music. But, I like these recordings for devotional use and the resonance blurs the lyrics such that they can be difficult to hear easily, and in my opinion this is too bad. Would that the recording equipment had been configured to hear the voices close and clear.Maybe this recording could be remixed/enhanced so that the experience is first about the words and notes of the singers' voices?But get this one nonetheless, it's great text, great music, great experience of choral worship."
4,Gorgeous,"My wife is tickled with this watch, the blue face really complements the silver and gold colored bracelet which is very finely constructed. As noted above, the watch face is a bit smaller then the picture would indicate. Still, very stylish, perfect for a dainty wrist. Her friends are impressed too."
2,MP PL3000 Power Cord,"This cable is expensive and I am unsure if it has any real benefits at all. The diameter of this cable is so large that it doesnt stay properly connected due to it's size and weight. You can use the best cable in the world, but if the connection is poor it defeats the purpose... Save your money and get a cable that isn't the size of a fire hose."
2,"Not Exactly A Collection of Gems. But, Worth A Listen, I Suppose.","George Lynch is a legend. So, when his name is attached or his playing is attached I'm usually pretty interested. This one is not great. The songs are flat and very rough. Certainly not the kind of demos that would get a record deal (and they didn't). Although, I really like Dokken: From Conception and found Lynch's playing on it to be a good snapshot of where his playing was at. This collection does not give you that feel. Go ahead and check this out. Just make sure you take it for what it is. A thrown together afterthough of songs. That showcase muscians not yet ready for the big time. Enjoy.From Conception: Live 1981"
5,Amazing Scroll Saw Blades,"These scroll saw blades are amazing and cut wood like butter and last a long time, I am still on my first blade I pulled out of the package"
5,Very nice and sturdy,"I remodel my entire master bathroom and installed 2 of these in the shower -- one is a shelf for shampoo and the other is lower for leg shaving.You will need a 16 x 16 inch tile to cover the top of the bench/shelf -- I didn't use mud (within the unit), and it works wellCan't imagine someone being able to sit on one of these"
5,Excellent!!,Excellent.One of the best records in the history of the Argentinian Rock.All the instruments played by himself.10 points.
5,Olivier Latry's Franck,"Superb performances, beautifully recorded...can't go wrong.The product was in perfect condition, shipped promptly and received intact.Happy customer."
1,A manual for Christian proselytizers,"This book sets up Eastern religions as a series of strawmen and then provides tips for knocking them over. As an manual for Christian evangelical chauvinists it undoubtedly would provide a reassuring read. On the other hand, if you are interested in actually learning about these religious traditions Amazon stocks many other books that serve that purpose and are not written with the intent to disparage other faiths."
4,seiko Women's Watch #SZZC34,This is a beautiful watch. It is exactly as pictured. The face is small and neat very much suited for persons with small hands. Excellent product.
1,Entertaining Mr. Stone,"HORRIBLE.I brought this book because of the reveiws. It was just GHASTLY!! I couldn't even finish it because it was just BAD, BAD, BAD. I have returned it to the store. Also I gave it 0 stars, but amazon wouldn't let me submit w/no star check. So my review is for 0 STARS!!"
5,A great book for anyone's investment library,"As a reader of the Washington Post, I get a chance to read Jim Glassman every Sunday. He offers a positive, long term approach to investing which is opposite to today's frenetic business press. If you are a follower the out smarter class of investors,(those that read the title and don't get the joke) you will hate this book. If on the other hand, you want a good read on how to treat money with patience, and perspective, this book will appeal to you. Glassman is to some of us the best business writer alive today. There are obviously lots of different investment approaches, Glassman's happens to appeal to me."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I am a big Glassman fan, but I was very disappointed in this book. Everything I have read by the author tells me that he thinks in the long-term, but now to write a book about why investors should consider the short-term is indeed a contradiction. I read the book cover to cover and I did not find a secret. What Glassman calls a secret is basically standard investment advice that he has talked about for years. His last book Dow 36,000 looked at the market long-term and as of this writing his prediction for the Dow has not come true! There is really no secret to good investing and what troubles me is that Mr Glassman, an experienced investor, does not know that, or maybe he does??"
1,A Real Stinker,"When you buy a book like this you take it at face value. You expect there to be a secret code and you will be a better investor for it. Not so! I guess I was a little naive to think that this book would make me a better investor. There are a few good pages in the book for reference purposes, but I must say it was anything but a joy to read!"
5,Smart and Readable,"Most investment books sell a specific style of investing like growth or value or a variation thereof. This one advocates the only proven strategy: long-term investing. Glassman offers completely sensible strategies to achieve this aim. And, he writes better, more sensibly than any other financial writer."
3,No accountability,"How does this guy continue to get published after Dow 36,000? There's zero accountability in the finance sector, and apparently there is no accountability in publishing either. I wouldn't have a problem with a book called ""How I got it dead wrong, and how you can learn from my mistakes"" or something - we all make mistakes, just man up and admit it."
2,Liked the Title but did not like the book,"I liked the title of this book, but the book itself is far removed from the title. It makes a big promise with the title, but after reading it I did not feel like I knew enough to become a superior investor. I think one becomes a superior investor over time. Practice makes perfect---not reading this overdone book that does not deliver on its promise."
1,"Pure Marketing, Hype and on top of that a real bore!","First, after reading a few chapters of this book I never bought into its premise. There is no secret code and if there was I don't think a writer like Mr. Glassman would know about it. The writing is average, label-like reading that won't win any literary prizes. But the key element that I found most discouraging was what was not in the book. There is no new information here that makes the book a buy. You would think there would be since the information, at least from what I gleaned from the title, has been a secret thus far. This book is all about marketing and hype and shame on the author for trying to convince readers otherwise"
3,Bioethics in Latin America,"The title promises to broach a sorely needed subject but, instead of offering a perspective,the book presents 10 essays written by scholars from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico. The essays are competently written, the authors are knowledgeable in their chosen subjets, but they reflect the opinions of the authors, not those of Latin American academia. In fact, the major weakness of this anthology is that the reference lists are for the most part of anglosaxon origin, those from Latin America are often official documents. The voice of most countries in the region remains unheard, and the eforts of spanish writting bioethicists are as good as absent. The book shows the proficiency of some Latin American scholars, but the promised perspective remains to be written."
5,Great product,"I have varicose veins and these really help with the throbbing and pain I get, I really recommend them for any pain that you may have in your lower leg."
2,Marshall's has em' for 7.99,"I purchased two of them at Marshall's taday, and boy do they look awesome. Its not a toy - but rather an air freshner disguised as Disney Princesses mackin'. They look good as far as animation imagery that Walt would have wanted (the lips and eyes aren't blurry messes)I haven't opened ours yet, but rather online now looking for replacement cartridges to have a stock. AAA x 3 fyi.I bought one for little girl and one for my girly nieces. I will not put this item near children because of course it is clearly an aerosol dispenser. I think it will add a nice touch to a high shelf.A report remains until this product is opened and operated. :)"
4,A great CD with a few mistakes,"This CD is great. The orchestra members demonstrate great musicality. My high school marching band did a ""Music of the Wild West"" field show a few years ago, so this music was very nostalgic. The only thing there is to complain about is the relatively large (though still small compared to amature groups) number of technical mistakes made in the music. I still recommend this CD to anyone who loves a good sounding orchestra playing absolutely wonderful music (I especially like Silverado)."
4,Excellent Highway Design Reference,"This is an in depth reference for every aspect of horizontal and vertical geometry. Contains base theory, then all of the necessary equations for calculating sight distances, vertical curve lengths, horizontal and vertical curve obstructions. Some of the values used should be cross-referenced with values from the AASHTO Green Book, as some of the design values in the book may be out of date. Also discusses spiral curves, compund curves, unsymmetrical vertical curves. There are equations, detail narratives, and example problems in this book, that I have not seen in any other manual. An excellent companion to your Green Book, CERM, and HCM."
5,route location and design,The book arrived on time and in the condition I expected. Since it was no longer printed I was concerned about the possible condition. It was in good condition as advertised. The book I recieved was evidently a library book at one time. What a loss for that library. That library must not have catered to technical readers. Just because we can now do these calculations in AutoCAD does not mean we do not need to know how to do them without AutoCAD. Everyone still needs to learn this information for the day the electricity goes off and we still need to move forward.
4,Very good source book for eqpt and tactical use,"Though originally published in 1979, the 1996 edition reviewed here is a welcome addition to any reader's library. Amply interspersed with diagrams and illustrations, the book does also offer good detail on the types of weapons, including comments on their effectiveness in battle. The sections covering Infantry and Cavalry do not just discuss their respective weaponry; the tactics of each arm on the battlefield are also discussed in clear and concise terms. Artillery is described in like manner, allowing any reader unfamiliar with Napoleonic tactics (and wishing to learn about them) to establish a solid foundation of understanding with this book. Highly recommended for all readers, novices and historians alike."
3,Good book just for eqpt,"Ok, I rated it 3 stars. This because the book, very good about the eqpt, fail a little about how it was used, I mean tactics, and is not so comprehensive. Specially the cavalry and infantry subjects, lot of things to add. And there is some misquotations, one of them: when the cavalry `charges home' (attack) it runs from behind the enemy towards his own line, not the contrary.Even so a good choice for begginers."
4,A different type in the series-,"This book had a lot of creativity in it. It was funny, moving and a bit odd at times, but overall, it had caught my attention. In the regular love and laughter series, there is usually more romance and gaiety. But, it had the sense of magic and fairy like worlds in it, which any young teen likes to read and dwell upon. Read it, it will give you a different perspective of things after a few months."
3,Disappointing,"Although there is much to recommend about the writing of this book, the story doesn't belong in this genre. This is clearly a fantasy book. It was cute, but didn't belong in the Love and Laughter line. I was disappointed and felt misled after buying it."
4,"Very good, graphic.","I anxiously read this book with the knowledge of the author. I , with a librarian's knowledge of books, was pleasantly suprised. I enjoyed the gritty truth about the criminal and darker side of the wholesome image of Alaska. I look forward to reading his next book, keep up the good work Benny."
5,Excellent Book,This book goes in to a lot of technical detail on view camera operation. Haven't gotten very far into it yet but what I have seen is very very good. Look forward to spending more time with this book.
2,This Book Needs Updating or Another Publisher,"This 7th Edition was published in 1999, but a good bit of the material seems to date from an earlier era. Remarks about 35mm photography, for example, refer to a level of technology that prevailed much longer ago. The photographs (none in color) are very, very dated in style (were they made in East Germany?), and in fact many of them are held over from the 1st edition (1967). Worse, the pictures are disturbingly bizarre and creepy. I ripped page 78 out of the book to avoid having to see it again. This may the most comprehensive work available on the subject, but let's hope the 8th edition is a thorough revision - and please include a few marvelous color landscapes and fine B&W portraits that are the reasons we love the LF format.... and lose those awful distorted photographs of 1950s mannequins. Luckily, though, a lot of things about view cameras are the same as they have always been, so the basic content of this book remains altogether usable."
5,Nuts to Bolts - Everything you want know,"When anyone asks me what book they should read about how to use a view camera, I recommend Stroebel's View Camera Technique. I have a third edition and the 7th, while maintaining many of the original illustrations, the 7th edition is even better. If you are like me and want to know the how and why of view cameras. This is the book to read."
4,Not many books on the subject.,"There are not many books on the subject and this one is probably one of the best, along with ""Using the view camera"" by S. Simmons. The camera brands presentation part summs up into a hard to read table, not really helpful; but otherwise, this is a very good book for learning and perfecting large format techniques, even if the inside layout is slightly in retreat from what the cover would let us expect."
1,Coffee filter is junk,If you like coffee grounds in your coffee buy this filter. I personally don't like mud in the bottom of my cup.
4,Seller excellent...,"I purchased this as a backup to the filter that came with my Cuisinart coffee maker. It was not an exact match, but it works. It was about half inch shorter than the one recieved with the coffee maker... The seller was excellent and stands by his product. Thank you."
3,Not the Pictured Filter,"I happened to misplace my product manual for my coffee maker, but I figured it couldn't be too hard to purchase a replacement filter, if the picture matched. The picture for this item here IS the filter for my coffee maker, but the filter I received, definitely not. It's cone shaped, and very long. Too bad it's not worth the return shipping price. Now I'm stuck with a filter that has no purpose for me, and still no coffee."
2,Be Careful!,"I have had several issues with the basket ""clogging"" and creating a waterfall of molten hot coffee all over the counter. Be cautious on how much coffee you put in, and how fine you grind it! Ouch!"
2,cuisinart gtf-b gold tone coffee filter review,This coffee filter is great for an eight cup coffee maker. It does not work for 10 -12 cups.
4,Gold Tone Filter=Economical but not neat,"The gold tone filter works good, we don't see much in the way of little bits of grounds in the carafe at the end. It is also nice not to need to purchase filters or find a place to store them in the kitchen. However, the grounds do not come out of the filter easily. Whacking the filter on the edge of the trash can gets the bulk of them out, but then we still need to rinse a lot of them down the sink/garbage disposal."
4,Replacement for Gind and Brew,"Bought to replace the basket from my Cuisinart 12 cup Grind and Brew. This filter was the exact replacement. The basket handle was a little loose, otherwise the filter performed like the original."
3,Does this work in the Hamilton-Beech Stay or Go?,Does this filter work in the Hamilton-Beech Stay or Go Coffee Make? I just recently purchased this coffee maker and the gold tone filter that I purchased has a solid bottom which results in the grounds splashing back into the water stream and the brewing portion of the machine and makes a large mess. I have switched back to paper until I can find one that allows the coffee to filter through the bottom. Hope this one will work...please let me know.
1,Definitely not 10 cups,"Bought this to go with a non-Cuisinart coffee maker, so the problem may be in the difference in flow rate of my coffee pot and Cuisinarts. However, I brewed 10 cups (50 oz) of coffee and this thing overflowed like crazy. Even with just ground coffee (60 grams) in the basket it was over 3/4 full. I can see doing 8 cups with this, not 10, and definitely not 12."
5,Cuisinart is the best,Makes coffee beans taste and smell the way they should. No waste from the paper filters that you have to dipose of. Easy to clean.
4,gold tone coffee filter,"I love this thing. No more forgetting to buy coffee filters. It makes a delicious cup of coffee, and because more flavor gets through, you actually can use less grounds"
3,Too much sediment,I was hoping to avoid wasting paper and be environmentally conscious with a reusable filter. I don't care for the grounds sediment that escapes the filter. I'm back to using paper.
2,"Save your money, don't buy this. Use paper filters.","Use unbleached paper filters instead. The gold filter allows quite a few coffee grounds to pass through it, which then settle in the cup. An unbleached paper filter works far better, has no effect on the taste of the coffee, and the cleanup is simple. Note that this is described as a ""Gold Tone"" filter.Remember that paper is white because it's been bleached, which is usually done by using chlorine. Avoid the trace amounts of chlorine, and get unbleached filters."
5,Cuisinart Coffee Filter,"A filter that is reusable. Save money. Even though it is advertised that it may let coffee grinds through, I have not had that experience. Worth its money."
3,"Mmm, Coffee","Without this Cuisinart GTF-B Gold Tone Coffee Filter our coffee wouldn't the same. It would be all over the floor, and full of coffee grinds."
3,It works for other Cuisinart models,I took a chance and bought this replacement for a Cuisinart 'Grind & Brew' [...].I tried universal replacement brew baskets available at the stores with no luck; none fit.For some reason the model # was not on the replacement list of Grind & Brews..So I took a chance and it worked..
4,Very Good addition to my coffee maker,"But not perfect. I have a Cuisinart Grind and Brew and occasionally the grinds end up in my coffee because the basket is more shallow than paper filters. I do like that it's ""green"". 1/4th of an inch taller would be better for this machine."
2,Tough to clean and not heart healthy,"I have been using this (don't tell ;), but it is a pain to clean. You end up putting a lot of grounds down the drain. A bigger issue is that coffee has a lot of oils in it which are not good for you if you are a heart patient. The paper filter eliminates the majority of these fatty oils so it's one less source for you to be concerned with. (Learned this in cardio-rehab after my own heart attack). I will probably go back to using paper."
4,Ordered extra one for my coffee maker.,"Make sure the handle is folded down centered facing the front of your coffee maker when you insert this basket into it's holder. I LOVE not having to use disposable filters... I simply rinse this out before placing in the dishwasher, as I do with all the other parts for my coffee maker. This goes with my Cuisinart DGB-550BK Grind-and-Brew 12-Cup Automatic Coffeemaker, Black/Brushed Metal. Since I found myself wanting more than one pot of coffee, but that particular coffee maker works better if the parts are cleaned and dried after each use, I ordered an extra set of all parts, including this, and it made my life a lot easier."
5,Coffee Filter,"This filter was just as good as the original one that came with the coffee maker when we bought it, a very good purchase."
5,Get your Minions,"Of all the D20 products out so far, this has got to be the best I've seen. Not only is the content excellent, but the artwork and layout is also of the highest quality. Many of the other D20 items out there are good enough in content to use, but aesthetically fall short. Not so with Minions. If this is any indication to the quality we will continue to see out of Bastion Press, everyone else should pay attention. Buy this for your D&D campaign, you won't be sorry."
4,>:),Great selection of monsters for that DM wishing to cause havoc to their players. Enjoy many monsters and make it different each time.
3,I'm sure it's great but -,"but all of the songs listed on the two discs in this set in the product description are GERSHWIN songs, not Berlin. So don't purchase this set expecting to hear these songs!"
3,Average at Best,"Its a bit long in the tooth and needs to be updated. Very easy reading. Gives some good pointers. But, don't think its the only book you'll need to start your business."
3,Affair On 8th Avenue,"Have never enjoyed such a musical genius as Gordon Lightfoot. His crowning glory of course, would have to ""Gord's Gold"", with the exception of the leaving out of ""Affair On 8th Avenue"". Mr. Lightfoot's voice in my opinion, was at it's very, very, best during this time in his career. I purchased ""The Very Best of Gordon Lightfoot, Vols. 1-2"", specifically for the ""Affair On 8th Avenue"" song. It was NOT the more beautiful rendition that was on the ""Gord's Gold"" LP. As I have all of the other songs on other CD's, I now have a CD that will hardly if ever be listened to. Is there any hope that Mr. Lightfoot and/or the music industry will do a re-issue of ""Gord's Gold"" with the undeniably beautiful ""Affair On 8th Avenue"" on it?"
4,NICE COLOR STONE,Nice pair of amethyst earrings for the price. Color and clarity of stones were very nice. The stones are a good size also.
5,Cute and fun,"My girls love this Bullseye doll. High quality, nice soft plush, and works with the other dolls in this collection."
1,Bad History,"This is one of the worst attempts at writing a historical account of a major episode I have ever encounted. Bagnall was clearly a novice at this sort of thing and it shows throughout the book. There are numerous glaring errors in detail, such as misidentifying key figures, misplacing sites and dates of events, and an almost incredible lack of sensible analysis of the reasons or importance of events. The reviewer who referred to Bagnall as a (Hannibal) hero worshipper was quite correct - Bagnall is one of those Hannibal apoligists who finds it necessary to glorfy a loser at all costs, including the cost of truth. The comments of another reviewer concerning Scipio, the true victor of the second punic war, are as misguided as Bagnall's dismal attempt to write history. For the reader interested in this history, please read Goldsworthy, Hart, or Scullard - these are ligitimate historians!"
5,A good tool for Lent and throughout the year,This dynamite little book has to be a special tool for lent. It is so good at bringing me into the scene and helps with my meditation.
3,smaller than others,Already had holes in the crotch and are way smaller than the ones I have now in the same size. Gave them to my son.
3,Pay no attention to size,"These tend to be smaller than what they say. If you are on the big side and don't want to order 4xxx, go ahead and order 4xxx. I can wear 2x of other brands and I ordered 3xxx to be comfortable but whoa, they were snug. Hold the fat jokes please. Just telling it like it is for the guys who are making that choice. Nobody's looking. Gte the 4 if you're big. (I'm not talking majore obesity because these aren't for you.)"
1,pants are wrongly sized and returns are poorly refunded,"So I ordered these in hopes of getting some good around the house sweat pants, theyre sized closer to 2 sizes smaller then on the label when compared to unbranded or hanes products of the same size.So being an amazon prime customer I was easily able to return them, but they charged half the price of a pair of the pants as a ""restock"" fee, I dont know if they do this for every order returned or just me, because I had to remove the pants from the plastic bag to try them on.Needless to say I will not attempt to get a larger size of these pants from them since if they dont fit right I will be eating most of the cost in return fees."
2,size DOES matter,"These pants, size 3x, are barely the same size as a large in other brands. That's WAYYYY off base! Thin, cheap, junk. Anyone who applauds them for making them warm when they come inside, something ALL sweatpants do, is not reviewing the pants themselves. I am 5'1"" and the pants for my 3x hubby barely fit ME!I'm a medium. Useless and USELESS if you can't find a size that fits. Will be gifted to a skinny minnie ASAP,, never to be bought again."
4,Comfortable,Reviewed with the top. The only small negative would be that the elastic waist could have been a little tighter.
2,Nasty Pilling Syndrome,Worst case of pilling I've ever seen with sweats. Wouldn't wear them outside of the house and they are nearly brand new.
2,After one wash a hole,Sadly I was hoping for more of a performance out of these but just after one wash they had a hole in the seam at mid leg.I wouldn't buy these again.
3,uuuhm?,Needs a little more room in the upper legs area and the elastic at the bottom is a little tight.
1,Terrible Pilling!,"These pants are terrible. When they were brand new and before being washed, they began to pill. I put them in the wash and when I took them out of the washer I couldnt believe my eyes! They were pilled so badly that they are totally not wearable! They are so badly pilled with white balls I would be ashamed to wear them in public. Dont waste money on these. Spend a little more and purchase pants with at least 80 percent cotton content. I found out that the hard way......"
2,Large hole in seam,Pants had a six inch gap where the seam was not sewn properly. Great price but I wasn't expecting to sew it before wearing it.
3,Bit on the light side,"Pretty much what I wanted. I expected a bit heavier weight. Can't wear them outside on really cold & windy days. Drawstring not very sturdy anymore, waist elastic not really quality stuff either. Washed ok, wears ok. Just falls a bit short of the ""old days sweatpants""."
5,Very nice for the price,The black .....for 10 dollars is a steal.......runs a little small....but the waist has nice give to it.....light but warm....
4,nice warm and functional,"These were the better of the two pairs purchased. Lots of room in the thigh, length was good, pockets are handy, and the gusset area has space."
3,Smaller (waist) than some other sweatpants,"They do run smaller than other recent sweatpants I tried (like Champion and Jerzees). Those ""Large"" models fit me, but I'll have to get an X-Large in these Russell Athletic pants. I only briefly wore them to try them on, so I can't comment on durability."
2,Surprisingly disappointed.,"I read the reviews on these sweats before I ordered. Some of them made comment about them running small. The price was really good and I wear an X-Large. So I figured, I would get the XX-Large and be safe. I don't mind them running big, as long as they have closed bottoms and if they are small, I should still be able to get away with it. ""WRONG !!!!!!!"" When I got them I was excited. I tried them right away and I was so dissapointed. They felt like skinny jeans. I even asked my wife if she wanted them and they were too small for her. I called my daughter and she didn't want them. I believe this was only the second time I ever returned anything back to Amazon. Of course, problem free return. I do most all my shopping on Amazon. They treat their customers very well. I went and ordered the Champion sweats from Amazon. More expencive, but well worth it. This is my recommendation."
1,Very Unhappy,WHITE POCKETS?????Even if they are big on you the white pockets stick out...Very disappointed.
2,Not fleece,"I was expecting fleece due to the description but they were not. Also they were not true to size. I ordered this and another brand at the same time. The other one fit fine, these the large was closer to S/M. I did receive a refund but if you order these please keep in mind you will probably need to order a size up than you usually wear."
1,A very Bad Buy,This company is a farce. I've ben wearing Joe Boxer size 4XL for years and they are absolutely comfortabe. When I received the Dri-Power fleece I could not even pull them on.I recommend that no one buy
3,not bad but not great,collects dust like crazy but dries fast. it does its job for now but lets see after long term usage.
3,good,The only thing I do not like about these is the pockets are not deep enough to carry or hold anthing.
3,Drawstring broke after 1 week of use,"Great feel and comfort, i love the tight drawstring on the ankles so they dont ride up or down as easily.However the drawstring did break after one use, it snapped in the back so i was forced to remove it, and use a new drawstring which means i had to go through the painful process of feeding a new one through the hole all the way around the waistband.Good material, nice pockets, the only flaw was the drawstring, hopefully you will be luckier, im size 30 waist i bought large, it was perfect length but i like to tie the string tight so they dont sag and snap went my hopes and dreams."
4,Russell sweat pants,"quick, efficient service. The quality of the pants does not measure up to Russell sweats I have from the past. Older sweats are thicker and have a better feel to them."
3,Too small,"These fleece pants are of very good quality, but they were too small. I usually wear a xl and I should have went with the xxl. I should have paid attention to another post."
4,The fit,Nice but the 4X fit like 2X. Had to send them back. I don't know what else to say to build the word length. Easy enough return but I hate that.
4,Bit tight around the crotch,"I ordered this because I needed a new pair of sweat pants. Great quality, great price, but a little bit tight around the crotch area."
2,Comfortable but worn three times and stiching coming apart already,"Wouldn't recommend. I've worn them three times, washed them twice and the stiching is coming apart in the crotch and leg seam. I bought these to replace an identical pair I got as a gift five years ago that lasted a long time unitl the pockets ripped. Something has changed from then to now in quality or maybe I got a bad pair"
4,Acceptable,"These are not true to the color in the photo - they are a darker color like the photo for the navy. The photo for the navy heather is definitely a lighter shade of blue. They are just a little tighter on the top compared to our old Hanes of the same size, but we might have stretched those out since we have worn them for several years now. The legs seem a little longer to me. My husband and I, who wear the same size in sweat pants, both find these acceptable for fit. The color is also acceptable to both of us although not as pretty to my eye as the color I thought we were getting. The price is more than acceptable, given that we can locally only get either sweat pants without fleece for the same price, or branded fleece sweat pants for two or three times the price.There were no manufacturing flaws in any of the three pairs we received."
2,"An athletic necessity, poorly made","I need this style sweatpant for my workouts and sports. Russell used to make a quality product. Unfortunately, Russell's quality has plummeted. The drawstrings in their athletic pants now regularly snap, break, and fail, and I have to return many of these and order new ones. And there are no other companies to order them from; Champion's inexpensive models also routinely fail. I do not want to buy the professional models which cost around $45-55-75 dollars. So I am stuck ordering these and returning them when they fail. And they fail often. It wouldn't cost much more to use a higher-quality drawstring, but obviously Russell and Champion have chosen not to do this. The fabric on these pants is fine; the drawstrings are just terrible. Forewarned is forarmed."
1,worst sizing of sweat pants,"BOUGHT THESE SWEAT PANTS BECAUSE THE PRICE WAS GOOD AND I THOUGHT RUSSELL MADE A GOOD PRODUCT.DO NOT BUY RUSSELL PRODUCTS THEY ARE SIZED 3 OR 4 TIMES SMALLER THAN WHAT YOU GET.THEY ARE VERY ITCHY,NOT A FLEECE,NOT SOFT,LIKE WEARING CANVAS........DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!RGW"
1,"black ""fleece"" pants","These pants were not at all what I wanted. I thought I was getting a fluffy ""fleece"" sweatpant like a fleece blanket type material, but instead basically got plain old black sweatpants. AND....they are WAY smaller than I expected.....men's small??? I doubt it. They are still sitting on my shelf with the TAGS on them ! What a waste!"
3,Not what I expected,"The color is nice, but quality, style and texture not appealing. This item was given as a gift. Unfortunately, the receiver was disappointed. Compared to other similar fleece pants they own that are worn more often, but a different brand, are much preferred. These pants will be worn only for outdoor yard work...and not much else."
4,"Fit Well, Super Comfortable","I needed some sweats to sleep in when i go camping so i bought these. They fit great, have pockets which is nice, and the elastic is snug without being uncomfortable. The elastic is clutch because I don't want my warm air escaping when ever i move. Great quality for the price too. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a casual pair of sweats."
3,Too large,"Not Russell's fault but all reviewers said to get one size larger than you usually wuold, as they are too small otherwise.I usually take a ""large"" but on recommendation got an XL. Well the XL was too large, and trying to hold them up with the draw string caused the string to break in a couple of days. Also the material quickly started to ""pill,"" so I would not buy them again in a large. I was tempted to get a large as I liked the elastic cuff & the material is nice and thick, but the pilling killed that notion. Sorry Russell ...."
5,Dad liked them,These are a perfect weight for my dad and fit just fine. He says they are comfortable and hopefully will wash well. I'll repost if they do not.
5,comfy and even fits a girl,I've been looking for sweats that are closed ended for a girl but they just do not exist. I like these because they are comfy and baggy but still fit. Very happy with this find!
2,"Russell Athletic Men's Dri-Power Fleece Pocket Pant,Oxford,X-Large",Comfort: I believe the sizes run a size to small. The XLG in fact feels like a LG - for waist and leg circumference. The length was great. I prefer my sweats a little bulky so the XLG I ordered was too snug and I sent it back.Performance: I can't comment.
1,aquagrizz,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! If you are going for large sizes you will be disappointed. I ordered two pairs of 3XL, they were not anywhere near the size 3XL should be. My 16 yr old, 145 pound, nephew now wears them..they are his sizen (he wears large)!"
5,SUPPER PANTS,These Pants are the most comfortable things ever! I love them and if It wasn't nasty I would wear them all week long!
2,good for a month.,"I bought these pants for my boyfriend for christmas....i noticed a small tear in the ankle where there elastic is, figured it was no big deal and sewed it up for him. A month later and both ankles are full off holes. It's not like he wears these everyday, or while doing strenuous work. These are lounge around all day pants, yet somehow are falling apart after a month. Save your money and just go buy some $10 sweatpants at target or walmart."
2,Undersized,I purchased two pair of these sweatpants and tried them on upon receipt. Both pair are woefully undersized. I actually purchased one size larger than usual just in case and I should have bought at least two sizes larger. The pants are nicely done and no problems with the quality but both pair are going into my wife's gym bag and not mine.
2,Poorly made,I have bought these in the past and was basically satisfied. These new ones I bought were poorly made. The seam stitching came apart before the first washing. They fit tighter which means they are using less material.
1,Russell sweats,"I have Purchased Dri-power sweat suit a year and a half ago from the store . The product I had bought was called Dri-power . It's a great suit , it's heavy , Thick and comfortable , It's got the special mix of polyester and cotton to help keep of sweat of me . It had the embroided Russell trademark on the shirt and pants . What I bought from amazon was not what I thought I was buying. It says dri-power on it , but I could of bought these sweat pants at flea market for much cheaper , the pants were thin and ordinary it's not the real dri-power sweats I thought I was getting , I'm very disappointed , I wish I never would have bought these sweats from amazon ."
4,Just Fine,"I've been wearing Russell sweats for several years, and the only problem I've ever had is that the stitching on the pocket opening sometimes gives out after four or five years. That wasn't enough of a complaint to stop me from ordering them again. However, I was taken aback when I read some of the negative reviews and only ordered a single pair this time. The new sweats turned out to be just fine. They're just like the Russell sweats I've worn in the past except that they now sport a logo over the right pocket. They're comfortable and fit well. I plan to order more."
2,Russell using poor quality materials,"The fleece sweats arrived promptly, so the shipper did their part. The material Russell is using is of inferior quality, however, and pills severely. I suppose it has to do with profit, but companies that use poor quality material lose in the long run, as I will probably avoid other Russell products as well in the future.Russell should know that 50/50 cotton/polyester fleece just doesn't work very well. I know it, but just wasn't paying attention."
3,Look What's Happened to Rosemary's Baby,"This really isn't a bad film. The sequel actually has some suspense and a surprising twist at the end. This movie however, dosen't compare to the original great horror classic."
5,"Beautiful, elegant watch","This watch was exactly what I expected. It's simple, elegant and perfect for both dressy occasions and everyday use. The only complaint I have is that it's a bit too long. I'm going to have to get a few links taken out, but otherwise I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,patty from mich,I wanted this watch so much when I ordered it it said there was 2 in stock but as the days went by I notice that I didn't get confirmation on it so I called the company the watch is out of stock so when I went back to order the other one they didn't have it either so I missed out on this watch all because someone let my order just sit with no responce. I really wanted it but thats the way it is so needless to say I'm NOT HAPPY. When I read the reviews there was a man that said he ordered it for his wife for christmas and she never got it I wonder if that was ever taken care of or if he got his money back?
4,Excellent value for price,"I purchased this watch for my daughter. She loves it! My only issue with the purchase is that the watch didn't have an additional link in the bracelet. Otherwise, Great!"
5,Scrabble's competition,"This is an educational word game that lovers of crossword puzzles, anagrams, and scrabble will have a field day with.It exercises the mind, creates competition and expands vocabularies.Worth the money.Paul Michelin"
5,Perfect for my hedgies,I bought a bunch of these because they are the perfect( little) size for hedgehog food. I have found other bowls are too large.
2,Serta 5-Pound Memory Foam Contour Pillow,"Don't for a moment expect that you will be buying something equivalent to a Tempurpedic pillow but at a much lower price. I have a Tempurpedic pillow and was looking for a slightly larger (higher) pillow so I bought the Serta - trying to save some money. It was a great disappointment. It is soft and mushy and after using it for a couple of months there is no support at all. Next time I will pay the price for the ""real"" thing."
4,Solid night's sleep ...,... is the most notable result of this fairly solid foam pillow. It provides better neck support than my other foam pillow.
1,do not buy!!!,"This bicycle pump is terrible!!!! It cheaply made and I wish I had never bought it. I has a totally impractical hose on it that just doesn't work. It wouldn't stay in the tire gage and it's just awkward and non-functioning. It comes with several attachments to air up different things, which I thought sounded great, but it's just a piece of junk. Don't buy this product- you will be wasting your money!"
4,Cheap and Handy,This is a nice handy pump for your bike...It has different accessories for all types of tires and the shape is convenient enough for a hand pump. Its small in size and can be mounted on the bike itself or in a small hiking-bag. Enough psi pressure to fill up the tires from flat state to inflated in around 30-40 pumping. Highly recommended
4,If your in good shape,"This is a nice well built pump, but unless your young and in good shape, you can count on at least a half an hour (takes me 2 hours, have to rest) for a bicycle tire that is flat. It does not put out enough air with each pump, will not even blow out a candle. Would not even attempt a car tire.But I am going to keep it just in case. I am 78 and short of my own air, so about 20 to 30 strokes is all I can do at one time, perhaps I can find some young buck to help me if I need it.If your in good shape I would get it well worth the money."
1,You get what you pay for....,"Pump lasted all of one day. Hose had two leaks after one use!Don't bother using for anything but balls. This thing is NOT built well enough to handle any type of tires, even if you do have the strength and endurance to try it on a tire.But thank heavens for Amazon's return policy!! Money refunded, no questions asked!"
4,Love the versatility,"I already had a Zefal pump, but gave it to my sister when I gifted her my bike.Great Zefal product, I haven't used the plastic attachments for plastic items (for inflatable toys) yet, only the Schrader valve and the needle."
4,Need to redsign the Housing,"As you can see, one end looks like a small light bulb.This makes it difficult to keep it attached to the framein a secure manor. If you have a frame who's diameteris larger than normal(older Cannondale road bikes), I wouldconsider a different style pump.I think it's a quality pump, but next time I will belooking for one that is a bit shorter and narrower. After all,I'm not looking for a floor pump, but one to use inan emergency situation."
2,"Whoa, save your money","Sorry, but I just can't think of much nice to say about this book. It's a little bizarre (lemons? lemon land?), and tries to be too many things to many categories of special needs kids.My son actually got up and walked out of the room on it.The two other books I bought were way better: ""Eagle Eyes"" and ""Shelly the Hyperactive Turtle"".Writers take note, there's more room on the market for quality kids' books about ADD."
1,Reference Only,"This book will not teach you to use the MS Agent API. It simply documents it. Further, the entire content of this book is available on Microsoft's website(a fact which I was unaware of when purchasing the book). Even worse, the book is out of date with the advent of the newest release of the API(which has some good improvements). Worst of all, if you're a C/C++/Java developer using COM/ActiveX, this book is only marginally useful as a reference, as the majority of code is in VB format(leaving out important information like typing.....a trend I hope MS reverses). Save your money; go to the website."
2,Evidence Of Rushing Software,"The Microsoft Agents are great for providing audio interfacing and can be useful and entertaining. Unfortunately this book seems to have been rushed into publication and does not present a complete, clear guide to the programming of these agents. On working through the books examples I was still unable to determine how to program the Agents to receive voice input. The examples seem to have lead me to a dead end that showed my commands there but would not respond."
3,Mad Hatter's Holiday,Drama. Where is the drama? The story line moved slow and never really picked up steam. The book was short enough that I was committed to finish. I was left wondering why his supporting help did not point out this problem to him as it was proof read.
3,Odd,"This is an odd book. It took a long time to get to the point and the main character is a sleazy weirdo with an creepy ""binocular"" hobby. If you read it you will know exactly what I am talking about. Not a book I would ever pick up again and read. Plus, not sure what the title has to do with the book, other than the main character spends almost the entire book on a seaside vacation."
5,Hilarious! Insightful!,"I read this book several years ago, and could hardly put it down. Everyone I've shared it with felt the same way."
2,Ugly American,"This book provides valuable insights into what the Ugly American looks like. For that insight alone I award it one star. It is also funny in places, for which I award the second star. My 35-year work experience is in the Western corporate world and this malcontent, self-obsessed, arrogant man would have been a painful employee to have at any company in any part of the world. You actually cringe for the man as you read. The Ugly American goes to a foreign country and is inconvenienced because the people don't speak English, have different customs and worldview and cannot understand his perspective and just generally won't change their foreign ways and dance to his tune. Well, he went there expressly to learn about them, their culture, insights and world views didn't he? That he could not adapt or fit in is a failing on his part, not that of his Japanese hosts. Pshaw!"
2,"Humourous, but lacking reality neither then nor now","Having lived in Japan for several years, I found this book to be a sad assault on Japanese culture. It is definitely humourous somewhat like the movie Mr. Baseball, and certain parts did definitely happen to other foreigners in the 1980s, but overall this should not by any means serve as an introduction to Japan and its' culture."
4,Almost got it right.,"This book is quite useful.It expands on some races and reintroduces some old classics. like the Winged Elf, the water elf, the Wemic, and the centur.However it also just copies the entries for dark elves and planetouched races basically straight from the Forgotten realms campaign settingbook.They could have used the space a little better instead of repeating races that 97% of us have access to. (If you have an interest in this book then its pretty much fact that you already have the Forgotten Realms Campaign setting).Some of the region feats are nice and the a couple of the prestige classes are going to appeal to my players so for that regard it was worth the purchase price.Summing up it gathers all the races from the Realms campaign setting and adds in some new ones. Mixes in some new feats, some old ones tweaked and a few prestige classes."
3,"Helpful and informative, BUT","It should be called SOME of the Races of Faerun. The book offers a great deal of information, however it leaves gaps here and there just so it can fill them through another volume. For the price tag of this book I feel it is a bit incomplete. It could contain a lot more info on a lot more races. If you're only looking for general information on the most prominent races of Faerun, this is for you. However it should not be considered THE source of info, as it is anything but complete and thorough."
5,"A top notch book, a must-buy for any Forgotten Realms game.","This is the book I've been waiting for. As a great lover of all of the PC race books from 2nd edition, I have been waiting with baited breath for the 3rd edition version and now I have it. I'll say now I was impressed. It's very well written and put together, with in depth views of each subrace and their place in the grand scheme of the race in general, their social lives and the strictures of their societies as well as racial prestige classes, new feats based on race and lineage. It goes into detail about the different regions and nationalities of humans, the religions of each race and subrace, it's truly a credit to the writers. Bravo!"
2,Races,"The information in this book is helpful but not neccessary. I enjoyed reading about elves in this book. There is a lot of info on different regions of humans, which at first I thought would be helpful, but there is too much and it limits the creative process. The art work, and I use the term loosely, is horrid, mostly the dwarves. Do not look at the pictures. All in all I'm glad I didn't pay full price."
1,Most of this is already in print,"This draws upon previously released work and attempts to put it between new covers. If you already own the Forgotten Realms sourcebook and the other core rulebooks, you already own ninety percent of this volume. Don't throw your money away, wait for the updated players guide for the 3.5 edition."
3,Races of Faerun,"This book contridicts the Forgotten Realms book written by Ed Greenwood. The elves inpertcular.The book is put together well, but WoC should get their sources straightened out before they publish them"
4,convoluted chair pad,My Father is 90 and spends a good deal of time sitting or sleeping in a recliner. This product makes it much more comfortable for him. I would recommend this product.
2,Tooooo soft no support...,"As the title said too soft no support, would probably be fine for someone weighing 100 lbs or less. But if you're over that squishes down to nothing."
1,"Not 4""","I followed the reviews and thought I was purchasing a full 4"" product. It is only slightly over 3 inches high. I did purchase two of the pillows and like another reviewer said, they squish down so much right away, that I ended up using both for one chair. And still, it is not all that comfortable, this is hardly worth the $25 or so I spent on them both. Why cannot someone make a decent pad to sit on for upteem hours?"
1,item compressed down,"item compressed down to about 1"" thick an did not spring back to the original 4"" thickness, also the foam rubber started to split no edges after 2 days."
2,Not what I'd hoped for...disappointing,"I'd purchased this pad in hopes of making my work day more comfortable. As phone operator in Medical Imaging in a major hospital, I'm spend most of the day at a desk. Unfortunately, this pad provides minimal pressure relief. At least, it wasn't too expensive. However, I will be looking for something else."
1,Sounds like a school orchestra,"This is a disappointing CD. It reminds me of an Ed Wood movie, where they just did it in one take and left it, mistakes and all. Honestly, it sounds like the orchestra at a middle school."
4,Great soldering iron,Great soldering iron. It takes a bit to heat up but overall a great product. Wish it came with a solder tip not a chisel tip.
5,Buy quality and you produce quality,"After years of trying to use a lower level iron, I bought this one and could not be happier. Quick and even heat with decent balance."
3,Crisis time for the Nameless Detective,"After penning seven Nameless Detective novels and countless other books, short stories & novellas (some under pseudonyms), Bill Pronzini aims for a tour de force -- Nameless is confronted with three unrelated crimes to solve, all in under 200 pages! The San Francisco's PI's deductive abilities are so incredible that I admit it strained my credulity a bit. However, it's an interesting idea (usually, when a PI is faced with unrelated cases, they turn out to be linked in some way -- not so here, thank goodness) so give Pronzini credit for trying something different. The hardships faced by Nameless in this book (the loss of his professional license, trouble with his girlfriend Kerry) made me eager to proceed to Book 9 to see if there are better days ahead for our hero."
3,Bad Week for 'Nameless',"""Scattershot' is a week in the life of Bill Pronzini's ""Nameless Detective."" And what a bad week it is. He fears he's losing his girlfriend (introduced in the previous novel, ""Hoodwink""), has a crazy client's husband murdered right under his nose, and finds himself accused of both negligence AND theft. Not to mention that he hates his new office space. Overall, this edition of the Nameless series is good, but not amoung the best. Part of the problem is that the three seperate mysteries compete for time with the personal stuff in a book that's relatively brief at just over 200 pages in trade paperback form. As a result, the cases are a bit by-the-numbers and far too easilly resolved. Nameless fans will probably enjoy it, but I would recommend newcomers start with either ""Hoodwink"" or ""Shackles"" instead."
5,A strong and entertaining series continues ...,"The British Light Music Classics series on Hyperion are some of the most-played discs in my collection. I have Volumes 1-3 as well and have found all of them to be a welcome alternative for those days when you're not in the mood for the ""heavier"" classics such as Beethoven or Brahms, but are still looking for some quality music to enrich your day.The 17 selections in this volume are, if anything, a slight improvement overall from Volume 3 -- proving that conductor Rondald Corp's enthusiasm and excellent taste are still actively engaged. The New London Orchestra play all of these pieces with their usual alertness, energy, and attention to detail.In short, an excellent introduction to this wonderful series, and presented with Hyperion's usual thorough and well-written notes and attention to quality -- truly one of the classiest labels in the business and worth every penny of the somewhat stiff price.Buy and enjoy!"
2,Very disapointing,"The time period when this was recorded, 1954, was during the time that Harry James' band was looking for a new identity. The band included Willie Smith and Corky Corcoran, and was playing very well. However, due to evident time constraints that had put upon him, and to accomodate the too many vocals of Gisselle Mc Kenzie, Harry was forced to chop up his arrangements. Thus we miss some exciting solos. Nice try, but a clear miss."
2,The Probable Future by Alice Hoffman,"I was very pleased by the service of the book seller. It came quickly in the mail in the condition stated. The story, not so much."
1,"Blah, blah, blah...","Being a fan of the author, I couldn't wait to get my hands on her latest offering. What a disappointment! I agree with the reviewer who noted that there wasn't a character in the book worth caring about. I guess I felt some sympathy for Jenny Sparrow what with the horror of a daughter she had. Seems to me the author couldn't make up her mind which way she was going with this one - a mixture of ""Here on Earth"" and ""Practical Magic"" but not nearly as good as either one!"
2,"still lyrical, but ...","... when did magical become meandering? I hate to say it, but it was a chore to finish this book."
3,Magical Realism Lite,"Alice Hoffman's books have been highly recommended by friends, and after reading THE PROBABLE FUTURE I can understand the attraction of the writer's sensibility. But as a work of literature it doesn't work: it's endlessly repetitive in its descriptions (maybe an unsuccessful effort at blending the landscape with the plot), the author's character development is weak, and the plot is forced. Most important of all, THE PROBABLE FUTURE doesn't say anything new--or differently--about how we live. For successful magical realism (and for intricate links among generations of women) look up García Márquez's work."
2,Probable Boredom,"If you choose to read this anemic novel, your probable future is several hours of wasted time. The characters hold possibility, but are woefully underdeveloped, the plot is predictible, contrived, and often silly, and neither the ""magic"" nor the ""mystery"" have any depth.A small strain relating the story of 18th century Rebecca Sparrow has some interest, but the storyline concerning this character is brief. Mostly the story centers around a sullen, selfish 13 year old, her dysfunctional relatives, and her romantic fantasies. A young girl in 7th - 10th grades may enjoy this book. It is at the reading level and literary depth suitable to jr. high school."
2,Parody of Alice Hoffman,"I don't believe she wrote it! It is more believable to me that some college freshman in a creative writing class penned this dreary, repetitive tale peopled with unlikeable characters.At one point she describes a grouping of rocks where people go to make out. They get those rocks so a-sizzlin' that mosquitoes burst into flames upon landing on the rocks. I laughed myself silly - apparently human backsides are impervious to this mosquito-killing heat.I would strongly recommend you skip this particular book. Re-read Turtle Moon instead."
2,"Oh, Please! I should have stopped at 100 pages!!","I chose this book based on the premise of generations of women with special ""talents"". I was deeply disappointed in the development of this story. Alice Hoffman spent more time describing the scent of lake water, types of rain and each character's hair than she spent on the plot. Or were those things the plot?When the opportunity arose, very near the end, to add some intrigue to the story it lasted less than two pages. There was tremendous possibility, which was ignored in order to pursue the inane and weak love triangle.I found Hoffman's repetitive descriptive style to be greatly annoying. How many times does she have to say the girl's shoulder was hurt at birth, or that the horse bolted on this path? And enough about the sound of the ""peepers""!This was the first, and most likely last Alice Hoffman book I have read. What is everyone raving about???"
2,Department of Redundancy Department,"Perhaps my brain is addled by the unusual heat we're experiencing, but I felt that the same details, illusions, information, descriptions of rain, of flowers, of smells, were offered over and over again in this novel. I am a huge Alice Hoffman fan, and did indeed enjoy the powerful magic bestowed upon the characters, but as David Byrne said, ""Say something once, why say it again?"""
4,Good solid read,"I'm not a writer nor am I an expert on Alice Hoffman. I did, however, rather enjoy this book. I will admit that it took me a while (even a little re-reading) to really get into the story, but once I was engaged, I really enjoyed it. It actually made me cry at the end, so I really was moved. I found the story very heartwarming and perhaps ending a little more realistically than other Alice Hoffman novels. MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN THE RIVER KING!!"
5,Caring for a Loved One Suffering from Dementia,"This book is the best one I have read that explains what it is like to care for a loved one suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. It is thorough. It shows what often happens when family members disagree about how to care for the loved one: who should make the decisions; who will handle the inevitable expenses. This book shows the heartbreak when siblings not only refuse to share the day-to-day care--but to the shock of the author--actually fight for control of the loved one's money and her right to loving care. As is often the case, one family member ends up shouldering the entire burden.I recommend this book to anyone who is facing the struggle with how to care for a loved one who is suffering from Alzheimer's Disease."
5,Fabulous Choice of Shows,"I was planning our vacation to Los Angeles when my husband suggested we attend a taping of a TV show. I didn't know where to start looking for information so I went to the main library and asked if they had any books on attending TV shows in LA. I was surprised when they showed me ""Appearing on TV Shows for Fun, Fame & Fortune"" by Lee Ellis. It is a terrific resource. It lists over two hundred shows to be in the audience or as a contestant. We choose to the game show ""The Price is Right."" The book gives the ticket info and the way contestants are choosen. We got our tickets by e-mail and we were off to LA. When we got to the studio everything went smoothly and we were interviewed to be contestants. But,our luck was not to be, we did not hear our names announced to ""come on down"" as contestants. Even though we didn't get to be contestants it was a great experience. If any of you want to be on a game show or any TV taping, I sugguest you get this book. It helped me alot."
1,Bosch Warning,This pump died after 3 weeks. The bearing failed. Dont Buy this pump. Im out $600 in labor to change the pump twice. Avoid Bosch
5,perfect bluegrass instrumental treatments of mountain hymns,"What can I say but that it is truly a crime that Amzon refuses to stock this title regularly. Try ordering it through their used service since this CD is so worth the effort. This is a very authentic treatment of our favorite mountain hymns and includes a few not normally grouped togther. One rarely finds ""Farther Along"" on the same album as ""I'll Fly Away"" and one NEVR finds both those tunes along with the great Anti-War hymn, ""Down By The Riverside"". All three and more are here and sweetly interpretted. If you bought the soundtrack to BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? then you NEED this CD too."
5,Food as Medicine A traditional Chinese Medical Perspective,"This was a very easy to follow book with loads of information and images. I have read others, but found this book to be easy to follow and fun to read. The way it was written has alowed me to learn how to use food to suit my needs. A must have for any food lover."
3,"read the first 2/3rds, skip the rest","This book tries to make sense of the labyrinthine history and politics of Gutenberg's era, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. He does well bringing the economic and buisness realities to life, as well as the innovations needed to develop a movable type printing press. Man seems rather a charismatic lecturer and writes in that style, which grates on me. Also, his final chapters on the propagation of printing in Europe after Gutenberg lack the punch of the Gutenberg chapters and beg to be skipped by all except scholars of the period. Ultimately, mildly interesting in places, but not a keeper."
3,"Good Pictures, but boring","I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he's a car enthusiast. Anyway, I thought it would be a great present but it turns out that it was just way to boring for him. Not very exciting..."
3,Please get out of the way,"I'm sorry to have wasted my money on this CD. Maybe I don't understand what Chick is trying to do. However, I love these standards. What I hear is a piano virtuoso interfering with them. In my opinion, Mr. Corea doesn't have that much to say to warrant bending meter to say it. All his Tatumesque ornamentation is a bunch of interruptions. I wish Tatum could have recorded using modern technology. He knew how to let the standards come through. Those interested in modern interpretations should stick with Oscar Peterson, who has surprises lurking bar after bar."
5,Christmas Aroound the World coloring book,Wonderful art work depicting Christmas around the world. Lots of pages to color. My daughter loves it and enjoys coloring the pictures and showing me her work.
3,Enjoyable if you can enjoy 'em.,"I read the other review and after I read almost through the book I decide to write as a learner who've actually read this book. Beware of what others say, truth is if you are an intermediate learner, you're not gonna be able to read this book in any enjoyable way, or maybe in any way. On the other hand if you cannot go on or through with reading it, don't feel bad about yourself just because some other intermediaters get along with it like an easy buddy. Just put this book aside till your reading skill develops, and then you'll read it in an enjoyable way, or at least a comfortable way.As regard the stories themselves, they range from great to good to mediocre to irritating. Translations are in general good for its purpose though I seldom refer to them."
3,Historic Read,"It was about my hometown, which was very interesting. But if it weren't, I don't think I would have found it interesting at all."
4,Down On the Farm,"A well written book by a woman who, having been raised in the city, was not sure she wanted to be a farmer's wife. However, she fell right to work, trying her best to be just that. And for the most part she succeeded. I found it amusing that she worried so that her children, by living on a farm, would not be exposed to enough culture to grow up to be well rounded adults. I guess we farm-raised country folk just never realize how uncultured we are. Oh well, as they say, ignorance is bliss."
3,Not an easy thing to do,"I guess that when I bought this book I was looking for the quick and easy route to starting a non-profit. Well, this book sure didn't make it easy, and I resorted to working with some non-profit verterans to help me get started. There really is no easy way to start a non-profit, but this book could have been a little ""nicer"". You may want to look for a book more relevant to your state if you're not from Minestoa. However, it is very in-depth, if you have the time and energy."
3,Very informative,"This book was extremely helpful. However, it was not as good as the book by Ted Nicholas. The information contained in this book is a valuable resource tool and should be an addition to your professional library-compliments the book by Nicholas extremely well."

5,Garcia no es un extraño,"Este disco es emblematico. Los 80's comenzaban y Garcia sabia que toda la musica que tenia en la cabeza debia procesarla en otro lado y no en Buenos Aires. Se fue y grabo guitarras con Larry Carlton y respiro NYC como solo Garcia puede hacerlo. Nos abrio la cabeza a todos los jovenes (una vez mas ) y nos canto"" ... conozco esta ciudad, no es como en los diarios desde alla ...""En ""Los dinosaurios"" se anticipo al fin de la etapa mas tragica de la historia argenta y con ""Bancate ese defecto"" nos ayudo a buscar palabras para manejar la ironia "" ... no es culpa tuya si la nariz no hace juego con tu cara ...""No puedo nada mas que alabar este disco que , de principio a fin, es excelente. Tiene riffs gloriosos y todos los tracks son obras maestras.A agregarlo en Wish List y luego, comprarlo sin dudas."
5,You MUST have this book if going to Tokyo!,"Humerous and informative, ""Tokyo Pink Guide"" is a definative study of the current ""entertainment"" activities commonly available in Metropolitan Tokyo. It not only specifies exact areas and locations, but describes,in detail, protocols and cultural eccentricities.Remember, Japan is predominately Buddhist and Shinto. Unlike Western faiths, the myriad personal relations between humans are not verboten in ""proper society"". Ergo, life is more casual and relaxed, and without the stigma that we experience in America.I'd love to see a Part 2!"
1,A load of tripe.,"Other than the maps guiding people to the major red light zones of the Kanto area, 90% of the information in this book is pure fiction and/or wishful thinking. All you need to know about night life in Tokyo can be had for the price of a little conversation at virtually any pub or bar in Tokyo. As an aside, the author's unjustly slanderous treatment of the Library bar in Ogikubo caused the owner to shut the doors as hordes of thrill seekers invaded his (up to that time) peaceful little corner bar. If you have purchased this book, don't bother looking for the Library, 'cause it's gone.If you want a good book, get Nicholas Bournoff's ""Pink Samurai"" instead."
3,Felicity Lott Summertime,"Dame Felicity Lott has released a new CD on the Champs Hill Records label entitled Summertime. It's a perfectly fine CD. There's something here for everyone - French, German, and English songs. I especially liked Notre Amour, Daffodils and of course, the title track, Summertime. She is accompanied by Graham Johnson. This CD has the right mixture of songs for a lazy summer afternoon."
5,Simple and Easy to use,"My wife, who is in film school, can not afford to pay anyone to write music for the films that she makes. That is why I bought Soundtrack. There are thousands of free loops and sounds to pick from. And if that is not enough you can import other sounds and loops from other web sites or music that I have recorded, i'm an even poorer musician. Now she makes the films and I score them, when she does not have time to.The learning curve is small. I was using Soundtrack in no time. i'm now scoreing films for my friends and other fellow film students. You have to try to mess up. Just put the loop where you want it and Soundtrack will do the rest. Even change the key, or tempo so you don't have to.This is just an amazing program. I would say this is prefect for anyone."
2,Poor....,"This game collection of Sonic is not that fun. It's full of old games with very poor graphics and sound. I bought this game for my kids and they don't enjoy it very much (they almost never play with it). If you really love Sonic, then there are other games better than this. Don't lose money and time with this game."
4,Here are the games included in this collection.,"The 3 main games:Sonic the Fighters (Originally on the Arcade)Sonic CD (Originally on the Sega CD)Sonic R (Originally on the Sega Genesis)The 6 extra GameGear games:Sonic SpinballSonic The Hedgehog 2Sonic The Hedgehog Triple TroubleSonic Drift Racing 2Tails' SkypatrolTails AdventuresThe 2 extra non Sonic games:Vectorman (Sega Genesis)Vectorman 2 (Sega Genesis)(Note: In the Japanese version of this game, Vectorman and Vectorman 2 are replaced with Streets of Rage, Streets of Rage 2, and Streets of Rage 3.)"
5,"Sonic this, Sonic that.",My brother is a HUGE Sonic fan. All he ever talks about is Sonic. That's why our dad gave him Sonic Mega Collection for Cmhristmas. P.S. Why does he like Sonic so much?
2,These are considered gems..?,"I gave this disc a rental and was extremely disappointed with the content. The six game gear titles are an automatic waste of space, and Sonic: R and Sonic the Fighters are decent for archival value but don't really hold anything that will keep players coming back for more. Sonic CD is actually quite fun, but time travel function aside it's not terribly different from the early Sonic games which can be found on the Sonic Mega Collection. You can unlock the old Vectorman games as well, and they do add a bit more value to this package.If you're looking for classic 2D Sonic gaming, the Mega Collection is the compilation to check out. Hardcore fans will like what Sonic Gems has to offer, but the content is too dated and shallow to recommend to anyone else."
5,interest,"I would like to purchase Mr Smiths Albums ""cascades"" and liquid sounds"" do you have/or can you get them --I believe they were recorded at Capital Records.thank youPeter Katevatis"
2,Right product...previously opened package,"This box of staples arrived well packaged from Amazon, but the box had obviously been previously opened. Many of the strips of staples are broken. Probably still usuable, but will increase the risk of misfire. Returned products should not be sold as new."
3,slow delivery,It shouldn't take 12 days for delivery of a product from time of purchase especially at retail price.
1,WACK,WRONG SIZE WRONG SIZE WRONG SIZE AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE PEOPLE THAT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING !!!!!!
4,I love the product,"the only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that I think they are price gouging, but what company doesn't. I have owned this product before and never had problems with it. normal liquid soaps and shampoos do great, I do not know how it performs with exfoliants like ""apricot scrub""at first you feel it dispenses too little but you quickly adjust to and learn to appreciate the control the small ammounts gives since because it is adhered to the wall very well you can easily pump 2+ times per second and it is still way faster and easier than opening a bottle, pouring, closing the bottle."
2,"good idea, bad execution","The dispenser seems to work well when properly installed and primed, but filling this dispenser is another issue.First, there is no way to sit the bottle down. It does not have a flat base. It you lay it on its side, it leaks.Second, weak plastic. The seams are weak. I have had two fail (crack) from using the pump and another fail from falling over during filling.Third, the holder can be difficult to open. The latch is poor, the lid doesn't open smoothly, and it won't stay open on its own.Forth, the mechanism that holds the bottle in the dispenser can launch the bottle, if great care isn't used. Even harder when the bottle is wet and/or soapy.I would get another style of dispenser."
4,shampoo dispenser,I purchased this and it worked fine for about a month then the plunger on one went bad. was unable to return it as I didnt keep my receipt. so i had to throw it out. keep your receipts .
3,Hush Puppies,"I was expecting the slipper fit I had with my first pair of Hush Puppy slippers. Didn't get the fit, the new slipper is narrower and longer than the previous ones. If they stretch out a little, definately will be more comfy but could have ordered a size smaller."
5,"Comfortable, works well","This mouse pad is comfortable, and it's covered with an attractive, smooth, silky fabric. The wrist rest is soft but firm. I like it!"
4,Nice Pad,"I love the look of the mouse pad and the gel rest is very comfortable. The gel part is a little higher than I would have liked, but the gel part is soft and comfortable so my wrist rests pretty comfortably and doesn't hurt like it used to. I am very pleased with the pad overall."
1,From Stalingrad to Kursk,"The Russian Front: From Stalingrad to KurskThe footage is excellent, audio stinks. The replacement dvd was just as awful as the first I returned. The main narration is very low, impossible to hear, Prof.Erickson sounds like he's in an echo chamber. I would like to complete the series, but this episode is defective."
1,Boring...couldn't finish book,"I'm the type of reader that can usually plow through a boring book, especially if I already spent time to reading half of it. (I read the other Amazon reviews) But I couldn't force myself to wasting anymore time to it-it wasn't getting any better. There is hardly any magic in it, the writing is stilting, the corporate intrigue boring and hardly any romance. (maybe it got better the 2nd half) There was WAY too much corporate intrigue going on-I'm just not the type of reader that enjoys that. I enjoy love, fantasy, magic, action and romance. ! However, it did have interesting premises with family members and loved the interactions with the cats!"
5,"Pricey - But, Needed To Really Square Away Appearances","I put some Gladiator tracks on my garage walls, which I love. But, they looked a bit 'rough' on the edges. These end caps are not cheap, but you need them to really square away the appearance of your geartracks. So, I coughed up the dough to get everything squared away.They do take away about a little bit of track on the ends, and they can not be used if you have your geartracks stacked on top of one another."
2,Overpriced,"These do provide a finished look to your Gladiator Geartracks. But man, are they pricey. I just can't see how one of these could be 2 bucks. They should come in 6 to 10 packs for 1 dollar per end cap (at the most.) I still think Gladiator could turn a profit on that."
5,For musicians from the old guard!,The Eslava Solfege Method is the traditional and proven way of learning music by singing and counting with a movement of your hand as you go along. This method of learning to read music while training your ear to recognize the different intervals as you go through the lesson was (and is)an excellent way to master both skills.
5,Very well made,"This is our first pot rack, and I must say that this one is well made. Comes with four chains and 4 mounting hooks so you can hang it as shown with 2 chains on one hook or with each chain on its own hook. I screwed all four into my ceiling so that the rack would maintain balance better when taking items off of it. Took less than an hour to install with a cordless drill and stud finder. It is made in China but is very sturdy and could not imagine ever needing anything more. We have over a hundred pound on this thing right now and it holds up fine."
5,Pot holder,Old Dutch International Rustic Rectangular Pot Rack with HooksI love this. It was larger than expected and holds everything I have neatly. Would recommend each time. It looks nice as well.
4,Great storage,It was not easy to get this one installed. It took my son at least 5 hours to find the studs and had to place a piece so he could hand it. I like it very much now that it's up but it was a half days work.
1,Old Dutch Pot Rack,"I ordered this item back in August, I have yet to receive it and it now looks like it will be DECEMBER before it arrives. Item says in-stock, WELL SHIP IT ALREADY!Old Dutch International Rustic Rectangular Pot Rack with Hooks"
5,girl power!,"I have loved this book for as long as I remember! I always read it to my daughter, who felt empowered by the character."
2,"condition not satisfactory, delay in shipping","Sirs:Other than the fact that I couldn't understand the reason for the length of time required to send the book, their description of its condition didn't warrant the cost, not to mention the shipping charges.'Description from e-mail sent by seller: A used ex-library copy. Library markings. Pages are worn. Cover worn with creases. Worn edges and corners. Binding solid and tight.Reason for returning: I intend to look elswhere for this book, where I don't have to pay the price the seller wants.I am returning the book in the package it was sent today.Kurt Munz"
4,Refreshing perspective,"Dr. Harris' book, based on his original research, depicts a refreshingly positive and diverse view of masculinity, without downplaying the stresses and problems of the male sex role. The best part of the book may be the numerous excerpts of interviews conducted with men from diverse backrounds."
3,Half-great Pentangle,"This album offers five great songs: Sally Free & Easy, No Love is Sorrow, People on the Highway, Willy O' Winsbury, and Jump, Baby, Jump--original tunes all, except Willy.After Basket of Light (their 3rd album), Pentangle began to focus much more on traditional songs--and, for some odd reason, they abandoned their trademark jazz-inflected approach to trad songs, and began to render them in a rather stiff fashion--a sad shift from the band's early originality and verve. This trend was interrupted by isolated tunes on Cruel Sister, Solomon's Seal, and Reflections--exceptions that make these last three albums worth pursuing, but not essential. To my ears, the first three albums--titled Pentangle, Sweet Child, and Basket of Light--represent the band's apogee."
5,Great Pentangle,"This is IMO a 'shouldn't miss' Pentangle album. It's trueit's not as 'jazz exploratory' as some of their early ones(also all great-- SWEET CHILD is maybe my favorite folk album ever). It continues & in some ways intensifies the 'Appalachian' aspects of REFLECTION, but with slightly rawer sound (well, for Pentangle) & Bert Jansch is featured a bit more here. Jacqui MacShee's singing is terrific too. REFLECTION should also be rereleased-- but this is very welcome after 30 years of oblivion. Only minus-- I wish they'd added some 'alt. takes' or 'archival stuff' as album IS short. Don't be discouraged by some comments/reviews that the group was 'tired out' by this point--true they broke up soon after, but this has great energy I think."
4,It keeps getting better,"This third arc by Brian Michael Bendis is not a strong as the previous two, but it's still a lot better than what anyone else can do. Picking up where volume 5 left off, Daredevil's secret identity has been outed to the public. Even though it can't be proven, and he denies it the whole time, Matt Murdock's life comes under the microscope from everyone including the F.B.I. If that wasn't enough, we're introduced to Milla Donavan, a blind woman and possible new love interest for Daredevil. Also, the Owl comes back on the scene, looking to fill the role of Kingpin of crime. This time, he's selling MGH, or mutant growth hormone, the hottest illegal drug on the street. There's just one dangerous side affect: it turns all the users in super-powered maniacs who can't control themselves. How can Daredevil break up this drug ring, and put away the Owl when everyone is watching his every move?"
2,works but poor quality,the seams came apart the first game I super glued them back together and they are working but not impressed
1,baby travel,Out of 3 books i bought on how to travel with a baby. This one was the least helpful off the 3. It lacked any real information on equipment and packing etc. I found a relatively new book 'Traveling with a baby' to be a bit more informative.
2,Unhappy,"The carafe fit my machine correctly but when I pour coffee, coffee leaks from the back of the lid all over."
1,Not Cleanable,"The lid to the carafe harbors remnants from previous batches of coffee. It can not be positively cleaned. The only thing the user can do is go through many cycles of pouring hot water in, shaking the heck out of it, and hoping that visual inspection of what comes out during the shaking is a good indication of how clean it really is.For what it's worth, every drop of coffee this maker produces touches all of the inner surfaces of that lid.One other thing: it dribbles about as much as it pours."
2,"Not so hot, and pours poorly","The GOOD: it still ""works"", unlike the several Cuisinart coffee makers I've been unfortunate to own.The BAD: it doesn't work very well. It doesn't keep coffee hot for long (under two hours), and when it's less than half full it 's likely to spill when pouring because it must be held nearly upside down. Worse yet, coffee (tea, whatever) gets trapped in the top, where it's very difficult to clean."
3,Not like a thermos. Will only keep coffee hot for 2 hours max.,"This is a well constructed carafe and it looks really nice. However I was looking for a thermal carafe that will keep coffee hot enough to drink for 5 or 6 hours. This will only keep the coffee hot for 1.5 to 2 hours. The problem is that it's stainless steel inside and out, with foam insulation in the middle, but it's not a thermos-type vessel with glass inside and a vaccuum seal between the glass and the outside. I returned this and bought another caraffe that was like a thermos inside and it keeps the coffee really hot for 8 to 10 hours."
4,Super fast delivery,Ordered this on amazon after searching lot of stores for a replacement carafe. Received it faster than original expected date. not able to give 5 stars as the carafe doesn't keep the coffee hot. I still need to microwave it after pouring the coffee in a cup. But the benefit is its unbreakable.
4,Durable,Bought this as a replacement for a glass carafe that we broke. Works well although doesn't seem to keep the coffee super hot like the glass one.
4,"Would like to love it, but I like it...","I own the Cusinart DCC-1200 which has a glass carafe. Purchased this thermal carafe after breaking my 3rd glass one.This thermal carafe is hands down better than the glass carafe for durability and insulation.My 2 gripes - the insulation is not great, coffee goes to tepid after an hour even if left on the burner- the carafe is not submersible, it fills up with water between its thermal walls (even in the dishwasher) and then drips everywhere including into your cup of coffee.""Like it"" since I began carefully hand washing (with a brush, opening on top is small) and leaking stopped"
4,good but no water level indicator,"The carafe is solid and keeps coffee fairly hot, but there is no water quantity indicator so you need to use a measuring cup which is a nuisance. Although I recently bought a newer version of the Cuisinart coffee machine, and the reservoir on it has a water measure stick inside it ....it's hard to use but once you get used to it, you can read the level."
4,10 cup not the 12 ...,"Works well. No issues in ordering, arrived quickly and as ordered. My only issue is my own fault- I ordered a 10 cup instead of the 12 and set it to auto brew 12 cups - didn't realize I had ordered the smaller size till I came downstairs in the morning and it had overflowed."
1,Cannot rate item came damaged.,I will rate this item after I receive a new one I ordered - this particular item came damaged.
1,Leave Rosemary alone.,"Rosemary Clooney gets better and better and better-so very disappointing to hear her being ""harmonized"" with by Mr. Pizzarelli. Totally inappropriate and drab, and distracting from the amazing Ms. Clooney.Wish I could edit out everything but her voice....Too late."
2,Flat and Lackluster,"I'm a big fan, of Ms. Clooney, especially of her work with the LA Jazz Choir and the Basie band. This CD is not one of her best, by far. The selections, while adequately performed, were without enthusiasm and variety. The guest artists added some life, but the almost monotone rendering of these tracks did not do justice to her style, skill and potential. They certainly did not live up to the fine sounds and feel of the real music of Brazil."
1,Break Out the No-Dose,"This album has some good moments, but totally lacks energy. The combination of the two artists doesn't seem to flow together. For this album, the sum is less than the parts. Jonn's guitar playing is one highlight but there are too few highlights. His singing, I can do without."
1,This is a collection of Brazilin music that some will like,"This collection of songs has been a rather big turn off to me. As you might guess, it is heavy laden with guitar playing which is what this music is susposta sound like.I guess in a nut shell the primary reason for my lack of interest with this cd, is the numerous duets that Rosie sings with John Pizzarelli. I would have preferred no duets or just a limit of say one. Also I felt like some of the arrangements didn't work.As usual Rosie's voice was a bright spot. She knows how to always keep her voice in peak form. A big applause for this!I would not buy this cd again, sorry!"
4,Well played and well done,"I picked this CD up after listening to a few tracks. Rosemary Clooney's voice has aged, but her phrasing has only improved. After repeated listenings I am especially impressed with her readings of the songs. Loved her duet with Diana Krall. John Pizzarelli is very good. Was knocked out by ""How Insensitve""--a beautiful, quite rendition."
5,"Soothing, silky music",I am about to order a second cd for myself and intend to give this as a gift to my best friends. I love the depth of Clooney's voice and the selection of tunes. When I play it I am instantly relaxed - the songs are familiar and yet interpreted freshly. I love every track.
4,Ok but i think thats enough!,"Pwei have been my Favourite band for a long time but I am sick of seeing a greatest hits released almost every year. If only they would release a DVD or something new.This CD features alot of their old songs that are impossible to find now, so thats probably the best thing about it but on the whole if you have the singles or a greatest hits album than i think this is really pointless, the album comes with a poster which will probably be the best way into bribing you to buy it.And a couple of photos of their T-shirts on the insleeve. I suggest if your a collector to buy this or if you are a die hard fan, or if you miss Pwei, or if you haven't got their earlier stuff or want to get to know who they are. Other than that its the same basic greatest hits no remixes and some packaging a poster plus a more in depth review on the insleeve, plus a couple of photos on the insleeve. Man my grammar is really poor lol!"
4,Educating Yourself About Education,"The 3 R's have undergone an incredible transformation in the past few years as old concepts of teaching have given way to experimental methods that sometimes backfire (phonics, for example) All contemporary educators will find this bibliographic reference to primary sources invaluable in their efforts to accommodate modern techniques with traditional approaches. This book covers books written between 1990 and 1998, but texts of older yet still valuable materials are also included. Librarians, teachers, and educational administrators will find a wealth of information in this comprehensive book."
5,Nice set of pens for my art quilts,"Fabricmate is good set of fabric markers. The pen's tip create brush-like effect, which nice and different from other fabric pens. I use them in my art quilts and they produce very good results. The edges of the color are not sharp, it is less obvious that a fabric marker was used to enhance the color. The colors are nice, they do not run, and have no unpleasant odor when they are being used as some other permanent pens.I have gone through several sets of these pens, they last me about a year after which they dry out."
2,Not very useful information,"This book was of very little use to me. I was looking for something that would explain the different uses of acrylic and how to use different techniques to achieve different outcomes but there isn't enough detail to get much help from it. Also, I wouldn't do most of the painting styles so it is hard to take anything useful from them."
3,I felt like I wasted my money,I think that I may have been put off by the artwork chosen because I found it dreary. I really learned very little.
2,Redundant,There is nothing new in this book. It is a rather pedestrian approach to painting with acrylics...redundant.
3,Has parabens,"Would have given this 5 stars, but it contains parabens. It works great on my daughters hair, but I will discontinue using it due to the parabens."
2,Tangled my Hair,"This stuff tangled my hair. I'm not sure what i did wrong, but it gives such a profound buildup of product that i wasn't even used to that i just KNEW i could only attribute it to this hair lotion. Suffice to say it didn't help with detangling, and it dried my hair out and made it feel cakey. Ended up havin to wash my hair out the next day. I used it with water, so i don't know if that was the problem or what, but it was a little disappointing considering that others had given it good reviews."
5,Absolutely AMAZING,I just went natural about 9 months ago and I looked everywhere for a product that would help keep my hair moisturized without being sticky or smelly! THis product is amazing. I love it so much! Everyone should try this!
5,Stevie played like he knew time was short.,"I had this video for about a year. I lent it to friend and never got it back, that is probably an indication of how good it is. As a blues guitarist myself, I only wish this video had more close-in camera work of Stevie's hands as he played. His technique was absolutely unbelievable. He used very heavy gauge strings which he pushed to the limit and his aggressive yet unfathomably accurate fingers are still without parallel today. Seeing all of his videos on one tape gives the viewer a true appreciate of the depth and breadth of this man's talent."
3,"Everything is fine, except stains nearly on every page.","I just got the book. It is just what I want. However I find there is a stain nearly on every page. It is annoying.Now, I am in China and can't send the book back for refunding. Anyway, in most cases, stains didn't hinder my reading. Please investigate this in case others meet the same problem as me in the future."
3,Predictable plot with minimal 90s culture,"Have to admit, this book starts in a most original way: some St. Louis slackers go to Lollapolluza, listen to grunge music, drink beer and get into a car wreck. Lots of 90s band names and mid-90s culture in the first chapter. Makes an 80s kid feel right at home. One can't exactly expect an author to keep this stream of 90s references throughout the entire book, but it should be heavily peppered with references... which is one big disappointment. It's not peppered with fun references to 90s pop culture. Rather, it's just a bit here and bit there. A further disappointment is the plot. While it may start off interesting, it soon slides into predictability as you tag along with some weakly motivated characters. The sometimes humorous dialogue and silly thoughts kept me going when the plot was running its predictable course."
3,Great book ... until the end.,"I thought this book was great and it kept me up late into the night reading. However, the ending was illogical and stupid. I would have given the book 5 stars if the ending was anywhere near as good as the rest."
4,Don't Be Cruel,"This book is as cruel to the reader as the three characters Chris, Anna and Mr Chicago are cruel to Alec, the main character. The surprise ending turned my guts inside-out. Chris, Anna and Mr Chicago all have reasons to justify how they have treated Alec, and Alec is even convinced that he may have deserved it (I personally hope that Alec is plotting his revenge). In the end, I think that Alec is by far the better person of any of them. I'm not sure, but I think the leson of the story is that any amount of cruelty can be justified. I rated this book as high as I did because it made me think long and hard about what had happened."
4,Whoof....knocks the wind out of ya,"Steele has brought news skills to bear in this work, bringing a real emotional content to his work. This is a sprawling, immense future he shows us only a corner of, but hinting at the whole. His solar system, down the road a piece from his ""near-space"" timeline, is almost Besterian in its cultural chaos...and as always it seen though the eyes of drug-crazed misfits...can't wait ofr Steele's next in this era of weak sf."
3,"Interesting book, but the ending was....","The angry reader's review was an interesting summation of the somewhat disappointing ending the Steele suddenly 'slapped' in there, as the angry reader put it. I don't know, I did like the book and the long explanation of Alec's situation, but the ending was definitely an anti-climax. That Alec would stay on 'The Andy Garcia' for 70 years while tending to the dewars was disappointing for sure. Alec's MINN, Chip, was quite a funny presence, and the Superiors in the novel were engaging as well. I think that Alec's transformation from spoiled rich 'kid' to 'hero' (as the back of the paperback said), was impressive in its own right. However, I failed to see how Alec was a 'hero' in the end, and once again, Steele should have thought harder about it. Oh well...."
3,Don't expect a playmat per say...but still nice!,"When I ordered the Busy Bee playmat, I did not pay attention to the size of the playmat. I just thought it was a great playmat for my baby to lie on and play.Unfortunately, when it arrived, it was much smaller than I imagined, and there was no way my baby could lie and crawl on it! So now I use it folded in a triangle shape, and my baby plays with it in the car! It is soft, and colorful, with many textures to play with.I still had to buy a other playmat where my baby can now exercise his crawling skills!"
2,Be CAREFUL of sharp velcro on this toy!,"A cute toy (bright and cheery), but FLAWED construction. Be careful of the various small pieces of velcro on this toy!! Some of the pieces are REALLY sharp/rough!! My 7 month-old really gouged/scratched her face up by just playing with the toy normally on the floor. After this occured, I had to remove all the little velcro pieces with a seam ripper."
4,Bright colors keep baby's attention,"This playmat has two sides, one features mostly black and white with some colored patterns and textures while the other side has brightly colored pictures and the flower in the middle has a squeaker. The playmat can be used folded into a triangle or laid flat or hung from wherever you and baby would like. I used the mat in the playpen and now I use it on the floor in the triangle fold for my son to crawl toward. Also, great to hang on backseat for baby to stare at."
2,A bit small,"I was a bit disappointed because of size. It's a lot smaller than I expected, but that may be my fault for not looking at the dimensions. It's cute, but I really needed something bigger for my 4 month old grand-daughter."
4,Babies love it!,"This is not a playmat per say, not that big. But it is great visual stimulation for the infants in my child care. I have it hanging beside my diaper changing station and it does get their attention while I am changing them. Vibrant rich colors and just plain cute - I like to look at it too!"
4,Good mat but it's not a floor playmat!,"I bought this mat having read the reviews and therefore I knew that I was buying something small - and it is! The description does not provide the dimensions and I haven't measurned it but it is about a one quarter of the size of a normal floor playmat.I would also say that the quality could be a little better.Having said all that it is a very useful toy that can be taken everywhere. It's easy to hang in the car and provides entertainment for the journey. We currently have ours hanging on the side of our ""pack and play"". Jack loves the mirror on one side and the noise from the sun flower when you press it.The folding ablility and the fact there are different features on each side is also great - lots of black and white for really young babies and colors on the other side as they get a bit older.As an addtional toy, and not a 'playmat' per se, I think this is a great buy."
3,Good price for a so-so product,"I purchased this about a year ago and I was fairly happy with it when it arrived. The comforter is soft and the colors are good, but the sheets are a bit stiff.After about six months of gentle use, the comforter has lost alot of it fluffiness and the seams started to come apart -- just two approx 5-6 inch openings which I fixed.I had looked at the more expensive version at the well known Online/catalog ""teen"" store, but I chose this for the price. I have since purchased a girls set from the online ""teen"" store, and the quality far surpasses this -- so you get what you pay for."
4,AO Safety 90028 Professional Faceshield,"Haven't used this much yet. Seems to be good quality, easy to assemble, very affordable, and will offer the protection advertised. Remains to be seen how much the shield will fog up in high humidity or cold weather, but I'd expect that to be the only possible shortfall."
4,Excellent Item,It is something I needed to be able to protect my face while wearing eye glasses.This is a good option but a minor problem is that the headband is not very secure
2,Spend more for a better face shield,I can't recommend this item because the plastic head strap broke shortly after purchasing. I would think 3M could do better but I guess this is a case of you get what you pay for. Purchased a better one for a little more money and it is holding up fine. For safety sake don't be stingy.
4,Serves it's purpose well,"This Item gives you full face coverage as opposed to just eye protection when wacking weeds. With the eye protection only, I would still get rocks and debris kicked up into my face from the string trimmer. It is very light weight, so it's ok for extended use. The opening at the bottom allows for adequate airflow so you won't feel claustrophobic. To close off the opening just slightly tilt your head forward."
5,Faceshield,Excellent faceshield. I use it frequently cutting and grinding metal in my shop. Lower price than available in national hardware stores.
2,Did not last,"Purchased this product just about a year ago.One thing that I did not like was that it did not have the ratchet mechanism to tighten the head strap, instead it had the style of hole and button that you find on cheap 'one size fits all' hat.The second thing I did not like is that it did not like to stay up and out of the way when you wanted to get a clean look at something, and there was no way to increase the stay up tension. You would lift the shield and it always flopped back down unless you tilted it all the way up, but then one size fits all strap was not strong enough to keep it on your head.Today I went out into my shop and the head band had split in two around one of the front pivot bushings. It failed just sitting on the bench, well at least it did not pop off in the middle of doing some work."
4,Great for weedwacking,"Weedwacking is more dangerous than it seems. I've had small rocks, tree bark, dog poop and frog parts splatter across my face. I learned quickly to keep my mouth shut but safety glasses were only protecting my eyes. Besides that, they had a tendency to fog up. For 12 bucks I figured I'd try a full face shield and I'm glad I did. This doesn't fog up and protects most of my face without getting too much in my way. When I stop to take a short break, I can pivot the shield up. It stays on my head nicely and the strap hasn't come undone like I feared it would after a while. I've been using it for weedwacking and chainsawing for two months and think it will at least last through summer. And it doesn't look too dorky...no more than safety goggles...but I'd rather use this than be a cool one eyed weed wacker with frog guts up his nose."
1,Poor quality headband,"I had this a few months, wore it maybe a dozen times. I liked it. I wear a XXXL hat and this fit fine.One day it rolled off my work bench and landed on the headband causing it to break. The headband is neither replaceable nor repairable. End of story."
2,If only the Script could have been buried...,"Living in Green Bay, I was excited to see the video. But excitement soon turned to pain. The acting and film work were really good, but the script was horrible. Not only wasn't it believeable in any sense, but it wasn't scary either. You knew what was going to happen. So, you don't get scared because it is believeable and you don't get scared because it isn't surprising. What's the point. There were just so many faults with the script - that no matter how good the camera work, acting, or directing were, it was painful to watch. How does a crappy script get the necessary money to be produced?"
4,Pretty crafty and worth watching for sure,"Project Solitude was creative and kept me entertained. I watched it with 2 friends and we enjoyed it. Different yes, but entertaining and cool definately."
5,LOVED it!,"Let me start off by saying Eric Roberts is a genius and easily one of the most underrated actors today. I caught ""Project Solitude: Buried Alive"" at a film festival and was blown away. This movie is very well done and incredibly suspenseful -- not just by independent standards, but by ANY standards. The production value is flawless, the writing is engaging and the cast performances are spot on. Highly recommended film!"
2,And yet there is an inexplicable fondness...,"Oh, Eric Roberts. Do you actually turn down any scripts, ever? It's reached the point where your name on the cast list is as good as Lance Henrikson's at being an indicator of a terrible movie with halfway decent video production values and one cast member who, while subsisting purely on a diet of scenery and trying not to wink at the audience, can actually act."
4,"""You put the mic in the wrong hands & ya get me...""","This is hands down one of Esham's best albums to date. Judgement Day Vol. 2 features some of his most well-known classics from over the years. Take a look at his Acid Rain Greatest Hits album & you'll see quite a few tracks from this LP on there. The album features classics like ""Play Dead"", ""Finger In The Cake Mix"", ""Wake The Dead"", ""13 Ways"" & ""Dyin 2 Be Down"". Esham was at his best on this album. I recommend this disc to any fan of old Esham or any juggalo who wants to know what his wickidest ish was: THIS IS IT!Also DON'T SLEEP ON THE RETURN OF THE WICKED SH*T! ESHAM IS BACK ON APRIL 19th WITH HIS NEWEST ALBUM 'A-1-YOLA'. THIS WILL MARK THE RETURN OF HIS OLD SCHOOL WICKEDNESS! DON'T SLEEP ON IT!"
3,Broke AGAIN,"Seriously? It's not as broken as the mirror it was replacing, but man these things are stupidly easy to break, all I did was fold, and the when I tried to unfold it, SNAP, now the stupid thing doesn't stay rigid. I am so tired of these things, why are they made this badly? Otherwise, mirror is reflective, and the paint is nice, not chipped, matches the other mirror.I'd say if you don't want to ever fold your mirror, get it!"
2,superficial and dispersed,"Tries to cover ""all popular models"" from 45 to 03, ending up with 5 pages of mostly pictures for a spring over on a CJ. Very superficial treatment of complex issues. Secondly, a lot of the ""solutions"" offered are very expensive, hand in hand with the clearly listed suppliers of big bucks items."
5,"be a jew because God said to be a Jew, not to be a better missionary","Argues convincingly that Yeshua-following Jews are called to be Jewish because God commanded them to be and not for any missionary motivation. One of the best books around for digging into the sociological and theological setting of the intra-Jewish and Gentile issues of the first century, and their implications for the Church. While this book is very important for the Church, it needs further clarification and so we wait for more from Kinzer and/or from others in dialog with him."
2,Its was a cool toy but,"Its a nice toy i bought it for a friend. But they said it was a 10"" toy but in fact it's a 6.5"" they need to change the dis. other than that it's good"
5,"A superbly organized, practical, accessible ""how-to"" guide","Expertly and knowledgeably written by educational film maker and business communications expert Lisa A. Smith, Business E-Mail: How To Make It Professional And Effective is a solid, ""user friendly"" guide to making the best use and utilization of Internet email for business related purposes. From learning to phrase messages that are alert, easily understandable, direct, useful, and appropriate, to keeping one's messages within company guidelines, Business E-Mail is a superbly organized, practical, accessible ""how-to"" guide and very highly recommended reading for every business organization from a one-man shop to an international conglomerate with e-mail as an integral part of their daily operations in today's computer age."
5,Just what I was looking for,I wanted something that was concise and to the point regarding business email. The information provided was practical and easy to understand. The author provided good information on sentence structure and email etiquette. I recommend this book.
2,Useful tool but ... too many mistakes,"Overall the book is a useful tool to refresh some basic and not so basic vocabulary skills. However, the number of spelling errors and other editing errors is appalling for a test prep book. The mistakes definitely weaken the overall reliability of the book."
3,A little cheesy with a few laughs,"From previous reviews I expected kind of a Marx brother's type movie. Although there was a lot of different things going on the jokes were a bit lame and the acting, and over-acting, somewhat campy."
5,RADIOLAND MURDERS,"As previous reviewers have stated, this movie brings back those days, before TV, when being entertain at home in the evenings was listining to the radio, and ones own imagination. I, for one enjoyed the movie, seeing the sound effects be made and trying to figure out who was doing the killings.If you like these old movies, I am sure you would enjoy this one."
2,Good movie...Bad DVD,"I enjoyed watching the movie. It was pretty much as funny as it was the first time I saw it when it came out. I purchased the DVD because I couldn't find it anywhere to rent. However, the DVD itself was postage stamped (black bars on the sides and on the top and bottom). It was not a true widescreen format DVD. By the time I made all the necessary adjustments to ""fill the screen"" the pixels were very noticeable, which really hurt the movie's picture quality."
3,Radioland Murders,"I thought this movie was not main stream, and was well written. If you hate those movies that crittics and main stream Hollywood try to slam down your throats and call it a brillant cinamatic masterpeice, then this a refreshing change of pace for you. Yes it was campy, and, no it wasn't Forrest Gump or Titanic (which I thought they weren't even worth the paper they were written on), but a movie that you can curl up with some popcorn and escape for a few hours. I loved the characters, I loved the idea, and it was an alround good story that was never given a chance."
1,Some girls dance with women but I don't wanna listen!,"Ewwww, this song's lyrics are so nauseating. I really don't want to know about ""throwin' back drinks"" and why girls dance with women and that Mr. Chasez wants to get in with them. Besides, in this setting, girls CAN'T dance with women, or men or at all because they can't GET INTO the Club becasue they are not 21!UHHHGGG!!! This is just as bad as Britney's ""Do Somehting"", well I did, I turned off that awful song.I am not doggin' on this just to bash. I DO like Nsync and Britney but sometimes they just strike out!"
2,pretty disappointing,"These bags are just not well designed. there are several pockets that are pretty much unusable because of how they are arranged. The holder for the speed square is very awkward, which is irritating because I think i reach for that more than any other single tool. Also, there are no small sleeves for tools like pliers, screwdrivers, punches, and so on. Finally, I've been using these for about 4 months of constant use, and they are already falling apart in certain places. I definitely will not buy them again."
5,One of Kevin Aucoin's favorite makeup books,"For a good reason-- Bandy is a true artist who clearly describes how to achieve a clean polished look that enhances your natural features. Although written over 20 years ago, Bandy's book is not the least out of date-- his advice is timeless and classic. I definately reccomend."
2,Be Warned... This is the cut version!,"Further to one of the other reviews on this page, this is indeed a truncated version of the original film, which is a shame, as the plot is actually more involving than most. If you weren't aware of the original ending, the film seems complete, but the actual finale would give the film an extra ironic punch that this version lacks."
3,O.K. shoes,"I love saucony running shoes, however, these shoes are considerably different and do not measure up as well as the saucony running shoes. Never the less, for just a basic shoe for messing around (home, park, light work, etc.) they are of good quality. I would not recommend them as a running shoe (I do not recommended them for trail running or road running or any other significant running)."
3,"Improperly listed, does NOT fit a TOYOTA T100, fits Tacoma or smaller pick up","Item does not fit a Toyota T100 Pick up. They do not have a manual mirror for the T100, it fits the smaller truck. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with the listing stating it DID fit the T100 and still says it does in the listing. Item was delivered quickly which shows the company does a good job with shipping. They accepted the item back without any problem and paid for the return shipping. Very good customer service from that standpoint. I just wish they had the Passenger Mirror for the T100 as they stated. I would still purchase the mirror from them if they were able to get the proper mirror for the T100 pick up. I called and talked to them and they stated they do not carry the mirror for the T100. Please, correct the listing so no one else has to go through having to return the item like I did."
2,DOES NOT FIT T100,This mirror is ONLY for Toyota PICKUPS 89-95 NOT for Toyota T100'S...it is far too small and doesn't come close to mounting up.
1,inferior replacement,I purchased this for my dads truck. Kind of of a cheap feel to it straight out of the box. When it came to installing it the bolt pattern did not line up. Had to modify the holes a little. Some aftermarket parts aren't bad but these seemed to remind me of the old saying 'you get what you pay for'
3,It's ok,"I ordered the original Natural Ice, but got the Medicated Cherry one instead. I would have returned it, but it really wasn't worth it. The cherry one is ok, but I did want to try what I had originally ordered."
5,I love these bags.,"I started out in the trade 2 years ago and purchased a set of bags similar to the occidentals, though mine were custom made by a man out of truckee, california. they came to a total of nearly $185. about 4 months later i bought these and i have never looked back. i not only bought one pair but i have also bought 4 more sets of these same bags, in case clc ever changes them. the only thing i did to mine was to modify them by adding a padded belt and cut off the small, high up, left hand pocket. this allows for easier access to nails in the large pocket.buy this product; you will not be sorry."
4,Comfortable and functional,"I am a land surveyor and have been using the belt for a little over a month, after getting a job with a new company. While I probably don't need all the pockets, the setup is great for carrying lots of nails, hubs, flagging...whatever I need.The suspenders are solid and take the weight off the hips. When walking back to the truck, I sometimes even put my sledge hammer in (10lbs) and cant even feel it.The only negative is the hammer positioned at the small of the back (which I moved to the right front) and my leatherman and scabbard, which I keep close to the buckle, occasionally slide off because the buckle is on the small side."
4,"Awesome, better looking in real life.","My brother-in-law seemed to really like it, and it fit really great. Now he can help put the roof on our house!"
4,Solid Product,This is a solid product. The quality seems to be good and I have found the various pockets to be useful.
4,Needs more padding,the shoulder pads slip and the padding is too thin but the rig works great. Wish it had a drill holster.
5,very good product,"I got tired of climbing up and down the ladder to get things. This is the trick. I have everything I need at my fingertips. Well made and very comfortable to wear, even for the whole day."
3,THIS IS THE MOST HONEST REVIEW,"- NO CENTER STRAPS TO KEEP THE 2 SHOULDER STRAPS TO SLIDE OFF (VERY ANNOYING)- SHOULDER PADS CONSTANTLY SLIDE- SIDE POUCH HAVE TO BE CONSTANTLY BROUGHT FORWARD OR ELSE THEY SLIDE TO THE BACK- THE BELT SLIDES OUT OF THE RIGHT POUCH WHEN YOU PUT IT ON (VERY IRRITATING SINCE YOU CONSTANTLY HAVE TO PUT IT BACK IN- THE MEASURING TAPE IS PLACED ON THE LEFT WHICH IS VERY STUPID BECAUSE MOST TAPES FACE THE LEFT SIDE SO ITS COUNTERINTUITIVE ... IT SHOULD OF BEEN PLACED ON THE RIGHT POUCH- ITS ACKWARD TO PUT ON- SHIPPING WAS PRICEY- THAT BEING SAID (THE MATERIAL IS QUALITY, AND THE POUCHES ARE SPACIOUS, AND THE STRAPS DO TAKE A LOAD OFF YOUR BACK, THE MINI OUTLETS IN THE POUCHES ARE GREAT, QUALITY METAL HOOKS, AND IT LOOKS GOOD)"
4,"very comfortable, ample space","I am what is deemed as a ""weekend warrior"" and I love this belt. It is very comfortable to wear and easy to access all of the pockets. It take some getting use to with finding pockets but I quickly overcame that.My cordless drills easily fit in the big pockets or the clips hang on the outside of the pocket with no a lot of strain.My only negative is the straps. Because the way they come across your shoulders they tend to not stay on, especially when you are moving around and contorting in odd positions. I think I may have the wife make me some kind of chest strap to attach to it."
4,Great product! Suspenders were overkill.,"I got this for my husband to build our house. He loved it, but never used the suspenders once. They were uneccesary for him. The product is great, though, and worked great for him."
5,Great Tool belt,I previously used only tool belts but i had the problem of the belt pulling down my pants when carrying heavy loads. The modular fully adjustable design of this comfort-lift system make it easy to get a perfect fit. love the extra large pockets also.
1,I not recommend this seller,I do not recommend this seller. I just shiping the shirt and to double size MM because I asked the whole SIZE M.
3,Too tall for convience,This cusion was too tall for my mother to sit on and make it go down. I wanted it for the dining room table. Just wouldn't fit.
2,Uplift didn't lift,"I bought this for my 94 year old father in law. He's roughly 150lbs. The mechanism didn't have the strength to ""lift"" him even with the control turned up all the way. Maybe this is just a bad one. If not, the rating of ""up to 220lb"" isn't quite accurate."
2,Uplift Technologies for Upeasy Lifing Cushion unsatisfactory.,"This product gently ""let down"" but the uplift was completely unsatisfactory. I needed the uplift so this product wasn't satisfactory for my need."
4,A good product,"This item was purchased for an elderly woman, but I needed to return it. The concept is great, it just didn't meet the needs of the person who it was purchased for. She needed more help than the Uplift could give her. Otherwise, I thought the product would be very helpful for someone who was just starting to need help."
4,Booster seat,"When adjusted properly for your weight, the seat does give a nice boost to help you stand up from your chair. When you sit down on it, you may have to concentrate your weight over the seat by lifting your feet off the floor, in order to get it to collapse. It is rather heavy to be carting around to use in public places. I cover mine with a towel to keep it clean. Very helpful for those of us who have problems standing from a seated position."
2,did not work as promised,i sent for a call tag on this and returned it. it did not work as promised. I am waiting to get a refund on this. Not sure why I am getting this email. hopefully I will get an email that says that I am refunded the money for this. thanks
4,BOUGHT IT FOR MY MOTHER,"BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOTHER AFTER HER KNEE SURGERY. IT HAS HELPED HER AT THE HAIR DRESSER, AT THE DINNER TABLE, AND GETTING UP OFF OF A COUCH. SHE WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
4,not easy to assemble,"I purchased this for my 91 year old grandmother and had it shipped directly to her. Though she is completely independent and has her wits about her, she was unable to assemble the seat her self. She eventually got help from a neighbor. Once she used it she commented that it was sturdier than the previous model she had. She uses it on her couch because leg weakness makes it very difficult to get up. She is completely satisfied with the functionality and form of the product. This is the third such seat she has purchased. They seem to last about 2 years before the mechanicals break."
1,not effective for mom,This product did not work out for my mom who is extremely weak and can not support herself. The cushion lift didn't lift my mom out of the chair comfortably and effectively. My mom also said it wasn't a cushion she could sit on for long periods of time. She sits for 10 hours a day.
4,Lift Assist Cushion,"I purchased this Lift Assist Cushion for my mother and so far she is very pleased with it. Took about two days for her to get accustomed to it, but again she is 85 years old with Parkinsons.I think this has been a great help too her and I am probably going to purchase second one for another chair that she uses. At this price you cant go wrong."
2,"Instrumentally sounds, Steve's Vocals detract","I am the biggest Kansas you'll ever find, , hence I'm entering this review, something I'd never bother doing for most music.. However, that said, this is the first Kansas album that I cannot listen to. Unquestionably, the musicianship is as good or better than ever. But I cannot help comparing Steve's voice of the 70's with this album, and for me(of course, this is purely personal preference), it has lost resonance and therefore the ability to be as emotionally engaging. Steve's voice is not such an issue on new albums such as 'freaks of nature'. But on this album of classic Kansas, it does not compare to the originals, and I find myself having to turn it off. If you want to listen to the tacks on this album, buy the original recordings."
2,Where did Steve's beautiful voice go?,"Don't get too excited about this CD. Steve's voice unfortunately has declined to the point that I cringe when I hear this CD. Buy 2 for the Show ahead of this one and the KBFH recording. I find it difficult not to recommend a Kansas CD, but this should have been left in the vault."
1,Don't Buy This!,"Don't get me wrong. I love this band and have everything they've ever released, including Walsh's and Livgren's solo material. Like someone said earlier, the band sounds great but Walsh is so awful during this I'm surprised it was ever released. I listened to this once and won't listen to it again (remember, I love this band). So save yourself the money and instead buy Sail On or Device, Voice, Drum if you want to see live Kansas. Also, Walsh's new solo CD, Shadowman is very good. Buy it now!"
3,Not their best live album but not horrible,"This is the lineup I saw a couple of times in small theatres and hole-in-the-wall clubs in the '90s:Steve Walsh - vocals and keyboardsGreg Robert - keyboardsBilly Greer - bass and vocalsRichard Williams - guitarsDavid Ragsdale - violin and guitarPhil Ehart - drumsThis is a very rough recording, and, as has been noted, Walsh's vocals are not his best, but it's still commendable. However, it is definitely not on the same level as ""Two For The Show"" or ""Device Voice Drum"".Kerry Livgren makes a ""guest"" appearance on ""Dust In The Wind"". I wonder if this was done just to give the album a bit of a push sales-wise...""Hey, Kerry Livgren's on it!""There is also an old recording of the hard blues ""Lonely Street"" done with the original lineup, which is actually better than most of the rest of the album.It's not horrible. Listening to it brings back good memories of when I saw them live. But get one of their other live albums instead."
3,"Great sound, great songs...great singer ?.","This live-album has a lot of energy, infact more than their first live-album ""Two For The Show"". But that first one is still the best. There's great playing on this one, but singer Steve Walsh is a bit of an enigma. -Here we have some of the finest rock music ever written, but a singer who destroys the picture. It's really a rather sad affair, having been one of the greatest voices, and now this. -Talk about falling from grace. I realize almost 30 years of singing is bound to do some damage, but why all these theatrics ?.(I've nicknamed him ""Donald Duck"".) ""Kansas""-songs are majestic enough as they are. Should they ever need a new vocalist again, check out ""Tyketto""'s Danny Vaughn(ex-""Waysted""). -He's the ultimate ""Kansas""-frontman that never was. Believe me, for an avid fan it hurts me to say all this, but it's the gospel truth."
2,No vocals just music would be better than this.,"The band sounds great live with only one hitch. The vocals are terrible, not only can't Walsh hit the notes, but he can't even keep time. Sounds like he needs breathing lessons! it's sad. If he was on, this would be great. I wouldn't purchase it though, vocals ruin it for the true Kansas fan. Again the rest of the group kicks a**."
5,Great band with a unique sound.,I first heard of the Myriad at the Cornerstone Festival. I saw them in concert and the whole crowd was amazed by them. There sound on the stage prompted me to buy the album when I got home.I fell in love with it right away. They have a very unique way of writing songs. The production on the album is very good. This is a Christian band and it shows in their music. But it is not overwhelming I'm sure non-Christians will like it too.
3,OH MAN!! It stopped spinning again!!,"The first day I received the sprinkler in the mail we hooked it up, it spun around great for the 1st 15 minutes, and then it stopped. The fish need a little push and then it will spin for a few minutes until you give another push. We will still use it this summer, but I think I will look into something different next year."
4,Outdoor Fun,"My 3-year-old really liked this toy. Although the folks at Amazon recommended it for 18 years and up, even my 16-year-old was a little bored after a few minutes."
3,sprinkler review,"This product is good for the small children but when you want it to spin, it spins for a while and stops."
2,Only LITTLE kids!!,"This is not great, but a one year old enjoyed it as it was just his speed. Do not buy for toddlers who are looking to get cooled off and have some fun!"
4,Lot's Of Fun,"Purchased this for my daycare children to play in and they had 2 hours of pure fun.They enjoy having it spin the most,The kids love it and so do I knowing they enjoy it so much ."
3,Lightweight but with charm,"I didn't realize how old this Metzger book was when I purchased it. It's a lightweight romance but with a certain amount of charm. The characters are likeable, including the animals. It makes for a pleasurable two hour read."
5,Must love dogs (not the movie),"Okay, so I am a sucker for stories involving dogs. This book has such a great dog character that it has become one of my all time favorite regencies. And Metzger writeswith verve and humor which bring all the characters to life, canine and human. I have read many of her books but had never encountered this one previously sodiscovering it was such fun. If you like Metzger's style, her characters and her plots, you will enjoy this book. Read it aloud to your pets?"
5,"You'll laugh and laugh and if you love dogs, you'll keep it.","This Regency is formated as a ""typical"" regency except our narrator is the herorine's dog. You'll laugh and laugh as you will with most of Metzger's books. . . but, if you are a dog lover, you'll want to share it with all your dog loving friends. However, keep track of who you loan it to. They'll want to share it with their friends and family who love dogs. This book is a hoot and a tour d'force for Metzger. I just wish she wrote more more often."
5,LOL,"I would give it six stars if I could.It is a story about Fitz, so called because he is a bastard (is half shepherd and half hunting hound) and his humans. Those he loves and those he dislikes. He is something of a scamp showing people exactly what he thinks of them. He also knows his Roman and Greek mythology and talks to the animals around him, rats, horses, doves etc. It is so very funny. You cannot but love him.It is truly a brilliant story which you can read again and again and still laugh."
5,Easy up/easy down.,"Great little privacy tent, really simple to setup and take down, as advertisted it only takes a few seconds. Comes with nice storage bag too!"
4,Good to go,"So excited to have it. Really haven't used it. But like that it's part of our emergency kit for ""just in case"" type of scenarios. Well it's also part of our camping stuff too and we'll be using it later this month. It's spacious, easy to open and set up. Goes well with the cleanwaste system of products."
3,Much darker than picture displays.,"I received this lamp and was surprised how dark the shades were. When the light is off the shades are more of a golden brown. If your looking for something that has a soft muted golden color when off--look elsewhere. When the light is on the color is better, but still not the beautiful yellow-gold color displayed in the photo. Other than the color the lamp is what I expected."
5,Great work/get things done gloves,"Ive always been a fan of framer gloves, just having two fingers and a thumb free doesn't compromise protection and gives me some added dexterity that i wouldn't have if i had full fingered gloves.CLC seems to make the best high quality and very durable. I've taken a pair through hell and back and they still hold together very well, and since those fingers are open i don't have to take them off to get to the little stuff."
4,Comfortable and well designed,"I picked these up for use around the house on various projects. The open fingertip design makes working with nails and screws a lot easier, but still keeps your fingers mostly protected from splinters, etc. These are not going to be good for working in dirt or wet environments, but that's why they're called ""framer"" gloves: they're best when working with lumber, plywood, and the like. The overall quality of construction and materials appears to be good. But its important to remember that the trade off with being comfortable and flexible is that they will probably wear out a little faster than more heavy-duty models. I'd give these 1 year in daily heavy use, maybe a few years if you're a weekender. But at $17 a pop, you're talking a low investment for something that is so comfortable and useful. I just wish they came some different colors."
3,more of a hospital dramedy than a mystery thriller,"Wasn't sure exactly what this book wanted to be, a drama, a comedy, a thriller, or what. It had entirely too many main characters and left too many interesting bits unsaid/unresolved at the end. After thinking about it, I'd say that this book was sort of like reading an episode (or maybe a season of) ""ER"" but at least on the tv show they can resolve some of the patient's stories. Still, I enjoyed this book much more than I did ""Le Divorce,"" which seemed to have some outrageously nutty plot twists."
2,Disappointing,"I love Le Divorce, so I was sorry to struggle through this one. It felt clumsy, obvious and a little like a soap opera. Oh well."
2,"Lots of Potential, But...","Like the other reviewer, I couldn't quite figure out what this novel wanted to be. There were many issues that were left unresolved, and there were potential sub-plots that were touched upon but not developed -malpractice, Ivy's ex, etc. Just when I thought the action was really moving along, it just fizzled. In the end, I was left with more questions that answers. Aargh."
4,The Mission Raw,"Though this latest concert capture sounds more like a bootleg album and less like a professional live recording, it still holds some of the great mysterious, forbidden and energetic live elements that have made the Mission famous over the years. Once you get past that answering machine-like sound quality, the songs really grab you and the spirit and vibe of the live Mission show shines through. The song performances are great. There are some interesting and insightful passages by Wayne Hussey in the CD booklet. And, the cover artwork is classic Mission. This is a must have for real Missionaries."
4,"Good, but not great","Typical ECM fare this - a sparse, slow tempo recording where the instruments have plenty of space to breathe. Although on paper this is a Manu Katche CD, in practice it's the rest of the band that take centerstage with Katche happy to play a mainly supporting role. If I had to summarize this album, I'd describe it as ""friendly, listenable jazz that could easily serve as background music or would reward concentrated listening''.It's good but because it doesn't break new ground, it ain't great."
5,Colourful but subtle,"This is a lovely CD. Not complex jazz, some might find it a little soft, but beautiful in its simplicity. A little reminiscent of Garbarek's own material, or Eberhard Weber's. Katche is excellent, colourful but subtle with no grandstanding, and the others, Garbarek, Marcilewski, Stanko etc are all having a good time. Garbarek doesn't go out of his way but is in his usual good lyrical form, Marcilewski, not unlike Rainer Brunninghaus, keeps the harmonies coming sweetly and goes nicely with the flow, while Stanko throws in a few surprises to liven things up. The sound quality is top-notch. To get the most of the music's intricacies play on a good sound system and don't have distractions."
4,Pleasant music but...,This group can't really decide what they want. The influence of Jan Garbarek changes the tonal quality of the songs. When he is playing they are less subdued which isn't necessarily a good thing.The pianist is outstanding as is the percussionist thus the 4 stars.
1,Smooth Jazz Aaaaa... NO!!!!!,"EMC, a label known for polished recording and production fails on this bum production. Listen to any sample and try to remember that this is an EMC release, and I'm not a huge fane of the label, but this music is what they should play for recovering cancer patients in the hospital. Plane and simple, this music sucks, and that's coming from a mid-twenties musician with 3,000 jazz recordings -K."
4,Richly Lyrical,"Manu Katché is a drummer who has appeared on several ECM releases; as far as I know, this his his first effort as a leader. He has assembled quite a band, including veteran sax man Jan Garbarek, notable trumpeter Tomasz Stanko, and two members of Stanko's band, Marcin Wasilewki (piano) and Slawomir Kurkiewicz (bass). All the music was composed by Katché, which might lead you to expect driving music, heavy on rhythm and popping with power, but that is not the case. Instead, the music is richly lyrical, with nice contributions by Stanko and Garbarek and solid support from Wasilewki and Kurkiewicz.Those who tend to shy away from contemporary jazz might find this recording a pleasant surprise, richly rewarding with its melody and expression, yet with enough energy and passion to please real jazz fans. This is not ""lite jazz."" It is enjoyable jazz, well-played and well-recorded, which should appeal to a wide cross-section of listeners."
4,Wow! Not since Pat Metheny have I been this impressed.,"This group is amazing! I've been missing out on some fabulous music. Sophisticated, complex yet fun to listen to. I'd love to see them live."
1,don't even bother,"I bought this CD because I couldn't find that particular remix of Shima Uta anyplace else over a year ago -- i was excited to find the CD, actually, and it was pretty cheap where I got it. Upon getting it home and actually listening to some of the other tracks on it, though, i began getting nauseous at the thought of listening to the rest of it. Bleh.The only good thing about the CD is that the songs aren't in a continuous mix, so I was able to rip the one i wanted and toss the CD off into a dark, cobweb infested corner and forget it ever existed... until i wrote this review. I figured it was my civic duty to warn people off or something. I mean, I've heard bad techno before, but this CD is unbelievably bad."
3,Lashun was the best thing in this album,"this was a pretty good album but Lashun is what made the album as wonderful as it was i played the song she sung almost a hundred times. i am ready to buy another cd because that cd is sounding scratch. Overall it was a good album some of the favorite cuts areKnowing Your With Me, the Gospel Medley, He Can do Everything andKings and Kingdoms"
4,Fun for the girls!,"I ordered the hay ball in hopes that it would solve our hay mess problem. I was keeping my guinea pigs' hay in a rectangular bin, but they were getting in the bin and using it for more than just eating their hay. Plus, it took up a lot of floor space.The hay ball has been a success, they get excited and ""popcorn"" around the cage when I refill it. One of my girls loves it so much that she enjoys pulling all the hay out of the ball... which is the downside. She'll take a nibble from every strand, then go back to pull out more. Fortunately her sister will eat some of the hay on the ground, but it mostly goes to waste. Since hay is so cheap, and the ball gives them something to do that makes them happy, so I don't mind.I hang the ball on the side of our C&C; cage and it stays there securely. We haven't had any issues with the ball falling apart or the door coming undone. Our girls are rough with it!Definitely a must-have for guinea pig owners!"
2,My rabbit doesn't like/use it.,"I bought one of these, but my mini-rex bunny won't touch it. He tried to use it a few times, but didn't like it. I tried packing it full and packing it lightly with hay. He prefers his hay in boxes, in a hanger on his cage, and on the floor in his cage and run-around. I hear some bunnies do like it, though. It spins fine, but load it carefully or the plastic sides will pop off the center wire part - it'll snap back together, but the hay will pour everywhere on the floor or where ever you are when you're loading it."
1,Extremely messy,Bought this so my chins wouldn't make such a mess with their hay but this seems like it causes more of a mess than the hay alone ever did. It's still in the cage but I don't even use it. Once you place the hay in the ball it falls right back out. Not very happy that I wasted my money on this product!!
3,My bunny isn't sure about this,"Looks like it has great potential, but my bun is tentative about using it. I thought she'd like it, but she hasn't seemed to take a liking to it just yet."
3,hayfeeder,"I bought this for my guinea pigs. They eat ALOT of hay so empty it fairly quickly. The baby got stuck inside it once, so funny because we were there but could have been bad if he was stuck a long time. Which brings me to the con, the opening is inconvenient. There isn't a latching mechanism, you basically pull it free and push it into place. I do like that none of the hay falls outside of the cage like the hook on feeders. It may actually be a bit entertaining for them too, who knows. Glad I purchased it but wouldn't rav about it."
4,Creative way to keep hay off the cage floor,This is a good way to keep my bunny's hay clean and off the floor of the cage. It is pretty big and does take up a decent amount of room in the cage so I moved it higher up so she can still walk under it. Its easy for her to get the hay out and she seems to enjoy spinning it as well. I only gave it 4 stars because I can't figure out how to close the hay ball. I have to secure it with a zip tie every time I add more hay.
3,It's not as easy to use as it seems,"This hay holder made putting hay in the cage awkward. It's much easier, and less expensive, to just place the hay on the floor of the cage so the guinea pigs can eat it from there."
3,worth the price,"My rabbit loves it, its a little hard to open and close though but it works just fine for the price."
2,It doesn't close properly.,"PROS:looks nice,GP approved.Cons:WONT STAY CLOSE, when stand is used either way my GP chews/play on/with the metal and it ends up toppling over ontop of my GP,takes up ALOT of space,( rolls infront of waterbottle, ontop of food bowl, blocks enterence to igloo)Grey area:It rolls and hay falls out;if rolled enough it will be empty, with hay covering the bedding.Solutions:I have to use a binder clip to keep it closed, don't use the stand, once its empty I take it out(before I sleep), let my GP eat his hay, then refill it in the morning.-edit- rating went down a star because my guinea pig broke it during the night."
2,hard to fill,"its really hard to fill ,it is hard for my bun bun to get the hay out of it, and he knocks it off his cage alot . not worth the hassle"
2,Can't close the door when filled with hay,"It works well when empty. The rabbit does like taking hay out of it. However it tends to fall apart when you fill it with hay; then it is hard to put back together; and the door does not close anymore. So ok, but not great."
5,Great product,"This resolved the issue of having hay all over the place. The other hay holders would get hay everywhere, but this one keeps the mess at a minimum. This is the third type of hay holder I have bought or made and it the best by far. I also like the fact that the rabbit is being mentally stimulated while eating."
1,Hard to use--rabbit not into it,"Maybe I don't have the patience, but I couldn't get the ball part to snap together easily nor get the hay in to put it on the wheel mechanism. Once it was together, my rabbit wasn't into it so all I thought was I wasted time and money on this."
3,"Don't use for main feeding, it doesn't hold enough and is too difficult for bunnies to get at the food","I bought it originally intending to use it for just plain hay, but it doesn't hold enough for a bunny and my two won't bother with it when they've got the bucket o' hay within easy reach. So once their ready, I'll put a mixture of alfalfa and timothy hay in there as a treat instead of their normal boring timothy hay. But it's really only good for treats, not regular feeding."
3,Guinea pigs,My two guinea pigs didn't have a problem eating from this hay holder but I wouldn't say it's the best thing out there. I recently replaced it with a hay manger but I had the ball attached to the side of the cage. There would always be a mess underneath the holder there was hardly a point in having one. The door also wouldn't stay shut and my guinea pig would just stick her head in there and eat which could be dangerous. Putting the hay on the bottom of the cage is almost the same as using this product.
3,Messy But Fun,My guinea pig loves it. It's fun to see him spin the wheel around to get the hay. It's messy though. Hay gets every where. We ended up just using a tray for his hay to put on the side of the cage. Less mess! :)
1,"DON'T listen to ""DWales's"" review.","I've tried this exact item with my guinea pigs. It's the most awful contraption possible, as far as finding easier ways to keep the hay mess under control.It doesn't work. Period.The plastic ball doesn't roll the way it should. You can barely get ONE piece of hay out at a time. The guinea pig has to reach up or elongate their neck to reach anything, and when they finally get a piece, the ball will MOVE or ROLL, when it shouldn't.The plastic stand that holds it is in NO way sufficient to feed guinea pigs (rabbits are very strong-stronger than guinea pigs, so I have no idea how ""DWales"" can possibly give this item 5 stars.All I got was pure frustration from this thing, and I returned it the next day."
3,Like drinking from a fire hydrant.,"Flipping through this book is like drinking from a fire hose-- or hydrant. There are of course many classic pictures of dogs, in normal and abnormal situations, taken all over the world. But these are buried under too many good-but-hardly-great shots. Half these pictures would make a better collection; half of that even better. Erwitt goes for quantity.For quality, try Conrad's ""Les Chiens de Paris"", 1/8th the size, but culled from a wide assortment of photographers (incl. Erwitt), though in just one (forgive the pun) spot.Also, if you're gift-shopping for someone else's children, as I was, be aware that Erwitt includes some near-naked Frenchmen and Brazilians with his dogs."
3,Too many blah photos dilute some really great ones,"Agree with another reviewer: some great, iconic photos are included in this volume, and it makes a great gift for a dog lover, but it's way too thick for its own good - many of the photos just shouldn't have found their way into a book."
4,So lighthearted and fun,"I can see why a few reviewers are a little put off by the girth of this tome; it has a massive page count and the format (small) doesn't really lend itself to that sort of weight, to say nothing of photography.However, the photos are great and very fun, and this is well worth an economical cost for those not so interested in a ginormous coffee-table book."
3,A little disappointing,"There are tons of photos in this book, but I'm a little disappointed for several reasons. The prints are small (the book is 5 x 7 inches) and they're dark (they're all black-and-white, which is fine, but they're dark -- lots of gray tones). These prints would be much, much better in a larger format because some of the photos have a lot going on. I realize the book would be more expensive that way, but this format really doesn't do them justice. I bought this to have a book of fun dog photos, but I wouldn't recommend this. I think there are better choices out there."
3,a sweet little book,"this is a sweet little (inexpensive) book of dogs. there are around 500 photos in this collection, which is why i only gave it three stars. erwitt should have culled through the photos a bit more. because of the sheer quantity of pictures in this collection, you have an over-abundance of mediocre and ""average"" shots, and a few bad ones. but there are many good phtots in this collection, but i think the book would have been strnoger if erwitt had cut it back to a hundred (or less) photos."
4,The Holy Bible in Modern English/Burgundy,"Because Fenton carefully explained why his translation differed in certain instances from other Biblical translations, and also set out for the reader the historical environment in certain divisions of his rendition, it makes the Bible become more real and plausible. Thus it reads more easily and is more readily assimilated."
5,very pleased customer,"not happy with the printing, but over-all I'm pleased to own this translation, and the shipping process was professional and expedient."
1,"Should not be classified as ""Walking Shoes""","I purchased these shoes when I started working on a job that required walking almost the entire shift. My feet are killing me, after working for almost a month. There is no cushioning in them, nor much arch support."
1,Horrible junk - stay away from SpeakCraft,"Too bad I can't give it negative stars. What a piece of junk! The designer of this unit should not have a job in electronics, or any job that takes brains. Go clerk at 7/11 please!It is so bad, not just in how lousy it works, but in it's design from the get-go. I will never buy any product from a company that designed this thing.Prying the levers that you need to in order to connect the speaker wires is nearly impossible - you could break your fingers doing it and if you use pliers, which you will have to, the unit breaks.I just replaced mine with a unit (Sima) that works far better, is far easier to set up, and costs 1/10 the price. I threw my SpeakCraft in the trash.Good ridance!"
3,"Live TV Production,No Audience","Although I was grateful to have this chance to see Juan Oncina and Leyla Gencer, there is a technical issue that makes this video difficult to watch: the DVD I received is not in black&white, it is in light pink and dark pink, almost red; altogether an unpleasant anomaly. No matter how hard I tried, it was impossible to ignore. In addition, this is a live television production & my guess is the director was much too busy with technical issues to make any attempt to put these fine singers at ease in this awkward environment. I would recommend buying a CD, instead, if one is available."
4,title for review...or something,"Neat book, and found at a great price! Thanks! The cover was different than the one pictured, but is that really something to complain about, given the contents were the same?A must-have for fans of ol' horn-head, easily one of the best runs on the series EVER."
4,"Partial review of ""Jump Start""","This was recommended to me as an introductory book. But, like most of the others I've bought, it soon broke the rules. A concepts is clearly explained, then an example buries you in advanced material that is not even introduced, let alone explained. However, one can see this is an original book with many interesting perspectives and examples, and I mean to return to it once I've really mastered the basics of OOP and Java. Yet this was not a ""Jump Start"" except in the sense of jumping over a cliff into the sea. You'd better know how to swim!"
5,Better than hoped for,This box is well made and was better looking than I dared hope for. It was adequate in size for the Oneida cutlery I purchased and really made the silverware look and feel much more special. The wood colour and finish are elegant and it arrived in perfect condition. A good buy
4,Very Basic But Better Than VHS,"There is no menu or chapter selection option on this DVD...only the movie. But this is the only DVD printing of this movie, so beggars can't be choosers. Video quality isn't perfect but better than VHS. Audio quality is also not great but better than VHS."
4,Crazy cheese!,"So how much more cheesy can a flick get? Watch this one and you will truly see what it is that Cheese fans love about this movie. A fave of ours from our childhood, this one was a must have for our library. If you like your special effects just shy of seeing the fishing wire, the actors cut from the same mold as a hundred other B range hammers, then this movie is for you. Theres plague, nature as purposefully evil and filthy dirty greedy land grabbers. Grab a bowl of popcorn, the hunny of your choice and a cold glass of sugary goodness, this is a great ride and a keeper for any dvd collection."
4,Bats!,I enjoyed this movie. It isn't for everybody. I don't think it would be a candidate for a remake. All the new technology wouldn't improve it. It's suspenseful and creepy just the way it is.
3,70's tv original bat movie...,"...kinda interesting indian & science related bat story, actors, acting but this show is a 'lil slow, needing more good bat action scenes in addition to midfilm-campers attacked, near end-in cage bat testing & end-bat cave slaughter."
4,Just FYI,Just a little information for those planning to order this item through Amazon. Although the title states (at this time) that you are ordering Fly Fusion NotebookS (plural); note you are NOT. You will get A notebook. The product itself is amazing. Hopefully Amazon has a few minutes to update the description and title so as not to mislead future buyers.
1,Don't waste your time,Product overall is not that entertaining or educational and doesn't work all the time. Don't waste money.
2,Youtube has better transfers,"The title says it: youtube has better transfers. I was really excited about buying this CD, until I searched on youtube for Fritzi Jokl and listened randomly to some other transfers. The difference was instantly noticeable.I think there's also a Preiser CD out there, but I haven't listened to it.LYS is not to be trusted when it comes to voice recordings. I remember I was really excited about buying the Eide Norena set published by them. This lasted until Ward Marston transferred one of her recordings for his label. That moment I realized I had never actually listened to Eide Norena. The same thing is more or less valid also for this Fritzi Yokl CD.Save your money and listen to these recordings on youtube."
4,New Twist on an Old Favorite,"Burton Visotzky, in his down-to-earth voice, brings a new way of reading the heavenly work. He looks critically at Genesis 25-50 and in doing so opens it up to less experienced readers as well as people very familiar with the Bible. While some of his interpretations are ""out-there"" and others even mildly offensive to traditional readings, all are interesting and inspire as well as encourage original thinking. The Hebrew Bible may be the most read work in Western Civilization but Visotzky's book opens the reader's minds to new ways of thinking and new possibilities as to what is really there and how to relate that to contemporary life."
4,not as memorable as his other works,"While this is a good book, it lacks the original memorable concept that is really stressed in his other writings.He wants us to understand that change is a necissary part of life and success requires it. Many of the concepts of the new economy are exposed, such as fast feedback loops and using the internet in new creative ways.Here is the catch: We invest so much of our lives into who we are at that point in time that it is nearly impossible to change. If you are unhappy at your work, and it is not sending you where you need to be, then why are you there?"
1,"""Survival is not enough"" - enough what ?","Seth is a tsunami of self-promotion. Which is a good thing for him, because he writes rubbish, and he will need all his skills if people ever start seeing how much of their time he is wasting.This infantile book, using a silly word he has re-defined (zooming) in an attempt to make him as famous as Charles Darwin, merely serves to provoke an interesting question. Is he, at some level, having a good laugh at everyone who buys his books? Or is he a self-absorbed dope?""My goal in writing this book is to explain the paradigm and sell you ..."". (P.3) I exited right there."
5,Great Clamp Tool,This tool was a great buy and it was cheap!!! I work on alot of fords and there are many clamps that these pliers work perfectly on. Its locks help in tight spots where its hard to squeez clamps and twist the clamps to a good resting spot. Alot of leverage in the length of pliers (the pic is deceiving...) and their weight is good too. Good mechanic tool!!!
2,"Build quality is great, they just don't grab hole clamps as well as other brands.","I purchased these to replace a set purchased from harbor freight. The build quality is great, but the ends on them just don't hold hose clamps securely. I ended up buying a set of bluepoint pliers from the snap-on guy and they blow these things away. Perhaps they hold some hose clamps well but not the ones I work with..."
5,Quality tool,High quality tools at a great price. These have been very useful for getting at clamps in hard to reach places.
5,OK/,ok I was satisfied with my purchase and i am not in the mood to put 19 words just to give you a feedback.
3,A little slow in the middle but pickes up again later.,"The book is in general good but the middle is a little slow.I stopped reading for over a month because i got bored with it. When I started reading it agin i had a hard time getting back into it, but when I did it was good.Ronda Hancoc"
4,Ah Vampires and Witches heping each other,"I read this years ago and have the sudden urge to read it again. I am one who enjoyed it. Although it portrays the blood lust as an addiction,it shows that not everyone can 'believe' in one thing and needs to find their own way to 'deal' with their addiction rather than a '12 step-ford (wives)' approach. I am an Ann Rice addict and was surprised to find Nasaw's book to quench my thirst as well."
3,addicted to blood,"This book is obviously well thought out and full of fresh new ideas about humanity and addiction. As a 17 year old, I have very little in common with the themes of marriage and wanting children. It was, however, my only turn off from the book. Despite that, I have read it countless times. I reccomend it to anyone who likes a slightly warped romantic story, or anyone who has ever been addicted to anything or felt like an outsider. However, most readers my age or who are more into wierd sex, would do better to read LOST SOULS by Poppy Z. Brite, which is very similar, but with younger characters."
5,"DELICIOUSLY ERRIE,DEEPLY MOVING,ABSOLUTLY HEARTSTOPING.","BLOOD-ADDICTS,LIKE ANY OTHER ADDICT IN AN ANONYMOUS GROUP,THAT STRIVE TO KEEP CLEAN.(well,most of them atleast) IT WAS THE MOST REALISTIC ,NON-FICTION BOOK IVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE....IT ACTUALLY TOOK ME OUT OF THE ROOM,AND INTO THIR WORLD OF WONDERFUL BLOOD-HIGHS!"
2,Excellent Concept... Too Long,"I enjoyed the concept of this book but for what it was and what it really wanted to tell us, it was far too long. If you are going to make a novel of epic proportions, then you need to create some kind of world like Anne Rice does."
3,Not what I was expecting,"I purchased this book because it was said to be rather good Splatterpunk novel. Although it really did lack the heavy gore or sex that classifies a book as such, the story was not a total disappointment. The story is a new twist to vampires, really giving them a more scientific reasoning for being. I did find it a bit predictable at times. All in all, I did enjoy reading it and will look for other novels writen by Jonathan Nasaw."
5,Time To Play,"This book is fun to read, thoughtful, and inspirational. Frank Forencich has figured out how fitness got boring and why ""working out"" really seems like work: we've forgotten the importance of play. This book is satisfying on a number of levels -- intellectual (it discusses the importance of function in an evolutionary context), emotional (it reminds us how fun it USED to be to exercise), and practical (it gives us good, simple roadmaps to recapturing the love of movement we had as kids). Forencich gives the reader a great paradigm: focus on function, and the other benefits of fitness will come naturally. The title isn't just tongue-in-cheek -- by the end of the book you realize that not just the quality of your life but your life itself might really depend on your playing as if your life depends on it. This book goes way beyond your typical exercise book. It's the only one of its kind I know of. As a fitness book, though, it's definitely the best I've read. Ever."
5,A fluid and playful approach to physical fitness...,"A fluid and playful approach to physical fitness. Frank Forencich tackles many of the phantoms associated with sport culture and he opens up the ideas of excesize, sport and fitness in a way that is acheivable to all. In his own words, excersize should be ""playfull, primal and functional"". Frank clearly explains how excersize is a basic ingrediant in life and how it can remain child-like and challenging in all levels of development.In addition, this book is an easy read. Frank carries the reader with his light and humorous wit through a history of physical fitness rooted in the discapline of evolutionary biology."
4,A Refreshing Change,Hats off to Frank Forencich for offering a new outlook on our state of decreased health! This book offers a very interesting and educational view of exercise and physical activity from an evolutionary standpoint. Mr. Forencich is definately an original thinker and quite possibly ahead of his time with such a unique outlook on exercise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in aquiring original knowledge about health & fitness.
5,GOOD FOR THESE OLD EYES,I REALLY NEEDED THIS - CAUSE THESE EYES ARE GOING....GREAT PRODUCT..HAVE PURCHASED TWO TIME BEFORE - AND BOTH TIMES LEFT THEM IN HOTEL BATHROOMS...OOOPS......THIS TIME I WILL BE MORE CAREFUL -
4,Very good but not perfect,The unit is very nice looking but perhaps the size is a little overkill. I like being able to place it against the wall and out of the way. Does a decent job of heating a poorly insulated room that is about 300 sq. feet with no other heat source. I was able to maintain the room at 60 degrees when the outside temperature dipped to freezing recently. My main gripe is that the heat comes out near the top of the unit (about 2' above the floor). You can't direct the airflow any lower than horizontal so it stays pretty cold on the floor. Just being about to blow the warm air downward would make me change this rating to a 5 star.
3,check the cable if on high,"It does the job, but when I use it on high setting longer than 30 mins or so, the cable starts to get warm on several spots. The cable looks cheap and nondurable, I wonder if it would melt or cause fire hazard if I leave it on longer. Lasko's several previous models were recalled for a similar reason, that's why I am worried. I am thinking about returning the unit."
1,Failed within 6 weeks,"After 6 weeks of light use the heater will no longer power on. 30-min on hold with Lasko's disinterested customer support, make sure you have your Amazon receipt handy when you call, or you will have to call back in. The unit did put out some decent heat before it died."
4,Good for the price,"We bought this heater last fall, and it kept us warm all winter while sitting on the couch. It's not going to warm a room, but if you want something to keep you warm while you're sitting at the computer, reading, watching tv, etc., this will definitely do the job.Our only complaint was the incredibly short cord."
4,Great heater for limited space,"We've had this heater for about a month, and I have to say, it's done just about everything we wanted. We haven't had really cold weather here in Indiana yet, so I don't know how it will do when temps are below 20 degrees. So far I've found that it supplements house central heat (turned down to low to mid 60s) well, in a relatively small room. And, as others have said, sealing the room somewhat helps. One thing I've found that doesn't work very well on the Lasko 758000 is the thermostat. When you set the heater to ""Auto,"" it kicks in the thermostat setting. You get the current room temperature and you set the temperature you would like the room to be. Presumably, the heater will shut off when it reaches that temperature. Well, my experience has been that it isn't very accurate. I have simply used the heater on manual and turn it on and off as I need it. What do you want for this price? Even with this factor, I recommend the Lasko 758000."
2,Doesn't last,"I bought this unit last year, it worked very well for one season. However, it just stopped working one day. It was cheap, but considering that it doesn't last long, I wouldn;t buy this again."
2,Poor quality,After two seasons use the blower section of this unit began to wobble and make noise. I expected it to last a bit longer.
4,Lasko 758000 heats bonus room as good as gas heater,"Unfortunately this is made in China instead of the usa. It did heat my bonus room to a temperature that is very livable... I decided not to use my natural gas ventless heater because is smells and gives of carbon monoxide (regardless what the manufactures of gas ventless heater say!!). My bonus room is over the garage and approximately 16x20...Satisfied but could use a thermostat so on low it doesn't keep heatling up the roomAlso, I hate supporting a communist country!!"
2,Don't buy it,"This product is great when it works. However, the first one I bought didn't. They replaced it, but then ordered another at the end of last winter. Only used it two or three times and it won't even turn on now.Not a good buy."
3,smelly,"This is a nice product and like the thermostat control, for the price good. Our problem with the unit is that after a few times of using it, it then sat for a short period before use again. When we started the unit back up we noticed a very offensive smell that won't go away. I would be curious if anyone else has that problem. I didn't notice one other review with that comment."
3,Not so hot,"Unit works well. Controls are simple, easy to set, but a remote control would be a seriously good addition. I'm using it in a large, draughty room, and it's inadequate, in spite of being labelled a ""Large Room"" heater. I also think the heat would be more efficient if it came out nearer to the floor, instead of on top. And the adjustable air flow louvre will not direct the air flow low enough to blow on the cold, cold floor. I just can't imagine what makes this heater so bloody large. I have other, smaller, less expensive heaters that put out just as much heat. It doesn't take up much floor space. It's just so tall! Overall, there's nothing wrong with it. It's just too expensive, and not warm enough for the size."
3,Cyclonic heater,Bought this cyclonic heater for my basement which is drafty and cold. It does no better at heating it as any other of the less expensive heaters does. It looks good and has a thermostat on it though.
3,Heat or Lights which will you choose?,"Okay, first of all, the style and function is great, but bc the wattage is so high, it keeps tripping my circuit breaker and everything goes out. I am thinking it may not be worth the hassle of going outside(yes our breaker is outside) every time it goes out."
2,Did not work but.....,"I sent it back and was promptly reimbursed. Although I did not replace this heater I own anotherLasko heater, where the heat comes from the bottom, that warms a good size room quite well.So I think it was probably just a dud."
3,Fan's HIGH speed is actually SLOW.,"Some of the same heater objections as noted above, with a fan speed problem not mentioned. I found that when unit operates on HIGH, the speed is actually SLOW.Furthermore, there are no other adjustments in order to increase the fans speed to fix this problem."
1,Failed out of the box,Failed out of the box. Could not hold a temp and would go into sleep mode after about a minute of use.
2,Doesn't hold up,"I purchased this unit for a pittance at Walmart. It operated as advertised for about four months, then quit. Now I get a red power light but nothing else."
3,poor design,"I believe that this heater should've been designed to have heat vents on towards the bottom rather than merely at the top.As a result, since heat rises, all areas below 3 feet remain cold.I mistakenly assumed the vents in the picture at the bottom would give off heat as I had intended to place this in front of a bedroom window to create the wall of heat effect for insulation.Instead, this works as an overpriced, bulky heat fan.On the plus side, the ceramic construction makes it less of a fire hazard and the temperature controls seem to function accurately."
3,Simple heater,"I read all the reviews on here and decided on this heater. We have a pellet stove to heat a large family room with 14ft ceilings. The pellet stove has been bothering my son's allergies, so we opted for electric instead. From what we read, this would be a good option. It works well enough to keep a section of the room warm. Unfortunately, it is very tipsy on carpet. I also don't like, as many others mentioned, that you cannot aim the vent any lower than 180 degrees. Also, it gets very hot on the vent area...not great around young kids.Overall, it is a simple heater that is quiet and puts out a bit of heat. That's that. Otherwise, trust the reviews on here and decide if the negatives are things you can live with. I wish I would've opted for a different heater."
3,okay but pricey,"The buttons and overall build in this unit are cheaply made though the lever to adjust the direction of the hot air flow is well made. I like the fact that the unit is tall so you can point it at you if you are sitting. Overall, I think it is pricey but will keep it as it gets the job done."
3,heats good for small room,This item heats good for smaller room. My bathroom is a very large bathroom and it took a lone long time to get room to pleasant temperature. I recommend making sure of your room size before buying this item. Amazon was very prompt on crediting my account upon return. Returning items at Amazon is very easy.
1,Very Poor,"Maybe I have a defective Lasko Cyclonic Ceramic Heater. The blower barely blows out any heated air at all, not even on the high setting. Do not buy this heater, you will be disappointed. I've tried every setting, read the instructions. It does not work as well as the $25.00 heater I bought at Wal-Mart. I will be shipping it back."
5,Lasko Ceramic Heater,This product came quickly and works great! It was recommended to me by a Relative who had one. I could not locate one in the Florida stores as all sold out. I foundit here with free shipping. Very quiet and heats up large areas quickly.
4,Heats On,"The Lasko 758000 is an attractive floor model heater and heats up almost instantly; the effectiveness of its warmth is for small rooms that are not overly drafty. It is full of safety features and its ceramic , covered heat supply makes it ideal to be used were small children and pets are around. A good value for limited heating in a decorative design for home use."
5,Love it...want to get another,We live in Arizona and our heat pumps are not really made for COLD weather and a few times a year leaves us hanging in the cold. I bought one for myself for Christmas and wish I would have bought 2 while they were on a 50% off sale. Still looking for another deal...
2,Do not buy to heat a large room,"I purchased this to help heat my finished basement. I had previously used a Bionaire heater with thermostat which did a pretty good job. In several hours, it would raise the temperature about 10 degrees. This product cannot do that. In several hours, it raised the temp 4-5 degrees, not enough to be warm at all. I will be returning it."
1,A Christmas gift that went bad,"I bought this for my son-in-law for Christmas to heat a small single-car garage he entertains in. I hadn't heard anything about the heater till yesterday when my daughter finally told me the heater worked just fine, heating the whole room in a fairly short time, for about two weeks, then it just quit working. I would have returned it if they'd told me a little sooner."
5,Great Service!!!!!,I ordered my product at a very reasonable price and expected it much later than it actually arrived! I was so happy with the speed of processing my ordering and delivering it to me. I wish I could order ALL my products from this merchant! Thank you!!!!
1,Misleading,There was a lack of information about this product shows a picture that contains a variety of candy. There was one candy I saw that I wanted the box set for. It was the BUG CITIES!!!! It shows that it has them but it does not. Do not be fooled.
4,As Expected,"This was a present for my niece and nephew who live halfway across the country. I miss them dearly and wanted to send a little something to let them know I love them. They LOVED the crazy candy, and taunted each other with the booger flavored jelly beans. It was perfect, exactly what I expected, and they loved it. My only gripe is that it really was a bit costly."
3,not bad,"You don't get all the candy pictured. And there isn't 30 kinds of candy like the description says. It does come in the box as pictured. I was given some really hard gummi grubs and spongbob chocolate coins instead of tube of powder,dirt and worms,and the hard bugs in a jar.Not bad,but not worth the amount since I can buy all this candy in the store."
5,"Memorable, energetic, compelling","When I attend a new musical and I'm not familiar with the tunes, it's rare that they stay in my head very long, but these songs did. I love the energy and rhythm and the catchiness. Some reviewers here have referenced the ""silly lyrics"" or ""silly plot,"" but it's important to remember that Bombay Dreams is deliberately sending up the Bollywood musical as a genre, and ""silly"" lyrics and plot are a part of that genre. Never mind that; these tunes will get you going on a sluggish day, will get your party rolling, will lift your spirits.As for the reviewer who calls this ""Arabian"" or ""Middle Eastern"" music. Hello? Bombay is in INDIA. Perhaps part of that reviewer's dislike has to do with his/her unfamiliarity with India, its music, culture, films and traditions. Approach it with an open mind and a desire to learn, rather than lumping anything that's different into a wastebasket category of ""foreign."""
4,"Exotic style, nice tune. No lyric included in the booklet!","The music is good, the atmosphere is unique, the song is beautiful. I should give it 5 stars, but there is NO lyric included in the booklet --- Only large pictures of the cast members."
5,Fantastic Dreams,"This CD is just fabulous, ""Like an Eagle"", ""Chayia Chayia"", ""Closer Than Ever"" and ""Wedding Qwalli"" among my favorites. Andrew Lloyd Webber does it again."
3,well worth it for the stunning Rahman music,"Though the lyrics are perfectly rotten, most of the time. I can't remember a worse mismatch of great tunes to misbegotten words since Side Show.It'll be interesting to see what happens when the show gets to Broadway, presumably (one desperately hopes) with an utterly rewritten book, since the London book is a jokey train wreck when it's not being dippily overearnest."
2,Um. Not what the reviews said it was.,"Unless you're into Middle Eastern, Arabian music, it's a little bit of the same feel throughout the show. It doesn't exactly have the stellar songs people says it does. The ballads are gorgeous, the lead female is stunning but other than that... It's a little too much of an Arabian Moulin Rouge... If anything, just download 'Closer Than Ever'."
5,"Beautiful, Original Music","I haven't seen this yet but I have nothing but good things about this. It is coming out in Broadway New York in the year 2004. I too am a fan of A.R. Rahman's work. His work is unique and eleborate. He puts passion into his work and this passion is not common. The background music is exceptional and very nicely done. This music to many people may SOUND arabian but it is NOT. It is Indian music weaved in with American/English sounds. If you want an unique cd that's not like the rest and a cd that has beautiful music, Bombay Dreams is the cd for you."
1,Doesn't work on my digital camera,"I've tried every combination I can think of to get my off-camera flash to sync with my on-camera flash---to no avail. This hot-shoe was not the magic bullet. I just ordered a PC cord with hopes for better results. I have a Canon markII 5D, so if there are any suggestions let me know."
5,Confortable Extremely well made,"Plenty of room, comfortable and balances the weight very well. Great item"
2,"A fantastic work, a mediocre publication","For those looking for Elihu Palmer's work, this surely fits the bill, however the technology used to transpose the pictures of his work into this textual form isn't perfect. As such, there are many, many errors throughout the work making it a very confusing read. Now, an editor could have easily remedied the problem, but the publication states something to the effect of, ""It wouldn't be cost-effective due to the low demand for the book."" Such excuses are unacceptable to me, and I would imagine are also unacceptable to most. Thusly, I give the work two stars."
4,slightly dented but overall okay...,"product was slightly bent (perhaps during shipping) but otherwise new as described. the firepit itself is somewhat low to the ground but i created a brick ring with washed rocks in the center to raise it off of the concrete (or wood if you have a deck) another 4 inches or so which also adds a nice landscape look. the pot has great depth and the outside diameter ring is perfect for keeping ""little hands"" away from the copper pot when it's hot. overall: a very good purchase."
2,"Much Form, Little Substance","This book spends a great deal of time discussing what it suggests one does to architect a system. However, there is very little on how to actually do it. The steps to do things are detailed, but what doing the steps means is not well articulated. Further, some parts of the process are very poorly explained, but still used as a foundation of many other parts of the process.The best practices are simply case studies that really impart no wisdom to the reader (or, at least, to this reader).I tried to ""get something"" out of this book several times, and read it fully twice. However, I'm convinced that there really isn't much there."
3,No bottom cap to catch residue pepper,"It grinds pepper great. The flared bottom keeps the grinder from tipping. However, there is no cap for the bottom to catch residue pepper. I have to keep it on a small plate. I assumed all pepper mills, of this type, would have a removable cap on the bottom. If I had to do this over, I would not have bought this peppermill. Choose one with a bottom pepper catcher. It makes a mess."
4,a worthwhile insight...,"Having had this book on my bookshelf for some months,i had decided to take it with me on my 3 day holiday which proved long enough to finish,this story may start off deceivingly simple but be not fooled there is alot to be learned from this book,while some may find the pace a tad slow there is meaning to this book and a suitable ending that answer enough questions that the book will probably have risen,overall i found it insightful into the human psyche relative to the universe,and our general disposition was cleverly depicted,also our protagonist Matthew is no cliche and neither are the devices the plot uses...I have not really delved into the story as i didnt know much when i started and i found myself pleasantly suprised with the reading material...Mr Wyndham definitely deserves the kudos he got for this book although this book may not be for everyone"
4,Intelligent science fiction,"The story of a young boy who becomes a ""host"" for a visiting alien intelligence. The power of this book is in the way that this far superior intelligence, with no experience of humans or earth, tries to understand our world through the eyes and experiences of a young boy. Definitely a book that makes you think about things that we take for granted."
3,Agree with ZombieKitten re: Kindle Version,"Don't recommend paying $8.99 or really any amount for the Kindle version of this book. It's obvious that a hard copy of Chocky was scanned and converted into Kindle text without any proofreading. More importantly, the ending is missing -- what was inscribed on the swimming medal?"
5,MAKES YOU STOP AND THINK,"The story told in this book is truly mind-boggling, on several fronts. First, there is the adventure of hiking the Appalachian Trail. Secondly, there is the story of a BLIND man doing it! Third, is the whole topic of seeing eye dogs and the bond that develops between them and their owner. It blew me away, that this dog was able to do what he did, thus enabling Bill to complete this hike. Last but not least, it shows what is possible if we put our faith in God. Most of us rely on our own selves--Bill put his faith and trust in God in order to complete this journey. The book is easy to read, short chapters (which I like--makes it easier to pick up and put down), written from the heart. A great gift book!"
5,Blind Courage,"I have been looking for this book a long time. Find it on Amazon. The hardback book was actually signed by the author, wow! Fast delivery, great price...$0.14. Couldn't put the book down. Amazing story. A must to read."
4,"another excellent, easy read","Well written, a good AT book, really illustrates his character as well as the trail community."
2,Incredible story with mediocre delivery,"When I first heard of this story from a friend, I immediately purchased it. As an avid backpacker and general outdoor enthusiast, I found the prospect of a blind man hiking the AT very intriguing. Overall, this was an interesting story and I found some parts to be both entertaining and inspiring. However, as a whole, it fell short of my expectations and was somewhat irritating at times. Bill Irwin is a born-again Christian who attributes God as the driving force behind him making the trip. While I find this relevant and admirable, the author constantly reminds us all how every scenario is God's work and he is but a pawn in the grand scheme. I cannot blame Mr. Irwin for expressing his beliefs, but they seemed to detract from the overall message and became repetitive and preachy at points."
4,Kids movie,My daughter loves scooby doo! This was a great movie for her. It is the same as all the scooby movies so you know what to expect but kids will love it
4,Scooby fan from way back,"I love Scooby. Scooby has been my favorite cartoon since my 1970's childhood. This is one of the newer ones. I prefer the old school episodes, but this one is pretty good and my kids love it."
4,Gotta love Scooby Doo!,Great little movie. good length for my 3 year old. Not too scary but my 12 year old loves it too.
2,Number Two,"This Chapter Three Vol. 2 goes more pop, than the first one. I like it but like the jazz direction of the Vol. 1 better. I always wished they would have done a Chapter Three Vol. 3 but so far the tapes haven't been released. Or wasn't enought material to release. Manfred Man and Mike Hugg need to get back together and make that Chapter Three Vol. 3 or 4."
4,A wonderful surprise,"These books are must reads for all ages. If you love Narnia, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy or any kind of fantasy fiction this series is for you."
3,not that great,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas...it was over her head. She wanted to do the tricks so bad, but couldn't catch on to most of them. She's six years old. Oh well...at least it was cheap."
2,Classic Sonic Game .. Not so fun ..,"I didn't really like this game, I guess if you like all the other sonics, this is basically the same, nothing different. I remember liking Sonic when I was little, but now it doesn't seem like there's a point. You just always press the right arrow and Sonic runs and you just watch him run for like every level (well, I've only tried the first two before I became bored, but I'm quite sure that's how the rest of the levels go)."
1,Ridiculous. Pesky. What the heck?,"Some people seem to REALLY love this Sonic game, but in my opinion (which some people seem to corroborate), the first level is pretty fun, but after that the game gets really ridiculous to try to even beat. The first time I started level 2, it took me probably over 5 lives before I even got half-way through, and I'm not a novice gamer. The game is quite petulant, in that you have to go through the levels exactly their way, or you die. Not a fan, probably will try to sell the game.I wish that the ratings were more realistic. I think that this Sonic Rush game is very literally over-rated."
5,"Old school sega, new blood.","I loved sonic on the sega game gear and on the other sega consoles, so when this came out i went and bought. i was not disappointed. Althought there are times that i get frustrated, its frenetic action never lets down. The main thing is speed. do what you have to do to get through FAST. The backgrounds, enemies, and track blazes by as you go faster. The special zones, though, are my favorite. Here sonic is 3D and so is the landscape (what there is of it) but it still manages to be quite a fun experience. Putting in extra lives is a major help, if you only had the rings, this game would be very hard. this is one of the best DS games that has coome out. if your DS collection does not have this you will be sorely lacking.Here's to sonic the hedgehog!"
3,Annoying music,"Honestly, I would have enjoyed the game more if the music wasn't so annoying.I know you can turn the volume down, but a big part of Sonic games has always been the great music. It is a very important part in setting the atmosphere of the levels.This game, however, has some of the worst music I've ever heard in a Sonic game.The levels are fun, but lack some of the beauty from past titles."
3,Slow down!!,"This game is called Sonic Rush and I believe for good reason! He is flying all over the place and that is not what I'm used to when playing Sonic. To me, you have too much rushing and it just ruined the game play. You're zooming thru water areas and you need to find one of those water bubbles to catch air or you'll just die. And sometimes he's just going so fast you don't even see them. I played this game a few different occasions but because of these reasons, its not really on my list of games to play anymore. (I'm a 27 yr old mother, and I played Sonic on Genesis) My son is very advanced in video games for being just shy of 5 years old. And this was no fun to him either. He'd rather play Batman Arkham Asylum Demo on xbox 360 over and over..."
4,"Fun, but a little challenging","This is a great Sonic game, and the speed is incredible! The graphics are quite nice, though I have had some problems in the way of jumping high enough to clear certain barriers. Overall I would consider it money well spent if you spent it on this game, great fun and moderately easy."
5,"Really, Really fun game!!!",My 8 year old daughter also loves this game!!! She likes the two characters Sonic and Blaze... She likes jumping in the air and doing cool tricks... She also likes the music and she would recommend this to a child her age.... She also like to draw from the characters and the boards they give her great ideas....
2,"Too easy, then too hard","On the first zone it's just too easy: you run through the level, then you win. On the second level I can't get past the first water. too easy then too hard.(review by my nine-year-old)."
2,Not as fun as I expected....,"After reading all the other reviews, I expected a great game. I have to admit, the last Sonic game I played was the Genesis one. Maybe the franchise has gone other places, but I personally just didn't like playing this game. Specifically, my biggest problem was not being able to see the levels very well. The colors are very muted and often have little contrast. One of the things I love about most other DS games (the new Super Mario Brothers, for example) is how vibrant and easy on the eyes the levels are. With this game, Sonic (or Blaze), along with the path you are running on, seems to blend into the background. That might be fine for some games, but when a game's emphasis is on speed and rapidly moving through the levels, there needs to be better visual cues. Just my 2 cents."
3,great game but not for a small screen,All the elements of the classic 2D we all fell in love with but it moves so fast on such a small screen that I didn't feel any semblance of a sense of control over what sonic was doing.
5,sonic rush will blow you away,the awesome gameplay and incredible speed makes this game rock if your a sonic fan and you own a ds get this game
5,fun game at a bargen price,"we love this game me and my daughter pass it back and forth on the boss challenge great use of the duel screen, straight forward, pick up and play feel very nice!!"
2,Fast and nothing else,"You do not do anithing,it moves fast without you pushing but one button. when you do interact it is very repetitive.I did not like it at all."
1,DON'T DO IT!!,"I purchased a basket from this company on December 13, 2004. They stated that it was guaranteed Christmas delivery. Today is December 29th and my friend has still not received the package. So much for Christmas delivery and the element of surprise. Iemailed the company and I was sent a standard email notifying me that a customer service rep would contact me within 24 hours. It never happened. I called the company and to rectify the problem they credited me the shipping charges. Woopy. I felt they should have refunded me completely. Oh well. Live and learn."
5,Sweet gifts,"For the Grandmother on her birthday. The lady has it all, so this was a sweet surprise! Beautiful and she called three times to tell me how impressed she was."
2,Disappointing,"Was so excited to read a book by an author from my home town, but so many spelling and grammatical mistakes, and slow story made this a big disappointment."
3,be careful,"Minn Kota MKP 9 Prop Nut 3/8"" (A)Be careful ordering this kit. The size is correct (for 3-5/8"" motors) but the photo shows plastic thumb nuts and lock washers, which are not compatible with 3-5/8"" motors (like the Vector 55/3x) that use the MKP-32 prop. These motors require the Ny-Loc nuts and flat washers as shown in the MKP-34 kit, but that kit is for 4"" motors. Minn Kota CS could not tell me which parts are actually in the MKP-9 kit. The MKP-32 prop comes with the correct nut, washer and pin, but they don't tell you that."
4,Good but not her best,"Sharyn McCrumb is a top writer. This book as usual is one of her best though not the best. But worth buying & reading. Sharyn has a way with writing that is top notch. This book is a Elizabeth MacPherson book & it takes place after her husband, Cameron, died.Her brother has bought a old house that has the old owner still living there. And he is doing something that no one knows about. Nor does the reader."
2,A Bust,"I've read and enjoyed other McCrumb books, but this was my first Elizabeth MacPherson novel. I enjoyed several of the characters (Jack Dolan was particularly colorful), but I just didn't find the plot line very involving. The ""outlaws'"" crusades were more like adolescent pranks and failed to pull the story together. Other than a few cute characters, there isn't much to recommend in this one."
3,Estrogen Inspired Seekers of Justice,"I was really hoping for a lot more from the book - enjoyed the revenge of the Outlaws, but never fully understood the motivation. Maybe I was hoping the PMS Outlaws were truly raving, raging, squads of estrogen inspired justice seekers? Defensible and forgiveable on account of hormomal histronics. Ms. McCrumb has certainly done better than this. LOVED Frankie Silver, so I am a fan. But Elizabeth can stay in the asylum and Bill can stay clueless and Cameron may very well have run away (and I might even offer shelter). More fluff than anything else, an unlikely story. - The Outlaw Mamalinda"
1,Erratic plot contrivances,"I have enjoyed many of McCrumb's novels, and this one has some interesting characters and snappy dialogue; but it is a mess! The several plots never dovetail, never make any sense. And the whole Hillman Randolph/Larry Garrison business is a total red herring. If someone can tell me what that was all about, I'd be glad to know. What an irritating disappointment this novel is."
3,Read and Relate,"The book I read today, ""The PMS Outlaws"" made me feel like we're all a little crazy. The sections of this book with the asylum in them were incredibly sad to me because I found myself identifying with the crazy people, their theories, and their obsessions.The entire book, in my opinion, had much to do with beauty. Discussed within the book, beauty makes the world go 'round, and those who do not have it are sadly out of luck. This theory is sadly not too far from the truth. In the book, we see that those who are beautiful, young, and thin get most anything they want, even one young seductress who lures men into her web and then, with her partner, handcuffs and robs them. On the other hand, ugly people get nothing, many of them thrown into a mental institution, which they claim is because of their ugliness.The book is worth your money and time. I strongly suggest it."
4,Entertaining!,"Actually I still have 50 pages to go, but I wanted to review now anyway. As always, I am enjoying the newest Elizabeth novel, with the additional adventures of her brother and his law partner. However, like Elizabeth, I am in denial! I want Cameron back and soon."
4,Several stories told,"This is my second McCrumb novel, and the second one in which the hapless Bill buys property. It made me wonder whether he does that in every novel. I like McCrumb so much that I'm going to go back to read the rest in sequence. The various plots and subplots were interesting, though I agreed with an earlier reviewer that the PMS outlaws' escapades seemed weakly motivated. Still, the incident that started it all was quite satisfying."
4,The PMS Outlaws,"The MacPherson clan is at it again. Elizabeth hospitalized for depression. Bill buying a house complete with past owner in place. And dear, eccentric Cousin Geoffrey (who's probably the smartest and most loyal of the group) coming to the rescue again. It was also fun to find out what really made Milo the way he was. Thoroughly enjoyed it and have passed it along to first one friend and then another. Too bad about Cameron, though. I really liked him."
2,The first - and last - novel I will read from this series...,I hope her other books are better than this one. The characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical and the plots are too far-fetched. I read this for a book group and had to force myself to finish.
3,I really missed the McPherson series,"I've always enjoyed the McPherson series written by Sharyn McCrumb. It is a lot more light-hearted than the other mystery series she writes. Elizabeth spends most of this novel in a sanitarium, while her brother buys a Tara-like mansion as a home for himself and his partner as well as their law office. AP Hill has her own problems. A former college aquaintance is terrorizing the male chauvinists of the South with a woman she broke out of prison. She and AP are not friends but the outlaws keep her informed of what they are doing. This book is thoroughly enjoyable, I'm glad she did not give up on this series."
3,An interesting movie,I also saw this movie before I entered the Marines...I just wish I had the time while I was in boot camp to meditate. I really enjoyed Darren Magavin's portrayal of the DI and Jan-Michael Vincent was at his best I think. Worth watching.As a side note...The Marine Corps did accept draftees for a short period during the Vietnam War due to high casualty rates and lack of volunteers...that was in the mid to late 60's.
4,VHS movie Tribes,The product was in very good shape for its age. The movie was shipped quickly. I highly recommend this product
3,One for the completists among us (this means you),"This had been on my ""To Read"" shelf since 1990 (I know because I was using the sales receipt as a bookmark). A biased, glowing look at the Pythons, it is full of useless but amusing trivia, which is exactly what Python fanatics like myself buy these books for. As a history, it's nowhere near the level of Hill and Weingard's Saturday Night (a look at the making of Saturday Night Live and its myriad cast members), but as histories of the series goes, it's about as good as it gets. There's also a complete vid/bib/discography in the back for those completists out there."
2,What KIND of red peppers are they?,"As a new foodie wanting to learn to cook more with lots of interesting peppers, this is the kind of product that is so confusing. WHAT KIND OF RED PEPPERS ARE THEY?"
4,"Good chilis, buy a smaller container","These were good peppers and I used them when cooking several thai/asian inspired dishes. They make good heat but nothing too crazy. They're hard to chop so I usually powderize them in my blender before adding to sauces. My only complaint is that they should be shipped with a bag of silica b/c after a while, they got a little stale. Because they're dried, a 3.5oz bag is a HUGE amount of chilis."
2,Not spicy,"Very disappointed by the lack of spice in these. Don't know if it's because of poor packaging during shipping or just not-so-spicy peppers, but these were no more spicy than crushed red pepper flakes sold at any supermarket."
2,"Average Quality, Not Hot",I wanted these to grind up and make a powder to heat up soups and lunches at work. The quality is pretty average. There were a lot that were browning and I decided to cut open the peppers before I ground them. There were a lot that had black and rotting seeds. They were also not completely dry and the powder had to dry out overnight. I would not recommend this product or buy it again.
5,Excellent buy,I looked at several other Oxy-Acetylene tourch kits..I settled on the Campbell Hausfeld because I have owned several other products made by them..Received the kit and was very pleased. Everything they said it would be. Kit contains everything ya need except the adaptor to hook up to the Acetylene tank but that was no problem..Went to local supplier and for a few bucks purchsed the adaptor. Yes I would recommend this kit to anyone.
3,"Nice watch, nice price, but...","...beware the warranty. Amazon is not, in TAG Heuer's case, an ""authorized dealer"" for their watches. This makes the manufacturer's warrany void, and the vague Amazon provided warranty is not the same. I found this out when, after giving this watch as a gift, that TAG wouldn't even talk to me about service or parts. I tried to get the two extra links that TAG provides to their AD customers free of charge, only to find that I couldn't even buy them. Eventually, after much painful & multi-layered persuation, Amazon shared the cost with me for the two extra after-market links, at a whopping $200, purchased on Ebay. Amazon also never made good on their promise to send me a detailed warranty on paper. So, buyer beware. The watch itself is very nice and pretty impressive in-person. Probably best to go for whatever extra dollars and buy from an AD when in this price range."
2,Not up to expectations,This time piece has been returned. First time I've ever been unhappy with anything ordered from Amazon. Was not packed properly and missing cards & guarentt for watch.
3,sad shape,"Although I bought this book used, I didn't realize that meant it would be falling apart. When I took it out of the envelope, there were pages falling out. They are currently being held in place by a paper clip. This was one of my first purchases on Amazon. I suppose I will need to be more weary of ""used"" descriptions. But I can read the book for class, so it serves its purpose."
5,Esoteric Awesomeness,"Anyone interested in Martial arts, Kundalini, and the esoteric arts in general will enjoy this book too a supreme degree. I know i did. One of my favorite books."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This book is not for everyone. If you are not familiar with enlightenment or martial arts you may find it confusing and ridiculous at times. I would only recommend this book to people who remotely understand what he is talking about. However, I found the chapter on meditation interesting. The various meditations were entertaining to perform. If I wasn't so dense about enlightenment and martial arts, I probably would have better understood the book and found it more enjoyable."
3,Not what I expected...,"I thought this book shared many interesting ideas. However, some were either too far over my head, or I just didn't believe. I'm a pretty open minded person and I still had a hard time swallowing some of the things mensioned in this book, but for the most part it is very interesting, and provokes a lot of thought."
3,Read just for kicks,"This book is something out of this world. Most of time you are saying to yourself, ""I can't believe he just said that!"" Chapter 3 and 5 sick out in my mind the most. I found the book interesting, but very confusing. I would have to read the book serveral times to fully understand it. But then again, I am not a ninja master."
2,"interesting, but out there","The book should be interesting to anyone who is familiar with ninpo or is interested in chi or meditation. On the other hand, from what I remember of the book (its been awhile), the author claims to have dreamed walked, met famous dead people, eaten demons, and had sex with one particular woman to open her to energy or something of the sort (I'm sure many guys will find that line handy). Add in the parts where he talks about drug use and similiar things and it starts to make a little more sense. Still, it has useful information.>>>> UPDATE: someone gave me the advice to reread the book and upon looking at it, it is as i remember. it is a good read but he talks about dream walking with his teachers, telepathy, notes that celebacy is a sign of immaturity and avoiding dangerous spirits is just propaganda. he says he has projected images of the crypt keeper to others which scared them into avoiding him. there are useful ideas in there but take it all with a grain of salt"
1,This book is not about a Ninja Master,"Glenn Morris' book is way out there. This is not a book about a ""Ninja Master"" but a hobbyist (his words) of Ninpo. If you are into kundalini, asteral planes and learning how to see peoples' auras (which he taught several people to do in 10 minutes) buy this book. If you want to learn about Ninpo, read books written by the current Soke, Masaaki Hatsumi or if you can find them, books by Shoto Tanemura."
4,Adv Comp Review,"This book is extremely insightful, but only if you allow yourself to visualize Mr. Morris's ideas and suggestions. I, personally, do not find myself very interested in mysticism and all that Eastern stuff, but, I am not closed-minded. Using his own experiences, Morris clarifies certain ways one can find the ""power"" within himself. I am very bad, honestly, at keeping my mind clear, so the strategies, such as meditation were not made for me. With tools at his side, such as humor and sarcasm, Morris clears the path for any person on their way to becoming a ""Ninja Master,"" revealing some of the do's and don'ts. Although the book was a bit confusing for me, I think it was well written for those whom it was intended for and can be of much use to certain individuals."
5,Lights a fire under you.,Wow! Few books on the martial arts are as useful as this. Mr Morris talks about things we all think about but are afraid to ask. His instrunctions and experiences are invaluable to the seekers among us. Read carefully and enjoy his somewhat strange sense of humor.
5,One of the best books on real ninjutsu out there.,"There is a lot of bad information out there about real ninjutsu and the kundalini path of enlightenment. This book is NOT one of those. This book is one of the best sources of information on these subjects that you'll find without going to Japan. It's entertainingly written, full of information that you will find nowhere else, and pulls no punches at all. Martial arts books don't come any better than this. It's a book (with bibliography!) that is an example of what these books are supposed to be like.Very highly recommended."
4,Credit where credit is due?,"Overall, this is a well-produced CD, showcasing the varied talents of Steve Farmer. Two contrasting songs, ""Journey to the Darkside of the Mind"" and ""Journey Sojourn Soul,"" taken together, capture the essence of Farmer's style and are reminiscent of his best work with the Amboy Dukes.My appreciation of this CD is tainted, however, by a nagging suspicion that there are some uncredited / unacknowledged musicians lurking beneath some of the best tracks.For example, on ""Shadows on the Wall"" and ""St. Phillips Friend,"" the instrumental track sounds identical to previous recordings of these songs by Babylonian Tiles (released on the same St. Thomas label). In addition, on several other tracks, the signature keyboard playing of Babylonian Tiles' Bryna Golden seems to be in evidence. I suspect that the other band members are in there as well. However, other than a vague mention of Golden as backup vocalist, Babylonian Tiles is given no credit for performances or arrangements."
3,"Wow, far OUT, man!","To my mild surprise, I'm finding this CD actually listenable; might even play it a second time. Steve Farmer and his band are a real time capsule of the 1960's psychedelic scene. Sounds like the Amboy Dukes never broke up! The lead guitar even sounds like a less-skilled version of Ted Nugent's sound back then. (I wonder what Ted thinks of this album?) Some of the mystical lyrics and ""wow, man!"" sounds are a bit laughable, but I'm laughing WITH them, not AT them! The old Dukes tracks sure take me back, but darnit, I was hoping to finally learn Why is a Carrot more Orange than an Orange! Maybe on the next album?A true Amboy Dukes reunion with Nugent would be most welcome. Maybe they could tour with a reunited Strawberry Alarm Clock?"
3,Bluegrass Cowboy,"If you like western lyrics put to the bluegrass sound you will love this CD.We have all come to expect a certain type of music associated with a cowboy tune and this definately is a veer from the norm.The musicians are excellent, the arrangements great and Don and Peter sound wonderful.When can one say..........""It's different""."
4,Looks good!,"Don't forget the small vscrews, I almost did. But until now my 306 lbs. body is comfortably supported, so don't worry it weight capacity (If following the instructions to the tee)."
3,Bentwood Chair and Ottoman,"The product arrived on time and in good shape. The directions were vague but understandable. Remember to insert the support screws into the stitched material slots, otherwise, the screws will rip the pads."
2,Like second-hand furniture,"The chair arrived in what can best be described as battered condition. One of the dowels holding it together was broken, and apparently the factory uses a heat gun to make holes in the edge of the fabric, which was sloppily done, creating a tear in the fabric."
3,chair,"Unfortunately, this chair is not going to workout for the purpose I had intended for it and seems to be on a par with premium patio furniture. I will be keeping it however. Assembly was relatively easy as those endeavors go and all in all it is a nice looking piece and sturdy. On a final note the chair that I had intended for this one to replace, I built myself for a very specific purpose. At this price it's a good deal."
5,Very Fine Tuned To Our Children's Needs,"Anyone who teaches preschoolers as I do, or has preschoolers at home, or who comes in contact with them for any reason knows how important it is for children to understand the need and support for one another. This album gives them every bit of that in the most wonderful way. Songs with lyrics and music that children can easily follow, arrangements that arouse interest, great singing and playing, and terrific activities all add up to entertainment and learning about the need for each other.This album, ""I Need You And You Need Me"" is one more example of how fine tuned Bobby Susser is to our children's needs, and how naturally he gets to the children through every one of his songs. Don't deprive your children of ""I Need You And You Need Me."""
4,"A nice, comfy, and hip-ly metallic wedge.","This is a great buy with the sale price--the bronze is a bit darker in person than I thought it appeared online, but it looks great. It felt true-to-size (on my wide-ish foot) and was comfortable right out of the box, but it does take a bit of getting used to the unflexing sole. Looks very nice with white, off-white, brown, and black, too--very versatile."
1,offensive translation,"I am sickened to have received a translation of Quid Tibi Vis that includes the infamous ""N"" word. This word choice is illogical and crude. I feel betrayed by the translator and the publisher. It will be a long time before I feel I can trust Penguin's books again."
1,Unraveling as we speak,"The pants came of thick material, but the top and bottom are frayed as are the pockets and there are loose threads that undo the seams if pulled by anything. I suppose you need to use nail polish to hold the threads which will make it look worse. There are tags that say the shorts are new, but I've seen better things in a second hand store. I got one for me and a different size as a gift, and both pants came this way."
4,"the underrated, underappreciated Wallflowers do it again","I have been a Wallflowers' fan since they broke into the mainstream circa 1996, and this new CD definitely does not disappoint. I'd read rave reviews of it in a few different magazines, but still wasn't prepared for it to be as great as it is. I just thought it was wonderful that they were releasing a new album, and that it would be at least pretty good. It's a lot more than ""pretty good""! If you're a Wallflowers' fan, you will love this new CD, and if you aren't a fan you should get it anyway, because you will be a fan after you hear it. Either way, it's great music, period.A lot of music being released these days is mind-numbing, inane and awful. This CD is full of songs that won't insult your intelligence. Thanks Jakob, et al, for not letting us down!! (All songs written by Jakob Dylan.) Can't wait for the next one, but in the meantime the new songs are substantial enough to last a while."
3,fun but disappointing,"The video is very interesting, with wonderful footage of catching fish. I was glad I watched, but thought the video could have been much more. I was disappointed that there was almost no INFORMATION. I could seldom tell exactly where they were, they did not describe what permissions, if any, they needed to fish in specific areas, they did not discuss gear, etc. They did show many of the flies they used. I was curious about costs (they mentioned they did not fish private waters that cost 300 US dollars per day). How did they buy their jeep? What roads were they on? How did they arrange camping? Under what conditions did they use nymphs vs dry flies vs streamers? What US fly patterns worked? What new patterns did they learn about? How did they learn about them? And so forth. In summary, I recommend the video, but if you view it, expect to have many unanswered questions. Be sure to watch the bonus section. It seemed to have a bit more narration. I want to go to Patagonia."
5,David Wang,"Scruton's book on Kant is, in my view, the best book available on Kant if the goal is to get a quick overview of the philosopher's ""Critical System."" This is a short and concise book and it does the impossible: summarize Kant's three critiques (of Pure Reason, of Practical Reason and of Judgment) in a pocket-sized book. And it is very readable. I generally really enjoy Scruton's writings; he is one of the few commentators who can write about philosophical matters in an understandable fashion for the common reader. This is doubly amazing since Scruton himself is a first rate philosopher..."
5,Interesting and no dumbed down account of Kant,"This book may serve as both an introduction to Kant or, for those with interest but little time to tackle Kant, an excellent summary of the key arguments that made Kant famous. Scruton is in obvious awe of Kant's contribution to philosophty (rightly so) and astonishingly presents Kant without a lot of the impenetrable phrases Kant cooked up to explain himself."
5,"Great Product, Great Price, Super Fast Service","I didn't even think the movie I ordered would be available anywhere, but this seller had it on VHS. The product was brand new, just as advertised, and arrived quite promptly. I'd be happy to purchase more items from this Amazon seller. Thanks!"
5,"Excellent Book, Excellent Instructor","I have had the pleasure of not only reading the book, but taking the author's class!!! Not only is he a fine instructor, but his book mirrors his teaching style. I hope readers enjoy his book as much as I have. If you want to learn C++ this a great book to get you started!!!!"
2,Chicago Cubs apparel,"I was impressed with the ease of order and the speedy manner in which I received. I was so excited to get these as I could not find for my husband and he is a die hard Cub fan. However, upon my husband wearing these 3 times, the enter middle seam ripped out. I have already had to sew them up and was extremely disappointed with the quality."
2,hmmm...wonder why the return policy is limited to 60 days?,"because just around the 60 day mark, the chime turned into a terrible noise like something dying. I just turned that feature off and continued enjoying the dispenser, but a month later (3 months after original purchase), the thing is spewing soap non-stop. Wasted lots of soap this way. Changing the batteries didn't help. Soap just flows out until there's none left. To maintain some customer satisfaction, Sharper Image should consider backing their products with a better return policy or providing some better quality control."
1,Works when it feels like...,Works when it feels like it. All I can say. I finally gave up and it sits in the closet.
2,Disappointed,"My husband bought me the Soap Genie for Christmas and it was my favorite gift! I immediately filled it with lotion and joyfully used it every morning. Never had a problem until yesterday when it stopped dispensing altogether, quite the opposite of other complaints. Batteries work, little pulleys inside work, but nothing comes out. Thought it might be clogged so I tried adding water. Nothing. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. Of course we have no receipt and paperwork is nowhere to be found...the only way to get it fixed it to return it, no instructions (on internet) on troubleshooting."
2,Soap Genie clogs up and the soap tube isn't accessible,"This thing was easy to use and actually pretty cool for the first month; who thought that washing your hands could be fun? As soon as we switched from a very diluted liquid soap to one the consistency of lotion, though, the dispenser became clogged up. The tube isn't accessible (to try to unclog it), which is ridiculous for something this expensive. Guess we'll just go back to hiring someone to dispense the soap for us (no, not really!). Seriously, though, it became useless pretty quickly and is a waste of money."
1,Not So Sharper Image,This is the last item I will ever purchase from Sharper Image...it broke the second week I had it...spewing hand soap at will and not when I placed my hand under the infrared sensor. It's pure crap. Stay away!!!
3,Great music but...,This studio recording makes for a great DVD as I love Hilario Duran's music especially with such a tight band including Paquito D'Rivera. However I can't figure out why the entire recording is not of standard recording quality: this is subresolution and the grainy edges on all objects are visible as if its VGA quality stretched hence only 3* rating. It affects the enjoyment of this... I changed my TV's aspect ratios but still no relief and I use the best blu ray players available (Oppo). The sound quality is fine however. Buyers should be aware although it is watchable. All other video editing is fine also. One expects a decent picture in a recent studio recording. Still reccommended. Maybe better watching on a PC rather than big tv.
3,"Mr. Probst, sci-fi is NOT...","Science fiction is many things, but one thing it is NOT is intended to reaffirm the ""traditional"" way of things. Sci-fi is intended to ""burn the motherhood statement"" - meaning that well-written science fiction challenges, rather than reaffirms, the old-style traditional values that people normally cling to.To say that a science-fiction novel offends your oh-so-traditionalist values is actually a considerable compliment even if you aren't aware of it; it means the writer's doing his JOB."
1,not good,"not good. I mean what Sci-fi is coming to. Even as a eleven year old I have read better Science fiction. Basilisk Station, don't even start. Honor as a character is flawless. she is not at all realistic. As for this book it is bigoted. it puts down Christians and over-amplifies the prejudice against women. The story, if it were set in that time, would not at all happened that way."
1,Overindulgence,"This book, like the first, is a gross display of self-indulgence by the author. His desire for a dominatrix does not make good reading for the rest of us. His untouchable perfect beauty fixation is quite disturbing. This book is certainly science fiction, with an emphasis on fiction. The author watched much too much Star Trek; page after page is dedicated tolaborious descriptions of the spaceship's mechanical workings. The problem is that these descriptions are merely techno-babble with no science whatsoever. I regret Amazon's grading system does not allow a zero star score."
1,offensive,"I find this book offensive. It degrades my religious beliefs. As a traditional catholic I started reading Basilisk staion and did'nt like it. Then I read Honor of the Queen and apparently, the Grayson's are right"
5,One I didn't have,"I would reccommend this book to anyone who loves SciFi and adventures. It's one from a complete collection. Good day to have a book to read, cup of coffee, & a fireplace to keep me warm. Thanks"
3,His second book needs work to weed out excess words in all of his chapters. After a successful first book this was disappointing,"I gave his first a WOW, but this book his editor needed to reel back his overly descriptive passages. Since noone did that the author became even more descriptive. Boring chapters lead to bored readers."
4,Honor wins one for women without being politically correct,"Another fine book from Weber. His Honor Harrington is one of those characters that you wind up really caring about. I would like to see her go up against Capt Picard, she could mop the floor with him without breaking a sweat.Highly recomended."
5,The #1 SCI-FI novel in the last ten years!!!!!!,As a sub sailor I READ a LOT and Honor Harrington (the heroine) is one of the BEST books written. I have 3 copies and 2 are worn out! Way to go David Weber and I WANT MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Females are NOT Subservient!,"When Honor is given the duty of contacting the newly discovered civilisation on Grayson's Star, she has to doubt the wisdom of her superiors for the planet is highly patriarcal. Not only that, the women are highly protected for the native soils are highly poisonous to human kind and not all babies were brought to term. But the Graysonians are not so stiff necked as to fail to recognise the virtues of Honor when their traditional enemies on the planet of Masada launch yet another Final War. This time they have back up from a more powerful enemy though as the People's Republic of Haven turns its eye upon the domes o Grayson."
5,Honor rocks in an outstanding sequel!,"David Weber follows up On Basilisk Station with The Honor of the Queen, Book Two in his oustanding Honor Harrington series. Honor is sent on a diplomatic mission and finds herself caught up in a religious war between the planets Grayson and Masada. And she must also deal with misogynistic attitudes from the Graysons, as equality of the sexes is unheard of in their world. The People's Republic of Haven gets into the action, as the Masadans seek to form an alliance with the ""Peeps."" THOTQ is an excellent sequel that surpasses the first book (no easy task). Honor is a strong female lead character, and the author has created many other believable characters as well, such as the Protector, the head of state of Grayson. Weber has created a great science ficiton hero in Honor Harrington, and the Harrington novels are a solid space opera series."
4,So when will this particular book be available for Kindle?? Book 3 is already available but I want to read them in order.,"Read this in PB yrs ago and want to revisit yhe series on Kindle, but only in order. Hence my question, when? For this book."
5,Outgunned fighting impossible odds,commander who puts her command at risk to save a planet. Honor shows what a gutsy commander can do. Also shows she is human when she encounters what has happened to POW's from her Navy. It is well worth the time to get into the series. Read them in order if you can. Makes Star Trek look tame and no character development.
2,So Big!!!,"The medium is really big and it is the smallest size they have to offer an adult.It fits like a extra large. So sad, it is a radical shirt."
4,Beautiful,"I ordered this tshirt for my 5 year old. The picture is very accurate; the tshirt is quite beautiful! It's good quality material as well, not too thin or flimsy. I ordered her a child small as she wears a size 6. It fits just right; I wish I had ordered one size bigger. I would recommend this shirt for anyone who loves horses."
1,More specifications,"The seller of this product should specify that the size of it is very large, and does not say.I take a big surprise when I received that is really big and I could not use, I had to give it away."
1,What?!,"Do not buy this. It is false advertising. If you get it you will be shocked to learn that there is NO moon, NO shadow, and NO WOLVES!"
1,Drivel,Being a parent myself I cannot think that anyone could truly be so uninformed. It's only saving grace is the fact that it burns.
1,Waste of Time,This autor needs to be stoped. And we should pray for all of those that have such weak will sand minds as to beleive joan's insanity. She could be one of the false profits.
4,Great Watch,"However the bezel does not move as is says in the product description, but I love it still."
4,Cool sunglasses,"They look and fit perfectly, I don't give them the full stars because I imagine them a little bit bigger but thats ok. Good quality"
5,absolutely unique,"It is a fantastic book , a kind of enciclopedia for weavers, there is nothing similar around.Marvellous"
4,Worthwhile slog,"Millar's conclusions are filled with resonance and provide an important perspective. The evolution of Republican institutions at the dawn of the Imperial period, The level of democracy and it's coexistence with autocratic rule, ...etc. are issues that Millar explores as no one else can. Wading through his summarization of epigraphic nuggets is difficult enough, and one can only imagine the effort Millar must have devoted to sifting the vast body of evidence. We owe him our gratitude for this. I did have the sense that he sometimes over-reached in supporting his points: criticizing Tacitus for his focus on senatorial process (and excluding participation of the Roman people) seems unfair as Tacitus was a senator writing about what he was in a position to know. Overall, however, the book provides a unique opportunity for very rewarding reflection."
4,Great if you like small breasts,"I really think that this is more like a three-and-a-half-star production. While all attractive--especially Charlie Laine and the Genie herself, Tanya James--as a whole, the women mostly aren't my cup of tea. If you're into women with small natural breasts, you'll probably love it--everyone here fits that description.It gets a rating this high from me primarily because of the sheer volume of explicit nudity--pretty unusual for a Peach release. And it actually is shot beautifully in parts, with great scenery."
4,for the most part great,"got these for my newborn, tried all kinds of pacifiers for my first two but they never took to pacifiers. my now one-month-old has been glued to the nuks. the only flaw is the red marks it leaves, but it is worth the slight annoyance. the marks dont stay long when the paci is out. another thing i like about them is the cute prints they have for them."
1,Leaves Red Marks Around Mouth,"I really wanted to like this set of pacifiers bought offline (they weren't cheap!!!), but they are the only model of pacifier we have that leave indentation marks around our daughter's mouth. I guess it's the harder plastic and design. :( We use these as our ""last resort"" ones, when all the other pacifiers are either lost or being washed. I'm sort of shocked by the positive reviews and recommend trying out other brands which are sooooo much softer on the mouth and skin!"
5,Nuk Pacifier,Our son loves it! They gave him at the hospital when he was born and its his favorite pacifier so far!
5,Baby loves them,"My 2-month-old loves these NUK pacifiers. I had a couple of transparent ones for her before this, and they were hard to find because they disappear into crib sheets etc. (seriously). So the colors are a nice change."
5,The best!,These pacifiers are the best and the only ones my daughter will use. I like the looks of them too. I will be buying many more in the coming months.
4,"Good pacifier, misleading listing regarding colors","I ordered these because I wanted the BPA-free newborn size, but I was hoping not to have too many that would be pink for my son. The listing says ""Colors may vary, you may receive in one of the following colors: white and green, pink and white or blue and white,"" however, we received purple and pink entirely from several orders and they were very vibrant colors, not pastel. Just be aware that the colors may not be the same as what was posted. Amazon, however, has excellent customer service and offered me a refund for the inconvenience!"
4,This has some great vocal moments!,"When I first found out about this album, it was already out of print. I paid the price ($40.00) because I love Billy Paul's music. This was worth it! The first part of the album just amazes me! I wish the instrumentation was better (no horns). But the lead and back up vocals are superb! I have always wanted a live version of ""Love Buddies"". They delivered! Great live verisions of ""Billy's Back Home"", ""This Is Your Life"", ""War of the Gods"". This is the perfect compliment to another out of print live CD by him called ""Your Songs"" (Live in France 2000). That one has killer versions of ""Only The Strong Survive"" and ""It's Too Late""! BILLY PAUL IS MUCH MORE THAN JUST ""ME AND MRS JONES""!"
5,best cooler for under $20 !!!,"i just got this little cooler at target for about $19.00 i live in los angeles and right now is summer time, this is the best cooler for the money i have ever had i filled the cooler about 5:00 p.m. one day with beer and ice got it to work the next day kept it inside my car the whole day after work me and a couple of co-worker had a few beers the ice lasted for about 27 hours and that's in temperatures almost hitting 100 degree i'm really happy with it ,the shape is pretty cool and is made in U.S.A.!!!!!!,for under $20 you can't go wrong!!!! great job igloo!!!!!"
3,"Nice, but doesn't keep ice frozen for very long","I bought this to keep drinks cold on a camping trip. The cooler is light and portable and the shape is nice for bottled water. However, ice wouldn't stay frozen for more than 6-8 hours. It was kept in the shade and the outside temps were around 85F. I think it's overpriced for how poor performing it is at keeping things cold. Pretty much any less expensive personal cooler will keep drinks cold for just as long."
3,Average,"I found this book to be really good, but the sequel was so bad that I wasn't even interesting in continuing on to the third book. That left a very bad taste in my mouth."
5,Amazing!,"Simply an amazing series, the battles are described in amazing detail, and the charecter developement is wonderful. My only complaint is that the author goes a bit overboard with the endowments... I can't really remember if so and so has 500 endowments of metabolism."
5,Entertaining,"There are few fantasy books out there with as good a plot as the Runelords. When I read fantasy, I don't read every single line and dissect what it could mean, and how well it is written. Instead I let myself get drawn in. This is a fantasy book, and that is what fantasies are for. Few fantasy books can establish their reality as well, and hold to that reality. Highly recommended as a book difficult to put down(unless you are a word/sentence/paragraph/chapter critic without the desire to use your own imagination.)"
1,"Boring, repetitive, and did I say boring?","I bought this book based on the wonderful reviews, and the premise. The endowments are an interesting twist. But I must agree with others that for those characters that have endowments of wit, they are remarkably stupid. I found the writing style dull and boring, and I made it only one third of the way through the book before putting it aside in disgust. One of the worst books I've ever read, and thats saying something considering I've read fantasy for about 25 years. If you want a great fantasy read, try Anne Bishop."
3,decent,"I enjoyed the book (an advance reading copy) and look forward to the sequel, BUT... it is a very ""busy"" book. The author keeps introducing new things and doesn't give you a chance to catch up. I would rather go a little more slowly in an epic and have some time to enjoy the scenery and get to know the characters but entire new groups of characters seems to be introduced every second page. David Farland does show great promise though and I'd certainly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys fantasy."
4,Different,"This applies to the entire series. I like the use of the rune powers, but I'm not thrilled with the ending of the final book. I've heard he is working on more involving the children of Gaborn and something about a movie deal? While these are good, I could think of much better fantasy series to head to the big screen."
5,New Idea,"I always have to give a lot of credit to authors who are able to see a genre of writing and make it their own by introducing a new and fresh aspect to look at. So often I am left feeling bored and tired by the same old wizard and dragon stories, that I am always welcome to books such as these that breathe a breath of fresh air into the field of fantasy. The idea of supplementary magic in this book to me is the central reason why the book is good. The author has created a new ""magic"" as it were, and how he tells about it, and introduces it in this book was well done. The writing is not super heavy, so this book can be enjoyed by all, but I enjoyed the ideas that went behind the making of this book, and it is those ideas that I applaud. If you are reading goodkind and jordan right now, and see all the consistencies between those 2 authors, and perhaps also to Tolkein, look to this author and this book to help you out of your doldrum."
2,When does the game come out?,"As I read this book I kept being nagged by two thoughts. One, that the story wasn't very smooth. I sometimes felt that 'I' could have gone through and rewritten some of it to produce better dialogue and transition and I don't consider myself a talented writer. And two, I kept asking myself when is the role-playing game that goes along with this book gonna reach the stores? It just has a feel to it like David Farland is the DM for a game and is weaving every player's moves into the storyline. I'm glad I made it to the end but I doubt that I will read the other books in this series."
1,Okay story.........badly told,"Anyone who likes traditonal Fantasy, be it Lord of the Rings, Shannara, or Recluse, will find this book dull. The story is fast paced...but I couldn't get really involved in what the characters were doing. So much is put on describing magic and it's abilities...the characters are not developed as much as they should be.I bought the first two books thinking the series will be good due to other reviews. I will not be reading book two or the others to follow. I WARN you to be careful with this book. You will either enjoy it or hate it."
2,"Interesting magic,terrible editing. High-school plot,people.","David Farland has potential but he needs to learn how to write a grammatical sentence, or at least get an editor that knows how. His characters don't always act realistically - several have frank multiple personality disorder. One can only suppose Mr. Farland meant their sudden rages or other inexplicabilities to be gripping, when they're really just the opposite. Plus there are many times he simply botches character development or plot devices. This reader rolled his eyes too many times at _The Runelords_ to want to read the sequel. Poor grammar, poor plot structure, poor pacing. Farland's interesting notion of granting endowments by runes is far outweighed by this book's over-abundant flaws. One guesses that the author dusted off something he wrote in high school and sent it to Tor, who published it because it's lengthy."
2,"boring, preachy and pretentious","The author came up with some interesting ideas for a world system and how magic works and it's really the only thing that makes me pick up the book and keep trying to read it (that an the fact that I bought up several books in the series thinking I'd save time having them on hand). The characters are flat and one dementional keeping to stereotypes. I'm finally almost done with the first book. Save money and if you still feel the need to read the book, borrow it."
5,Outstanding,"The first book in the series (of four and then extended by four, it would seem) was one of the best pieces of fantasy I've read- a world as complete as those that Robert Jordan, MZ Bradley, Anne McCaffrey and David Coe built. It spent nearly 600 pages in four days of adventure where there was never a moment bereft of intrigue, excitement and wonder.The effusive praise of notables of F-SF like Terry Brooks, Orson Scott Card and Aldrys Budrys induce me to pick it up from the rack and I'm not looking back.This is what I'm reading until I've read them all (and yes, I will always have the next one waiting before I finish the one I'm in)."
3,Not good enough to make me buy Book 2,"This does have an original magical system, but wasn't compelling enough to make me read book 2. I also loaned it to a friend who felt the same way."
3,Some original ideas mixed with some cliches...,"Decent reading, but not in the realm of Martin or Tolkien. Good way to pass time while waiting for ""A Feast for Crows"". ;)Positives1> Original magical system (endowments)2> Reasonable plot and character development3> Solid writing style with good pacingNegatives1> Plot is derivitory - great evil threatens the planet, one hero emerges to save everyone, etc...2> While parts of this series are very original, Farland also seems to borrow from the work of others. Earthpower? Donaldson with Thomas Covenant. Worm of the World? Herbert with Dune (and Donaldson). Reavers? Sounds like Feists creatures in Magician.Overall, IMO it's worth a read."
4,Dark Fantasy,"One of the things I like most about this series from David Farland is that the cultures are not easily identified as having celtic or asian roots. In addition, the primary magic system is dark, and even the deities are more harsh than benevolent.This is such a refreshing change from other fantasy offerings that it is immediately arresting. Farland's characters are sometimes not as well developed as they might have been in this first book, but by the second in the series he hits his stride in this area as well.Plot is pretty standard, which is fine. After all, there has to be a hero, a quest, a battle against evil and sacrifice or it's not fantasty, right?What makes good fantasy in my opinion, is the characterisations, the plot variations, the magic and/or religious systems and the ability to transport the reader into a new world.Over the space of the two books I have now read, Farland scores in all categories."
3,Worth Reading,"Runelords is a book worth reading just for the discription of the magic system. I think that Mr. Farland could use some assistance fleshing out his characters a bit more. For one he has chosen the worst name, Gaborn, for the main character. I got so tired of reading the name that I would sub the ""prince"" or ""born"" or ... I could not believe it when I read that.The magic system is very interesting and has some wonderful possibilities. I look forward to reading more."
1,Badly Written,"I was excited to start reading this series after finding Terry Goodkind torture to read but after 100 pages I had to put this book down. I almost never stop reading until the book is done but I could not continue - the writing is sooooo bad. The story is unbelievable and as another reviewer stated the magic is more of a ""commodity"". No one tops Robert Jordon for me although I do find Brandon Sanderson to be excellent. Read the Wheel of Time or the Mistborn Series instead of this!"
2,This... book... is... so... slow....... Great for insomniacs,"It took 54 pages for the lead character to meet a girl in a marketplace, and he was already there! Something like 4 paragraphs to drink a glass of wine... We get a description of the bottle, the berries, where they come from, etc... Give me a break! I feel the writer has something to say, but he needs an editor.I enjoy fantasy, but it has to move along. Plodding epics by Jordan, Goodkind, and now Farland put me to sleep. If you agree, check out David Gemmell, Weis/Hickman, Raymond Feist, and similar authors, and leave this book alone."
1,"inelegant,derivative,and predictable.","This is an unfortunate excercise in epic fantasy that seems far to dependant on role playing games ( characters have amounts of strength,wit,glamour,etc. that make one think of D&D for example) to make it the least bit interesting. The charecters are flat-line dull and seem to have been created out of a handbook for fantasy genre writing. I made it through about half the book before deciding it just wasn't getting any better. If you want fantasy that has depth, complexity, passion, charecters that come alive, and - here's a concept- originality, try George R.R. Martin, C.J. Cherryh, Anne Bishop, or any one of a variety of truly imaginative scribes who make fantasy so vivid."
1,"""The Sum of All Men is Zero""","This overblown, overlong, over-praised fantasy is nothing short of amazing in its lack of logic. Even given ""endowments"", how, pray tell, does a horse run 80 miles an hour without ripping all its muscles to shreds? And if the rulers are getting extra endowments of ""wit"", why can't they manage to have boiling oil boiled in the right place at the right time -- just for starters? (The right place is not in the courtyard, then to be hauled up to the battlements, and the right time is not afternoon when you're expecting a night attack...of course it cooled!) If Raj Ahten has so much endowed ""wit"", why does he leave 40,000 irreplaceable magic branding irons in someone else's care? And why, oh WHY is the worst thing the author can think of to happen to a woman to lose her ""grace"" -- that is, her good looks? The ""endowment"" scenes, by the way, are almost pornographically embarrassing."
4,"Very enjoyable, despite some flaws.","It's not perfect (I had some problems with certain characters). But overall its a unique and, at many times, gripping story. I look forward to the next one in the series."
1,"So So book, but I would pass on it.","I read it due to all of the previous comments, but I have to admit I was really disappointed. It started out fine, but I was bored by the middle and count not even finish it. Maybe I'm ""too"" used to George R. R. Martin, Stephen Donaldson and Robert Jordan, who have well developed characters and plots. This book was just too light and shallow for my preference."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZ,"After exhausting my pile of Stephen R. Donaldson and Robert Jordan books, I decided I needed to begin another epic fantasy series to keep me occupied. I ran into Farland's book at the bookstore and decided to try it out.While I admire the ingenuity that Farland put into developing his world's magic, I tripped through the first 277 pages wincing each time I predicted the next string of events. Moreover, sets of unbelievable circumstances occur at just the right places (like when an assassin kills a messenger, who is found by the good guys, dead... and TAHDAH!! though the messenger was important enough to be assassinated by the bad guys, the assassin hadn't bothered to take the message, which gives the good guys a huge advantage.)The characterization is flat and dull. I was at no time convinced that I should really care about what happens to the lead characters. I struggled through the book, waiting for it to get better, but I finally set it down at page 277 and never picked it back up."
2,Really Pretty Mediocre,"Just another generic fantasy novel with a fancycover.Poorly-described characters, monsters, world. So the author hasa somewhat original magic system big deal, doesn't raise this book above the rest of the slop. Consider that a handful of reviewers that say it's the greatest book ever and they wept when they read it. Yeah right. This book is no better and no worse than the rest of the fantasy shelves that seem to cater to junior high students. This book stinks."
4,One of the best books I've read,"I bought this book through a book magazine because cover looked good so I thought what the hell, I'll give it a try. When I first began to read the book, I was disappointed as it was not up to my expectations. So, I stopped reading it after the first chapter and onto the shelf it went. However, later I took it up again and once I got past the first few chapters, I couldn't believe what an amazing book it was. I mentally kicked myself for not reading it sooner. The overall plot of the book is that this lord, Raj Aten, is intent on taking over all his neighbouring countries and it seems that the only individual who can stop him is a young prince named Gaborn. The most amazing concept of the whole story is the idea of endownments but I won't go into any more detail on that as it would probably ruin the story. So don't be fooled by the first few chapters; give it a go and you'll thank me!"
2,"Interesting, but poorly written","I was very excited to read this book based on the many glowing reviews that I have read. However, I found the book to be a poorly written, overly melodramatic piece of fluff. I found the magic system of ""endowments"" to be interesting, but ultimately underdeveloped, especially the obvious moral aspects involved. The writer's style was very annoying in that he continuously broke the cardinal rule of fiction writing: show, don't tell. I don't want to be told what such and such a character feels, I want to see it and experience it along with them. This style left the characters flat and lifeless. While the author made a few attempts at world-building, his efforts didn't amount to much more than namedropping. It's really too bad, because this could have been a major work of fantasy fiction, given one or two more re-writes and a decent editor. I'll pick up the sequel as a used softcover with the hopes that Mr. Farland can improve his style and make these characters live."
3,"It alright, but it doesn't match up to the most of the genre","Its good, its new and its fresh. This is a solid fantasy book. It has the tradtional good vs. bad king kind of battle. It seemed that all the peoples of his new and fresh world is modeled after one of our own world.Reasons to read thisYou like traditional fantasyYour looking for something newIt is fresh and originalNew sort of ""power"" called endowments, in which one person gains strength, beauty, speed, etc, by draining it from another person.Reasons not to read thisYou don't like fantasy.It does have some traditional touch, but it also is original, its your call here.The plot line needs revision, it's a bit of a handicap to the book."
3,Good read!,"Good read. Enjoyed it and the series. It wasn't as...involving...as other books are. But, it was great none-the-less."
5,Fascinating!,"Fantasy on a truly epic scale, with original plot and magic system. Farland is the new big name of the genre."
5,Completely and Truly Magical! Unbelievable!!,"I didn't know what to expect when I read the back of the book. But when I got into it, I was unable to set the book down. I was wound up in the exceptional web of fantasy that David Farland had woven. Now, waiting unpatienly for the 3rd book, I am unable to find any other book that matches the Runelords in its superb action and detail."
2,Repetitive....and not scary.,I played it alone...in the dark.....and practically fell asleep. Im sure I would have rated it better if I played it when it came out. But it's dated now.
3,A+ For Effort,"Awesome game. I've always wanted to play as a cop tracking down a serial killer. Very sweet premise, and the game is creepy as hell. I like the gritty realism, how you're not fighting demons or zombies, but homeless bums and drug addicts GONE WILD!The bad? Repetitive. After awhile you're just walking around beating s@#$ outta everyone.This game needed to start with a training course for detective work and the control scheme, and from there, turn you loose on crimes scenes on your own. Instead, they pretty much select the tools for you and lead you through the investigative process.5 stars for fun---3 overall for repetitiveness."
2,Sounds better than it is,"I bought this game after reading all the good reviews, but I cant see how it got rated so high. This game had potential if the story stayed about serial killer and didn't drift off so far. The enemy stays the same through out the game except for the end boss. Your weapon selection sucks which mostly leaves you fighting with a board & nail or lead pipe because ammo cannot be collected so guns run out fast and have to be discarded. Not as fun as I hoped and I would not recommend this game to anyone."
3,Great story but unfortunately average,"It's pretty much destiny that video games don't translate well to movies or television. Apparently the same is true in reverse. Condemned has a fantastic story. The voice acting is spot on. This would have made a great movie or television miniseries. Unfortunately, the gameplay kind of stinks. The only thing that kep me going was the engrossing story. The annoying fighting interface was sad. The ""investigative"" tools and situations felt forced and contrived. I get that the idea was to have a great story that you could interact in and drive as the main character. I just don't think they pulled it off very well. Apparently they are making a sequel. Let's hope it's an improvement."
2,Not So Fast!!!!!!!!!,"I read several of the reviews about this game and got suckered into shelling out sixty bucks for it. It is ten levels long -- six bucks a level. It takes only a day to beat it. The graphics are excellent, but game play is too slow and boring. They at least could have given us another serial killer to hunt down after you catch Serial Killer X to make another ten levels or so. But then again this game is so slow and boring it wouldn't hold your attention for twenty levels -- you'd be selling it on Amazon just like I'm going to do after I write this. This game just doesn't have much going for it other than being pretty."
1,worst game ever played.,very slow moving. boring as hell. graphics suck. i only played for 10 minutes and absolutely hated it. by far the stupidest game i've ever played. If you want a good horror game get resident evil 4. don't waste even a dollar on this game you will not be satisfied.
4,Scary as Hell!,"Condemned: Criminal Origins was one of the very best scary games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. The story line is compelling, the characters are ok, graphics are excellent for the release frame however they are starting to show their age, and the satisfaction of knocking a freakin' crackhead hobo around with a....well many, many blunt hard objects, is great. Totally recommend for survival horror/action gamers with a taste for the ultra-violent."
3,Condemed (game),The game was okay. I thought it would have been more fun. regardless it was not terrible and the achievements were very easy to get so I suppose that is a plus. Overall it was not terrible but was not at all my favorite either.
4,Disturbingly awesome,If you like resident evil or having your heart pound out of your chest this game is for you.
4,A tad bit on the scary side...,"Sometimes I still try to play this game in the day time, but I still get spooked! It is a solid game; gameplay is good, though the gadgets you use are sometimes a little out of place, graphics are good, sound is scary, and the action is intense! If you have surround sound, a man cave, and a whole lotta time... pick this game up.(Con: Not completely sure about the storyline still...)"
2,Urban Friction,"This movie is pretty bad. There is a plot, but perhaps too much of one, too much dialogue and not enough action. There are some good scenes, but I'd like some more eye candy."
2,NOT a good replacement for bubble tape,"i bought this cuz i thought it was gonna be a cheap replacement for bubble tape gum. it is the same kind of gum. but the contatiners and the actual size of the gum is NOWHERE near the same as bubble tape gum. i gave this 2 stars since its still gum and it tastes the same but it aint ""6 feet of gum"" in each roll. i know it doesnt advertise that for THIS gum but cmon i really thought it was the same. the things are really tiny. its stupid. u can go thru 1 container in like an hour probly."
4,"Two Visionaries, Different Eras","Peres takes Herzl on an imaginary tour through Israel, a century after Herzl's first visit to Palestine. The author makes astute observations about Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and the spectacular changes these and other cities in Israel have undergone throughout the years.Peres evaluates the predictions made by Herzl in his utopian novel, Old-New Land, in light of present-day realities. Of course, some of them were totally off-base, but others are amazingly prescient. And, in discussing the character of the Jewish state and how it ought to deal with its neighbors, Peres quotes extensively from Herzl's writings and the works of other Zionist thinkers (e.g., Ahad Ha'am).Despite the mediocre editing job, there is plenty of keen insight on issues ranging from cultural/religious/ethnic diversity to the water problem in the Middle East that make this book a good read."
3,Comparing visions,"Shimon Peres, Nobel Peace Prize winner and a former prime minister of Israel, finds a way to examine how far Israel has come in a half-century by conducting an imaginary tour of the Holy Land for Theodor Herzl, father of Zionism. While the prose is hardly exotic, Peres does offer some keen and thought-provoking analysis. The book is recommended for readers with an interest in modern Israel."
4,Do YOU every get Frightened?,Cressida Cowell has written a very caring story to show that even adults get frightened and that is ok. It appears to be a wonderful story to share with children when they are frightened about something new in their lives. Well worth reading.
4,A whopping great bag!,"This is a great bag. Bigger than I'd thought it would be, with pockets everywhere. I'd give it 5 stars, but my only gripe is that I wish that it was easier to access the big middle storage area. I always have to move the handle aside to move my items in & out. (Which isn't really that much of a bother....)"
4,Rare find,"I found this book once in a library of the town I used to go to college in. Though it has no real organization, it has tons of historical references and stories dealing with the actual history and writings of alchemy.I would love to have my own copy of this book and would recommend it to anyone who wants an accurate view of the history of alchemy. It covers practically every major figure in alchemy and then some with actual translations of some of their works and comments about them by their peers."
5,My favorite book,"Ok...one of my favorite books. Other reviews I read made me think this book would be very philosophical and dense, possibly even pretentious. In reality, the book is existentialist philosophy intertwined with Stephen King. Its a great book. Ive never read anything remotely close to it...one of a kind!"
3,Too little background on whole family,"This was an interesting enough book, but would have like to have learned more about the family dynamics that were alluded to in the later part of the book. For example, her father, not talking to him, the other siblings that were briefly mentioned, etc. The horror of schizophrenia was very descriptive. That part of the book that was woven throughout made the book readable. I can't imagine having a child who would have to endure this type of mental illness."
4,Good,"I read it in one day, and it was good. It was a more unique account of how schizophrenia affects both the family and the individual, especially since they are twins. Not the most spectacular thing in the world, but worth reading, for those who are interested in schizophrenia and its effect on the family."
4,Not bad.,"Amazing book. It teaches you a lot while holding your attention like a novel.The seller I bought it from was timely, though the book was in worse condition than expected. Oh well. The book was worth it."
2,Strange but true,This is a book told by twin sisters. One with schizophreniaand other problems. The sick twin is brilliant and the normal twin is treated as inferior until the genius twin gets sick.A wildly dysfunctional family.A more complex account of what schizophrenia can do to siblingsis Clea Simon's MAD HOUSE. Both her siblings had schizophreniaand Clea grew up to become a successful writer.
1,Boring,This book is not worth reading. The writing is tortuous and the book is no more that an attempt to capitalize on the twins' story - one has schizophrenia and one doesn't. It is not insightful -- it's not even interesting.
3,3 Stars,"Overall, this book was okay. The only real problem I had with it was Carolyn's writing, it was bad. How bad was it? Well, the other day my cat walked across my keyboard and what appeared on the screen was better then what she wrote."
5,No Sequel,Unfortunately Elyse has moved publishers and will probably not making the sequel. It is ashame as it was a great book.
4,Best PSP game period,"I'm not a big videogame player, and usually get bored of games quickly, but I've had this game now for 9 months, and even though I have 4 other games for my PSP, this is the one I still love--it never gets boring, and even though in general I am really bad at all videogames, I have slowly improved, though I'm still not through half the levels and need to find some cheats. The gameplay is great, though they could have a few more weapons (maybe there are at higher levels). I managed to download one new track and ship thru the wireless connection but haven't tried again now for a while. Anyway, it's a great game overall."
2,For kids or Not?,"It almost pains me to write this review as I am sure people will hate my review as much as I hated this game. The Good: absolutely beautiful game. Good animations, great worlds. This game is great for people who will take the hours necessary to master the racing in this game. This game could last forever for them. The Bad: However, for those of us with lives that like to game from time to time for some fun times, avoid this game at all costs. It is flipping hard. Without hours of practice, you will slam into 3-4 walls of every race, thus insuring your defeat and frustration.Bottom Line: Is it fun? If you have lots of time to master it. I am told you will love the game once you do. Will I keep it? I am also told you have no life if you spend it all mastering the fine art of a VIDEO GAME. Is it for kids? Nope. Too hard."
4,Speed racing,"Quickly, this is a great game for on the go gaming. Also, it shows off the PSP's awesome graphics power. It even has weapons?!? It can get boring at times though, no biggie. So for $40.00, you cant really go wrong with this game unless you hate racing."
2,No Fun,"This game is no fun because of everything in it!The races are boring, the music is weird, and you do the same thing in every race...No creativity in it. I recommend you get a different racing game like Need for Speed(any of them are good) or Burnout(any of them also). Those are some excellent racing games. ;)"
4,my review,this was my first psp game. it is really fun but i wish it had a battle type mode and that it was a little easier. it also has a glitch that lets you surf the web!it shows off the psps cpabilitys too. i reccomend this as a first psp game to anybody.
4,Pretty much a racing game,"Very nice graphics. Vehicle is hard to control, and my thumbs gettired from constantly pushing on the analog nub and the X button.Soundtrack is so-so, pretty generic techno stuff. Supposedly there'sa way to hack the built-in web browser so it can be used forgoing to sites other than the download page. I'm not quite surewhy there are so many 5-star reviews for this game. It's OK, butnothing special."
3,Not what I was expecting...,"I'm sure most of us here had the original version for the PS1. 'Pure' lacks many things including actual control of your ship.I've had the game for less than a week and maybe 3 playing hours and I already want to take it back. The only thing that seems to make the control better is to keep it in first-person view.Don't run away yet and start dogging me on this. To me, it's just not living up to it's hype as ""a must have""."
5,WOW,"WOW! This game is wild. After a race my heart is pounding. Because of the PSP's incredible graphics, I reallyfeel like I'm in the game.If you want a free PSP copy this link http://www.FreePSPs.com/?r=17213341there are no strings attached you actually get free stuff, I have before"
1,ripoff pure,nothing new here sony keeps redoing DATED old gamesthe action stops every time u hit the wallpower up icons dont make sense. a wavy line and a dot for speedup eh?the music suks thats the only plus for these gamesneed for speed is way better
3,its really fun,"i recommend this game because it has a lot of variety of cars and tracks. the wifi can get you internet and the latest downloads. its fun and never gets old but one thing is when there is a really hard racing track and you just cant beat it, it makes you frustrated you know what i mean? sometimes i play a track for an hour before i beat it. and also i dont know if something is wrong but i heard reports that their games keep freezing( it happened to mine too) so you can get it if you like i mean its really fun and some other games i recommend are twisted metal head on and nba street showdown over all its ok and worth it"
4,"Good Book, but Out of Date","I wish Elliott Massie had updated this book since writing it in 1995. It is a useful book, but there have been many improvements in technology and I would have liked to have seen his opinion about what works and what does not work in an online setting.Even for an experienced trainer, this book contained some helpful suggestions."
5,Disturbing Picture of the Destruction of a Country From Within,Seattle Summer Film and Video Festival - Best DocumentaryMade by probably the most awarded and prolific Balkan documentary film maker. Razor sharp examination of a complex tragedy.
4,Sound Poker stragegy laced with colorful life adventures.,"Expecting a dry litany of statistics on the variousgames of poker, I was pleasantly surpirsed at thecolorful pictures Yardley painted with the semiautobiographical story of his 'Education of a PokerPlayer'. The book starts with a shadey near-turnof the century poker room frequented by his youth.Much of the time the book focuses on this relationshipwith mentor and friend Monty. The book pleasantlyshifts from pure strategy, to the philosophy and art of Poker,to the stories of Yardleys middle aged adventures as acode decriptor in China approaching the second WorldWar. The only dissapointment in the book was the abruptending, no wrap up. While the story left you wonderingwhat happened with the rest of his life, your knowledgeof how to play and win all popular forms of the game Pokerwill be very much closer to complete"
5,A fantastic book that addresses the textural aspects of the game.,"Poker books of late, for the most part, have all been about strategy. If you're already figured out how to play small pairs in early position or if you're looking for a poker book that isn't about ""odds"", this one is about as good as you're going to get.I don't know if all the stories are to-the-letter true or not- Yardley may have exaggerated some of them a wee bit- and it was definitely written in a different time but overall, the organic advice about the gamesmanship aspects of poker is spot-on accurate (from my perspective as a winning NLHE and mixed games player). There is just so much more that goes in to beating this game than pot odds and hand selection.I don't think this book will appeal strictly left-brained sort of people who view the game of poker almost entirely as a mathematical exercise, but it will appeal to everyone else."
4,good purchase,nice welder smooth wire speed not very good welds with the flux core wire. can't wait to try it with the gas I hope it's better . other than that it's a good welder for light work
4,recon wirewelder,"I've bought several factory reconditioned tools through Amazon com.I've always been satisified.This was no exception.Great price,works well.The back cover was dented but that was it."
1,Voodo Remanufacturing,"Took welder out of box and in doing so the lifting handle broke off its moorings. Oh well, don't really need that part, do I. Went to load wire and the retaining clamp came off. It had a broken base which must somehow have slipped by as the repairer was nodding off. So, a trip to the distant repair facility and a long wait for a fix or replacement and then a trip back to pick it up. Buyer beware and save all your paperwork your going to need it."
1,"Arms & Armor, need the stuff, but not this book","In a normal fantasy setting, you realy can not do without decent armor and weapons, however there is many sources where you could find information on that part.I will not spend my money on this (poor) quality art and only reasonable information. The only part of the book that could potentaly draw your attention is about new materials for armor and arms.Still even that information can be found in other books as well..."
2,not what I thought,the product itself was fine and very well made; I just didn't realize I was buying a sleep shirt and so returned it.
1,What Is It?,"If you would only tell us what music is on this CD I would be happy to review it. The album cover calls it ""Les cloches"" -- French for ""The Bells,"" but since this is a relatively short composition I am sure there must be other Rachmaninoff music on the album. If you shold decide to share this information with the reader I would be happy THEN to review the album."
3,SUMMER READING,EACH BOOK IS ENTERTAINING. I STARTED WITH THE DEATH OF RILEY AND WAS A BIT IRKED BY ITS INITIAL CUTENESS BUT IT WAS FUN TO HEAR THE TALES OF OLD NEW YORK. IN DUBLIN S FAIR CITY THE FUN STARTED WITH THE OCEAN VOYAGE AND WAS IMAGINATIVE IN ITS TELLING. GREAT WHEN YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO EMPATHIZE WITH DEPRESSED PEOPLE.
3,Weakest of the series,This book was the weakest of the series. It did not go in depth enough about the relationship between Molly and her brothers. Let's hope the next book is stronger.
2,I'm Confused,"I like the Molly Murphy series, however, this latest book was confusing to me. I don't understand why the person revealed as Rose's murderer would have killed her even if it was a case of mistaken identity and the victim should have been Molly. Why would this person (I don't want to name names) have killed Molly when he was following her so she would lead him to Tommy Burke's sister. Doesn't make any sense and ruined the whole book for me. Also, I thought the book ended abruptly and would have liked to know what was going to happen to Malachy."
3,Poor Quality Kindle Edition,"I enjoyed the continuing story of Molly Murphy, although this one is a bit too far fetched, but this book has not been carefully transferred to the Kindle. The dropped letters, occasionally strangely sized text, incorrectly hyphenated words, and run together words are distracting. I expect the Kindle editions to be better than this."
