1,Die F**king MTV A**h**e Nu Metal Pr**ks,"This disc is a complete waste of $20.00. This disc is one of the lamest attempts Metallica ever put out. One, the title track is slow and f**king boring. Now you know how much it sucks, so trash every copy you can find.Thrash is F**king Dead. Metallica's next."
1,poopy unless ya get it for fifty cents like i did,"this is a mega-ton poopy cd. metallica will never be like the master of puppet or black album days. personally i think metallica should stop making music before they make another poopy cd. long live the old days of metallica, but the new days of metallica should be flushed down the crapper. the only reason i listen to it is cause when ya win it out of an arcade game, its all good LOL unless its a crappy jewel cd LOL."
4,Will REAL Metallica Fans Please Stand Up?,"I just don't get it.All you hardcore speed/thrash metal freaks that get all worked up and hot and bothered over ""Master Of Puppets""(which was a great album) and hated the guts outta ""Load"" (which was a great album in its own right) are completely hypocritical. You pressured Metallica over and over again telling them they went alternative and sold out, so they succumbed to your ""needs"" and released the natiest Metallica alblum ever, and what do you do? Berate the bejesus out of it. This is a really a great album if you get past having no solos (cry me a river!) Dirty Window, St. Anger, Frantic, are all great tunes. So its poorly produced, yeah!, and so was ...And Justice and that was a killer album. You ""fans"" and I do use that word lightly, need to open up your ears to the most lyrically poignant album from Metallica in awhile. Just Listen and DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!"
1,Master Of Puppets,"End of passion play, crumbling awayI'm your source of self-destructionVeins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clearLeading on your deaths constructionI think someone was pulling James strings, I was totally disappointed listening to the new album. I thought you guys sold out with ""Reload"", but this new album was so bad I made up an excuse to take it back.Where were the guitar solo Kirk, and the true music that made you guys big during the ""Captain Crunch"" days? There was no heart, passion, or meaning behind the lyrics but garbage put out on a record to make money. Sad but true I think it over for Metallica. Don't waste your money on this album cause if you look closely to the tombstones on the ""Master Of Puppets"" CD you will see their names. RIP Metallica"
1,Metallica should have quit while they were ahead!,"This is perhaps the worst CD I have ever heard (and I just had to listen to the Kelly Clarkston CD!). It doesn't even deserve the one star that I gave it! This sounds nothing like Metallica. The lyrics are terrible, Lars cannot play drums worth a flip, and there are no guitar solos! This is a pathetic piece of what Elektra records calls music. Do not buy this! It is a HUGE waste of money! I have never been more disappointed in a band. (....)"
1,Terrible...,"This is just an awful album. If you put a set of trashcans on a stage, tied a cat to a rope hanging from a ceiling fan set to high, you might come near the sounds emanating from this Bob Rock standard production. It's a shame that Robert Trujillo of Suicidal Tendencies got mixed up with these has-beens, because he's the only talented member of the bunch."
2,A poor effort,What happened? Fame happened. Some of the riffs in this are real good but then..wham another riff that does not go well with the previous. I do not want to hear James singing about his rehab experience..who cares.Sound way too much like Nine Inch Nails. This band is regressing from the early efforts of Kill Em All and Ride the Lightning.
1,a dispicable compliation of [garbage],"This is by far the worst album that has ever been produced. It is a shame that I can not give it less than one star. Garage bands display more musical prowess and better lyrics have appeared on Sesame Street. No guitar solos, as I am sure you know. Whiney, self-pittying lyrics like the rest of the garbage on the radio (""Invisible Kid"" stands out here). You have been warned! Lars is currently disgruntled that our government uses Metallica's as well as other metal bands music to intimidate terrorists between interogations. Someone call the ACLU! It would be more humane to subject them to anthrax (not the band). It is a shame to say that Metallica is officially dead. I guess we'll have to look to the dim-witted likes of Staind and Godsmack as the new hard rock harbingers. This album, however, makes a terrific coffee coaster."
2,No idea where they're going or what they want to do,"I've been a fan since the '80s, and this album is a ship without a sail. Hetfield and crew obviously have no idea what they want to be anymore- the heavy, pounding band of the '80s-early '90s or the band every high school cheerleader loved in the late '90s. The music says the former, the lyrics and overall attitude indicate the latter.This thing is heavy and angry, but it's that way just for the sake of being heavy and angry. This is nothing like what they've done before, and, although their last few albums made good coasters but not much more, that isn't necessarily a good thing."
4,IM ANGRY FOR ST. ANGER,"If your looking for Re-Re-Load, you've got the wrong cd. If your looking for the slightly blacker album, you've come to the wrong place. Even if you want ...And More Justice For All, you just wont be getting it. St. Anger is one of the rawest unpolished pieces of metal (no pun intended) out there today. It is definately not meant for one listen. It grows on you about the third time through. The highlights are Frantic, Dirty Window, Shoot Me Again, All Within My Hands, and Invisible Kid. There are no solos on this album, Lars's drumming is super loud and sometimes over powers the guitars, Bob Rock's style of bass (he played bass on the album) is not the traditional Metallica kind, and Hetfield's voice is an unpolished growl. But, the album is very heavy, probably one of Metallica's heaviest. So if you expect something different, get St. Anger. If you want more of the same, dont get St. Anger"
1,Unbelievable!!!!,"When I say unbelievable, I mean it in a negative sense. I am absolutely shocked at just how bad this album is. This is truly the end of the very band that got me into Metal. I dealt with the changes on the last two albums, but this is far too much. This album screams of Nu-Metal and kills the integrity of the band. Track after track I hoped for something to stand out, it never happened. Kirk is non-existant on this album, the vocals suck, and the riffs are boring and repetitive. Lars is the only one who stepped it up on this album, flying on the double bass here and there. I give this album 0 stars!!"
1,Save Your Money,"I have been a fan of Metallica since I bought Kill Em All on LP when it first came out in 1983. I have lived through the Load, Reload and S&M days with patience hoping there would be a return to the Metallica of old. Not a Master of Puppets 2, but a Metallica cd worthy of their abilities. This is my payoff? This cd is garbage. Fragmented songs built on a foundation of faux angst. Don't waste your time and money. Opeth, Cradle of Filth, Superjoint Ritual are a few bands that rock like Metallica used to."
2,To much Rock,"Bob Rock that is. I think at this point in time, they need to kick Bob to the curb and find a producer that isn't so invloved and close with the band. THe new Bass player DOESN'T EVEN PLAY on the CD, Bob Rock did all Bass playing on this album, plus he produced, recorded, and mixed it. Because of this, the album is almost impossible to listen to. You ALWAYS need smoebody's perspective ad opion that isn't with the band, and at this point, Bob isn't it. I'm glad I can't hear the bass guitar most of the time, the playing is horrible. The drums are even worse. I've tried to listen to this CD on many occasions, and I can't get past the snare drum. It is the loudest instrument on the whole CD and starts to give me a headache after a while. The music/song writing is actually pretty good, but it is almost impossible to listen to. I've always thought that Metallica should hire Producer extraordinaire Andy Wallace. He is needed now more than ever."
4,Great album.....but it has to grow on you,"This is the album that definitely needs growing space. The first time I heard it I was thinking ""What and awful racket"" but it really really grows on you. Worth hearing many times are the title song, Frantic, Unnamed feeling. Also make sure you catch the movie. It will put metallica in a whole different light for you. They have definitely earned back my respect"
1,Junk,"Yes, I'm a Metallica hater, since the day they said they simply don't care about anything eles more than their own inflated egoes. Just that. Since the day Lar$ went against Napster; since the day they fired Newsted and all the truth about their cruel behaving against their bass player came out; since when they hired pop metal producer Bob Rock; since the stupid S&M; since Load & Reload; and, finally, since St. Anger, the ""Ugliest"" metal album ever.They scored a point here: altough the album is clearly trying to copy numetal, it's not a commercial album at all, because it's simply impossible to listen to this kind of disjointed, bad-tasted, ludicrous ""music"".Some people say the DVD sound is better. That's true. But is impossible to swallow Lars and his hideous face, to stand Trujillo ridiculous movements, see that Bob Rock is around, and check that Hetfield's vocals are gone for sure.This band is fake, they committed the greatest sell out of the music industry ever.Well, St. Anger is junk."
1,This CD will make a nice coaster,"After repeated listens to this album, I try to think as how anyone could give this a positive review.. I won't even go into the garbage can sounding snares or lack of solos.. What truly concerns me as longtime Metallica fan (since '88) is their departure from what made them great.. I accepted Load after a while, but St.Anger makes Load sound like Master of Puppets.. The lyrics are immature, the vocals are horrid (James is tryimg to sing?? why??), and just the lack of emotion.. I know we can't live in the past and this is the new Metallica and I have accepted that, but what I can't accept is corporate america and 15 year old fans praising this album when we all know Metallica is in the twilight of their career, and the desire they once had is dead and gone.. Jason left at the right time and he is the only one w/ a shred of dignity remaining"
3,suffers from lack of...,"oh metallica, what have you done to yourselves, and why would you put your name on this?First off, this is not a bad album, just not a good one eather, but when compared to the rest of metallica it is flat out horrible.Second, the production is horrible!!!!!!!!Third, James what happened to your voice, was rehab that bad?Fourth, Yea Robert Trujillo, tho he didnt play bass on the album, Rob Rock (the producer) did, ikkThis albums suffers majorly from the lack of Kirk's solos.Tho St. anger has some good songs, the overall album deserves to be sent to the discount bin...faster than you can say, I'm madly in anger with you."
1,Justice is Lost,"Metallica has gone down hill ever since And Justice for all. They should have let that be their last album and end with excellence. The Blak album though was tolerable, Load was lame, Reload, Please, and finally St. Anger is Pitiful. I would not even waste the time downloading the Mp3's. James must have really burnt his brains out from drinking. And Bob Rock on the bass Ha ha ha ha ha. James Hetfield should have never tried to sing. His old vocal style of harshness and not all drawn out was what made him sound good. I miss Kirk's signature sounding guitar solo's that you don't even here anymore. Metallica should have gone back to Flemming Rasmussen for help."
2,Very disappointing,"As a hard core Metallica fan, I was very disappointed with the direction the band took. This was the album where they were supposed to return to their roots, not go of into an entirely new style. I will just have to keep on listening to Ride the Lightning some more, because this album isn't worth the money I spent on it."
2,Metallica has lost it,"Let me tell you, myself and other Metallica fans alike waited close to six years for this CD to come out. What a disappointment. After such albums as Load and ReLoad, when I read that Metallica was returning to how their old sound was I was inspired to get this CD. Well it turns out they did get a new sound, and it is horrible. They are just another band now to catch on to the new metal trend. There is not one guitar solo, and the drumming is good but the damn snare drum sounds like a garbage can. This CD is terrible. For a real metal comeback, pick up Iron Maiden's Brave New World or Dance Of Death."
1,A big disappointment,No no no...what's this?? Is this really the kings of thrash metal??...I have a hard time understanding that!! I have worshiped Metallica ever since they released Master of Puppets and with this new CD... must say that they aren't the same band who used to kick some serious [butt] in the metal-scene!! There's to much industrial and modern punkfeel to it...If you thought Metallica went back to their old sound...i don't think you've spend your money right...I'm sorry to say but the kings of heavy/thrash metal is slowly fading away...=(
1,THEIR WORST ALBUM EVER!!!,In my opinion metallica has not produced anything good since the black album.Each album that comes out keeps getting worse and worse.The production sounds very bad and the songs sound very pop.The lyrics are very cheesy and the drums sound the worst.Even the cover art is boring and lame.This band has soldout and they sound more like an mtv nu metal band.Since experiencing commercial success they have gotten lazy and feel that they could put anything out and fans will still buy it.They need to retire if all the rest of their upcoming albums sound like this.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
1,"awful,disgraceful,terrible!","i got this cd the very 1st day of it's release & i've thrown it away already,it's that bad.Imagine 8 min long songs with no kirk's solos.lars's drumming seems as if he's hitting on empty cans.this terrible drumming i've only heard in sepultura's morbid vision.Only ""st.anger""is a good song.rest all songs are awful.rob's bass is not heared clearly anywhere.sure,cliff burton would be crying in his grave.this album's neither speed metal,nor thrash-it's pure trash & alternative.ok,folks-it's time metallica fade to black"
1,metalhead,"Really, what is this pile of crap. Never thought metallica would put out such a terrible release like st. anger as well as death mgnetic, was really excited when the band released death magnetic when i listened to it i was very dissapointed when i heard it, what another st. anger release. metallica was better known for their 80's."
5,St.Anger is an Explode Through the Roof,"St.Anger's core is made of pure explosive energy and easily is one of their best albums. It's different from the rest, but it's still has 100% Metallica Soul and devotion. With that said, anyone who trashes this album is most likely people that are conservative and probably trying to relive the 80's and early 90's. This album should not be compared with past master pieces like Ride the lighting or Master of Puppets because each have a different energy flow and St .Anger is no exception. I recommend to people to buy this album with an open mind and be ready to handle instance energy."
1,Worst Metallica CD ever.,"Let me get this straight: I loved all of Metallica's older CDs. I even loved Load and ReLoad a lot more than some of the 80's releases, but this CD is the worst I've ever heard from Metallica. It sounds like they're trying way too hard to impress some fanbase that is thirty to forty years old now. Either that or they're trying to grip onto the new generation with being incredibly angry. We must be angry because we made an album called St. Anger.You're trying way too hard, Metallica. Write music for yourselves, not for the fans. Please. It was better that way."
1,The final nail in the coffin for Metallica,"St. Anger is easily the biggest disappointment of 2003. I laugh at the people who actually think this album is good, most of them are just in denial and can't deal with how bad it is. I know that Metallica tries to do their own thing and not care what anyone thinks of them. However, they should've cared what the fans thought and gave them what they wanted. Instead, they try to ressurrect their old sound in the wrong way and fail miserably. The production is awful, Lars sounds like he's clanging on metal. The vocals are done in one take, so Hetfield sounds like a sick crocodile. The worst transgression though, is that there are NO GUITAR SOLOS. Metallica just isn't Metallica without solos. Metallica had already started to die when they created Load. Now they are officialy dead and old news."
1,Keep on searching,"It's like their first song on the album says, ""Keep on Searching,"" because this is not MetallicA. They've tuned into Brittney Spears too much and wish to sound like her. I prefer to listen to another band that sounds like the old MetallicA, Grave Digger. They just had a new album released and it kicks St. Anger. Check it out if you love true MetallicA."
1,No stars for this waste of polycarbonate.,"If I could give this a ""zero stars"" rating I would. Metallica has put out an album that most garage bands would be ashamed of. The sound is absolute crap (is Lars playing a garbage can or a snare?), the lyrics are something a 5th grader could pen, and as for the ""edgy, raw emotion"" that many reviewers discuss, that's simply a euphemism for ""didn't put any effort into the production or recording"". James Hetfield has followed the pantheon of musicians who have dried out not just from alcohol, but creatively, after rehab. If you're thinking you're going to hear good music, skillful guitar work (not a single solo on this record) and insightful lyrics, then you will be sorely disappointed. I think they wanted to release an album that no one would WANT to download to get back at Napster fans."
1,Sounds like it was recorded in a tin garage,"Sometimes I need to listen to an album 2 or 3 times before it grows on me. After listening to St. Anger for the second time, i'm ready to officially make it a coaster for my beer. the whole album sounds like it was recorded in a tin garage. It sounds as if kirk and james lost the bass knob on their amps and replaced them with extra treble ones. the drums sound like lars was banging on some cheap pots from IKEA. I saw them live on the summer sanitarium tour and they did two songs off this album and they performed them better live, but i was still not won over. The speed of old metallica from kill em all through and justice for all is present in this album, but the driving songs that make you want to headbang just are not there. they are very choppy, thrown together songs and this album will go down as the godfather part 3 of the metallica era."
1,"Garbage, Inc.","I've been listening to Metallica since the Puppets album came out in '86 and when the black album came out in '91 that was the last straw for me. I haven't bought a Metallica album since And Justice For All. Yeah I fell for the hype that the radio stations were giving about this album, but good thing I never bought this piece of [junk]. I came on here and listened to the samples and they sound like a bunch of 12 year olds in a garage band....sorry guys, it's time to turn those amps off."
1,this cannot be real,"Imagine my dismay upon hearing for the first time this utter dross that is the new Metallica cd. I, like many am a long time fan, i hated Load when it appeared but after many spins it got to me eventually, as did Reload.This new garbage however will never cut it. Yes the drums suck and the guitars are awful and James never sounded this bad before, and no it is not a return to early roots, to say that is displaying total ignorance, this sounds like a bad cover band playing in a garage with a duff sound system.Early Metallica never sounded like that, to compare this thing to the cds that gave Bellz, Fade to Black, Seek, Horsemen and Creeping Death is nothing short of ridicolous.I only hope that this is a passing phase and the next cd shows the undoubted ability within the band."
1,Not the Metallica of Yesteryear,"Metallica has just had a total miss with this one. The songs aren't structured like anything you can bang your head with, or sing along with. Lars has his snare drum tuned so loose that it will just aggravate you because you can hear it through the lyrics, and the lyrics don't make sense or tell a story like the old metallica stuff used to. St. Anger was the biggest disappointment I have had from a rock band in years."
4,Raw and Unrelenting,"...is about the only 2 words I could think of when i was listening. This isnt old Metallica, and its not new Metallica, its the NEW NEW Metallica...and its a very refreshing new sound. One thing youll notice off the bat is the drums... if you havent heard any Metallica song made before 1990, then youll think Lars [was excited] when you hear how hard n fast he goes. This is a fast, heavy , raw album. They dont even take the time to slow it down with a metal ballad. They wiped the slate clean when it came to what theyve done in the 90s... no mid-tempo head banging repetetive riffs... just high octane metal jams...most songs have that feeling of when you heard ""Fuel"" for the first time.. only they press it on a little harder this time... defineatly not what i expected, but i still had to say wow..its definately fresh... I cant promise youll like it.. but if you want something a lot faster n heavier than any of there material since 1990..."
2,This is Metallica?!,"This was a really disappointing CD to listen to. In anticipation of this CD, I had been listening to their older stuff. Perhaps that's what did it for me. I honestly have no idea what Metallica was doing with this CD. No guitar solos? Bland lyrics? Horrible sound quality? Snare drums?! Metallica is trying to go for a hardcore rock thing, but instead they sound like a really bad garage rock band.All in all, St. Anger seems really predated for Metallica. For another rock band this CD would be mediocre at best, but this is Metallica we're talking about here. If you want Metallica, pass on this and get S&M; and their self-titled albums."
4,Back To Basics...My Life Style Determines My Death Style,"So far, the reviews on the net have been that this release is too heavy. You heard me, too heavy!!!! It's obvious that the people who are saying that became fans of Metallica after And Justice For All. And even though I do like the CD's Metallica, Load, REload & Garage INC, they are too mainstream, and that is what listeners have gotten used to. This CD could have easily gone between Master Of Puppets & Justice. The first 2 songs grow on you very quickly, and the rest of the CD doesn't slow down from there. Every song is heavy, there is not a slow song on this one. This is the fast & heavy version of Metallica all the die hard fans have been missing for the past decade. If you're a fan of the old style Metallica, add this one to your collection. Trust me, you won't be disappointed."
2,Metallica - St Anger,"This album has it's moments but, overall it is not Metallicas best work. The lack of guitar solos from Kirk Hammet is disturbing to say the least. And the sound of the drums does not do Lars Urlrich's playing justice. Fans of Godsmack and Disturbed may enjoy this album but, The long time Metallica fans from the '80's will be un-impressed."
1,this blows horseballs,"A Metallica album without a guitar solo is like a hooker without a cooter... it just doesn't work very well. Unfortunately, this is the least of Metallica's problems on this album. Hetfield simply can't sing very well anymore, and they've all but forgotten how to put a song together. Yeah, the albums heavier than the last few, but the heavy parts seem heavy just to prove that they're heavy. I was hoping for something good from these guys, but they've dissapointed me. I feel sorry for Trujillo... he's entered the Metallica club at the wrong time.If you guys want an awesome Metal album, buy the new Anthrax... it's everything that this CD tries to be and more."
2,kind of metallicas worst,metallica is a good band but if you want a good cd from metallica then dont get this!
2,They tried....but failed,"This was maybe the most hyped cd of the year when it came out. Iw as personally excited about the return of Metallica. But this CD was just a big letdown. They have a new bassist, and they are all older. It just doesnt seem the same. James hetfileds vocals just arent good anymore, and Lars is just repeatedly hitting the same drum, its kinda annoying. The only good song here is St.Anger."
1,Metallica Releases its worst album ever,"The new Metallica CD, St. Anger, is a piece of garbage. That is the nicest thing I can say about this album. The album is poorly produced by Bob (doesn't)Rock. It sounds like it was not edited and was spliced together in five minutes.Every song sounds pretty much the same, with lame lyrics that pale in comparison with the band's previous albums, most notably Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets. The worst offender is Shoot Me Again, in which lead singer James Hetfield repeatedly screams ""Shoot me again, I ain't dead yet!"" Intelligent.Lars Ulrich changed the sound of his drums, and it now sounds like he is banging on pots and pans. Kirk Hammett is non-existent on the album, as it lacks guitar solos on any of the 11 songs.To sum it up, St. Anger is a sorry album that feels rushed. It seems that Metallica is trying too hard to return to their early sound. They should accept their evolving sound and move on, because they failed."
1,"i agree with everyone else, this is the worst metallica cd","I have tried to listen to this over and over again, I atleast tried to like it but I can't. I got a good deal ...dvd and st.anger t-shirt. Ok, the t-shirt was cool and worth [the money] but this cd is worthless. What the hell is Lars banging on, either he is banging on garbage cans or the worst drumset ever made. Hey BOB ROCK,YOU lost your producing abilities and keep working on that and stop playing the bass like you did on this cd,you [stink] and now you [stink] producing. Kirk and james did play some guitar well but that's all i can say. you must do this cd over again with a good set of drums from the BLACK ALBUM and some hard screaming from james's vox and get the new bass player to play bass from sucidal tend. not BOB ROCK."
2,No Damn Solos or enough trademark cool riffs!,"Firstly go and buy the latest ""Godsmack"" album - Faceless. Then you will see what sort of album metallica should have made - by the way - the godmack singer sounds just like the James of old.Being a huge Metallica fan at least Garage Inc was a great album, Load and reload had some damn good songs too, although some were a bit to be desired.I just hope Metallica can stand the test of time and come up with a better finale to their career or is this it? By the way i think the drumming has no proper fill ins either, where is the double kick bass (at least slipknot deliver) perhaps Metallica needed another drummer, maybe 2 would have helped! Very uninspirational Bass due to the fact there is only a little bit there and not enough to satisfy. Also no damn solos - I would have been happy with one or two really cool ones - at least godsmack has a couple of good ones even though there aren't many.Adios from a big Metallica fan of old"
1,They should have quite a long time ago...,Metallica's lost their touch. They've had a few member changes and well...they've gotten old. They're past the prime of their lives. I only listened to the single and it sounded like they cut back the guitar and let Lars have too much fun with the drums. Then there's that bit where it kinda' sounds like a bad attempt at rap. Can't explain that bit but you should know what I'm talking about.Metallica should have quit after Garage Ink.I think when 250-something people give it a 1 star (when over half of them would have given less if they could) should be a hint to GIVE IT UP.
3,"wrong direction, AGAIN!","Simply, St. Anger is too boring (every song sounds the exactly the same), too noisy (not loud, it's just painfully noisy), and waaaaay too long (75 minutes feel like all day long, I was like when they're gonna stop?) old school fans, newbies, it doesn't matter what kind of tallica fan you are. all of you will be dissapointed.p.s) there is no guitar solo at all. god bless kirk."
4,Don't Hate,"I don't understand why everyone bashes this album. It may be a whole lot different then what you'd expect, but if you think about it, this is a solid album. The riffs rock, the drumming, though slightly annoying at times, brings the great rhythm we all know and love, and the vocals are totally new and improved. Stop whining about production quality and listen to the music you pricks."
3,"Ok, whats happend here?","i cant think of much to say about this album really, it doesn't do a lot for me but neither is it bad. It is a heavy riffing crunching album, but there are two problems, and they are the lyrics and the drums. Metallica have always been reflective and interesting with their lyrical content, but st angers attempts strike me as what some 15 year old would write if starting out in a band. The second is those damn drums (I know im right, everyone else says the same) It sounds like a tin can full of pellets being shook! Away from the downside the album actually redeems itself with some bone crunching heavy riffs, listen to some kind of monster and invisible kid. What i found very strange was the fact that metallica had released two of the weakest tracks! St anger is awful and frantic no better. I wouldn't recommend buying it if your a new comer, because this would be no fair reflection on anything they have done before, but buy it if your already a fan!"
1,Are they going bankruptcy or something ?,"Well ... I've got no idea how the metallica guys really had the heart to release such an album. Nothing is creative. And when i say nothing i mean NOTHING. The drums, ohhhhhhhhhh, he played almost the same thing in most of the songs. Guitar solos: WHERE ARE THEY ???James' voice ??? i thought the guy went thru rehabilitation or something, but if it caused him losing his voice's stregth then i think it is better for him to go back to his addiction habits MODERATELY. I just can not believe guys who made songs like Fade To BLack, To Whom The Bell Tolls, Sanitarium, Nothing Else Matters, Orion, Call of Ktulu, The Unforgiven(s), Seek and Destroy, and lots more came out with such an album. I mean come on for F***'s sake: in one of the songs James was saying ""chick chuck chick chuck"" like many times in the song! Is this the end of their era ? i think i should have known that from their MTV Icon show !"
2,"Not that bad, but still terrible","I know that most intelligent people will ignore the poorly typed reviews of this album that either compare this to the works of Bach, or bash it like theres no tommorow, but I just had to try to set things straight. First of all, the production is terrible, but once one moves past that, there are a few compelling songs here and there. Unfortunately, the filler infesting this album is too abundant to warrant a purchase. Save your money and don't buy this subpar album."
1,One sad attempt at relevancy,"This is definitely NOT the return to their former glory. This is a desperate attempt to regain credibility and old fans that they had lost upon the release of ""Load"" (and became the band that they used to rail against). They sound like a formerly great metal band waaaay past its prime trying to sound like the current ""Nu metal"" bands. James voice no longer has the grunt it once had, in fact in spots it's downright embarrassing. Lars drums sound like metal chairs being banged. No solos (in all fairness, Kirk was pretty generic as far as metal guitar gods go). This album is yet another reminder of why the old fans abandoned them for bands (Pantera) that were playing the metal that these guys stopped and still won't. Unfortunately their days as a leading musical force are looong behind them... They should've packed it in when Cliff died."
1,Thank God We Still Have Megadeth!!!,"Hello fellow headbangers! I really believe Metallica made this CD to p*ss us people off. But I don't hate them for it, because up until 1990 they made the best thrash I've ever heard and will always remember them and cherish those CD's in my collection. But from that point on you gotta say at least Megadeth tries to stay to their roots and that's what makes them the Kings Of Thrash and I can only hope the Metallica boys will try to win it back before their too old to do it. Don't buy this, spend your $12 on ""The System Has Failed"", it did for Metallica. Bye."
4,Give It A Chance,"1st of all, we are talking about about METALLICA here, so throw out words like bad and horrible. My only complaint of this album is that James's lyrics sound different on a couple of tracks. Otherwise I love it! Everyone asked for a harder album, like those from the Eighties, and that's what Metallica gave us. Stop [complaining] about the drums, and start headbanging! I agree, that this album isn't As good as their first 5 releases, but it blows load and re-load away. ..."
5,The Best One Yet,"im only 15 and not really into 80's metal, so i can tell you right now that most of metallica's cd's i diodn't like. the black album definitley changed that for me, i got it used about 2 weeks before st. anger came out. i love em both. lars' drums rule so bad, i swear...i'm a drummer and i can tell you right now he is so good at his job!!!"
1,The real reason this cd sucks,I have it all figured out folks.The real season this cd sucks so bad is because Lars finally talked the rest of the guys into putting out material so terrible and trashy that nobody would dare download it and steal the profits from them.As a matter of fact....i'm thinking about sueing metallica to get my money back.This cd is so bad it's got some people to the point where they write in all CAPS.My god...........the humanity!!
5,I Don't Care What Anyone Says,This is a step forward for Metallica if you say different thats fine but this is much heavier than the old sound. If you are a true mettalica fan then you should soppurt this band and there Cd. And for those of you who say the drums sound like crap you all suck. The new ghetto sound of the drums brings out a heavier sound. Kind of like my garage band only that we use trash cans (yes we do have real drumsets for another drummer) to bring out the heavy sounds. Good job Metallica keep it up.
1,Metallica's St. Anger should be called St. Crap!!!!,"Why? God why? This is not Metallica. The only reason this album was made was to make a quick buck!! There is not even one good song on it. Again this does not sound like Metallica. The shame, oh the shame."
2,Metallica's best...,"This is without a doubt metallica's best album but that's not saying much. Although lyrics like ""you flush it out, you flush it out"" and ""tick-tick-tock"" are the best Hetfield has written in his career they show that he is an amateur writer. Oh and the drum technician was sick the week when they recorded the drums so Lars had to set up the drums by himself. Btw Kirks guitar technician had the flu the day they were supposed to record Kirks solos so he could not tune Kirks guitar, and Kirk couldn't tune the guitar himself, so no solos on this one baby! as Jaymz would put it. Make sure you add this or any metallica album to your collection of kid rock and limp bizkit!"
1,St. rip off,man this cd is such a disapointment..... its horrible even sum41 culd do better than this crap...... o and lars ma grandpa called me and he wants me 2 tell u he wants his coffe pots and pots back!
2,Disappointing,"I must say, I am rather disappointed with this album. No solos, which is what (I believe) makes Metallica who they are, in part. Many of the songs like St anger and some kind of monster sound very mainstream, like they could be by another band like disturbed and it would not make a difference. Also, that new kind of snare drum with the ringing is a terrible addition. It gets annoying. The vocals on this album need work. Don't get me wrong, it is still an ok album, but I thought that after 5 years Metallica would come up with something much better."
2,You can't shine a turd,"After watching the members of Metallica whine their way through the self absorbed mess of ""Some Kind of Monster"", I went out and bought ""St. Anger"". I thought that something good must have come out of that mess of a movie. I was wrong. This album is a self absorbed mess as well. My advise to Metallica: quit whining, get rid of your therapist, get rid of Bob Rock, start drinking again and think about retiring."
1,St. Crap,"I'm an old-school Metalli-Junky from the Ride The Lightning days. I've eagerly awaited and faithfully purchased-- yes, purchased, not downloaded-- every one of their CDs. I even went against popular opinion and loved both ""Lightning/Puppets"" Metallica and ""Black/Load/Reload"" Metallica. I think Bob Rock was one of the best things to happen to the band.But I'm sorry to say I cannot say with any bit of honesty that I think this album is worth the trouble purchasing or downloading. To compare St. Anger with Ride The Lightning or Kill Em All is shameful, because those are classic albums. There's nothing ""back to roots"" about St. Anger.The lyrics are dull and lack any creativity whatsoever. Kirk Hammett, who is one of the greatest guitar legends of all time, is barely noticed on this CD. The only song that I can listen to without wanting to immediately put on Master of Puppets instead is the title track. Other than that, St. Anger sucks."
1,ST. POS,"yes that's right this is a POS, how can anyone compare this to their earlier works and say it is better?!?!? For those of you who think this is better than Metallica of 10yrs ago, you all must be fans of Korn, Limp Suck, etc etc...Lars couldn't play his way out of a paper bag (good drummers=Neil Pert/Mike Portnoy) we won't even consider James singing, if you can call a moose in rut singing. KIRK for the love of god go back to your metal roots, don't let these hasbeens hold you back. and Rob why leave ozzy and zakk for Metallisuck?"
1,Is there a zero star rating?,"Absolutely pitiful. These boys seem to have lost any semblance of talent. A fan since Master of Puppets, maybe James needs to start drinking again. I know that sounds terrible, but my God, this album is complete garbage."
1,worst album ever!,I'm not the biggest metallica fan but...... the C.D. is there worst attempt at an album. don't buy the C.D.
1,2 Stars if anyone else 1 Star for Metallica,"METALLICA - St. Anger-And it would be even less if not for the song St.Anger + Frantic which are both mediocre, but not horrible.Also the Drums are aweful... Vocals are weak... And like everyone said ""Where are the guitar solos???""Jason, even though not a new member, is the only intelligent one left in the band. Oh yeah wait he left the band... That's what makes him Intelligent.Bob Rock deserves to be seriously injured. Then forced to listed to St.Anger / Load / Re-Load for the rest of eternity.-1 STARIF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:""Was this review helpful?"""
1,what happened?..i mean..seriously...,"St. Anger..so many words can describe this album(and none of the words are good). This album got so much hype and I guarantee Metallica lost a lot of fans after the release. The songs are boring and annoying. I would rather listen to Load or Re-load before this(and I wasn't a fan of those). The one thing that really made me kind of well...confused I guess were Lars drumming. Didn't they win some law-suit against Napster, can't Lars afford real drums anymore? He's resorted to trash cans apparently. Sad story really. But if you think there is hope for Metallica bringing back their old musical style then don't even bother with this. Your hopes and dreams will die in an instant. And if you have never heard a Metallica album(sad life you live) then I recommend Kill Em All up to ..And Justice For All. That is the true Metallica."
1,St. Angered that I bought this CD.,"First off, I've been a Metallica fan since 1997 with And Justice For All to the present day Re-Load album. Saint Anger is the only Metallica album that I just can not get into. I like when bands change/experiment, but this album is uncomplicated and too stripped down. Frantic is a decent song. The other 10 trackshave potential, but lack the complexity and aggressiveness thatMetallica used to possess. I've listened to this CD 23 times, it doesn't do Metallica justice. Metallica should bow there heads in shame and call it an early retirement, or make something truely worthy of listening ears. No, I don't have a mullet, drive a Camaro, not stuck in the 1980's either. Metallica, you have insulted my ears with this ..."
5,Different,"Okay, okay at first listening to this album I thought what!? Metallica changed their style!?! But then I got to thinking about it and they did it three times in the past and it worked for them every time. 1 black, 2 load, 3 reload. Each of those albums signified a turning point in Metallica.I love metallica and when I first heard these songs I didn't like them. But the more I listen the more I recognize the talent of these musicians and that they have the ability to change their style completely and still sound good. Sure James' vocals are a bit different and they have a new Bassist, Rob Trujillo, but that doesn't change the fact that it is metallica.I've heard a lot of brewhaha about the fact that Kirk Hammet plays no outstanding solos. Yeah that disappointed me too, but then look at Lars' drumming I've never heard him play so well.If you like metallica give this album a chance because a little old metalica shows through here and there and the songs are just intense."
4,The album that could have been the black album,"What I mean by that is, instead of recording the black album after Justice, this would have been the other direction. It is VERY heavy, fast, and in your face. I admit a few songs I could do without, but there is osme sweet riffing in here and in your...face lyrics. I say if your into metal, or metallica, this is worth the money. If you are expecting this to be a replica of justice, don't bother. But if you are a diehard metallica fan looking for some headbanging music, this is for you. There are only 2 things I don't like about it. One is no real solo work form Kirk, though some of the riffs might as well be they are so fast. The second is Lars's snare doesnt have the strings on and it kinda sounds bongy. But over all, this is definately worth it. Frantic, St. Anger, and Purify are my favorites. Think of it as an evolved justice album, what may have come next."
2,"No ""Justice"" for this Album!","Loving all the older Metallica albums from classics like Ride the Lightning,Masters... , Justice ..and even the Black Album became a later favourite of mine aswell - their latest St Anger is OK but where are the solo riffs that make Metallica great! Being not a big fan of Load and Reload (but still there were some great songs on there too). Not to mention their covers album was great! Alright the riffs on St Anger are good(not enough variation), the Bass if only a little bit on there, what is there to be heard is good, but not enough (no wonder Jason left!)Go buy all their other albums and you can see what a great band has become and how they should finally call it a day. At least SLAYER never sold out - go buy Slayer's latest - ""God Hates Us All"" and you will find out how to keep the fans begging for more!Metallica you have become your own harvestor of sorrow - once again why have Kirk in your band if you have no solos! Adios"
3,MORE SOLOS,"buy the cd and play it a lot. get used to their new style. im a drummer and i wish lars kept his old drums. not a fan of his snare. i hope he uses his old snare sond on tour. after you get used to the style it turns out to be a alright album. it has energy but i needed more solos by kirk. i know not every song needs one but maybe a few. liked the speedier and heavier songs but some were missing somthing. FRANTIC is awsome.o yeah, for those considering, don't move to tempe cause its hotter than satans kitchen."
2,who's gonna like this?,"DVD and all the stuff are cool, but the most importantly the songs are horrible. all of em' are just so unorganized and so repetitious. this is gotta be the most boring tallica album ever. I swear I would rather grap load/reload over st.anger."
5,"Wow, they changed...oh no they must suck then!","I cannot believe how these people can criticize this album. I will admit, when I first got home and popped the CD in my discman, all I could say are things I should not say here. But after accepting that Metallica had taken a new direction, I listened to it and fully realized how amazing this album really is. It is raw, gritty, and most of all, true. If you don't like it, stop being so close minded, it is truly excellent music."
1,what happened....,"Well, if you liked any metallica albums, don't buy this one. even the new metallica fans(load, reload etc.) wouldnt like this cd. And for the old school metallica fans, dont even think about buying it. This is by far the worst cd i've bought. if nothing else take my advise, don't buy this cd. Metallica will never seem to come back to their roots and for people who do like this cd, well we are intitled to our opinions."
1,They just don't know when to stop!,"""Hey look, we're playing fast!""Yeah, that's great. In the meantime, the very nu-metal bands that they're trying to emulate with this ... effort actually write better MUSIC and LYRICS.I never thought I would respect a Linkin Park album more than a Metallica album.Then again, I'm kinda glad that St Anger completely [stinks] -- true underground metal will remain untarnished.And BTW, whoever says that nu-metal bands are influenced by Metallica's early stuff as a pseudo-excuse for Metallica now emulating nu-metal, are really fans of nu-metal who are completely oblivious to the underground metal scene.Because real metal fans don't listen to nu-metal OR Metallica."
1,What happened?,"This was supposed to be the cd that went ""back to the roots"" of Metallica. It is not. It was, and still is compared to Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets. I do not hear any resemblence whatsoever. If it did I would have gave it 5 stars.This is horrible music. Lars sounds like he's pounding on empty coffee cans. The drums have no depth. And all the people that say Robert T. sounds good should know that he didn't play bass on the cd. The producer Bob Rock played bass on all the tracks. Robert plays on the DVD.If I wanted to listed to Limp Biscuit or Disturbed I would have bought Limp Biscuit or Disturbed. When I buy a Metallica CD I want to hear Metallica.I was looking forward to a change from Load and Reload. I was severely dissapointed when I listened to this cd. I expected a lot more from seasoned veteran professionals.If anyone knows someone that would like to buy a nearly new Metallica cd let me know, I have one for sale. If I thought I could get my money back."
1,Do Not Buy This Album If You Like Metallica,"If you like Metallica you will hate this CD. Their are no memorable riffs, no solos, no lyrics worth remembering, and a really annoying snare drum throughout the whole record. Furthermore the production is horrible and the mix is even worse. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,"Want some furious Metal ? Don't call the ""Saint"" !!","Dissapointing... where's Trujillo's killing bass ? Where are the strong chorus and riffs ?It's a rock album, but it's neither Metallica nor any other great metal band...But if you like Korn, Linkin Park, and all this non sense Nu Metal you might like it"
5,Back to the lean and mean!,"Great great effort!IT sounds so impulsive and free flowing.Lars is back, finally, drumming his a$$ off. AWESOME!I only heard it a couple of times (I'll repost in a month probably with my lasting impessions.But as important as first impressions are, it's a GREAT cd.I don't recall any awe-inspiring solos ala MOP or AJFA but they may be there for me to find.I've been a HUGE Metallica since I was 15 and now at 31 married with 3 kids, I still get the shivers when I list to the first 4 albums. Don't get me wrong, I like the other stuff too but it's not as emotionally involving as the others.Rock on MetallicA!"
1,Never sold any of my CD's except ONE,I own all the Metallica cd's except this one. It was soldabout 2 days after. Buy the Audioslave album.Slade
1,What happened to Metallica?,"Ok, I love metallica all their past stuff is awsome, i went out and bought this cd the day it came out and..it sucks! it sounds like Korn, the mixing is horrible, and unlike what everyone was saying, it does NOT go back to thier roots.I was very dissapointed with this album, if you're a metallica fan don't waste your time, or money buying this album"
4,"Insane, Tribal Metallica","Many reviewers are stuck on the fact that this does not sound like old-school Metallica. However, the album has an interesting sound that is original. Many of the individuals that trashed this album are probably 40 years old guys with big guts and mullets. Why is it so wrong for a band to experiment? Stop living in the past guys. I hate ""nu-metal"" with all my heart. This album is not ""nu-metal"". It is a raw, agressive portrait of anger. If this is nu-metal, it is a model for all the [bad] nu-metal bands. ""Limp Bizkit"" and ""Taproot"" take notice. Don't listen to the metal heads dwelling in the past."
3,Not Bad...Must listen more than once,"This isn't that bad an album. However, you have to listen to it more than once! I thought it was a piece of trash the first time but found out later that this album is pretty decent with the exception of ""invisible kid""."
4,The Boys Are Back In Town......,"After finally hearing this album, it's apparent that Metallica are moving forward with their sound. They'll never make another album like ""Ride The Lightning"" or ""Master Of Puppets,"" but the new stuff isn't all that bad. The sound on ""St. Anger"" isn't near as polished as previous efforts, as it falls into a nastier mix. From start to finish this is a pretty solid disc; just be sure to pop it in with an open mind if you don't want to be disappointed. Metallica have completely made sure that this was going to be an extremely heavy album; chugging riffs, double-bass driving, loud vocals, ALL of that is hear and presented well. The current single is the title track ""St. Anger."" ""Unnamed Feeling"" will most probably be the next single; great song. Most fans will definitely enjoy this release. I would've given ""St. Anger"" 5 Stars if it wasn't for my one complaint...............WHERE ARE THE MIND BLOWING GUITAR SOLOS?????????????"
3,Uhhh..........What the Heck??,"Ok I'm thinking new Metallica album SWEET!, but after listening to it I must say I am not very impressed with it. The first song Frantic is just all around horrible, if that had been the first Metallica song that I had ever heard I would never have started listening to Metallica and I am a die hard Metallica fan. The title song St. Anger isn't too bad, but by far Dirty Window is probably my favorite song on the CD and all the others are all right. Now don't get me wrong this isn't that bad of a CD and it's actually HEAVY Metallica has gone HEAVY again!! However, this is nowhere near their best album. I really really really hate to say this, but I think it's time for Metallica to call it quits if this is the best stuff that they can produce. All in all I think this CD is for die-hard Metallica fans only, but hey that's just my opinion."
4,Metallica is back!,"I have heard the album. It rocks!!. Metallica has gone to their roots with their classic in your face thrash metal with long 7 minutes songs. St. Anger (their first single)gives a clue about the sound in the album. The bonus DVD contains a live performance of every single track in the album. ""Damage Inc."" is back and kicking ..."
3,Heavily Underrated,"Although everyone seems to HATE this album, it's actually not that bad. Sure, it's not half as good any other Metallica (except maybe LOAD), but that dosen't mean it's bad. I consider myself a Metallica fan, owning all their albums, and I am surprised how everyone can suddenly hate Metallica because they had one CD that wasn't as good as the others. St.Anger and All Within My Hands are the best tracks on the CD. But the rest isn't THAT bad, for example Dirty Window, Some Kind of Monster, and Purify (except Purify and Dirty Window's choruses suck). It's different, and those expecting another Black Album won't be happy, but it's still OK."
1,no sac,"Ive heard about enough out of James ""Butterfield"". Anything that comes out of his mouth since 92' is throat humina humina humina. Kirk...... i hope you have a nice comfy , cozy corner in your home to do your yoga and enjoy some chocolate flavored rice cakes......DWEEB!. And the tennis player, turned Picasso whos drumming, i liked your eye liner you wore on your ""Until It Sleeps"" video. These fools can grow all the chin bushes they want and tatoo anything Bob Rock tells them to on their bodys........your 40 yr old men out of touch with what a gorged METAL bow ner is. Jeepers...i have more respect for Rob Halford as heavy metals Tinker Bell. Think about it."
2,One more chance after this one,"1- Of course this is not the 80's2-what's wrong with wanting the music to be sincere? it doesn't have to be 100mph to be good or heavy.Metallica really tried to be raw. Frantic is the best track they recorded in years though. St anger is hot. the last 2 are good too. everything in between blows.The album is 30 minutes to long, sounds like crap and has even worse lyrics.they are trying to make up for selling out in the 90's. Then all that napster crap and james, here's a jack and coke. get to writing some good tunes.the next album, if it comes out in less than 3 years, will be the true test as to what there legacy will be. right now, they are in a funk.albums 1-4 are the metal standard. 5 is ok. 6-8 can kiss it.time will tell."
2,The St. stands for [WEAK],"well, uh, a very dissappointing effort, to say the least. ... There are some bright points in the title track and Dirty Window, but for the most part, James just doesn't rock like he used to, and the drums sound like freaking tom-toms. If they change a lot of things, their next album could be amazing. ...""There are only two kinds of people I can't stand in this world. People who are inconsiderate of other cultures, and the Dutch."""
2,Meh!,"I said Meh! M E H. Meh.Metallica is not the same band it once was. Except for a few songs on this album, it all sounds the same and forgettable. If they are still around in five years they won't be playing any of this on their tour playlist any more than they do ""The Struggle Within"" these days. They've lost the speed, they've lost the edge. Too much drums, average bassist, the death of the guitar solo, and the dry echo-less vocals contribute to making this forgettable. Ah, Cliff, you left us too soon."
2,Why Lars? Why?,"Having been a big Metallica fan for years, I was truely expecting that St. Anger would live up to all of its hype and be the true return-to-roots we've all dreamed of. Unfortuneatly, as with Load and Reload, Metallica has continued to experminent with their sounds and musical style. St. Anger is that experiment gone horribly wrong. The audio quality is terrible. Not even on par with an average video cassette, the CD is what I would call ""Low-Fi"". The singing style is more like that of Linkin Park and Korn. That's not a good thing. Gone are the ""cool"" solos from previous albums, as are any and all concepts of harmony. Probably the worst thing about the album is the sound of the drums. Lars sounds like he's banging on a trashcan lid. With all of the money he has, you would think he could have spent $[...] on a Remo dampener, or at least taped a sock to the drum head. Do yourselves a favor and save your money for something else."
2,Not Metallica,"This album is not very good to say the least. There are no solos, Lars' drums sound more like tin garbage cans than anything else, and the songs generally have no substance.I think Metallica needs to go back to the old way of recording. Spend a full year in the studio working together on great material. With James having been in rehab and Jason having left the band recently, I can only assume they have been under serious pressure to release some sort of ""album,"" and I guess this is it.Despite all of this, I haven't lost all hope that Metallica will turn things around and somehow re-learn how to create an album of the caliber they used to, albums where EVERY SINGLE song was awesome. (i.e. pre-Load) Back in those days James and Lars WERE Metallica.Well, at least the album is heavy. Frantic is really about the only good song on the album, IMO."
3,St. Anger,"I originally had 3 other Metallica CD's: Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets and The Black Album. Compared to the classic albums, St. Anger is pretty bad. The classic Metallica albums will always stand out as the best Metallica cds, and they will be next toimpossible to recreate the type and feel of those albums. St. Anger also shows a different type of music than the classic albums, it shows the influence of newer rock/metal. Since the death of Cliff Burton, Metallica's music has changed. It was evident on The Black Album, instead of a thrash-metal album like Kill Em' All, Ride The Lightning, and Master Of Puppets, The Black Album was more of a headbanging album. St. Anger just isn't as good as the classics."
1,Without a Doubt [garbage],"I've always been a big Metallica fan since I was in junior high. I own several of their albums and have been very happy with them until I bought St. Anger. As a fan I feel terrible saying this, but the album is just [garbage]. You can play through the first couple of songs and think it will get better, but it doesn't. There is not a song on that CD that I can force myself to listen to. I highly suggest anyone considering buying this album to forget it. Stick with the old albums so you won't be disappointed in the band as a whole. Maybe the whole Napster ordeal took a tole on them musically."
2,Next to their worst album...........,"This was a waste of $10.....I only like 2 songs on here (St. Anger and Frantic). I listened to it about 3 times since I bought it.....I just can't get into it. I'm still a #1 fan, but thank god they only play about TWO songs off this album at their concerts... This is a little better than Load/ReLoad......but not much!"
4,The DVD Saved It.,"Let's face it: This album sucked. It did. And I'm a Metallica fan.But let's look at it this way: The members of Metallica spent a lot of their precious hours putting this and their other 7 studio albums together. If Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield didn't meet up to jam in 198(3?), then what would us Metallica fans have?This album is a lot better than the crap bands we hear nowadays. *cough*Godsmack*cough*Limp Bizkit*cough*AFI*cough*Sure, the album's own track (St. Anger) was bad, and The Unnamed Feeling is overrated, but so what? We still have 9 other tracks to hear. Frantic is still my favorite track on this CD.And let's talk about the DVD, shall we? It was what convinced me to finally buy this CD a week ago. It's the edited version from Wal-Mart, but who cares?St. Anger, overall: Bad, but the DVD saved it."
2,MetalliBLAH!,"THIS is there comeback album? Absolutely the worst Metallica album ever. I think the boys miss Mr. Newstead more than they would admit. The lyrics are weak, the drum sound is awful, and the production is terrible. I am just glad I only paid [$] for it. I am very disappointed to say the least. I see why they pushed the release date up to counter internet piracy. Anyone that hears this before they buy it...wouldn't waste their money."
3,hmm... not sure yet...,"Metallica promised a real heavy album, like the good old days. This is album is pretty heavy, but nothing like the GOOD old days. So far it sounds to me like a heavier version of Load and ReLoad, same style but much heavier.I am listning to it now for the second time... so far i am not too impressed :( but maybe it'll grow on me. I guess i was hoping more for the old Metallica school style, but i think that's pretty much gone. Oh well... we have 5 albums to enjoy."
5,THE BEST 90S METALLICA ALBUM!,"I got my copy and it kicks [rear-end]! I never heard Metallica that cool and heavy since And justice! A must have for all fans, Metallica RULZ! Only heavy-metal wannabies wont by this album!"
3,Where did the solo's go!?,"When I think of Metallica, the first thing that comes to mind is the sublime solo in Master of Puppets.This is not that Metallica.Some of the riffs and speed of the songs here are kinda cool, but overall, its just not Metallica enough. Many of the songs could've been more streamlined. St Anger did not have to be so long. It would've at least been less boring if a solo or two had been thrown in there to break up a lot of the redundancy of song structure.Another irritating niggle about this album is the new bass player... That does not contribute to a song at all...Basically, if like hard rock, you'll dig this album, in fact, if you think of it that way, its not totally bad, but if you are expecting another Ride the Lightning...do yourself a favor and start listening to Slayer. I recommend Seasons in the Abyss, Reign in Blood, and South of Heaven."
1,Oh How the Mighty Have Fallen,"I couldn't do it. I couldn't even get through the entire CD. By track 8 I was in agony, it was so bad!! This is hands down the worst CD I was ever stupid enough to purchase. Metallica have completely lost their way. They are devoid of any decent musical ideas. ""Shoot Me Again"" was almost tolerable, but was really more a perfect description of what any listener of this [stuff] will be begging somebody to do. Metallica should be put out of OUR misery."
3,just 'ok',"well i just finished listening to half of the songs on this new metallica albumn and im afraid to say im a little bit let down. st. anger is a somewhat return to the hard and heavy days of old, but theres just nothing catchy on here. st. anger really isnt that great of a single and the sound quality sounds like it was recorded in a garage with a tape player on record. maybe i need to give it some more listens but with a metallica albumn i shouldnt have to. reload had some great songs on it, from the memory remains to unforgiven 2. i hope if they get around to it, their next album is a return to the black albumn days."
2,Eh,"Overall I was very dissapointed with this album. This album is by far one of the worst Metallica albums... sure it's back to their roots of thrash, but overall it leaves you dissapointed.Throughout the whole CD all I heard was LARS' DRUMS! They took up most, if not all, of the songs! If the drums weren't so loud, then it would be a good album, Lars really ruined it. Also the CD quality itself is fairly poor, it doesn't sound crisp, just muffled...The only good song on it is 'Invisible Kid' the rest are eh..."
2,who are these imposters?,"Upon listening to this album, I like to share a few thoughts. I have a few theories. Maybe all the band members got sick during recording and the technies and roadies had to fulfill the deadline and pick up the instruments. Or even more absurd, the aliens came and abducted James,Lars, and Kirk, and had them replaced with something else. Maybe that'll explain why the songwriting, production is some of the worst I've ever heard. Now I know liking music is greatly subjective, but production level can be gauged. If Bob Rock produced this, I suggest him get a new line of work. I burst out laughing listening to the first track, Frantic. Wait, this is suppose to be a metal record, not Robin Williams telling jokes. Listen to James ""sing"" tick tock, tell me if it's not funny.I have followed Metallica in the early 80's to the Black Album. St. Anger-- I'm not sure if I'm suppose to cry or laugh. It's sad to say the pioneer of metal has been reduced to this..."
1,St. Diarrhea,I think all of the inmates from the St. Anger video should kick the band and the producer's butt for making such an awful record.
1,The muppets could do better,"Just keep this in mind. EVERYONE who gave this album a positive review all say the same thing. ""You have to let it grow on you."" or ""After I listened to it 63 times it actually wasn't so bad.""NEWS FLASH... good albums are just that. They don't need to ""grow"" on anything. This album is a complete joke. My nine year old nephew may have even written a few of the songs. Metallica is down to selling junk music solely on their name.Save your money and donate it to a charity that would help the feeble minds of ANYONE who actually thinks this album is worth listening to. It's not even worthy of the 1 star I had to give it to write this review."
2,definitely not their best,"a few decent songs but the rest are not good at all. Some these songs represent the longest five minutes you'llever have to spend listening to a song. The song purify hasto be the dumbest, most unoriginal thing that they have ever done. Fred Durst could've written a better song and he sucks lately. This album is the toilet paper to wipe the great master of puppets and black album's asses. Anyone who compares the two is crazy."
2,Crap takes on a new name...,"I didn't want to believe it when I first listened to it but it was true. St. Anger is possibly one of the worst albums Metallica has ever made. And what's even more sad is how many more new fans they have because of this album and they love it. I give this two stars because although it was a horrible album, there maybe two good tracks; Frantic and The Unnamed Feeling. The rawness of the production was there, reminiscent of their earlier recordings like Kill 'Em All, but it can't compare to that album at all. The live DVD was a nice little feature that had all of the songs played live in Metallica's HQ, but it still doesn't save the crappiness of the songs. If you must buy the album, buy it used or steal it or download it to piss off Lars, it's not worth the full price."
1,What the hell!,"Let me start off by saying that I love Metallica, always have, always will, but what the hell happened? I can't find a single thing about this album that doesn't make me cring in pain. The production is bad, and the drums sound like crap. I have a trash can in my kitchen that makes the same noise (...). Lars, what are you doing? I do Like the fact that we finally have some heaviness returning to good ol' Metallica, but I am very dissapointed. I suggest buying this album, because it is Metallica, but get it used or at a pawn shop, or something, its horrible."
2,Well Well Well,"To answer all the questions about what happend to Metallica, I have the answer. Bob Rock, The hair cuts, And there record lable. This cd is the biggest cluster f$%^ i have ever heard. Way too many time changes. The drums all but the snar were ok clang clang Hey Lars there's this little lever on the side of the snar drum flip it UP the next time.The music on the DVD was mixed better than the cd. Maybe the dvd was the real cd and the cd was all the outakes or something. come on Metallica you can do better than ST. Anger.P.S Let your hair grow back. Get back to the good ol days of Justice..."
1,"Clang, Clang, Clang St.Anger Sucks","We were all pumped for the new Metallica album but when it finally came, You were either shocked or sickend or both. This album sucks big time. One minute your listeing to a decent riff and then suddenly, your listeing to crap. The snare is annoying, the songs are too long, and James singing is terrible. I've heard Nu metal singers sound better then him and that's pretty bad. This is not the same band. Just look at their logo and the album cover. What is that? Wow!! A Hand!! A Red Hand!!! A Red Hand with rope on it!! Sorry Metallica, but with this album, you make LOAD look like MASTER OF PUPPETS!"
1,Beating a dead horse . . .,"Yup this album sucks. The remarkable thing is how both ""old"" (pre black album) and ""new"" metallica fans have almost universally panned this record. I've heard of ""stripped-down production"" but this record simply sounds amateurish. It really is a tragedy and here's to hoping that no more good bands succumb to this ""dumbing down"" trend and throw away all their growth and maturity and regress back to suckdom."
2,Lackluster Effort from Metallica,"While the band promised a return to it's roots, this album is a poorly produced effort. On this record, Metallica sounds like a garage band, rather than a metal powerhouse. Where are the guitar solos? The lyrics to the songs are also weak. I'd have to give this a new name- St. Fair!"
2,Just don't buy it,"I got this album when it first came out, I remember when I first popped it in my CD player, I thought there was something wrong with it, but nope...what I was hearing was what they had made. After a few listens though it kinda grew on me, I'll admit its a great jam album. However it quickly became less and less appealing, to the point where I took it off my computer (I rip all my CDs) and buried the CD in a dark cavern under my bed. Quite frankly now I think this album sucks, its monotonous, repetetive, simple (drop tuned guitars?!?!?!?!?!), and poorly produced.I think I should target 2 groups of people. If you like pop/rock music like Linkin Park and whatnot, you might like this, I don't know what you crazy kids look for in music. If you're like me and like death/black metal and OLD metallica, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DONT BUY THIS!!!! You'll end up breaking the disc in half and gourging out your ears."
2,I bought this cd twice,"I originally bought St. Anger like everybody else ""cause it's METALLICA!!!!!!!!!I popped it in my player asap and within a half an hour of playing it ---that's jumping through tracks b/c it was annoying--I took it out.Metallica has changed alot over the years-alot since the Black Album which I gather is the LAST COMPLETELY GREAT Album they have made.God help me if it is their last.St. Anger is just not the Metallica I grew up with and love--I can't stand it!I gave my copy to relative for Christmas present and bought used copy for like five dollars later on.Why? Just in case there's a slim chance I may like it someday.Whatever you do-BUY IT AS CHEAP AS POSSIBLE!!!!!"
1,St. Shi t,I wasn't fooled this time by marketing hype and mega bucks.This is pure crap on a hugh heaping steaming pile of SH!X Metallica fan.....
1,Not worth the effort,"Metallica is a ghost of it's former self. Not worth the price of admission. The guys are old and balding now, way past their prime."
1,Metallica needs to retire permanently!,"This is the worst album I've heard in the 21st century and I tried to avoid the junk at all costs. But it seems my Anti-CD-Spam failed with this. And it is definitely worst Metallica album ever - even Reload, compared to *this*, sounds so damn fresh and new.Someone in these reviews said something very true: Who are they to be ""St. Anger"" in their age, in their villas, pools? They can be sad (I bet they are) and pitiful (sure), like the most of the very rich crew, but certanly not angry. They are (re)loaded, they are part of this megalomanic and capitalistic society and all they want now is to make some easy money on the kids and teenagers (I only know 14-16 year olds that liked this) based on their old fame.They should permanently retire and leave their great <91' material alone!P.S. At least we didn't get The Unforgiven III. Maybe in the next ReRelease, who knows?"
3,Just not Metallica...,"Hello all, i'm a Metallica fan, and for some reason i bought this cd. They got the sound but the drums sound like trashcans. So the drums are horrible, but otherwise they have a decent sound. But lyrically...these lyrics could've been written by a 3rd grader. I mean damn, no complexity whatsoever. ""my life style determines my death style"" i mean c'mon. The lyrics are just horrendous. All they have to do is keep that sound just..with real drums, and at least think about the lyrics they're writing. But uhh if you have an extra 15 bucks and find this on sale i guess pick it up. It's not a jewel like Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets"
1,"Metallica didn't ""sell out"" until now","I've always loved Metallica. In fact I was one of the few true fans who enjoyed and appreciated (at least most) of Load and ReLoad. Everyone talked about Metallica ""selling out"" for the last 3 albums. Wrong. They did what they wanted to do and nothing was forced, they remained true to themselves. For ""St. Anger"" every track feels forced and uninspired. James Hetfield's inspiration is all dried up. The band is done, the creativity is gone. The band put pressure on itself to release St. Anger and they've got nothing left. This album shouldn't bear the Metallica name."
1,St. Dissappointment,"Ok, Im not going to beat around the bush. I hate this album. There's not a song on it that I enjoy. I desperately tried to let this album to grow on me, but it just didn't happen. There are a lot of things that I don't like about this album, I really don't even know where to start. The drums are probably the worst aspect of ""St. Anger"" they just sound bad. The lyrics aren't much better. I could not in good conscience recommend this album to anyone."
1,St. Suck,"I am just asking people to stop buying this album. I have to put up with this poo every day. I would describe why it sucks, but I'm afraid of Metallica sueing me or making me apologize with some horrid lawsuit that costs so much money out of Lars's pocket that he has to sell another painting or move into a smaller mansion.BTW, Metallica no longer thanks you underground listeners that made them famous in the first place. You are all freeloaders and the RIIA is going to come and get you!"
1,AAAAAAH!! THE DRUMS!!! THE DRUMS!!!! STOP!!,"WHAT is Lars playing on???? A frying pan set??WHERE the hell are the solos?? You've got Kirk in your band but you don't play solos???HOW can Metallica lower itself to the level of nu-metal?? Their last albums (post black album) sucked but this is ridiculous!!I give up, I don't get this band any more, from the purest brilliance ever (master of puppets) to this?? It's allmost surreal. This CAN NOT be Metallica! O hell! This ain't Metallica! HELP! Evil aliens took over Metallica and are trying to have every metalhead in the world commit suicide because of this @!#$*&^!!KILL 'EM ALL!"
1,Terrible...just Horror...,"to save your soul DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! i can see it now...metallica is just lica no metal left i can say cliff burton in his heaven is probably trying to plug his poor ears to kill this terrible, disgusting, horrible music thats called ""Metallica"" its sad to see a band that was once a ""Thrash"" metal band now just sell-out lying sons of b*tches there is no hope left for metallica move onto a better band like slayer or antrhax or maybe follow ex-metallica member Dave Mustaines Megadeath whatever you do just dont buy this horrible album..."
5,... Yeah!,"Definitely worth your money. Not your average Metallica though. No outstanding solos. Drop-tuned guitars. Different singing. Different lyrics. Different approach to their music all-together. Several bands seem to be changing their musical style lately. AFI, Cradle of Filth, and now Metallica. They sure pulled it off though. This album is truly awesome and was worth the long wait for its coming. What else can i say? Amazing recording. Five Stars Easy. Tip of the hat to Metallica. ... Yeah!"
2,Holy [garbage],"What happened? The metal gods have been replaced with some band playing way too simple riffs with lousy song structure and lyrics so bad they're low end of nu-metal whine.There is next to no soloing (which is like telling Da Vinci to paint a house) and little display of mastery of any instrument or singing. The only bright spot is some awesome drumming, which is still irritating becaue of a tinny snare drum.Yep, it's hard and rauchy, but it also shows a skill level no better than a garage band. Guitar lines are short, songs are redundant and uninpired.MetallicA always claims to do what they want, but to go from Master of Puppets, down to Reload and then to this?...you have to wonder what the hell they really want.If you liked the 'St. Anger' single, by all means, this album's for you. But if you had enough of the single after a few listens, then you'll be very bored with this album."
1,Once they were great; now they are a joke (a rich one!),"Metallica succumbed ""ONCE AND FOR ALL"".The slow decline into mediocrity begun in the nineties now came to its zenith. And they fell with a bang, that's for sure. No matter how, people will be talking about this album for years, for best or for worse, due to its sheer ausence of quality, connection, production, good vocals, guitar solos, decent snare sounding, cover art, obnoxious lyrics.Some years ago, I vowed to never ever again give one cent of dollar to this band, buying their products or seeing their live concerts. And I've stuck to my promise. I listened to this album by downloading it, LAR$."
1,Waste of cash.,"I was all hyped about getting this album with the early release and reading all of the reviews about it that turned out to be nothing but lies. This album was possibly the worst thing that I have ever bought in my life. In fact, I think that it somehow gave me the flu for two weeks when I originally purchased it. I tried taking it back to the CD Warehouse and they wouldn't even take the album because they had so many used copies in stock. Get some real music like Led Zeppelin."
1,Stale and tired.,After repeated attempts to get into St. Anger I have to admit I REALLY don't like anything on this record. We (and the band themselves) should accept the fact that Metallica are washed up.They sound like a broken down basement band devoid of creative fire and state of the art chops especially compared to new hungry outfits like Lamb of God for instance. That's not to say that a band of Metallica's stature should nessacarily be stacked up against other more recent bands who have youth and the benefit of building on the metal legacy Metallica themselves spearheaded but even on their own terms there is no excuse for putting out boring ill concieved and poorly executed material. Beyond a big let down more like the last straw. The best thing about St. Anger is the film Some kind of Monster which as it turns out is a sad documentation of a once powerful and relevant musical force who have not yet realized they should call it a day.
1,And you thought S&M sucked,This album is so bad that after getting duped by saying they were going back to being hardcore again i literally shot my cd to death. Load and Reload were horrific and S&M was a joke and Saint Anger left me disillusioned. I think Metallica should hang up the towel and leave the music scene. Even now live they are slow and terrible. This band needs to be beaten with stick.
1,Utter garbage,"Lifeless crap from a bunch of overfatted has-beens. And if you really want to feel some pain, see that god-awful documentary done about this bunch of rich, greedy (lest we forget their obsessive Napster fetish) whiners - the excrable ""Some Kind of Monster""."
1,Nowhere near what old metallica was,this cd sucks they dont have what they used to back in the day and i would recomend to anyone to buy megadeths new cd instead of this it sounds much better
1,They sold out again,"Let's just put it this way; there are no guitar hooks, no riffs you can remember after you've listened to the album, no solos, shabby production(lars' snare sounds like he's drumming on some tin cans), hetfield trying to sing, dull and shallow lyrics, drum rhythms that change so fast that you get the impression that the whole album is a load of noise..."
1,HOLY S**T what happened??,"Wow. this is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. Ever. This really sucks, and Metallica is my favorite band of all time!! This was pretty much one of the the biggest disappointments of my entire life. I hate this album. The repetition, the bad lyrics...WHAT HAPPENED METALLICA!? This was one of those things I tried so hard to like, but it just didn't happen. Anyone who likes this album doesn't know good music. At all."
1,Master of Crap!,"I'm gonna keep this short and sweet. I have nothing positive to say about this cd, so I won't. It sucks! How did they ever come to this?! Hey Metallica; go back on the drugs...your music was better."
1,St. $#!T,"This has to be the worst album ever put out by anyone! And to have it come by one of the hardest bands of the 80's is a testament to the times. Times have certainly changed, and not for the better.-Hetfield strains his voice to painful levels, and plays the axe like a retard having a seizure.-Ulrich's drums sound like garbage cans.-Hammet and the bass player (Ugly Ogre, I call him) just melt into the background.-No solos.-Nothing good.-The DVD only shows you them playing these songs, and isn't worth the plastic it's burned on.+The only good thing (and not worth $15) is the cover art by Pushead.Any hardcore Metallica fan will definitely want to pass on this one. Not since Justice have they released a great album."
1,Horrible Album,"I bought this album as soon as it came out unfortunately. This is by far Metallica's worst album. The drumming is so bad I can't even make it through the first 2 songs on the CD. It sounds like lars was banging on garbage cans. Save your money at all costs and buy the first four Metallica albums. Its really sad that the band released this piece of crap. Metal by and large has been on a downward trend. Metallica may be the most famous metal band in the world. But seriously when was the last time they put out a decent album. Load was crap, reload had 1 good song at most. The Garage Inc Covers album was good. Everyone had such high hopes that this album would give metal bands in general a big boost and it didn't happen. The band will continue to be a force with its live shows but even the band will want to forget they made this worthless album.P.S. I want my $16.00 back Lars I can't even sell this on E-bay for a penny."
2,just a poor effort,"no solos, one true riff, drums sound like marching band drums, listen to the album with headphones on and ur ears will hurt from the sound comming off the drums. i like the first 2 songs, the rest of the songs sound the same but with the ""riffs"" arragned in different order by song. this album just seemed rushed, if they would have taken there time they would have more lyrics to the songs, more riffs, actually put a solo on the album. hat's off to BOB ROCK for possibly releasing his first bad cd, might have killed his career in my opinion, i could have probably downloaded the album off the internet with better sound.the only positive is i only spent 10 bucks on the thing and it came with a dvd that had the first 2 songs on it as well as the others, but i only like the first 2 so what's the point u know. if u can, don't buy it u'll be dissapointed"
1,"Before St Anger: Metallica fan, after it: I am confused","I am very sorry to say that this album totally SUCKS and dont even deserve 1 star. I dont know what the hell happened to Metallica. Awfull music, awfull vocals and back vocals, no solos, ??. I am pretty sure this is the end for Metallica, and a s a fan I am really sorry."
1,Has potential 2 get better,i dont think its that good....but maybe after listening 2 it a couple times it'll get better. when i 1st heard st anger *the song* i thought it sucked but once i heard it more it started 2 grow on me. so im guessing the cd probably has the same effect. the only song i really liked besides st anger was sweet amber. maybe the rest of the cd will grow on me in time.
3,St. Anger is all it claims to be,"Metallica promised a rawer album and they delivered just that. Songs lack set structures, all instruments have a lo-fi sound, and vocals were obviously written spontaneously without much thought. They've captured a primal sound here, sacrificing the polish that so many bands rely on to make their record sound good.Personally, I believe this is a step in the right direction. The drum sound that so many people are complaining about is a refreshing change of pace from top 40 radio. Too many talentless bands spend millions of dollars in the studio making music that may sound great, but doesn't really represent them. Granted, I don't like all the songs on this CD, many are simply too long, and a few (""St. Anger"" among others) are clunkers. But with songs like ""Dirty Window"", ""My World"", and ""Shoot Me Again"", they hit the nail on the head.This is the realest and rawest album to grace the mainstream in a long time and for that, Metallica earns my respect."
1,Would they have made this album if Cliff was alive???,No more classical Guitar Intro'sNo more 8 minute instrumentalsNo more Thought provoking lyricsNo more Insane Lead guitarNo more NewsteadNo more Metallica ......
3,"BETTER THAN LOAD AND RELOAD, BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH","St. Anger, in my opinion, is a pretty good cd. The snare drum ring gets pretty annoying at times. I'm not sure what's up with the sound quality. I guess if it sounded any clearer, the snare ring would blow your tweeters up. On the other hand, I think song #1, Frantic, is their best effort since 'Justice'. Dirty Window and Shoot Me Again are real good, also. Call me crazy but ,at times, I get the feel of the 'Revenge' album from Kiss."
1,"Worst, Most Disappointing CD of the Century.","Boy, did Metallica pull a number on the public this time! They hyped the return of the classic Metallica sound on the MTV ""Icon"" show and played a medley of their classics and promised new classics from the latest CD. Well, there are no new soon-to-be-classic songs on St. Anger and, surprisingly, the whole CD is even worse than ""Reload"" or ""Load"". The lyrics are stupid, the drumming is bad, and there are no real good guitar solos. In addition, the band seems to be trying too hard. Nothing is natural and nothing flows here. It just sounds like one long boring yell fest. I was suckered. Don't let this happen to you!!"
2,"They've done it, they've angered hell","Metallica has finally done it. They have angered all off hell and soon all of its hatred with come to claim them. Lars snare has an infinite ping that would disturb a deaf man, the first time i heard this album it triggered multiple violent vomitting sessions. Where is General V and Eddie, they need to be summoned to deal with these humiliations. It's as if they defied all laws of music theory to please the public. The rythme makes absolutely no sense, the lyrics and music has less emotions than a souless corpse. Do they really think that this album was good? I am still in disbelief after watching it. But whos fault is it? Metallica, Bob Rock, and whats worse, Metallica for putting out this waste or the people who spent their money on it and gave it over 2 stars? I want my old boys back."
4,Unpolished,"I have been a Metallica fan since 1983's Kill 'Em All album,St Anger is NOT they're greatest cd by any means,It sounds like it was recorded in one take,and wasnt touched up in the studios.But hey...It's still Metallica,so aside from the annoying ""snare"" drum sound..and the ""unpolished"" sound...I'll give it 4 stars,cuz it still ROCKS!!!"
2,disappointment,"After listening to the album more than a few times, all I can say is that I am disappointed. Seems as if Metallica is trying to catch-up with the times as oppose to trying to define it. Don't expect to find any remnants of what was good in their earlier days, it's mostly angry screaming and tin-can drum beats. Sadly I must admit that I have already written them off as a dead band."
1,Poor Attempt,"First thing I hear is how they are making an album that will suposedly bring them back to their old roots of speed metal and hard riffs but alas not a single one of the unoriginal sounding songs impressed me. i own every metallica album and what the successful albums had st anger does not. I miss the hard riffs with the melodic solos intertwined and the several different movements that they would perform like musical acrobats from an original sounding intro to verse to chorus rinse and repeat then throw in a totally awesome sounding interlude then back to chorus then to a heart pounding outro. I was bored with every single song on here. Sorry guys, but dont count me in for summer sanitarium 2003. not too mention the horrible bands that will be playing this one ::coughcoughlimpbizkitcough::"
1,Die Already Mecrapica!!,"I was a huge fan of Metallica from Kill 'em all through Justice. I grew up idolizing these guys. I think it's safe to say that they have let the music world down again by creating a new drink coaster for our collective coffee tables. This cd is terrible. The production is hideous. The drum sound is almost laughable. Lars is the worst drummer in rock/metal today. Metallica has lost every ounce of creativity that they once had by simply going through the motions. It seems as though they think that the general public is oblivious to the fact that they all sat around and came up with a perfect marketing and money making strategy which is to give us exactly what we want. There's one problem--we are not frozen souled, geriatric zombies like Metallica. They brought back the syncopated hits and speed of Puppets and Lightning, the anger of Justice, and the crunch of the black album, but forgot to actually [care]..."
1,St. Awful,"Lars sounds like he's banging on tin cans and cardboard boxes. James sounds like he's yelling into a plastic bucket. Kirk sounds like...wait a minute, I don't even hear him on the album. Rob, the new token bassist, just fills in an empty space. This album was mixed horribly. And frankly, I'm a little insulted by their attempt to return to their heavier roots (with a little nu metal flavor added to guarantee radio airplay) after they've worked so hard at eliminating a large percentage of their true fans by releasing [garbage] like Load & Reload. Every 5 years since 1990 I give these guys a chance to redeem themselves. After hearing St. Anger, I realize that this once truely great band, who I've supported since 1983, is dead. At least I still have Master Of Puppets."
1,worst as of yet,"I bought the Metallica album the day it came out, and sold it 2 days later. This has to be the worst album I have ever heard. The lyrics are elementary, the production/recording is horrible, the drums sound like they are in a tin can throughout the entire album and there is not one guitar solo on the album. I wouldn't even give this 1 star. Also they give you a code for getting extras, but I kept having problems so I gave up. Sorry, but major dissapointment on this one."
2,a big let down,"i have been a metallica fan since ""ride the lightning"", so i can be a fair judge.the songs here have a hard time making their point, they are long and sometimes boring. what ever happened to the 3 or 4 minute quality jam. kirk hammet (lead guitar) is way too quiet on this one....no solo's. i realize that ""and justice for all"" had some long song's on there......but at least they sounded good!!!! the drums sound a little funny on st. anger, it sounds like lars is pounding on tin cans.i guess i started to question metallica's quality of music when the released re-load and what's the deal with the orchestra cd they put out a few years ago. iam sure that cliff burton turned over in his grave (god rest his soul). bottom line here is: save your money. buy the ""older metallica cd's (kill 'em all, ride the lightning, master of puppets, garage inc.)"
2,I waited outside the record store for this,"So dissapointed....I love heavy metal & a lot of it's subgenders....but this almost borders unto being that [bad] death metal...just noisy with no sort of harmony overall....and don't get me wrong...I love METALLICA! I know that many of you will say that heavy metal is supposed to be raw and angry and let me tell you that I couldn't agree more....but that doesn't mean that it should have bad engineering, production and worst of all no harmony, no great lyrics & to end it James sounds awful....it's just noise...Stick to all other Metallica work.....just avoid this one...oh and check out engine's ""superholic"" raw heavy metal with great lyrics, instruments and great vocals to compliment a superb album.Hope this was helpful & by no means do I mean any disrespect to METALLICA fans....I am one too.Rock on and UP THE IRONS!!!"
1,Disappointed in this,"The hype around this album was that Metallica would be getting back to their roots, playing like they did on ""Master of Puppets"" or ""...and Justice for All."" This is not the case.This album sounds like it was recorded underneath of the drumset. This is not a guitar album, like Metallica used to make. Instead, it's just annoying drumming, background guitar, and badly written vocals. There isn't any impressive guitar work at all on this, let alone the characteristic solo, and it seems as if James Hetfield and Kirk Hammett have just stopped trying. I've been a Metallica fan for a while, but this is just noise.If you like the ""old"" Metallica from the Cliff Burton-era, stay away from this album. If you like the Jason Newsted-era Metallica, avoid this like the plague. But, if you like garage rock by stadium bands, by all means, waste your money on this disappointing album."
1,what the ...?,"2 words....this [stinks]. this has to be the worst metallica release yet. are they trying to fit in or something. they should go back to what they are good at. i dont give it a zero because i cant, and there are no obnoxious guitar leads. thats the only good thing."
1,St. Crap,"You would think that after several years without a CD with original music on it Selloutica would have come up with something better than this. I forgave them after the Black album because at least it SOUNDED like Metallica. Both of the Load CD's were a load off [garbage] but at least S&M and Garage inc brought back the Metallica of old, but this new one doesn't sound anything like Metallica. More like the cookie cutter bands of today; no soul, feelings, or identity. I had to keep checking my CD player to see if it kept starting over when the tracks changed, that's how much all the songs sound the same!! Speaking of sound, did Lars add an empty 55 gallon drum to his set? It sure sounds like it and it doesn't sound good at all. Now I know why the DVD comes with the CD, it's so you don't feel so bad for spending [money] on something so bad!! I can't even reccomend this for a free internet download."
4,Death By Snare Drum,"It is good to see Metallica playing heavy music again. This CD is very raw and not over-produced. It also marks antoher change of direction for the band, back to an earlier style, although do not expect Master of Puppets. Metallica has learned from Load and Reload, and those experiences are present on St. Anger, primarily in the fact that James sings, rather than barks out lyrics as her did on earlier albums.The largest drawback to the album is the fact that Lars sound like he is playing a Fisher Price drumkit. The snare drum is so loud and overbearing (not to mention that it does not sound like a snare) that it makes some songs difficult to listen to.Welcome back!"
4,What this is....,"Well....what can I say. This album is brilliant. Music is top notch and the energy is definetly up there. Now everyone expected some old school metallica and thus gave it [bad] reviews because it apparently doesn't sound metallica. But what really is metallica. Metallica is making something different each album, and not going back to something cuz they need the public attention. So in closing i say this album is wicked for it's originality, and power. I will agree that the fifth star is not there due to the lack of hammet solo's, and some weak lyrics (only in a few tunes). But I will definetly recommend this album to any true metal fan."
2,Dissapointing,"The first time I listened to this, I was listening as a ""they can do no wrong"" fan. But after hearing my peers, coments, I listened as a music fan. And I saw many flaws in this.Okay, Robert Trujullo(or however his name is spelled) breaths new life into the band, but they are trying way to hard to recapture thier old sound. Sounds like MC Hammer trying to do gansta rap.I guess metallica lost all credibility after the whole napster scandle, but I really wanted to like this one. But these guys are way past thier prime."
2,A Different Sound For Metallica!,"This is definitely a change from the Load/Reload days and absolutely unmatched to the early Metallica days. For those who are into the current alternative sound, you will be pleasantly surprised. If you are hoping to hear the Metallica sound that's so dearly loved (i.e. Creeping Death, One, Master of Puppets), then you will be utterly disappointed. I bet Kirk Hammett was playing in his sleep...where the heck are all those inexhaustible lead solos?? Lars' drums, especially the cymbals, sound mechanical. It's hard to believe that Bob Rock actually produced this CD.It's cool that a DVD of the rehearsals is included, but I really don't care to watch a rehearsal of songs that I don't care for. Too bad this technology wasn't around during 1984-1990. That would have totally rocked!!!I commend Metallica for trying something new, but as a long-time Metallica fan, I miss that ""Metallica sound"" that once was there."
2,What happened?,"First off, I would buy the next 10 Metallica albums regardless of how I feel about this one, but I am very dissapointed. It's almost as if they put too much into it. The lyrics are repetative to say the least. The guitar is great but without any stand-alone solo's and Lars is awesome on the drums. Even though idividually they all get A's, the end product is noise without direction. I have listened to the entire album at least ten times waiting for it to grab ahold of me, but none of the songs have. I am glad that I bought the album, but am desperately awaiting the next. Kudo's to the band for releasing the DVD, it makes the album a great value."
3,disappointing,"When I first listened to this cd I was very disappointed. The performance fits very nicely into metal today, but lacks the quality you find in Metallica's previous albums. This album has very little variety other than its raw energy sound. One thing that set Metallica apart from other bands initially was the amazing technical ability of its members, but this album provided no test to their ability. I would have to say the 2 best songs on the album are ""Shoot Me Again"" and ""All Within My Hands"". Other than those, this album was rather mediocre."
2,End of Metallica,"The highlight of this cd is the DVD included. I am a metallica fan, and have been waiting for another cd to come out. This is their worst effort in my opinion. The lyrics seem choppy and don't flow with the usual Metallica metal style. Some of Kirks guitar work is real heavy, and would be worth listening to without the lyrics. This cd could put Metallica down for the count, or perhaps it should put them down with this effort."
2,What happened...?,"This album is both great and dissapointing at the same time.Classic Metallica song writing, with strong vocals and great lyrics. The album, however suffers from terrible, sub-standard production values. What happened???? After 4 or 5 tracks the snare drum becomes very annoying making the music difficult to listen to. This same team, Metallica and Bob Rock, have produced great albums and set the tone with the production values on the ""Black"" album and every Metallica recording since. This one sounds like a demo and not a polished Metallica recording.Sorry to say but the production is just not there and if that was thier intent, what a bad decision that was! Someone should have double check this recording before letting it go to press."
2,where are the solos?,"this cd is ok. st anger and invisible kid have some cool parts, but what i wanna know is, where did the solos go? they've got kirk hammet, and excellent soloist, and there is not one solo on the entire album. i am honestly disappointed. this version of metallica sounds nothing like the metallica of old, or even the stuff from load and reload, its like a totally new band, and thats not really a good thing."
3,"Trying to get back to hardcore, Forgot how.","I love Metallica, and no one puts on a better show. I had such high hopes with this album. I listened to it from beginning to end, and not one song grabbed my attention. It seems like they were trying to get back to old school metal, which fans have been begging for, but they just couldn't pull it off. They must of forgot how they felt when they wrote those songs years ago. I mean if your a fan your going to buy the album and there is a DVD that I can't wait to check out, but I was really disappointed. Looks like it was thrown together in a month, so they would have something for tour. Maybe the DVD will show that. Save your Money, and see them live, then you won't be dissappointed except when they sing these songs."
2,Irrelevant noise,"Ok, when I first heard Metallica (in 1985, on KNAC in L.A.) it was a life-altering experience. It was music that turned heads (ears?) It was ground-breaking, angry-yet-beautiful, well-crafted music that you could listen to over and over again - the definition of a true classic. St. Anger is not ground-breaking in any way whatsoever. It's a rehash of much of the same thing that's been done over the last 15 or 20 years, only not as good. I agree with the other reviewers about the lyrics not being up to par, and James' voice coming close to breaking at different points. And Lars' snare, that metallic ringing might have been a great effect for one song, but by the fourth or fifth one, it's annoying..."
4,Thank God it's not that insipid boogie rock stuff !!!,"Metallica have done the ""back to basics"" approach that many bands take after releasing a few bland albums. The sound is really loud and very distinct. As one reviewer mentioned, upon first listen the songs sound too similiar. Probably the first thing that sticks out is the numerous time changes that occur within the context of individual songs. Very reminiscient of Master and Justice in that respect. The lyrics seem simple at times, even recycling lyrics from old albums (is this a KMFDM album?) The title track says ""F*** it all and no regrets"" then mentions ""Hit the lights"" coming from [Damage Inc.] and [Hit The Lights] respectively. Overall, St. Anger is a much welcomed step in the right direction. It's great to hear Metallica doing thrash/speed metal, and not that insufferable ""boogie rock"" that made the last few albums sound like Lynyrd Skynyrd on steroids.Is it a classic? No. Is it a good album? Indeed."
3,St. [Drivel],"My gosh, What is with all of the bell ringing and oil drum banging? Does Lars think he is in Stomp! James's lyrics are trite and over blown. The first three tracks are total [drivel]. The tail end of the album 5(the best of the bunch)-11 start to rock HARD. Definitely reminisent of Justice and the machine gun guitar cruching. It seem like they forced it on this album. BTW Bob rock plays bass on the recording not Trujjillo. Too bad the first half of the cd is unlistenable"
1,This must be some sort of joke....right??,"I can't believe this...some jokesters have recorded a bunch of horrible ""music"" and put their phony CDs into packages that say ""Metallica"". God, I hope these people get sued and thrown in jail and are never heard from again. Hopefully everyone who bought this crap will get their money back...it is just awful. It sounds like it was recorded thirty years ago down in some kid's basement using a Mr. Microphone. What a bunch of losers! I can't wait until the new album comes out from the real Metallica, it should be great. They owe it to their fans after waiting so many years."
1,"Metallica Used to Rock, but Now...","Sure, Metallica was a good band back in the late eighties and early nineties. But ever since their tiff with Napster and their propsed break up in 2000, the news that they would be coming back made me astonished. I was actually looking forward to ""St. Anger,"" which I heard was going to be a heavy, actually the heaviest, Metallica album ever. But Metallica's new album fails to deliver the good of the early nineties. Where's the melodic tranquility and furious guitar thrashing of ""Enter Sandman?"" Where's the vocal experience of ""Turn the Page?"" The title track happens to sound very unprofessional, making it seem as if they're trying to be hard and heavy. They're Metallica- They don't need to try! Maybe their next one will be better. For now, I'll just listen to ""Metallica"" until then."
2,something something something is needed,"I'm a huge metallica fan and have six cd's which i all like except for this one. Don't waste your money on this cd although the free DVD is good, but the music is horrible. Lars Ulrich has the most annoying drums that ruin the music and you can't even hear Trujillo play his bass. Hetfeild's singing is the worst in his career. There are no solo's at all and they often repeat their lyrics especially in the St. Anger song where they repeat it two annoying times. This band needs help especially in the no solo part. Metallica has turned themselves into just a regular rock band, not the heaviest and one of the best rock bands."
2,what happened?,"What hapened to the great Metallica??? this cd is okay, but it's not the Metallica I know. I was shocked to see that there is absolutely NO SOLOS. Cmon! What is Lars drumming on? It sounds like trash cans, that sound can get really annoying fast.Some songs are good, but I know Ispeak for every other Metallica fan when I say their old stuff is ALOT BETTER."
1,Metallica is NOT back!!,"Save your money people. Metallica's last great album was Black, and that it shall remain. Metallica sounds here , worse than they would in a garage, with no one listening. This album is all drums, no musical sound from Hetfield (Other than muttering), and no guitars!! It's just not the Metallica we (born in the 70s folk) are used to listening. I love the old Metallica, and I'm not willing to settle for less. So, if you feel the same way, buy the new Helloween album or listen to some of the new German heavy metal. They haven't lost their touch there."
1,Amazingly Bad!!,"This latest effort from one of metal's heavyweights sounds as if each member wrote and recorded their own material and then tried to figure out how best to patch it all together. If this band is ""evolving"", then they've evolved past my level of interest. Here's one long-time fan that is very, very disapointed. Save your money and if you absolutely need this CD to complete your collection or just to satisfy your curiosity, then go to any used CD shop. I unloaded my copy and only got a couple $$ because the shop already had lots of used copies in stock."
3,"Times change, unfortunately, and so does music","It seems that Metallica changes with every album they release, and their latest album is no exception. St. Anger is definetly a hard rocking album but it doesn't have the musical diversity that their previous albums had. People complained that Kirk Hammett had watered down his solos, so they have done away with solos completely. People wanted the longer epic songs back, well we certainly got longer songs again but they are more repetitive than epic. They're all lighting fast, all loud, all full of anger, and all have the same sound. By the way, what happened to ballads? This is certainly a signifigant change but will it hold up to all their fans?"
3,"Not horrible, yet disappointing for it being Metallica","This CD is like no other Metallica CD ever recorded. Because the band members chose not to be so dictative in what the music sounded like, it seems as though they put random riffs together on top of a loose-sounding snare that does not take the shape of a song. Up until the black album, Metallica had structured, melodic, harmonic, and heavy music. Even with the addition of the black album and the Load albums, Metallica still released music that was enjoyable enough to zone out of life for. This CD does have some heavy riffs and cool beats, yet there are only a few out of each song. I find myself searching through each song, trying to find parts I like. Buy it if you are a faithful Metallica fan like I am, but if you've never bought a Metallica CD before, I suggest you use your money to buy a Metallica classic such as ""...And Justice For All."""
1,A bold move from the baddest band around,"From a fan of Metallica's 'Kill em all' through 'black album' era, let me say that this album is horrible. The lack of guitar solos is disgusting, and the forced sounding lyrics backed by low tuned crappy guitar is even worse. However, one has to respect the bold move of putting out a something completely different than any of metallica's previous albums. By doing what they wanted to do and not catering to the expectations of everyone else, i have to give props to metallica, although I am hoping for something better next time."
1,by far Metallica's worst,Nothing to say about Selloutica's latest album besides that everything about it is absolutely horrible. Do yourself a big favor and buy one of their great albums of the 80's like Master Of Puppets or Ride The Lightning. Even Load and Reload are much better than this piece of crap.
1,TOO MANY PEOPLE LIKE THIS CD :(,I'm sick of the positive reviews for St Anger. Your lying and you know it. The CD is a joke. Like your positive review of it. Stop the nonsense and jump on the Metallica bashing band wagon. It's fun !
1,Worst Album Yet!!!!,If you thought the RELOAD and LOAD albums were bad. Think again. This has to be the worst Metallica album I have ever heard. Not only does Kirk Hammet loose complexity in his riffs he also loose the high treble cutting edge guitar signature sound that he created. On top of that Lars Ulrich sounds like he is playing Bongo Drums. Can you say SELL OUT? Metallica is selling out to those other non solo performing bands to make the almighty dollar.
1,HUGE let down ! sux!,I hope they do better with there next cd that comes out! there was only 1 good song ! ST anger and that was it!
1,"Let's Face it, They are Done","I remember when I was about 10 and I heard Master of Puppets. That album was amazing. I fully converted from hip hop to metal. After this, I got into Maiden, Priest, Saxon and many many other great metal bands. After I heard Load, I knew Metallica was done. THis album just solidifies that. When Metallica was a good band, they used to actually call themselves ""metal"" and compare themselves to Maiden, Priest and Sabbath. Now they stay away from calling themselves metal and compare themselves to Audioslave and Red Hot Chili Peppers. If that isn't sell out, then I don't know what is. I know bands try to make their music more accessible to people (Priest did this with Turbo and Saxon did this with Denim and Leather), but this is just ridiculous. Don't get this album!"
1,AWFUL!,"This album was suposed to be the return of the old metallica. However, when I listen to the old songs such as ""battery"" or ""master of puppets"" I nearly blow my head trying to figure out what went wrong.. Not a single solo in the entire album! Kirk Hammit is the master of solo it's what made metallica METALLICA! This album came as a huge dissapointment. I could honestly care less what happens to it. I hope metallica writes a humble apology. It's awful! The songs droan on and on and hetfields voice is somewhat like a pre-pubecent boy. DO NOT even consider this album. It's nothing like the metallica you used to know."
1,This album gave me a headache,This a quick and to the point review there are 11 songs on the cd over 75 minutes of noise oh sorry I mean music. This album truly was not worth the long wait it sounded more like load than anything (I thought was supposed to be the sound of the old days) Ha that will never happen. What happened to Kirk did they forget to plug him in? They should have just called this one RE-RELOAD very disappionting release never again PS I haven't even checked out the dvd yet.
3,Somewhat Disappointed,The loss of Jason Newsted is apparent on their latest work. Almost every track sounds similar. I would have to say that this is their worst work to date.
4,Metallica STill Rocks,"Metallica's 8th studio album is everything you would expect from the band and more. With this CD you not only get the CD with 11 new songs, but also a bonus DVD with live performances of the songs. The CD is very hard rock and once again proves how Metallica will forever ""rock"" in the eyes of thier fans. St. Anger the CD's title track for me has been the best song so far. This CD will redefine Metallica but will never erase the image of the hard rockers."
1,I waited years for this????,"If you are a fan of metallica yolu will not like this cd, the lyrics are pointless, the guitar solos are non exisitant where the hell was kirk when they made this album. Every song starts out the same. But what this album really lacks is melody, thats what the human ear needs to enojoy a sound and this album does not. Stick to there old stuff. So disappointing."
1,A big disapointment!,"Before this cd came out, I heard rumors that this was to be heavy and sound like old metallica.What a load of crap that was.This album just comes to show what Metallica has lowered themselves to:Sellouts who'll do anything to make a buck. I suggest if you want real Metallica, stick with Kill 'em all -metallica(black album) and stop there.Metallica is dead as far as I'm concerned and has lowered themselves to the likes of awful bands(not metal) like Limp Bizkit,Linkin Park,Staind,Godsmack,etc.This album is dreadful and should be avoided at all costs!If you want real metal of the present, check put System Has Failed by Megadeth."
1,"Comprehensive, Song-by-song Reveiw","If anyone of you are thinking about buying this album maybe this review will help you out.1. Frantic - sucks2. St. Anger - sucks3. Some Kind Of Monster - sucks4. Dirty Window - sucks5. Invisible Kid - sucks6. My World - sucks7. Shoot Me Again - sucks8. Sweet Amber - sucks9. Unnamed Feeling - sucks10. Purify - sucks11. All Within My Hands - sucksMetallica have sold out a long time ago, they will never put anything more out worth listening to, they have betrayed their own fans, and this album shows that they got what they deserve, it's that painful to listen to. STOP BUYING THEIR ALBUMS!!! Do you really want to be giving these sh*ts your money? I don't. Buy any Megadeth album except Risk instead of this album, and you will be completely satisfied, and even more so knowing that your money is not going to help already rich corperate rock sellouts buy a new yacht."
1,Pop crap,"This is the gayset cd ever with this peice of s*** that is supposed to be heavy metal but in stead this is some Pop album.DEAL WITH IT.the lyrics are stupid (sample lyric from ""st.anger"":""I feel my world shake,like an earthquake"")!Please dont waste your time."
1,I thought this was gonna be a comeback!!!,"The last CD worth listening to was The Black Album. I'm one of the millions of original ""Kill Em All"" fans that felt Metallica sold out and I still believe that to this day. I once had purchased all of the first 6 Metallica CDs. From Kill Em All through The Black Album. Over the years they either were lost, stolen or damaged. I once again have all of those CDs thanks to P2P file-sharing! I also downloaded this CD and listened to all the tracks before burning them to CD. Good thing I did! They all hit my recycle bin after listening to this GARBAGE!!! I think the end of the road is near for the once AWESOME Metallica. But if they want to keep putting out CDs, I'll download the songs for free, listen to them and if by some freak accident they put out something decent, I'll burn it into my CD collection! That's right Lars!! I'll NEVER buy another CD of yours or anyone else for that matter!! KEEP FILE-SHARING ALIVE!!! SCREW THE RIAA!!!"
1,NOTHING BUT NU METAL GARBAGE,"They used to be metal gods, the first 4 albums are amazing.The Black album is not bad, but after this... just crap after crap.The pop metal Load/ReLoad are horrible. st anger is even worse nothing but MTV nu-metal crap with very bad production.Why don't they change the band's name to KORNICA?"
1,The Horsemen are Drawing Nearer,"Metallica alienated their core fans with the release of the Black album, and St. Anger has successfully alienated everyone else. At least they don't have to worry too much about people illegally downloading it. It is NOT a return to their older sound - that is a big lie. It's hard to write good, angry music when you spend all your time drunk in a mansion. Cliff Burton is spinning in his grave like a gyroscope."
4,Great Outing For THE Classic Metal Band,"Even without Jason Newsted, this bands still knows how to rock. Robert Trujillo does a fantastic job filling in. My only complaint would be the unspeakably long length of the songs. 6 out of 11 songs on the disc span at least 7 minutes. Other than that, ST. Anger rocks. (The Bonus DVD kicks butt to)P.S.- To anybody wondering how Im reviewing a CD that hasnt come out yet, in Akron, Ohio, a Best Buy store had a Metallica-Palooza with over 80 copies of the new CD and all their old albums and DVDs."
2,Tin cans and muddy sounds for all,"Oh how the mighty have fallen. Its sometimes sad when bands say things that make them look even dumber than before ""we went back to what we did best"" to be honest there isn't too much of anything good on this disc. They sound like a bad nu metal band that plays very fast and sloppy. James sounds like a mix between Danzig and my a*s. Sorry but save you money and get something better than this crap session. The words are a joke, the drum sound is a joke, and the guitars are a joke. If you wanna laugh then this is for you"
1,Terrible.,"This stuff is terrible. There is nothing good about this. ""St. Anger"" got overplayed. It's all old. I hate this CD. Thank god I didn't waste my money on it. My friend bootlegged it, so I burned it from him. I almost bought this---If I did, I'd be so disappointed. Skip this. Metallica [is bad] now."
4,I like it.,"I thought the Black Album was good, but disappointing in that it was an overt attempt by the the godfathers of thrash metal to become pop-stars. Load and Reload were disappointing, as if Metallica were two different bands pre-Black Album and post-Black Album. This album sounds exactly like what it is: Metallica circa 2003, remembering what thrash is, but not trying to copy their own sound from fifteen years ago. It sounds like a Metallica wearing all it's influences on it's sleeve (for those pretentious metalhead wankers that don't realize the influence of punk and hardcore on Metallica, see Garage Inc). It sounds like a Metallica more interested in being a metal band, and being Metallica, than a pop band. I give them props-it was a gutsy record to make.I agree with the guy who said this is the apology for that last few records. I won't be surprised if it is critically lauded but sells poorly."
1,Should get Zero stars,"This album is horrible. Unless you are just a die hard fan, want all their cd's, or have extra money to blow I suggest you buy something else. Metallica needs to just retire they are destroying they music and fan base with cd's like this one."
1,Its really good. (to kill yourself).,It CANT get any worst than this. Metallica (the money hunters) are back again to catch your money with gargabe again.
1,Do not waste your cash,"Many people on Amazon have already detailed exactly why this album bites the big one. To that I'll just add that I managed to suffer through the whole CD exactly once. It has now been banished from my CD player forever, and I'm hoping I can trade it for some real music.I have all of Metallica's CDs and was even listening to ""Kill 'em All"" and ""Master of Puppets"" for a few weeks before this was released, just to get into the heavier side of the band again. I should have stayed there. If you really want to know for yourself, borrow this CD from someone first. You may be one of the minority of people who actually like it, but I doubt it."
1,HORRIBLE . . . HORRIBLE . . . HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,"I can't say much that hasn't already been said. This album has no redeeming value. Terrible production, poorly written songs, and musicians that sound like they are trying too hard. Nothing came together. A complete disaster!!!"
1,Fragmented sound---a big step down for the band!,"After Load and Reload, with a follow up to the incredible mixture of sound in S&M, this band seems to be in an identity crisis. Lack of follow through in the songs, less melody and more of a ""Static X"" feeling throughout---gave me a disappointed feeling. I have been a fan of Metallica for a long time and this is the ONLY time I have ever walked away wanting something else."
2,St. Anger,I just bought the new Metallica album St. Anger (the first day it came out) and no offense to Metallica but this is not a good album at all. I am a true metallica fan to the bone but this is really not much of a cd. I have every album of theirs and this has to be the lowest on my list of cd's. All this album includes is just everybody pounding on the instruments at once. You can't tell much of a rhythum or depth to it. I am a guitar player myself and admit this is really a songwriting low for Metallica.
1,What a disaster!,Definitely an album Metallica would like to forget. The drums sounds like someone is slapping a biscuit tin and the singing is just terrible. The songs are rubbish - I got the album for free and didn't even give it away - it went straight into the bin. Garbage.
1,One star is one too many.,"Ouch! Having grown up with Metallica's music, it's a shame to see this kind of release (well, the past few releases have stunk). This is just NOT the Metallica that I have such fond memories of.It's sad that they have gone so far away from what made them good. I guess that's why we have our old CDs. We can go and listen to them while they were good and still enjoy them.Basically, if you're just getting into Metallica, start fom the beginning and experience the excellence they brought to the table for the industry and then weep with the rest of us at what they have become. Very sad, very sad indeed!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"This is not the worst album in the world. It's still extremely bad, though, and there's not a track I can enjoy except for maybe Frantic. I'm giving this 1 star because it was supposed to be so much better."
1,Harvest of sorrow !!,"It is obvious from the film ""Some Kind of Monster"" the Metallica camp has gone from making great music to over thinking every move they make. This album is horrible at best. If this is what sobriety brings, someone needs to go to the beer store and get the boys back ""off"" the wagon. What a let down and an overpriced piece of garbage. Now I know why Hetfield was crying in the movie, they let him hear this album."
1,Will make you cry.,"I am disgusted with this album, the production of it is just TERRIBLE maybe James shouldn't have gone to rehab... his songs we're better when he was drunk frankly. On some of the songs (St Anger for one) James sounds more like a country singer! Where are the guitar solos? You can't be metal without the crazy guitar solos! The drums are just terrible, they are far too loud and they sound like Lars is playing a 50 dollar drum set.There is one slight part of this that isnt a total let down though. The song some kind of monster isn't really all that bad with some nice guitar riffs, but it is still too long and feels even longer without a guitar solo and vocals the whole way through.Metallica's first 5 albums are the only ones worth listening to."
1,Metallica?,"This CD was a huge dissapointment...i can not believe that this is the band that wrote Master of Puppets and And Justice For All...there aren't even any solos. The music style is so different, they focused on being heavy, when in the past it came naturally. Overall a huge dissapointment and delay to the fans."
1,Hit the Lights...please,"I thought that there was no way Metallica could make a more contrived piece of trash,that they somehow thought that they could spoon-feed to the MTV sheep, than Load.I was wrong.I seriously doubt this will quench the thirst of what few remaining loyal fans they have from before the dark days (read: before they became addicted to money,overproduction, and apparantly Pro-Tools). I have James 'sweaty' Hetfield armband from a black album tour show I still save out of some sort of twisted sense of nostalgia, but I wouldn't even download this steaming tower of [garbage] for FREE off Napster. No wonder they are out to bring Justice for All to free music traders, they don't want anyone to sneak an ear piercing listen before they cough up thier [money]Its a sad, sad moment, but not one that any long time Metallica fiend is probably really surprized by. Oh well, Hit the Lights, this ones dead."
2,Worse sounding cd ever!,"Being a big metallica fan i couldn't wait for this cd to finally come out. What a big disappointment. If they were going for how a band sounds playing in a garage, they hit it right on the head. The drums sound horrible. The cymbals don't sound crisp or bright, the snare is even worse, and the bass has no bottom end. The bass guitar is weak. The guitars sound flat and have little crunch. I can't believe anybody can stand the ways this cd sounds. As far the song writing is concerned it is pretty good. Thats the only reason it gets 2 stars. If the production was alot better and some more thought was put in this we might be talking about this being there best since justice for all. After taking a year to do this cd it sounds like it took a week. If metallica continue to do their cds like this i will never buy another one."
2,I know music,"To sum it all up, hard drums and guitars, but james sounds awful. His lyrics are stupid to the point where they are funny, and basically the best part of the cd is the first couple of seconds at the beginning of each song where there is no vocals. Worst cd they have put out by far"
1,F@#$ This!!,"What has happened to this once great band! I guess the influence of the media, and what is popular at the time has turned these great musicians into sell out wannabe's. If your thinking of buying this album ....DON'T!!! All it is,is a big let down. Not a single guitar solo on the whole thing! This album has staind the world of heavy metal forever!"
1,WHAT HAPPENED TO METALLICA???????????????????????????,"No Joke, this is one of the worst albums EVER!!!!!!!!! I just cannot believe my ears. This is the same band that put out ""whiplash"" ""Battery"" ""Master of Puppets"" and ""One"" ? just to name a few. I am so disgusted. I wish I didn't even have to give this one star. You guys are killing me. Horrible....."
1,A bonus cd included and its still NO BLODDY GOOD,"This band is FU KED,their so bad that i hear metallica songs now being played on the FOX and TTFM."
1,Beat nuts.,"In a word- uninspired. This album contains some of the worst songwriting I've heard in a long time from any metal band. There is no soul to any of the music, the drums are lame, the riffs are watered down, basically no soloing (so what exactly did Kirk Hammet even DO for this release?), and campy lyrics. Why was this album even produced? We all know Metallica doesn't need the money. My guess would be that this aging outfit still needs to feel the warmth of the spotlight.I can't blame Metallica for not being able to write good music anymore. For nearly 10 years they were hands-down the best metal band in the world, and produced 10-or-so albums that were golden, original, and genre-defining. No band can write cutting-edge material forever, and Metallica was doing it well for over 15 years.Do yourself a favor and don't buy this album. It's over, Metallica. And if you're a true metalhead, check out some of the newer bands (In Flames, Soilwork). Metal is not dead, just Metallica."
5,What the..................!?!?!?,"The divided response to this CD must be expected. Never has a group been so scrutinized since Led Zeppelin, or as important. St. Anger is a great piece of work. Gone are all cliches, this baby is original. Perhaps it is here where some find it difficult....no ..., no filler, just raw metal. It cannot be compared to their earlier work, or to other bands...nor should it be. Thanks boys for wading through all of the ... and putting out a true classic!"
1,STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Metallica sold out.................... St Anger is one of the dumbest songs ever. Plus there new bass player sounds like a old lady playing the tuba. And james hetfiled (forgot how to spell is name)sounds like a dying cat.If you want metallica.... Pick of Master of puppets!!!!!!
5,Return to Heaviness,"St. Anger is a massive return to heaviness. Gone are the ballads, and radio friendly songs. In their place: 11 songs that total around 70 minutes of music. This album is totally killer. However, it is not the Metallica from the old days. This is Metallica 2003 not Metallica 1986, and the music reflects that. This is Metallica at their best: Hard, Heavy, and Brutal."
1,WORSE THAN LOAD!,"I can't believe how far Hetfield has gone to prove just how bad he can make this album sound, knowing people will STILL buy it. What a shame, Metallica could've been rock legends, but now they're nothing. Unlike their very early records, this has no heart to it at all. Please people, don't buy something just because its Metallica, buy something because its actually good!"
1,"Listening Will Make You ""Angry"" Because it [is not good]!","My wife and I wanted to like this cd so much, but we just can't. We've waited all this time for something new from Metallica and what we get sounds like any mediocre heavy metal band. We got this Cd the day it was available, listened to most of it but it got so frustrating, we only listened to a few seconds of the last few songs. We havn't even considered listening to it since (it's been about 3 or 4 weeks). We don't think we want to see them in concert anymore because they will probably do songs from this cd. This is coming from two people who can even find something we like in S&M, Load and Reload."
4,Let it grow on you,"This album takes a little getting used to. Once it clicks, however, it's awesome and very powerful. St. Anger (track 2) is as hard and aggressive as Master of Puppets (song) and it has a composition resembling (And justice for all...(the song)). Frantic, obviously influenced by Hetfield's new sobriety is a great starter for this album.The usual Kirk Hammett guitar solos are missing, and amen to that. This album has a deep, hard, almost disturbing intensity. Noted is Lars' very tight snare drum throughout the album that is infectious throughout the album.Thumbs up guys!John Schiefer"
1,Terrible!,"I'd have to say that it's not as bad as their last two albums, which were a total waste. They talk about modernizing their sound, but I want the old Metallica back. And what was the deal with no guitar solos on this album? This was a total waste of money and I wish I hadn't have bought it."
1,Disappointed,"This isn't Metallica as we know it. This album appears to be stylistically so disjointed from is predecessors that I would not have recognized it to be from the same band.I guess that it comes down to a matter of taste, so listen to this album before you buy it.No matter what your opinion is, Metallica just recently proved that it is still capable of performing as I witnessed at the LA Coliseum on the Summer Sanitarium tour.Let's hope their next album is better than this one!"
2,Why Lars? Why?,"Having been a big Metallica fan for years, I was truely expecting that St. Anger would live up to all of its hype and be the true return-to-roots we've all dreamed of. Unfortuneatly, as with Load and Reload, Metallica has continued to experminent with their sounds and musical style. St. Anger is that experiment gone horribly wrong. The audio quality is terrible. Not even on par with an average video cassette, the CD is what I would call ""Low-Fi"". The singing style is more like that of Linkin Park and Korn. That's not a good thing. Gone are the ""cool"" solos from previous albums, as are any and all concepts of harmony. Probably the worst thing about the album is the sound of the drums. Lars sounds like he's banging on a trashcan lid. With all of the money he has, you would think he could have spent ...[$5] on a Remo dampener, or at least taped a sock to the drum head. Do yourselves a favor and save your money for something else."
1,With this production..I'd be angry too...,Well...don't get me wrong..Metallica had accomplished a lot in their careers. This album as a whole...STINKS. Some songs could be a lot better if the production wasn't so bad. The snare drum rings like a coffee can hit with a lead pipe..some songs where the drums and bass just play..the bass is barely a rumble...and when Lars and James come in..the whole mix drops out..very poorly produced by someone who is(was)well respected in the recording world..Bob Rock. Well..maybe they did go back to the Ride the Lightning days..with a bass guitar that is nonexistent.
1,THIS ALBUM IS HORRIBLE!!,"I first heard of Metallica in high school when they were an unknown garage band. I fell in love with their original sound and have been a dedicated fan since then. I was excited to hear they had a new album out I couldn't wait to hear it. To my shock and horror this was the worst album I have ever heard! It doesn't even sound like Metallica! What happened? Personally I think they chickened out of being unique and are trying to be like someone they are not.I wouldn't waste my money on it if I were you, trust me it's not worth it."
3,Not exactly the old quality Metallica!!,"This album is quite unique for Metallica. However I was hoping for something better. Every song seems to sound the same, it definately did not have the same effect on me as when I listened to Ride the Lightning for the 1st time. I miss seek & destroy, creeping death, trapped under ice, master of puppets, battery,breadfan, for whom the bell tolls , . . . . I guess things will never be the same. Oh well, compare Led Zeppelin I to In through the out door. At least they're still around and making music. This is the only Cd i've bought in 3 years, they will definately capitalize on on this just because they're Metallica!!"
1,Why I think Metallica should kick it back to there roots...,"I have just listened to every track on the St. Anger album, and quite frankly, with the exception of The Unnamed Feeling which is mediocre at best. I have confirmed that this album is complete and utter filth; it was a waste of a good CD. I mean seriously, Reloaded was a better album and that is not saying much. If Cliff heard this album he would be spinning in his grave.Moving right along, I would much rather listen to Kill 'Em All while having a knife dug into my spleen then listen to the St. Anger album straight thru. With all this said, for anyone with half a heart, do not purchase this wanna-be Reloaded rehash and go purchase any of there albums prior to Loaded."
1,Run Away...,"I bought this album with great expectation. In this day of 'Dumb' rock Metallica has always been above this with decent writing, great playing, and a true 'lead' guitarist. This sounded like Metallica trying to sound like everybody else out there (but not as good)... Most of the songs are at least twice too long than they need to be ... All of the songs are like this (most of them averaging between 5:30 to 8 minutes). The album is repetative, all the same vibe, and poorly mixed (would you please turn down Lars' snare drum, egad). It is such a shame that such a good band would put out such [a bad cd]."
2,overall a piece of {junk},I'm sorry to say it but this is the end for metallica. Never have heard a band as great as metallica suddenly sink so fast. If your looking for classic metallica you wont find any of it here. The drums sound like lars is just pounding on pots and pans. And there is not a single guitar solo throught the whole cd. I personally feel sorry for those of you who've wasted your money on the summer sanitarium. Rob Trujillo should get out of this band cause hes the only one who still knows how to make good music. Dont waste your money on this piece of [junk]. If you do want to hear true metal go purchase a manowar cd or Dream Theater or best yet Black Label Society. I guantee you theres bands wont sell out like metallica did!
1,Kill 'Em All...the band I mean.,"This is by far the worst Metallica album to date. I thought Load and Reload were bad, then I got this and it makes those albums look good. :( I'm afraid its time for Metallica to retire. The ""garage"" sound this album has, added to the poor music and bad singing equal one of the worst metal/rock albums I've heard in quite a while...and I've heard a lot of them!"
1,Why?,"I'm all for bands trying something new, but this album kinda [stin]ks. I was ready for the old days of some [REALLY]ROCKIN METALLICA, and all got was this amateur MOTORHEAD sound. I guess not everybody can be OZZY, or AC/DC and keep making good songs their whole career. I think if METALLICA makes their next album like this one it could be the end of METALLICA. I hope not because I really need METALLICA back."
1,Metallica: Worst Album EVER,"As several other people have stated - the only reason I gave this album 1 star is because there was no ""zero star"" option. I have never been more disappointed in an album in my life as I am with this one. Metallica said that they were going back to their roots.....unfortunately they only did this 10 seconds at a time. The songs change pace and skip around so much that you can't keep up with them. James sounds like he is singing the whole album in his ""Nothing Else Matters Voice"" instead of his ""Creeping Death"" voice. If this is the kind of music that Metallica is going to produce I think they should just call it quits. I, for one, have retired as a Metallica fan."
1,Save your money for the new Maiden...,"Pomp and Circumstance - 10; Substance - ZERO! Nice package, good ""bonus DVD"" idea... but the music (and that's what REALLY matters yet) is boring and miserable... Since they've already played the ""Covers-album"" and the ""Group-and-orchestra"" tricks, and the ""Unplugged"" is old news, Metallica should start putting ""Best Of's"" out... looks like their best is WAY behind them :(((("
1,Is Lars sponsored By Tupperware???,"OK, Being a long time fan of Metallica since Kill `em All, I Grew up with them, I play all their songs on guitar, Ive Seen them in concert, Ive even broken down the songs in my head because of listening to them so much. I am one who expects change, NO band can sound the same forever, You have to change your style, its called progression! But what in the hell is this album? It sounds like Lars Ulrich uses drums that are sponsored by TupperWare! The ENTIRE album seems like they made it overnight....St. Anger is already played out on the radio, and i have to change it because its so annoying already, And trust me....Thats not good, For any band! Metallica, You [stink] now, its offical, its over. Go home to your families, and relax and retire. You shoulda left it alone after orchestating everything, But no..You tried pulling that last album out of your ..., and to be honest, I think thats actually where you got it from. Im now offically ashamed of you"
2,Not what I expected,"Metallica. You say that name and what do you think of? You think of the insane Metallica that I used to know who played their hearts out. Where are the insanely good Kirk solos. A Metallica song without a solo is no song at all. Was that really James singing. Wow. It sounded like some punk band lead singer who cries like a baby. The only reason I was nice enough to give this c.d two stars is because the songs where heavy. That is one thing that stayed the same. Don't get me wrong. I am in love with the old Metallica. The awesome riffs, the great lyrics, insane solos. I love them. Even if they redid their old stuff it would have been better then this ... I think the Metallica bus has run out of gas. They should hang it up with the new stuff and bring back the past. My advice to you, buy the c.d if you like heavy stuff. If you love the old Metallica don't expect the same quality."
2,Won't be duped again.,"First, I am a huge Metallica fan and anxiously awaited the release of St.Anger. Unfortunately, the album is pretty much worthless. Sure, they still have their chops, but there isn't a real song on the entire freaking album! It's all just a kind of endless, chaotic, rhythmic loop. No wonder people want free downloads. My suggestion is that for anyone interested in well-crafted metal, purchase Marilyn Manson's latest. Intense, passionate, worth every penny."
1,What Happened???????????,"What Happened!!!!!!!!?????????Metallica has always been my favorite band. If they can't make a cd like their older stuff then just retire our atleast go on more tours. They have plenty of money. I'm not going to bash metallica like other ppl would cuz i luv them to much but one word of edvice, for all of those ppl tryn to say this cd is really metallica don't bother u punk pussies. LISTEN TO REAL CLASSIC METAL!!!!!!"
1,Metallica to Rocktalllica,"This album is the biggest disapointment EVER. What happened? Did Metallica all the sudden start sucking? YES.In this album, James sounds like a country singer when he sings slow and the lyrics have the intellect of a toddler. When I first heard a song from this album, I thought that they were going back to their garage days. Man, was I WRONG. I made the mistake of buying this album. Please, don't make the same mistake that I did. Spend that money on a better album like ""Vulgar Display of Power"" by Pantera. Usually, Metallica fans love Pantera."
3,St. Angry Metallica fans!!!,"I'm tired of reading reviews of some people bashing metallica about, no solos, bad vocals, poor (raw) production, and songs way too long. Metallica may have lost their spark long time ago but they have done some great albums that they can afford to messup. Metallica as a group are bunch of open minded musicians who love to try new things,unlike Slayer. I belive no matter how bad this album is,there are 3 good songs in there.That's why they get 3 stars. Everyone messes up or elese you won't learn and grow. To all the St. Anger bashers ,take it easy. Metallica can fart in a jar ,it would still sell becasue they have done so much for the scene."
1,awful,"I wanted to give it awhile to settle in to see what my long term opinion would be, thus the wait on the review. I bought this thing the day it came out and was looking forward to a real rockin' album that was promised to be much better than the sub-par Load/Reload.The first time I listened to it I hated it. It's disjointed and might as well be jazz.Then I watched the DVD and took the music for what it's worth: a jam session in its rawest form. Just the guys having fun.Later and now, I hate it again. The drum reverb is impossible to get past, Kirk's solos are absent and Hetfield's singing is just awful. Sorry, guys.I'll probably never listen to it again. Probably watch the video, but just pretend it's a practice session I'm sitting in on and that James has a sore throat and Kirk has a broken arm and the acoustics are just bad that day for drums.Still waiting to see what Trujillo can do. Loved him in Suicidal!"
5,Welcome back Metallica!!!,"Metallica's greatest album? NO! However, St. Anger is a good album nevertheless. Let's give them more credit. Stop trashing them please. I'm tired of these so-called Metallica fans wanting the band to sound the same has they were in the 80s. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen, because we're not in the 80s. The band has to keep with the time in order to stay alive.I'm a die-hard Metallica fan, always will be, I like the 80s, 90s, and 00s Metallica. If you think about it, every Metallica album had something different. St. Anger is no different. The first three songs are great. The drums are in need of getting use to and the production could have been better. However, I enjoyed this CD, plus you get to see them play the songs live in the DVD. If you want something heavier, try Slayer."
2,"Good record, but not the band at their best.","I was looking forward to St. Anger for a really long time. I have to say it didn't meet my expectations all the way, but somewhat satisfied them. Songs like ""Frantic"", ""St. Anger"", ""Some Kind of Monster"", ""Invisible Kid"", ""Shoot Me Again"", and ""Unnamed Feeling"" are the best of the bunch in my opinion. But alot of the songs had parts to them that were quite necessary. For example, ""Shoot me Again"", after the chorus Hetfield keeps screaming ""Shoot me Again, Shoot me again, c'mon, Shoot me again!"". That part did not fit in the song whatsoever and it almost seemed like they added it to make the song heavier, other songs suffer the same fate as well. Overall though, St. Anger is a decent album, worth buying if you're a MetallicA fan or hard rock fan. It's definitely a lot better than the trash entitled ""Re-Load""."
1,Metallica returns to their roots,"For the old school Metallica fans that thought Metallica sold out to mainstream audiences with the Black album, Load, and Re-Load, this album will probably be a welcome return to their original style. For fans such as myself who started listening to Metallica when they started singing instead of screaming, this album will be a big dissapointment. I looked foreward to it, but didn't have high hopes for it because of everything that has gone on in the Metallica camp since Re-Load was released. The single St. Anger is OK, but the rest of the album is best left to those who feel that louder is better. Personally, I am not one of those people. If Metallica is chosing to go back to their roots, then I thank them for the three great mid 90's albums and wish them well as I will not be buying any more of their material."
4,Very impressive,"I've been a long time fan of Metallica, and thought this album is good mixture of the ""Ride the Lightning"" and ""Load/Re-Load"" albums. What really impressed me was the fact that the whole album was recorded live in-studio and not tracked and mixed by the producer. This really shows how talented these guys are. The lo-fi effect is great and really lays out the fact that it was recorded live in-studio. It has taken me a while to get used to but in all, this is are good album and shows us what's to come from them in the future. Hopefully they go back to the ""Master of Puppets"" type music and away from the pop/rock mainstream music that the ""Black"" album was."
1,Time for a Metallica funeral!,"It is sad to say that I actually got my hopes up on this release. Review after review declared Metallica was back and with a hard album. Hard to listen to! This album is a virus that should be contained and not allowed to spread! Hetfield maybe sober, but knowing I spent $... on this album has made me hit the bottle! No solos, a tin can sounding drum kit and poor production have all come together to carve out Metallica's head stone. It's time for Lars to play the funeral drum as this once metal giant is finally slain and laid to rest. I'm glad Newsted was able to get off this sinking ship before drowning with the rest. And smart enough to not throw them a life preserver! Just like Jason did, it's time to let it go! Our Metallica is never coming back."
1,WHERE IS METALLICA?,"James' lyrics [are not good], plain and simpleGuitar is alrightDrums are so/soThere is no song that grabs you, and keeps hold. There is no song that even pinches you. The lyrics mean nothing, repeating words over and over do not constitute a song."
1,Sad but True,"Only one bit of advice I can give you...save your money you are thinking of spending on St. Anguish and spend it on Anthrax - We've Come For You All. This is THE most un-appealing Metallica album I've heard, bar none. Seems they need to take a few notes from the new Anthrax album and see just how far it is they've been left behind."
1,OMG I CANT BELEIVE IT!,"metallica gone sour. i hate this album as if it were satan himself. im aware that metallica tried 2 go nu-metal, but this is rediculous! Ive been a metallica fan since as long as i can remember and one of the main reasons was how they could fit so many solos in there albums and still have it sound awesome! They have NO solos in the whole album, and wtf r they tryin 2 do with the vocals?!? they're goin godsmack. i luv godsmack but seriously, metallicas classic, or at least used 2 be. theyve disgraced themselves. i hope they go back. the nu bassist, jason, has ALOT more energy, but he sounds sumwut akin 2 a dying cat. if u plan on buying a metalica cd THIS IS NOT FOR U. go get ride the lightning or ...and justice for all. if any1 knows how i could get a hold of metallica, tell me please cuz i need 2 email em and talk em out of it lol. my email is rob_zombie_man777@hotmail.com"
5,Metallica,"After years of ""yo, what up with 'Tallica"", the band has reformed. And when I say ""reformed"", I mean ""reformed"". Hetfield came out of rehab more inspired than ever before, and pretty much wrote the album ""St. Anger"". The rest of the band was quite fueled as well, so they pooled their efforts and made their heaviest and most personal album to date. THIS is a metal landmark. Their lyrics deal with Hetfield's inner struggle, and the music takes elements from all their past albums and blends them all together fantastically. The only reasons to dislike the album are that the production is poor, there are no solos, and it sounds a bit like SoaD, and poor reason those are. Who can deny that the musicianship is spectacular? Who can deny that the whole album is filled with emotion? Are these not blessings? Honestly, folks. This is their best album in over ten years. They deserve some recognition, dag nabbit!"
1,Ouch...,Every since the Black Album theyve been dying but... ugh. Haha. Frantic isnt so bad. But youre getting like 11 other songs that suck along with it. Its definetly not worth your money. Go buy Iron Maiden - Dance Of Death. Then people wont make fun of you for owning this.
1,wtf happened,"Metallica has finally reached KISS status (you know, a band that's too old to play good music anymore). Worst cd ever, and they sued Napster. Don't support them anymore."
1,Bummer,"This album sounds like crap. 2 OK songs. It sounds like a group of teenagers pounding on garbage cans. if you like that, thats good for you, but if you are a fan of the old stuff (puppets, justice, lightning) dont get this."
1,Garbage days revisted,"This cd is heavy, fast and the sound is incredible but there is no sense of a song. It sounds like a bunch of talented kids in their garage trying to find their sound. They don't sound anything like a professional band at all. They should have incorporated these cool sound ideas into their songs or at least tried to write a song together before they released this ... metal. I'm very open to new sounds and ideas but there is no quality sound here only quantity. Don't buy this cd! Wait until they get it together and play something worth buying. These guys have balls for putting out this [stuff]. ..."
2,a little is enough,"Sounds more like an open jam session of muddied ramblings.Very little structure in the songs to keep you interested andit seems they are all playing the same note as loud as they can.Kind of a more punk sound which is okay is small doses (i.e Frantic is good, St. Anger is listenable).Lars is busy but the bass is again burried and invisible, Jamesdoesen't sing very much opting to play a muddy riff to death, poor Kirk has NO space to do anything remotely interesting or talented. I am bummed Metallica Nation. One long 75 minute din. Makes me miss Load and Reload. Yikes!"
5,Kick... CD,"This album is probably one of there best yet!!! It's definately there heaviest since Master of Puppets. Hetfields lyrics are awsome and I really am beginning to love Hetfields new way of singing it takes a bit of getting used to though. Getting Robert is probably one of the best moves this band has ever made. He really adds to the sound and is really good. The only let down is the lack of solos. Kirk really let us down on this one not to say he still doesn't kick..., its just that I really miss the solos. Overall this album kicks... with its heavy fast guitar and bass playing to Lars's new kick.... drumming. I would encourage you to buy it."
4,Best Metallica album since Master of Puppets,This is the best album they have had for a long time. I felt the lyrical eliment lacks somewhat (But I expect alot out of james) but the musicical portion is superb!! Anything is better than Newsted.
4,"Different, but interesting","If you're looking for another Master of Puppets, this isn't it. A lot of old-school Metallica die-hards are going to hate it, because it sounds nothing like those albums. On the other hand, it doesn't sound like the post-Black album discs, either. It's very raw and agressive, and the production is much more WYSIWYG -- not a lot of reverb or effects on the vocals -- very upfront and in your face. No big guitar solos or harmonies, either. If you've seen or heard the first track, St. Anger, you have a good idea of what the album sounds like. But, kudos to Metallica for trying something a little different. If you're looking for an angrier Metallica, this may be your cup o' tea."
2,Appalling sound mix job,"I won't enter into reviewing the music itself; after all, it's an entirely subjective topic. Suffice to say that it's as metal, plain, and simple as always, with the notable exception of Bob Rock at the bass, which is of course a step down. My review is motivated by the truly appalling sound mix job in this CD. As I imported the CD into iTunes and started listening to it, I went ""wow, this sounds really bad--I must have selected a high loss format,"" or ""perhaps the CD is 'copy protected'"" (as some labels are so fond of doing in Europe). So I inserted and listened to the CD itself... and it was still just as bad. Sounds like a make-shift studio (paint can for snare drum and all). I bet I can do a better job using GarageBand on my $2,000 computer."
2,Poor Metallica....,"I still call myself a Metallica fan, not a fairweather fan. I bought all their albums, didn't download them from napster. But, I have to say, this album flat out sucks. It makes Re-Load sound good, and that's saying something. When I first heard it, I hoped that stupid drum of Lars' that sounds like he's banging on a pot would only be for one song... nope. The whole album. They are so surrounded by money-hungry yes-men that just wanted them to get SOMETHING on the market so they can start raking in the cash. It makes me mad because I know they are still capable of so much better. It also makes me mad because their next album could be a spoken-word album titled ""Political discussion with Lars, comic book discussion with Kirk, and a recorded drunken slurring from James"" and I'm such a Metallica fan that I'd still go buy it. Hopefully Rick Rubin will help get them back on track. It's only been 16 years since their last good original studio album!"
2,To Metallica Fans,Ok we all know how bad this album is. But we might not have to listen to another bad album like this from Metallica. They're putting back the solos and the drums won't be sounding like trash cans anymore on their next album. Maybe Metallica is finally going back to their old metal roots. Oh God please let this be true. Now as far as this album goes yeah it's pretty bad. But everyone has already said everything that I might say about how horrible this album is. But I give them credit for two songs. The Unamed feeling and St. Anger are pretty heavy tracks. Probably the best and hardest songs off this album. In a way those songs kinda have some elements of their old stuff. I'm not saying those songs are like Master of Puppets or One but hey I like them. Anyway hopefully we can get past this album and look foward to the next Metallica album.
1,What's Wrong With People Nowadays,"I have to say i expected people to realise this was an awful album by themselves, but, come on, a grammy? i'm afraid of the music industry now, they have gone deaf, and the worst part, there are millions of people who actually think these are the cool albums of the new millenium; believe me people, if this is one of those, then i rather shoot myself in the head. I am thankful i never bought this, after re-load, i didn't expect much, and borrowed from a friend, thank god for that desition, is one of the best ones i've done in all my life, this is the worst album i've heard so far in my life, even worst than Justin's album, if you're thinking of buying this album, consider giving the money to me, i'll do better things with it."
1,- 10 stars,"awful!!!!crap!!! waste of moneythis album is worst metal album ever (not worst metallica album but worst metal album!)crap vocal, crap drum snare, ,repeative riff & lyrics no solos, no nothing, nothing to expectbetter buy any record by any other metal band like anthrax,slayer,megadeth, iron maiden, etc"
1,Metallica is gone and never ever coming back!,"First of all never listen to critics. What do they know. Look at trends in previous albums. Or preview it before you buy it. Some stores have this available. As far as this album goes. I don't have the album and I haven't even heard all the songs. I knew this album was going to suck, just by the results of load and on. When I saw the videos for st. anger and frantic, it was confermed. They suck. The first thing I noticed, is that the drums don't even sond like drums. More like bongos being hit with drum sticks. I never get tired of seeing rows of the new metallica cd in music stores, that no one is buying. Even when it's cheap or on sale. Everyone out there who things that metallica is going to come back, you go right ahead and think that. But, it's hopeless and you know it. Weither you admit it or not. They really need a zero star!"
1,Biggest piece of Tripe from them yet.,"Go buy a new non scratched CD copy of ""Ride the Lighting"", ""Master of Puppets"" or ""and justice..."" You'll be much happier then this piece of tripe."
1,TERRIBLE!,"Being a huge fan of the Master of Puppets/Justice days of Metallica, hearing this album almost brought me to tears. It is by far the worst piece Metallica has ever released. I mean, i thought Load and Reload was bad. This takes the cake. If James's voice doesn't give you a headache, then that damn echoing snare drum will! That is the most annoying thing I've ever heard! Just listen to the album and you'll know what I mean. Second of all, where did the thrashy rhythm and thundering solos go? They are nowhere to be found on St. Anger. Nothing even close to a solo. Third, The lyrics. Such classic Metallica songs as Disposable Heroes and Eye of the Beholder have had some truly deep, amazing lyrics. But now it is nothing but the mindless babble of every other band out today. I don't know what happened to Metallica, but hopefully they will learn from this mistake called St. Anger and go on to do some better things."
2,"Their best album in 10 years, but...","...it still isn't very good. And the blame for this can be placed at the feet of one person: James Hetfield. As an example listen to the opening of the title track, St. Anger. It sounds like a return to the pre-Black Album sound of Metallica, with everybody rocking at top speed. But just when you start to get into it, the tempo comes to a screeching halt, and James starts his ""singing"". Three problems:1) Singing rarely works in heavy metal2) He might be trying to sing, but that isn't what he's doing.3) The lyrics to this song, and all the others on the album, are absolutely horrible.I gave the album 2 stars because they tried to return to the sound that made them famous, but they just didn't try hard enough.Music - 4 starsSinging/lyrics - 0 starsOverall - 2 stars"
1,boring,11 tracks of the same song. ride the lighting as a 10 this is a 1. monotone all the way through.
4,St. Anger Provides a breath of Fresh Air,"Metallica did a fine job with this album. Nice and heavy with a slightly different sound, but still Metallica. This is another good addition to the collection, and it provides a breath of fresh air to the endless stream of [junk] that is being put out in the music world today. Thank you, Metallica.My only dislike about the album is that their are no Solo's by the Ripper."
3,Anger released on the world,"Well it's finally out!!!!! It's been a while since our boys put out any NEW stuff. Don't expect to hear songs like Master or Sandman on this album. This CD mainly ""talks"" about personal demons and self-imprisonment. Songs like Frantic, St. Anger and Dirty Window really show the dark and heavy side of this band, its pain and suffering. The song ""structure"" and its ""flow"" are hard to grasp if you've heard them for the first time. It takes a few tries to understand the meaning behind the heavy guitars and heart rattling drums. First impression of the album was somewhat disappointing. St. Anger doesn't come close to Ride, Master or even Justice, but you can't beat on the old idea twice. Their style of writing both music and lyrics have changed dramatically, so for the people who expect to hear another Unforgiven song, it's not happening. They might have changed in every way, but for this fan they are still MetallicA!"
5,Metallica,"Metallica since the begining with Kill Em All i was hooked.They are legends.Then came there cd Ride the Lighning featuring Fade to black, for Whom the bells toll and i was hooked.Then their Master of puppets was as good as ride the lightning featuring Sanitarium , Master of Puppets, and Battery just when I thought it couldn't get any better it did,And Justice For All ther 4th platinum selling CD,One was on this cd the epic song would engrave my mind forever.Just when I thought Metallica could not get any better The Black Album came out featuring songs like Enter Sandman,Where ever I may Roam, Uniforgiven and nothing else Matters This Cd sold 54 Million copies.Now Metallica's new CD St. Anger just ame out and I am Extreamly Pleased with it.Metallica Living Legends."
3,Bob Rock is LAZY,"Poorly produced (Bob Rock must have been really sick with food poisoning or something, BEcause i can bet $100 i can mix that album way better than that!!!) Lars needs to lay off that bouncy ... snare. I like the lyrics, the singing good but the way it was just flopped on the music with half ... mixing. I still will like it because it's METALLICA. BUT I KNOW YOU GUYS CAN MAKE A BETTER ALBUM THAN THAT (I do like it though)! Get another album out here guys and let me mix it!"
4,Old School,"Like the title says, this album is like ""old school"" Metallica. I love the music and the lyrics are real good! However, James' vocals are a little overkill at times, and the recording sounds like it was recorded in a garage. Overall, the album rocks...it is much better than I anticipated. The DVD that comes with the album is just plan awesome! You get the studio recording AND a LIVE recording with Robert Trujillo on bass! A definite buy for the hardcore Metallica fan, however people who like radio songs will definitely be disapointed."
1,Simply awful,"Detuned guitars, horrible mix, diarrayed arrangements and no Guitar solos. This is not just a lousy Metallica album...it is a lousy album period. The direction seems to be Limp Bizkit meets Slayer with disasterous results. The days of Master of Puppets are long gone.....this is by far one of the worst cd's I have ever purchased."
1,oh what a shame,"it pains me to write this being that metallica has been a long time influence and fav band, but this album is horrible. to wait 5yrs for something that sounds like a demo its sad. i understand their desire to expand and explore and i respect that but this music is not music...it sounds more like ""trying"". if they wanted to get back to their roots then it must have been some other bands roots because it sounds nothing like kill em all, or lightning. to top it off, my most fav guitarits of all time, kirk, did not do a single solo in the album and if he did i missed it which is probably worse. metallica is still musical idol and i continue to listen to their other stuff, but this is just not them and its sad."
1,St. Awful,"I dont know who the critics are attemping to fool by calling this a good CD. Once again Metallica has proven that since the Black album exposed them to the favor of the mainstream media and the bandwagon fans that this band has obviously forgotten their hardcore roots. This album is horrible, it sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom to begin with. The drums sound like over-amped pots and pans that almost completely drown out the guitars and bass. Maybe Bob Rock should have concentrated on production instead of playing bass. The songs are uninspired and James is making an attempt to ""sing"" instead of using his raw vocal style like he used to. Hopefully the once mighty Metallica will find what it was that they lost, get their [heads] back, stop giving a damn what the critics and MTV think and get back to playing the kick [tail] Metallica music that they once did many years ago. Otherwise save your money instead of wasting it on this God awful piece..."
1,saint who?,SAW THE VID .LET`S SEE` WE`LL PLAY IN A PRISON TO SHOW WERE BAD AND WE ROCK.SORRY EVERYONE .METALLICA DIED WITH CLIFF CASE CLOSED. NEW BASS PLAYER IS COOL. THANK GOD NEWSTEAD LEFT.WHAT ZUP WITH THE CD COVER? IS THAT SPIDERMAN`S HAND OR THE HULK`S? ANYWAYS YOUR ON AMAZON HAVE SOME PATIENCE .THERE`S PLENTY OF GREAT BANDS HERE.
1,What happened?,"I can't understand this album. Metallica went from the best, with Kill 'Em All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Justice...to this? They seemed to start losing it with Load and Reload, and even the Black Album, but I never anticipated this. There are no guitar solos, the vocals are terrible, the lyrics are stupid and redundant, and it sounds like Lars sold his drum kit and bought a couple trash cans to bang on.Don't waste your money on this. Buy Master of Puppets instead. Hell, don't even waste your time pirating this. Hopefully their next one will be better, but after the past decade and a half I don't expect much from them."
1,The biggest piece of trash ever,"I'm an old fan...haven't liked a thing since ""...and Justice""... but this is the biggest piece of crap to ever be released. And in reality you gotta figure that this is nothing more than a jab back at those that download Metallica's music. They put nothing into this. No time, no thought, no emotion, nothing. And of course, the production is about as trashy as a 4-track tape recorder...so they put no money into it either. And so they put this piece of S**T out there and make a good load of millions off all the suckers that actually buy it. Good way to make up for the money they believe they're losing from file sharing. Don't buy this! Don't support these sell-outs. A few years from now you'll see Metallica trying to re-gain the suppport of all the old fans they turned their backs on.I buy music regularly. I downloaded this out of spite. I deleted it after downloading...not even worth it when it's free. nu-Metallica sucks."
1,ST.Anger SUX,"worst Metallica ever.I am going to give it away if I can find someone to take it.Tried to give it to my brother,he said it sux also. I would have given it no stars if I could"
5,"Give this album a try, you might change your mind.","This CD by Metallica is by all accounts raw, unpolished, angry, and most of all...REAL. Looking at all the band was going through, I look at this album as therapy and it is good. Nobody can churn out such precise rhythm riffage as James Hetfield, and while as raw as the open wounds spilling from the band members, the album has some great songs here. Is it Master of Puppets? Black Album? No, thankfully Metallica is a band that grows and so we get to hear them through the process, rather than them cranking out the same album over and over. Give the album a try, rip off the band-aids that cover you and bleed as St. Anger hits you like a freight train!"
2,what a disappointment !,"i knew metallica was about to create a new album, but they really lost their sound...where's king nothing,creeping death or fade to black sound?this album doesn't look like a metallica album it's more like panthera or other terrible bands with loud voices.this is definitly not my favorite band anymore...but st anger ,the song, sounds good and Summerslam really helped to drop the album...but..."
1,What happened to Metallica?,"Ok, I've thought long and hard on this one. After listening to this CD continuous times since it came out, I've come to the determination that Jason Newsted made the smartest move by leaving. What in the hell was Lars thinking when he decided that playing on a trash can gave a good sound? And how can you even give yourself credibility as a real band when you can only play 2 songs from your new album live? Aside from the fact that they actually are playing heavy riffs on this album again, this album bites the big one. ""Invisible Kid"" is an absolutely garbage song and I hope Metallica realizes that they need to refund everyone that bought this album. They need to stop reinventing their music and stick with what worked: ""Master of Puppets"" and ""...And Justice for All"". God help you if you think this album deserves more than 2 stars."
1,Fashionably Terrible,"It seems Metallica is trying to set a new fashion in music. The no-fidelity sound. I've heard of lo-fi, like Cake and Meat Puppets, but Metallica just created no-fi. The recording is so blatantly terrible that I can't enjoy the music. It's a gimmick but one I hope does not set any kind of trend. I'm miserably disappointed with this album."
5,age old tallica fan,this album is a non reminicent new start for tallica new sound same boyz {save for newsted} it is a raw hard burn with lemon juce on top
1,So much for the hype,"They released this album early, they might has well had waited until the release date or even later. What happened to Metallica? Where are the moving guitar riffs? What happened to the drum sound? Even more, James' singing...well, if you waste your money, you'll see. There are no more epic Metallica songs. Load was bad, Reload was worse and this has hit bottom. Gone are the days of Puppets, One and Sandman...They've faded to black."
1,all sounds the same,every song on this disk sounds exactly like the one before. there is no clean guitar lines for kirk which is a major mistake. they seem like they're trying to get back to the old metallica but can't quite get there.
1,Commercial Suicide? More like Fanbase suicide!,Commercial suicide???!!! WHAT...I am still speechless. I don't know what to say. I am sad and scared. All I have is one question for Metallica...What happened?
2,What the hell were they thinking ???,"I love Metallica Old and New. What the hell were theythinking ??? This album is dark and fuzzy. So fuzzy thatthe music sounds like it's going in all different directions.And the drums...Lars has the best sounding kickers combinedwith the worst sounding snare...PING. The Lyrics are weak.James needs a beer. On a positive note you get a nice DVD withthe purchase. Buy it because it's Metallica, but don't expectto much you'll be disappointed."
1,It's the songs that really [are bad]...,"I agree with the people who think the production [is bad], but look at the White Stripes--I'm no fan, but they can get away with a goofy-sounding vocalist, a K-Mart drum set, and no bass because they write good music (just check out Audioslave's kick-...live version of ""Seven Nation Army""). The real problem with St. Anger is that the songs [are bad]. The title track is probably the most awful song I've heard in a long time. I don't care if it's nu-metal or old school, just write good music!"
4,finally,"THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I CAN SAY I WAS EXCITED TO PURCHASE A METALLICA ALBUM AND EVEN MORE NOW THAT I HAVE. NO MORE MAINSTREAM GARBAGE, BACK TO THE REAL THING."
1,honest from a fan way back in the 80's,I loved this band so much I actually paid a lot of money for a BETA tape of an old concert where Dave Mustaine was still on guitar. I've been with them since the beginning and it hurts to say just how terrible this cd is. The DVD is actually better due to the drums not sounding like plastic buckets. What happened Lars? STay away from the napster kids and practice again. You forgot everything that got you where you are. You need to listen to your own music. I know a place where you can download it for free....
4,operation experimentation,"I have been a hard core metallica fan since the third grade. In my opinion metallica is finaly getting back to their roots. They were the band that made everyones jaw drop when you hear them. The heavy, fast, hard, insane music that I fell in love with is coming back and metallica follows. They are just going to shock people like they once did in 1982 and beyond and they are just trying to brauden peoples senses of music one more time. they want to expand on what they started. They want to give people something they have never heard before. Load and Re-Load was Metallica's experimental stages and now they are at it again but have changed their approach(for the better). Load and Re-Load were good but METALLICA IS BACK!"
3,a little disappointing,As others have stated the snare drum has a new sound. Unfortunatly it is the most prominent instrument in each song and really bugs the heck out of me. As stated before the lack of guitar solos really makes each track drag on a bit and blur together.As a long time Metallica fan I am a little disappointed but Metallica has proven themselves time and time again so I cant blame them for trying something new.I do have to say though the more I listen to it the more I start to enjoy it. Maybe its because these songs are actually very complex (many over 7 and 8 minutes) and take some time to understand unlike the 2 minute songs of Linkin Park etc.
1,another disappointment,"yet another piece of garbage,churned out by a band that should have called it quits when cliff died.on this cd they try to go back to playing really heavy,but it just doesn't work.where are the guitar solos? james singing is awful as always.and the sound mix is horrific.shame on metallica and bob rock for releasing this substandard album."
1,Taking Nu Metal to a Nu Level,"Well, I got caught up in the huge amounts of hype in this album and bought it the day of it's release. I had visions in my head of a return to the ""Master of Puppets"" and ""Ride the Lightning"" sound that defined Metallica as masters of speed metal. Instead, the result is an album that features absolutely horrible sound quality, vocals that don't even remotely sound angry and very poor lyrics such as ""tick tick tick tick tock"" and ""St. Anger don't get no respect."" The drum riffs are lackluster beyond belief and the guitar leads are dissappinting. The effects on the rhythm guitars sound like second-hand fuzz-boxes with a short-circut and the overall production is horrid. Hetfield's vocals come off sounding like the wails of a pre-pubescent boy rather than the screams of an angry grown man and Lars seems to have forgotten what a heavy metal drummer sounds like. The only thing Metallica should be angry about is how dissappointing this grossly over-hyped album actually is."
2,Completely Stunned,"I don't know what to say. I am so disappointed in this cd i keep listening to it over and over hoping it'll grow on me. It sounds like it was recorded in someone's basement with a voice recorder. There are no guitar solos, all the riffs sound the same. All the songs sound the same. The lyrics are crap, and I honestly can't think of anything good to say about it. I guess this was all the napster user's payback. Ouch, ouch, ouch.."
1,"Give me back the ""Real"" Metallica","We waited 6 years for this? I'm all for growing musically but this is ridiculous. I expected much better from them and Bob Rock [Producer]. This CD is aweful. Big deal we get a ""free"" DVD. I couldn't wait to give a listen and ended up skipping over every track looking for something better. Where ever they're going I'm not. I'll stick with the vintage Metallica. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Metallica's Back!,"From their last studio album, Re-Loaded, they come back with St. Anger; the true metal Metallica we love so much. All of the songs are full of anger and the music is hard and heavy. With 75+ min. of music, you will not be disapointed at all. My favorite songs are ""Frantic"" and ""St. Anger"". The bonus DVD is entertaining where James, Kirk, Lars and Robert play all the songs off the album uncut. The Metallica fans definatly need to get this!!!"
1,Lame,"Crappy sound, lacks originality, not worth 4$ in the bargain bin. Those who give this 4 stars or more are, quite frankly, those Metallica fans who like anything the band produces, regardless."
1,If we only knew what was to come,"In 1991 Metallica released the black album. Hard core fans at the time didn't like the new direction the band was going in. That record may not have been as epic or as heavy as Master of Puppets, but was a damn good CD. The sound was unreal, but I regress. Fast-forward to 2004 the the release of St. Anger. Pure garbage. We knew the band was going down hill in the late 90's, but nobody thought they could go this low. What the hell is Lars playing on here? Rusty trash cans, his mothers pots and pans, what?This band did rule the hard rock world for about 3 or 4 years, but those days are long gone. If this was the record that Matallica put out in 1991 when the so called hard core fans were up in arms, this band would have been dead then and that would have been it. Maybe they just didn't want any downloading thier music, they have nothing to worry about here."
1,St. Garbage - Not (just) Metallica's Worst!,"St. Anger is not just Metallica's worst album ... This is probably the worst rock album by a major, tier 1 band of all time!! Who can think of a worse album by an all-time great band? Imagine 4000 reviews by hard-core Metallica fans who are dying to hear a Metallica album that they will love. But instead they get this piece of trash. Startlingly bad! This is probably an example of what happens when superstars are told over and over that everything they do is great; they actually start to believe it. Thank god they redeemed themselves with Death Magnetic.Funny - I went to the Metallica concert after they made St. Anger. The fans were excited, standing, shouting, until Metallica would play a song from St. Anger. Then everyone would sit down and take a break."
1,St. Anger,"This album was a huge disappointment. I don't know what Metallica is trying to sound like, but this is not the Metallica that I know and love. If you are into sissy bands like System of a Down then maybe this album is for you. What happened to the crunchy heaviness that this band is known for? I would have to say that Metallica has certainly sold out on this one. To sum it all up in one word, this album sux."
1,The future of Rock?,Wat th f***! This album is the future of Metalicca's demise from the throne of Metal Gods more like. I read with interest that Metalicca have gone through re-hab to write this piece of trash. Well re-hab obviously took all their talent away. Do us a favour Metallic go back on the bottle for the fans.
4,"Good, but....","Overall, this album was pretty good. The song which shares the title of the album, ""St. Anger"", is absolutely incredible, as is ""Some Kind of Monster"", but there are others that are not nearly up to par, like ""Frantic"", where both the lyrics and the guitar work were absolutely horrible. However, the songs that are good more than make up for those bad songs in there."
1,ITS SAD BUT TRUE! BUT NONE OF THESE SONGS MATTER!!!!!!,"Dont get me wrong Metaillca is GREAT but this new cd does not even to desirve to be on the shelfs...no solos,no good lyrics writing, and Lars how can you play drums that sound like trash cans? If Metallica ever looks at this review, I think every one wants to hear another Metallica cd with some great music like kill em all or ride the lightning maybe even load. But how can you let a reputaion go to crap by one crappy cd!"
3,ok,"This album is really hard to review because it's weird and i don't know what to make of it. For some odd reason i like frantic(no clue why as it's not that good), and i also like their next 4 songs. The rest of the album is complete crap though. If this is all metallica has to offer for the rest of the career i'm gonna lose interest very, very fast. I've been forgiving towards metallica many, many times. load was a decent album, reload i thought was pretty bad, garage inc. (other than disc 2) was bad, and st. anger was better but it was still pretty bad. They better put on one good show when i see them in milwaukee though..."
3,Good Statement,"This album is a great statement for the band after all they've been through in the last few years. The only problem I have is the mix of the drums. I know what kind of sound they were going for and all that, I just think they could have made the kit sound so much more powerful, instead it dosen't have the trademark Lars Ulrich power sound. The guitars are really raw too but I like that. I think the songs are awesome though. It's all thrash kick your ass get it all out music. Good stuff to work out to"
3,A real review by a real Metallica fan,"I'm kind of the typical Metallica fan, who loves Ride the Lightning and .....And Justice for all and all of the other classic albums, but I must come out and say something about this album. It does not suck. It isnt exactly good, either. But everyone has to admit that this really is a good comeback to the pieces of crap labeled ""load"" and ""reload"". Metallica is my favorite metal band, but to this day I still refuse to buy those two. I was reluctant to even purchase this album, but seeing it on ebay as a promo and so cheap I decided to, because if it sucked I could just give it away without remorse. But this an allright album. It is not ""Master of Puppets"". But compared to some of the sadder ""nu-metal"" acts such as Slipknot and Mudvayne, this album isnt bad."
1,i wish i could give this a minus 5 stars,Why listen to some clown that gets paid to write these reviews?Do what metallica has always said they were in the music business for.Listen to the people that pays their hard earned money on the material they put out.The people are saying that this cd sucks.The people have spoken!Live with it non believers!
1,This CD sucks,"This is the worst album i have ever heard. When it first came out i thought i would give it a try since it's metallica and i like everything they make... but when i heard it i thought this is unbelievable how much this sucks. None of the songs on it are good. What happend to metallica? All of thier older albums are the best(master of puppets, ride the lightning,...and justice for all). I do not recommend this album, it's not worth the money"
5,One of their Best!,"One of the best Metallica albums! They took the chance again and they proof that the most of the new bands are doing overproduced, alternative, boring pop-or rap-sounding albums ! Metallica went back to the rougher sound of the 70-ties and early eighties when the best metal albums were created and combined it with some nu-metal flavor and created a masterpiece! The only song which i don't like is"" Invisible kid"" but the rest is so good that I cannot stop listening to the album! Yes, they are no solos, but if you listen carefully you'll realise that they are simultaneaus solos from all instruments all the time! I've never heard such a great drumming for years! This is a whole new level of metal music! Five stars all along! If you don't like this album, listen to Linkin'Park and Limp Bizkit. But don't consider them heavy metal!"
1,Oh man...,"Okay, this album was a huge dissapointment to me. I am a huge Metallica fan, but they took out everything i liked about them in this latest cd!!! Metallica used to be it's own genre... there's metal, and there's rock, and then there's Metallica. Not true anymore! Now they're just another screaming metal band! I guess it's not really that bad of an album, if you take off the Metallica label- it's just not the same Metallica sound i love! It sounds like they're just trying to keep up with the times or something... like they don't want the same sound as in their 80's albums. What they seemed to miss, however, was that that sound is what made them Metallica, and it's what made their fans, fans."
2,True Metallica fans will be disappointed,Where is Kirk in this album? There are no solos in this album. Lars drumming is tight but that ringing noise gets annoying after awhile. Sounds like he's hitting pots and pans. The good side is this is definitely a heavier album and it's a with good rhythm guitars from James. The lyrics needs a little work. This album sounds incomplete and should of spent more time in the studio because it almost sounds like nu-metal.
2,OK.........,"Metallica is awesome to begin with, so going in to this you can feel confident that it is good. The new disk from the best trash-metal band ever is good, with some highlights and some that they could have left off. ""St. Anger"" the song is great, as is ""Invisible Kid"", ""My World"", ""Shoot Me Again"" and ""Sweet Amber"". The really great part of this is that you get a free DVD of the band playing the entire album in rehersal. The better part is the access code you get to download live tracks. The live stuff is great. Buy this just for the live stuff. If you are a fan now, get this. ... Metallica still sounds good, althouhg not great."
3,"I'm not in love, at all!","Overall, I think this album is terribly disappointing! Its an uncohesive whole - some good grooves, but nothing sticks together.I read it was going to be like the old stuff, but at the end of the day, nothing can touch ""Kill 'Em All,"" ""Ride the Lightning"" and ""Master of Puppets."" The band only wishes they could be that brilliant again.I think I could probably put this cd away in the drawer and never pull it out again - sad."
3,If it weren't for the lyrics...,"Being a long time 'Tallica fan I am sorry to have to say that this just downright sucks. After ""The Black Album"" tour they stopped caring about the fans and realized that with Bob Rock all they needed to care about was the cash. Load, ReLoad, and Garage Inc. were good but were not was 'Tallica is known to sound like. Excluding the live album, we zoom ahead almost 6 years and St. Anger is produced. Not only are the riffs simple, and the bass quiet, but the vocals are shot and there are no solos. The only thing creative about this album are the lyrics, and that's the only reason I rate it any stars at all. This not only shows the lack of ability to be the band they once were, but also puts forth an extreme level of disrespect for fans who were hoping for a catchy album after a long wait. They don't deserve another chance, but because they dumped Bob Rock and are currently making another album, I'll give it to them and listen to it when it is released."
5,What is everyone's problem?,"I've listened to this album several times and am still amazed at how good it is. Most professional music reviewers also like this album. So I'm shocked to see all these bad reviews. What is it that so many people hate about this album? Is it the lack of guitar solos, the fact that the lyrics aren't about satanic worship or just because of the band's fight with Napster and internet downloading?"
3,Still have lost something from their past glory,"St. Anger, an album that I eagerly anticipated for a number of years, turns out to be a slight disappointment. Back are the epic song lengths, but gone are the great melodies that were present in their past albums such as Ride the Lightning, And Master of Puppets. Present are songs that go from slow to extremely fast and hard within the song, but seemed like a rushed poorly crafted effort. Also, alot of the songs end up sounding very similar, there really is no change in momentum from beginning to end. They promised no ballads on this one and a return to the speed of the past which is back but not as arranged as well as the past when the most talented member of the band, the late Cliff Burton was present."
3,Back To The 80's,"Wow - I was not totally prepared for the recent onslaught by the boys having got used to the melodic (slower) Metallica of the last 11 years. If you are expecting a continuation of ""The Black Album"", ""Load"" or ""Reload"" you will be very dissapointed. This album takes us back to ""Master of Puppets"" which for some die hards is the greatest news they have heard all year.This album is intense to say the least with driving guitar work and heavy drums to back it up - Metallica is letting out what seems to be a decades worth of frustration and the end result although not their best work in my opinion will definitely hit the mark!!!!!"
1,HA HA HA!!!!!!,"If you are a new Metallica fan and don't know anything about them, let me just tell you, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!! The lyrics are so stupid it's not even funny! They dumped Jason Newsted and picked up Robert Trujillo for a bass player. This CD is sucks, don't by it."
1,Wha!!!!!!,"WHAT!!! is exactly right!!!!!How could you metalica! The most anticapted album ever turns out to be the worst album of the year!!!! Thanks alot! I wasted 16 bucks for this garbage! I hope you guys are happy you damn sell outs! The only good song in this crap that we call an album is st anger it self and frantic but the rest. CRAP!!!Thanks alot metalica you made me lose my respect in you.If you want a true metal masterpiece get Puppet masters, Black album,and justice for all.At least thats when the true gods of metal were good now theySUCK!I SPIT IN THIS ALBUM! THANKS ALOT!!!!1"
1,um nope....,"i'm for progression in music, i really am. but this just ain't cutting it. when your progressing as a musician, you have to hope it sounds good. and in this case, i think they had ear plugs in the whole time. thats the only reason i can think of for them to release this horrible album. the vocals are off pitch, the drums suck, and the guitars sound way too nu metalish for me. i think in flames must have not read any reviews on st anger because soundtrack to your escape sounded kind of like this as well...."
1,Bad Music. Nuff said,"I did not expect to recieve this cd for christmass, seeing as I didn't ask for it (thank god i didnt actually spend money on this piece of $h!t) but when I got it, I sort of felt as if I had just been let down. I had always, in a way, sort of respected Metallica, as good musicians, occasionally hearing good stuff like ""Enter Sandman"" and ""Master of the Puppets"" on the radio. But this cd defined ""cr@pola"" its just a bunch of angry tuneless singing, (except bad unlike System of a Down) guitar that sounds like its done by my friend's twelve year old brother, and then some mediocre drumming. (the drums may have actually been ok enough to qualify for the level of decent.) However, if you are convinced that this music is worth buying, i will admit that ""Saint Anger"" and ""Invisible Kid"" have a bit more work put in to them than all the other cr@p. So, if you must, get yourself 2 dollers and go down to the iTunes website, and save yourself some pain."
1,What Happen...?,"This can't be Metallica?!? Is this cd supposed to be a joke? It's horrible! It sounds like banging on pots and pans, someone jumping up and down on the guitars, and James ""singing"". I NEVER would have thought that Metallica would ever make a cd this bad! This disc is easily the biggest disappointment in recent memory. *sigh*..."
2,"horrible, but a little under-rated","by a little, i mean 'Frantic' is a good song, but thats about it.. Im not going to waste my time creatively bashing it, since thats been done a few thousand times on this site."
1,Negative stars,"THIS ALBUM SUCKS. There is nothing good at all about this album. The vocals sound screwed up, Bob Rock put down the bass tracks and they suck, nothing is tight, the drum tone sucks, and there are no solos. I dont know what they were thinking on this but if they want to sound like the just started they need to go back to Kill Em ALl."
1,metallica is dead,"They say if dont like it shut up but then take it off the metal media. Im so (...) sick of all the talk of this over rated horse (...). buy some In Flames, Cannibal Corpes, Death, Morrbid Angel,Shadows Fall, Meshuggah,Decapitated. Well just buy some real metal.Bands that dont get any real credit do to these rich over rated mother (...)"
1,80's Heavy Metal is still alive and rocking? are you kiddin,"if load and reload is worst this is so far one the greatest bad albums of all time no explanations needed its a bad album, Im once a big fan of James Hetfield when comes to creativity and song writing ability but he just ruined my respect for him."
1,- 10 star,"worst metal album ever existthis is why the put the dvd for free with same priceall the songs are same category ... that is ""crap""drum snare + trash canvocal = old cowboy sytlebass = normalguitar solo = noguitar riff = total repeativelyrics - total repeativeoverall = no nothing"
1,"Yeah, i went there",whats this? is this even Metallica? only good ones are Frantic and some kind of monster. Re-Load was pretty good buy that insted of this. this a failure for metallica. BRING BACK NEWSTED!!!!!
2,I will be nice.,"I am going to be nice to these guys--- because, frankly, they scare me. But bluntly, this offering sounds like it was very quickly recorded and produced. Does anyone have any explanation as to why the ""rush""? I think we all would have been willing to have a longer wait for a better effort."
1,This isn't music,"I don't want to criticize St. Anger because it's neither bad nor good. It isn't music as such at all, so it is not worth the time. Don't buy the junk - save your money for a rainy day!Best wishes,Alex"
1,This should have 0 stars...,"I agree with all the other reviewers who gave this album a one star review (although most probably wouldn't have given it any stars), so I don't have anything to add except hopefully contribute to bringing amazon's cumulative rating down from a 3 star as much as possible.THIS ALBUM SUCKS"
1,Good Coaster for Your Beer,"I'm almost shocked that anyone can say postive things about this album, much less say it's ""their best."" This compilation of noise is anything but their best--in fact it's their worst. I don't care enough about Metallica anymore to wonder what they were trying to accomplish by recording these tracks. My little brother's garage band has better songs than the ones on St. Anger, and his band is only marginally good.I've put up with some mediocre LPs from Metallica for years now, giving them the benefit of the doubt that the quality of their first five albums bought for them. Well, their previous efforts and their ""brand"" name no longer attracts me to spend money on their music. I've made them richer by buying their CD, and in return I've gotten nothing but a headache from it.No more. I'll have to hear the entire thing before I buy another Metallica LP, because the name Metallica painted on a CD cover no longer guarantees great music."
1,"""Sad But True.""","Every hardcore 'tallica fan such as I knows metallica has lost it ever since they cut their hair during the black album era. Sure load and reload we're bearable but st. anger... this cd is downright horrible. What surprised me the most of all was lars drumming, anyone whos heard the song blackened knows lars drumming capabilities...also what happened to the guitar solos kirk!? I mean c'mon they would've been better of just releasing a greatest hits cd."
2,Below average effort,"Once upon a time Metallica were the trailblazers of the genre and each album they released would become the footstep upon which a whole macrocosm of heavy rock music would follow.The last time this happened was with the Black Album. In the late 90's Metallica would offer us gradually weaker efforts and in 2003 they offer this one which is their weakest of the lot.This album is marred by plain bizarre quality of production, even more bizarre drumming, stripped down, toned down nu metal technique, but the biggest problem is the lack of quality in the songs themselves.The DVD which accompanies the package features a live performance of the whole album in the studio and the sound quality is somehow better than the album's; which speaks volumes about the album itself.I believe this time Metallica have failed to produced a work which would carry any significance whatsoever. Instantly forgettable stuff"
2,Ok album- not great,"Ok, first off.. Heaven Beside You ""Hell Within"" is a moron. Why was it necessary to bash Ozzy, Megadeth, etc. in order to ""review"" this album? ""St. Anger"" is an album I can listen to once in a while, for a short time and, it's a step in the right direction...HOWEVER, I can't listen to it like I do Metallica's early stuff. In further response to Heaven Beside You ""Hell Within,"" MEGADETH long ago eclipsed Metallica and they remain a solid band while Met are struggling to regain their cred."
1,metallica needs to quit or go back in time.,"This album sucks. It sucks like the black album sucked. It sucks like both load and re-load sucked. Everything metallica has done since its last great creation (And justice for all...) has totally sucked. At least they managed to put out four seriously amazing albums before the close of the 1980's, that's about the only reason why I still hvae a teenytiny bit of respect for them."
5,This is BRILLIANT!!,"What is everyone complaining about? Are you not listening to the amazingly brilliant lyrics on this album? To quote a particularly inspired chorus: ""Fran-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-toc...Fran-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-toc...Fran-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-tic-toc!"" See? Not just any moron could write such moving lyrics. Keep up the good work guys!"
1,"""0 stars was not an option""","I used to love Metallica growing up as a kid. The first album i picked up was ""Master of Puppets"" and i was in love with the band. As the years went on i was more and more disappointed with what i heard. I was able to handle the ""justice"" album, the black album i could just barely handle. Load and reload were a freaking joke, and the only reason i liked garage inc. was because of the mercyful fate covers and the 2nd disk of garage days rerevisited. Just what the hell is this crap called ""st anger""?? They should of renamed it ""st toilet"" because this material should have been flushed down the pipes. Nothing but crap! Enough said."
1,minus 2 stars,"first of all..all you kids 16 and under and think metallica's first cd came out in 91. and to all the people who protect this peice of garbage disguised as a cd...metallica was a promising thrash band from the mid-80's. and absolutely killer albums( kill em all, ride the lightning, master of puppets). and sadly, their demise when Cliff died. theres only a shell of a band now. what used to be angry, pissed off, talented musicians now stand as ""we don't give a F**k"" rock stars. even a dead Cliff needs dramamine he's rolled in his grave so many times. ok, back to st. s**t. thats it. it's what i expected. garbage. i can go on about lars and his crying about so called pirating music online. but thats another subject. besides my side is hurting from laughing. hard to type you know....metallica is dead..kids please don't go out and buy a cd without bringing someone with you who actually knows what good metal is. ok, i'm done."
3,It says a lot about Metallica's enduring popularity...,"...that such a mediocre album could attract 3,800 reviews, most of which say essentially the same thing, in less than two years."
1,Is this a Joke,"The fact that this album has somehow received an average of 3 stars is unfathomable.I have tried to convince myself to like this CD, but it lacks verything that ever made Metallica what it was. This sounds like a bad Nirvana cover band with a drummer who thinks he's God, a lackluster session bassist, and a lead singer who's had one too many drinks. Oh, wait a second...The production is miserable, it sounds like it was recorded in my basement. James' voice has gone to crap, the music has lost its edge. Kirk seems to have had no input into this album, and Lars needs to turn back the clock, as well as turn down the volume on the drum mics.I'm normally forgiving as far as bands exploring new territory, especially one as close to my heart as Metallica, the band that turned me into a metalhead 15 years ago. But has far as this album, excuse the pun, Metallica is Unforgiven."
1,What the F@#k is going on here!!!!????,"Metallica used to mean something. They stood for METAL ATTITUDE. They burst on to the music scene in the early eighties with an ""I don't give a s#$t"" outlook on life. They changed the face of Rock music. I don't care what some diehard fans say, I think Metallica really has sold out (Hell, they started to sell out after Cliff died!). There's good forms of change and bad forms of change and Metallica is a perfect example of the latter. If you don't believe me, take a look at their contemporaries. Metallica, a band who opened up for Venom (BLACK F#@$&N METAL NEW YORK! Sorry, I just had to write that!) numerous times in 1982 (on the ""Seven dates of Hell"" tour) and 1983 now has the gaul to tour with bands like Linkin park and the Deftones. Hail Death, Opeth, Hypocrisy, Arch enemy, Children of Bodom, The forsaken, Meshuggah, Enslaved, Vomitory, Amon amarth, Bolt thrower, Kataklysm, Bathory and Shadows fall. To Hell with Metallica."
1,Old guys can't Rock,"I really didn't buy this CD, I'm not making these guys any money. I just wanted to let you guys know that these guys are one of the reasons why Napster was shut down and started this whole RIAA bullsh*t. RIAA seem like they have good intentions with this lawsuit but if you dig deeper they are in it for the money also. They couldn't stand (especially Lars) losing money after they already made their millions. Sell outs to the fullest. Big label bands suck except for a few exceptions. Not only that I did hear their new CD suck to make this review official. So don't make them any more money and don't waste your money."
3,cant they do better???,"metallica has released a pure ""nu-metal"" album. they do not suit that kind of metal. they need to go back to the way they used to be before. if they make another album they should make it like kill em all, ride the lightning, master of puppets or and justice for all. but this album is good to listen to when you want to get pumped. and when they made this album they didnt have rob as their bassist, their producer bob rock filled in the bass parts."
3,"Heavy and fast but,,,,","old time Metallica was much better than now. They were real Heavy Metal band. When I listened to Master of Puppets, I was totaly kicked axx."
2,they tried but i dont think they suceeded,"This album isnt THAT bad, except for the repetitive songs. Ever song repeats itself way too much. The main drop of Metallica was Bob Rock, what an a**hole. He popularized them and his influence has made their music ability go completley downhill. He came aboard on the Black Album which was a good album, but ever one after that has gone downhill. This is a little better than RELoad but so f**king what?"
2,The music really is good...,"The music written for St. Anger is absolutely fine. The lyrics aren't supposed to be good. The singing isn't supposed to be perfect. The music is supposed to be fast and not very complicated. It is an angry album, and that's ok. Some of the songs on here are absolutely perfect......except the production just kills it all. The drums, man...the drums! Why the bad drum sound? What made them think that this sound would be ok? It is very unfortunate. Frantic, Sweet Amber, Purify, All Within My Hands...all of these would be great metal songs, but the drum sound completely ruins it. The DVD is much easier for me to listen to, because the drums there sound like they're supposed to.The lack of solos is a minor gripe I have. You can pinpoint in both Sweet Amber and Purify exactly where a guitar solo should be. But this pales in comparison to my complaint about the drumming. This could have been a 4-star album for me, but instead it gets a 2 for being very badly produced good music."
3,"its new metal, but not like korn or evanecence crap!!!!!","the only fault in this album is the ausence of solos, WHY METALLICA DONT PUT SOME SOLOS IN THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!"
2,LOST SOULS,"I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM SEVERAL TIMES TO GET A FEEL FOR IT, BUT IT NEVER HAPPEN. LETS FACE IT OLD SCHOOL METALLICA FANS THESE GUYS DONT HAVE IT IN THEM ANY MORE."
4,Kinda like it a lot,"I'm not 'into' Metallica for that long and to be honest, this was my second album (S&M was my first)! Picked it up for a few dollars and grew into it during long roadtrips. I agree the drums are really tinny but you have to learn to listen to this in an other way than you're used to.Since this album I began buying their older stuff. Okay Black album's better and all the albums sound cleaner, but St.Anger sounds so much more different from the rest. It's incomparable and I happen to like it. The more you change the more you stay the same so let's take the change as a good thing."
1,Very Disappointed.,"When I bought this cd, I couldn't wait to listen to it. St.Anger, sucks. Flat out sucks. I am very disappointed in Metallica. I expected MUCH more. In this CD there is NO guitar solos. All the songs are the same, and the drumming sound is bad. Very. Very clingy sounding. Metallica is still the best ""older"" rock band out there. I highly recomend ANY other Metallica CD's."
1,Meh...,"I really wanted to like this album. I've been a long time fan of Metallica and I have to say, this is the worst album I've heard in a long time. There's only two somewhat decent songs on it; St. Anger and Some Kind Of Monster and they're not even that great.I dont know why I dont like this album. I think it's because everything that I dont like in music has been lumped together in one big pile of garbage. This is coming from someone who liked when they experimented and came out with Load. I liked that one, but this one is horrible.Here's to the next album, I hope they dont make a ""ReSt.Anger"".Save your money and go buy Iced Earth or Anthrax's new albums."
1,Avoid at All Costs,"Absolutely terrible. Avoid this pile of garbage at all costs, I have lost respect for Metallica due to it. How can a band go from writing songs like Master of Puppets and One to vomiting out the throwaway crap on this album? The world may never know. Instead of attempting to answer the question, save yourself the 15 dollars or so and don't buy this cd."
1,Metallica has completely lost their edge!----what a bunch of pathetic has beens!,"This is the lamest attempt at a comeback since Micheal Jackson's ""Greatest Hits"" CD in 2001! Every second of music on this cd is pathetic, there is not even ONE even remotely listenable song. The music is uninspired, boring, unoriginal, and uncreative. The band members have no interesting songwriting ideas, all they do is repeat a bunch of downtuned nu metal riffs over and over and over, and just stop whenever they get tired. James Hetfield's ""tough guy"" voice sounds forced. Those monotonous guitar riffs and ""PING PING PING"" drums combined with his growling about his anger problems are more irratating than Green Day's ""American Idiot"" CD!Metallica, if this is the best you can do, its either time to retire or just play on the ""oldies"" circuit! You went 6 years between albums and THIS garbage is the best you can do? That's pathetic, and you guys are pathetic. What a bunch of pathetic has beens."
1,Don't Buy this album,"Although I am more than a Metallica enthusiast I must say this album is odd and it sounds more like a really noisy teenagers wannabe metal band. Very poor drums (as discordant as they get), and a huge lack of guitar participation.Quite disappointing... Don't waste your money on this. Is the kind of album you keep skipping songs to try to find at least a good one and you will rapidly find yourself again in Track 1."
4,Stupid Kid Review,"I may not have this cd yet(gonna get it). But where do you come off saying that Metallica was never a good band to begin with. There melodic guitar playing, and bone crunching lyrics, has brought them to greatness, in any musical generation. I know its a downer that there new cd doesn't have a solo to be heard, but that doesnt mean it wont get better in there next cd(especially since Robert Trujillo well actually been on this one).I have been playing guitar for almost 4 years and i have yet to come across anything so dynamic, creative, and elaborate as Kirk Hammet's guitar playing. It's bone-heads like you that don't look at what people might be going and shamefully abuse their talents. It may not be a classic but im sure it's worth a try."
3,Good But Dirty,"Growing up on the intricate crazy guitar work of albums like Master of Puppets, Ride The Lightning and the Black Album St. Anger fell short of expectations. The long hiatus from the Studio much have rocked acouple brain cells in the bands heads, their new dirty deeper toned guitar out of place guitar licks make this seem like an unorganized unproduced album. Now, don't get me wrong it does have it moments good beats,catchy melodies do stand out from the turmoil the album is. In my opinion, this is still a transition from the Metallica of old to their new form, although its taken 3 albums to really evolve their sound to something as good or as better than quick, thrash style of old. Metallica can still do it and I would not mind hearing that sound once more or even something better. Overall,GOOD album but it doesn't fill expectations."
3,The Noise is Back,"That's it, the noise is back!!!!!!!!Metallica comes with a new sound, the best word to describe this album is the word BRUTAL.The heaviest album of all!As a Metallica fan i'm quite dissapointed the sound is everything but clean especially the drums it looks like Lars is playing on a can....The thing that really bothered me was that after listening 75 minutes of Metallica's return (after 7 years without any studio album ) i didn't hear ANY GUITAR SOLO!!!!!! i'll repeat again, this album does not contain guitar solos!!!! only noise,noise and noise... with two of the best guitar players of the world you don't hear a single guitar solo in 75 minutes.....i'm really [mad].i like the speed and the power of the album but ....i think there is something's missingAfter all is a Metallica album, i'll respect that...."
3,mixed results,"I am a huge Metallica fan and I've enjoyed everything they've done, whether it's Kill 'Em All, Master of Puppets, or Reload. I really was looking forward to St. Anger, but I have to admit it's a little disappointing. It's not the return to the pre-Black album days that you may have heard. The full, varied, complex writing/playing style is back, but the music & lyrics seem scattered and the sound is that of a garage band, rather than of a studio produced album. That's not necessarily bad, you may like that, but it just doesn't really lend itself to cranking up the stereo and getting you rear kicked like you should with Metallica. On the positive side, it's dark, heavy, pretty fast at times and the songs have a lot to them. The songs will grow on you. Just don't expect to hear something like 'Battery' or 'Creeping Death' when you put the CD in the first time."
3,Wow,"I have never ""reviewed"" an album before, but you people are just complete morons. You make me want to never come to amazon.com again.If you're going to review a product, then review IT! Not your experiences with your girlfriend's mother's spouse's abused nephew."
2,good songs...horrible production,"ok...the album doesn't hold a candle to kill em, lightning, or master....BUT the songs do rock. if the production was anything worth a damn (Bob...nice try, but don't try to re-invent the wheel), it would be a killer 4 star album. And, guys, let Kirk rip a solo every now and then. Man!"
2,Metallica lost their way,"Most people harp about what a load of crap Load and Reload are. Well, let me tell you that those may not be traditional Metallica albums in the sense that their old ones followed but at least they were well produced, had some grooves, variety, and just overall rocked in some parts. St. Anger somehow was supposed to go back the days of old. Well whatever happened I don't know. This album is a total mess in the production department. Lars sounds like he's just banging away on a tin can over and over again. I normally love his playing, but something went terribly wrong here. James vocals are all over the place. Kirk has no solos...not one!! Now this album is by far one of their heaviest but it lacks any memorable tracks, other than maybe Frantic, St. Anger and Some Kind of Monster. It just seems to be same song over and over again for almost 80 minutes and let me tell you that can get very tedious after awhile. FOR DIEHARD FANS ONLY that think Metallica can do no wrong."
5,Awesome for any St. MetallicA fan,All I have to say is that this is an AWESOME c.d. and the dvd kicks major MetallicA ass. Every song on this c.d. will slam you into the floor and grind your teeth to dust. The first time I popped this c.d. into my player it reminded me of the way MetallicA sounded in Master and the earlier c.d.'s. In closing I am not saying you have to by this c.d. if you don't want to. I am just saying that I am a die hard MetallicA fan and have been forever. This is one of the best c.d.'s MetallicA has ever put out.
5,Brilliant!!!,"Finally we see metallica going back to their thrash style in such titles as Master of Puppets. In this album the band seem to be really showing how [ticked] they are and how they are giveing the finger to everyone who doesn't agree with them. The first single and title single st. anger is a great release and this album makes a 6 year wait almost seem worth it. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF METALLICA BUY THIS, AND IF YOUR NOT STILL BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!"
2,A poor attempt to regain their heavy roots,"One thing I've always liked about Metallica is their way of using dynamics like no other metal band I've heard. It seems as if on this album their ""blowing their load"" too soon and leaving me for one, bored.When I heard that their next album would be heavier like classic Metallica I was excited and anticipated the release. They released the album early so I went and bought it and now I wish I would have sampled it first. There aren't any guitar solos just drop D struming that get's really boring after the first few tracks. Lars really should think of losing the bell sound his snare has because I don't know if it's just me but it get's a tad old quick.One thing that this album has that no other does is great packaging, artwork and a cool DVD with the exact same track listing being performed. I thought this was a great idea. But this dosn't save the lack of Metallica I've grown to love, excluding The Black album, Load and Reload."
4,"not load , reload (thank goodness)","Huge metallica fan! huge dissapointment with load and reload. St. Anger is a breath of fresh air. I haven't heard them play this much riff in along time. No solos, strange but doesn't take away from anything. Every song over 5 mins! I'm just extremely happy they opended there ears and heard all the crap out there now a days and they showed they could top it easy without being flashy."
1,ROFL,"Metallica is no longer heavy metal/speed metal from their Kill'Em'All days, and this is the pinnacle example. I listened to the St Anger radio version, and I nearly died laughing. Then somebody told me it was St Anger, the latest Metallica single. My laughter nearly turned to tears. Metallica is officially punk rock now, a genre which I loathe more than country and rap put together. I was hoping they'd stick with their power metal trend they set with Reload (RELOAD WAS GOOD, SILENCE ALL YOU NAY-SAYERS!), but I guess that was too much to ask for. Sigh. But hey, spend money on it if you're into punk rock. You'll probably like it."
5,A veteran unleashes an awesome record,"This is a pretty good record, considering that in comparison the past 2 or three LP s haven't been VERY good.I find Metallica here going back to their roots. It is also good recruiting Rob Trujillo (a very well known bass player).We don t get the beautiful lightning speed leads from Ride the lightning or Master of Puppets, but St Anger has a personality or style of its own. It is raw, powered and in your face strong.Lets face it, Metallica is a musical phenomenon that has no equal. Years from now the future generations will hear Metallica music, and feel the power the musicians conjured up and made on record and live. I am very happy w the record and its sound and energy. To anyone who finds that the album 'lacks' anything, they should go undo their pessimism and enjoy the true good music; which is Metallica."
1,Not the Metallica of old...,"Alas, Metallica has not returned to the trailblazing metal of their formative years. Instead they seem to be trying to sound like everybody else. The music is very similar to the radio- friendl, sugar-coated mainstream rock one hears on radio. No solos, simple riffs, horrible lyrics, terrible drums...I could go on, really, but I think this summarizes my feelings (and the feelings of metal fans everywhere): I sold it two days after I bought it."
1,take a lap,"Hah. These guys need to take a lap. Oh, and F that douche Jaan Uhelszki for that laughable review written for the Amazon description. Just goes to show that amazon has no opinion - or rather, their opinion is always in the best interest of the person pawning their junk."
1,Horrible,"I'm an old school metal fan. I know what good metal and music is, and this is probably the worst alblum i ever heard. this comes from mabe the most overated band in history, and this is the proof. All these young metallica fans think they know what's going on, but they don't. How can anyone give this album 5 stars? are they deaf? No one in their right mind would give this a high rating."
2,2 Stars because it's Metallica,"Honestly, this CD is just plain awful. Metallica used to be one of the most bad ass rock metal groups around. Now it seems to me that they are trying to be appealing to the TRL crowd. It's sad when the first single (St. Anger) sucks so bad that it is taken off the radio in a week. The rest of the album somehow manages to be worse. Ouch. Stay far far way- Metallica is only a shadow of its former rockin' self."
3,its ok not great,"well im a huge fan of the band im even in the club.its not ther old stuff(any of it)but thats cool if your open minded.at first listen you wont like it but the more you listen like the other guy said first you will. the main thing is they made it that way to support the words,its mostly about insanity so they made the music soung off to.(only buy this album if your open minded and dont have your mind set on what metallica should sound like)with that said it not ther best by far(puppets is)but it is good,but i do hope they find ther roots or go back to what they were doing.people think its like ther old stuff cause they play fast again if you think the only thing that made them great was the speed they cold hit a note then go listen to megadeth that all they do is play fast."
3,Decent but not there best far from it,"Now i'll make this short and sweet i think people will enjoy this if they go in listening to this like they have never heard a metallcia cd and with open minds if you don't you will be crushed, like i was when i 1st heard this album. I feel they can still rebound though i haven't given up on you metallica!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"No Steps Forward, Two Steps Back","I didn't start out as a huge Metallica fan, but their music slowly grew on me. I really, really liked S&M because it seemed like they were growing musically and weren't afraid to try unconventional approaches to their performances. I am very disappointed with St. Anger, mostly because I feel the group has taken a step or two backwards artistically. The music sounds, pardon the pun, angry and it's more like something a new garage band might write, not a creation of an experienced, vetran group like Metallica. If I could go back in time, I would have waited to hear a few more songs released on the radio before buying this album."
3,"Not good,but not bad either......","This CD is certainly not what(In my opionion) people expected it to be.There are many boring tracks but my personal favorite,Unnamed Feeling,the shortest track,it good because i like it with Lars screaming his lungs out on the chorus.Another thing i would suggest is Lars,for the love of God,get a new drum set.its like this: bang,bang,PING!,bang,bang,PING!.......and so on"
1,worst cd ever,"I feel really bad about giving this album even one star, butthere is no 0 star or negative star option to show how trulyhorrible this cd is.High points of the album:I heard a guitar riff that I liked somewhere on the album, butthen it was lost behind horrible vocals, drums, etc.Low points of the album:Everything. Metallica should go ahead and replace James, Lars,and maybe even Kirk if he's done with guitar solos. Throw someguys in with just a little bit of talent to replace them andwe'll a much better band than this. This whole album soundslike trash.In review, I would not get this cd if I were paid the [money] totake it. There are no redeeming qualities. It's not that theychanged, it's that they didn't even try. If you're looking forthrash that sounds raw, there are tons of bands out there doingit, you just have to look around."
2,Long time fan..... dissapointed,"I have been a fan since the first song I heard from Metallica (Metal Militia). I bought my first Metallica album in 1987, and from then on bought every item of Metallica I could find. I have been to numerous concerts, and love every bit of Metallica. Until this album came out.... I am so dissapointed in this album. You could play their very first album/tape, and it would sound better than St. Anger. The production quality sounds that of a cheap 4 track recorder. I cannot believe that Bob Rock would let Metallica move in this direction, when he made them so much stronger in the early 90's. I agree that the drums sound horrid, and the songs sound like amateurs throwing licks together in some random fashion. Believe me when I say, I am still a huge fan, and will continue to be at every Metallica concert that comes near me, however I am just dissapointed in their newest album, and hope they recover from their mistake."
2,Sounds,"Like it was recorded inside a bathroom while somebody was taking a crap.Plop Plop Fizz Fizz Oh What A Relief It Is. -I think that I now know why none of these songs were performed live.""Some Kind Of Monster""?"
1,Metallica blows...,"Metallica sucks. They are Limp Bizkit for the kids from the grunge era (I shouldn't be able to name their entire fan base, but notice how customers who bought Metallica also bought Nirvana? (according to Amazon, but I don't need them to tell me I know anyway)) And now all their fans are complaining because they ""sold out"" or whatever. I am here to make the truth painfully obvious they always sounded like this only you didn't realize it until now, so quit saying they're imitating Britney Spears and get better tastes in music so you can't be stereotyped. Ever notice how Metallica fans always come home from a great game of football for their college (they were warming the bench of course) and play some Metallica to ""vent"" their anger because not only did they not get to play but they didn't get laid? yeah, Metallica sucks."
5,Metallica... Heavy and Frantic,"Many people might say that this Cd was a not as they would expect from the band who gave you great songs like One, Fade to black, Wherever I may roam, and Backened. But if people whould stop stating the fact that there is no solo from Kirk in any of the tracks and see that this Cd has some of the craziest songs that have every been produced. Like Frantic, Invisible kid, St. anger, Some kind of monster, and shoot me again are all what Metallica was meant to sound like and if people weren't stuck in the 80's (Even though that stuff is great) they would see that this album is strickly metal."
3,Snare = Annoying,"The snare is definitly the most annoying snare on the planet. I've gotten used to it, but this CD does not compare to anything like Master or Ride or Kill 'Em All or ...And Justice or the Black Album... So basically it doesn't compare to classic Metallica. It's just like the same song, but different enough to know them apart. Does that make sense? My favorite song is the one about shooting. Alright."
2,What were they thinking?,"This is a terrible album! It's hard to believe that Metallica would put out an album like this. I'm listening to it as I'm writing this review and it's probably the last time that I will. This album makes Load look like a masterpiece. I've been a big fan of Metallica since 1987, so I know what I'm talking about. Gone are the great days of Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning, and Master Of Puppets. These guys are lost and have an identity crisis. I hope that they don't play many songs from this album when I see them this summer!"
3,Metallica without Kirk,"A lot of expectations and hype definitelly did not help this album.Overall its very rythmic and heavy. Pretty good listen. It's one of those albums that grow on you with each listen. The first and the second tracks are my favourites.Honestly, i don't think I like Metallica without Kirk though. He's there, but he's totally slacking off on this album. Even if you watch the DVD. You'll see him actually playing rythms!!! Why is he not doing any solos ??? That was, in my humble opinion, the lowest point of this album. Moreover, it was a very significant one.Rob's a mighty bass player. Lars' drumming is excelent. I'm not sure how much I like James' lyrics yet. But my favourite horseman Kirk is just not there."
1,Forgetting your roots,"I can't even begin to explain my disappointment. Metallica is best known for their incredible solo's on every song. Yet this album has NOT ONE GUITAR SOLO. Each song follows the same formula: play the riff on bass for a few seconds, then play the same riff with guitar. And James' vocals are at their end. From the first song ""Frantic"" the man's running out of breath going ""tic tic tiiic tiiic tiiiiiiic tock"" Not worth the money. Heck, not even the download!!!!! You'd think after months of studio time, they'd make something good. But apparently not."
1,Metallica has gone down hill.,"I thought that Load and Reload was total crap; then I listened to this, and I found Metallica at a new low. The once greatest thrash metal band is about as bad as Dave Mustane's voice singing opera. This is a should not buy on any person's list who have loved Metallica before they played this trash."
1,Nothing to do with Metal,"A friend of mine bought this worthless piece of garbage and let me borrow it so I could hear what all the fuss was about. I have never been more appalled in all my life. This thing is so awful it almost makes me want to vomit in horror. The songs are bland and thrown together. There are no solos whatsoever, and the songs seem to be long for no good reason at all. Nothing on this album really goes anywhere. I gave it more than one spin and it certainly did not grow on me in the least bit. In fact everytime it only got more and more difficult to listen to. The last time I actually cut it off in the middle and just put it back in the case. The next day I gave it back to my friend. For anyone who desires real Metal, get anything from Decapitated, Naglfar, Setherial, Opeth or Iced Earth. Anything by any of those bands will be much more satisfying than this ""thing"" that some misguided poeple think is ""Metal""."
1,Awful..,"Unbelievably bad, is how I would describe this album. Six years since their last studio album (1997's ReLoad). I don't even honestly know where to start? I've been a fan for 17+ years. I liked everything up until 1996's Load album. After hearing this though, it makes Load sound good. The songs on this album are not memorable, to say the least (The title track is the only song I halfway like). The production is awful. The drum tracks are horrible (Lars sounds like he's playing a trash can). I've heard better quality recordings from demo tapes. The songs are way too long, and very repetitive. The lyrics are silly and unimaginative. And, last but certainly not least, there are no guitar solos anywhere to be found. Truly unbelievable. I am still in shock.."
2,no justice.,"the basic idea behind this album was good -- a raw, garage sounding record -- like they traveled back in time and were young, dirty potheads again. the only thing is that the songs aren't very good. i can't believe this is the same band that created the justice and masters albums. i think lars and the gang thought.. 'they're just going to download it free anyway, so why put the time into it.'"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I gotta tell you the first time i heard Metallica was when Master of Puppets came out and i loved that album and everything before it and a couple after it , metallica is a group of very talented guys that can really rock your heart out but instead of being them they change to get more radio play and to be on mtv more which is uncool to fans that enjoyed them for them they totally killed their talent on this cd honestly i just skimmed through it when i first bought it and then sold it for 5 bucks it sucks honestly if you wanna remember metallica in a good way buy Ride the Lightning , And Justice for all or Master Of Puppets ."
1,Poor poor Metallica,"These guys were the gods of heavey meatal (Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin being the Titans, obviously). They, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer set the stage for every nu-metal band around today.This CD is apoor example of Metallica's ability to play and write heavy metal. They converted their sound too many times now. This sound being the worst.They could do better."
1,Country Metal meets nursery rhymes.,"Dude, What is up Metallica? Why did you release this awful album. This is not Metallica. I am wondering if they wrote these songs in the shower together.OK, first off, A friend gave me this album(hint) because he didnt want it and Im like ""cool dude, the new METALLICA!"" I pop it in my Pioneer and turned up the volume. Pound Pound Pound Pound pound pound pound..is all I heard. The snare is monotonous and not entertaining at all and weak as hell. The music is zz-top-esque rock with rap rhymes. At this point my ears bleed with puss and I am searching through the music for the reason it exists and I am ready to take a bath now. Hetfields voice is absolutely atrocious. I think he actually cries on this album..or was that me? This band has no redeeming features for old fans like me...They just give birth to platinum coffee coasters and bunk trends."
1,i threw it out the window...,"After listening to the CD and laughing my ass off, I decided to chuck the whole package out the window. My little brother's Fisher Price drumset is more intense than Lars'. Better acoustics too.Buy a Hüsker Dü record instead."
1,sigh...,"OK, first I want to knod to the fact that I am not a *fan* of Metallica per se. I like Master of Puppets, and almost everything from it to the black album, but i am yet to dig something they did after that. I am more casually into metallica and I don't have patience for this and their less impressive work. So in my opinion, a one star effort in production. They should have used this a preliminary demo, then stopped butchering songs together, and recorded an album with a snare that doesn't dominate the songs with its horrible wretching sound...gasp...ok I'm done."
1,0 stars....negative in fact,"bands as good(formerly) as metallica have no place releasing trash like this. i dont understand why a band with the money to produce a cd well would take music that could possibly be good and record it, fine tune everything, and then make it sound like (expletive deleted) on purpose to cash in on the trend of ""stripped raw!"" production employed by black metal bands(not for style, simply because of monetary reasons). black metal works with bad production value because of the atmosphere of the music, metallica is a ""thrash metal"" band, not black metal, and thrash with crusty production sounds like $hit. this cd is metallicas greatest catastrophe since burtons death. for the 'tallica boys, pretend you never released this and move on to the next master of puppets....or retire and quit while your behind"
1,From AMAZING.......to nothing (good job),"As if load and re-load were not bad enough..........I agree with all the negative reviews and say that Metallica's last good album was the black album. They either need to wake the hell up or stop making music. I thank God that I did not buy this album, but rather burned it. If I bought it, I would probably kill myself. Bottom-line..Metallica has gone from the very best metal band in history................to possibly the worst. This album proves that. They don't even have any guitar solos, yet they have one of the best guitar players in metal music. Metallica's done. Do yourself a favor and save your money when considering this album. I CANNOT EVEN LISTEN TO THEIR OLD STUFF NOW, BECAUSE I'M SO PISSED!!!"
2,Warning !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Don't get me wrong I'm a huge Metallica fan but this CD was more than disipointing. I purchased this CD the first day it was in the stores. The first thing I did when I got home was take the wrapping of the horrible case. For some reason they made a little slip in the case where they slid the CD in. I took the cd out and it was horrible scratched. Buyer beware this might have happened to other CD's but it doesn't stop there. The songs were horrible compared to the songs on previous CD's. It was just thrown together with no thought put into it. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of the song unkown feeling which is a decent song. I dont recomend getting this CD.
1,A Total Disgrace!,"First off, I can't beleive how low Metallica has sunk to this level of tin-can bashing and vocals that sound like nothing else I've ever heard. They do not even sound like their older albums, with that power and grace and how we all have come to love that famous instrumental music. I would recommend Metallica's older albums, plus any of Linkin Park's cd's. At least they know what they were doing when they recorded their music!"
2,"Heavy, yet weak...","I've listened to this CD a few times and I think I've summed up what the problems with it are. First, and foremost, Lars' snare drum HAS to go. The ringing coming off of this drum is distracting and turns Metallica's normally clean sound into a muddled mess. Second, the guitars seem to be a bit muted. This is a guitar-heavy band. The sound of distorted guitars should blow you away. Yet it doesn't. This is VERY obvious in the opening of the song St. Anger. What should be a smash to the face is merely a tickle. In short, good songs, badly mixed. Let's just hope this is Metallica's last time with Bob Rock."
3,Lotsa noise,"A clear influence of the late Nirvana--otherwise a lot of noise and anger. It's the theme of the album, in any case; and they sure kept up with it. I still don't know what to make of it. They didn't seem like they really had fun recording this album. I don't think it's a masterpiece but it's certainly an interesting disc. No remorse, no compromises. Not even a guitar solo! I don't regret buying it but I can only recommend it to people who think ""Kill 'em all"" is a harmonious album."
2,That annoying snare drum sound kills this album!!!!!,"I love Metalica. I think they have been on a steady decline since Master Of Puppets. i was very excited to hear that Metalica was going to return to the Rocking hard and Heavy sounds of the past. I bought St. Anger and have tried to listen to it repatedly, It just doesn't work for me. I cringe everytime I i hear that god awful twing sound when Lars plays a snare beat. I think Lars is a great drummer but I can't take that sound. I wouldn't mind a guitar solo or two but that is not what kills this album. In anticipation of the flak from other reviewers, I am not stuck in the 80's I love allot of new bands and albums. I think Anthrax's new album maybe their best yet. I am sorely dissapointed at this ilk that Metalica has put forth"
1,Somebody want my copy for free?,"I listen the Cd again and again, I don't really understand how they could do something so poor after years of doing nothing new. In the past Metallica was original, goods lyrics and of course good music with a lot of rifts and imagination. This production is empty, the sound is so BAD!!!!!.In my opinion the bonus DVD is the best thing you can get if you decides to buy it. But guys, they should change the price."
1,A Sad Album From the Kings of Metal,"I have been a metallica fan since the release of their ""Kill Em All"" Album, and it is really sad how bad their new album ""St. Anger"" is. Yes, I too was excited when I heard this new album was going to be a return to the hard and brutal sound from Metallica of old. However, St. Anger is angry just for the sake of being angry. It is almost as if the boys of Metallica had to prove that they still are bad ... This album is basically eleven tracks that sound exactly the same. The intros are nearly identical for each song. Kirk's technical guitar playing is absent from the album. James' lyrics are mindless and horribly repetitive. Not to mention his vocals are absolutely terrible. In short, if this is the best album Metallica can release after a five year break then the appropriate question should be....Why even bother?"
2,Tired and worn out.,"St. Anger is monotonous and predictable. I was a huge Metallica fan, until Load came out. I bought Load and, like most Metallica fans, was disappointed. I listened to a few sample tracks of Reload and decided to not even buy it. So after the years of disappointment, I was glad to hear that Metallica was steering into a new and heavier direction. It's true, the bass lines and guitars are pretty heavy on this CD. But they are repetitive and unimpressive. Just because it is heavy doesn't mean it is good. But that's not the worst. The lyrics are outright bad, both in their content and delivery. I think Metallica is done. They need to fold up the tent and call it a career. And that doesn't mean they suck overall. The pre-Load stuff is still excellent and serves as a benchmark for the metal genre. But it appears that anything after the black album is just a misguided and futile attempt to regain their previous glory. Sorry to say it, but they are finished."
5,Nothing but awesome,"Welcome back Metallica! St. Anger is awesome! What a great comeback, and what a great bassist they have. Rob Trujillo sounds like he's always been a part of Metallica. You gotta get off your butts and buy St. Anger."
1,"If This Dosnt Signal Coming of the Appocolypse, Nothing Will","Thats right, this is the worst cd ever. What a quincidence, its also the worst band ever. But wait, they're not a band they're just a group of guys playing guitair solos. I would rather listen to Brand New by far, then listen to them. St.Anger is the worst song ever. Yep, it can't get any worse then this in the music industry. Who ever signed them is the stupidest man ever, god help him."
1,Metallica has been dead since the Black Album,DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES! METALLICA IS GETTING WORSE AND WORSE WITH EACH NEW ALBUM AND THEY ARE FAR TOO COMMERCIAL. LET'S HOPE METALLICA FINALLY RETIRES BECAUSE THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ANOTHER GOOD ALBUM FROM THIS BAND!
2,Extremely disappointed -- almost tossed out window,"For a regular band this CD may be decent, but for Metallica it [is very bad]. I bought this CD with great excitement and anticipation only to be let down by lame songs with no melody, no guitar solos, and James' stupid whining lyrics. I've even tried listening to the songs many, many times, thinking they'd grow on me. They did not. Frantic and St. Anger are decent, but the rest of the CD is horrible. I got so upset and irate that Metallica would produce something this [bad] that I almost threw it out my car window. Bottom line...this CD is like nothing Metallica has ever done -- it [is bad]. I'm a big fan and I'm so dissapointed it pisses me off...I can't beleive Metallica had the nerve to produce this CD. If I had to choose between St Anger and a Celine Dion CD to take to a deserted island, I'd have a tough decision to make."
3,WHAT THE HELL ???????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,If you are a Metallica fan like me and have been ever since 1987 then you are in for a rude awakening! Unlike other fans I didn't have a problem when the band changed their sound on the LOAD album because it was still heavy and it was still a good sound. Now they change their sound again and it [is bad]!!!! I waited so long for a new Metallica album and then I was blown away when it came out on June 5th instead of June 10th but when I got in my car to blast it I almost had a wreck! I thought I had just bought some...Nu Metal CD. Lars drum's sound like a kid's sears drum kit and I guess Kirk forgot how to play a solo. James must have sat down and wrote the lyrics in 2 hours I am so dissapointed in this new CD I don't know what to do. My advice to Metallica fans is to go and buy the new Anthrax(we've come for you all) CD instead because Anthrax hasn't forgot where they come from. I HATE so much to say this but it looks like Metallica is done.
2,They've lost it ... completely,"Ever since ""Load"" i've been expecting the return of the metal gods, and this time it is ... NOT!. There's nothing left of the extraordinary group that was Metallica (until the Black Album). All the false pretenses and new ""back to the roots"" pose that Metallica is getting these days, is a sad view of a group of talented musicians that walked the wrong road since ""Load"", and to be real, this is worse. I don't know if it's rock bottom, but i guess it must look like it. Total loss of solo guitar work (is Kirk still on the band?), a rude apocalyptic sound ( not because it is aggresive, just the sound of a dying band), terrible lyrics, a ver big disappointment. To save: the vocals i think, James' roar has improved. A record for all those ""fans"" that joined the group after the black album. (how are we missing you, Cliff). Hope for a better future"
2,"Not their best, at all",I was looking forward to St Anger since the hype was it was a return to their roots. I'm a big Hetfield fan but the vocals are weak and the lyrics aren't up to standard. Overall the songs lack depth. Is Kirk even playing on it???Lots of bass going on (which wouldn't be a bad thing if it was GOOD bass playing) and drums throughtout the cd but many of the songs sound repetitious with an end result more boring than anything that a fan would associate with Metallica.
2,This is barely metallica,"While the drums are excellent, there is little else to like about this cd. Apparently the new metallica isn't big on guitar solos, as you won't find any here. By far the worst aspect of the cd is the vocals. The lyrics are laughable (Invisible kid falling through the grid? c'mon guys, what were you thinking?) and strangely enunciated by hetfield. The songs are also overlong and wandering, occasionally so rambling its hard to tell where one song begins and ends. I had originally heard the album was going to bring the guys back to the days of ride the lightning, and having only moderatly enjoyed the load/reload albums i was up for something old school. But this is not ride the lightning. It is loud, and definetly raw, but that is where its similarity with lightning ends. I can only hope that this poor excuse for metallica does not contiue on past this release."
2,What Happened?,"The first track started off well. It rocked hard and brought me the anticipation that Metallica had gone back to their roots. Then the vocals came in, which took away the excitement of the song.The majority of the songs start out amazingly aggressive and hard. They build you up and get you pumped, then all of a sudden the excitement drops to a cheesy vocal attempt by Hetfield. I think Hetfield was better off using drugs and alcohol. His performance and musical creativity was a lot better when he was wasted. The drums are amazing, and always have been with Lars behind the drums. The guitar riffs are decent, but are empty in places.I feel that I was cheated with the purchase of this album, and can now fully understand why people would want to download an album off of the internet before they invest their money in music that is not up to par. Very disappointing. Definitely a weak attempt as a whole."
1,This is true crap rock!,"...only one song worth calling decentthat song is ""unnamed feeling""and it even is lacking in qualityin my opinion this was their sad try for mainstreamits horrible and pathetici thought when they picked up robert trujillo on bassthey'd go back to like the ""black album"" stylethis is just [bad]not worth the money..."
3,OLD METALLICA......PLEASE COME BACK!!,"The one cool thing about this band is they never change their style and attitude. This album is completely different than anything else they've ever created. I love hard rock like Deftones, Flaw, and Cold but I also love Metallica. They blend an old Ride the Lightning Metallica with some hard choppy new Metallica. True metal fans will love this album! Old Metallica fans might find it hard to listen to for a while. The hard choppy riffs and the extremely angry lyrics are a new style for Metallica. Overall it is a good album and it is one you should buy."
2,not an impressive comeback by the greatest metal band,"This album, for sure, is different than other 'tallica albums. But the lyrics are dull and the music sucks. I am not sure if I had too much expectation, being a hardcore metallica fan, but this album doesnt even come close to their other albums, barring [re]load. I am utterly disappointed by this album, but its just my opinion."
2,WHAT THE HELL?,"WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING? Did the band listen to this before they put it out? The production is horrible and the drums sound like tin cans.""Frantic"" & ""Some Kind Of Monster"" are worthy examples of what the mighty 'Tallica are capable of,and new Rager Robert Trujillo (formerly of Suicidal,Infectious Grooves&Ozzy)is hands down one the best bassists in metal today (and it shows on this disk).Question-where's Kirk on this disk?Kirk is one of the strong points of the band,and is sorely under used on this release.The disk is a sonic mess (just listen to the title track for proof),and the guys should have put a little more polish on these raw,unfocused tunes.Anybody looking for a much awaited return to the days of old will be sorely dissapointed.Buy the CD/DVD combo (if at all) for the DVD of the band doing rehearsal versions of the album - for completists only!"
5,You've Got To Love It!,"What you can expect from St. Anger:A snare drum that sounds more like an island style steel drum, the complete absence of solos-as we know them-, more of a pop lyrical style new to Metallica, an excellent DVD of the entire album played from their studio and a twenty-or-so page booklet.A guy at the local cd shop described the new sound as a mix of Alice in Chains and Meshugga, I can agree. This is a good comparison to Alice in chains-See Frantic, Shoot Me Again or Sweet Amber-and as for Meshugga, a very LITE Meshugga, I concur. Just don't try to compare it to the bands early thrash greatness. It's no Kill Em' All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets or And Justice for all but it's better than Load or ReLoad and I must say... I like it!"
2,What happened?,"I thought the CD was very repetitive. I'm a very very big Metallica fan and couldn't believe what I was hearing. It sounds as if they were going towards a harder heavier metal but just couldn't reach it. I'm lost for words. There's some interesting songs in here, but I love their old stuff and wish they'd go back to their roots. If you like Metallica go ahead and buy it. You may or may not like it. But I wasn't impressed. Next CD needs to be better."
1,Please Don't Bother,"With all the hype about this record's release I thought St. Anger would be a slam dunk. Well slam dunk it in the trash can. I'm one of the few that can appreciate Ride the Lightning AND Load/Reload. However, God Himself couldn't make me even tolerate this CD. Metallica can financially afford mistakes like this CD but it's too bad that they feel they need to play games with themselves and their audience. This record sounds like they intentionally wanted to irritate the listener. This Metallica fan is sadly disappointed. I'm sure you will be too."
1,Five years gone and this is the best they can do!,"This album is [garbage]. It has been compared to such classics as Master of Puppets and Ride The Lightning. To say that is to trash those albums. Metallica's music has never been about how fast or slow they played, but how great they sounded. This has got to be the worst disc they have ever signed their name to."
2,Hmm...smells like a pile of horse SH@T,"Ok, this is crap, worse then crap. The only saving grace is Hetfeild's vocals, and even then, yes it is worse then crap. There is even mistake's on this. Put on a good pair of headphones and forward to 2.20 Let it play and around 2.32 you will here a rythm guitar playing when it is not supposed to. Carless, just like this album"
2,"Alas, the end is near","I've been a Metallic fan since Ride the Lightning and, unfortunately, this album tells me that the band has definitely peaked. For me, their swan song was And Justice For All, although all subsequent albums had their moments.But this CD ... wow, what to say other than it's just not very good. The songs range from so-so to so-what. And the production values ... what the hell happened there? The entire CD sounds like they've recorded it during an impromptu jam session. Or worse, an early practice section for the new bassist. If you go back and listen to the production of Metallica's other albums, the difference is obvious. As a matter of fact, I have a hard time listening to St. Anger using my headphones because the production is so bad.Don't get me wrong, I'll always consider myself a Metallica fan and I'll continue to support the band, but it's getting harder and harder with each album."
1,What has happened..........?,"Given that I have a max of 1000 words to write this review, I think that there is only one word to sum up the latest outing for a band I regarded as 'awesome' from the first moment I heard them. That word I can't really use here so I'm going to substitute it for the more watershed friendly 'pants' instead. They sound bad. I mean really bad. The start of nearly every song has Lars just crashing on the drums, the lyrics are dire and no real rhythm ever seems to emerge. Normally when I get a new CD, I play it almost to death. I switched this off after one session. I tried again later that day, I guess out of desperation to really want to enjoy it, but still the same opinion. I played it to my mate (long time Metallica fan) and he appreciated me playing it. Luckily for him he's saved a tenner. I couldn't even swap it in Woolworths. As for the DVD - great, we can now watch how badly they hash this album up as well.Even Load was better than this."
3,"Music is hard, agressive, recording seems lousy","Been a Metallica fan for years. Didn't mind their departure from their older style to their newer style.While they are a good band and this new album is pretty good with agression, anger and well, Metallica like hate, the recording on this album seems lousy. Not coming from a musical background I dont know what goes into rocording an album, but in comparison to the new Godsmack or even an older Metallica cd, it would appear that this was recorded in someones garage last minute. It takes away from the music unfortunately.I believe they are still working with Elektra, but somehow this recording job just sounds too sloppy.Overall not a bad buy, but a little letdown that the recording is so bad.Also, you have to respect a bands desire to expore new music styles as not everyone cares to hear the same style of music for over 15 years. Change can be a good thing."
2,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!,"What happend to my favorite aggresive speed metal band!????? Just look back to Kill em' all, how great that album is then show about 20 years later and this.-Drums are terrible.- James dosen't have his signature scream-NO SOLOS FROM KIRK!!!!!!!!!!! what!???? one of the greatest metal guitarists ever!! and no solosI still give them 3 stars because they are Metallica and i have soo much respeect for them"
2,quit disappointing!,"the big rumor surrounding the ""work"" was that Metallica was going back to their roots. They didn't go back far enough. This sounds like an aggrassive Load. No guitar solos. The lyrics stink. The music is ok. But that's it."
2,Metallica phones it in....the [horror!!!],"I have been a Metallica fan for many, many years, and have stuck with the excellent changes in style that this wonderfully gifted group has produced over that span of time. This, however, is not a good album. Yes, its fast. Yes, its hard. It also sounds like many hard rock and metal bands from the eighties and nineties that are no longer with us. For a reason. They made crap rock that sounded as if one night in the studio drinking with your buddies is all it takes to hammer out an album. To those of you thinking of buying this album, save your money. Listen to some Ride the Lightning, Justice, Load, etc., and remember those wistful days when Metallica not only rocked, but made the kind of music that has kept them on top for 20 years."
3,eh.....,"when i heard that this cd was ""just like their old [*]"" i got very interested in it, upon first time listening to it, i thought, ""wow, yeah, old stuff, if you consider Load their old stuff (and any self respecting metal fan knows exactly how much of a LOAD that was)"" i listened to it a little more, and i realized something, no, its not like their old stuff, its a different beast all together. firstly, even though i know im a dying breed, i like solos. it gives the artists a chance to show they know more than just the riffs that follow the song, it shows that they are true artists. now, i didnt hear the whole cd, i couldnt do it, but i read in another review about the fact that there are none. that makes me sad. its nothing great, its not terrible (better than the load duo), but i dont think ill actually go out and buy it. ill save my money and buy the new In Flames cd that i still havent gotten around to buying"
1,This album is awful or /getting their just-desserts..,It only seems fair that these mega-millionaire musicians get such bad reviews after they shut down Napster so us fans couldn't share their music. After this album I'll NEVER want to share a Metallica CD again. Time to retire boys. Take your millions and move to an island so those of us who enjoy good music don't have to deal with you anymore.
1,What the f**k?,"This, THIS is what we've waited for? Metallica are a disgrace. If they want to prove how METAL they are, I dare them to take Slayer on tour as an opening band with them. But they won't and you know why? Because the CRAP on this album doesn't measure up. Slayer and their fans will kick Metallica fans ASSES...especially if Slayer does all of Reign in Blood like they have been recently. All the Metallica fans who like this are wimps and I dare them to pick up any of Slayer's records...God Hates Us All is a mean evil record released on Sept 11...now THAT is an example of what metal should be. F**k Metallica...go back to your stupid group therapy...Metallica is DEAD!"
1,Don't... Just don't.,"I've lived with this album since the day it came out, and have tried repeatedly over the years to like it. You know what? I shouldn't have to try this hard. This album blows. The drums sound like coffee cans. The band needs a bass player to anchor them, and they didn't have one. There isn't one good song on here. Not one. Now that Death Magnetic is out, we can put the nightmare of St. Anger behind us. Hopefully all of these songs will be dropped from the live set list."
1,"Literally, more ""trash"" music from metallica!!","The sound is horrible, the voice of james is a torture, the guitar solos, where are they? (please, leave the lack of solos in the music to Korn). A waste of money!!"
1,"Horrible! Bad drums, vocals, rythm, YUK!","I've given this several listens to try to get into it, but I can't. I'm sorry to say, this is one of the worst albums I've listened to...and I have 100's. Lars drums are horrible...the tinny sound, the erratic tempo changes. James lyrics and voice are bad too. Where are the guitar solos? Why can't I hear the bass? Why isn't there ANY rythm or melody?Save your money people."
1,Metallica is SO 1980's,"This album is horrible. It goes against everything Metallica stood for. Albums before Load were almost orchestrated and there was alot of thought behind how the beats and rythms came together. Even after the Black album there were some redeeming qualities, and the spirit of Metallica was still there. This is utter trash. My brother's garage band sounds better than this! And to the people who say that thrash Metal and old school metal is not for this day and age, go buy some In Flames or Shadows Fall. Try out Trivium. In fact, go to All these bands could whip current Metallica around the block in pure musical talent. In fact, go to www.nuclearblastusa.com and check out some more of the bands on that label. Most of them are not from the states, and that's a good thing."
1,Bamboozled,"This is the last time I buy a CD without listening to it. Been a fan of Metallica's since And Justice For All. Loved all the early stuff and Black, liked Load, Reload, and even Garage. I hated St. Anger. Hated its psycho babble lyrics. Hated the drumming (I read some other review describing how Lars sounds like he is playing tin cans. He's exactly right. The drums he used have a really annoying tinny sound.)I just saw their Some Kind of Monster on VH1 last night, which chronicled the making of this album and prompted me to write this review. I have the CD another try, but it is truly unlistenable (is that a word?)."
3,Waste of money,"I (like many other Metallica fans) was horrified when i first heard this album. However I couldn't help but give the album a chance. And in all honestly if you give St. Anger a chance its a decent album.. It's got some good moments on it. I'm a hardcore Justice and Puppets fan and I know that Metallica has changed and wont go back to that style but i still know that St. Anger is not up to their capabilities. Metallica wonders why their album sales have dropped but the answer is in the albums they have been putting out. No, the albums aren't trash but I mean honestly who wants to drop 20$ for a mediocre album. People would much rather download the few decent songs. If Metallica wants record sales they need to make a record thats up to their potential. I dont expect another masterpeice like Master of Puppets but I still expect a record that is worth buying for more than 3 or 4 songs. They have failed to do that since Load."
4,"Once again, Metallica is different (and great!!!)","Yes, Metallica is about controversy, but most importantly, it is about change. The music in St. Anger is different from all the recent albums as the band seems to be trying to revert to the older, faster and harder music. It is definitely good and worth owning if you are a true fan.My favorite is track #4, Dirty Window. However, the best part of this set is the bonus DVD with the studio rehearsals."
1,Absolutely Horribly pathetic! 0 stars,"I have been a fan of Metallica since Justice. Their first 4 albums are good thrash metal...but after Cliff Burton died, Metallica died. They suck more than any band in the world now. They should have changed their name when they did that poor mainstream rock ""Black album"". This St Anger album is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever had the displeasure of listening to. It's horrible. I can make farting sounds that are more musical than St Anger. Kirk can't play guitar anymore, he's a sissy. James might as well shoot himself, he doesn't have any talent as a singer(and he never did). Lars is a little whiny b*tch. I don't even play drums and I can play better than him. It sounds like he used trash cans as drums for St Anger. Totally a waste of time and money on this album. Do your self a favor and use your money to blow your nose instead of buying this album. And for my closing statement, METALLICA SUCKS!!!!!"
1,- 10 star!,"this album is a jokeis not even better then garage underground punk bandno solos,crapy drum snare ,crapy vocal, bad sound production, repeatitive riff and lyrics.now i know why they put alot of bonus like dvd , download stuff etc because themselves not sure that this album is qualify as real metal albumyou guys better find other metal stuff to buy like iron maiden,megadeth or testamentthis is completely crap"
4,People change so do bands,"The funny thing is everyone expects Metallica to be like they were in the old days. Well guess what? They've changed which means the music changes. You can't judge a band or it's music without looking at what points the members are in their lives. In rock and roll years they're old men. They have kids now and James Hetfield just came out of rehab. You really expect to get another MOP or AJFA? Nope, never will. Get used to it. You ever stop to think that maybe they don't want to make another album like their old stuff? Maybe they want to do different things? Boo hoo if they didn't call you first and ask what kind of record they should make. This is a really metal good album."
1,Never Buy the Rehab album,"Every time a leading member of a band goes into rehab and comes out and does an album, you know it is going to suck. That has to be the only logical explanation for this latest Metallica installment.I am not sure if they were trying to create a buzz or just try something new to be labeled innovative, but they only succeeded in alienating much of their existing fan base and knocking down their legnedary status amongst the HeadBanger greats.It reminds me of Michael Jordans Washington Wizards come back. Should not have happened.I think most would agree that Metallica has done nothing really meaningful in terms of new music since the Black Album.My advice to Metallica, drop Bob Rock, listen to the songs that made you great and go back into the studio and make an album for your fans. I have been a fan since 1984 and continue to be hopeful, but after St. Anger I have my doubts."
4,HELLOOOO people it's 2003!,"It seems that most of the people that have reviewed this CD are stuck in a time warp. WAKE UP - it is no longer the 80's people, it's 2003! These same people probably still wear acid washed jeans, old faded master of puppets t-shirts, and still drive 80s firebirds/camaros!! This is a band that has evolved, grown up, and moved on with the times. A good band can do that. Who wants to listen to the same old stuff day in and day out??? NOT ME! If that is you then don't waste your money - just stay home and listen to your old Master of Puppets record or tape for the millionth time!"
1,"Tic Tic Tic Tock, Time To Break Up","This is exactly what I expected, Bought it on June 5th day before it came out. WOW! I would rather listen to pop-punk. Now i think thats pushing it but is along these lines. I own every single Metallica album. EVERY ONE. The greatness and the wesuckness I have it all. And this is the worst album of 2003 and 2004 and 2005. I am positive. It is sad that this is the same band that put out the Black Album. They just stopped trying. I still respect them though, Because of their accomplishments so many years ago. The best song is #2 which is kind of annoying because of the repetitiveness of it. This is not real metal . This is an album put out to continue the flow of money as their popularity increases in the mainstream. But to me if a band has a video played on MTV they are bound to suck within the next album. Sorry guys your time is over."
1,"Bob Rock, what have you done to these guys?!!!","I mean, other than making them rich, why are you helping to destroy them forever? Are you some kind of sorcerer, that hypnotized them to make such useless albums? I agree that St. Anger is not commercial at all. Why? It can not be commercial, because the album simply IS NOT AN ALBUM! Maybe to attend a limit date of release, they put together this terrible thing. Why would a producer lead a band (or accept their orders)to go into such a direction? Of course he will get his royalties no matter what crap the band releases (I hear it sold more than one million copies already worldwide. A honest producer, one in real friendship with the guys from a band, would never let them release such crap.Shame on you, Bob Rock. Shame on you, Kirk, for quiting soloing (not that your solos were ever even close to brilliance). Shame on you, greedy Lar$."
1,"Invisible Kid is the ""best"" song ever","""Invisible kidNever see what he didGot stuck where he hidFallen through the gridInvisible kidGot a place of his ownWhere he'll never be knownInward he's grownInvisible kidLocked away in his brainFrom the shame and the painWorld down the drainInvisible kidSuspicious of your touchDon't want no crutchBut it's all too much""Thank you Metallica for creating such a fine piece of ""work."" Someone kill me now."
1,Not good,"To sum it up...terrible. As a long time listener and fan of Metallica, I can say this album didn't have anything on it that was good to listen to. The days of ""fade to black"" and ""enter sandman"" are over for the band. I found this album to be more noise and all the tracks to be very similar and boring."
1,They really Angered their fans with this!!!,"This album deserves to be banned. If anyone is found playing St. Anger, they should be prosecuted and put on trial. Listening to even one song from this load of crap is harassing. Dont get me wrong, Metallica is one of all time fave bands. I have listened to a lot of crazy, wierd crappy metal and this is one of them. At least they are true to what they believe. Metallica has no direction in this album. They just go off playing dissonant riffs over and over in every song. Its a shame I have enjoyed Britney Spears albums when compared to this one.Highlight: Gives you another reason to hate Lars Ulrich.ps: Lars, if you read this, no matter what you say about St.Anger...it still sucks. I'm madly in anger with you, James, Kirk and Bob Rock."
1,God why did I bother....,"I finally got Metallica's St. Anger... and I really *hoped* the reviews I read on Amazon and on the Usenet Newsgroups were just overly harsh...They weren't...I mean.. DANG this thing is a turd. The mix and sound are horrible.. The guitars clip constantly and the sound is so oversaturated that even if the material were *good* it would be unlistenable...Note to Lars and James: ""KILL KILL KILL KILL"" is NOT a lyric - you dopes!!On a scale of one to five stars I give it a big fat ZERO."
1,The Thing That Should Have Never Been,"I am very sad. Very very sad. At first, I thought Metallica was going to return to thier roots and rock harder than ever. Instead, they recorded an album that sounds worse than my 4-track cassette demos that were water damaged. WHAT GIVES?That drum sound is horrid. The snare rings hideously. I can appreciate the tuned down approach but give me a friggin break! Not one guitar solo, Jame's voice sounds so unenthuzed. It's no wonder Jason Newstead bailed from this unit of what was a once great band. I am afraid that they failed miserably in thier attempt to rediscover themselves. This must be the end of Metallic.....uh!"
1,St. Bollocks,What happened?Has $ellouticA finally put an end to their miserable career? Has Lar$ decided to hit trashcans instead of an actualy drumkit? And Kirk... what a waste.I saw one little fanboy saying that this is a return to heavy metal. WRONG. this sounds like limp bizkit. i couldnt even believe who tallica decided to bring on their sanitarium tour. linkin park? deftones? mudvayne? and freddy d in a baseball cap?Give it up you $ellouts.
1,The Worst CD Ever Made In The History Of Music,"Between them suing their own fans , Becoming MTV Puppets , Touring with the most recent ""in"" bands , Newsted quitting , Bob Rock playing bass on the new record , Getting a gorilla to replace Newsted , Hammett not playing leads , Lars playing on trash cans , James singing like a whining idiot , almost all of their fan base old and new bashing this record , every person I know hating them now , being made fun of on South Park , and them releasing a album that has zero production and zero talent, I think it's safe to say that Metallica are finished soon ! Let's all celebrate by boycotting everthing this band has done and stands for ! Greed, vanity, and ignorance could not be put together into one band so well as it has been done with Metallica ! Congratulations boy's you are offically the most hated band in America !!!"
1,Where is Metallica??,"I don't know who this band was but it was not Metallica. The singing was terrible, I don't think Kirk was playing the guitar, and the songwriting was just plain horrible. If you like Metallica, from kill them all to the black album, you will hate this CD and want to throw it against the wall. If you liked Load and REload, you might rate it a 2. But album is terrible. There is not one good thing to say about it. It is a shame to think it took them this long to put out [material] like this. Megadeth has passed Metallica bye, by at least putting out albums that have some musical value. I don't know what Metallica was thinking when they heard this CD in the studio and deceided to release this. I would have rather them put out another box set."
1,What ..happened here?,"I wanted to like this record but I just can't. The production is horrible, the lyrics are all [bad] twelve stepper stuff and the arrangements while fast and complex feel forced together without any real cohesion. This sounds like a band in crisis trying way too hard to re-capture their youth."
1,ARGH! My ears hurt!,"I was waiting for this, the day when Metallica died. This album is the biggest rubbish ever!First, there is no solo's and what happened to James Hetfeild his voice on Frantic's verse makes me laugh.St. Anger is a fair track but the rest of it is rubbish.The reason is because when metallica where making this they wernt getting along you will know what i mean when there movie Some Kind Of Monster comes out And just to make it better they give u a bonus DVD! Oh i am so excited! PLEASE PLEASE Do not buy this!"
1,St. Angry for spending money on this garbage!,"If it wasn't Metallica recording this, nobody would have bought it and it would have never been played. This is the worst BS I have ever heard. Must have been inspired from prison sex or something. Good news is that Lar$ won't have to worry about people downloading this crap!"
1,Plain Out SUCKS!,"Metallica used to carry the best sound of all throughout the Metal world. Listen to St. Anger once and it'll change your mind pretty damn fast. The sound of the drums are so different now you couldn't even recognize if it was Lars playing or not. Stop feeding these greedy bastards your money, because this album isn't worth the sh*t off the ground."
2,Try something else,"I burned the CD from a friend. I haven't listened to Metallica much of Metallica, just a couple of their old ones and the black album, so I didn't know what to expect from this CD. Geez it sounds horrible. It's probably the worst CD in my collection.That's all I can say about it, unfortunately; just ""horrible."" IF you're new to Metallica try buying one of their ""older"" ones (i.e. the ones before the black album) instead of this one. Or heck, if you have an open mind the black album is terrific too!"
2,Worst Metallica Ever,"Take it from me, im one of metallica's biggest fans, however this album is a huge disappointment to me. To be honest, i preferred Load and Reload to this. There's no break through song, the lyrics are horrible and there was nothing from Hammet. Metallica has picked up the habits of new day metal. If you buy it, but it to complete your metallica collection"
1,What were they thinking?,"Metallica went down, they use to be so well back in the days. Why?1. They are known as one of the best metal bands.2. They made headbanging popular and a sport to many headbangers.3. They had well written lyrics, whenever you were mad you use to be able to blast Metallica and get rid of all the anger inside of us.4. Metallica was never on MTV back in the day. Now they just are and its not so well written. When they cut their hair, many headbangers were pissed off cause Metallica were known for headbanging now without their hair no one knows what to say."
1,This is Trash.....,This album is garbage.... Just a pile of junk. Why did they put out this? It sounds like a bunch of trash. Metallica is way past its prime... and its going to be tough for them to get back in a groove.
4,Online Stuff Worth the Price,"This new Metallica sound seems muddy and not particularly hard-hitting. I get the sense from the cover art and from the thrashey sound that this is an attempt to return to Metallica's roots. I don't think they succeeded, but it will be interesting to see where they take it.That said, buying this CD will give you access to about 18 128KBps MP3s from live shows over the years. Listening to this stuff was like opening the Black Album or Ride the Lightning again for the first time. At least back in the day, these guys rocked."
1,where is metallica i know,(I love the cover art PUSHEAD YOU RULE!!)but i miss the metallica i know but then again every band is intitled to a bad album and this is it.but they still will forever remain my favorite band.and James Hetfield is still my idol.and is Kirk on this album
1,SO DISSAPOINTED,"I HATE TO SAY IT BUT THIS GUYS SHOULD RETIRE IF ALL THERE NEXT ALBUMS SOUND LIKE THIS. ONLY SING I LIKE SOME WHAT IS ""FRANTIC""."
2,I don't get the drums sound....,"Putting aside all the criticism for a while, just one question does not get out of my mind concerning St.Anger: Why on Earth did Lars used that tin can sound to his drums???!! I just don't understand it! Why??! This incredible flaw, alone, killed half of the quality this album could have..."
4,R U Angry?,"If you are you should love this album. You can feel the anger when you listen to it. I think that's what they intended. I love guitar solos and their old stuff as much as any devoted Metallica fan. However this album, after listening to it many times has really grown on me especially Invisable Kid, Sweet Amber and The Unnamed Feeling. It's remained in my car's cd player for over a month. If you wanna 'bang your head' this is the album to do it to. It rocks and rocks hard. I will admit however that none of my friends or relatives share my opinion. If I want my wife or friends to go away I just pop in St Anger. Obviously not everyone is going to like this type of hard rock. Due to the fact that I love guitar solos so much I withheld one star in my four star rating. Come on Metallica you fell just short of a perfect album. (Just my opinion :-) P.S. If you want awesome guitar solos buy Fate's Warning ""No Exit"" CD."
4,"This raw, heavy piece of art is getting a bum wrap!","I have been a Metallica fan from the beginning and I will say I had slightly mixed emotions about this album at first. Just the same way I did when the black album followed up ""...And Justice For All."" But just because the style shifted some is no reason not to appreciate the excellence of these albums (Black album & St. Anger).This album is a transition of the life of the entire Metallica family. This album is as compelling as Staind's ""14 Shades of Grey."" The depth of lyrics are more than the pure angst of ""Am I Evil?"" but still just as raw.This album has the speed and heaviness of the early Slayer albums and the gut wrenching riffs and howling vocals of Iron Maiden. For any true Metallica fan and metal head, this album is a must for the collection.This is a new side of Metallica that some people just can't grasp yet, but will eventually connect with. Between the heavy sounds, deep lyrics, and retro-metal feel, this album is a true classic."
3,Major Let Down From Metallica,"This is the worst album of Metallica's career. It is overall a so-so effort from this band. I have all of their cd's. When I first heard the single ""St. Anger"" on the radio. I didn't immediately recognize it as being by Metallica. The cd is very experimental to say the least. If Metallica intend on continuing in this musical direction, they are in trouble! It is really weird to hear Kirk Hammett not play a single lead solo on this whole cd!However, some of the tracks that stand out are Frantic, Some Kind of Monster, My World and Purify. This album isn't awful. However, I expect better from these guys. It's easy to see why Guitar World and Revolver magazine readers recently voted this one of the five worst albums of 2003.The fans are overall disappointed in this cd including myself. I hope Metallica will wake up on the next album and go back to their early roots from the Kill'em All years up to the Black album. This is when Metallica were at their best!"
4,Pretty Good Album,"OK, I will admit that this is not the best Metallica album ever, but let's put things into perspective: the black album was their best album, and that was one of THE best albums of all time, EVER!!!! You really think they could do something like that AGAIN?! We all go through our prime stages, and Metallica have done just that. I have all of Metallica's albums, and I reckon that any album they will ever release will be of at least a decent standard; again, St Anger is such a record. The vocals are awesome, the guitars are punishing, the bass is pounding, and the drums...hell yeah! The sounds of the drums are like the sound when I smash beer cans when I wear St Anger round my neck! This represents real anger, not the fake anger of Linkin Park...right now, I need to set my anger free....SET IT FREE!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as bad as people say but not Metallica,"The people trashing this album are missing one small fact: the bassist changed (a former member of the Suicidal Tendencies) and with it, the band changed their approach and material. This isn't new: they did the exact same thing when Cliff Burton died. The Jason Newstead era does not resemble the Cliff era Metallica but that's ok...it was different but still enjoyable. This album isn't stellar...in fact, it can be downright redundant and there are no guitar solos anywhere but again, they were trying to incorporate a more skate-punk approach which they generally managed to do. The drums do sound raw and hollow but then it's a semi-garage album. If a different bad put out this material (like Godsmack) they'd be revered. I give it a 3...it doesn't stand up to the raw speed and genius of early Metallica; but it's not their worst album either (you have Reload holding that honor)."
1,Alchlholica was better,Wow this is just awful. its so mainstream and simple. Metallica was way better when they were all drunks in the 80's playing thrash.
1,Resualts May Vary,"Let's see...I hate this and would rather listen to a John Denver Christmas album than have to listen to this travisity of a mockery of a sham that sounds as if it was recorded on an answering machine, so I give it the lowest rating possible: 1 star. Do not buy this unless you like listening to repetitive garbage that includes: James's worse vocals...ever, a drum kit that sounds like it was made from trash cans and lids, absolutely ZERO (0) guitar solos, mindblowingly lame and simple lyrics (thanks Lars), and songs that sound like the track is skipping, I mean that the riffs and lyrics repeat so much that it sounds as if the tracks are looped or skipping. So yeah, this is pretty bad by my book."
1,Worst Album Ever!,"This album is beyond bad. If a new band were to release this monstrosity I would still hate it, but the fact that the once mighty Metallica fell from grace and created this mistake, makes it more unbearable. There is no flow to the album, most of the songs are so poorly written and mixed that there is no distinguishable trace of rythmn, tone, melody or innovation. It mainly sounds like a wall of dank sound, with no logical connection between song and the unbelievably poor lyrics. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this album!"
2,where did they go,"On the dvd 'metallica some kind of monster' somebody asks Lars ""after twenty years is it posible to retain the fire that you guys once had at the begining?"" and to save you buying this album to find out the arnser it is NO! the album dos'nt have the same impact as the albums before.There are no guitar solos and at some points Lars sounds like he is hiting tin cans insted of drums.On a brigther note there are some some songs that have some good riffs like some kind of monster but overall I think this album is a big disapointment!"
3,Not bad,"This album musically is great but Hetfield's vocals aren't cutting it this time around. Some times he sounds fine, and other times I am just like who the hell is this. This CD isn't like any of the older metallica cd's, it's definately heavier then the more recent material but doesn't have the passion of the first albums. And I want to know who was the guy calling the shots to take out guitar solo's??? That kinda sucked."
4,The Sound and the Fury,"After 6 years without a studio album, Metallica's ""St. Anger"" is a testament to the evolution of metal's most famous band. Darker and deeper than any previously released album, it burns through 11 tracks at a remarkably fast rate and thrashes with some insane riffs. Hopefully, if they've done their job right, you won't notice that there are no solos. Although certain sections of the album sound like nu-metal, the album is something distinctly different. Definitely Heavy Metal for the new century."
1,this cd sucks,"hey guys it's cozzy, yet again. Metallica better do better on the new album they're going to make with rick ruben cause if they don't they lost themselves a fan."
1,What happened?,Someone has kidnapped my favorite metal band and replaced them with some bad high school garage band! If this is what Bob Rock brings to the table then boys please pitch him now!
3,At least it was good for something.,"I love Metallica, and I truly gave this album a chance, I like 2 songs, Frantic & St. Anger but the rest of it was hard to listen to.I did find someone who absolutely loved it though.. my son.. he is 3 months old now but when St. Anger came out, he had colic so bad I almost lost my mind. I played the free St. Anger DVD during one of his screaming sesions, and all of a sudden it got quiet. Nothing else stopped this kid from screaming except the vacuum. Now we play it in the car when he is screaming and it gets quiet real fast. Maybe it sounds like 'white noise' to him or something.. no idea.. but they at least have one fan and a happy mom.(just until he is over this colicky period anyway, after that we will move on to the kiddie music)"
2,Is some aweful band trying to mimic Metallica!?,"Indeed, is someone trying to mimic Metallica!? Oh wait. No. My mistake. This IS Metallica. At least it USE to be Metallica. The only reason I gave a second star is because some of the songs have different than usual subject matter. Other then that, Saint Anger sucks so bad its like a bunch of hungry piglets cannot get their food because their mother was butchered by the local farmering community for amusement. Well I am not amused. We Metallica fans got jipped big time. And to think the DVD bonus was suppose to make up for the cannon fodder music. Nevertheless, I shall keep this album as a reminder to do more reviewing before I buy. This album does not belong in retail."
5,"Great CD, Give it a chance!","I don't understand why people don't seem to like this cd. It seemed like everyone wanted Metallica to go back to playing faster, heavier music which they have done with this cd. Yes, there aren't any long extended solos and there is a lot of snare drum, but if you listen more than once, it will grow on you. I listen to this cd all the time. The playing is fast and furious and I love it. Give it a chance people! It's good to learn to like different Metallica cds not just their old ones. They are still an awesome band!!"
2,Lame CD,"Metallica's new CD is a real stinker. It's a shame because after the Black Album each album afterwards has gotten progressively worse. This album is a new low. James Hetfield's voice sounds terrible, it is so bad that it actually distracts you from the rest of the music. If you hear the first song you will see what I mean. Here is a small sample: FRANTIC, TICK, TICK,TICK, TICK, TICK, TICK TOCK. I love Metallica and I keep hoping the more I listen to ST Anger the more I'll like it, that hasn't happened yet and I doubt it will. I am going to the Sanitarium Tour this summer and I hope they do not play anything from their new album."
3,Could have been better.,"OK, so first off I have to admit I was disapointed with the album when I first heard it, but after a few listens(and watching the Documentary: Some Kind of Monster), it began to grow on me. I was still missing the intense solos....and the drums that didnt sound like tin cans, but it grew on me alot. This album is the equivalent of load/reload. I hope that metallica will go back to what works best for them...."
3,Yeah ok whatever!!,"Yes it's Metallica and yes it has it's moments, but what the hell where they thinking when they recorded this? It sounds god awful period. Yes it's raw and has a live feel I guess, but holy crap live in Jims basement under the stairs near the hot water tank in front of the furnace doesn't mean good does it? The drum sound is just obnoxious and the songs in general are far to long. If you love Metallica buy it, if you don't, you're not missing much here.They get a bonus star for tossing in the dvd which sounds better by the way?"
1,You Gotta Be Kidding Me,"I just reviewed Ride The Lightning, but I also just saw a review on the Ride The Lighning page from some loser who said St. Anger was better than Ride The Lightning. I think I am going to VOMIT WITH HORRIBLE RAGE. St. Anger is Mettalica's worste album. St. Anger was one of the crappiest pieces of crap I have ever heard. It sickens me that some posers like him who think they are cool get St. Anger and then start walkin around sayin they are the biggest Metallica fans and stuff. Dont even try to pull that shiz-nit. YOU FREAKIN POSER. So in conclusion, Ride The Lightning = BEST. St. Anger = WORSTE. Thank you everybody else for not being a poser."
2,Mediocre bullcrap.Why buy this?,This is by far the worst album Ive ever listened to except maybe for that Spin Doctors cd I bought back in 93 or some time like that.Yep I may have been spoiled by Master Of Puppets and the Black Album but still anyone with any musical taste at all can see that this album sucks a lot.I think its pathetic that any band can release an album this awful can get away with it and not feel ashamed.I actually liked the Load albums a lot because the well known songs on it were really good but it seems that nothing really stands out on this one.Its awful.Please do not buy this.
4,"Not Their Roots, But Not Too Bad","I picked this CD up yesterday and have listened through it a couple times. I'm a die-hard Metallica fan and have been since their early days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. They've definitely picked up the speed again which is a sign of their original roots and what made them one of the premier metal bands in the world. The music does take some getting used to, and it will surely grow on you as you listen. Don't expect old school Metallica, however the new sound is quite unique. More Hammett riffs and solos would have been nice as well as a few hooks here and there, but hey, this is Metallica and they can't be touched. Check out the included DVD. This was phenomenal to watch them record the entire album in the studio, in order of the songs on the CD. Great buy, but I just can't find it in me to give 5 stars. Pick it up though....you're sure to enjoy the new sounds of the greatest metal band ever....METALLICA!!"
1,a fall from grace - should be 0 the almighty mettalica have fallen,this poor in my mind from just about anyones standard its not just the fact kirk dosnt play solos any more i dont find that a problem james voice seems to have deteriated it lacks imagination just grinding nu metal witch is a term i should never use to describe metallica no solos no melody and i loved the ballads any fans should stay clear unless they have to own everything metallica have ever recorded
1,PEOPLE WHO HATE THIS CD UNITE !!!!!,"This CD is the worst and you all know it. People who don't give it a bad review are in denial...they are so in love with Lars that they can't bear to speak badly of this horrible, terrible, disgusting attempt at music...Any one who gives this CD more than one star is too afraid of the truth that Metallica now SUCK that they continue to defend them. They can all go choke on Lars bank account !!!! Die Fools !!!!"
1,MAKES ME WANT TO KILL EVERY ONE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This record bad... real bad... buy used copy and throw at metallicrap... band now pretentious morons... once good... now really bad... I hate them... I hate all reviews above 1 star here... why won't the overall review drop below three stars... please help and wright a 1 star review... Only together we can get the overall down to 1 star... Then we laugh... Then we sue Lars for our money back... Then we stop spending money on this horrible band that has sucked up hundreds of $ from all of us ! Screw this band ! They are the lowest of the low ! They hate their fans and laugh at them from their ivory tower ! Throw stuff at them if you see them !!
2,oh boy...,"I think that there's a possibility that these guys aren't 100% serious about this project. This is not a real Metallica album. It can't be, and I'm not overexaggerating here. I bet, what this recording is, is a bunch of pre-Kill 'Em All garage recordings that have been (for some reason) released on a new LP. This reminds me of a bunch of kids just messing around. The quality of the music, the effort, the talent? It's all very low and poor. The singles are good (they stand out at least), don't get me wrong. ""St. Anger"" the song and video are wicked, and so is ""Frantic"" and a couple other songs.... but the rest is very long, boring, talentless and just Not Metallica. The DVD is great, actually. But only because you can see that the band is having a good time, and they're very much in sync, and it's great to watch them jam. But um... nice try Metallica - please work harder next time around, alright? I know it's probably been a long 20 years but Come On!!!"
1,St. Awful...,"A better title for this album would be, ""St. Awful,"" or ""St. Average"" at best. Metallica attempts to sound like so many of the bands that they are currently on tour with and the ones that populate the airwaves right now. While it might be trendy to do this and sound more current, the album is just dreadful. It's eerily reminiscent of when the 80's Hair Bands attempted to sound like Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, you name it. If they stick with their roots, the fans will be happier in the long run."
1,I wish I could give it no stars,First off I not a kid I'm 34.I just don't like to give out my Email address.I was a MetalicaT for years I really don't know what went wrong with them.But I glad to see that Jason got out when he did.This album has earned its place in the HALL OF SHAME.The production sounds worse than some single microphone tape recorders.The guitars are sloppy and the drums are absolutely horrible.I hope they can redeem themselves because this album is just plain horrible .James' sounds if though he is really straining to get out what used come very natural for him .
1,Insufferable & unlistenable,"While I'm not a big Metallica fan, some of their earlier stuff has some merit but this is absolutely awful!!! The most offensive and glarringly obvious defect is the HORRIBLE sounding drums!!! What were they thinking? That in and of itself makes the whole album sound the same and totally one dimensional. The production is also quite dry and the overall sound is quite sterile. I don't know if anyone knows this but lead guitarists are not extinct (indangered maybe) and with their tenure I think some solos would not drastically harm album sales. I tried to like it but it is one of the most grating annoying unlistenable albums I've ever heard."
1,Extremely large disappointment,"The snare sound that Lars uses, the lack of any really memorable riffs, the lack of flow to the songs, the ""Now with more juvenile lyrics!"" feature, and the random thrashing that just sounds like a pile of garbage basically make me not want to listen to St. Anger, ever. I own every previous Metallica CD and they're one of my favorite bands. I have honestly listened to the songs on this album over and over and they just never stop sounding like garbage. I don't recommend this album to anyone. Listening to this just makes me wish Metallica still took the amount of time to craft their songs that they did in their first four albums."
1,Can I give this 0 stars?,gimme a break... i love metallica to the death every one of their cd's even load and reload were better than most crap that comes out nowadays but st.anger is a joke..where did kirk's amazing solos go? james's brilliant voice? and the drums? ARE YOU KIDDING ME! im sorry to say this is over for metallica.
2,Where is Master of Puppets?,"A banal album, it will be sold only because it is made by metallica! maybe you'd like it if you like monotonous new metal...Thrash rulez!"
2,The worst Metallica album ever made!,"Some of you might say yes here again an old metallica fun who says that metallica don't make metal anymore after the black album but the real thing is that if you buy this album without knowing that they are metallica you will probably don't waste your time to listen to it. James' voice no more rings in your head,Kirk, he nearly don't play any solos in this album. There are some riffs that are not bad but the thing is that they are victims of this new generation metal and rock and this album [is bad]!"
1,ENTER TRASHCAN,Sharpen the edges of this disk as sharp as you can get it with out breaking the CD. Do it to about twenty used copies (you can find them in your local music store for about two bucks ea). Buy a ticket for a Metallica show. Get up real close to the front. As close as you can. THEN TRY TO KILL AS MANY BAND MEMBERS AS YOU CAN BY THROWING THE DISKS AT THEM !!!
1,...... my God!,"this is the worst metal album of all times! it sounds like a car crash, all tracks are long, annoying and james' voice is a sort of vomit-like scream. the dvd is even worst ....now, as i listen to Master of puppets, i start crying bitter tears. Avoid this s..t!"
4,alright,"o.k. I know that there have been alot of bad reviews but there r a few good qualities. The bad things r there r no solos and the lyrics r very repedative... The good things r, the loss of Jason Newsted brang a new theme to this album and the lyrics r good(even if they r repeditive). There has been many changes in the style of their music and this is oneof them, granted it is another ""stripped down"" version but the new bassist might bring new flare to the music but thats only my hopes. So, the music isn't all that bad but the changes arn't all good."
2,"Below average, something went terrible wrong...","After reading all the 1 star reviews and 5 stars, i decided that i dissagreed with all of them :P Anyways. I agree with most points that MetallicA's previous albums before the days of Load and Re-Load are awesome pieces in music history. Something went wrong with St. Anger when they decided to go back to their roots. The only two songs worth mentioning in this album is FRANTIC and ST. ANGER. Myself (and various others) just couldnt stand listening to the other tracks. The clang-clang-clang drums thing really went on my last and only nerves. The clangs was cool in ST. ANGER but when they repeat the whole thing in the later songs, it just gets to much. The bonus DVD and the access to the Metallica Vault website didnt do much either.This CD is just for VERY addictive MetallicA fans (even they may find the album dissapointing). This is just below the average, something went terrible wrong..."
1,One word says it all...,"Horrible!Save your money.. Buy yourself another copy of ""Ride The Lightning"" or ""Masters Of Puppets"".. Walk by this release with your back turned to it and your middle finger aimed at it.."
4,IT DIDN'T HIT ME 'TIL THE 3RD LISTEN.,"When I first listened to this CD, particulary the title track, I can say I was a little disappointed. It's also been a long time since I listened to Ride the Lightening or Master of Puppets, and on the 3rd try I heard the connection. This is raw, heavy, tempo-changing metal. If folks are worried about the emptiness / economy of the lyrics, well there are better sources for literary meaning and expression. Anger's probably not liked by people who ""met"" Metallica via Load and Re-Load. Give it a couple of tries - LOUD!!!!"
3,The fall of metallica isnt as bad as projected,"First off to many hardcore metallica head this album [is bad].And to a degree it does.When i first bought this album i was [upset] at how downhill my favorite thrashing band has rolled.ive listened to is a couple times afterwards now and its not that bad.its still bad.but not as bad as previously thought. the new metallica can no where to compare to such killer metallica albums like kill em all and master of puppets but it holds its own originality.metallica has evloved out of speed guitar solos and now right incredible lyrics. The lyric content of title song ""saint anger"" is amazing.""I'm madly in anger with you"" is pure genious.If anything bum the cd of an economically declined metallica fan and listen to tracks one through four.it no where compares to old metallica but the lyrics are amazing.i give three stars out of sympathy and its lyrics"
1,Metallica-SOBER??????,"simple and to the point-this new love of the life the band has found, has realy affected the overall quality of this album"
1,st trash,it sounds like in lars' kitchen !!!kirk is too handicapped to do a single f**king solo !!james is not an opera singerwho did the bass? wow only good thing (1 star)this sucks
1,just wanna say this still sucks,"I wrote a review before saying how much this album reeks of horse manuer.ANYBODY WHO GIVES THIS PIECE OF JUNK ANYTHING MORE THAN 1 STAR SHOULD BE LOCKED AWAY IN A MENTAL HOSPITAL.I don't even suggest buying or listening to metallicas' older stuff,this is coming from someone who use to love this band.Instead check out some real heavy metal from MANOWAR,BLACK SABBATH,& IRON MAIDEN."
3,a bit of a let down,"I was really looking forward to metallica coming back from the alternative phase, but unfortunantly was let down when i got st. anger. The main problem is one thing, BOB ROCK he co wrote most all the songs and even played bass on the CD this was a very bad move in my opinion, there are a few brutal riffs and very fast drums from lars but it's put togeather sloppy in parts and james' vocals are horrible at times. If they put a little more time into this CD it would have been alot better but at least its a big step in the right direction, no slow [stuff], no country and just about every song has a very fast tempo. Forsure its no justice but still alot better then []load and reload are."
4,Not bad,"I like Metalicca, everyone who doesn't like it seems to have some of thier life invested in the band, wierd but whatever works for you.I liked the songs, most were very repediative but that didn't bother me much. I liked the sound, I've always like the sound of metalicca and if you like there old stuff you'll most likely, like this CD. Most reviewers say the like to old but hate the new but it mostly sounds the same, so I can't see how they like one or the other."
4,St anger ...... round all your american necks,"Right, for a start i am a metallica fan and you americans, eating your mc donalds, can stop laying into metallica. yes thier music may not be up to their old standard, this is because they are getting old, come on Lars is 40 and he's been drumming for the majority of that time. now lets stop criticising them about their new stuff, and lets start supporting them and remembering their older music and also hope that they do produce more songs like their old stuff.so back to the point.some people may think st anger is rubbish and not worth buying, but i don't i found most songs on the album really good........ so here's the ratingsFrantic 9/10St Anger 10/10Some Kind of monster 8/10Dirty window 9/10invisible kid 7/10my world 7/10Shoot me again 8/10sweet amber 7/10the unnamed feeling 7/10purify 7/10all within my hands 7/10total 86/110so i hope thats put you yankees in line, we know who you are billy bob from texas........"
1,Disappointing,I found this album a major disappointment. The production quality is poor and I found the songs boring (who'd have thought?). I think this album is going to be retired to my CD rack never to return to my player. I've got plenty of older Metallica albums I'd rather listen to instead.
1,"Metallica's best album since Garage, Inc.","A band that has completely lost compass (the profit remaining its only compass) puts out again an album that copies the current trend - and does it poorly. This should not be surprising from the guys who started as copies (of Diamond Head and Mercyful Fate). Unfortunately, today, as forty year olds, they are copying nu metal kids who can't play guitar. People keep arguing if ""St. Anger"" is really a return to ""Kill em All"" or not. Of course it is not. How can they return to ""Kill em All"" if the only gifted member they had in writing that album has been out of the band for 20 years?"
2,Who knew drums could go out of tune?,"Who knew drums could go out of tune? I think that sums up the CD for me. The drums sound awful. Otherwise, the songs sound ok, the riffs are great, until the vocals start. The songs keep getting interupted by the drum's off-key ""ting"" and the inane lyrics. I mean come on, Hetfield, we're not expecting Shakespeare, but, ""..."" or, ""I'm madly in anger with you...""?Bah."
2,The 'Tallica boys dupe their fans yet again!!!,"I bought this album expecting a return to the metal that inspired me to pick up a guitar. I was looking foward to the beautifully crafted songs and musicianship combined with metal brutallity that made Ride and Master 2 of the 10 greatest albums of all time. OH YEAH, AND I WAS LOOKING FOWARD TO MAYBE A GUITAR SOLO HERE OR THERE.Metallicoin obviously spent the bare minimal money on production here. IT SOUNDS LIKE A DEMO. James' voice and Lars' snare obviously haven't gone through production. Kirk obviously didn't even show up. I could make this album in my basement.MAKING A SONG 8 MINUTES DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING IF IT HAS NO SONG STRUCTURE. I DON'T CARE IF ST. ANGER ROUND YOUR NECK NEVER GETS RESPECT IF I HERE IT 8 MINUTES IN A ROW.And I repeat, there IS NOT ONE GUITAR SOLO ON THE ALBUM.In conclusion, DOWNLOAD this album just to prove to yourself that the boys aren't fighting fire with fire anymore."
1,Metallica disappoints yet again!,"I don't know about you, but this is a note to Lars. I know that you are the epitome of the resistance against the sharing of mp3s, but that very act saved me the money I would have spent on this piece of crap. I think everyone who gave this a true review agreed with me on the fact that James' voice sucks, the drums may be fast at times, but that [*] snare annoys the hell out of me. At least one guitar solo would have been nice. I could write better lyrics to match this music in my sleep. I'm very disappointed with Metallica and wish they could actually spend the time, energy, and money to created some real music, with some meaningful lyrics, and tight, professional production. This is a slap in the face to their fans, who have been with them for years, hoping and waiting for something decent to come out of the Metallica camp (since the Justice album). Don't waste your money, just download it, listen, and delete. It's that bad."
5,The Return of Metallica,"Ok purists, let's get one thing straight: this album sounds completely different than Metallica ever has. Sound like Load and Reload? Not in the least bit...this album is actually good. For those who are bitter and are still expecting Metallica to return to their roots, I hate to break it to you, but it simply is not going to happen, so get over it. While this album may not offer the intricacy or genious of Master of Puppets, it does offer the best collection of original Metallica songs since Black Album, so be happy with that. It's heavy, pounding,a nd filled with Lars' best drumming to date. So open your minds and welcome back the kings of metal...this is a comeback truly worthy of the kings."
2,worst metallica album ever,wow if you're a metallica fan someone buy hetfield or whichever one of them drinks a bottle of JD and go back to make some older records. this makes reload and load look like masterpieces. those six people who recommended britney spears album before this have a point. rue the day metallica wants to become slipknot. i only have it 2 stars because it carries the metallica name.
2,Time for Metallica to retire.,"I would like to say that I used to be a huge Metallica fan. Kea, Rtl, MoP, AJfA were amazing albums. Even the black album had it's moments. I was hoping that this record would return the band to it former glory (for me anyway). I was wrong. The album sounds like a demo and the engineering is horrible. Also, I dont know what Lars was trying to do with his drumming. There is an effect on the snare drum that is not only annoying, but down right distracting. They lyrics and choruses are also sub par. However, the guitars on this album are great. Very kill em all , old school metal sounding. Buttom line is that it is time for Metallica to retire."
5,If you love hard rock...,"This cd rules!!! Metallica does not disappoint. Now, if you are looking for the Metallica of old with the mighty epic songs like Dispossible Heroes, Damage Inc., Creeping Death... you won't find that here. If you are looking for the Metallica of the '90's, well, this isn't them either. This cd once again defines what hard rock is. There are no ballads or 'radio friendly' songs, just raw hard jams. This is the best cd I've bought in years! This cd just f*$#@&> rocks!If you are afraid of extremely heavy hard jamming rock, this isn't for you. Don't take this one over to you Grandmother's house.The DVD is the coolest thing any rock band has ever done. It is the cd, but they are playing live in the studio. Seriously, they may have just set the standard, AGAIN. You just need to see the DVD to see how cool it is.BUY THIS CD! It is the best hard rock I've heard in a decade!"
3,Good value package with live DVD but not for the music,"The value package with live DVD and music CD in one low price, but the music is not the Metallica standard. Maybe Metallica wants to make the St. Anger CD rugged and coarse as a typical metal sound, but the whole music shows the anger without the angry purpose. Where are the beautiful guitar solo? What happened to the sound of snare drum? What happened to the lyrics?"
3,So close but yet so far,"On this album metallica came so close to their Kill'em All Days. I don't think we've heard Lars play this good(or fast) since Justice. The guitars(rythm) are done well. This album is a vast improvement from Load and Reload.Now here's the bad. James' singing is down right bad. Where is Kirk? What did he forget how to solo? If there were at least solos, the album would be amazing. Instead we are left with an empty feeling that something is missing.Furthermore, Metallica was always pioneering metal, on this album they sound like a wanna be system, linkin, and RHCP.For purist Metallica Fans, Stay away. For people who remember how bad their last 4 albums have been and want a step in the right direction then check out the album."
2,i hate tiltes,"in the best 'Comic Book Guy' (Simpson's here) voice you can muster...'worst Metallica album ever.'they have had some decent albums in the past few years (well, not since the black album), but you still have to go back to '86 for anything worthy of the name. i have listened to this album 3 times and it gets worse every time i put the headphones on. the sound is great, as is normal with Bob, but there is really nothing else to say about this album that is positive. well, aside from the pushead art that is. if your roots of metallica are deep, then don't waste your money. sorry folks.peace,ts"
2,"Not completely horrible, but not good by any standards","OK, for those of you who always complain about Metallica selling out, chill out! I really don't care about them making music videos for MTV as long as the music is good. The only ok tracks, though, are Frantic, St. Anger, Some Kind of Monster, Dirty Windows, and Shoot Me Again.But still, if a good group sells out but still makes good music, cut them some slack. Making bad music and selling out aren't the same thing."
3,"Awesome songs, bad production","Metallica's St Anger has the best songs the group recorded since 1991 no questions asked. Tracks like the title cut, Frantic, Invisible Kid, Some Kind of Monster and All Within My Hands are killer. The reason I deduct two stars is one, Bob Rock's production is awful. Why make Lars Ulrich's drums sound like tin cans when they should have opted for the heavy, cannon sound like on KISS' Creatures of the Night album with Eric Carr's drums. The fool Bob Rock said kirk Hammett's guitar solos would have made the sound dated, WRONG! Solos would have made it timeless. Another star was deducted for the mastering. Vlado Meller should hang for his poor mastering job, he also mastered the Staind albums by the way which is why they all stink. Metallica should have gotten Bob Ludwig back whom mastered their two classics Ride the Lightning and And Justice For All. Either that or George Marino whom did their other discs. I hope Metallica releases a better album next time."
3,What am I in Jamaica?!?!?!,"First off, this album does have some good heavy guitar work, but that's about it. The snare is absolutely dreadful. In fact I can't even listen to the album anymore because of it. I also have to echo many of the other reviews and ask the question of where the F**k are the solos, after all they are the one thing that makes Kirk stand out. I don't mind James' vocals on this album. As far as people saying that they used RTL as a template, well if that's truly the case than they really missed the mark. I would truly love to see them go out and do another MOP style album, but I just don't think it's going to happen. Hey, at least it's not like load and reload. The 3 star rating is for all of the amazing work they have put out, ie. Puppets, Lighting, Kill, Justice......."
2,very dissapointing...,"although some of the songs like Frantic and Invisible Kid were good, i was extremely disappointed with Metallica. This is definatly one if not THE WORST Metallica album. For new Metallica fans, I suggest their old albums."
3,Not Bad....,"Other than the title track, I think just about every song on this album is fairly descent. Whether or not it is the ""metallica-sound"" is another story. I admit that compared to albums like Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets, this album falls short. I think the production quality is not that good either. St. Anger itself sounds as if it was produced by a teenage cover band in a garage. If these songs were taken more seriously, and with a little more effort, this album would definately be more widely accepted."
4,Heaviest Metallica in awhile,"I've never been the hugest Metallica fan. I think the new cd is ok and probably is there best since the black album. Although it is not a return to ""Master of puppets"" back when metallica was considered cool. IT is heavy, but with new modern edge. Like I said most ""real"" metal heads do not consider Metallica cool anymore. In fact these guys are so full of themselves now. Anyone see the MTV special? Zeppelin and the Stones they are not, and I think they must be reminded. In fact I'd take Maiden or priest over Metallica."
1,They're gone...,"Well,I must admit I don't buy a metallica album since ""load"" was out.The black album was not a bad one,yeah it was more commercial but it contained some good riffs and ideas.It's hard to believe this is the band that wrote Master of puppets.They have never been great musicians but they knew how to write a good song and they had great ideas.Now st.anger it's out...I was interested in this one because of the voices talking about a return to violent and agressive riffing.I've listened to it yesterday.(A friend of mine had the bad idea to get it...)I have no words to spend...The songs are awful and the production goes the same way.James sings in unbelievable way(in the negative sense)and there's a giant lack of ideas.8-9 minutes songs without sense..."
1,"Metallica, ST. Anger","Without a doubt, this cd makes a better frisbee, than a music cd!Extremely weak production, and ... poor songs.I have followed Metallica thru the years with a sort of expectant urgency that they may wear out their creativity, before I get too old to listen to them. They finally have. An overlong bunch of repetitive , poorly produced, and just plain lousy songs, have pushed me over the edge....!Released it early out of fear somebody may hear it, not pirate it."
1,Waste of Money,"If you are a fan of Metallica as the blistering metal kings, this album is none of that. It seems like they tried to make it harder and faster than some of their latest garbage, but Hetfield's lyrics don't seem to match the music, there are no fingers bleeding guitar solos by Hammet, no neck snapping rhythm guitar as in their first four or even five albums. It is almost like they were all playing in seperate rooms and then mixed together. The drums sound cool at first, but even that gets boring. Although I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt as I really like Metallica, this album is a waste of money, even with a free dvd. Who wants to watch a free dvd of lame songs? It's almost like Metallica died after the sellout album and now their uninspired clones are making the music."
4,Not Great But Decent,"St.Anger is By Far Metallica's most heavy album, but many people are turned off by the lack of guitar solos and groundshaking lyrics-both Metallica trademarks-Which I think is a shame. If You would just approach the cd with an open mind and not think of the other metallica albums, this cd will grow on you. I first time i heard this I thought it was crap, but now i enjoy listening to songs like Frantic, The Unnameed Feeling, and Some Kind of Monster."
2,An Honest Review,I have been a Metallica fan since their first album and I can honestly say this is the worst album they have ever released. A lot of Metallica fans are going to say this is brilliant but this is merely due to the fact that they can't accept Metallica bringing out such a poor quality recording. The drumming sounds like he is hitting a garbage can randomly. There is some catchy guitar riffs but not one solo. The lyrics are absolutely atrocious. There is no excuse for this uncomprehensible babbling. Overall I would not recommend this album for the above reasons. Buy any other Metallica album because everthing else has a high standard of music unlike St. Anger.
2,What happened?,"I just bought this album today being a big Metallica fan and I'm very disappointed. The upside about this album is they're trying to be much heavier and using alot of style instead of being complicated. But, everything else went to the toilet. The quality sounds like they hooked up a tape deck in the garage and just started jamming. All the music as a whole seems unequal and unbalanced. Also, James Hetfield lost his flare in lyric writing and just repeats himself like the Police used to. In my opinion, not even hard core Metallica fans would enjoy this."
1,After 6 years it still stinks.,"I borrowed this c.d. from a friend and went back and listened to it again after all these years. I tried to get into it and it still blows. If you think this is the best Metallica ever then good for you. I personally will stick to anything other than this pile of crap. And before you say that I'm one of those that wants the same c.d. every new release, that's bull. Load and Reload were different and I don't hate them. I'm all for change but this just sounds like Metallica trying to be another group. If they changed the weird drum sound and put in some guitar yes it would sound better. The vocals sound like James Hetfield but the music????? No way no how."
5,The Real Metallica,"Thought the guys were losing it with the [stuff] of the last few albums. Looks like they got back on track with St. Anger. At long last a pure metal album in the league with Master of Puppets and the best Metallica album ever...(not Black album, not even close) ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL! Way to go Metallica, you made me a fan all over again! The album kicks major arse and in the best way!"
4,Meets Expectations (without satisfying the fans),"This was another spectacular album by MetallicA. However, put that thought aside for now. MetallicA is held to the standard of making a certain type of music within a very specific genre. So, for MetallicA to put out an album that does not fit that specific description, then this is the result. What I mean is: this is not a lyrically satisfying, nonredundant, mainstream hard rock effort. This is though a very well erected lyrically challenged, ACDC-like, redundant, long-song filled, nonmainstream hard rock masterpiece. For that I commend them. the job is to not be like everybody else, but that has no bearing on weather to be yourselves or not...and let's just say they've made some changes.Rok on!!!"
4,What do you expect?,"You've got to respect the evolution of Metallica. Everyone expects Metallica to continue with the lightning fast power riffs of the 1980's rock, but its just not going to happen. Bands evolve, sounds change, it happens. No one likes this CD because they are expecting to here 1980's thrash metal, but if you can look beyond the expectation of the sound of old, this is a good album. Metallica still has something to offer to those hard core rock fans, and thats seasoned experience and talent. They still know what they are doing, and they are still one of the best bands to this day. The only real let down of the new sound of metallica is the change in James Hetfield's voice and lyric, its not longer the raspy, growling, yet lyrical voice we are used to hearing, but it is not bad by no means."
5,"Metallica's first quality ""in your face"" metal album.","After being a long time fan of Load and Reload, Metallica returned in 2003 to release this album. While its different from the southern bluesy previous 2 albums, its a very hard and heavy album.In the early 90s, Metallica got bored and tired of playing the same trash metal every other band was playing and decided to take a different approach. So called ""fans"" immediately yelled SELL OUT! If you are a true metallica fan, or a music fan in general than you would appreciate this albums. 5 Stars is still not enough.For those who whine this cd isnt as good as the first 4-5 albums, then simply don't listen to this and listen to those albums.For those of you who also want long endless guitar solos, look for musicians without an ounce of musical creativity such as Joe Satriani and Ywngie Malsteem."
5,Buy It NOW,"This new stuff I will agree is alittle ""weird"", but no group can be sucessful putting out the same stuff. The online music you can download from their web sight is worth the price alone, but also throw in new GOOD stuff (finally!!) and a bonus DVD for less than the average price of just a music CD alone is awesome.Plus, while you listen to this, you'll start having memories about people and places that Metallica had something to do with. Such as concerts or other times you have waited until mid night to grab the new copies. I have moved alot in my life so that was a nice added bonus that only these guys are able to do. BUY IT, for the price you can not get any better offer than this one!!! Oh ya, this is no LOAD or RELOAD, even though some of those songs were good. Just about as good as Master of Puppets, but better in some ways. I will say that I do not see how anyone could be dissappointed with this CD if you are a true Metallica fan."
2,The reason why Jason Newstead left.,"No Melody, No Riff, No guitar solo...Only power chord and 6 minutes in average repeating....not worth to buy"
3,Not what you think,"Alright, first of all I am a big fan of Metallica, I am no kid 35 years old. Have all the albums blah blah blah. The anticipation surrounding this album has been tremendous and I can say I am disappointed. This album is nothing like the others, and its not heavy as a lot of people have been saying. The one thing that I notice the most is the drum sound. It is very tinny and sounds like a childs drum. All the songs sound alike. There are some good riffs mixed in there and there are no guitar solos's. James' lyrics make no sense. It seems like they were trying way to hard to make this disc great after there two previous releases load and reload. If you liked those, which I didnt then you will probably like ST. Anger. If you are a fan of master of puppters and Justice for all you probably will not like St. Anger. Well that's one man's opinion, give it a listen, write your own review."
3,HORRIBLE SOUNDING RECORD!,"THEY'RE BACK DOING HEAVY MUSIC WHICH IS GOOD BUT IS A SHAME THAT THIS RECORD SOUND VERY MUDDY, KIND OF LIKE A BOOTLEG COPY. BOB ROCK DESERVES TO NEVER WORK AGAIN. THE DVD IS COOL AND SOUNDS BETTER BUT THE DISSAPOINTMENT IS BIG. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THEIR GREATEST IF IT SOUNDED CRISP AND CLEAR LIKE THE BLACK ALBUM."
3,Disappointed!!!?!?!,"Being one of the biggest METALLICA fans on earth, it was hard for me to admit that ST ANGER wasn't that great. The way the drums were recorded just ruin the songs, not to mention there are no guitar solos. I hope that this cd grows on me over time. I would suggest not to compare this cd to other metallica ones because you will be disappointed."
4,It's something different,"Although St. Anger is very different than any of their other cd's, it is one of the best. With songs like My World and Frantic, it is pure energy. If you are a true Metallica fan you won't complain about how the recording quality might not be perfect for you, because it is a good album. Even without solo's the songs are long and they are full of heavy riffs. Metallica tried something new and they have won me over with their new sound...because this is Metallica and they will live ON!"
4,Fresh and Raw!,"I really enjoyed this cd. It's much harder hitting than ""Load"", and packs quite a punch. The bonus DVD is also a great plus, which didn't add to the cost of the album (a great gift from a great band!). I unfornutately :( don't have a DVD player, so I haven't had a chance to watch the DVD but I can't wait. Also included in the cd is a code to access Metallica music on the web and a lyric book."
1,sadly disappointed,"May i first make it clear that i am a huge Metallica fan. but as a guitarist i cant even believe kirk even played on this album, for if he had, it would have had mabye a melody, an solo, or even a decent riff. is that too much to ask?? and sont get me started on the drums (which sound like my little brother banging on pots and pans) nned something other than snare. the bass is nonexistant most of the time, and with all due respect to james's sobriety, i cant listen to this song high or sober, so i dont know how he did it. all of this is just made worse by the fact that i know that Metallica can be great if they tried, and if i could give a negitve star, i would"
2,another miss... by perro.,"After Load and the horrible Reload, I wasn't expecting much really.But, I still wanted to hear ""the new Matallica"". Failed again.The album's got it's moments, very heavy stuff (if u like Nothing Else Matters stay away from this album!), with good riffs here and there but nothing more. The songs are too long, not one classic here (all forgetable stuff, really), not even ONE SOLO... Kirk Hammet anyone?what's with that drum sound?And I really can't stand James singing no more.I wanted to believe...."
2,Metal's Decadence,"I love Metallica and their powerful music but St. Anger stinks. The new sound coming out from Lar's ""green monster"" is terrible, and Jame's lyrics are inane. I couldn't perceive Hammet's overwhelming guitar solos, perhaps they are now gone after the waves he has been surfing, and you can really feel Jason Newstead's absence in the band. I don't understand what Bob Rock was up to when he encouraged the guys to change their music vibe but the results are absurd.Anyhow, I do recommend their old stuff for it will give you a clue of what Metallica's ""golden years"" were all about."
1,Metallica should stop praying to a Saint who doesn't exist,"and try someone like Saint Jude, the saint of IMPOSSIBLE causes. ;) Is the resurrection of Metallica impossible? Only God knows...Saint Anger sounds rather cool when it starts out, namely, the drums. But then it all falls apart, and quickly too...like as soon as Hetfield opens his mouth. I'd say for being as old as these men are, they sound as immature as ever.Metallica was never very lyrically creative; something was always missing. But Metallica was once filled with some pleasant sounding sound-like when I was 10 years old. Metallica should have officially died long ago without making a mockery of the band. Holden Caufield would despise the members' phony attempts to survive their images. Metallica no longer sounds nice nor angry (although they should be--with themselves), and they've never had much to say... Either do I at the moment."
2,Metalliview,"...I've only heardone song(St.Anger), but the song I heard was enough to make mewant to hurl. It sounds nothing like the Metallica I know. According to heresay, they were supposed to be getting back to their ""roots"" of old with this album. If anything, they've actually taken a step backwards instead of forward. I'd listen to Load or Reload anyday before I'd give this new ""music"" the time of day. The only reason I'll buy it is to see how the other songs sound(hopefully better that St. Anger). I guess the four horsemen have finally put their saddles up for good. Ah, well."
2,disappointment is the word...,"I have been a Metallica fan for 15 years, so I was extremely excited to purchase the new album. I put the CD in my car stereo and one by one flipped through the new tracks. I couldn't believe this was the band I had come to idolize for the last 15 years. The lyrics were extremely repetitive, the drums sound like Lars is beating on a couple of garbage cans, and I don't believe I heard one single solo from Kirk. I've listened to the album at least 5 times, hoping I could make myself like it. To be completely honest, there are some good riffs on a few of the songs that are kind of catchy, but overall, listening to St. Anger made me want to put in any other Metallica CD just to push the memory of this album out of my head."
1,Metallipoop!!!!,"Some kind of MONSTER, SOME KIND OF MONSTER....this monster lives!!!.......and onand on and on..........Boring from the whiners of rock!!"
1,Some Kind Of Monster,This has to be the worst CD Metallica has to offer. I've only been a listener of Metallica for a couple of years and I really like their old stuff. This CD is total garbage. A complete waste of time and money. Jason Newstead must be glad he's out of this band. Old is definitely better with this latest offering. St. Anger is alot of that and more. Can't recommend this one. Production is pretty poor for a producer like Bob Rock. Get back to the basics boys.
3,St. Mid Life Crisis,"I get it. Its ""Mid Life Metal Art""A stab at ""I can still be ground breaking and new""Just a note guys, once you sell out, you cant go back....The album does'nt suck. The album takes some getting used to.Some songs hit the mark like ""Shoot Me Twice"" which I beleive should be getting airplay instead of St. AnguishListening to the album from begining to end, it goes from ""WTF IS THIS $@%#"" to ""Ohhhhh I get it"" to ""Hey this kinda rocks""Buy it on sale....."
1,Couldn't get rid of this fast enough,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the heavy, bluesy feel of all Metallica albums from And Justice For All through Reload. This album breaks that trend completely. The lyrics are awful, the drum sound has too much ""POP"" to it. It's just totally lacking any rhythm. I listened to the album just waiting for a song I liked. It never happened."
1,METALLICA MTV ICONS!? NUFF' SAID.,"DIDN'T EVEN BUY THIS ALBUM AND I WON'T. METALLICA IS ONE OF THE MANY BANDS BEHIND THE FALL OF HEAVY METAL. AS SOON AS THEY PUT OUT THE COMMERCIAL BLACK ALBUM (WHICH STILL HAD SOME EDGE BUT COME ON!) THIS WAS THE CUE FOR OTHER TALENTLESS BANDS LIKE KORN, DEFTONES, STAIND AND THE FAN FAVORITE LIMP BIZKIT TO COME OUT. THESE GUYS HAD FOUR GREAT ALBUMS AND AFTER THAT THEY WERE NO MORE. THE ONLY SONG I HAVE HEARD OFF THIS ALBUM IS THE TITLE TRACK AND THAT IS ENOUGH FOR ME. WHAT, NO SOLOS. THIS JUST SHOWS THAT METALLICA CANNOT THINK FOR THEMSELVES AND HAVE FALLEN INTO THE NU METAL GENRE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT SELLS. SCREAMING DOES NOT MAKE A BAND METAL! GET A CLUE GUYS."
1,JUNK!!! I wish i could give this cd a -5 stars,"About a couple weeks ago i saw the Icon show Mtv did on Metallica and hated almost all the bands on the show. We all can agree that Snoop Dog should stick to rap the song he cover was horrible. With that said, i would suggest people buy a whole cd of Snoop Dog doing Metallica songs before they waste ther money on this one! I would also like to add im 34 and seen metallica for the first time in 84,when they were GREAT. I guess you should listen to the 21 year old fans who say this CD Bl*ws."
4,Hitting it hard,"Wow...if you like your music heavy, hard, passionate and full of introspection. Buy this. If you want Ride the Lightning, go buy Ride the Lightning. They put it on the line and in ways reinvented their sound...I hope they stay along this path. For a bunch of guys closing in on their fourties, playing music for over 20 years, they come out in full, brutal force. Its not a mind blowing album but its a damn good one, best since Justice in my opinion. People complain about lack of solos, that did not bother me, I mean, why would you want something predictable anyway? To some it up. Hard, heavy riffs, changes everywhere, Lars going insane, James singing his [rear-end] off, new bassist tearing that bass up and it all comes together to make an impressive, unpredictable, hard, fast and unique metal album."
2,Repeating lyrics...repeating lyrics...repeating lyrics.,"Man these songs get annoying after a while! Generally the songs on this album start out fairly well. Some hard, heavy, even fast intros - good stuff! But when James starts singing...ugh... Its like they write a line and think its so cool that they can just sing it over and over again and that makes a song. C'MON! I want to hit 'skip' about a minute thirty into every song on the album! I give it a big thumbs down!"
2,What Happened????,"This CD was claimed to be Metallica returning to the Ride The lightning days... its much far from it. This album is nothing but headpounding guitar riffs, no solos, and terrible lyrics. Songs like ""My World"", and ""Shoot Me Again"" are catchy after listening to them a few times but in all a terrible album. I recomend any other Metallica album than this one."
3,Plastillica,"I am not so happy with this album, its hard but it just isnt the same. i saw mettallic live at dfp giants stadium. They were amazing life but the new stuff just sounds rough. I cant really get into it. And the lyrics dont mean as much to me. I am giving it 3 stars because its mettallic, if it were anyone else i would not know how to rate it."
4,"Thank for not being Load, reload or the black album","If people were really thinking that this CD was going to be like Justice, master or even Ride they were sadly mistaken. I feel this album is the heaviest stuff they have put out since Justice. I hated the Black and load craps they were releasing. I think it is a start for them to get back to their roots and hopefully with the new cd and Rick Rubin producing the new cd, it will move them more up to the time when we all loved the old Metallica."
3,What to say about St. Anger,"A lot of people hate this album. Yes, I do agree it is there worst so far, but its not a bad album. When I first heard it I hated it, but after a while, It started to grow on me. But another album like this one will mean the end of there career. Which I hope not. The best songs on here are St. Anger, The Unnamed Feeling, Some Kind Of Monster, and Shoot Me Again. I do recommend to buy this album, but get there first 5 before you get this one"
1,Metallica is over (sigh),"This album is really crap!!! Is(...)!!! Is NEW METAL, guitars drop tuned, stupid riffs, horrible drum sounding like cans, uninspired lyrics, rapper vocals... they're selling out, where is the trash metal? whre is the guitar solo? Metallica died a long time ago... long live to Metallica. We're gonna miss you guys!"
1,A Little Upset,"Well I made sure I was the first one at the record store this morning to get the new Metallica record. I picked it up, smoked a joint, and proceded to listen to it in my car. What can I say? I'm VERY dissapointed with this album. Kirk Hammet does not do ANY guitar solo's, James rhythm playing sounds like bad System Of A Down, and Lar's drums sound like a poor indie rock band recording. Maybe this album will grow on me, but im gonna throw back in Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets for the time being."
1,What a noise....,"Mmmm... did we wait all those years for this ??? For previous albums Metallica was criticized fro being too poppy so they went to the other extreme: just create a lot of fast noise... Sometimes it appears to not even have melody... I had heard they would return to the style of ""Master of Puppets"" but that would be an insult to that brilliant album. The only unique and cool thing is the DVD that has the FULL album played and filmed live which no band has ever done before to my knowledge."
1,Maybe they should take a break...,"St. Anger is a valiant effort on Metallica's part, it really is. It tries so hard to be different, a fresh new Metallica. It is different, very much so, and it is a new Metallica, but I wouldn't call it fresh. They realized the power ballads and great solo's had gotten old, so they replaced them with weak vocals and a harsh sound that sounds more like something you might hear out of the political-type punk bands. I think the sound is the biggest change on this album, but the second biggest change is the lyrics. Hetfield used to write incredible lyrics that were both confusing and clear at the same time. Here the lyrics are very blunt and rather trite, most of them obviously stemming from his stint in rehab. Metallica fans, no matter how loyal will probably not like this album, and it surely won't appeal to new buyers either. Looks like Newsted picked the right time to leave."
1,What Happened To Metallica?,"St. Anger, is the first post Jason Newsted Album, For that reason I had a very hard time buying and listening to it. Jason was the energy that kept Metallica rocking, and even though they made some less than great albums while he was in the band they seemed to have more energy and raw power to them. When I finally bought the album I thought well I'll give it a shot and maybe all the reviews were right, but upon listening to this album I found that this was crap, not even good enough to be called bad Metallica. Do not buy this unless you want it for your collection, it sucks and sounds nothing like the Metallica we know and love."
1,Hypothesis regarding Metallica's Disgrace,"For the record, I am not new to the ""Metallica sold out"" bandwagon. I didn't care much for the Black album or anything that followed it, and this piece of garbage is the culmination of Metallica's downward slide. What happened, you may be asking yourself? Metallica once had melody, rythym, lyrics, and production values higher than that of your average janitor's weekly paycheck.I think ""Metallica"" the creative force, not ""Metallica"" the band, left the recording studio a long time ago. Their names were Cliff Burton and Dave Mustaine. Think about it. Mustaine wrote/contributed to nearly all of ""Kill 'Em All"" and also wrote practically all of ""Ride the Lightning"". Cliff was a bass virtuoso and knew how to rock. Once their influences were purged through death and schizm, Metallica never recovered.Check out Megadeth's latest album, ""The System Has Failed"" for proof that Mustaine never lost the rockin' spirit.R.I.P. Metallica"
1,Major letdown!,"I bought the new Metallica cd today and I have to say it is the biggest disappointment imaginable. I have been a fan of Metallica since Ride the Lightning and this is just not good. Problem #1: The production. The entire album sounds like it was recorded in a tin can. Metallica's signature sound (heavy guitars, driving bass and powerful drums) is gone. It has been replaced with this overpowered snare drum with all the song pretty much sounding the same. None of the songs are memorable, in fact, most of the CD sounds exactly the same. I've bought some great albums this year (Soilwork, Disturbed) and this just doesn't rank up there with them. I'll stick with ""And Justice For All"""
1,James needs a fifth of vodka or something,This is definatley the worst cd I have purchased in a very long time.James shouldn't have sobered up if this is the [stuff] we as fans are getting.Lars sounds like he is playing garbage can lids.Nothing goes together at all.Bob Rock is old and dosen't know what he is doing on this album.Kirk is nowhere to be found and all I can say for Rob is that I am so sorry you thought you would be helping to continue a legacy that is just ending.Save your money or if you want to buy a cd of metallica get master of puppets or anything before load.
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","This by far is thee worst CD ever made. Metallica should just stop recording music because they have obviously lost it. There is nothing catchy at all on this CD. What is up with Lars new drum sound? I am a drummer myself and used to respect him as a drummer, but this album, he lost my respect. Im sorry but you just dont turn your snare drum off for this type of music they are playing. I cannot believe I spent money on this CD. Metallica just needs to stop and throw in the towel. Save your money. If your looking for catchy riffs and lyrics, you wont find it here."
1,Save Your Money,"First off I would like to say that this album I did not buy and I am glad that I didn't.I have heard it enough to say what I want to warn people about. The Song structures are very weak. Lyrics are really lame, and the worst part is that there are no solos. When they made ""I Disappear"" I thought they were heading in a desent musical path. ... This album is so bad I would not even download it. to say that I actually enjoyed both versions Metallica has transformed into. This is definitly Metallica at their worst and I don't expect it to get any better. I am trying to save you from despair, but you probably will buy it anyways. Because, ""Hey! Its Metallica."""
2,"See! We're heavy again... No, Really!","Well, they finally gave the fans they hate an album just for them. While I might agree that the album is quite heavy, it lacks the heavy, bassy, well-mixed ""punch"" of all of their earlier works. Even Justice is mixed better than this. When I heard the mix for the first time, I thought my speakers were blown. It's just entirely too muddy. Also, no Hammet solos, no epic feel. This is Bob Rock? I think the inflated egos of the band (ahem, Ulrich) knocked him out and attempted their own mix in his name. Either that or he hates them now and did this mix for revenge. I always buy CD's because mp3's sometimes lack the quality of sound. Maybe Metallica was going for a 64 mp3 sound just to kick their fans in the teeth. May their teeth be the nails in your coffins, fellas. And James, please, please no more rap-core. It's just embarassing."
1,Death to Metallica,"Fed Up should leave Terrence Reardon's reviews alone and stop countering Terrence's reviews or I will find Fed Up and GOTCHA him out of here! Anyhow, St Anger sucks!"
5,Metallica is back with a vengence,"From the begining to the end Metallica comes out of their several year long hiatus to deliver what is surely one of, if not the hardest and heaviest releases of the summer their newest release St. Anger. If the title track doesnt grab you with its killer riffs than there is definately somthing that needs to be adressed THIS is the album that Metallica fans everywhere have been waiting for."
1,What happened?,"With great anticipation I rushed out to buy this CD only to find one of the biggest music purchase disappointments of all time. What happened? After listening twice to this disorganized collection of speed metal songs where each track sounds exactly like the last one, I gave it to a friend who I hope can find some redeeming qualities hidden on the disc."
1,Big Disappointment,"I've been a big Metallica fan for a good 10-12 years now. I've waited in great anticipation for this album for a long time, and now that I've listened to it 4 times, I have to say it's absolutely terrible!I tried to let it grow on me, but it's not gonna happen. No guitar solos, Lars (as others have indicated) using tin cans for drums, terrible lyrics, and not much in the way of bass. James is just yelling and screaming, and I'm not sure what he's trying to do. Who the heck wrote these songs? Even with Load/Reload, there were some good songs, the lyrics were still OK.I bought the album because I am big fan, but I don't think I'll be listening to it anymore. Don't waste you money on this album, you won't miss a thing.If you're still a fan of Metallica of old, just do what I'll be doing, and listen to Black, Ride The Lightning, and Master of Puppets."
1,...,This is by FAR the worst Metallica record to date. They have gone downhill ever since the black album. I am sorry to say that I don't think I've heard a worse rock/metal album in quite some time. Too bad coming from one of the best metal bands of all time (in its hayday).
1,the guys need more money now!,this album is weak .i mean the prodaction is well done it sounds good but the lyrics are boring like metalicas load.with so much good music in the world i would not bother !!
4,Best CD since the Black album,"Just like the title says, I think this is the best Metallica album since the Black album. The guys have finally returned to their hardcore metal/rock roots with this one. Lars Ulrich shows why he's my favorite rock drummer by making the drum track stand out on every song. So why only 4 stars? Because the lyrical content on some of the songs is lacking like track 7 ""Shoot Me Again"". It's a good thing the music is good on that track because the lyrics just repeat over and over.In true Metallica fashion the tempo changes you remember from older Metallica tunes is there. I love the punk-rock beats of St. Anger mixed with the slower tempo changes. Bottom line: if you're an old school Metallica fan who also enjoys todays alternative/hardcore rock/metal pick this one up."
1,"waste of money, time, and listener's eardrums","Pardon me Metallica fans, but this is complete crap. With their decision not to havy any solos, the songs go nowhere and they all seem the same. Lyrics are all right, but, you know, the usual death/suicide/devil heavy metal talk. The DVD goes to show they're not really that good (except maybe Kirk Hammet)with their instruments. The only use this CD has is to scare your overreligious gramma.PS: If you want some good ole heavy metal, get Led Zeppelin II or How The West Was Won"
1,Deleting the reviews won't save this junk!,"Can't believe Amazon deleted all bad reviews this album has got! It is a criminal. But tell you what - no matter what you do, it won't save this garbage of album! ZERO stars!"
1,"Crap, complete crap","Metallica sucks now. No one can deny that. It started going down hill after ""The Black Album"". I hpe this is their last atempt at music. Just fade into abscurity like a good old band please."
2,Terrible.....just terrible,"What happened to the old Metallica? Lyrics with meaning, finely-tuned instruments and awesome guitar solos? I don't think they've sold out. They just suck now. Drums? Terrible. Lyrics? God-awful, just look at the song titles, like ""Invisible Kid"".""St. Anger"" is the only reason this album gets 2 stars. Because the beat's decent (the lyrics suck though). It's hard to enjoy a generic, bland album made by such a god-like band you know is capable of much more.So whatever you do: do NOT buy this album."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Good Either","If you're an ""ol' skool"" Metallica fan like myself you may find yourself quite disappointed in this album. Don't get me wrong, it has it's moments, but it's no speed metal. I can't put my finger on it, but it's as if Metallica lost their identity and ended up sounding like every other wishy-washy, trendy, commercialized ""rock"" band out there.I don't know about anyone else, but I remember when Metallica was metal - hands down. Hey, I'm all for broadening your horizons, but no guitar solos!!!!Bottom line - better than that junk found in their Load/ReLoad albums, but not even close to the early days. If you're a big fan like myself, you probably will pick it up anyhow no matter what people say. Heck, it might grow on you."
2,they changed for the worse,I thought the drums sounded really good. Odd sounding snare on some of the tracks..like he turned off the snares on the snare drum? They have jumped on the bandwagon with the low tuned guitars. It makes Hetfield's vocals sound different. How come no lead guitar? and no song with an acoustic intro building into a classic Metallica tune? they're trying to fit in with the current metal bands and in the process have abandoned what made them great! still worth having cuz it is Metallica.
2,I just don't know you anymore.,"As a disclaimer I want to say that I love Metallica!!!I remember how excited I was when Master of Puppets was first released. I remember moshing it up at the Justice for All concert in Lakeland, Florida back in the late 80's. The Black album and Load CD's were different but they still rocked.But something has happened. Something has changed. I just don't know you anymore. For a younger generation that doesn't have a memory of the old school days this CD might sound okay. But to the ears that helped put you on the map, what can I say??? Please tell me you're joking. Yeah that's it, this is just a cruel, sadistic, twisted joke and the real CD is coming out next month. I know that you didn't make me wait half a decade for this skimmed milk.If for some reason this isn't a joke. Save you money and burn a copy from your misfortunate friends that did buy the CD."
1,What Happend????,"After waiting forever for this cd, I can safely say that Metallica went the wrong way. But, if you like garage practice music, this cd is for you. If you what to hear hard core Metallica, don't bother with this one. What a heartbreaker!!!"
2,Nu-Metallica- just like all the other nu-metal,"I anxiously awaited for this album, but must say I'm disappointed in the performance overall. Metallica started as a pioneer of heavy/thrash music, but this is lame. There is not ONE SINGLE LEAD GUITAR solo on the entire CD, all 75 minutes!!! The songs go on way too long and many could use some serious editing. They now sound as if they have just been listening to the new metal bands and trying to copy them, rather than write interesting unique songs like they used to, circa ""Master of Puppets"" or ""And Justice for All."" Furthermore, the production is terrible in spots. Lars' drums sound tinny and the volume drops in many places. The recording sounds hissy. I'm sure the nu metal kids will love it, but it really is boring and has a ""I've heard that riff a million times before"" feeling throughout the CD. I'd have to hear their next CD first before buying anything else from the band again. What a shame!"
1,Why does this surprise people?,Metallica has not been the same since Master of Puppets. They sold out and there is no turning back. I stopped listening to them when I saw them on the Justice tour and they sounded terrible live. It seems things have only gotten worse.
4,St. Anger is energetic and heavy!,"St. Anger is the fastest, and heaviest thing Metallica has recorded in years. Instead of a detailed review, let me just list some pros and cons and let you decide for yourself.Pros:Heavy, Fast, Mega-riffs, long songs that start and stop and veer off in another direction at any moment. Raw and full of energy. The raw energy definitely is captured on the bonus DVD that comes w/ the album. That was a nice extra.Cons:At least one or two guitar solos would have been nice, the raw sound at times is distracting, particularly the drums which at times sound like Lars is pounding on the side of a gutter downspout. This could have been the heaviest album by Metallica to date with better production."
4,"Good, But not the best Metallica","This Album is great if you enjoy the earlier raw days of Metallica, but there is one distinct difference this album is nearly devoid of solos. I think Kirk Hammett is a great guitarist and was very disappointed to not hear him tear up the frets like in earlier works. But the speed is unmatched by any other Metallica album and is still a definite buy."
2,What the ...,"I used to be a Metallica fan from the days of old. This album is definately better than the last 3 [CDs] that they've put out. The problem is, it's almost like they're trying WAY too hard to get back the edge they've once had. Needless to say, I'm once again disappointed in them, especially after hearing word that they were returning to their ""roots""... Not even..."
5,Metalicca's finest album to date - should be 10 Stars,"I am fed up of reading the negative feedback this gem is getting. This album rocks from start to finish! If you like the old albums then listen to em, (they are all crap anyway). If you want to get into the future of heavy rock then get St. Anger. Metalicca have really taken off the ground now. The songs are good, the lyrics are clever and the pace is fast and heavy. This is a 10 star album without a doubt. Way better than their crap 'Black' album and even crappier 'Load' albums. All I can recommend is go out and buy it!!!"
4,Anger Management,Happy with album ... some great songs. DVD is a nice follow on from the Metallica DVD that inspired me to get this.One annoying thing is that the music CD does not load up easily on my computer ... goes through a menu ... still haven't really figured out all the options ... I certainly hope I can download this onto my mp3 player
4,Different but equal,"I have read many reviews of this album, but I havent found any that was saying what I am thinking so I have to write very own. I think this is a great cd, it is different than other Metallica cds but i believe it is worthy of the others. So mnay people complain about the production, but personally I like it, it has a ""live"" feel to it. This album sounds the like a live album that a studio cd can be. I think people need to lighten up about Metallica and their changing styles. If you wanna hear music more like Puppets or Lightning then listen to Puppets or Lightning. Metallica has matured why cant the fans? Oh, by the way for those who want to criticize me I became a fan when Justice came out. So, I'm not the true ""old school"" like others claim to be. And really am not worried about being a fan since the dawn of time. Thanks for reading my ramblings.Honesty is my only excuse."
1,Anger Management,"Naw. I don't like it. The DVD was a neat idea, and I appreciate it... but the songs are horrid! GHASTLY! NO! I DIDN'T LIKE IT! I HATED IT! THE PRODUCTION WAS CHEAP! THE GUITARS ARE LACKLUSTER! THE VOCALS ARE LAUGHABLE! I DON'T LIKE THIS CD!"
1,Metallica should call it quits after this,"Everyone that thinks this album is metal because it's agressive is wrong, metal is thought through, requires musical expertise and talent. To make an album like St. Anger you don't need any of these qualities. The production is horrid( the loudness of the drums makes it almost impossible to hear any other instrument), riffs in the songs are just thrown together without any logic, the lyrics are shallow and small minded, there are no solos, most of the songs make me feel less intelligent after listening to them, every song has a bit it could do without... I could go on forever. This is a dull album, and has nothing to do with thrash metal."
1,Worst Metallica Album Ever,"If it were not for the bonus DVD and cool packaging I would have thrown this piece of junk out of my window! Sloppy drums, weak vocals, poor production...and NO guitar solos? What the F*ck?! Are the guys brains that fried? Left me feeling used and cheated. Thanks Metallica!"
3,Is this System of a Down?,"This album is heavy, fast and raw.... but it lacks something.You can really tell that the Metallica boys have been listening to a lot of System of a Down lately... heavy influence here, not that there's anything wrong with that, but I agree with many other reviewers that the lack of solos kills this album. I was looking forward to a return of old school Metallica speed metal, but this is not it. I'm disappointed but it gets a little better the more I listen too it. C'mon guys, put out another Puppets, I'll be waiting..."
1,"Hello Kirk, are you there? New album title: Garbage, Inc.","I was waiting 12 years to buy this album since the Black album, and I was was so sick to my stomach to hear this garbage!I heard Metallica was going to go back to its roots, but the guitars sound mushy, there's no structure to any song, the drums sound like Lars is hitting trash can lids, and the ""singing"" is just horrible! Hetfield sounds angry just to be angry. His lyrics are terrible. If that wasn't enough, I thought maybe I would get rewarded by some of Kirk's solos, but he is nowhere to be found! I didn't know that there were only three members in this band!I have never listened to such a boring and monotonous album. Sure, it sounds heavy at times, but it doesn't make it good metal- it's just noise!If you are an early Metallica fan, BEWARE!!"
1,"""back to the bones of Metallica"" ...","This album, above anything, lacks EVERYTHING that made metallica my favorite band. tha majority of the songs on this album have no dynamics, melody, rythm, or deep meaning, much unlike ""Ride The Lightning"", ""master of puppets"" or any other album the band has ever released. This is like no other Metallica album, in a bad way. they say the album is very angry but does that mean it has to be out of control? The song Sanitarium is angry, but it has dynamics, melody, and everything previously mentioned. ""Creeping Death"" is angry but it still kicks. I dont know what they were thinking when they put this thing together. I hope they dont stay like this forever. I would like to see them put out some music with depth again. Heck, even some of their songs with no words at all such as ""Orion"" and ""Call of the Ktulu"" have seemed more deep and meaningful than the empty feelin stuff on this album. I wanna hear something from ""the heart""I wonder what Cliff would think."
1,St. Anger? Anger at paying $$..,"First off, Metallica is and has been my favorite band since my friend turned me on to them back in 1992. That said:If you like the sound of James and Lars playing on a 4-track in a garage with Lars playing the pots and pans, then this album is for you. Real Metallica fans will want to listen to Lighnting thru Justice. The songs on this CD are horrible. What made Metallica great were the lyrics and the awesome solos that Kirk would rip off in the middle of a song. Now they've dumbed it all down. The lyrics are of very poor quality. The guitar solo is non-existant on the album. This is the worst album they've ever done. For a 6 year wait from the last studio album (Reload) they've left me wanting. If you want to listen to Metallica, I recommend any of their other albums over this disaster."
1,Metalicca have lost it.,"I guess whatever Metalicca releases nowadays the ardent fans will still buy it. But this album is really taking advantage of the fans money. The music just doesn't hit the right points, dreary repetitive and boring to listen to. The riffs are easy to play, the drums sound like they are a collection of empty plant pots and paint tins, the base is literally hidden in the back ground. St Anger is one of the worse Metalicca tracks I have heard and altogether this is the worse album they have ever released to date. I can only conclude that Metalicca have now run out of ideas and have well and truely lost it."
1,gratuitous gamut of garbage,"This is the most dissapointing album I have ever heard. No guitar solos, fatuitous lyrics, and endless repition of said insipid lyrics accompanied with harmonies so rudimentary it could just as well be a cage full of chimps with drums and guitars. I would not recommend purchasing this trash to individuals I loathe. Buy Megadeth's Rude Awakening instead."
1,One big disaster reloaded,"I made sure I listened to it before I made a decision whether to buy it or not. I definitely didn't buy it. I can't support this, but I hope somebody digs this kind of stuff, because I hate to see what was once an incredibly strong heavy metal in my book fall to pieces. The songs seem poorly put together, James's voice sounds out of tune, and like he's trying to yell over the volume of the other instruments. The whole performance, or effort, feels forced, which could also be the reason why they sound like they are playing by themselves rather than together. Some interesting themes for their songs as usual, but alas, far from competently realized. I'm sorry to say."
2,Worthless,"Well, there isn't much more I can add to what has already been said. St. Anger sounds like it was recorded in a truck-stop restroom with a Fisher Price tape recorder. The songs are ridiculously repetitive and sound like they were written on the spot as they were being recorded, and James sounds like he's been eating razor blades and washing them down with battery acid. I'm not sure what happened here. It's like they didn't even try. Nothing new or even remotely creative here. Think System of a Down without the melodies. If this is the best album they can give us after 7 years, I hope they take 20 years to write their next one. Maybe when they're in their 60's (Geritollica?), they can give us one last decent record. ..."
4,REAL METAL HAS RETURNED,"I first got this not sure of how it was gonna sound.....i was blown away. This is one of the best CDs i have and one of the best CDs Metallica has put out. The bonus DVD is sweet cause it shows you how frustrating and fun reherasel can be (seeing as how i'm in about 3 bands...i would know). If you are looking for something loud, heavy this is it. It's mixed with the old school speeds, and new rifts. GET IT!!!"
2,at least it's metal...,"which is more than you could say for load(of crap)and re-load..james hetfield was going through a very hard time in his life,trying to kick a decades-long bout of alcoholism ,and suffering a nearly year-long nervous breakdown .as a result, his priority(understandably!!) was hardly making music and,boy,does it show... this album suuuccckkksss!! but,like i said, better than load and re-load..how sad is that??"
1,Pretty Bad.,"Unless you're a completionist that likes to have all the chronological work of a band (like me) don't buy this album. Pretend Reload was their last serious album, and buy Death Magnetic.You can tell when you listen to this album, that Metallica has talent. There's just something wrong with St. Anger. You can blame it on Bob Rock or the band, or you can grow up and not blame anyone at all, but the CD is certainly very bad.We won't really know if Metallica has run out of ideas or not until September, but I'm not so sure St. Anger is good evidence supporting one side or the other. This CD was a big experiment...it blew up in everybody's face, but it's obvious that everyobody involved in the St. Anger project was trying something *new*.I don't necessarily hate the album, but it's not something I can listen to. Maybe the next one will be more to my liking, but if not, oh well; everybody's tastes are different.Good luck to the band!You can't really condemn curiosity."
1,Terrible,Lars stands out to me as being the worst part of this disc. Seems like his playing/tone/mix pulls everything else down. I don't know how the other guys could have wrote anything better to go along with the fact that the root (drums) of the music sucks to begin with.
3,A different Metallica,"I'm a huge metallica fan, and i must say that saint anger isn't bad, it just seems different. at first i didn't like it but i do now. once you get used to it its very good. I prefer any of the first five albums over it though. no solos, growlier, like kill em all just a little harder and definitely weirder. its okay, but puppets or lightning or justice for all were way better"
1,it is as expected,"as expected, metallica go into i guess what they claim is a studio took yet another dump and out came this garbage known as st.anger.i'm not suprised at all, come on ""i'm really angry with you""? give me a break, a 10 year old could write better lyrics than that.but as expected somehow it'll sell millions. this album was said to have gone back to its roots.nothing whatsoever on this garbage. what happened to metallica? oh wait they don't even desevrve the name metallica anymore.until they release something good.which wiill never happen."
1,St. Geezer,"I'm no spring chicken myself, but aren't the guys in Metallica a little old and long in the tooth to still be trying for the ""angry young man"" scenario? It doesn't work for me..."
2,St. Anger,"The new Metallica album, St. Anger, is some what of a disappointment to Metallica fans. It is like Metallica is totally trying to change their style. Everything on the album has a totally new sound, I'll give them that, but they all sound the same, and there is definitely a lack of soloing which makes Metallica such a great band. I give this a 2."
2,not that great...you can have mine if you want,"i am not impressed at all. If your looking for good metal don't buy this album look instead to Anthrax's ""we've come for you all"" The raw recording is really bad. the drums sound terrible throughout the whole album the vocals are just not up to the standard we are used to.The sound on the DVD [stinks] so you don't want to watch the whole thing...at least I didn't pay full price or I would be very angry.Seriously, I loved all the old metallica and I even liked Load and Re-load I could listen to them over and over again, but this CD sounds bad and its all the same. I get sick of it quick. It is really muddy the guitars are missing. Metallica is known for their great solos ...well not any more....P>-b"
2,UNtitled,"I have always liked Metallica. Even there new STuff which isn't has good. To me all there Cds are worth buying. However NOT this one. This one was Awful!!! The songs are repatative and boring.One of the reasons i loved metallica so much is because and KIrk Hammetts amazing abilty to play incredible solos. BUt thes Cds has One fricken SOlo and its oNE NOTE long!!!!The Cd is much heavyer. There starting to sound like REALLY REALLY BAD NU-metal. Sometimes i wish i bought LImp bizkits Cd over this one. I would enjoy them more.MEtallica didnt sell out in this cd. selling out means you change your music so more people will buy Your Cd, but with this Cd no one is going to buy it...!!!"
1,major disappointment,"im a metallica fan.yes i do prefer their older stuff, but i like the black album a lot 2. there are a few songs on load and reload that i like as well. anyway, st anger sucks:1- the infamous production: ok ok i got it. they wanted 2 make it sound raw (couldnt they have recorded a live one???) i mean it sounds like they distorted the sound just 2 give it an ""edge""!!!!! the drums are the most annoying sound ever!!2- ok still. ill give'em a point for trying something new. get some better songs goddamn it!!!! the songs are lousy. its almost numetal!! yes it has glimpses of heaviness, but come on! there are tons of heavy bands! im not gonna bow down at every heavy part just coz its metallica, write some better songs!3- lyrics are awful 2. most of u have already heard st anger, its a pretty good example.""st anger round my neck, he never gets respect"" what the hell is thatttt."
1,The Fall of Metallica,"No more heavy metal, no more trash and speed metal. What is going on with them? The greatest disappointment after Reload album. Where is all the guitar solo and the speed? However, the drum is still there all time, maintain its heaviness.Jason is still better on bass, if cliff burton still around, he will be disappointed too."
1,I'm Almost Ashamed To Call Myself A Metallica Fan,"Just for the record, I am not just jumping on the ""Metallica Sucks"" bandwagon. This album is simply a disappointment.Don't get me wrong, I love everything Metallica did within their first four albums. There is literally not a song that I dislike on any of those albums. After that, however, good songs were few and far-between for poor Metallica. And this is the first album they have put out that simply does not have ONE good song.James does this stupid thing on Frantic where he goes, ""Tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock..."" WOW, HOW METAL IS THAT....And poor Kirk Hammet is probably crying under his pillow every night remembering the good days of shredding on Kill 'em All and Master of Puppets, wondering why the hell he hasn't quit and gone back to Exodus.Sorry guys, this CD isn't even worth pirating."
1,Sad but true,"It's over. The mighty Metallica have fallen. Never in my life have I heard a more disjointed album. It sounds as if they recorded short pieces and then strung them together in random order to make up 'songs'. The drums sound terrible, as does everything else. Save your hard-earned money for an album that deserves it, and this is not it."
1,simply terrible,"if you like this album, you're just lying to yourself. you're a sheep that will swallow just about anything this band releases. there is not one good thing about this album, it's an utter disgrace."
1,worst cd yet!!!,this has got to be the worst cd that they have ever put out.i wish that i wouldn't have bought this one.it has not one good song on it.james singing is very bad the music isn't very good.pass on this one!
1,Terrible,"Metallica has always been in my category for Metal, Kill Em' All is probably their best under that genre now. St. Anger shows that Metallica has totally lost their senses. They thought it'll be more fun to take out solos, to throw in repetitive riffs, simple drum beats, and some not-so-good also repetitive vocals. I really hope Metallica realizes what kind of album this is. Still I'm finding repeating in my head ""Why the hell is the band name still ""Metal""lica."" Sickness."
1,Very Poor Effort,There is absolutely nothing good about this album. This is not a template of Ride The Lightning. St. Anger should not even be mentioned in the same sentence as Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets.Everything in this album sucks. Terrible comeback album! If you want to listen to a good comeback album listen to System Has Failed from Megadeth and Brave New World from Iron Maiden.
1,this is terrible!,"Without a doubt, this is one of the worst CD's I've ever heard. I'm an avid Metallica fan and have liked everything they've released...up until now.The production sounds like something recorded in a garage, and Lars sounds like he's beating on garbage cans and cardboard boxes. Guitars are muddy at best, and James' vocals are absolutely horrid in comparison with just about everything I've ever heard.This is definitely not up to Metallica. ..."
3,Disappointing,"Metallica's St. Anger does not have that signature Metallica sound. James Hetfield seems to be struggling with his lyrics and sounds very angry. There are no signature Kirk Hammett guitar solos, and the riffs are much more distorted than ever before. It seemed to me as though many of the songs sound alike with many of the same riffs. If you are a true Metallica fan I doubt you will be satisfied with this cd."
1,And the Guitar solos???,"NO SOUND...NO GUITAR SOLOS...Is not a Metallica thats I know.BORED...THE SAME THING ALL THE ALBUM.I'M SORRY FOR YOU GUYS. Jason Newsted was a big mistake, please come back!"
2,Mushtallica,I was so excited to be getting this new album but once trying to listen to it for a couple of hours I gave up. It seems the boys who gave us some of the greatest metal/rock albums of our time have tried a different approach and in my opinion have failed.There are no classic Hetfield melody lines - No ripping Hammet sols what so ever and Lars seems to be trying to prove something by double timimg his drumming on every track. (and his snare drum actually starts to hurt your ears after a while)I can't actually remember what each track goes like as they all sound so much alike. Each one is down tuned and they sound very mushy.The best tracks have been put out first. Tracks like Frantic and St Anger. These are not to bad and have pushed my rating to 2 stars but only just.I ordered this album af line and was so excited and could not wait that I went to a shop and bought another one. That one is going back.Hope you like it more than I did.
4,justice meets the millenium,"It's heavy, everything you heard was true. No guitar solos, no catchy melodies, just the sledgehammer that was cocked and dropped on ""Justice"" brought down heavy again with a rawness and feel that has not been heard before. Not for everybody, the melodies are the staccato riffs and fast drumrolls that have been gone since the late eighties. The double bass and lonely growl are returned, not for those who jumped on the bandwagon. Angry, searching for identity and some kind of monster. Play it, feel it."
2,a letdown,"I wasn't expecting a stunning return to form, but I was really amazed at how boring this record is. The drums sound ridiculously bad, and you can really tell there was no bass player in the band during recording--And Justice For All is bottom-heavy in comparison! All the lyrics sound like Hetfield wrote them in rehab. What a waste. I think I'll put in the Black Album to remind me why I used to like this band, 'cause this CD is completely tedious."
1,Skip this crap go buy Iron Maiden's Powerslave album instead,I know i shouldnt be mentioning Iron Maiden here do to the fact that this album nor metallica has nothing to do with them but ive always knew that Maiden rapes the sh*** out of metallica and are the kings of metal and now I can say something that will prove it. MAIDEN ARE NOT SELL OUTS!!!!!!!!!!R.I.P Metallica
1,HOW? WHY? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"Listen, people, do yourselves a biga$$ favor and dont waste your freakin money. Metallica is absolutely not what they used to be. If you're looking for another Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightening in this cd case, dont even bother, you wont find it. Period. Not even a trace of it. First of all, the cover should set off warning lights (nuff said). Even before you pop it in, you should know to expect something terrible, because St. Anger got on friggin MTV!! If that's not enough, then what the hell are you doing listening to metal, go out and buy yourself some garth brooks or some crap. As for the rest of the album, cheesy lyrics, paling musicianship compared to past Metallica, and horrible song structure. STAY AWAY!"
3,"""METALLICA""",Alright people don't get yourself all mad because of one album. Metallica might not even make another album because of this complaining. I give it three stars because Metallica deserves the credit for being around for 20 years. I gotta say this music doesn't sound right if you listen to it right after some old Metallica. How does a cd get over 3000 reviews if it's bad. The first time I listened to this it wasn't that bad and it gets better every time. Even though there are no solos it's still good to me. You gotta deal with the changes that they make because they are aloud to make there own desicions.
1,I wish I could rate it NO stars . . .,"Let's be honest - this cd sucks. DON'T spend your hard earned money on this waste of time!!! If you really want to hear it - burn it off someone who still owns it. I lost the cd about a month ago and I was glad.It is actually funny - I saw Metallica in concert over the summer and they played two of the new songs. While playing them, people were booing them and throwing things at them. No one was happy until they played their old stuff. I think that about says it all . . ."
1,metallica is dead,"This album is very BAD!! Drums sound like a kiddie drum kit purchased at K-Mart. There are no memorable songs on this album, heck it even lacks guitar solos. Anyone looking for OLD style Metallica, And Justice For All and back should not waste their hard earned money on this piece of GARBAGE. Wake up Metallica and go back to the music you played with Cliff Burton, NOW that's what people expect!!! This album was not worth the six year wait, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT GUYS!!"
1,This album is bad,"I love Metallica but this album [is bad]! This is the end of the downfall for Metallica. They have been getting bad for years now they just downright suck. It's time for them to retire and enjoy their money, because they can't write music anymore. If you like Metallica don't buy this album. A bunch of teenage boys in a garage could record a better sounding album then this."
4,Big step up from the last sell out albums,"I have been a Metallica fan for a long time and this really is a good album the only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is I didnt like 3 of the songs but the rest were killer, so you have 8 tracks of kick [butt] material. So here is a full rating1 being the worst and 5 being the bestFrantic 3 - Its great live but on recording something didnt catchSt. Anger 4 - Good trackSome kind of monster 4 - Another good songDirty Window 5 - One of the best on the cdInvisible Kid 5 - Also one of my fav.My World 5 - Killer trackShoot me again 2 - Didnt care for this oneSweet Amber 5 - Great Song!!!!The Unamed feeling 1 - The third I didnt likePurify 5 - This one is a nice heavy oneAll within my hands 5 - Great endingI hope other fans dig it as much as I do-Jason"
5,Thank you Metallica,"This is heavy, Loud, and nasty and it kicks butt!... Can't wait ,to see them live!... Metallica rules this cd is classic!...Gets better with each listen and the dvd is a killer bonus!... I Love this cd and I highly recommend that you buy this one!..."
5,Awesome. A Great De-Stresser,"I had heard mixed things about this album since it came out. I'm not a die-hard Metallica fan, but I enjoy their stuff--especially Hammett's solo's and Hetfield's intros. When I first heard the album, I was confused. This wasn't the Metallica I was used to, and the album was devoid of solos. However, I kept listening found myself drawn to the style and the manner in which the album was made. The garage-band style gives them a raw, powerful, and somehow honest sound. The snare drum sounds like a low budget model from Sam Ash, but that's what I like about it. Again, it sounds honest and down-to-earth. The album is good for releasing anger, as this is some of the best aggro-metal I've heard in a long time. It lives up to its title. This is an album you'll either love or hate--there's no happy medium here. This is hardcore Metallica, and it's pretty awesome."
4,"don't expect another ""master of puppets""","Like another critic have written, ""this is the only album Metallica could've done this days"", or somethin'. Those who expected a ""back to the roots"" thing where disappointed by the album...why? perhaps they expected a ""kill 'em all"" type of album, with the guys all wearing their torn black jeans and sneakers, james screaming ""metal up your a**"" again... Thank God it's not like that anymore! It's heavy, but more than that, it's claustrophobic, paranoid, bitter and a astonishing statement of a guy (and a band) who's trying to overcome his dark side, his addictions, his weaknesses... i've been listening to this guys since '87 and i tell you: this is a strong comeback album! And for those who wanted a ""true metal"" album (whatever that s**t means), well guys i think you missed this band's point since their very beginning."
1,worse than Load/Re-Load albums,"point blank...they lied to us..the metallica boys themselves compared it to Kill'em All.....guess what?...NOT EVEN CLOSE.....this album makes Load sound like a masterpiece...they are trying too hard to sound like the ""Nu-Metal"" bands.....here's an idea guys....MAKE AN ALBUM THAT SOUNDS LIKE METALLICA!!....drop tunings do not make good songs...GOOD SONGS make good songs....this album sux,and I've lost all faith in them....and I've been a Metallica fan for 16 years.....it's a crying shame..."
1,Don't listen to American radio!!!,"This album won the Grammy award for best ""Metal Album."" If there ever was a statement as to how pathetic the American music industry is these days, that's it. Enough said."
1,Utter disappointment,"The best way I know how to describe this album is a Boeing 747 flying through a car wash. I have never been this disgusted/disappointed with any other album. Metallica would have been better off releasing an album filled with Village People covers. 4000 people have more than amply reviewed St. Anger, but I just wanted to let everyone know how bad I thought it sucked. I would recommend Metallica's ""Kill 'Em All,"" ""Ride The Lightning,"" and ""Master Of Puppets"" albums instead of this one. I will never buy another Metallica henceforth. Nuff said."
2,Thrash fan,"why why is this album nu-metal thrash, they'v forgot what thrash is just like sepultura they started to be crap in the early 90's = Why is some of the big thrash bands start to be more pop?? i was expecting more of this album..this is not for ju real metal fans!"
4,!At Last!...true Metallica sound,"hi there...i've read all the reviews and to my mind, there are only a couple of true met fans...those who have stuck with metallica since the beginning know this album is one of the best of them. Face facts people, they are not the same musicians from 15 years ago, they are a lot mature now and it shows here..a little of prog rock, old school heavy metal sound...just the perfect balance.Anyways, to those who jumped in the bandwagon since the ""black"" album, accept it, this cd is way much better, and the lack of solos prove that kirk and james are one, if not the best, duo guitar players in the field of heavy metal. Accept that the best parts of the songs were James amazing riffs...and here both of them play cool parts...just listen to sweet amber, St. anger, Frantic, The unnamed feeling...to thos e who don't want to accept it, go back to limp bizkit and korn...then come to the major leagues"
3,MY POINT OF VIEW,"In my point of view Metallica is divided into two groups: Pre Black Album (Thrash, Heavy Metal), and Post Black Album (Country, Hard Rock, Grunge, Punk/Metal). The Black Album Of Course being the ultimate combination of the both (""The Ultimate Compromise"").Now take a look at this album through those pair of eyes. IT STILL FREAKIN' SUCKS!But, the well known and potential singles are pretty fun and enjoyable. Metallica may not be able to put out a consistantly enjoyable album but they can still entertain metal fans in other ways. Heck my younger sister who is a tennis player likes to listen to Frantic.Buy it for the singles. Bring it home listen to it for a week, then burn it to your hard drive and through it out or give it away.OH and something else:If Metallica puts out another single it better be THE UNNAMED FEELING or then I might really be angry."
1,Boring,"Metallica's wort attempt. Since Metallica made this album I figured that American Heavy Metal started to go down. Except Megadeth and Iced Earth. This album is so boring. I heard it from a friend's house and I didn't take it anymore. Metallica really on this one unlike Master Of Puppets and ...And Justice for all. Metallica best albums from Kill 'em All till Black album. After that, the rest albums are s**t. It's really boring, don't buy it. Except, you are a Metallica freak."
1,mr slippy fist,See that album cover? That's what Lars is doing to his fans and anyone stupid enough to pay money for this S***.
1,0 stars!,"pthe best way to describe this .... complete hogwash, but why am i suprised, it's from one of the worst rock bands of all-time. this is a poor band at their worst!"
4,There is still hope...,There is still hope for Metallica. Here we go:1. They are back to semi-chugging riffs2. Metallica said themselves that they would have solos in the next album.3. Kirk Still has his hair and maybe the presence of his hair will somehow influnece James and Lars to grow out theirs. I miss Lars' mullet!
1,Metallica....,"The guitar playing of the songs isn't to bad...the drums sound HORRIBLE, and the lyrics are uninspired...you guys need to go back to drinking!"
3,Not METALLICA,"Alright album but it just wasn't metallica. Metallica is Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets. If you are comparing St. Anger with those two albums, St.Anger just doesn't cut it. I'm sorta glad i just downloaded St.Anger."
2,What happened???,"Metallica??? This is and was probably the most anticipated Metallica album of all time, but that doesn't always mean that the album produced will be up to standards as we have seen with other artist. The fact is this new style of Metallica has no melody unlike the previous albums, no famous Hammett solos, and no ballads. Yes, the songs are pretty hard but yet there are still harder bands out there. It seems almost as if many of the songs were written spontaneously during soundchecks. The title track St.Anger is probably the best song on the album."
2,Ouch,"I am truly saddened by this lack luster at best eddort for the Gods of Metal. I have waited for 5 years for this album, I had hoped the Metallica would come back and claim the throne that is rightly thiers. I am not sure what happened in the studio, But if this is the best that Bob Rock has to offer then he needs to retire. The music does not speek for itself on this album as it has on past ones. There are no (Metallica) solos more like Limp Bizkit, I am not sure what to think of the drums, sounds like my 4 yr old banging on the pans in the kitchen. I love Metallica and have listened to the entire St Anger album over and over again in hopes that it would grow on me, saddley it hasent. I cant speek for everyone, there are many who will love this album, I can say that it will sit at the back of my cd rack for eternity."
1,this cd sucks so bad.,"hey it's cozzy, (i swear this is the last review i'll make, or is it?) this cd sucks really bad"
2,The New Metallica,"Saint Anger just isn't Metallica anymore. Ever since Cliff Burton was killed in a bus crash, they were never the same without him. The songs don't sound like Metallica, in my opinion. If you'vebeen a fan of theirs since the beginning, don't buy this cd. Their first 4 albums, (Kill em all, Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets and And Justice for All) are the only albums any true Metallica fan cares about anyway."
1,St. Junk-o-la,"This is the biggest piece of junk I've ever heard. From the crappy snare drum recording, to the lack of guitar lead playing.Loose this cd/dvd and be a much happier person for it."
4,I would support Metallica even if they made an album of jazz,"Upon the first listen to St. Anger I was reminded of the ""Black Album"" and how different it was from everything that preceded it. At the time, my friends who liked Metallica were disappointed but grew to like it. Now we have a paradigm shift with St. Anger. The songs are raw and less pollished with a production to match. I'm not sure why there dosen't seem to be any solos. After all, Peter Gabriel made an album without cymbals! One thing is sure, James and Lars make the kind of music that they want to make."
5,Give it a chance....,"This album is just awesome!!!...Although it's true that it's absolutely different from any Metallica album of the past, I really dig it, specially tracks ""Frantic"", ""St. Anger"", ""Dirty Window"" and ""Some Kind of Monster""...Metallica has never been a band of trends, each and every one of their albums take a distinct approach to heavy metal, and this is no different....Who says that Metallica has to repeat past hits like ""One"" or ""Enter Sandman"" to continue to be the kings of heavy metal????....If you call yourself a Metallica fan, this album will grow on you, I guarantee it...Kudos to the Four Horsemen.....Can't wait to hear the new stuff live...."
1,And still they keep on going -,"Metallica continue in their tradition.Starting from Load, onto Reload and Garage Inc. Metallica has become a band of mediocre pop-trash-rock-punk. Hearing the past three albums, and now the fourth in a row, one has to feel that Metallica has moer or less used up all their potential.I believe in Metallica, it is one of the better bands to come around in the past two decades, but they have got to get a hold of themselves before they burry themselves deep under all this trashy music."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I used to be a huge Metallica fan and really anticipated the release of St. Anger. After listening to this album, the only thing that even reminded me that I was listening to a Metallica album was James' vocals. The production is sub-standard as are the lyrics. Kirk doesn't even play on the album, as there aren't even the first lead break or solo on the album. There are a couple of songs with good riffs such as Invisible Kid and Sweet Amber, but overall, this album sounds really rushed and poorly executed. If this was coming from some untried punk metal band, I would rate it higher, but coming from Metallica, I believe in growth in a band as much as the next man, but this is a step back not a step forward, for they are capible of much better. I will say this, the songs sound better on the DVD than on the actual studio album. I actually enjoyed watching the performances live, but they still could have done better."
1,Not Metallica,This album sounds just like Linkin Park and Limp Bizcuit. That's beacuse they were touring with them.
2,St. Anger Explosion of the fist,This album roars starting with frantic and song after song they just pound in your face. The metalic boys did wonders with this album and the new bassit Robert Trujillo wails like a ape on steroids. The dvd is amazing and it is loud. THis really makes the old metallica style come back with a vengance and makes its presence known. This will be another classic album for sure. To sum this one up the metallica boys make up for the load\reload era and step up to the plate and shovel song by furious song in yor face and leave you standing in the dust. All that I can say is HEAVY METAL HAS FINALLY COME OUT OF THE CLOSET ONCE MORE.
2,Wanted to like it but.......,"From being a great fan of Metallica from the get go, I think they are trying to hard to fit in to today's alt metal. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I think this could have been a great cd returning to their roots. I am very disappointed. Buy Garage Inc instead or Black and before. If you like Load and Reload then this will be your cup of tea....."
3,st. headache,"What can i say, this album is definetly aggresive. Long drawn out songs that pound you in the skull. No slow songs on this album.It wasnt what i was expecting from metallica. The sound is definetly different, maybe due to the new bassist they have now? The catchy Kirk solos and intros are gone, enter fast chunky heavy riffs, it also sounds like Lars must of gone threw a few drumkits making the album.One big pound fest, thats the only way i can describe it, it is starting to grow on me, but i think ill only be going back to this album when im in the mood to destroy something.I prefer any of there older work to this album."
4,STOP COMPLAINING,"I seriously dont think alot of you who wrote reviews are metallica fans, your just a bunch of people who got their napster account banned. If you were real fans you would relize what metallica are trying to do. there trying to change their style of music and go back the way they were. sure this album isnt as good as MASTER OF PUPPETS but that doesnt mean it sucks either.1.FRANTIC 9\102.ST. ANGER 8/103.SOME KIND OF MONSTER 10/104.DIRTY WINDOW 7/105.INVISIBLE KID 9/106.MY WORLD 6/107.SHOOT ME AGAIN 9/108.SWEET AMBER 7/109.THE UNNAMED FEELING 8/1010.PURIFY 6/1011.ALL WITHIN MY HANDS 9/10"
1,Extremely Dissapointed,"Once again Metallica had established themselves as a band that goes with the flow of the music industry. They changed to a commercial style and now??, I don't even have a clue. It is a mix of Godsmack and Papa Roach I don't know. Not that I don't like those bands, simply it doesn't fit, or goes along with their style.Then the audio quality, it seems that they put a microphone in front of them while they were jammin. I gave one star because it is the lowest choice, but im my opinion they deserve an ""F"" for this effort."
3,finished,the cd dvd pacage is great. the album it self isnt the best album but i finished my collection so its cool
3,Good Album,"I for one like this Album. The sound is raw and imperfect, it has a gritty feel and the songs are strong solid expressions of anger frustration and the desire to overcome these emotions. It is a Riff Happy monster, and no one involved with the making of this should be ashamed of what they produced. Good Record."
3,Great group--disappointing collection.,"This CD represents parts of two Japanese releases by the Plastics. It's interesting that all previous reviewers mention the B-52s, as the Plastics toured with them. In fact, they were the hit of the show when I saw them in 1980. Boundless energy and the surprise of hearing the group for the first time made it a night not to forget. Unfortunately, neither of the two CDs (Origato Plastico is the other) listed include ""Last Train to Clarksville"", the Monkees remake, which for me was a highlight of the Plastics first Japanese release. There are several other tracks from the first record that aren't on CD here. It's all good stuff. Just wish it had all the stuff."
4,quirky japanese punk pop,"Totally mental synth punk new wave pop japanese fusion kinda thing! You need a sense of humour to appreciate these tunes but there is also musical talent here. Check out the tongue in cheek ranting against consumer culture of ""cards"" or the mellow pop vibe of ""peace"". The female lead vocalist has a great voice and there are also tracks featuring a male lead. Give it a go!"
3,Not bad for the price.,"I found this in the $5 bin at Wal*Mart the other day. Included on the set are the first 10 episodes of the show's first season. They are listed on the back of the DVD as follows:1. Johnny to the Center of the Earth / Johnny X2. Johnny vs. Bling Bling Boy / Johnny Impossible3. Aqua Johnny / Johnny & the Amazing Turbo Action Backpack4. Johnny Test: Party Monster / Johnny Test: Extreme Crime Stopper5. Johnny & the Ice Pigs / Johnny's House of Horrors6. Johnny's Super Smarty Pants / Take Your Johnny to Work7. Johnny & the Mega Robotics / Johnny Gets Mooned8. Johnny's Turbo Time Rewinder / Johnny Hollywood9. Sonic Johnny / The Return of Johnny X10. The Dog Days of Johnny / Johnny's Pink PlagueOverall though, I'd rather spend the extra dollar and get the complete first and second seasons (16 more episodes) here at amazon (currently listed at $7.99)."
4,A Mile In His Shoes - feel good movie,"I really liked ""A Mile In His Shoes"". I have a nephew that has Downs Syndrome and we always seem to be limiting what he can do, but a movie like this reminds all of us that no matter what we have been dealt with in life, that we have a special talent and we just need someone to believe in us and give us a chance."
3,Fair to Middle Story,Ok movie... had great potential but limped home... left out keys pieces like why his Dad was always so angry... safe for family but no very inspiring.
4,A Mile in His Shoes,Good story and followed well throughout it. Some good new people I hav enot seen before in movies. Love those baseball stories.
5,A Mile In His Shoes,A Mile in His Shoes was a great family movie with a great story. I would recommend this movie for anyone.
2,A Mile in His Shoes,"This was an ok movie. Watching it with my son, he thought the baseball players didn't act very well.The theme of the movie was good but I wouldn't recommend buying this, just rent it."
3,Question for those who have this ...,"Does this soundtrack have the children singing ""1, 2 Freddy's coming for you""? Thanks."
5,Awesome scores,I think Nightmare On Elm Street has the best score of any horror flick. This cd takes the best scores from 6 of the Nightmare films and puts them all into one. My personal favorite tracks have to be the NOES 5 scores. A dark score for a dark movie.
1,VERY BAD PRODUCT.,I bought this about a month back for a trip to New York and Niagara. This is the worst product I have ever used. I'm a Sr. Software Engineer by profession and I don't understand how Microsoft can even release such a bad software in the market.Bottom line - you should never buy this software.
2,No point to upgrade,"I upgraded from 2003. So far I haven't seen any inprovements, no new roads, no new POI's only some old roads now in the wrong location, software locked up and had to be reinstalled, and now my GPS unit which worked with 2003 dosen't work"
4,Microsoft Streets and Trips 2006,I have used this product before and the upgrade to this version was easy. All the maps I had stored from an earlier version were upgraded with no problem.
4,Streets & trips,I needed to up grade. Good buy. need to up grade again one of these days. Got to buy a new version.
4,I bought this just for the GPS,"The USB GPS unit works great. It also works in Microsoft MapPoint (NA and European versions). The 2006 version of S&T now provides voice guidance which lets you set up your laptop in the front seat before your trip, pop the GPS in the front window and let it give you guidance hands free while driving."
3,Another Buggy Release!,"I was really expecting some improvement in the 2006 version. I think the 2004 version had the most items that worked.They FIXED the Post offices not appearing in ""Show Places"". Microsoft just ELIMINATED Post Offices as a search item.When I try to update construction information, I am told ""An internet connection is required to downlosad construction updates. Your computer is not configured properly to connect to the internet.""?? I have a permanent wireless connection via a cable modem (or whatever connection is offered at hotels I stop at) to the internet on my laptop.No solution has been offered. This was NOT an issue with 2005 and prior versions!!??I hate buggy software!They did fix some missing Interstate interchanges in Pennsylvania. (They used to have you travelling around on local streets until you came to an interchange they did show)."
1,Inexcusably Out-of-Date Maps and Attractions Database,"Do NOT make the mistake that I did and buy this software expecting it to contain updated and reasonably recent (say, 2-years-old) maps and ""attraction"" (hotels, restaurants, etc.) data. In every instance I have checked so far, the maps are substantially more obsolete than they were in Streets & Trips 2004. Example: the street on which I live, which was built around 1997, was on the S&T; 2004 maps, and an S&T; search for my address correctly located it in that version. Not any more. And the listings of restaurants and hotels/motels, which change rapidly, are now so obsolete as to be totally uesless.Shame on Microsoft for apparently working only on the bells and whistles of this software and not only neglecting what should be its prime functions (mapping and locating places) but actually degrading them compared to the 2004 version."
4,"Beware: Location of ""places"" not reliable...","On several occasions ""places"" identified on the map are erroneously located. Ergo, while I find ""Streets and Trips"" an invaluable travel tool, to save yourself some trouble you should be careful to verify just where some of those ""places"" really are."
3,MS TRIPS AND STREETS,THE MAP IS OUT OF DATE THREE YEAR OLD STREETS ARE NOT INCLUDED. IN PLANNING ROUTES HANGS UP AND HAVE TO START OVER.
2,Trip routing doen't work right,"One of the most basic features of this program is broken. Specifically it does not always find its own best route between two locations. For example, I can ask it to route me from my house in the suburbs of Boston to a location in the White Mountains in Maine. It gives me a route with a drive time of 4 hours 2 minutes. I can then add a stop that is off the route, ask it to route again incorporating this stop, and now the total drive time is 3 hours and 30 minutes. Since this route is faster, the program should have found it in the first place. A half hour savings on a 4 hour trip is a big error.Further casting doubt on the routing is the fact that when I add the stop the suggested route changes downstream from a point that is common to both routes. There is no reason for that, either.This is a very serious flaw since it undermines confidence that any route is the right one. Conclusion: this program's routing algorithm is broken."
4,MS Streets and Trips,"Fast. Accurate maps. Minor inacuracy in location of addresses.I use this instead of any online map for ALL map information.Once loaded, the mapping software runs without Data CD.Good Canadian maps.Annoying update bar on Directions panel doesn't go away after construction updates are performed.A good buy. Recommended."
2,Fine if useing on a computer,"Absolutely useless if you want to use it on your PDA/Cell phone.Doesn't have Voice ActivationCan Not do Driving DirectionsWith GPS, all you get is a map and here you are, but can't tell you how to get anywhere but where you are right now."
2,PPC GPS travelers stay away.,"Ok, I'm not an anti-Microsoft Nazi at all. I love most of their products. However, I ""upgraded"" to Pocket S&T 2006 from my Pharos Ostia software because PS&T has all the cool extra info in their maps such as ATMs, gas stations, etc. I was so disappointed to find that Microsoft still has not issued a fully functioning routing package. S&T 2006 is, like the previous versions just a cool way to see where you are. Getting to where you want to go using PS&T is freakin' impossible if your destination is more than a few turns away. When will they figure out, like all the other routing softwares for PPC users, that we need more than just a map, we need an application that will give us directions to our destinations. Ok, to be fair to those who travel with their laptops on the passenger seat, this program is great ... hence, 2 obligatory stars. I'm speaking for the PPC users. Until Microsoft gets PS&T to the level of the competition, try Ostia. It works great."
5,A Happy Customer,"This product was fairly priced, delivered quickly and exactly as advertised. And, it completed my Avengers collection."
3,Pass on these. Pick up the Bose Companion 2 if you care about quality in sound.,"Picked these up for the option to add different audio sources. The speakers look good with removable grills. The other reviewers are right when these speakers lack in range. Good for plain stereo applications if you have friends over. These are not good for personal listening or for watching movies. When these speakers are turned up, they sound labored. Somewhat like a bad American Idol audition when they think they can sing, but just sing really loud, and they think they sound good. There's a very poor sound stage that's evident when you try different audio sources on the speakers. If you want something better for personal listening, check out the Bose Companion Series 2 - I've been very happy with these speakers.Bose Companion 2 Series II multimedia speaker system"
5,Best 2.0 PC speaker,"This is the best 2.0 PC speakers of all for the price range, crystal clear stereo sound with very solid base. I custom build PC for friends and quite of few people and i only use these speaker and they all very happy with the sound quarlity, the only down side is they are being sold out everywhere very hard to get them now, i hope they are not being discontinued that, would be very sad!"
2,Great while it lasts,I received these speakers as a gift and they were fantastic... until about a year later the volume knob started to cause crackling and now the volume goes in and out. Really need some quality control from Klipsch on these.
2,"Good speakers, but not wireless as advertised","We recently purchased these speakers and returned them today. They sounded great with impressive volume and quality. However, the speakers were included in a search result on Amazon for ""wireless computer speakers"" and they are not wireless. The combination of the incorrect tag/label and picture with no wires connected, including the blue light (typical for a wireless accessory) displayed prominently, is very misleading.We've rated a 2 due to being very disappointed over receiving an item different than what was suggested in the advertising."
4,Very good computer speakers,"With these speakers, you're not going to get high-volume or house-shaking bass. If that's what you want, buy something else. These are $100 computer speakers, not a replacement for your home stereo.I chose these speakers over the Bose Companion 2 (exact same price, and arguably the same sound quality) for the following reasongs:1) The Bose model looks ""plasticy"", the Klipsch dooesn't (I have the black model, btw)2) The Bose model doesn't have an on/off switch, the Klipsch does3) The Bose model's line in is on the back, the Klipsch has it on the front (easier to get to)I rate sound quality as 8.5 out of 10 (vs. my home stereo at 10/10). Don't expect audiophile sound from these little speakers, and you'll be happy with them.My only complaint is the volume dial: the knob is solid black and you can't see how high you have the volume turned up. A little white on the knob would be a big help."
2,great sound but short life,The speakers have great sound but after 6 months the speakers would quit without warning. I checked Klipsch message board and this seemed to be a common problem.
1,Enjoy them while they work,"The Promedias sound great for about the first year. After that, the power switch/volume pot goes bad.I wrote to Klipsch and asked about this, and they referred me to some third party company they said would fix this (not free.) I am not sure how much they would charge for this, but this is unacceptable. I have a nice set of paperweights now.I will not be buying Klipsch again."
1,"Title should be ""A Little about ETF's""","This book is more about Archie Richards' personal investment philosophy than it is about ETF's. I'm not sure who his target audience is, but I can assure you if you want to learn about ETF's, you are going to be spending about 75% of your time reading about Archie's personal opinions about the investment world and what is wrong with it. The other 25% covers what ETF's are and how they work. It may be good info. if you want to be the Cliff Claven of ETF's at your friendly neighborhood bar. But if you want to learn how to use ETF's as a viable investment, you would be better off going to the websites of the sponsors for these funds and read their free information. I can think of only one market that can benefit from this book - those of you who have never invested in your life, are VERY conservative and are prepared to buy and hold your investments for more than 20 years. For the rest of you, don't waste your time or money."
5,Five stars from a tough critic!,"Firstly, the most important criteria of any soundtrack was satisfied: the music is in STEREO ! (unlike the DVD title which is sadly mono).Secondly, every theme or tune in this epic movie is covered in this compilation. Nothing irritates me more than a soundtrack release that leaves out important tracks or teases you with inadequately covered ones.Thirdly, nearly every track has a different theme or tune giving variety and a long shelf-life to this product. This just reflects the awesome creativity of Basil.(The only criticism I have is a small one. Did they really have to put that constant, irritating sound of grinding metal in the track titled ' Wheel of pain ?'"
3,...err,"...nobody has noticed that it's a complete rip off of Stravinky? Buy the whole movie, where the music truly deserves 5 stars. If schwarzenegger doesn't get in politics, this will become a classic of fantasy epics. But I've rarely heard a soundtrack that retells the plot of a movie as faithfully and literally as this one, and in an epic, that's a good thing. If you go for the music alone, get Stravinsky's firebird or something like that instead."
5,THE GREATEST OPUS ONE IN FILMSCORE HISTORY,"While I cannot quite put Conan the Barbarian in the league of Ben Hur, Empire, or Superman... it is close. But without any doubt, it the most impressive premiere soundtrack by any film composer. A very good case can be made for The Wrath of Kahn by Horner, but in the end, there is no comparison. Basil Poledouris' magnum opus is full of powerful themes- Mountain of Power Procession, Anvil of Crom- yet is not without moments of the most touching beauty. I have actually wept in listening to some of the tracks on this, such as Theology/Civilization and the Wifeing. It's unfortunate that this Varese version is out of print, it is by far superior. The Kitchen/Orgy is extended and the Mountain of Power Procession is an awesome track, not available on the Milan version.For all lovers of great music, this is indispensable."
4,One of Poledouris' best works,"Reading the other reviews, I notice one track that stands out: ""The Anvil of Crom""This is an obvious choice. The piece opens with 24 French Horns (four times the normal orchestral number) in a low register blasting out the theme, with barbaric drums pounding in support.The other truly terrific track is ""The Orgy"" with it's driving orchestral music, soaring chorus, and punctuating cymbals (and gongs).Terrific fantasy score, and great music to ""death-match"" by."
5,One of the all-time greats,"Ranks up there or even betters the all time greats like ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,"" ""Jaws"" and ""Star Wars.""For those who like this soundtrack & want to find something similar in classical music, find ""Scheherazade"" by Rimsky-Korsakov. It will take you on a musical adventure too, but this time an Arabian Nights type of adventure."
5,"One of the greatest movie scores ever... no, really!","So what if it's a sword-and-sorcery flick? There are few other scores that have been so perfectly composed around their subjects. This movie made such an impression on my then-15-year-old mind, and a large part of it was due to the music. Of course, now that another 15 years have passed, I can evaluate the score much more intelligently and objectively, and it's still great. There are some very good liner notes included in the booklet, comfirming my suspicions that the works of Orff and Mozart influenced Poledouris' works for this film. Even if you hate S&S movies, or classical music in general, give this CD a try. It's powerful stuff, packed with tunes that should interest even the casual listener."
4,Conan the Barbarian,"I absolutely loved the movie, and was intrigued by the background music. I have been looking for this soundtrack for the longest time and when I heard the first track, I knew I had made a great purchase. I absolutely love it!"
5,Powerful and Inspiring,"Poledouris' orchestral score is simply awe-inspiring. Has all the power of Holst's ""Mars"" (from ""The Planets"") yet eloquently weaves more sensitive melodies that make me think of Copland. If you seek music to move you, buy this CD. Forget about Schwarzenegger's movie. This music stands on its own!"
5,NOT SURE YET...BUYER BEWARE!,...I've recently found out that there are two different versions of this soundtrack out there! It seems that there is a shorter 12-track version out there. ...
5,greatest fantasy music ever,"This is a GREAT CD. The music conjures images of, well, Conan the Barbarian. It is strong and rich, and in it you can 'see' strange faraway places, savage warfare, and other niceties of human endeavour."
5,One of my all-time favourite soundtracks,"An awesome soundtrack, wonderfully convey's the world that Conan lives in. Very rich in sound and themes, although I love the entire CD my two favourite tracks would have to be track 6 and 12. One of Poledouris best efforts."
5,EXCELLENT music,"I recently got the CD, played it and listened. The music blew my head away so to speak. Especially the first and second tracks. It moved and shaked me. I felt I was a warrior fighting with Conan next to me. Wow. I rate this album wit six -******- stars. This CD reminds me of another great CD (Prince Valiant) which music brings you in the warrior spirit."
5,Great... But Still a Bit Mysterious,"I read this book thinking (and probably pretentiously so) that I myself was passing through a 'dark night' of sorts. This, however, is dangerous. Reader beware - this book is written by a saint who is also a Doctor of the Church. It tells of the ""aridity"" and consolations the soul experiences when approaching God. To be honest, I found it quite frighting. I recommend it, but I advise mature handling of St. John of the Cross' words."
4,thought provoking in the deepest sense possible,"this book will take you on an exploration deep into the source of yourself to the not so joyfull aspect of the soul that we know all too well. its effects bring us beyond words to an understnding and sincere fondness for the neccesity of knowing the other aspects of the soul, as we begin to embrace daily sadnesses and griefs as an enriching part of our life. if you are willing your soul will have the experience of a lifetime and your knowledge of self will climb to a new height. ."
2,difficult read,It was with great anticipation that I received this book. Very disappointed with the translation - long cumbersome sentenances with archaic and obsure words make it most difficult to read. I plowed through to the end. Content seemed to be repetitive. I should reread it but just can't bring myself to do it again.
1,"Don't confuse this with ""Dark Nights of the Soul"" by Thomas Moore","I have purchased Thomas Moore's book, ""Dark Nights of the Soul"" so many tmes for me and for my friends who are having life's troubles that seem too hard to handle that I ordered this one too quickly, not looking closely at the author. This one by St John of the Cross is a religious treatise that is deep and not that helpful.However, Thomas Moore's book is one I reach for to bring sanity to my troubled soul when life is just too much. It is a spiriritual book, not a religious one, and written by an ex-Monk. I cannot recommend Moore's book high enough. Dont's get confused like I did and order this one instead or you will be very disappointed. ."
1,Dark night of the soul or dark night of the review?,"As a priest, I simply wanted to read dark night of the soul for spiritual enlightenment. That is not what this is."
3,After Reading Other Reviews I'm left wondering.,"After reading several other reviews, I have yet to open my book. Should I read the other books that I would have received as a group had I simply read further down the list more? Should I read more of Teresa of Avila? Her correspondence with St John of the Cross? Read more of Theresa of Liseux? I have read several excellent books on her. Are there any suggestions as to what I might read with this? thank you for any help you might provide."
4,A christian journey into solitude,"When I was baptized as catholic, my mother chose John in spanish Juan, honoring John of The Cross. She wanted me to become a devoted catholic and a priest. Well, God has some humor and I became a christian pastor and a Christ follower. What amazed the most about the life of John of The Cross which I started reading since I was 6 years old, was his search to be devoted follower. The book translated part of his soul seach. He asked hard questions amidst loneliness, and persecution. He had this intimate dialogues with God looking for meaning surrounded by fears and sorrows. I love such intimacy. Be able to talk to God practically face to face. This is not about some mystical experience that happen to a man who chose solitude. This is real daily life for many devoted christians then and now.I'd just can stop reading in it, learning, growing. We all had or will have dark nights of the soul to face in this world."
2,Dark Night,"This book is written in a very pompus style, which detracts from the seriousness of the subject. It is obviously intended to be used in a teaching setting, and is thus written in that very peculiar and cumbersome collegiate text style, which is designed to be confusing for the sake of confusion, as if such a style lends more credibility to the scholar who masters it."
5,the masterpiece by the midnight mystic,"St. John was one of the first mystics I read who helped me see that an experiential relationship with the sacred isn't all joy; instead, it can hurt, stretch into periods of barrenness and shadows...which themselves to the patient penitent eventually stand revealed as the wordless Word itself, darkening the mind as bright light darkens the eyes. I wish I could have met the author."
2,Good content - HORRIBLE translation,"This book really well describes the painful experiences and their significance on the spiritual journey of St. John. However, the translation by E. Allison Peers is absolutely horrible. The translator packages the content into seemingly endless, rambling run-on sentences that seem to go on forever and are terribly difficult to read.If you can find another translation of this book, buy it instead of this book. If this is the only translation available, be prepared to put lots of mental effort into extracting the ideas of St. John from this murky prose."
3,Pastor Brian,I have not yet read this book. I purchased it for a graduate course in spiritual formation.
3,MISSING STUD FINDER,"THE DRILL/DRIVER ARRIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION. HOWEVER, THE STUD FINDER( as advertized ) WAS MISSING FROM THE ORDER. I HAVE TRIED TO REACHYOU SEVERAL TIMES, REGARDING THIS MATTER, TO NO AVAIL.PLEASE SEND ME THIS ITEM, TO COMPLETE THE ORDER, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, PLEASE CALL ME AT 334 297-5057."
3,Who in the production team is a 007 fan?,"Did anyone else noticed that track 16 ""Decisive Battle"" is just a rearrangement (er, rip-off?) of John Barry's ""007""?Although for Japanimation soundtracks I prefer a more ethereal sound such as those done by Yoko Kanno, the music here complemented the series. In fact, without first seeing the series/movies the music can sound rather generic. Yoko Takahashi's strong vocals, however, is worth picking this album up for. Or better yet, see if you can get your hands on the Evangelion song compilation CD ""Refrain""."
1,REI &#65533;T,The room of Gaf means the shelter of lost souls. So Rei Ayanami's soul is the one of lilith and not the one of Yui Ikari. Ritsuko's soul was transfered into the third Rei insted of the Lilith's real soul and Rei's soul was floated in the sky with the one of Kaworu. Ritsuko's soul was disappeared in the sea of LCL with the one of Misato's and Asuka's.
5,Best soundtrack ever!,Has every background song in the entire Evangelion series! The music is great. I dont care for classical but for somereason I do like this classical! Its all around good. I just wish an american company would publish the cd so the price could posibly be lower. [It] is expensive for a music cd.
4,The Evangelion Sound track is awsome!!!!,For people who have seen the Evangelion series you will love this. Music has a lot to do with the mood in the show. Now you can own it! Rei's music is in there witch is really cool. It's a most for Evangelion Fans!!!
4,LP duplicate; could have been better,"After seeing the outstanding film in 1970, I was excited to purchase the soundtrack LP and found it very satisfactory. Alfred Newman's score is brilliant, one of the tops in the history of cinema. The main title in particular is priceless and is justifiably much admired by film fans. The CD duplicates the LP's tracks, but with soundtrack CDs often including previously unreleased material, I was hoping for more from this one. The main title appears to be an alternate take from the superior one used in the film; the same goes for the love theme. I also wish that the CD would have included some additional underscoring. I am not sure which is worse, the liner notes with the LP (none) or with the CD (written by someone who obviously disliked the film and had very little to say about this music). I give this a high rating because the music is great, but unfortunately it may be better appreciated while watching the film."
3,A little disappointing...,"Couldn't wait to get my hands on this CD, as the soundtrack to the movie Airport has always captivated me.The sound quality of the CD is very good, however it is a little short. Additionally, the mix on some of the tracks (notably the title theme, unfortunately) is different to the movie mix, which bits and pieces seeming to be left out.Other than that, not too bad - would like to see a new version from the original session tapes - that's if they exist.(Also, the cover picture should have been from the movie, not the book, but I imagine that's a licensing problem...)"
1,Dead weed...,"The flat, unoriginal music in this boring musical does nothing compared to its flowering rival, Simon's ""The Secret Garden"" (Broadway). Buy the Original Broadway Cast Recording of Lucy Simon's musical, the original is a dead weed."
4,Excellent,"A great book. It is a very thorough study of the life and times of Maulana Azad. It brings out the contrast in the views held by Jinnah and Azad. It is clear, in retrospect, that Azad had a clearer idea of what the future would have in store if the Nation was divided, but that insight got lost somewhere in the loud rhetoric of the proponents of Pakistan. It is a pity that the book was published by OUP Pakistan and OUP India."
1,Why would anyone buy the expurgated versions?,Why would anyone buy the expurgated versions?I just added all of them to my cart and now I have to delete them.WHERE ARE THE ORIGINAL FIRST RUN EPISODES AS SHOWN ON SHOWTIME?What is up with the studio?
1,outer limits season 5,Thank you for letting me know that these were canadian versions and that the quality is inferior to the U.S dvd formats. I will not waste my money buying these seasons. I want to thank the previous reviewers for this feedback. It really opened my eyes.Thank you again!
2,Will the real Outer Limits please stand up?,"I cannot abide by any of the currently available 'New Outer Limits' box sets, collections, etc., with the exception of the Season One MGM box.The syndicated episodes were all edited to make room for commercials as well as to censor certain erotic scenes which wereincluded in the original SHOWTIME airings. 'LITHIA' is the best example of an episode containing erotic scenes both heterosexualas well as explicit lesbianism. Until these uncensored & unedited episodes are available I'm not interested."
2,Night Flight,I was expecting more of a movie-acting picture. My guess would be the actors had to do this movie for a contract fulfillment. Too bad! It could have been a plot for a much better movie.
1,Thai Elephant Orchestra,"Great background ""music"". The songs they play remind me of windchimes on a blustery day. Very calming for me."
5,Musique concrete on safari,"This is surely the most unusual concept for an album that I have ever come across, but the real surprise is that elephant music is accessible and pleasant. Well, let me qualify that; if you like avant-garde music, there's a good chance this will appeal to you. It is easy to forget that 8,000lb pachyderms are making this music, even if they are performing more or less under the direction of a New York musician and academic."
1,"wrong part, shipping to deliver and return 1/3 of total purchase price.","This was not the part that was shown at the top of the page when I was shopping. The part by Jake's buying mistakes was less than half the Amazon part with no supplied picture. I was suspicious with such a price difference but didn't want to argue with a good deal. If they would have supplied a picture it would have been evident I was getting the wrong part. I think the pic. omission was no mistake. They took it back but by the time I paid to ship it back and they deducted their shipping charges, I have $27 invested in nothing. Boo."
5,Greatest Cd EVER!,"This Cd is a masterpiece full of emotion and great music. Some of the best songs are:Mother, Hey You, Don't leave Me Now, and Comfortably Numb.. But those r just my personal favorites..But this cd is just a work of art. Anybody would b happy 2 have this in there collection"
4,Best rock concept album,"""The Wall"" is the best and most cohesive rock concept album so far. It has some classic radio songs like ""Another Brick In The Wall"", some great straightahead songs like ""Mother"", and then several songs which tell the story more than stand up on their own. Like the other Pink Floyd albums, this has well-recorded songs, memorable solos and Dave Gilmour does most of the singing."
5,Great album,"I just ordered the cd, but I think it is great. Gilmour is a genius songwriter and a really good guitarist. Water's lyrics are probably the best I've ever heard.""Comfortably Numb"" is one of my favorite songs of all time.My other favorites were""Hey You,"" ""Another Brick in the Wall Part II,"" ""Young Lust, and""Run like Hell,"" Plus, this album was the third most sold album of all time, next to michael jackson thriller and eagles greatest hits. It sold about 25 million copies. Definetely not a waste of money."
4,i enjoy it,"this album gives me much listening pleasure... great hits like ""goodbye blue sky,"" "" another brick in the wall II,"" ""comfotably numb,"" all incredible recordings, I also suggest watching the movie version of this album, a necessity for the classic rock fan"
5,Unforgettable,"This and ""Physical Graffiti"" are the albums I keep coming back to. I can remember the smell of the album jacket and the scribbled lyrics on the album sleeves back in 1979. I talked my Mom into buying it because she liked Brick Part II. I was 13, and I remember thinking that the guitar in ""Comfortably Numb"" sounded like crying. I had the most boring wasp-y upbringing you could imagine, no angst to speak of, but this album made me sad. I can't think of another album that made me feel like a voyeur into someone's therapy sessions. I like Waters' Wall 1990, but ""The Tide is Turning"" at the end is so out of place. This is not an album for optimism. This is music for a Thomas Hobbes state of mind. Great songs-""Comfortably Numb,"" ""Hey You,"" ""Mother,"" ""Nobody Home."" Not the best album of all time, but one that stays hovering around in your subconscious."
5,Essential recording,"All has been said after more than a thousand review. This is a must have double cd, a great conceptual double album. All kind of musical style, rock (In the Flesh, Young Lust, Run like hell), melodic ballads (Mother, Goodbye blue sky), radio hit (Another brick part II), prog classic (Confortably Numb), classic (The Trial)As Amazon, I agree, this is an essential cd. A must have."
5,This album changed my life forever.,"I was given this album by my uncle in 1980 when i was in the 9th grade. At the time i was listening to country (gasp!) music. Needless to say, i never looked back. In a time when vinyl was king, i played the grooves off two copies. All hail the CD. RIP Syd Barrett."
3,you have to be in the mood,"Whilst the Wall film took itself too seriously, the music version offers a much more pleasurable experience. Besides the singles, there are some real understated gems tucked in here - ""goodbye blue sky"" and ""mother"" - which stand up to the most repeated listens. Aides from these songs, a lot of the album is often too theatrical and only really gels when listened to in its entirity. This isn't Floyd's best and some tracks (the trials) do wear a bit thin after repeated listen. It's more an album you just put on for a few songs."
3,dry at times,"I think when you listen to this you need to understand the concept more then the execution. This is not Pink Floyd and obviously it is a far cry from the original. However, to even attempt to turn an album like the wall into electronic music is worth a listen (wheather you know you'll hate it from the start or not). I think this album was better then I thought it was going to be. Alot of electronic artists cant even play an actual instrument, let alone, be able to tackle a subject like this. I think this cd got dry at times but on the other hand it was a nice change from the typical covers by alternative musicians. And like some of the reviews said, some songs just fall apart quickly."
1,What the f *** is this? why can't you people read?,"I know its a tribute so I went on amazon to litsen to the SAMPLES ( apparantly a firend of mine LIKED this pile of s**t) I litsened to the first song, wich had no words in it ( first 30 secounds) then I listened to the ""Triel"" ( my personal fav.) I puked at least twice!!!! Who do these people think they are! Taking a classic and making it sound like it should be treated like Rasputain. I will buy it and see if it can survive the tourture that I have in store...BETTER YET I'll get the f ***S who ruined it for the future children of Amireca!!!! BURN THE F***S BURN THEM TO HELL!!!!"
4,Not as great as everyone would like you to think,"THE WALL. It's a classic album and but I don't believe it's Pink Floyd at their best. If any other band in the world released an album like this it would be really great. But Pink Floyd can do so much better. Sure, there are great songs like ""Mother"", ""Another Brick In The Wall PT.2"", ""Hey You"", etc. and my vote for the best song of all-time ""Comfortably Numb"", but that being said, there are too many stupid filler songs, it's the only Pink Floyd album that I can't listen to from start to finish. It's not that it's depressing, I listen to Sentenced, try listening to Sentenced and tell me if this album is depressing. No I like slow, sad music, it's just that the album has alot of parts that are very unneccasary. Well, that's enough of my ranting, don't take it from me, listen to it for yourself. All I'm saying is I believe albums like ""Wish You We're Here"" and ""Animals"" are better Floyd pieces than this one."
1,Sound like a man going through a bit of a mid life crises,The singer on this album sounds really quite upset about being a millionaire rock star with lots of fans. If he doesn't like it he should do it anymore rather than moaning on and on.I'm sure he's got enough to retire on anyway. Why doesn't he do what other middle age people do when their wife leaves them and go and buy a Harley and a leather jacket. Failing that watch reruns of Top Gear on Dave or better still read one of those Jeremy Clarkson books and wear Ralph Lauren socks.
2,The Wall is the most degrading album I've ever heard,"I must admitt The Wall does have some(notice the word some) good songs such as Another Brick In The Wall parts 1-3 and Comfortably numb. But there are some very dark themes and racist themes such as in ""Waiting for the Worms"" & ""In the Flesh!"" which has anti-semetisim, and racist and other very derogatory remarks. This was mainly a Roger Waters album, it doesn't sound like Pink Floyd. I am a very big fan of the Floyd and I depise this album. If you want a good album go for either The Division Bell or Dark Side of the Moon."
1,Disappointing,"I received this CD as a gift and I like ""Another Brick in the Wall"". The rest of this very long album is boring. You Pink Floyd fans are a special group. You don't know anything about music, but I guess everyone deserves their opinion. Let's see - there's one good song out of 26 on this album. Therefore, one star out of five seems generous."
2,How many albums can be dedicated to Syd Barrett?,"Of all the grand doubleLP's by the great bands (like ""The White Album,"" ""Electric Ladyland,"" ""Exile on Main Street"" and ""Physical Graffiti""), this is the most bombastic, boring and absurd. Roger Waters seems to have a Syd Barrett fixation. ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and ""Wish You Were Here"" are either blatantly about Syd (""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"") or hint at the pressures of fame and the insanity that fell on Syd. So Waters does a whole double album around this topic, and other ""deep"" things that really just amount to music to go to sleep to. Skip this vastly overrated album and go instead to ""The Piper at the Gates of Dawn"" for the real Pink Floyd--i.e. the Syd Barrett album (I don't have to recommend ""Dark Side"" because everybody has heard it 10,000 times), or go to Waters' Pink Floyd masterpiece ""Wish You Were Here."""
2,Nothing here for the audiophile.,"I bought it but what I really want is Floyd's catalog in the highest fidelity possible. So quit toying with us and release the catalog on HD Tracks at 96kHz/24bit, or better yet - 192kHz/24bit!"
2,No surround sound mix? pass,"Pink Floyd music is made, and was made for surround. Guthrie could have taken an extra couple days and done a 5.1 mix."
5,"Great,terrific,brilliant and stupefying","The wall is one of the best albums made during the classic rock era and ranks only second to the dark side of the moon in greatness.very highly recommended because of songs like comfortably numb,run like hell and another brick in the wall."
3,Only a few good bricks...,"It was really too easy to write an album about being lost and alone in a busy mean world, so lyrical content deserves only 1 star.But WOW, ""Run..."" and ""Comfortably Numb"" are two very good tunes. It is possible to REALLY enjoy this album if you rent and watch the film first. But one or two listens after that you will lose all interest.This is not worth $35.You must open the door. He only knocks.Out."
2,Liberal-anarchistic diarrhea,"Except some good songs and excellent solos of David Gilmour,for me it's a great failure of Pink Floyd.I don't like the lyrics,nor the album's concept idea.It's populistic and doesn't hold the test of time.If I were R.Waters,I would be greatly ashamed of this disc.When fans talk about three big masterpieces of Pink Floyd,alongside with ""The Dark Side of The Moon"" and ""Wish You Were Here"" they include ""The Wall"".Instead of this overated populistic schlock I would include ""Animals"", which is much better.So three real great masterpieces of Pink Floyd are ""The Dark Side of The Moon"",""Wish You Were Here"" AND ""Animals"".Fullstop."
3,Is it the best or worst Pink Floyd?,"""The Wall"" was a very ambitious project. 2/3 of the album is quality Pink Floyd. The rest is, to be nice, NOT.Pro's: Excellent music on every song (occaisionally shaky lyrics)Intelligent story, very bold on Roger Water's part to tell his own story.Full length songs. They incorporated Pink Floyd's flowing style and genius lyrics, Especially ""Comfortably Numb"" and ""Hey You"" and ""Run Like Hell"".Con's: The story is not clear enough. Unless somebody tells it to you, it is very muddled.The short songs. They are only there to briefly fill people in on the story, and are very rushed. Except Vera, it's very good."
2,Almost As Bad As the Movie,"1 great song (Comfortably Numb) and 1 okay song (Another brick in the Wall. I imagine the rest was written during a stay at an insane asylum. Too weird, too annoying. I've been told its great to listen to stoned, unfortunately i'd rather not have to have my senses impaired to enjoy music. You want great Pink Floyd, stick with Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here."
5,why don't hue all go and buy Mike Oldfield records??,"Hey ho friends why don't hue all go the %^$! out and buy Mikeo a theme song.Mikeoldfield has also made muct exist no more, unlike Mikeoldfield who is still given his best shots making new and interesting Mikeoldfield CDs.Long live Mikeoldfields!Hh97er"
5,The Last Few Bricks Of The Wall,"Originally, The Wall was (as is my knowledge) intended to be an album, stage production, and a film. The brainchild of Roger Waters was and is considered to be the most comprehensive and intricate works based on a concept (despite its striking similarity to The Who's ""Tommy""). Ladened with stories of war, longing, and the oppressive English school system, Roger Waters' lyrics paint a colourful picture. From the kick-off of ""In The Flesh?"" The Wall is a classic. Another Brick In The Wall (part 2), Mother, Young Lust, Hey You, Comfortably Numb, and the ever-pleasing crowd favorite Run Like Hell are the most well-known. But aside from these songs, The Wall has many other gems, that act almost all act as segues to the next. If you're just getting into Pink Floyd, The Wall is a ""deafinite"" choice, along with Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, the less-known Animals, and if you like the spacey, more jamming stuff, even Ummagumma."
5,Yumm,I dont even like this type of music.. I like Techno.. But this album is amazing... It's almost ambient... I wish I had it on Vinyl so much ! It contains so much emotion! Its more a work of art then an album.. Each song seems carefully arranged to give the right effect...ohh its great
1,Duped!,"Ok, the box and trinket contents are on par with the other Immersion sets, but we have all been shafted by this release. Yes, the CDs sound good (better than the original release), but for $120, we should have AT LEAST received hi-resolution Stereo 96KHz/24bit. Instead, we got 7 discs of the same old stuff....no offense to James Guthrie intended.I humbly request a complete revolt on this product until it comes with a DVD-A or Blu-Ray w/hi-rez audio. In the end, it's the SOUND I care about and not the silly box.Back it goes until a better sounding one is released."
2,High Priced for what is actually there,"For what is in the box, it should have been about 50 bucks or so. There are NO surround sound mixes or any kind of upgraded audio, so I feel a bit cheated for the amount of money spent. The music that is included is good, but not worth the asking price. Skip it, buy the other Immersion sets instead which do have surround sound mixes, etc."
5,"""A Kid"" is dumb. This album rules.","This ignorant fool known as ""a kid"" must be combatted in his pathetic efforts. I urge everyone to rally forth and give this album the praise it deserves. Ignorance is a disease, and this guy has it. Fight the power, now!"
4,they WILL draw you in,"i was wary of buying this album,because i have not been much of a pink floyd fan before. i'm more guns n' roses, aerosmith, that type. but just two days ago i finally broke down and bought it because i've been hearing from one of my best friends how wonderful and perfect it is. and he was right. it's a little wierd when you first listen to it if you've never heard it before, but it is pure musical genius.i finally sat down and listened to disc two(disc one fell out of my car and broke; so i'm online buying it AGAIN because i HAVE to have all of it, and i'm finally having a better understanding of it. it's incredible. as my friend adam said, it will draw you in. and it did."
5,The most beautiful masterpiece,"Pink Floyd The Wall isn't an album. Is a part of everyone's life. Touch many aspect of life, like isolation, alienation, sorrow, lies, broken dreams, marriage, chilhood, self-destruction, etc. That's the reason why The Wall has been, and still is and will be forever, the most important piece of music, even beyond Rock music, from all times. The most finest concept album ever made by a band or an artist. The most powerful lyrics ever written. The most extraordinary music for that lyrics, etc.The Wall is an experience. How many albums or artist are really an experience nowadays ? U2 ? they died in 2000... Eminem ? ... Britney Spears ?... Robbie Williams ?...This is not an album, this is a life experience.I really hope someday will have Pink Floyd The Wall Live DVD"
4,Great sound!!,"Just wanted to add to the other reviews that this SOUNDS GREAT!! If you are looking for a great remastered version of this album (as i was) this is it! I admit i have not heard the past digitized ones as i only had the vinyl version previous to this cd but it sounds just amazing. i don't think you can improve any more (unless you go with Audio dvd or Blue ray). Of course, the music is great from the last classic Pink Floyd formation."
3,Pink Floyd The Wall - Experience Version,"What happened to Comfortably Numb - song number six on Disk Two? Sounds great until it gets pretty much truncated (volume goes very quickly to zero), what a shame! Everything else is perfect!"
5,The demo CD is something fantastic.,"The disk 1 and 2 do not require comment, as it topped the charts in the United States, France, Germany, Sweden and Australia when it was released. ""Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2"" became a hit, selling over a million copies in a few weeks after launch, now the demo CD is without doubt a wonderful news and he was alone worth the expense to the album, it brings a side of ""the Wall"" I did not know."
2,Worst remaster of The Wall,"This seems to be the worst master of the wall to my ears. The best you can trust is Japan 1st press 50DP and 40DP or even MFSL 24 karat gold cd. For those you did not know there're way better sound quality of the wall before they were remastered again and again in 1994, 1997 and 2011. Hunting down the old master while you still can."
2,Doesn't stand up to what people say!,"After trying to listen to this album a numerous amount of times, I still find it doesn't even compare to the aura and music, The Beatles White Album, now that's a double album worth buying!!!!!"
3,Overrated,"This is what happens when egos, drugs, and growing fame all collide. Let's be honest, there is no reason that this needed to be a two disc affair. Some of what is here is absolutely amazing and I think this whole package would benefit greatly had they not become so overindulgent. However it is what it is, so I had to be honest and give it three stars. Nearly every album they released before this one makes this look small and weak. One would be much better served starting at the beginning and work their way towards this one chronologically. (Instead of the other way around like most seem to do now) This was kinda a last call type of deal, where as ""Wish You Were Here"" and ""Meddle"" were triumphant expressions of art."
3,The ultimate High School Album and Skating Song,"This is, judging by the semi literate reviews I'm reading, still the ultimate high school album. But let's face it, the album's a downer. Lots of songs about how much Roger Water's life as a child of the war and a veteran of a rock band really sucks. The album used to have some hidden meaning to me. I thought it was so great. Now, 12 years after I first purchased a copy......... Not so good. To me, The Final Cut (which few Floyd fans seem to like) was much more genuine in its rage and fury. As for other comments here, SKIP DIVISION BELL AND MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON. These are PINK FRAUD! Dark Side of the Moon remains their best album. Take it from me kids, this is a band you will grow out of. But enjoy them while you can. Can anyone comment on how the remaster sounds??"
4,"""If you want to find out whats behind these cold eyes""","The Wall is a masterpeice in many ways, In terms of Art and Creativity there is few ""compilations"" that come close. The Wall is story of madness and insanity brought on by old memories and Experiences, which in simple terms causes the character in ""The Wall"" to build a virtual wall between himself and the outside world. The story takes you in and out of the very depths of darkness with the combination of amazing guitar work and well done vocals. The problem with the Wall however is that to really get the enjoyment the album has to offer you must listen to it more as one big peice of music which can be annoying at times. The plot is also very hard to understand at first and It's not a bad idea to watch the movie as well as listen to the album to understand it, But even so it still has it's grand moments like ""Comfortably Numb"" ""Mother"" and ""Hey You."""
3,The Wall,This is a very good remaster of the original album. I would definately recommend it for any Pink Floyd fan.
3,"Not Floyd's best,","This is the first Floyd album I heard; and I have to admit that I was enthralled when I first heard it. It has some really good songs like Comfortably Numb and Hey You but taken in comparison to how many songs where actually on the album and the cumalitive quality of previous albums (especially Animals, Dark Side and Meddle) I feel comfortable giving this album 3 stars.The music on this album, overall, was simply not as good as on previous albums. Animals for instance, is much shorter with only five songs but the music, in my opinion, is captivating. I say the same for Dark Side of the Moon, Meddle and the live disc off Ummagumma."
3,Overrated,"In high school I, like about 65% of high school students in the English-speaking world, thought this was one of the greatest albums ever. It really seemed to capture the isolation, passion, and despair of those years. I'm a little older now, and I have come to realize that this album is an emotionally immature, irrational, and fairly mediocre (for Floyd) piece of work. It's better than, say, ""Animals"" or any of the post-Watters stuff, but nowhere near as good as ""Wish You Were Here"", let alone ""Dark Side"". A good album, but one that seems a lot less good once you grow out of it. Strangely (this isn't the case with most bands), Floyd's earlier work would be better for a serious, thoughtful music fan."
4,The Best to Party With,"I grew up listening to this album and I think it is one on the best that floyd ever made, I recommend the album to anyone who is a true floyd fan."
3,An overrated album....,"First off, I love Floyd, but I feel as though Dark Side should have been their last, after that it was mostly egos running wild. This album does have the highlights, but I feel this is the most commercial Pink Floyd album out there. Another Brick In The Wall gets too much airplay, to make even more complaints, it gets played just about every day. Young Lust is alright. Is Anybody Out There has got to be my highlight on this album, love the acoustic guitar on this gig. But like I said, too much airplay, Pink Floyd should have stayed a little more in the underground."
3,You missed the point.,"This is probably my least favorite work by my favorite band in the history of all mankind. There was no jamming on this album whatsoever... no chance to get lost in the music. To many people, Pink Floyd stopped being Pink when Waters left. I thought think it was a blessing in disguise. After he took off, we got Momentary Lapse of Reason and Division Bell, which got back to the psychedlic, jamming ""I listen to this after drinking a bottle of cough syrup"" sound. I think that if a Pink Floyd fan tells you that The Wall is their favorite ablum, they have completely missed the point."
5,God-like,This is the stuff that makes me wonder if god really is there because music like this is consumate. Pink floyd are deities and this album is proof of their brilliance. I am 18 - Brilliant music doesn't die.
3,Don't believe the fans......,"One of the most overrated so-called classics ever...I think that it is overall a good album with some fine moments but i definitely wouldn't rate it as a masterpiece : too long and too pretentious. Another thing that i don't understand is how so many persons can find it subtle and scary when half of the album just sounds boring and self-indulgent to me...Worth buying, though, if you really like Pink Floyd but i guess anybody who like Pink Floyd already has it..."
5,a masterpiece,"the wall was their second best album after the dark side of the moon and was so good that it sold over 22 million copies all over the world on the strengths of songs like comfortably numb,run like hell and another brick in the wall.a must buy for all rock fans"
3,Missing items,Our set was missing letters for the cardboard coasters. Cant spell PINK FLOYD with them...its quite sad... where do i go to get my other letters?
2,It ain't Floyd,"While the cd's have some good tracks on them, this remix of the wall seemed to loose the album.Any big time Pink Floyd fan will have a hard time listening to this album, as the vocals transmit an entrily different message then the original. The flow from track to track that you found on the original work was also lost.Those people who have only one or two Floyd cd's might be interested if you like remixed stuff.Whatever you do, don't buy this CD to add to your Floyd collection... it's not Floyd."
1,What a cluster of disorganization!!!,"Amaxon does it again. It is grouping the comments from ..... The Wall - Immersion Box Set, The Wall (2011 - Remaster MP3), The Wall (2011 - Remaster), The Wall (2000), and The Wall- Experience Version together as one review. The comments are all the same for each product. So someone is complaining that the movie is not included with the Experience Version - well, it is not supposed to be. It is a two CD set. That is all. How confusing for someone who is looking for what they want. What is Amaxon doing or better yet, why are they doing it this way? There should be a different review for each bar coded version. With all this distortion, I am just going to keep my original version and save my money. The Sony version still sounds great!"
3,Not bad,"I didn't feel like the band broke any new ground with this remake, although their Dark Side of the Moon and Animals remakes were really good. This is still a fairly decent CD.Alan"
2,Not As Good As I Thought....,"'The Wall 2000' is only a tribute album from the band 'Out Of Phase.' It Hardly Sounds Anything Like Pink Floyd. It's Like A Combination Of Techno Mixed With Rock. All Of The Songs Have A Techno-Funk Style To Them. A Few Of Songs Are Decent, But Most Of Them Are Too Much Like A Limp Bizkit/Korn-Type Of Style. I Would Not Really Recommed This Album To Any One Who Is Just A Basic Floyd Album Collecter. This One Is Mainly For EXTREMLY HARD-CORE Pink Floyd Finanics."
5,My favorite album of all time.,"The Wall is intelligent and awesome. I wish more bands would produce concept albums, rather than dumping a bunch of unrelated stuff onto a CD and pushing it out the door. I love every second and can listen to it straight thru, time after time."
5,A ever lasting classic!!! 5 STARS!!!,"No question about it, this album is better then their previous classic THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON. This album is like a greatest hits album! This album features ""Comfortably Numb,"" ""Hey you,"" Another Brick in the Wall,"" ""Nobody Home,"" ""Don't Leave Me Now,"" ""Mother,"" ""The Trial,"" ""Run Like Hell,"" etc... When I listened to the album, THE WALL, I thought this album was nothing compared to other Pink floyd albums, but after a few days it grew on me. I love the whole album and I've listened to the album...what a hundred times. I just started listening to Pink floyd, by the way.I rate this ***** out of *****"
3,WARNING-NO YOUNG LUST!,"Just a friendly warning-For those of you who, like me, have listened to this album a million times, it's quite jarring when Empty spaces abruptly ends...This Chinese import is otherwise a beautiful set, but I guess in China, YOUNG LUST in just unacceptable-I just can't help think that considering that the song content itself is not all that offensive-the title term is never actually sung-someone could have instead just translated the title to something like ""Young Groupie""....."
2,CENSORED CHINESE VERSION,"Read the track listing: ""Young Lust"" has been removed from the album by the Chinese government which makes this version the worst ever. Maybe living in the USA isn't so bad after all..."
3,Don't be fooled - this masterpiece is missing one important song.,"I think most people looking to buy this product already know The Wall is a masterpiece, and know it is a story of a boy named (or nicknamed) Pink, his childhood, his rise to fame as a rockstar, and ultimately his fall from grace as a result of a nervous breakdown and drug addiction. For more complete reviews, see the original release of this CD which contains over 1000 reviews.Unfortunately, this Chinese release of The Wall is missing the song Young Lust. Upon receiving this CD, I was saddened to realized this fact and The Wall as a whole seemed incomplete. If you are someone who has never listened to The Wall, I would still have to recommend one of the other versions - one of the complete versions with all 26 songs.If you are a collector who enjoys different versions of The Wall, then perhaps this has a place in your collection. Otherwise, I would skip it."
3,To much of roger waters is not a good thing,"There is no doubt that The Wall has been a huge success since it was released in 1979.But I have never been able to consider this a true Pink Floyd album.This is a Waters project,with pink floyd as session musicians. Its boring,depressing,and sloppy. The biggest draw back for me is waters nasal and whiney vocals.Is it any surprise that the biggest hits are the ones Gilmour sang? Its also extremly long and I cant sit through two cds of waters singing. If it wasn't for Gilmour this might be what Dark Side would have sounded like."
3,Uhhh..,"Ya gotta be kiddin me, right.? I just downloaded this and played it in it's entirety. The transitions are all hosed up and if I'm not mistaken ""as it comes"" it's all out of order as well. Definitely not the flowing ALBUM I grew up listening to. Sound quality is OKish. Annoying."
3,Uncomfortably Numb,"When I bought my copy of the Wall in 1997 (the year I graduated from high school) I was enthralled with it. I thought it was a great album, perhaps one of the greatest albums of all time. However over the years I began to lose interest. I used to be able to listen to the whole thing in one sitting, but not any more. I still think Disc One is generaly good. As for Disc Two the only songs I still listen to are ""Hey You"", ""Comfortably Numb"", ""Run Like Hell"", and sometimes ""Waiting for the Worms"".I finally came to realize how overdone, over produced, and over hyped this album is. However, ""Comfortably Numb"" is still one of my favorite Songs. David Gilmour's solo alone deserves five stars. Unfortunatly it is the unnecessary fillers that made me give the Wall a three star rating."
1,Disgrace to Floyd,This is a version of the wall not even played by floyd. It is remixed with tencho tracks and is terrible. I made the mistake of buying it. I do not recommend buying it
2,Not a good Floyd ablum,"I have always been able to enjoy Pink Floyd as one of the most successful experimental bands -Piper, Dark Side, Wish... etc. BUT this album combines a not-so-good storyline with music that sounds like almost pop 80s. This is not the band of old. It marked a change in FLoyd, one that they never would recover from. They totally blew the great idea of creating a rock opera with songs that are boring and annoying, like Run LIke Hell. Its really too bad that money was wasted on making a movie on this project. A movie should have been made about Peter Gabriel's masterpiece ""The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway""-a story with so many musical levels. It is the true quintessential ""rock opera"""
3,A BIT TO MUCH SELF PITY,I remember when I was a teenager I spent a horrible depressing anerexic summer listening to this album while drowning in self pity. I guess its okay if you like self pity but now i find most of it extremely whiney and pompous. I do still like Another Brick in the Wall and the Trial and Comfortably Numb.
2,If,"If you can get past the rock opera thing, you can listen to some good individual songs, like 'Run Like Hell' and 'Comfortably Numb.' If you know what this album is all about, either you're really good at this kind of thing, or you forgot to switch on your s*** detector."
1,Peter Mossman - did you get Roger Waters permission?,"just curious. did you get permission specifically from Roger Waters himself (not Sony or EMI or Columbia or whoever)? if you did, i'll go buy it. if not, i will be decent and not post here what i think of your 'band'."
5,Gilmore's best guitar ever and Pink's 3rd best,"This album is full of kick-... songs like In The Flesh, My Young Lust (Aswome guitar from Gilmore), Mother, Hey You, Another Brick In The Wall (One of the best Pink songs ever), Run Like Hell (The opening minute is some of the best music I've ever heard from Pink), Waiting For The Worms, Is Anybody Out There?,and save the best for last, Comfortably Numb, the best Pink song of all time, Gilmore's best solo ever, perfect lyics from both Waters and Gilmore(I've memorized the whole song). This is to me a very large piece of Water's never-ending tribute to Barrett. Everytime I listen to the whole thing I feel like destroying something. This is by far the album that is enflunenced by Waters the most with his obssession with insanity. Probably the 3rd best concept albums next to Dark Side and Wish. Aswome album."
1,"You Don't Get It, Do You?","This is the story of a rock star who is burned out on fame and begins hating his audiences. To show his disdain he begins giving them absolute trash, and they don't know the difference.Irony, thy name is Waters."
1,not like it!,the songs are too simpel! we need better songs! it is good if you have radio and listen to 'we do'n need no education'. we have heard it several times! please STOP IT!
2,Not the Worst,"""The Wall"" is actually a pretty good song with its driving bass and distorted guitar. Nevertheless, true to form, they ruin it at the end with the screeching voice saying ""you won't get any pudding!"" Why did these guys find it so hard to just be normal?"
1,WHAT MASTERPIECE?,"From the moment i heard the horrible song ""Mother"" i didn't want to hear any more of this band.But,unfortunatly my friend was listening to this cd and as i thought,this cd was really bad.I don't really know why people like Pink Floyd.All of the songs are slow,boring,and i couldn't find the ""message"" that people say it has.After my listening experience of a half hour of PinkFloyd i don't want to hear it again."
1,The Rot,"In the development of rock, this album reached a new nadir, and believe me, it had lots of competion from Led Zepplin, Yes, Free, and all the other stadium fodder. Where did all the excitement go? The creation and release of rythmic tension which had been rock's signature? Instead we find lyrics with a pretension to depth, and which are in fact staggeringly banal. We find music of leaden obviousness. The antidotes? Dylan, Neil Young, The Band, The Clash, The Sex Pistols. You know, music with a pulse, instead of musical necrophilia."
2,just not the same,"I am not a music critic, but I do like Pink Floyd. I got this for my birthday and when I began I did not realize it was not PF. I am horrible at knowing music, but it didn't take me long at all to realize this was off. The sound is not as strong, the beats are different, and the voice is flatter. THEN I got to the 2nd disc. I was listening to my favorite song and it did not sound like it was supposed to at all. In fact it was quite a bad take. From that point on the songs were a little off key (to me at least) and nothing like the orginals. I agree with one of the previous reviews that there is not the same feeling as you get with Waters. Not even close."
2,Are there two remastered versions?,"First of all there's no dispute that this is a great album. I would give it 4 stars,but this review is not about album content but the remastering of it. I had a cassette version and wanted to buy the remastered version from the year 2000. I received the CD that was remastered in 1994. I know there is a difference because when I set my car CD player dial at 11 o""clock I get the maximum sound but when it's not remastered I do not get sufficient sound at that level. I ask the question: Are there two different remastered copies (1994 & 2000) or is The Wall just a victim of bad remastering?"
3,"If you love The Wall, ""Rebuild!""","O.K. We are all familiar with The Wall and have heard it played endlessly for twenty years now. Wouldn't you like to hear this music through fresh ears? How about if the songs from The Wall were played at a fast pace and on acoustic instruments? What if new arrangements set up the lyrics to make them clearer and more understandable than ever? Sound intriguing? Then check out Luther Wright and the Wrongs as they ""Rebuild the Wall."" Released in 2002, ""Rebuild the Wall"" should appeal to fans of Pink Floyd's wall as well as to any lovers of good music."
2,A Few Redeeming Qualities,"I consider myself to be a fairly large Pink Floyd fan. But, odd as it may seem, this album is one that I heard after all of the others.Like the title of my review indicates, I hold that this album has only a few redeeming qualities. While songs such as ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part II"" and ""Hey You"" would obviously be qualified as redeeming qualites, it possesses a few others. Mother and Comfortably Numb are both enjoyable songs, as well as the short Vera, which, I personally would prefer to be a little, if not alot, longer.I give it two stars because it is not anything like the musical genious portrayed in Dark Side of the Moon and a few of their other albums. I would not go as far as to reccommend this album to anyone."
5,the best,this cd is so the shit as is anything that pink floyd makes roger waters is the most insperational singer songwriter of the 20th century buy this disk
2,"So very, very, overrated","I didn't grow up with The Wall,... It manages to be pretentious, boring and irritating all at the same time. Read other reviews for details. I dare you to find one erson who didn't hear this in high school who likes it now. 2 stars for Run Like Hell, Comfortably Numb and Brick II. Get Dark Side of the Moon instead of this."
3,Dissapointing,"After my interest in Pink Floyd began, my mom told me about The Wall. I immediately ordered it and was quite dissapointed. It seemed so dark and gloomy compared to Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. However, ""Comfortabely Numb"" is an awesome song, and almost makes it worth getting the whole thing. ""The Show Must Go On"" is good too."
3,The Wanking Wall,"Roger Waters rode on the coat-tails of Syd Barrett and managed to sustain a career by rehashing his (and John Lennons) ideas. The only cool Floyd were the space jams and that was mostly because of Rick Wright after Syd was gone. The wall is a look into the human condition of self pity. Definitely worth the trip, but who has time to listen to something that in depth now a days, besides the wall has already beem torn down (thanks to this album).This is actually all said in irony. Typical Waters fasion. Ofcourse this album was the easiest album to relate to ever. Iwas certainly hypnotized by it for a year or more, but c'mon,Floyd fan to Floyd fan: this album is not pink floyd. It is Rogerand Bob Ezrin.Rick Wright was such an enormous part of what Pink Floyd was.Even Syd saw that. This album changed the face of our planetall together, coincidentally it destroyed the best band thereever was."
2,A lot of trash for a lot of money,"I thought perhaps it would be interesting to see what the extra stuff sounds like. Well, don't waste your time, it is garbage. Buy the digital remaster released earlier instead."
4,Not their best,"It really irritates me when people say that this is Pink Floyd's best album. It's not. Don't get me wrong, there is some very good songs on it such as Comfortably Numb and Another Brick in the wall 2 but it is not as strong all the way through as some of their other albums. There are just too many drab songs and Water's moaning and complaining gets old. I think it could have been alot better if Waters would have let some of the other band members do more of the writing. Pink Floyd was always at their best when they every member of the band was envolved in the writing. Albums like Wish You Were Here come to mind. Every member was envolved in the writing and the result was a far superior album. So if you're new to the band buy Wish You Were Here or Dark Side of the Moon first."
5,The greatest CD by far ever produced,This CD brought out the best of Pink Floyd's abilitiy with a mixture of heavy classical rock with some softer mellow tunes all in all this CD is a bang for your buck
5,I LOVE this album!,"While this album is a bit on the dramatic side and is a rock opera of sorts, it is definitely a Pink Floyd classic, not to be overlooked. So many great songs on this album, a real thrill from beginning to finish. It's just great and any fan of rock/Pink Floyd should have it. It's a timeless classic."
5,Masterpiece,"I was about 16 when this album was released, it became an anthem for me and my friends. The album and then the film transformed our lives and we didn't even know it at the time. All we really knew is that it was very, very good and we knew then (even as teens) that it was a masterpiece. The last great collaboration by the four remaining members post-Barrett. The Wall wasn't meant to be radio-friendly, however, the decaying AOR stations made many of the individual songs radio-friendly by means of minimal editing. Anyone who knows this work can tell you that any one song taken from the album can stand alone but the original color is lost if not consumed as a whole with all the parts intact.No need to go on-and-on about this cornerstone of modern pop music, just give it a listen, judge for yourself."
2,Not good value for money for big Floyd fans,"I love floyd but i think this is a big rip off for the price. The first two discs are basically last years remasters, the next 2 are a re-release of the live ""Is there anybody out there"" from 2000, quality is more or less the same, slightly better. The 4th and 5th discs are great and DVD is ok. So essentially, only real floyd fans are going to buy this and they will already have discs 1-4, so they are paying big money for 2 cds and dvd basically.If you never had the Wall its probably reasonable value, still think its over priced"
3,Not for critical listening,"This album is one of the greatest, ever. That goes without saying. What probably does NOT go without saying is that there is some shoddy work going into ""remastering"" efforts these days. Even casual listeners may wonder why tape hiss wasn't removed from this recording, but what really bugs me is that there is audible clipping (distortion) at several of the louder points. Absolutely ridiculous. I heard it through my expen$ive home studio monitors AND through my expensive headphones. Just to be sure what I was hearing wasn't a bug in MY system, I spoke to a friend several states away who purchased this, and he had the same experience.So...if you are just a casual listener who is going to pop this into your car stereo and sing to it at the top of your lungs (yes, I do this, too!), then fine--it's probably ""good enough."" But, for serious listeners? Forget it! Wait until they do a better job--whenever that may be..."
3,Nothing new here.,"This set is not like the previous immersion sets. No surround or super high fidelity stuff. Just the same The Wall and The Wall Live discs, remastered to Roger Waters' high standards. Which is great. But for this kind of money, one would expect some new recordings of these songs. Discs 5 & 6 are filled with mostly snippets of the raw, unpolished ""demos"" that were the basis for the songs we all recognize. Honestly, they suck, and I can't, for the life of me, understand why Mr. Waters would even want us to hear them. Here is an opportunity for him to share with his fans some of the miles and miles of tape he has from all the concerts Pink Floyd performed. But no, not even one song! If you are looking for something new, don't look here. If you want the remastered versions of these two albumns, then, by all means, buy it. Come on Roger, share a little!"
5,pink floyd's finest hour,i would highly recommend you this classic containing two discs of the finest music ever made which was one of the largest selling rock albums ever worldwide.this phenomenally selling cd contained the chart topping single another brick in the wall and comfortably numb one of the greatest rock songs ever made.highly recommended.
2,2011 The Wall,"Couldn't wait to get this but was very dissappointed. I suggest buying the SAX remaster before it becomes unavailable. First Remaster ever where I have to say it is not loud enough. Sax version has much more punch. That being said I believe the DSOTM, WYWH, and ANIMALS do sound better on 2011 version. Not sure what went wrong on The Wall....I am extremely disappointed."
3,The Wall,"Facts- Two discs, 26 tracks. Features ""Another Brick in the Wall, part 2"", ""Comfortably Numb"", ""Hey You"", ""Run Like Hell"", and ""Young Lust"". All songs written by Roger Waters.Opinion-I don't want to write long. I just want to say three things:1. If you are curious because of all the talk, check it out. If you go into it with moderate expectations, you will likely see what all the buzz is about.2. This is my least favorite Pink Floyd album.3. The songs are incredibly sad and morose. Make sure you have some sort of human contact immediately after you listen to this album."
2,The Wall,"Great music! However, not happy about not being able to load the first disk onto my computer. Sent the first one back and had the same problem with the replacement. Disk 2 loads fine. Now I can't put the first disk on my MP3 player."
3,I'll go on record and say this..,"The Wall is by far the most overrated album of all time.It's essentially a Roger Waters solo album with Pink Floyd playing the music. It lacks soul and lacks emotion in my opinion. It has a lot of great songs on it. I'll even say that Disc 1 is almost entirely consistent, but there was a lot of filler on this album, and calling it Floyd's best is almost an insult because by then, it was Roger Waters and Pink Floyd."
2,Self-indulgent and tiresome.,"If I wanted to hear a rock star feel sorry for himself for 2 hours, I would have become a psychiatrist. There is about 15 minutes total of good music, the rest is basically filler. I find the album's whiny, self-pitying tone infuriating -- if he hates performing so much, then let him stay home! Pink Floyd's earlier albums are much more satisfying in every way."
2,It's all about the Benjamins,"Why they couldn't put the entire Wall on one cd (it is 2012!) and then put the live versions on the other two cds? No one is going to listen to these demos more than once. The other 2 Experience editions are worthwhile, but again, why not some live material on the earlier albums? Live material from some old tv specials could have been backed on More or Meddle - just as one example. I've been listening to Pink Floyd since the 1st album, which we had to buy as an Import when it first came out, so I'm an old-time fan. I'd give the Wall 5 stars in general but not this. The one good thing I can say is you can buy all the basic 2011 remasters at a decent price."
5,The best Pink Floyd album ever.,"One of the greatest songs ever ""HEY YOU"". This album is one of the greatest because the music isn't physcodelic like other albums. The music is great and truely a masterpiece. I've collected most of their CD's and this is the best one yet. Also you should buy ""The Wall"" movie."
1,Boring!,I don't know why everyone likes this cd. I think it is more of a Roger Waters solo cd than a pink floyd cd. Only about 2 songs are good if that. Those are by David Gilmour. I really never listen to this cd. It's way overrated. Overall I don't reccommend it. I prefer Pre Dark side Floyd.
1,The worst record of all time,First thing this is not rock music the songs are so slow.Gilmor is the worst guiter player and a bad singer.
1,Pure swag,"Pretentious, boorish and silly. For stoned high school kids only. Get Meddle and Saucer Full of Secrets instead."
1,Overrated in the extreme,"Pompous, overblown, and pretentious, ""The Wall"" is one of the most overrated albums in history by one of the most overrated bands in history. I guess that makes this album and ""the Floyd"" consistent, but this is hardly a plus. Forget this arty junk and stick with real rock & roll."
1,what?,"Aw, come on, people! This has to be THE most overblown, all-around unlistenable album ever released, not to mention ballyhooed and blathered on about by clueless rock critics everywhere and bought by who knows how many millions of people! Pink Floyd's formula - snail-paced epics, long guitar solos, pseudo-profound nonsense lyrics - cloys after 10 minutes; did anyone actually sit all the way through ANIMALS, and now THE WALL? Maybe I'm missing something. How can I go against the grain like this when the songs ('Comfortably Numb,' 'Part 2') are undeniably staples of classic rock radio? At any rate, in the thick of it I'll stick to my convictions: I didn't like FORREST GUMP and I don't like Everclear and I don't like THE WALL!"
4,"PRETTY GOOD, BUT DEFINITELY NOT THEIR BEST","This album is really not as good as you may hear, it certainly doesn't hold a candle to WISH YOU WERE HERE (which is my personal favorite) or ANIMALS. There are some very impressive tracks from THE WALL, but not enough to be called Pink Floyd's greatest album. There are too many sketchy points in this album, it's not as strong or as consistent as some of their earlier works. I find myself skipping through most of the songs because either they're too bland and insipid, or they're exactly like the song I just heard. Some of the highlights of THE WALL are ""In the Flesh"", ""Hey You"", and ""Goodbye Blue Sky"". I'm not saying THE WALL is horrible or even bad, I'm just saying that this is not the first Pink Floyd album you should go for. I think that you should get familiar with Pink Floyd before you listen to THE WALL, only fans of Pink can truly appreciate it."
3,Overblown concept album,"While the album does have some great songs (basically anything one will here on rock/classic rock radio), as a piece it is well overdone. It would not be a problem if the concept allowed for more actual songs, but many of the songs are mere snippets designed to carry the story, rather than the album. I'm not putting down the story, which is definately interesting, but the album actually works better in the movie. The brief songs are like filler. If one wants a double album with a story, the Who's QUADROPHENIA is a better buy."
5,Best Eipic Album to Date,"Well the only thing to say about this masterpeice is that it kicks major arse, and hits all the high points that rock n roll lives up to."
5,THE BEST ALBUM ... THE BEST VIDEO,"This is THE #1 album of all time. NOBODY beats PINK FLOYD! The movie ""Pink Floyd: The Wall"" should have gotten an ACADEMY AWARD and I rate the movie 5 stars, also!"
5,Greatest Ever,"This is hands- down the best album ever. The story, the vocals, and most importantly the music is wonderful. The price is steep, but it is so well worth it. Listen to this in track order otherwise you won't get it. THANK GOD FOR PINK FLOYD."
3,Average,"To make a long review short, THE WALL is somewhat disappointing. The album is overrated, and definitely not their best work. Still, a mediocre Floyd album is leaps and bounds superior than almost everything else in the store. Also keep in mind that I gave it three stars because I'm judging it by the standards established by their previous work."
5,One of the most extream range of mood pieces of music.,The Wall has some of the best instramentally skilled work Pink Floyd has ever recorded and the prodiction and recording /mixing quality is fantasic. Roger Waters and David Gilmore are working together like never before. Some of the most expressive music released to date. For those exploring the psycadellic music this is one album to explore. And for those who are familliar with Pink Floyd this is a musical Climax.
5,MASTERPIECE BY FAR,"EQUAL TO BEATLES SGT PEPPER, BEACH BOYS PET SOUNDS,WHO'S TOMMY AND PREVIOUS FLOYD ALBUM DSOTM. ROGER WATERS'BRILLIANT CREATION OF A POP STAR GONE MAD. A MUST FOR FLOYD FANS"
5,Greatest Rock Album of All Time,"This album is Roger Waters at the height of his lyric abilities. Hits like ""Hey You"" and ""Run Like Hell"" only scratch the surface of the true driving emotion behind the lyrics. The music augments the emotional height of the album. Listen to it with loud speakers and plenty of volume. Lose yourself in the music, the lyrics that define an era, and the quick but paced beat that allows you to discover what it is that makes Pink Floyd what they are. This is the greatest album from the greatest band ever!!!!"
1,Never got it.,"I don't and haven't seen what the big deal is with this band, they sound like a crap rock band, and this comes from a ROCK/Metal fan to the core and I mean real music not nu-crap rock."
2,Overrated CD,"This CD has to rank as one of the most overrated CDs of all time. Overproduced, pretentious, and depressing Roger Waters' arrogance permeates throughout the work.This 2-CD set could easily have been condensed into one CD. It has exactly four good songs: ""Another Brick In The Wall Part I"", ""Comfortably Numb"", ""Young Lust"", and ""Run"".There are far better Pink Floyd CDs than ""The Wall"" including ""Dark Side of the Moon"", ""Wish You Were Here"", ""Animals"", ""Meddle"", ""Pink Floyd"", and ""Echoes, Best of Pink Floyd"".If you want excessive, pretentious CDs that are well done, buy something like Queen's ""A Night At the Opera"", Yes' ""Close To the Edge"", Emerson Lake and Palmer's ""Brain Salad Surgery"", or Rick Wakeman's ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"". If you want two CDs of Roger Waters whining, then ""The Wall"" is for you."
2,Doesn't Hold Up,"None of Pink Floyd's albums really justify the hype, and this one is no exception. Individually, the song ""The Wall"" is appealing, but there isn't much else that really creates a desire to play this repeatedly. That said, it's definitely better than the tremendously overhyped Dark Side of the Moon, but still doesn't stand up to the achievements of the better artists of that era. If you are looking to build your collection, better to go for the Rolling Stones, Led Zep or Fleetwood Mac."
2,I don't understand.....,"...why so many people love this album so much. I am a HUGE Pink Floyd fan but this album doesn't rate as a great album, let alone a great Floyd album. I can't think of a Pink Floyd album much worse than this. Nothing really than Roger Waters wailing and whining about stupid B.S. The lyrics are very uninspiring. While there are a couple of songs on here worth listening to there just is not enough to warrant listening to this entire album. Don't let someone fool you into thinking this album is anything special."
1,I dont understand why any Pink Floyd fan could like The Wall,"The Wall is absolutly the worst Pink Floyd album ever made. I love Pink Floyd and their music but when I bought The Wall is was deeply disappointed because the Wall doesn't sound like any of the good Pink Floyd albums such as Dark Side of the Moon, Atom Heart Mother, Wish You were Here, ect. Pink FLoyd didn't use very much musical talent in this Cd and the lyrics are disappointing (the mention of a wall is endless and boring). This doesn't sound anything like the Pink FLoyd in the sixties and sevendies, they sound like a stupid eighties band that has no musical talent. ""Another Brick in the Wall"", ""Mother"", ""In the Flesh"", are just some of the songs that sound horrible and rushed. If you want to buy a good Floyd Cd check out anything but the Wall and you will be happy you did!"
5,"Don't be scared by the price, each cd is worth it's half","So many incredible pieces on this. If you don't have this, you have to get it. It's as good or better now than when they were (and still are) over-playing ""Another Brick in the Wall"". How many epic albums match the story set out in this collection of songs? How about none? If there's a limit to the excellence a band can put into a production, Pink Floyd bursts through it with ""The Wall"". Incredible guitar work and emotional lyrics; funny, sad, angry, insane, it's all here for your listening pleasure. Just calling it one of the greatest albums of all time seems like an understatement. You deserve music this good, so treat yourself while supporting a classic."
5,Amazing,"Great album, even with all of the self-indulgent lyrics. Fault me for not analyzing things enough! I just love the music on this album - ""Young Lust"" and ""The Trial"" are two of the better ones, along with the obligatory ""Comfortably Numb,"" ""Is There Anybody Out There?"" and ""Another Brick in the Wall: Part 2.""Buy it if you don't have it. You must!"
2,Not Pink Floyd!,"Unlike my husband I am not a major Floyd fan, but at the same time I do enjoy it. This CD was not what I had expected at all. I have to agree with ""A music fan from Texas"". If you are a major fan you will find this CD disappointing."
1,Pink Floyd The Wall 2000,This is was not at all what I expected. This CD does not sound anything like the orginial and I was very disappointed and so was my son whom I bought the CD for.
5,"All in all, much more than just another brick","This is one hell of an album. This is a little more Waters dominated and a bit more depressing than their previous albums, but that's the idea. This album features some of Floyd's greatest hits like ""Another Brick in the Wall part II"" ""Comfortably Numb"" and "" Run Like Hell."" It can't really be compared to any other album, because it's not like any other album, each song is like a chapter in the story being told. Although it's lacking a litle in input from the other members (it's essentially a Waters solo album) it still sounds great. Gilmours guitar riffs are as fresh as ever, Waters' lyrics are dreamy and outstanding as usual. A must have for anyone who appreciates good music."
5,An incredible masterpiece with flawless production values,"This is my favorite Pink Floyd album by far. Most people name Dark Side of the Moon as the best Pink Floyd album, but I strongly prefer this one.This album is an incredible recording of a band which is at its absolute peak in terms of musical perfection. There don't seem to be any moments in this ambitious album where the ""wrong choice"" was made in regard to a note, a choice of instrument, etc. Absolute melancholy bliss."
5,The greatest band to ever walk the planet!,"There are no words to desrcibe the genius of this record. No matter what I say about it, I still would not be doing it justice. Everyone should own and expierence this album. You can't just listen to it, it won't let you simply listen to it, you expierence the mood and the feeling of the wall. Take a TRIP through a true genius's mind and buy The Wall. And if you can handle it let me also recommend seeing the movie. The only other rock albums you can even compare the Wall too, are the other Pink Floyd albums. They are truely the greatest band EVER!"
5,Pink Floyd's and Roger Waters' Opus,"Is it even possible to comment on this Magnum Opus that capped the classic Pink Floyd lineup? The group was crumbling all around them and they would never be the same again. I believe The Wall is the most fleshed out and cohesive concept album ever conceived. My personal favorite song is Hey You. To me it sums up the album up to that point. Get this album and you're sure to find a favorite.As for the 2011 remaster? To my ears, the improvements over the previous editions are subtle. It was a well recorded and produced piece of work to begin with so improvements wouldn't be drastic. The Wall is a requirement for even the most casual Floyd fan."
1,Immersion? Really?!?!?!?,"I find it amazing that they refer to this collection as the Immersion edition of The Wall. They charge over $100 for this set and it doesn't even include the movie (just a snippet of it)! Also, the previous 2 Immersion sets (Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here) included high resolution and surround sound versions of the album. I had every intention of buying this until I found out none of that stuff would be included in this set. I know it isn't the same sound quality, but I can buy a version on iTunes (sorry Amazon it doesn't look like you have this available)that has almost everything from this box set for only $30 (including the documentary and pictures of the memorabilia in this set)! There is very little incentive to spend $120 on this incomplete ""Immersion"" set. I give the music on this 3 1/2 stars and the product itself 1 star."
3,"Wonderful album, horrible version.","Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" is my all-time favorite album. If I had to bring one CD (or a set of CDs, in this case), that's the one I'd bring.The CD issued over twenty years ago was very, very good. It sounded quite like the original LP. The insert was not bad at all. It's true that 82 minutes makes us think it could have been a single disc if they shortened something there, but no fan in his/her sane mind would want it shortened. If anything, we'd like to see a few bonus tracks instead.The 2011 remaster gave me a shock of horror. Fortunately, I still own my old CD. This new remaster is very stifled, the volume is actually a bit lower, the sound is distorted and hissing noises that not even the old LP had appeared here. The only excuse I can think of is: the original tapes must be in a pretty bad shape after thirty-odd years. Such a pity.My advice: try to look for the old version of the CD instead. The sound is much, much better in the old version."
1,This isn't right,There are a couple of bands that should never be covered. Pink Floyd is at the top of that short list. The only cover cds worth anything are the orchestra or symphony recordings that I own. There are exeptions here and there but it is just impossible for any band to do Floyd's music justice. IT JUST CAN'T be done.
3,The deal's been made....,"Whatever deal these guys put together, the source has been revealed long ago...trust me on that.Pink's odyssey began at a time in '79 when the world was a bit more uncertain yet dull, simple, thus the various intricacies that make up this opus.The members of Floyd used string arrangments, shouts, and Gilmour's free-flowing guitar style to put a stamp on British/U.S. music history; a British invasion to coincide with the livelier New Wave of British Heavy Metal stardom that washed these shores back in '78, '79.All in all an eclectic and well-worn double album to add to your stereo collection. Buy it on vinyl, for the warmth and scariness that comes through in sound is tenfold. It's a classic of ages..."
3,"A man is born, lives and dies","This is basically what ""the wall"" is about: a man has problems with his mother, his teachers, women, wonders who's to blame, is tempted by extreme solutions (drugs, fascism), is punished and in the end settles down. Could be anybody's story, more or less, and it has been told a thousand times. The only true originality of ""the wall"" is that the main character is a rock star, so it MAY give the listener some vague clues about the creative process.The music, on the other hand, is quite innovative, as a sort of mix of punk and previous Floydian contemplative/surrealistic moods. It had not been before and has not been done again since. I admit the album stretches far too long, but some compositions and Gilmour's guitar (and keyboards!) play make it worth a buying.Neither the Floyd's best album nor the worst. And a fairly good introduction to other musical and literary experiences.3/5"
2,OVERATED,"Pink Floyd and U2 are two most overated groups of all time. Floyd's most overated album is the Wall. The music is three chord schlock, the same tunes re-merge over and over again. The lyrics are completely stupid. Comfortably Numb is the only track that stands out. Great production though. Floyd had great ideas but no musical talent-something they actually have admitted)."
2,Comfortably Not Into It.,"One of the stars is for Gillmore's solo on Comfortably Numb and the other is for the song Comfortably Numb. Great Song! However, none of the other songs come close on this too long and too dark of a CD. Ok there's some OK AM radio stuff so maybe 2.5 stars. WARNING: Don't buy this until you hear it a least a couple times. It's for special musical tastes. It's not like Dark Side or Wish."
2,What were once habits now are vices.,"Roger Waters needs a life. Desperately! Yeah, this Wagnerian-style epic of how far you can crawl up your own backside was once a ""gosh-wow"" listen, I admit. Listening to it now reminds me of the downside of believing in your own purity and railing about how the callous world outside JUST DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. It's an attractive myth when you're in your twenties--if it hasn't been relegated to a nostalgic look-backwards by the time you've hit your forties, get professional help before it's too late! Given an extra star for the great sound effects"
2,"No, don't buy this.","Just check out all the other reviews. They all hate this album with a passion. And when I was reading through them I was just thinking ""Come on, it can't be that bad!"" and I checked out the samples.Okay, yeah, it is that bad.Basically what this is is a dance version of The Wall.In other words this is taking an amazing powerful concept album and turning it into a bunch of emotionless party-background tracks.My main beef with the album isn't with how the music sounds so much but with how utterly emotionless they treat the songs. It sounds just like some stereotypical dance music, like the singer was totally ignorant of the song's meanings. And I bet you, this is why so many people hate this album.So, if you're okay with the idea of turning a masterpiece into a bunch of simple run-of-the-mill electronica, then you might consider checking this one out...."
4,"more ambitious than dark side, not as perfect, but still great","the best rock opera ever (yes, better than Tommy), this complex tale weaves elements of syd barrett's life with elements from Roger Waters' past (plus of course imagination). More often than not the writing and playing is inspired. Not as tight as Dark Side' shimmering but opaque surface but more approachable and human."
5,That Space Cadet Glow...,"The Wall is truly an epic-concept-album to be remembered and passed on to generations long after we're all dead...if we manage to blow up all the human race first.This album always emotionally moves me...sometimes it makes me happy, some times it makes me cry. I was in one of those British Grammer Schools as a child, and every time I hear Happiest days of our life, and Another brick in the Wall (II) tears fill my eyes. I hated those teachers, and the Wall still makes me feel like killing some of those teachers.Some of the songs on this album have really influenced bands. I mean Vera is 100% Counting Crows material! It is not as psycedelic and trippy as some of the previous albums, so if you're looking for an Acid-Groove check out Atom Heart Mother. This album is one of Floyd's finest hour, but by far it is not the best. In fact the greatest five floydian albums are (in order):1)Dark Side of The Moon 2)Atom Heart Mother 3)The Wall 4)Wish You where here 5)Meddle"
3,School's Out,"Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" attempts to do with a double album what Alice Cooper's ""School's Out"" did with a 3 minute single--not to mention Supertramp's ""Crime of the Century"" with a single album. ""The Wall"" has it's moments--actually, some great moments--but there's a lot of fluff in between. This could have been tightened up into one great single album, or at least a double album short enough to fit on a single CD!"
5,The Wall Makes Pink Floyd Gods Among Men,"I had always passed Pink Floyd off as just a stoner band. Because all the stoners at my school wear Dark Side of the Moon shirts. Well, now I am kicking my self for holding back on trying them out. A few months ago my math teacher was playing The Wall in class(no, you didn't read that wrong). I was absolutly gobsmacked at how wonderful it was. This is what music can and should be, taking you into a world, even if its our own, with full and complex textures that just grab you and won't let you go. I was further blown away that there are a handle full of people who didn't like it. You can't please everyone but we can leave them to their N-Sync."
5,WAY UNDER PRICED!,"This is the greatest album ever made. If you listen to the music carefully, youll pick up all kinds of sounds and meanings..... itll make you lose track of time.... itll make you bass out....itll put you to sleep, no matter what youre feeling like. Between the wall and dark side of the moon, youll never need another cd. My favorite song on the whole thing is the Trial. That song will make ya think twice....Good morning, Worm your Honor!"
5,Simply great,"I remember sitting in a park somewhere in London. An old man came up to me and said ""don't be a fool son, put the banana back in the bag"". Without thinking I began to do just that when sudenly I remembered an experience from 15 years ago. Half a bottle of cheap vodka and a packet of garlic bread consumed I lurched in to my bedroom, stood in front of my stereo, paused a second then smeared a banana into my hair. Made a hell of a mess, got a new girlfriend the following day though!So old man, the next time that you want to go interferring with blokes in the great parks of London, 'we don't need no education'.Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' made a hell of a mess of my hair and introduced a musical experience that has yet to be surpassed by artists since. 'Waiting for the worms', whilst not one of their better known tracks, fills the room with sounds and shapes that cannot be described. A bucket of milk, bag of ice cream and sixty tabs and I'm in heaven. (bit pricey though!)"
4,The Needful Things soundtrack is an enjoyable listen for all,"If youve ever seen the movie Needful Things, you found yourself wanting more from certain areas, such as the plot, which was butchered by Castle Rock Entertainment. However, the movie still was a devlishly good time, thanks in large part to the score and themes in the movie. The opening credits are sweeping and marvelous, thanks in part to the music. The theme to Needful Things is a very enticing piece which holds throughout. It has been used in recent trailers, such as Denzel Washingtons ""Fallen"". In addition, Grieg's ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" and Schubert's ""Ave Maria"" are always a pleasure to listen to and bring back images from two memorable scenes from the movie. Needful Things is a great soundtrack, with haunting melodies and powerful orchestras, a keeper for the classical music and movie score lover."
3,Promising Debut CD By Sarah Lee Guthrie,"Sarah Lee Guthrie's debut CD showcases her authentic folk voice on uneven material. This CD is a great piece of information for fans who already have ""Exploration,"" her more focused collaboration with husband Johnny Irion."
5,Jamie Foxx - Unpredictable,"Great 2nd Album from Jamie Foxx and is definetly 1 of the better Hip-Hop releases in recent times, the album also provides listeners with some nice slower jams that Mr. Foxx perfects well. The whole disc is really a great listen, with the first half of the disc being more Hip-Hop and the 2nd being more on the R&B; side of things, which i believe Foxx is best at :).A few collaborations with artists like Mary J Blige, Kanye West, Snoop Dogg and others also give a nice touch to the album.My Favourite Tracks include : ""Unpredictable"" ""Can I Take U Home"" ""Do What It Do"" ""Storm (Forcass)"" and ""VIP"". The 2 Must listen to tracks are ""Heaven"" and ""Wish U Were Here"" which top off the album great and will leave you wanting more!"
4,Surprising,"Jamie Foxx is very hot, I really enjoyed the artists he choose to work with. I think he is finally on his way."
3,A Bit Young For Mr. Foxx,"Even though I like the album, I was dissapointed by the content. I found the songs to be immature for Jamie. The album doesn't show off his piano bar soft side, neither his gospel background that I believe most of us have fallen in love with.If it wasn't Jamie Foxx, the album would be just another average one the public would overlook.I still love you though, Jamie..."
2,Leave The Sex Out,"I liked about three cuts on this cd. But, that was only because of all of the references to sex. Jamie needs to stay with songs that accentuate his voice style. I don't understand why he had to make just about all of the cd about sex, then to add the songs about his daughter and his grandmother to this cd was wrong. If he wanted to make a cd for the younger crowd and a cd for the older crowd, that would have made a lot more sense."
2,Lacks originality,"There's no doubt about the gift this man has but I don't feel this is the best effort he could've put forward. Im dissapointed in the fact that he blends in to the mainstream. The sex symbol thing is ok if that's what he wants to be known for however, in my opinion he's trying either too hard to be someone or something he's not."
3,Vary your subject matter a lil honey!,"Jamie, I love your voice. You do have talent, you can sing and all. But seriously babe, you need to vary your subject matter some. The songs are nice and one of my favorites is ""Love Changes"" with Mary J. But I wish you could have changed up a little bit in your subject matter and not talked about sex, sex, sex in almost ALL of your songs. Other than that, I have no other complaints about this cd."
2,Could Have Done Much Better!!!,"I broke my neck attempting to purchase this CD for family and friends on Christmas Eve 2005. I should have bought everyone Mary Js new CD instead.Jamie Foxx has proven that he has a very beautiful singing voice. I felt this way from a long time ago (Peep This, In Living Color etc..) This album had too many Hip Hop collabos- the cursing wasnt needed or creative.I thought it was going to be more smoothed out ""Grown Folks Music"" Unfortunately it wasnt. It seems the powers that be wanted this album to appeal to the 30 and under crowd- too bad. I am not interested in the whole sex sex sex bling bling get drunk high R and B that radio trys to push on us .I wished Jamie had challenged himself vocally and lyrically"
5,One of my current favorites!,"This CD is so vesatile. It has something on it for everyone. Jamie covers a lot of areas. Thug, sex, romance, tributes. Just be careful where you are when you sing them. There is not a song on this CD that I do not like. I'm older and still can't get use to graphic language and profanity in public. So I blast his CD at home. It's whimsical, Jamie can sing. The cd is ""catchy"". Wonder how many 40+ unknowingly find themselves singing ""DJ..."" and ""3 letter Word""? Buy this CD."
3,Good Start,"Well, I've been a fan of Jamie Foxx since In Livin' Color and love all of his acts! I always thought he should release a cd and this day finally came!! I listened to the preview with a local DJ in Atlanta and fell in love with it and counted down the days to buy it!! I now have it and love tracks 1, 4, 7, 14 and another one I can't recall. So, overall it's a good start. I would have like to hear more upbeat songs vs. the slow jams but I give him 3.5 stars!!"
2,ms. Libra,"Jamie Foxx needs to stick to acting because he is a far better actor than singer. i was very disappointed in his latest try at making another cd. give it up Jamie, and stick to being funny."
5,"EXCELLENT, PURE MAGIC, JAMIE FOXX HAS HIT THE BULLSEYE","Every track on that album is PURE MAGIC, Jamie Foxx shows his class and has raised the bar in terms of singing.This is REAL soul music.Forget about Usher and Beyonce CRAP, this album is the REAL DEAL."
1,Another Cash In,"This cd is pure dreck and it's just another example of the ""flavor of the month"" actor/wanna be singer trying to cash in on his current notoriety. Geared toward the ghetto illiterates with the dirty raps,language and moronic lyrics. Just goes to show what passes for entertainment these days. I wish all these half wits that are praising this piece of crap would learn how to spell first. You have no business posting a review on here. Go back to school or stay in the projects! No stars for the cd at all."
2,Not the Jamie I was hoping for,"Jamie Foxx has one of the smoothest voices out there. I've always thought that. I was also hoping that he would put out another album. But now that he has it out, I regret making that statement. This album is not good at all. There are maybe one or two nice songs on the album but otherwise, it's not something that I would add to my collection. I'm glad my sister bought this album and not me. It's all for her. She seems to enjoy it a lot."
1,A wasted talent,"Hey Jamie! I hope this is one review that you take to heart. I was excited about you singing again. I believe you have a beautiful voice. I was hoping you would have come with some music that would change the music industry not just fit in. I call this wasted talent because you are so gifted but you are using your gifts to futher promote music that does not add to the betterment of people. There are more things in life than money, power, and sex.Disappointed fan! Cole"
2,"""...disappointing...""","A marvellous actor; an incredible voice - but why is it that his album is one of the most unoriginal and dull experiences that so many of us are fed up of hearing? ""Unpredictable"" is a disappointing album that will probably be a success amongst those faint-hearted fans of the cheesy, cliché love-songs that have come to make me feel nauseous. All I can say is, Jamie, I know you can do better!"
3,Jamie Foxx Cd,I only enjoyed a couple of songs on the Cd. I thank God for his efforts to make a cd because he has a very nice voice. I believe the next one will be much better.
1,Big disappointment,"My daughter won this CD from a local hip-hop station. After seeing Jamie Foxx in ""Ray,"" and reading articles about his musical education and upbringing, I thought it would be okay for her have his CD. When we picked it up, I was surprised to find that Jamie Foxx, a parent himself, would release an album that requires a parental advisory warning. If it hadn't been free, I wouldn't have allowed her to have it, and have since confiscated it because of the sexual content. I am disappointed in Jamie Foxx. I expected better from him."
1,Absolute GARBAGE!!!,"If I could give this CD ""0"" stars I would have. 1-star is way too much. When I saw that Jamie Foxx had a new CD out I was shocked because I hadn't heard any promotions of it. After wasting my money on this CD, I can see why. I must admit that Jamie, due to the Oscar winning, is become overexposed and without question OVERRATED. This CD is horrible. Now I am a very liberal person but this CD goes too far. I agree with an early reviewer who said that it sounds as if it only took Jamie 5 minutes to write the lyrics. I think Jamie has started to believe the hype about himself. I have 3 words for you---SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Jamie, all I can say is you need to come back down to earth my brother. You are out there!"
1,Sounds like it took 15 minutes to write these tracks,"It always amazes me how anyone can be drawn to tracks that clearly sound like there was hardly any thought in the arrangements. Ya'll have to check out Jamiroquai and his new album dynamite. Now here's an example of music that first off was an asswoop to create/arrange/write. You'll be blown away. Its classified as acid Jazz, and it is definitely the top 5 albums of the year."
5,I love it,"I feel that this was a well put together album, being that he is coming out now with it will make it a hit. But he could have done a few more ballads and not as many Rap collaboes's but over all I like it, it shows that he is very versatile, we were all expecting it to be a CD with all ballads and he changed it up Good job Jamie you will always be successful in my book."
1,Jamie Foxx - Unpredictable,HATED IT!!! I should have read reviews first. Not at all what I expected. He has a wonderful voice but it was NOT showcased at all. Lyrics are VERY explicit! I could never listen with my young kids in the house...but the CD will not be around here long enough for anyone to hear. I don't care that he thinks about sex every minute or how much he drank or where he ended up! What a voice!!! too bad he wasted it on crappy lyrics. Maybe he should stick to acting. Reminds me of the trainwreck Madonna made with her sex book several years back! Who cares how much sex Foxx is having give me some good music!
2,Dissappointing,"I usually read a bit about a CD before I buy it but in this case I just went out and bought the CD before reading reviews. I think Jamie Foxx is an incredibly talented man on many levels. I know he has an extensive musical background so I thought I was safe spending my money on his CD. What a dissappointment the CD turned out to be and a waste of money. He can sing and play but beyond that the CD falls short. Lyrically the songs never rise above the ""damn woman, I know what you want and I'm the only one who can give it to you like you want"" vein. With the wealth of talent that appears on the CD you would expect some originality and inovation....it's just not there."
4,Do what it do,"Okay so if you'll read my reviews then you'll know that I'm really feeling Jamie Foxx as of late and yes, I've seriously been singing his praises. UNPREDICTABLE was heavily sought out in the streets of Chicago; want to know how I know? I was all over the place looking to purchase it.Jamie Foxx is stepping up his game! No longer just a comedian with the ability to make you laugh, or an actor who can open your eyes, but he's proven that he has the ability to sing. I don't mean that mess where it's a ton of voice over work either, Jamie is a gifted artist who makes listening to his CD a pleasure.Unpredictable is actually one of those CD's that you can play when you need to mellow out while riding through the busy streets and not lose your cool. Because ya'll know I suffer from road rage, right?I LOVE each song, the beats, the collaborations and it's good to hear quality music coming back to R&B;."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"Not many actors can make the transition to singing as smoothly as Jamie Foxx has. This is probably because upon starting his career, Jamie Foxx had planned on going into the music business. When that didn't work out as planned, stand up and acting became a way to keep the bills paid while continuing to pursue his dream.This album is sexy without being crass. It features a line up of collaborations with Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, Common, Mary J. Blige and others. The song U still Got It featuring Common is a nice change from the standard I hate my baby momma she ain't nothing but a pain in the behind songs that have inundated the airways lately. The song Heaven that was written for his daughter is also a favorite. Very good for a sophomore album."
3,"Great production and voice, but the lyrics need work","Jamie Foxx has a good voice and he vocally leaps and soars on the album with ease. The first aborted single, ""Extravaganza"" however illustrates what hurts Jamie the most: his awkward lyrics. Ended up at the embassy? It seems like at times Jamie cares less about crafting a song and more about just finding a word that rhymes so he can move on with the song.The other problem is that Jamie seems to be stuck on one theme: sex. R&B; and sex are the proverbial peanut butter and jelly, but listening to the album you can't help but feel like Jamie's overdoing it just a little bit.""Can I Take You Home"" though is a wonderful throwback to early 90s R&B; and even has Timbaland revisiting his old school sound from his early days producing Aaliyah's ""One In A Million"" album."
4,Jamie is nasty!,"J Foxx aka Eric Bishop is nasty and hot. This CD is not better(to me)then his first effort, Peep This, however, dude still can sing, and that's what is important, he is going to give these cats out here a run for their money. Look out R. Kelly."
4,Extremely Talented,"Make no mistake...this is for real. For those who slept on his 1995 debut ""Peep This"", you need to look no further than this album for proof that Eric Bishop, as funny as he is, from Terrell, TX is no joke! His debut on J Records is a fantastic effort that brings back the mid 90's sexed-up R&B feel first brought to the forefront by groups such as Jodeci, R.Kelly & Public Announcement and Silk...Jamie is in full control and displays all his swagger and a great voice throughout the album. He is also backed by very dope, sexy production that he floats effortlessly over. Vocal production and songwriting is above average as well (Tank, Mike City, etc). If you're looking for a dope album to throw on, bump front to back, ride to or grind to with your significant other...I suggest you cop ""Unpredictable"" immediately!!! VERY DOPE ALBUM!"
3,Good to listen to at the store........,"and leave the cd at the store and listen to Charlie Wilson on the way home. You will forget about Jamie Foxx as soon as the first song starts. Do not buy this cd, just listen to it in a friends car....not worth spending more than 5 bucks on."
4,"GREAT CD - FUN, VIVACIOUS, AND SEXY",Jamie has proved himself as a creative and respectable musical artist. This CD is full of uptempo party songs. Jamie has such a wonderful voice. I wish he would have included more ballads to really showcase his vocal range.
5,HOW CAN ONE PERSON BE SO TALENTED?,"Eric Bishop, aka Jamie Foxx, has to be the most versatile entertainer in history. Funny (check), Great actor (check), money (check), talented musician (check), Great voice (check). I read the negative reviews and I crack up. If I had even one fifth the talent that Jamie Foxx has...Unpredictable is a very entertaining CD from a great artist. For the 30 something crowd its easy to root for him because we basically grew up with him. I've been a Jamie Foxx fan ever since in living color which seems like a million years ago now. He's come a long ways and he takes his artistry very serious. Very refreshing. Keep up the good work."
2,Turned Off,"Jamie Foxx can undoubtedly hold a note. Unfortunately, he doesn't have his own sound or definitive style. At times it seems as if someone else is singing. As I listened, I also wondered who the audience might be for this album with the extremes of sincere ballads which seemed in sharp contrast to raunchy, blatantly sexual lyrics.The only songs I listen to on the CD are:1. Unpredictable5. Can I Take U Home13. U Still Got It (love Common)14. Heaven15. Wish U Were HereBy the way, he and Mary J. Blige destroyed Love Changes. When is somebody going to take away Mary J. Blige's microphone? The chick cannot sing.I found Jamie Foxx more sexy before he made the CD. Now I am just TURNED OFF!"
3,Unpredictable is anything but,"Mr. Bishop (aka Jamie) talks about sex too much. And he and Mary J. Blige should have left ""Love Changes"" alone; Kashif and Meli'sa Morgan did a better cover of it back in the day. This album is good for getting the mood right with your mate but this ain't no ""must-buy"" type of album. Since Jamie's reaching 40 years old, I thought he would come at us on a ""grown folks music"" type thing but he sounds like another Ginuwine or R. Kelly. He does save the best for last, however, with ""Heaven"" and ""Wish U Were Here""."
1,Let down.,"I was really looking forward to hearing this album... and when I bought it and put in it my car to listen on the drive home, I couldn't have been more disappointed. Every song is strangely and immaturely sexual... and his talent is taken over with sexual innuedo and pathetic stereotypical subject matter, lyrics, beats etc...DO NOT waste your money on this one.His talent is wasted."
2,I Wanna Be Impressed!!!,"Just bought the CD and was not really moved by what I heard ....UNTIL I got to ""Wish You Were Here"". That song says everthing about what you can feel about a loved one that is no longer here on earth. Otherwise, the CD (and his recent TV Special for that matter) is extremely 'average' to me.I know he is a talented actor and he has recorded in the past (with Gladys Knight) but based on the track mentioned above and ""Three Letter Word"", I am not happy with this project. There is way too much cussin' (yes, I said CUSSIN') (lol) and sexual messages here for me. I will probably give it away!!Maybe next time :("
3,Jamie is the music artist that brings it down,"I always like Jamie since he stared acting in moives now his album Unperdictable is more than ever ""DJ play a love song"" is one of my favorites but Mr. Eric Bisop a.k.a Jamie Foxx I gave is 3 stars becuase this album, it needs more gorwn and sexy into it."
2,Hated It !!,"Yep, I ran out and got it the first day !! Was expecting Jamie to ""tickle the ivories"" a little more, but this is just a re-hashing of every hip-hop artist's works from the past 5 or so years. You'll sell a few Jamie, because you're ""gettin' while the gettin's good"", but please don't let that classical training go to waste next time, IF there is a next time."
5,Beyond Expectations.....,"Jamie did a GREAT job with his album...My parents used to tell me about the music they listened to that created me. The music that put them in the ""mood""...You know the Marvin Gaye's and Barry White's.True Classics...Well Jamie's album is one that I will be creating my first child to (newly married). It was simply amazing. I could honestly allow the cd to play through until the ""Love Changes with Mary J.B"" I had to change it because I dont care for Mary. Other then that Jamie did an amazing job...GO J.!"
4,Unpredictably....Good!,"I read thru all the reviews before submitting my opinion. Overall I think the album is decent. I love Jamie as a singer and actor. The cd insert picture reminded me too much of the ""Redemption"" portrayal. So at first listen it was hard to see Jamie as an artist. But on second listen I closed my eyes and listened with an open mind and I really like the cd. I'm glad I added this one to my cd collection.My favorites include:1-""Heaven""2-""Love Changes""3-""Storm""4-""Wish U Were Here"""
5,captivating,jamie foxx CD is a nice CD too just chill off of. and if you don't like jamie foxx you will. Its unpredictable.
2,This cd is PREDICTABLE!,"It is a typical no-talent, hip-hop, sampled cd that has become common today. I love Jamie Foxx, and was really believing that he would put out a fabulous album; but someone in his entourage should tell him that his fan-base is much larger than the groupies that he takes home with him every night. This entire album is an ""ode to a one night stand"" and partying in the VIP. With a voice like his and the musical training he has, I was expecting ballads and songs to make my imagination run wild. Instead I received his diary of meeting women on the dance floor to take to the Embassey, and his description of taking them to the VIP to perform acts on him to ""get that money."" The album is full of machine beats...what happened to the piano Jamie?! Its a great album for the young club hoppers; but for the mature audience....GIVE ME A BREAK! I thought Jamie was much bigger than that. He may as well be a rapper, because he definately isn't using his talent on this one."
3,Not what I expected!,"I love Jamie Fox and I think he is a wonderful actor so I didn't hesitate and purchased his CD. Sorry to say but it was very predictable, except for his debut single, ""Unpredictable,"" the other songs were just a repeat of the same theme. Getting the Girl!! I'm all for supporting ""our"" people but if you have to get the CD, get the bootleg on this one."
3,Sexy lyrics hide true talent,"There's nothing wrong with a little bump and grind...but Jamie has more than a little. With an amazing talent such as a Mr. Foxx, I found myself searching for the voice I have come to enjoy in a sea of sex filled lyrics. Overall I did enjoy the CD. In fact, I found tears in my eye while listening to ""I wish you were here"". I know that sex sells CD's (say that 3 times fast) However, in this case, I know the brillance of the artist coupled with his (as Mr. West put it) ""star power"" would have made for a greater offering. -K. Palmer"
4,Love it and Jamie too!!!,"I gave it a four because it does take a few listens for all of the tracks to grow on you and I wished there had been one or two more upbeat ones. However, this is a very good CD (vocals, tracks, etc.). Jamie has a wealth of talent and since he can really sing, he can sound different on different songs. Someone barely able to hold a note (aka studio singers) struggles to sound the one way they do and usually won't sing live. I heard Jamie on Oprah and he sounded great. He also did a wonderful mini concert on his ""I might need security"" DVD. After listening to Mary's latest, I was even more impressed with ""Unpredictable"". I'm soooooo glad I purchased Jamie and just borrowed Mary. It's explicit and all ""R&B"", so if you're a recent bandwagon fan, this may not be the CD for you."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!,"THIS WILL DEFINITELY BE ON PERMANENT ROTATION IN MY CAR, HOUSE, WORK, ETC. YOU GET THE PICTURE. I guess the people who are surprised or act like they just found out Jamie Foxx could sing haven't been fans for very long. He's always sang in his comedy acts and on his show. Wonderful voice, wonderful actor! ENOUGH SAID!"
5,Jamie Foxx is 4 real!,"I purchased this CD on its release date. I was very happy with the album. Jamie Foxx spent time with the lyric's and beats and you would know as you listen to it. I believe it's one of the greatest album's I've purchased this year. He adds Mary J Blige, Twista, and Snoop Dogg and Tha Game, and Ludacris which makes it interesting. A GREAT cd overall!"
4,Better than expected...,"I saw Jamie perform ""Unpredictable"" on Oprah, and was floored! You get so used to Jamie crackin' jokes and actin' a fool, and then he goes and get SEXY on you!!! He delivered with so little effort that I had to look closely at his lips to make sure he wasn't lip synching (HE WASN'T!!). I received the cd for Christmas, and a day hasn't gone by that I haven't played the cd..TWICE! The lyrics aren't the greatest (kinda R. Kelly-ish), but I would definitely say it wouldn't be a waste of money. Jamie is definitely a triple threat these days!"
4,This CD is a hit banger!!,"This cd is very impressive. At first I only bought for ""unpredictable"" but I decided to listen to the rest of the songs and was blown away. If you love R&B; and the development of the music and the chords and harmonies you will love thisCD. Be warned that this CD was made for adults but once you get past the explict lyrics you'll hear some real good R&B.; Loved it and still loving it!"
4,Jamie may just give Will Smith a run for his money!,"This album just oozes soul and sex appeal. I think Ludacris made a great appearance on ""Unpredictable"". And I absolutely love ""U still got it"". Its about a man telling his pregnant wife to stop worrying about her weight cuz he's still crazy over her no matter what. (awwww...)There's still some tracks which ticks me off though, but under than that I'm loving this album. You go Jamie!"
4,"Enjoyable, but Predictable","This album is pretty enjoyable. It's got some single worthy tracks on it. However, basically every track except like 2 are about sex. Sex is great, but I would have liked to have seen a little more depth in Jamie. Overall, I still give it 4 stars because the hooks are catchy, and its got great production."
4,impressive,I was doubtful to purchase this album but have no regrets now after hearing it. Jamie has a clean flow & the guest artists add alot. I'm feeling it!
2,Predictable,Foxx should stick to acting or have someone else write his songs because the lyrical content is lacking...seems like he tried but failed to remake R Kelly's success through sex-talk formula.
1,He Has an Album Out??,So THIS is why he was cheerleading for Stanley Cookie Williams last week before he got terminated. It all makes sense now.....
2,I've thought long and hard about this,"It hurts me to say this because I am one of his biggest fans, but this cd was not what I expected or predicted that it would be. It has some nice songs, ""You Still Got It"", ""Heaven"", and ""I Wish You Were Here"" but the rest of the songs I could have done without. It seems like this cd was all about the profit with him and it bothers me that he has stooped so low because he has so much talent and such a beautiful voice. Jamie, if you gonna do it, do it right puhleeeaasse!!!"
1,The Song: Love Changes,"I can not speak for the entire album, the first and only song I heard on this was Love Changes Featuring Mary J and it was completely terrible and I totally love Mary J but she sounded like she had been drinking a lot or something and Jamie I mean really he should stick with acting! Their voices didn't even mesh together, they sounded like kackling chickens, she's doing one thing and he's doing another. I don't think I even want to hear any thing else on this album. If that song is any indication of what the whole album is like then I certainly don't want to hear it."
1,Crap,I expected something more serious from Jaime Foxx. This CD is a waste of my time and a waste of his talent.
2,no no no,"This does not work for me.I am a fan of Foxx the actor, but is music is not goodI expected a lot more"
2,Early 90's R&B throwback,I love Jaime Foxx but found myself very dissapointed by this album. The whole album is like a throwback to early 90's R&B. SO much of the material is silly sex songs leaving the listener hungry for more depth and substance in the music. I wish I didn't buy this album and my pockets could be $15 dollars heavier. On the other hand Mary J's new album and Anthony Hamilton's were both well worth my investments and I give those both 4 to 5 stars.
3,I'm surprised,"I thought that considering his image right now and how he's representing, I would have never imagined that he would come out with a cd that has such crass and immature lyrics.Jamie, I'm very disappointed. I just knew that you were going to come out ""Grown and Sexy."" I liked the first one better."
1,surely unpredictable,Just because a person can sing does not make him a artist. I will not dispute that Jamie has an amazing voice....BUT he is not an future r and b artist. This cd is garbage. Simple lyrics with a lot of I mean too many collaborations....Maybe about 3 tracks get my head nodding. I need substance and this CD doesn't have that....
3,So Disappointed,"I have to agree with the person who stated that Jamie's fan base is much larger than the young hip hop groupies. Most people who have followed Jamie Foxx's career are older than 21. I was so hyped about getting this cd. I even pre-order and pre-paid for it. I was hoping for a continuation of Peep This (which I still listen to). This was not it!Jamie Foxx has tremendous talent, however, his vocals on this cd are often overshadowed by the needless profanity and the constant bantering about sex. Eric Bishop must be performing Heaven because everything else sounds like other people, including Wish U Were Here which sounds like R. Kelly. I want Eric Bishop to record a cd so I can hear him SAAAANG instead of entertaining. The songs he did on The Jamie Foxx show sound better than some of the tracks on this cd.Food for thought: Grown and sexy women don't want to hear someone cussing them out when they are a romantic mood. Whispering works better :) LOL."
3,Not entirely pleased,"I received the item more than 2 weeks after it was ordered and paid for. Once I received it, I opened the package and the CD case was completely broken. Not pleased at all."
1,very predictable,without even knowing the songs you know the words.this should be a hit with the youngsters who dont know better.
2,Waste of talent,"I was very disappointed with Jamie Foxx on this Cd. His first cd was way better than this and he wasnt even really known then. There was too much hype about this CD and it wasn't lived up to when you listen to it. Maybe he should've gotten better producers to help him because this isn't cutting it. The songs are very poorly written and he isn't showing his true talent. I say him on the Ellen Degenress show and he told her that bascially he rushed this cd because everyone was pressing him since he did Kanye West ""Golddigger"" and this was a perfect time for him to get his music off the ground. I love Jamie Foxx as a actor, he is wonderful, but as a singer he just didn't do it for me on ""Unpredictable"". Like me alot of people went out and copped it because last year was his year and he had alot of success with ""Ray"" and ""Golddigger"""
4,"SEXY, GROWN-UP AND UNPREDICT","JAMIE REALLY CAN SING! PUTS SEXY R & B BACK ON THE CHARTS! REMINDS ME OF A MIX OF OLD SCHOOL AND NEW SCHOOL FROM A BLACK MAN'S PERSPECTIVE. JAMIE SETS THE MOOD FOR A NIGHT FULL OF THE UNPREDICTABLE BTW A MAN AND WOMAN!...WARM BED!!! STRICTLY ADULT, GROWN UP LISTENING! GOOD FOR ROAD TRIP WITH MATE WHO HAS CHEMISTRY AND SEX APPEAL. IT WILL SPEAK FOR YOU! LOVE MARY J BLIGE AND LUDICRAS TRACS!!""PEACHES FROM THE SOUTH"""
4,WWE in Australia for the 1st time in 20 years,"56, 000 + witnessed this show, held at Melbourne's Colonial Stadium on August 10 this year. I was one of those in attendance for the WWE's first show down under for nearly 20 years, and I can say that it was an exciting, if a little bit predictable, night of wrestling. There were some good matches on the card, specifically the Cruiserweight title match between the Hurricane and Jamie Noble, the Tag Title match with Rey Mysterio and Kidman taking on Lance Storm and Christian of the Un-Americans, Kurt Angle (playing the face, funnily enough) against Test, Chris Jericho vs. fellow Canadian Edge and the main event with the Undisputed Title on the line, which saw The Rock defend against Brock Lesnar and Triple H in an exciting match. I am led to believe there will be extras on the DVD, with footage of the WWE superstars touring throughout Melbourne. Don't watch it for the best card of wrestling but it will still be an enjoyable viewing."

4,UFO Set 2,UFO Set 2 is as good as set 1. I realy liked the UFO tv series. I think it was a good tv series. When it left the air I was unhappy because I liked the series very much. Now I own both dvd sets and I watch them a lot. I am glad that the series is out on dvd.
3,North's Previous and Subsequent Works Were Better,"As much as I admire the work of composer North, I find this to be a disappointment. Kubrick used his best judgment in ""jettisoning"" North's contribution to the sci-fi opus. While North was gifted in jazz-inspired scoring (a magnificent one for ""A Streetcar Named Desire""), epics (both ""Spartacus"" and ""Cleopatra,"" two of the best of the genre) and fantasy (""Dragonslayer,"" an underrated score from an underrated film), his attempt at providing the music for a film as monumental as ""2001"" just didn't make it. It was just too lackluster to accompany the highly dramatic and enigmatic cinematic visions of Kubrick."
1,What a terrible score?,I can't believe people prefer this score to the classical score in the film! The Alex North score is unoriginal and just like every other film music of the time. This score doesn't do the visuals justice and it would dramatically date the film. If they would have kept this in the film it would have been just lke all those cheesy sci-fi films that were made before 2001. In terms of the score itself it's not the worst score I've heard but it just doesn't accomplish what Kubrick had in mind.
5,WOW- I loved this cd,"if you are been Boney.M fan. this is pack for us. Mostly songs is full leght version , not edited version. And with bonus cd with 12""long version its was not realeased before...i loved this cd very much"
5,OUTSTANDING MINISTRY,"I am glad to see that Karen remains true to her call no matter what her style of music or who the producers are. This is another wonderful project by her!!!! She commands the presence of God and I must say that there is not one element missing on this project, not one. Keep putting God in the fore-front Ms Sheard. A MUST HAVE..."
1,Don't waste your money,It's over for me. This CD was not Karen's best by a long shot.She needs to spend more time finding better material and less time on hair and makeup..
4,GOOD CD.,"I really like Karen Clark Sheard and this album was really nice but is does not compare to The Heavens Are Telling.....but this album was nice and it has a few good songs. A few of my fav. tracks on this album are I Will Never, Favor, Show Me Your Glory, Oh the Glory his Presence, The Lord's Prayer, Hallelujah, Be Blessed, A Living Testimony."
4,She's Back,"Karen's no Dorinda but she's back on the market in my book. These last couple of cd's were not her. She was trying to cross over and it was not working. This cd i love cause you can really worship and feel God's presence in these songs. Karen, stay true to Gods word and dont settle because everyone else is."
3,~Its Not Over Is The Best Track But You Still Got To Come Back~,"Karens CD is good but as well as some of the others its still not like the first Cd ""Finally Karen"" and i do feel like the anoiting is not as powerful as she use to be, it seems more for show then it is for the anoiting. Now ""It's Not Over"" the titel track was off the Chain, it sounded like her and every thing, all the other tracks just sound like Israel, and when I buy Isreal I want to Hear Isreal but when i buy Karen I want to hear karen.And Karen im still going to support your music,just Make sure you get around good ANOITED People that are about Worship And KNOCK THE BOOTS OFF THE DEVILS FEET (lol)P.S. Go back with Donald Lawrence I like him Better for Your Music"
2,It's Ok,"Karen Clark new cd its not over, there is only two songs that I like on there. The main song I really like is He Never Will. That song really makes me feel happy, I get happy when I listen to that song. I am a great fan of the Clark Sisters. I am a gospel recording artist myself, but I haven't came out yet. But God has told me that I was going to be out there! Then I am hoping to sing with them on my CD when the Lord brings me out. So look for me, My name is Marie Bell Nero. Look for me I will be out soon! God Bless You!"
5,An annointed family,"I just love all of the musical blessings of the Clark Moss Family. They are truly annointed musically to spread the Gospel through song. I love Karen Clark-Sheard for her willingness to truly allow the annointing to stay within her music. I love the song that her son produced the last song on the CD. WOW the gifts that God has bestowed on this family will continue forever. Also PJAM and Israel produced the other tracks, I really enjoy the new style of many of the songs on this CD. I really would like to see JMoss and Karen complete a Duet together, their riffs are similar. I LOVE Gospel and I love this CD."
4,Commendable Wrestling with the Most Difficult Ancient Document,"I just finished two commendable publications on Revelation, having read them back-to-back. They were quite a contrast. N. T. Wright is a staunch disciple of Jesus Christ and an excellent researcher as well as writer. He knows his subject, is committed to the Truth, and seeks to reach his audience."
1,waste of time and money,"I thought this book sound so very interesting, being a major foodie. NOT. This book was more of a travel guide. She was supposed to go to cafeterias across the country so I thought she would discuss the food. NOT. She spent more time on facts about the school, the town, the state and the student who invited her. She seldom mentioned what she ate at each school and/or what she thought of it.She also told way too many stupid silly jokes at the expense of her own cooking. Ok, a few would have been OK..but she had way too many and most were LAME.I dont know who authorized this book to even be published. The title of the book seriously misrepresents what the book is about. I am pissed to have wasted money and money on this."
2,Kylie Is Better Than This DVD,"Coming near the end of a two year whirlwind of recording and touring, it is no surprise Kylie does not have much energy left. This DVD shows that. If you own her CDs, there is no need to spend more money on this.If you want a SHOW, get the DVD 'Live In Sidney(On a Night Like This)'. Kylie has energy in Sydney.Kylie is a world class performer and singer. This DVD is OK, but does not show her at her best."
5,Amazing music,"I heard Justice once in a friend's car and loved their unique sound immediately. I bought the album knowing nothing about the rest of the music, but it is simply amazing."
4,Very good.,"This album is very good with that French electro sound. If you like Daft Punk and parties, you might like this album. The opening notes say it all.Great (not just good) tracks:PhantomGenesisDVNOStressOne Minute to MidnightThe rest of the tracks are all good, except 'The Party'. This track (featuring Uffie) is terrible because she has no talent and basically sing-talks over a quiet Justice track. Either a) the Justice guys mistakenly convinced themselves she's good or b) there was pressure from the record label to put her on a track (Uffie and Justice are both on Ed Banger records)."
3,Short lived good time,"Although clearly going for the title next Daft Punk by exerting a highly refined, expertly produced signature sound of glowing keyboards and pulsing beats, this disc, especially in the latter half, falls short of lofty ambitions and becomes a clear-cut party disc without the benefit of it being much past that."
4,"My review won't do it ""justice"".","Notice half the reviews here make the Daft Punk comparison. It's hard not to. The dance/pop/electronica sound will fill your room, and put a smile on your face. Reminds me a bit of Basement Jaxx also. When this album is on, you have to work at remaining still. The urge to move is hard to avoid. Even right now as I listen, both my feet and shoulders and neck are moving, and I'm sitting. Instant party? Yes.Funny what you find at a thrift store for 99 cents in small town Vermont."
4,It's a copy of Basillios - but then again... it rules.,Cet album gouverne. C'est dommage la division de Basillios d'eux juste avant le relchement de cet album. Bien que Basillios > l'album est solide... il n'a pas juste le mme succès commercial comme la Justice. Il semble comme il sera le Dave Mustaine de musique électronique.Bon Album.
3,Mediocre as mediocre gets...,"When I'm judging an album, if I'm not initally impressed, I figure on 10 total plays to make a decision. After 10 plays, ""Cross"" still didn't have me feeling one way or another. After 15 more plays, this album still shows the same - good then bad.Once things start sounding good, as in the opening track ""Genesis"", they quickly turn to bad, in ""Let There Be Light"" (This track gives me a headache). ""D.A.N.C.E"" and ""Newjack"" are cute and the album kind of wanders through ""TTHHEE PPAARRTTYY"" and ""DVNO"" with nothing overly impressive. ""Waters of Nazareth"" is a nice track that should have been more towards the beginning of the album and then the album kind of just goes away, wanting me to play it again, and I don't know why.Overall, not terrible, but not something I'm going to be playing months from now."
3,I am a little dissipoited,When I first saw the D.A.N.C.E. music video on DailyMotion I couldn't wait to get my hands on this album. The song just made me want to get up and dance. As soon as I got the disk I started listening to it on my good headphones as to not loose any of the quality but immediately was bothered by the over production of this album. Distortion got in the way of the clean beats and made me worry my headphones were shorting out. Similar techniques were used throughout and although the songs very in speed and tone the beat and craft can be repetitive. I decided to give the album a chance and listened to it more. It did grow om me. Still it is a bit of a disappointment.
3,Don't buy the hype.,"The French have never been pioneers of the electronica music genre. Daft Punk is good for a few tracks every once in a while, but after three albums, they get dull. The same goes for ""Cross""; good tracks are few and far between. Many are often just generic ""techno"" mainstream crap, but there are a few gold tracks, namely DANCE, with DVNO's groovy beat with a decent singer, but being a tad boring after a minute. I'm already bored of their career after only one album."
2,This Gets Old Fast,"This music has been done better by other people. I admit they assembled things a little differently, with a harder sound, but I don't hear the layers and depth of production that I've heard on other leading albums in this genre. Maybe you have to experience it live."
4,I love it!,"Great Album ! creative but not as strong as the 1st three albums "" God own medicine"" Children and Carved in sand.Tim Palmer the ex producer of the first mission Albums helped Hussey a lot in giving his /their songs the Goth feelwhile John paul Jones in Children gave Hussey the Led zepplin feelIn neverland Hussey without any production support made a great Job ! Mission Fans will certainly enjoy songs as Swoon , Neverland , Swim with the dolphines and daddy going to heaven now--if ur a mission Fan u will certainly love bands as Muse , U2 , All about eve , the jesus and mary chain and the Sisters of mercy"
5,A touching rememberance of my childhood....,"This book is a signifigant part of me. When I was in third grade I played Little Grunt in a school theatre adaption of the book. I have forever remembered the experience, and that book has been one of my favorite children's books ever since. My review may not be about the technicalities or what my favorite moments about the book were, but a memo stating that this book was an inspiration for me. Perhaps it may be an inspiration for you or a child. I am so glad to have the memory of taking part in a rendition of such a wonderful book."
3,Too many people !!!,"I have to admit, I have yet to finish this book, although I have started it twice. I have never read a book with so many characters. Before you get to page 50, you have had so many characters introduced, that I for one, cannot keep track of who is who. I intend to finish the book on recommendation from a friend and the fact that I usually enjoy Margolin books. This book has me very frustrated keeping track of so many characters."
4,"A good, quick read that keeps you turning the pages!","As always, Phillip Margolin keeps the heat turned up in this latest mystery/thriller. At times, it is a bit difficult to keep the characters straight but all in all, it is worth the time spent. I recommend his work to all interested in this particular genre."
2,Not a very good read!,"The plot is just too convoluted to be appreciated. There are too many characters, many of who don't really add much to the story. So many of the people we meet are involved in the conspiracy at the heart of the book, that one wonders who is left who is honest and can be trusted. Some of the people, mainly the accused murderer and his moll, are shady, disreputable figures, and to make them the protagonists of the story doesn't ring true.Not a very good read."
4,Margolin does it again,Margolin does it again. A great mystery/thriller with characters that were easy to care about and a story line that kept you guessing until the end. The plot was solid and the story fast paced.A great read!
2,Margolin is going downhill,"I used to love Margolin books but the last book he wrote I actually went back to see if I had been mistaken about the quality of his other books. I wasn't, he was the author of many books I had loved. So, I figured he was having an off book. However, this book confirms it for me, he does not write anywhere near with the depth of character and plot that he used to. This book is fair, but not good. Amanda Jaffe lacks any reality and it seems that Margolin, like several other authors, is just trying to hook onto a series character to sell books. This character holds no spark or interest. I actually did not even finish this book."
4,Fantastic!,"This was the first book that I have read of Phillip Margolin's - he is an excellent writer. I enjoyed the plot and the suspense - If you enjoy reading books written by John Grisham, Michael Crichton and James Patterson - then you should enjoy Margoin."
2,Quite disappointed by this non-thrilling book...,"I was quite disappointed by this book, which quite simply was not thrilling. I previously read ""Gone but not forgotten"" by the same author, and was just thrilled with that one. This one, however, was a dry political thriller. I didn't care about any of the characters, and found the situations to be quite stock in the political thriller genre.If you're looking for a thriller, look elsewhere!"
3,Close to 4 stars,"I stumbled on Philip Margolin recently, this is his second that I've read. Before this, I read Wild Justice which also featured Amanda Jaffe. I like her though I feel I got to know her a little better in the first book than here. The book begins with a long ago shootout in a drug house - and a real surprise. Then it comes forward in time and gives readers some clever twists.One of my tests for any book is how many times I put it down. This one got second listed several times over two or three weeks. Still I liked it, and will read a few more from this guy, but I wish I had enjoyed it 4 stars worth."
3,A Great Escape Read,"There are times I really wish for half stars . . . this one is worth 3.5.It is rare in reading a mystery of this nature that I'm actually surprised by something, and Margolin got me twice. Won't reveal what events surprised me, but there were just a couple of ""twists"" that were not completely predictable.Add that to an interesting plot, a satisfying ending, likeable (if flawed) characters and appropriate development of both story and characters, and I'd have to classify this as a winner.I'd recommend it to anyone wanting a quick escape from the ordinary."
3,Not as good as previous books,"I have enjoyed previous Philip Margolin books, particularly ""Gone But Not Forgotton"". ""Ties That Bind"" is also enjoyable, but not as much as the others. One reason is that there are too many characters in this story and I could not keep track of them."
4,MISSGYDER TOTALLY MISGUIDED,"This is not so much a review as a rebuttal; I was the orchestrator for this album, MISSGYDER's assertion of totally synthesized sound is totally incorrect: the charts were played by 4 reeds, 3 trumpets, 2 trombones, tuba, harp, percussion, drums, keyboards, and a string section. I sorry the sound didn't meet the approval of the reviewer labeled MISSGYDER, but I can testify to the reality of the orchestra, the players, and my scores which are at the Library of congress."
5,Garage 'em all,"A collection of cover songs by metallica. Origionally recorded by bands like Discharge, Diamond Head, Motorhead, Misfits,Queen. My favourite's of this are Die,Die my darling, Helpless, It's electric, Am I evil?. But I also like Loverman. I thought it was going to be wimpy song at first but then sudenly burst out into the lound Metallica stuff. then back into the quiet and then, well anyway's it's cool. And then there's the one that's probably my favourite So What. The lyric's may be vulger and disgusting in many verses but I like the music and the main message of the song. SO WHAT."
4,Difference You Can Here,"For those who claim that Metallica has not sold out, simply remove Disc 1 of Garage Inc. from your cd players and insert Disc 2. Covering songs by similar bands on both, a certain ferocity is lost between the two discs. Yes I prefer the second disc. The Small Hours, The Wait, Blitzkrieg, Am I Evil?, and Helpless all represent beautiful genuine thrash innovation. Plus Metallica nails them. The punkier crazy songs were cool as well, So What, Last Caress/Green Hell, Crash Course in Brain Surgery. I enjoyed all but the last few songs of disc 2. Disc 1 is not terrible, but it could have been better. Highlights include Whiskey in the Jar, Tuesday's Gone, It's Electric, Sabbra Cadabra, Mercyful Fate, and the incredible Turn the Page. Fans of Metallica and fans of the original will like."
2,Garbage Inc.,"The first disc in this set is total trash, but the second's a keeper. Brings me back to the days when Metallica rocked. Believe it or not, there was a time when these guys gave no thought of pandering to the MTV crowd."
4,Some descent remakes of good classic rock songs,"Astronomy remake,Sabbrah caddabra, whiskey in a jar were all good remakes in this album although i like the orginal artist's versions better. Blue oyster cult, Black Sabbath etc are still some of my favorite CLassic rock and metal bands of all time.I was defitely happy to see that they had their songs on disc 2 that goes back to their good old legendary garage metal days back when it was Hard and True metal. Espically the fact that Am I evil and Blizereig were on here this was great cause i never could find an original copy of Kill em All with these songs on it . I would recommend this album due to several great songs on disc 2 from their early years and also some of their good remakes of good classic rock remake songs on disc 1."
3,find a hard rock buddy,"The way I see this album is that, you should find a friend that likes hard rock and split the cost. Give him Disk 1 and you take Disk 2. I wouldn't pay full price for this 2 cd set because it's definitly not worth it. Disk 2 is very good, but you also have to buy Disk 1. I think is a way of showing how Metallica no longer cares about hardcore fans and just wants to make a buck. Disk 1 should have been a freebe or a different album all together. If I could I would rate Disk 2: 4 stars and Disk 1: 2 stars."
3,half and half,"Metallica finally did its fans a true favor in 1998 in reissuing the rare, out-of-print ""garage"" covers. But then they slid that favor into a manure sandwich largely consisting of the same kind of half-hearted boogie rock that's permeated the band's sound since the Black Album.Not that the new covers are a total loss. The Mercyful Fate medley is nice and ... hmmm well that's about it, isn't it? I see that Hetfield yet again chose to humiliate himself by trying to sing something by Glenn Danzig, and this time he even tried to outdo Ozzy's wailing on ""Sabra Cadabra."" Both tracks are good for a hearty laugh.No, most of us real fans shall stick with Disc 2, the collection of old-school covers by Budgie, Diamond Head and Queen. Wouldn't recommend paying full price, though; you probably can locate this in used CD bins without much trouble."
4,Metalica's Own Versions of Some Classic Tunes,"This is a Cd worth getting it shows that Metallica can do cover tunes just as well as their own material. Covers of such rock classics ""WHISKEY IN THE JAR"" from Thin Lizzy ""STONE COLD CRAZY"" from Queen and ""IT'S ELECTRIC"" From DiamondHead are just some of the great songs you will hear from this soon to be a destined classic. Yet another milestone in Metallica's Carrer. This Garage is worth revisiting."
2,BAD,"Actually I like metallicA, but i only like the songs which they wrote themselves and not the replayed vesion of sabra cadabra by balcK sabbatH. It is seen from the first accords that this is ot the metallicA, but... my money were spent in vain"
1,What the Hell has happened to Metallica?!!,"Metallica, is and always has been, one of my favorite bands, but I began to become disenchanted with their work after their Self Titled Album. Load, Reload, and now Garage Inc. is NOT music. I do not know what has happened to this once GREAT group, but something has gone sour. Anyone who has the audacity to absolutely ruin one of the Misfits great songs (Die Die My Darling) has got some nerve. To me, metallica is not even a decent band anymore. They have lost all creativity and uniqueness in their struggle to be an ""in"" band. The ONLY decent thing about this set is that it includes digitally remastered songs from ""Garage Days"" which was some of their finer work. In my opinion, if you must buy it, throw away the first cd, and add the second one to your Metallica collection. One can only hope that something better becomes of them."
