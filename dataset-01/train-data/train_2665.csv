5,Great Tool,"I initially bought a Rigid Portable Table Saw and when it was time to move it to a job site I was frustrated by my inability to load into my van without a helper. I returned it Home Depot, unused, and purchased a 10"" Dewalt portable for about the same price. The mitre guide was useless since it did not have positive stops at the usual locations. I returned this too for a full refund. I then bought the Bosch with the gravity rise stand and I could not be happier. I can load it myself into my van. It is precise, easy to use and transports easily. There are several accessories that enhance the usefullness."
4,Works great for my purposes.,"I'm a novice woodworker. Very novice.This thing works well for what I need it for. It's not all that stable, and can be a bit wonky to set up for perfectly straight cuts, but after using for a while I feel it's a great portable option, which is what I was looking for. Folding it up for storage is easy, as is pulling it out for use.I highly recommend getting the optional outfeed/side support extensions. The red Bosch dado insert that I bought for this was a horrible fit, and I don't recommend that."
4,great saw--just needs a better blade,"easy to assemble and easy to move around. very portable. heavy duty saw--cuts through wood like butter. I work as a contractor--and this is going to be my new work saw. my only complaint is that the blade that comes with the saw isn't so great--I will replace with a higher quality blade to match the quality of the saw. otherwise, a good saw that I would purchase again."
3,Good but not Great,After returning (2) DeWalt 744 contractor saws because of rack and pinion fence problems. I ordered the Bosch 4100-09. Reviews of this saw were promising. Upon receipt and setup of the saw (made harder because the box contained NO manual or Gravity rise stand instructions.) I was able to download the Gravity rise manual (only to find it was the older version) and didn't match 4100-09 saw stand.) I muddled through and figgered out on my own. Then to my chagrin the Square lock fence was off by 1/16 of an inch front to rear. There is no way that is obvious to square the fence to the table. It is spot on from the factory or else (what?) return the saw? I have an e-mail request into Bosch on this. Depending on what they reply this saw may *also go back to Amazon.com. Replacement? Not sure yet. WHY ME????
3,Would have rated higher,"First I was quite upset when I thought the price was $549 and some how was billed $579. Upon unpacking I found the table insert missing. I had to order one from Bosch, at no charge. Now it's assembled and I hope it serves my needs for years to come."
2,GOOD SAW FENCE BAD,"I DO NOT OWN THIS SAW A CARPENTER WHO WORKS FOR ME DOES MY DEWALTS WERE ON OTHER JOBS. EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SAW WAS GREAT THE LEGS/STAND, SOFT START UP WITH NICE POWER KINDA BOGGED DOWN WITH HICKORY, THE FENCE STINKS BAD HANGS UP NOT EASY I WOULD BUY ONE IF THE FENCE WAS BETTER. I LIKE MY DEWALTS THE RACK AND PINION IS GREAT JUST PAY ATTENTION TO THE FENCE TO BLADE AND TUNE UP THE TAPE INDICATOR SO YOULL BE MORE EFFICIENT. WHEN I WAS JUST STARTIN THIS OL CARPENTER TOLD ME THE LESS TIMES YOU PULL OUT YOUR TAPE THE BETTER, ITS TRUE THINK ABOUT IT."
5,Workhorse,"Bosch comes out with a saw thats an incredible workhorse,,,, Thanks Bosch,,, Also thanks to Amazon for a great price and quick delivery"
5,Good Quality,"The components of the stand were much stronger, larger, heavier and sturdier than I expected. The stand is very clever how it folds and stores. It is easily moved either folded or deployed. I was concerned about the steadiness but in limited use so far it's not even a concern.The arbor of the saw could and should be longer. The most dado I could stack was 5/8 and that was pushing it, 1/2 would be a safer limit. Probably as good as any of the portables thoughI like the robust fence, the slow start blade speed. My old saw would jerk when started and could shift your wood.Very satisfied with the purchase so far."
4,Very Handy Saw!!!,"This is a super saw and seems to have plenty of power. The only 2 draw backs to this saw is the fence system and the sawdust blow back. I had a Dewalt table saw that had a knob you could turn to adjust the rip fence to the 64th of an inch. This fence has to be loosened and manually slide it. When you think it is where you want it to be and lock the fence in place----it will move; however it seems to be very accurate. The other beef is the saw dust blows in your face. I put the blade through the stock I am ripping about 1/4"" and the saw dust covers you. I hate to admit it but I don't wear safety glasses like I should----but I do with this saw. I would still recommend this saw until I find another saw with this price and portability."
4,Bosch Table Saw 4100-09,"Good saw for home use. Came with a good blade. Safety features are fairly easy to use (and remove when needed). The only real issue I have is that the miter gauge is loose in the slot. I fixed it with a dozen drops of super glue along one side to make the guide about 1/64"" wider. Now it's tight. Shouldn't have to do that for this kind of money. I wish all the manufacturers would drop the t-slot."
2,Will Not Accept a Delta Tenoning Jig,I bought this saw because it has a good name and I liked the gravity rise stand. I had to have one that folded up due to limited space.When I tried to use my Delta tenon jig I found the miter slot is located way too far to the left to use the jig. When the jig is adjusted full to the right it is still two inches from the blade.The Delta Jig is the woodworking standard and every other saw that I know of will accept it. Why Bosch chose not to is beyond me. A tenon jig is very basic to woodworkingI will be getting rid of it and buying a Delta or DeWalt.
2,Heads up,Just a heads up.... they use cheap taiwan bearings in their motor... they fail after extended use.... AND they know it.....than a semi major motor rebuild and if you order their parts you'll get the same taiwanese junk... if you use your saw a lot think twice b4 buying....expected better from german engineering.
1,the creator,"Big Momma Makes The World is an alternative to the Bible's Creation story. The story implies that mother's are superhuman and have to multitask very well, which is the only part of the story I enjoyed. From the moment I realized that this was a creation story I felt withdrawn from it and immediately disliked it. The illustrations are very simple and very quaint, which isn't a bad thing. I like the use of the softer colors another part of the book I really enjoyed."
3,Works fairly well,"I got this for my Dad and have tried it out myself. It's a bit awkward to use and it doesn't keep your swing plane in check, but when combined with the Swingyde it makes for a great pair. The only drawback is you look like a freak with all those contraptions hooked up. If you use it correctly you will notice it does help limit over swinging a bit. Don't use it in such a way that it stops your arm from over bending. You want to train yourself to stop your swing before it hits the brace, otherwise you just get used to the brace doing all the work."
3,Works but overpriced for flimsy material,"The product does as advertised, but I was surprised at the cheapness of material. For $35 they are making a lot of profit on this device."
5,Great software for my business!!!,This software is perfect for my business. I use it daily to accomplish my task. Tons of great professional quality forms to use in everyday life.Recommendation: Strong Buy
4,Great Quality; A Little Hard to Mount,"This product is great if you're like me and you don't have a rail on your pistol or you have a 3/8"" dovetail on your rifle and/or pistol.PROS: It has windage/elevation adjustment, a sturdy mounting and even comes with a pressure switch.CONS: It is hard to mount, at least if you have any curvature in your trigger guard. I had to jury rig it using three inserts, instead of the recommended two. also, the batteries are a pain to install, due to the burs inside the battery tube.OVERALL: Satisfactory product, seeing as it serves it's actual purpose quite well, and has a very bright dot signature. For the money, you can't go wrong."
5,Magnificent!,"Spectacular documentary, definitely worth the money. There is no way you can see the views of our planet the way they were able to film it here. A good DVD to have if you love traveling and you love beautiful sceneries."
5,Movies,"This Dvd has awesome features the cinematography is fantastic. the animals look so real, is great to watch with kids."
5,Prepare to be amazed!,"Simply stunning. After years of watching the wonderful natural history programming the BBC produces, I was expecting more of the same. This surpasses anything done in years past by a significant margin. If you have a Blu-Ray player and you have children, this is a must. My kids have watched these shows repeatedly since we received them, prefering them over a number of recently released animated movies."
5,Planet Earth (Blu-Ray),One of the best natural science series made to date! In blu-ray it is great! Enjoy!!!!!!!
5,Amazing!,"This is a breathtaking documentary, for anyone with even the slightest interest in nature! Looks AMAZING!"
3,"Great documentary, poor manufacture!",This is some of the most spectacular footage that I have ever seen on an HD television! I would give it 5 stars if it were not for the fact that most of the disks were scratched and my player locked up on playback on all but one disk! I got a replacement promptly from Amazon just to discover that the new set was in just as bad condition as the first. Buyer beware!!!!!!!!
2,Disappointed,"We have watched the TV series Planet Earth narrated by Sigourney Weaver and have enjoyed it immensely. We bought the DVD set narrated by David Attenborough and were highly disappointed. Mr. Attenborough's voice is not the problem; the problem lies with the balance between the volume of his voice and that of the music. The volume has to be turned up to hear his voice, in which case the music volume becomes intolerable. We found ourselves straining to hear what he was saying and playing it back to listen to what we missed. It is such beautiful photography, it is a shame that it is so poorly produced. Instead of taking us on a wonderful serene voyage around the planet, we found our experience quite stressful and had to return the discs."
2,A Thousand Flapping Macroblocks,"I can't get beyond the fact that this title is over compressed to fit on the discs. It's easy to see in scenes like the large numbers of birds in flight where there's more compression artifacts than birds visible. I notice it all over the rest of the content as well. It's very discouraging and has taken a lot away from what this title could have been. If they reduced the number of episodes per disc and turned up the bit-rate we'd have an amazing Blu-ray. The wonderful camerawork, footage and narration make this title interesting. Unfortunately the technical aspects of the Blu-ray transfer are a mess."
5,Planet Earth Blu-ray BBC is incredible,"This Blu-ray series from the BBC is breathtaking. As we have been watching each segment, we continue to be blown away by the stunning scenes, beautiful music, and great narration. Even if you aren't into documentaries, this is still a series you will want to own to go with your HDTV and Blu-ray. It's over 9 hours of beautiful content."
5,An excellent nature series,"I haven't seen them all yet, but the 2 discs that I have watched have some breathtaking scenes. This series covers the breadth of a topic very well.Of course, since the topics have a lot of breadth they are not able to provide a comprehensive in-depth dive into each of the individual parts of a topic. Nonetheless, each topic is a joy to watch and plenty of new things to learn even for the avid nature enthusiast.Even if it does not become a collector item, its a keeper."
5,You already know this rules.,"God, I love David Attenborough. Come on, you don't need a review to know this series is the bomb. Buy it. The Planet Earth Diaries - a 10 min. behind the scenes thingie after every episode - only increases its awesomeness. Just go ahead and add this to your cart, and while you're at it, get some of Attenborough's own series, like Life of Mammals and Life in the Undergrowth. While lacking the utterly immense scope of Planet Earth, they surpass it in both depth and the fact that you get all the irascible charm of Attenborough in-the-flesh, such as him fending off an angry bull elephant seal with a pole in Life of Mammals."
2,NOT 1080P,"I am huge fan of Planet Earth. it's my third time buying Planet Earth for different video formats(regular dvd, HD dvd, BlueRay). I am surprised and disappointed on this(blueray)one. the picture on the product review on amazon.com, it shows some of ""5 disc set"" cover, but it is actually a 4disc set. and also back cover says video format on this blueray is 1080i instead of 1080P. i bought Planet Earth for HD dvd 2years ago, it was clearly said on back cover that the video format was 1080P. I am very disappointed in purchasing this blue ray from amazon.com, Amazon.com MUST fix all the confusing pictures for the product review and make sure to show on website its video format which is 1080i, and only contains 4 disc. i know there are Planet Eart Blue Ray in 1080P format. I am just wondering if I could find it from this site... Just be careful for what you are getting guys !!!"
2,"Weaver's narration a letdown....can't touch ""Nature""","I found the series to be run of the mill and Weaver's horrible narration makes it inconceivable to re-watch. Attenborough's solo work, especially his 'bird series' is far superior, he can capture an audience with his voice alone, Weaver never found the right voice for these ""all too in love with themselves"" images. I don't care how long it took to get the penguin or snow leopard sequences...a major disappointment on all levels. ""Nature"" still stands as the leader in the natural world documentary sweepstakes, head and shoulders above this failed effort."
4,Beauty on TV,We just received a BluRay and we were so glad to watch this beauty on our TV. We watched the series through our HD service but this is so much better.
5,Amazing!,"This series is awesome and educational. I'll ask my kids if they want to watch the next episode and they'll answer ""no"". So, I turn it on and start watching it myself and the next thing you know all 3 of them are sitting on the couch next to me totally absorbed in the dramatic and beautiful story of nature. The blu-ray version is so life-like that you forget you're in the comfort of your home... A nice surround-sound system helps too as the sound quality is excellent."
4,Great series -- no behind the scenes footage,"The Planet Earth series by BBC is absolutely fantastic. You do not have to be an environmentalist to enjoy the breath-taking cinematography or glimpses of animals rarely seen by humans. Planet Earth could easily be one of best documentaries of our time. On blu-ray this series is even more spectacular.However, I was very disappointed to find out that this particular product does not have ANY behind the scenes footage or special features. The behind the scenes footage is important to me because it brings the whole series to life. When you understand what the film makers went through to get their shots, it makes Planet Earth that much more special. If behind the scenes footage is important to you as well I would recommend asking the seller beforehand if you are purchasing a copy that has it."
5,Great set of DVDs.,"This is a great set of DVDs, and the video quality of the blu-ray discs is awesome. If you have seen the program on TV, the blu-ray discs are even more detailed and vivid. Also, the chapter selection options are great and very easy to use."
5,As Good as it gets,I think this dvd set is every thing you want in a nature movie.It shows you alot of different animals and palces but never getsborring.
5,Astonishing Planet Earth,This is a truly fascinating DVD series for all ages. Planet Earth is so astonishing and the BBC series narrated by David Attenborough goes a long way in showing us with amazing clarity and beauty just how special is the planet on which we live. I highly recommend this series for anyone from age 4 to 94. The indepth information and fantastic photography is unparalleled. Every science class and school from Grade 1 to 12 should see this wonderful series.
5,Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series by David Attenborough,"I doubt that I will ever be disappointed with any of the BBC productions. This was an exceptional buy & it was a pleasure to view. The soundtrack & colors were really great, but let's not leave the subject matter out of the picture as it was well chosen along with the splendid narration."
5,Breathtaking Videography,You will be totally amazed at the videography. I just can't figure out how some of the shots were accomplished. The slow motion of the Great White Shark breaching is spactacular. The crews that shot this video must have been magicians to get some of the detailed closeups of even the smallest of creatures. I couldn't stop watching this DVD. Great buy and well worth the cost.
4,Planet Predator.,"It's apparent that BBC spent a lot of time and money producing this documentary. Some of the captured video is incredible. Here's my take on it, so far.The first two episodes contained quite a few predator scenes that may not be suitable for young children. In fact, I was quite surprised at how many hunting scenes were shown, although it is nature, and that's the way things are in the wild.I preferred the scenic episodes. The shots of the mountains, deserts, valleys and glaciers were spectacular. A few times per episode, less than high definition footage was added to fill in some gaps, and it's very obvious when viewed from a large, 1080P plasma like mine. Most of the audio was amazing. There were a few dubbed-in sounds (to complement footage filmed by helicopter) that were unnecessary. All in all, a very good documentary. Four stars."
5,top notch,These HDDVD`s are awsome. This is the best I have every seen. If you have HD TV and HD DVD player this is a must have.
3,Good but not Great,"The DVDs were new. My single complaint is that the clear plastic centers that hold the DVDs into the case are all crushed. So, the DVDs do not stay in place within the case. I fear that the DVDs will be scratched or dropped when the case is openned."
3,"Breathtaking cinematography, but not for children and families","All videos are fantastic, breathtaking. Picture quality, sharpness, clarity is second to none. The series offer an opportunity to see, appreciate and understand the nature of our Planet Earth.But there are two problems with this monumental work. First, the authors push way too much animal sex. I'm always puzzled why pretty much all the creators of documentaries about wildlife think that it is extremely important for every viewer to observe how all the animals, birds and insects mate. Why not just let them do it alone? I and my family can live without it.Second, we did not enjoy frequent, extremely graphic shots of carnivors chasing and killing, then tearing apart and eating their prey.It could have been a wonderful learning material for children, an enjoyable video for families to watch together, but unfortunately it isn't."
4,Planet Earth,DVD's in good condition and good packaging and received in time promised.Thank youRPlanet Earth - The Complete BBC Series
3,Waiting TOOOOO Long,I bought and paid for the DVD set but still have not received anything.THis is the second time an Amazon dealer has delayed or not shipped
5,Fantastic Series,"I received this as a birthday gift last year, and I still watch it with the the same amount of wonder and amazement that I did the first time. The cinematography is beyond incredible, and I'm constantly wondering how they captured some of the shots. Reading some of the other reviews I realize that I don't have the special features footage, but I'm still rating this set as 5 stars, simply because it IS amazing, fantastic and wonderful, and I don't have to see the special features footage to recognize the talent that went into this production (although it would be nice!).Also, I love the narrator's voice, the way he seems to be as awed and excited about the subject matter as I am. I do not have any problems hearing him or understanding what he's saying; everything is crisp, clear, and intelligible.Highly recommend this for nature lovers of all ages!"
5,Awesome Blu-ray Movie,The amazing footage captured in this series is even more life-like in Blu-ray. Wonderful look at our fascinating planet.
3,Planet Earth,"In my rush, I was probably at fault in getting a version with the voice over done by David Attenborough rather than Sigourney Weaver. He's good, but she she brings a freshness to the commentary. Who could not be impressed with the wonderful video. Truly magnificant."
4,Does not work on xbox 360 hd dvd drive!,"This is a great series, but be aware, this does not work on xbox 360 hd dvd drive. It would be nice if there was a warning about this listed somewhere on the site. It will only work on a standard hd dvd player. Nice, now I have to return this for the standard dvd version. What a shame, i really wanted to see it in high def.* Update: I have heard from other reviewers on this site that the hd dvd's do work on xbox 360 after an update from xbox live. This is a good thing for some, just not for me. I don't have xbox live because i never really felt the need for it. I just wanted to play games with friends the old school way, and watch high def movies. Maybe now i'll have no other choice but to get it then. 5 stars for the series, 2 stars for my xbox hd dvd player."
3,Lack of 5.1 sound is a joke,"How could they put this much effort into a magnificent HD DVD but not provide a 5.1 digital audio mix. The audio output is plain old stereo. If I spend $70 on a HD DVD, I expect 5.1 sound. In all other regards this DVD is amazing, though there are numerous parts where there is video noise that is very distracting."
4,incompatibility issues,"i did not understand, and possibly it was naive on my part, that the hd/dvd will not play on most dvd players. i tried it on 5 different dvd players before i investigated further and found only a couple of manufacurers of these machines. i was able to return the dvd to amazon though without any problems for credit."
1,Planet Earth,The BBC Video in HD DVD format did not work in the latest multi-funtion Blue-Ray DVD player.
1,Does not work in older DVD players,Make sure when you purchase this item that you own an HD DVD player. It will not work in older players.
3,Average,I was disappointed with the quality of the discs; they were incredibly smudged and very scratched which was not indicated when purchased. I don't know what I would work with this seller again.
1,Paid for Blue Ray- Only got DVD format!,"I purchase Planet Earth (Six-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005C9YZIW/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title) the product came in the window allotted. The cover and the box all say BLUE-RAY, but the individual disk ARE DVD! I purposely bought the blue-ray because it takes advantage of the amazing footage that BBC put into making this documentary (50 dollars for Blue ray vs 20 for DVD).It just seems really sleazy to have physically gone through and swapped out each on the 6 disks, for lesser quality item, the DVD format.Avoid!!"
3,Weaver's Better,"Sure the 'breathtaking' footage is the same. But Sigourney Weaver's narration is far more comfortable to listen to than Attenborough's. I opted for her HD (as presented on Discovery HD Theater in the States) at full price, 79.95, available only from the Discovery Channel with free shipping. But... ya gotta pay tax if applicable in your state."
2,"Buy the discovery channel version, instead!!","I watched the recent ""Planet Earth"" series on the Discovery Channel and wanted to get the DVD, so I bought this product. Unfortunately, this is a completely different ""Planet Earth"" product that was shot for the BBC and it doesn't feature the astounding high definition photography and imagery from the Discovery Channel version.I returned this version and bought the better one at [...]."
2,This is NOT the Sigourney Weaver narration version!!!,"I ordered this without noticing it's not the Sigourney Weaver narration version I wanted. I'm sure it's great but I wish I had paid more attention. So, if you are looking for the one seen on Discovery, THIS ISN'T IT - as far as I can tell, same footage, different narrator. Wish I had known that BEFORE I ordered it as it's a Christmas gift and now I'm scrambling to get the right one in time."
5,Blu Ray won the battle,"My laptop couldn't play this HD DVD. Since DVD is being phased out, unless you have a HD DVD/Blu Ray player or HD DVD from before, U can't enjoy the HD DVD. Searched for DVD software to download to enable HD DVD but no such thing. Probably need certain hardware not just the regular DVD with appropriate driver to enable HD viewing."
5,Best comprehensive documentary on planet earth!,A British narrator is a must for this epic documentary on the life that exists across our incredible planet. The comprehensive series includes many sets of footage that capture never-before-seen activity and leaves the viewer amazed at the wonderful creation of life that exists on our planet.
4,Gorgeous footage - but impossible to hear the narration,"I'm very impressed with this package overall. We purchased the discs, sight unseen, and find them to be quite remarkable with regards to the scope and content, as everyone has already pointed out before. There is some repetitive footage spanning the 5 discs, but it's not too annoying.The reason I am giving this disc 4 stars instead of 5 is primarily due to the audio. The narration, by Ben Kingsley, is so low in the mix that it is nearly impossible to hear what he is saying when accompanied by the orchestral soundtrack. My wife and I have to watch this with subtitles on. Only after major adjustments on my surround sound set-up, I was able to bring in the vocals to normal levels. Without surround sound in place, it was really hard for us to hear the narration."
4,"Brilliant documentary, but disks content can be improved.","Brilliant documentary, great sound and HD quality. Bought HD player just for Planet Earth. However this HD release could be improved:- MUST (would pay more money for it!): Add another audiotrack with Sigourney Weaver narration from Planet Earth broadcast on USA Discovery channel. David Attenborough's voice sounds too old for my ears. Some people want David's narration badly, but why not have both if technology allows?- Use dramatic Discovery's theatrical trailer in the beginning of every disk - not a sunrise from space.- Add more chapter markers - currently only 5 per episode.- Increase volume on the center channel - I had to turn on dialog enhancement feature on my player just to hear narrator's voice (or may be this is just my setup, although center channel sound on other HD DVDs plays fine)."
2,Bad background picture quality,Many of the scenes have very bad background picture quality (snowy is the best way to describe it). Big disappointment given that I was expecting picture quality to be awesome.
2,Great series: Bad purchase,I loved the series. It was delivered with in 4 days of purchasing it. It would have been a great purchase if all the discs played.
3,Good but too much to watch,"After awhile you get tired of looking at this gorgeous stuff, but there are many stunning and unusual parts of this BR and the quality is great."
2,Looks great -- when and if it works,"Bought a new top-end SONY Blu-ray player. Bought a few Blu-ray disks - everything was okay. Planet Earth is a different story. When it works, it looks great. Problem is, it hangs up. Almost every title locks up the DVD player. Even with Amazon, returning a product is a hassle - it takes way too much time. Shame is, I was really looking forward to this DVD......."
4,There is a sameness to the structure,"I will not expound upon the really incredible video captures here.However, as another noted, there is a real sameness to the structure: Food and procreation, ad naseum. If I heard 'world's biggest..largest...etc' less than 60 times in this series, I would be astonished. The narration is rather dull (not in performance but in the script). The musical contribution is variable and sometimes pointless.One cannot but wonder in awe at the dedication that produced this, however."
4,"Great series, but one disc short","Let me start out by saying that I love this series, and it looks absolutely fantastic in 1080p. Also, ordering it from here is quite a bit cheaper than picking up this exact same set from a retail store. My problem with it is that this particular version is one disc short of the full set available in the UK, and costs considerably more. In hindsight, I wish I had read more of the reviews, as I now feel a little ripped off, considering that I paid more for a truncated version of this fabulous series. My advice, if you want a series from across the pond, check their amazon site first, it may be a better value."
4,Awesome Series,"I just received the package, everything intact, and viewing this HD DVD every evening. The series is stunning with some breathtaking aerial shots and inaccessible places which you will never visit in your life-time. Truly a magnum opus from stables of BBC. I purchased one with the legendary David Attenborough narrated set. Though his way of presentation is good he seems to swallow some of the narrations, perhaps he has become too old. I thought the narrations of Alastair Fothergill was far more clearer based on the trailers that i saw. Nevertheless we are treated to a series, for which a lot of hardwork has gone from the cameramen & the crew who have brought this biggest and the majestic sights of our Mother Earth in supreme clarity. To sum up, an unimaginable & ultimate portrait of the planet we all live in."
1,Frustrated,"Very disappointed that the blu-ray discs contain none of the special features/behind the scenes footage that all my friends have said is the best part! I paid extra for HD, and now I am going to have to go out and rent the series to watch the extra footage. Blu-ray should include more features, not less!! I absolutely LOVE this series, but for the above, I do not recommend buying in high def.."
3,"110 minutes less running time then original version, don't be shortchanged","This US version is 550 minutes, get the full 660 minutes version (Region Free), look it up on amazon uk . Not sure if they ship to US, worth checking though. You may be able to find it elsewhere too."
5,Great production and great for education,We home school our children and this is part of their animal biology unit studies. It's also just fantastic to watch as the production values for video are the best and it's well written - entertaining and awe inspiring.
5,"really, this is the best advertisement possible for an HDTV","This is some of the best nature cinematography I have ever seen. at this price, if you have an HDTV and any appreciation of nature, buy this."
5,great gift idea,I bought this for my parents for Christmas. We've always loved the series and at the price we purchased - it's an amazing value. Beautifully done series!
5,Ragav,WoW!! is the only word that i could comment on this product. An Excellent nature story which takes us throughout the world. Worth for every penny and please publish series like this so that we could have the luck to see places/things/objects that we could not imagine.The HD filming was great and a great disc to watch
3,Audio ruins a fantastic and beautiful documentry,Watched planet earth on TV where there were times we had to turn down the music. The photography was ultra fantastic. Had to send the first set back because there was no volume at all in places. The new set has the volume but places where the music is so loud you can not hear the narator at all. Other places where it is all to low and others where it is too loud. Don't know why they would let this epic to be ruined by lousy audio.
5,A Must Have,"This DVD series is great! I really enjoyed the cinematography and the narration. Each topic took me to a place on the earth that I would never be able to see on my own, but made me feel as if I were there. One of my faviorite episodes was the Jungles. They timelapsed different plants growing and competing for sunlight...amazing. The birds featured were so beautiful and unusual too. I also enjoyed the Planet Earth Diaries at the end of each episode. That gave a more in depth view of how they made that particular episode. It was very interesting. I highly recommend you adding this DVD series to your collection. I will watch Planet Earth repeatedly."
1,Planet Earth,The version I receivedTrail of Tears - A Native American Documentary Collectioncan only be seen in special licensed machines
4,Global Warming MYTH,"I love nature shows and I really appreciate learning about the planet, but I could really do without all the global warming junk that is constantly infiltrating more and more of these programs. There is no such thing as man-made global warming! The earth experiences natural cycles of warming and cooling all the time. The sun is by far the largest contributer to weather patterns and not how much I drive my car around town or if the industry down the street is operating or not. There are much more important concerns for humanity to be concerned with such as the over 50 million babies that have been murdered in the United States alone since Roe Vs. Wade. I think that's a bit more important than anything."
5,Great,This miniseries is really unbelievable if you like nature and animals. Some things you will never see again are on this tape. A must have.
3,compatibility issue,I eagerly awaited for a blu ray of this from a dealer through Amazon and wanted to add this to my collection but unfortunately discs 1 and 2 cannot be read by my Panasonic blu ray player nor my PS3. Discs 3 and 4 play fine. Very frustrating - to have to go through the hassle of returning this item and being hesitant about purchasing another one.
5,Wow!,"Whatever you pay for this series, it's definitely worth it. The shots they used in these episodes are overwhelmingly jaw dropping. You get to see things you'd never think you'd see. I'm glad I purchased the entire series. Some day we may never have the beautiful images provided here and this would make any kid fall in love with nature and all it's beauty."
3,Planet earth,Product was great. All I could hope for and some more.Only minus about this order was the long delivery time..Almost three weeks of waiting.Everything else worked out great.
5,AWESOME!!!!,"Bottom line - Every family in the world should own a copy of this documentary!!! If you want to see how spectacular, beautiful, and fragile our planet is then buy this documentary. It's the only teaching tool that I have seen that captures how precious our planet is, and how lucky we are to have it, and WHY we must protect it!!! Do your family a favor, and do yourself a favor, buy this documentary. The camera shots and narration are the best I have ever seen!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! After seeing the disaster in the gulf unfold, this documentary should be more important now then it has ever been and why we need to hold those responsible for their actions who are responsible."
5,Excellent!,This is a MUST for anyone who has a HD-DVD player. Not only is this one of the best documentaries about our planet but the hi-def picture is astounding! The BBC never ceases to amaze me with the quality of it's programs!!!
5,Simply Amazing,"Just purchased Planet Earth today on HD DVD. I have an HD DVD A-2 player connected to my sony sxrd. This film is just glorious. I have just completed watching disc 1, and there are three more. I had a choice to choose out of buying it in HD DVD or Bluray. HD DVD has always just looked that much better to me. And this is by far the best. I also have the Matrix on HD DVD, planet Earth is simply the best. If your looking to get into HI Def movies HD DVD is a greast way to get going. It's inexpensive and glorious..."
1,Doesn't live up to expectations,This wonderful series is marred by the fact that it is in a format that is now outmoded...and most consummers do not have the equipment to show it...HD DVD I had to return mine for the same reason.
3,disappointed,"I purchased this product thinking it would work with our HDTV not knowing I needed a HD DVD, and that it is not compatible with BlueRay either. Probably my fault, but very disappointed."
3,A felony in any other mindset,"I love BBC through and through! I just felt this was a bit lacking in the backing department. I was under the impression that this was to be a series about the planet Earth, but it really came across to me early on as just some political hyperbole about the environment. If I wanted to learn about that I would watch something from Gore, I was expecting this to be more of a general and fascinating documentary on the Earth and all nature's wonders."
2,The PLanet Earth HD DVD Set,"I have not yet watched my DVD set but have heard wonderful things about it. People should know that in order to watch the HD DVD set they need to own a HD DVD Player. I am sure that there are people that know this, whom are really Technology savy, but there are many of us who do not. Since there was no info addressing this on the add, I bought it thinking it could play on my regular DVD player and that I could watch it on my HD flat screen. As a result I had to return it and buy the regular DVD set. Also, the first disc is a blue rray disc. Make sure to find out if that first disc can play on an HDS DVD player, or if you need a DVD Player that is both HD & blue ray."
1,Planet Earth HD,"We ordered this product. It was supposed to be a DVD playable on region 1DVD players (which we have). The DVD that was sent was for region 2 DVD players and we could not watch it on our machine. We thought we were getting a DVD we could use.We have mailed it back for return. I would like to get a region 1 DVD, can I get one from you?Thanks, Fred Powers"
1,Way too Violent,"Specatacular views, but way too much footage of animals eating animals. Every segment in the 5 disc collection keys into the fight for survival with preditors capturing and devouring their victims.Whether slowly or quickly, this is bothersome. I can not deny the reality and rules by which nature works, however, I was unprepared for the way BBC went there and stayed there time and time again. Perhaps a better title for this series would be ""Planet Preditor."" I bought this in hopes of sharing with my children. Now, I wish I hadn't purchased it."
3,had to return item,I thought since I have a high def TV that this would work but apparently you have to have a high def DVD player to play this dvd. I couldn't use or play this so I had to return it. I will be buying the regular dvd though.
1,HD misunderstood,"I purchased the dvd series Planet Earth in HD. I had been told it was fine to play on plain dvd machines. I sent it to Australia for my daughter to play on her computer and it will not. Not the product's fault as the box says play only on HD players. It might be nice if when advertising something so selective, that the perameters are spelled out for those of us who are not so totally tech savvy. It was not a waste I guess as she will donate it somewhere, but I wish I had known."
1,British Version not American,"This is the British Version. I can't find the American version, which is narated by Sigourney Weaver, not some British guy, on Amazon. Otherwise I think the content is the same, but Sigourney is better. The American version is available on the discovery channel website."
5,1080i? Come on Amazon...,"This is not a review of ""Planet Earth"" which is amazing, but since Amazon didn't let me rate my transaction with them I will rate it here: It would be nice if I actually received what I bought. The product they sell on Amazon is listed as 1080p, but the Blu-ray I received was only 1080i. Big difference for a videophile.Because I have not been able to find it anywhere in 1080p I believe this is the only way it is produced, but if so Amazon should have it listed correctly."
5,Awe Inspiring & Best viewed in 1080p!,"My husband and I enjoyed watching this series on our 56"" brand new 1080p television while it aired on the Discovery Channel several years back. So, when I found the Blu Ray available at a great price on Amazon during Black Friday sales, I couldn't pass up this gift for the two of us. As expected, it did not disappoint. The content is awe inspiring for adults and more than suitable for children interested in learning more about wildlife and nature."
4,Inspiring,Beautifully shot and well edited series. I wish it had foot notes verify the script. Learned new facts about our planet and its inhabitants. Worth the time and money.
5,Life,This is a series that explores the different regions of the earth and shares the beauty of the planet with the observer!
3,Doesn't include same bonus features as the DVD version,"I purchased the DVD version a number of years ago and decided to upgrade to the Bluray. I am disappointed to find out that the Bluray version does not include the same bonus features as the DVD set does - namely, it doesn't include Disc 5, which holds Planet Earth - The Future. *sigh* Also the cardboard cover arrived scratched up. Kinda wishing I hadn't spent the money upgrading to Bluray as the DVD series includes more footage. Too bad. The cinematography is still phenomenal though, so it's worth buying as long as you don't care about lack of the extra 150 minutes of bonus footage."
5,Super fast!,I ordered this for my boyfriends birthday. I am a last minute shopper at times and I was in a bind to get the gift on time. I ordered this DVD and got it the next day!
5,loved the tv series on discovery,i could not even describe what the tv series on discovery was. it was absolutely mind-blowing. it was something that i thought that i would never see in my entire lifetime. but now i have. i bought the book and now own the tv series on dvd. so happy. thanks.
4,A lot of good viewing for the price.,"Well worth the money. My only complaint would be, it could be laid out a little better, menu wise."
4,Broken case,"Excellent video, good packaging and price. BUT the Bu Ray case has broken upper and lower inner flanges and even worse the hinge pins for EVERY disc page are broken."
3,Awesome!,"This is a great series. It is five star content and quality. Top narration and the best photography, directing and editing. A lone star rating is solely for unusual late delivery from Amazon, who usually exceed delivery expectation, but this understandable at festive season. Contacted amazon and promptly got reply with delivery cost refunded. As a product review, Planet earth blu ray - 5 star. Amazon customer service - 4 star. Delivery for this purchase - 1 star."
4,Great Series,The video in this box set is breathtaking. This video alone makes my blu-ray player purchase worthwhile!
5,Superb high definition BD about The Planet,"Crystal clear nature images, sublime moments, excellent picture. You will cry and be really happy with this blue ray disc. A must have to look after more the beautiful world we live in."
5,Triumphant Series,Planet Earth was amazing when it originally aired in 2006 and has not lost any of its luster since. I really enjoyed watching this series again.
5,Planet Earth: The Way it Should Be,"I've seen the U.S.A. version of Planet Earth and Sigourney Weaver does a good job. However, this version narrated by David Attenborough is beyond a good job; it is superb. There is more information, more depth and, frankly, Attenborough sounds more involved in the planet than Weaver does. Share this with your family and friends. It is an ongoing, informative, thought-provoking work of art."
5,Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series,"This is nature at its best. You have to wonder, how do they get the camera so close."
3,Bought the American version w/ Sigourney Weaver at Discovery,"After reading the reviews on the BBC version of Planet Earth, I wished I had bought this one..I bought the American version from the Discovery Store ( Blu-ray disc ) and paid $105.00. I was disappointed to find out that this blu-ray is recorded in 1080i and not a 1080p format..I get a 1080i signal from my cable provider and could have recorded these episodes on to my DVR from the Discovery channel..I also noticed that the volume fades in and out on every disc..Has anyone else bought this from the Discovery Store? Are you having the same problems? I am thinking of sending this back and getting a refund, and ordering the BBC version from Amazon..BTW/ I have a 52"" Sharp Aquos full 1080p and use a PS3 for my blu-ray discs.I also use a Sony surround system for my audio..Just a bit disappointed with this version of PE.."
1,Planet Earth Blu-Ray,I got the video I order in good shape in proper time. It turned out to be Blue Ray which my machine couldn't play so I returned it. I got my refund but guess I lost my 25 dollar credit which makes me unhappy. I haven't heard that the 25 dollar credit was put back on my Amazon account. Other than that my experience was favorable.
1,"Planet earth DVD collection, High Def. - Terrible",Not one but two shipments of this DVD collection will not play on ANY player. High Definition or otherwise. I still have both sets and am waiting for a return envelope that I was told would arrive so that I can send them both back. I would love to have a good copy of this production. Do you have any?
1,Planet Earth,"Unfortunatley, when I received the 4 DVD's they did not work. Major disappontment since they were a gift. The person I sent Planet Earth invited people over to view the cd's .... no luck. Plus, it ended a nice planned evening.Still trying to figure out how to return the cd's with limited hassle."
1,brand new broken dvd,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET FROM AMAZON. I HAVE HAD TWO DELIVERED TO ME...BOTH DAMAGED WHEN I BOUGHT THEM BRAND NEW. GO TO BEST BUY AND BUY IT.
4,Amazing earth,"Great HD picture with many years of field effort. You get to know everything for the place we call home. I like one of the sub chapter ""Cave"" It uncover so many myth beneth the cave. It also includes some of the endanger species which can rarely been seen in the wild. We should learn how to preserve our home for the sack of our future generation."
4,Fabulous scenes with low voice commentary.,"Am still going through all the discs in this offering and enjoying it immensely. The only rough point is the narrator's voice which at times is too soft to be understood clearly. You can always go back and repeat the segment to understand the words at higher volume, but don't hit the STOP button or you must start from the beginning of the disc again and search for your scene. This is one quirk of the present generation of Blu-ray players I don't appreciate. Avoid it by using the PAUSE button only, or using rewind or forward as needed to review segments of the program."
5,"Planet Earth Six Disk Special Edition, Blue Ray","This is a beautiful DVD set, the colors are magnificent. My daughter wanted the set for Christmas and I wasn't familiar with it. After buying the set and seeing the DVD's I was blown away. SUCH BEAUTY!!!"
3,Great series but episode five has faulty sound,I don't recommend puchasing episode 5 of the series online because of faulty sound encoding. The rest of the episodes play great.
4,Awesome Nature Blu-Ray,I purchased this Planet Earth Blu-ray without seeing it prior to purchase. I had heard such amazing comments from my friends that had watched it that I had to have it. Once I started watching it I was a bit disappointed since it's a compilation of the best Nature snippets from BBC. I'd already watched the majority of the 4 Blu-ray set and actually had another Nature BBC Blu-ray that had some of the exact same footage. I still highly recommend this documentary because it's beautiful and touching. The picture is so crisp and clear. If you are an avid Nature watcher then be prepared to have watched the majority of this program. The narration by David Attenborough is amazing and truly draws you into the magnitude and beauty of the Earth.
1,why no limited edition number?,Why the limited collector edition does not come with a number inside the box as it is mentioned??? How come???
3,No tiene subtitulos en Español,"Sorry for the 3 stars...but it say it come with spanish, English an French subtitles and did not....only English, y verdaderamente queria tener los subtitulos en Español.Una lastima.....Por lo demas es un 5 estrellas."
2,"Planet Earth video is Director comments, not the BBC show",All the video with little music and voice over
1,What's up with this packaging?,"Okay, this packaging looks beautiful and all, but it seems ironic that such wasteful packaging was used on this series about our Earth."
1,DVD Quality,"The movie it self is awesome and amazing! So, I got the Planet Earth HD-DVD for my brother-in-law for Christmas. It has a scratch on it which we found the very first time we put it in their DVD player. I am still trying to get it exchanged for another..."
2,HD video is great....but a little boring,The HD video quality is top notch.....but its a little on the boring side watching animals do boring animal things. My advice is for you to rent this or just skip it all together because its very boring unless you are really into animals. Personally I would rather watch an action movie in HD than disgusting animals slober all over themselves in 1080p.
2,"I don't care if you don't find this helpfull, but Planet Earth was...","Stupid and boring. The only part I liked was the forest when it showed cute, fuzzy mammals. Sure people say it's edumacational, but isn't that what schools for?"
1,Technology Alert,These are HD DVD's need an HD DVD player. Regular DVD Player or BD Player won't play these discs.
3,Shut off your phones and lights and take this trip.,"The content of this DVD is simply amazing. It takes you on a trip around this incredible planet of ours. The fierce power of nature, both beautiful and treacherous, is documented in this spectacular presentation. Thn only drawback was a technical one. I was disappointed that the video did not look to be Blu Ray quality."
2,Planet Earth,"This series included many scenes of dead/dying species, which to our 5 year old grandaughter were frightening ..We do not recommend this for young children ..."
4,Do not like Attenborough narration,"I was very disappointed over the fact that David Attenborough narrates these discs, as I very much liked Sigourney Weaver's delivery much better. I see other reviewers felt the opposite of me.Other than my personal preference on narrator, I agree this is one of the finest documentaries ever made in the history of TV.I gave this 1 less star due to the narration issue. All else makes this a 5-star rating."
2,This is a High definition DVD,"I was a bit dissapointed because I didnt see that in the first place, this dvd a high definition dvd is. I should have paid more attention on the fact that this is HD DVD. So watch out people, unless you have HD DVD players or you are planning to buy one, dont purchase a HD DVD, because you wont be able to watch this!!!"
3,Planet Earth by David Attenborough,"This is good. But we really wanted the AMERICAN version narrated by Signourney Weaver as was shown on TV. We have found that we can buy the AMERICAN version from Discovery. So, we have given away the FOREIGN version, the only one that Amazon sells, and have purchased the AMERICAN version from Discovery."
3,Narrator,"Does Amazon offer a close caption version of this with David Attenborough as narrator and NOT S. Weaver? I liked her in ""Year of Living Dangerously"" BUT NOT FOR THIS."
1,Bloody ...heartbreaking..not for kids or the soft at heart,"I cannot seem to get through this series. It is so devastating. If you're a soft-hearted animal lover or a child or otherwise...don't watch it. If you're in a depressed mood that day..stay away. Gosh, they really could've done something with this, but it is devastating to watch gostlings and caribou babies being killed in the wild..huh. Somehow, I wonder if this was not meant for us to watch in all its glory. They could've taken a different viewpoint.I just couldn't stand watching it. Awful."
5,"Great DVD, never get tired of watching it over and over","When I am cleaning or just doing things around the house, I just pop one of the DVDs watch it when I go by the tv or just listen to it in passing. It makes folding clothes and changing baby diapers more entertaining! Love the camera footage and the special diaries at the end of each segment. It makes if feel more personal to see what the camera crews went through."
5,"Way Kewul, BUT!!!","Be absolutely POSITIVE that you own a HIGH_DEF DVD player with direct HDMI connection to your HD TV screen. Otherwise, it will not play and you shold be buying the 'regular' DVD instead!!However, and since it was so close to Father's Day... getting the new Toshiba HD-DVD was a no-brainer. And if you are in the market, I recommend going to e-bay and searching for 'electricgarden2001' as your seller of choice -- unbeatable pricing and fabulous follow-up."
5,Planet Earth,Brilliant! Not only great content but you have to appreciate how well it was filmed. Highly recommended!
5,awesome,"Have been wanting to purchase this item for quite awhile, but too expensive in stores. I could'nt believe how inexpensive it was on Amazon.com. Very pleased with all of my purchases so far."
5,A must have,Every household in the WORLD should have this DVD set and every child should be forced to watch it once... every adult should be forced to watch it monthly. We are a part of something larger than the human race and this video shows you that.
5,Best documentary series ever,"Lets not beat around the bush, if you have a blu ray player GET THIS SERIES NOW!!!, it is one of the best ways to show off your new blu ray player to your family and friends to show them what high def is all about.All though its not 100% perfect (some scenes were shot in standard def and are noticeably softer and grainier and there is the odd occasion of screen banding and flickering)but were talking like 2 to 5 percent of the whole series and the myriad of breathtaking scenes more than makes up for it. As for the documentary itself, it is interesting, entertaining and educational all at the same time and doesnt get monotonous or boring as some other documentaries i've seen."
2,Bad picture quality,"I pre-ordered this set and received it today. The picture quality is terrible. I've been watching the series on Discovery HD and was anxiously awaiting the release of the original BBC series and was not happy with the video quality. I bought the regular DVD series, but the edges of everything were blurred together. I watch regular DVDs and get better quality than this. Perhaps it was a bad run of the DVD set as they might have been rushing to put it out? I am using a progressive scan with HDMI upconversion and have a 52"" 1080p LCD set. Maybe I will just wait until the HD war is over and get it on the preferred format?? Any other issues like this?"
2,Wrong narrator,"The narration on Planet Earth is awful done by David Attenborough. I was hoping that I could buy the Planet Earth series as narrated by the American actress that narrates it on Animal Planet. This was a gift but as soon as the other is out, I will get it!!!"
1,Planet Earth BBC Series,One of the discs are a repeat of another. It is missing a whole section of the dvd. Extremely unhappy.
1,Did not receive the product,"Hi,It is impossible to review something that I did not touch yet.I did not receive the discs I had ordered."
1,Unhappy,I am very unhappy with this product. I purchased the set as a Christmas gift for my husband only to find that it would not play in out HD DVD player. There was no mention of the special viewing device needed. This product was returned & I purchased a different copy that does play for us.
1,Planet Earth - The Complete Series (HD DVD),I will make it very simple and clear to every one. i got a sealed package with 4 DVDS of Planet Earht - The Complete Series (HD DVD).Two of them were damaged and did not run in my brand new toshiba high end HD DVD Player I had to unplug and then plug the DVD Player to remove one of the Bad Discs out of the Player? the other two after cleaning them they were ok.
1,No special features!!,"Man, I feel shafted we did not get the special features that were included in the standard dvd release considering we paid more."
3,HD DVD - check compatibility before buying,"I'm sure the High Def version is great for something like this... However, I bought it only to find that it didn't work with most of the players I had. It wouldn't play on XBOX, Playstation 3, or a regular DVD player. So only buy this if you know it works with your player, and know that you don't have the option of using it with anything else (reg DVD player)."
5,Awesome visuals.,We have seen this on TV and netfilx but even streaming HD is not as awesome as the blue ray directly connected to an HD tv. My wife and kids all like this series a lot so it was well worth the $25 done from $78 or something a year ago.
5,Stunning masterpiece,Simply incredible. An epic journey into the diversity and beauty of our planet that we never knew existed. A great gift for oneself and others alike.
3,expensive,"I ordered these (3) to give out as Christmas gifts. I actually first saw it on the Oprah show. By the time all was said and done, my purchase came to around $160.00 +. I started seeing it in the stores and realized I would have saved money just going out and buying them, instead of ordering online. I haven't watched the videos, and I haven't had any feed back from the people I gave them to."
5,PLANET EARTH BLU-RAY REVIEW,"This dvd is extremely entertaining, and educational. I think I will continue to view all sections over and over.The quality of the video is outstanding, and effort to obtain this must have been immense."
5,SIMPLY AMAZING!,"My boyfriend and I are absolutely obsessed with this. Never had a chance to watch it on TV, but I recommend owning it. It's amazing to watch, and I love just having it playing in the background when people are over. SIMPLY AMAZING!"
5,Planet Earth - the complete DVD Series,I had no problems with this order. It arrived very quickly and in good shape. It was exactly what was advertised. Thank you - I would order again.
5,Worth every penny,I highly recommend getting the HD versions for the planet earth episodes. It's worth every penny ($15). You will find both versions in the player make sure you start the HD ones.
3,Not an full 1080P nor updated sound,First off this Is a landmark television series. This is one of my favorite television series of all time. I would highly recommend this to anybody was not seen it before. However I was hoping to get an enhanced edition in the sense that I would be receiving a 1080p copy instead of a 1080i. It defeats the point of having a Blu-ray if it is going to have the same resolution as the television format. Save yourself some money and buy the DVD set
5,Planet Earth - Who Knew?,"Having purchased Planet Earth for my adult son for Christmas, I had thought that I probably wouldn't get to see it, but a few days after the holidays, he brought the cd's to my house to share. The photography is amazing, as is the color and the content! My wish to the world is to make seeing the world in a different way a requirement. Schools could use the videos to promote ecology and awareness of the world around us. Strangely, our dog plopped himself on the sofa and didn't take his eyes off the screen for an hour! I'm looking forward to seeing the next session soon."
5,Better than real life?,"I originally watched the first two disc on a 14-inch tube tv--no HD, no flat screen, no surround sound--and even on the most basic technology, this series is amazing.I know some people prefer the Sigourny Weaver (sic) version over David Attenborough's because ... I'm not sure why? I've never felt like I was watching a stodgy science class documentary; the footage is so crisp, so amazing, so unreal that you can't be bored. Seriously.Amazon was great on shipping two copies of these before Christmas Eve and I haven't had any problems with the discs.I really can't tell you how amazing this series is. Just buy it."
4,Pretty good,"Pretty good and like the nature scenes. The entire Planet Earth series is worth looking at, and not a bad buy."
5,Visually Stunning,"This HD DVD is without a doubt the most visually stunning DVD I have ever watched. While the series was great on TV, it is nothing compared to the HD version watched on an HD-DVD player. Thanks for the great price."
5,A Must Have!,"These discs are showing wonders of our world, so beautiful that it made me want to go and see for myself.If you have a top home cinema equippment, you will be able with these images to fine tune further more your settings. There is less than 0.5 % of SD in the discs.I agree that this is the perfect demo for a full HD 1080P screen or projector.A better-than-theater experience."
5,BBC's Planet Earth DVD,Planet Earth - The Complete BBC SeriesThe nature photography in this series is breathtaking and gives everyone young and old the chance to view the world around us from a perspective most of us would never get in our lifetimes.I like the fact that most scenes that involve an animal dying in the cycle of life have been understated and not graphically depicted. Which makes this suitable in most cases for younger children.I wholeheartedly give it 5 stars for its educational content and its awe inspiring photography. Bravo BBC productions.
5,Is there a Spanish language version?,"My wife and I are serving in the Peace Corps in Panama and would love to share this amazing series with the youth in our very rural community. But we would need a Spanish language version (spanish subtitles would not cut it in the environment we'd be playing it, nor with the younger kids). It sounds like there is a British version and an American version. Can anyone provide me a pointer to a Spanish version? Thanks!kevin"
4,Pleased,"We bought this for my dad for Christmas, so we haven't actually watched it. But it came quickly and we're excited to give it as a gift. The reason for 4 stars is I thought I was getting a great deal because it was advertised as $30 off, but later I found it at Costco which regular price was $5 cheaper then what we paid."
5,Best program you'll ever see- period.,This is hands down the best program you will ever see. It is truly amazing and you will want to watch them over and over again. The time the camera men & women stay in one area to catch the perfect shot and the timing in takes is inbelievable. I recommend this to everyone. It is a must see.
4,The Jungle,"The jungle video in Planet Earth was an interesting part on the planet earth movie. Something that was good about it was that the jungles are 3% of or earth, but it can hold up to half of the worlds species. In the jungle one of the animals favorite foods to eat is figs. Figs are eaten by most of the animals in the jungle. One thing i found out was that frogs lay their eggs above ground because there is more food above ground. Over all i think that you should buy this movie"
4,"Beautiful imagery, incredible locations, but more breadth than depth","This series has blown me away in terms of the picture quality and absolutely astounding locations and footage captured. Definitely worth the money in terms of being able to see the earth as you probably never would otherwise. The only downside I see is that the series is really geared more towards showing the whole earth and therefore does not go very deep into any one subject/area. Just as you are getting into a particular environment, the scene changes to a completely different area and it leaves you feeling a little short changed. Perhaps I am too used to watching 1 hour nature specials that delve much deeper into one subject, but I just feel that this series fails to really connect with the viewer in a certain way. Overall though, I still think it is an incredible series that has done a great job in displaying the absolute beauty of nature."
4,Awesome!,I bought the dvd set as a gift for my husband and he loved it. We enjoyed watching the series together on T.V. and now we can watch it whenever we want. Makes a great gift!
4,Hard to hear narration,"Great series, but this version with David Attenborough narrating is much harder to hear than the US TV version with Sigourney Weaver. Music overwhelm's David's softer voice at times (I have English parents, so it isn't the accent getting in the way, either).Anyway, even my teenagers sit down with their friends to watch this from time to time., which has to mean something."
1,Did not work on my Toshiba Hd-DVD,"Didn't work on my thoshiba HD-DVD.I tried upgrading my system (which is a blinded operation, we don't even know if the upgrade worked or not).Anyway, all my other HD-DVD's works, only this one (ALL DISCS!) did not work..Don't know why... but should not happen. Not a defective disc (since all discs did not work, not only one).I'm disapointed, and don't know what to do. I wanted to watch it. never had problem with HD-DVD before."
1,Tech issues,I have a Toshiba HD-DVD player and it would only play the opening sequence in a continuous loop without a menu. I could not begin play or look at a menu. I was sent a second copy and the same thing happened. I have no idea what the problem could be since I have had no problems with any HD-DVD in the past. I have heard of one other person with this problem.
1,Not what I was expecting,This isn't the Discovery Version. I purchased this for my boyfriend and thank God he realized it wasn't the correct one. He didn't open it and I was able to get a refund.
1,Is not working on X-Box HD player.,"We have two of the X-Box 360 HD-DVD players in the house and the discs would not play on either one of them. Probably going to have to send it back, if someone does not know a solution to this problem. Gave it a 1 star because it would not work. The actual series is amazing and a real eye opener to the world around us."
1,Couldn't even view it!!,"We must be technologically behind, I guess, because we were unable to view this HD DVD on any of our DVD players. In full disclosure, we only have one HD DVD player in the house, but it still didn't work there. The most unfortuneate aspect is that we gave the set as a gift to my dad for Father's Day, and he couldn't even view it!! He also has a (fairly new) HD DVD player. Inside the box there is a little note about going online to your player's manufacturer's website and finding out about available software upgrades for your player, so that you can view these DVDs ""created using the latest technology"". I wish I would have known this when I was purchasing, I would have just ordered the regular (non-HD) version."
1,Disgustingly Violent,I really dislike this DVD. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. Each segment ends with some animal killing another. The whole thing is disgustingly and unnecessarily violent.
5,You need to see this show!,I saw a few episodes of this show on the Discovery Channel before deciding that I had to buy it as my very first Blu-ray purchase. I have been nothing but amazed at the picture quality and how totally fascinating every episode of the show has been. I strongly recommend buying this Blu-ray series!
4,"Excellent series, but with no special features.","I really enjoyed this series, and was glad to add it to my Blu-ray collection. The picture and sound are all phenomenal, but there is very little else on the disc other than the actual episodes. I would have liked to see some special features like a making of which I remember them showing after the series finished it's initial run. The lack of those extras is the only thing keeping this from a 5."
5,Beyond Words,"Planet Earth in any venue is fabulous; but in Blu-ray, the visuals are truly beyond words, containing views of our planet that most of us will never see in our lifetimes. The message? This is a special place of incredible structure and balance where each plant and animal and insect works with and is in harmony with all the other beings in its individual environment, and that we all must do whatever we can to honor and respect our beautiful, incomparable home."
3,X-Box 360 problems,"Bought it, but it didn't play all my discs on the X-Box 360 HD-DVD. Just read reviewer who said you can download patch from x-box live. Only question is; why did some of the discs work without the patch and some didn't? Brilliant series though.....pity about the tech problems."
5,One of the best documentaries ever!,"Easily the best that I have watched. BBC and Attenborough have a done a great job covering practically every aspect of Planet Earth. It is a rare one in which the producers celebrate the planet and save the preachings for the bonus disc, than lament about destruction. Some of the best in wildlife photography as we see in the 10 minute dairies after each disc. Totally worth it!"
5,best attenborough ever,"This documentary series is awesome! This is the first Attenborough that I bought, and since then I have bough many more. I probably have watched each one of these videos six or so times. they are fantastic. Some of the best parts include: (spoiler alert) the Great White Shark catching seals in 'Shallow Seas', the gigantic pile of bat dung, crawling with roaches, in 'Caves', the amazing ant-killing fungus in 'Jungle', and the falling baby Mandarin Ducks in 'Seasonal Forests'. amazing!"
5,Best images in the world,"This set contains the most beautiful and amazing images of nature in our planet. I couldn't believe some of the things filmed, it almost seemed as if they were filming another planet.I have seen these at least 2 times each and can't get enough. The music used is also absolutely amazing and perfectly in sync with the picture.A true work of art."
5,Spectacular,"If you didn't already think that the Earth was spectacular, or if you forgot because you have been stuck inside for longer than you can remember, this series reminds how interesting and beautiful it is."
2,DRM is Crippling,"I love the show, but I would look elsewhere for a digital copy. The only way to watch it is through Amazon's Windows only player, or stream it through a browser, which won't be 1080p unless you have a really good internet connection. If you want to watch it on your android, iphone, PS3, or xbox, you are out of luck."
5,It doesn't get better than this.,"Amazing footage that will take your breath away. My 5 year old granddaughter asks for it often, it is just as captivating to children as it is to adults. Seeing it in HD makes all the difference in the world."
5,simple amazing,"There has been several hundred reviews already, so I dont want to repeat what's already been said.This collection is truly amazing. If you're someone who appreciate nature and animals, you will be totally blown away by the footage, the quality, and will really think about what's happening to the world. Just brilliant work. Makes you little sad, that potentially in few years many of these animals may be extinct. Very powerful, dramatic collection recommended for everyone."
5,Planet Earth (Blu-ray),Freakin' awesome. Simply this artistry and footage of this series will stun you into silence. Probably the best blu-ray title out there right now.
5,BETTER THAN ANY CLASSROOM,Excellent and educational. I love this series and learn much more every time I watch them. Would highly recommend to anyone.
5,Beautiful,This is truly a great display of our beautiful planet. The quality in Blu ray format is exceptional. This is a must have item. Will not be dissappointed
5,movie lover,bought this for my husband for christmas and he just loved it. packed for of information and history he was glued to the tv
5,Amazing!,Spectacular cinematography! Will inspire you to behold how wonderful and awesome your Creator must be! I highly recommend watching with whole family - and then discussing the intricacies of the specific creation explored and captured in each riveting episode.
4,planet earth in 1080p,"really nice edition of planet earth...6 discs with many special features and narrations, you can also turn off the narrator and just listen to the music, sounds, and watch!"
5,'Heaven on Earth',"Nearly 2,000 reviews on this dvd say it all.. i have seen in on BLU RAY & there is nothing like it, apparently Walt Disney is coming out with a big screen version of this called 'Earth'.Visually sooo Stunning that you might even feel that some of the shots were done using CGI..maybe some were!?!?never has our EARTH looked so beautifull & each one of us must pledge to save our wonderful planet for our future generations in any which way we can..this is truly our Heaven on Earth."
5,EYE CANDY,"The way the BBC team arranged these beautiful videos is really amazing. If you want to push the limits of your HD tv, play this series. You will seen in continous shots changing of seasons, waterfalls, and so many obscure places on earth that are breath-taking."
5,Planet Earth-Wow!,I highly recommend this DVD! The camera shots of the landscapes and wildlife are just unbelievable. My kids and wife loved it too! Planet Earth is a very educational and informative series. You will not be disappointed!
3,Poor audio ruins the experience,"Visually, the series is amazing. But the audio balance between narration and music is terrible. When it was turned it up loud enough for the narration to be clear, the music just blared. It finally became so distracting that I turned the volume down and put on subtitles. I am really disappointed in the audio quality of these DVDs."
4,beautiful locations,The locations were beautiful. I apppreciated the behind the scenes extras . They let me know how much work was involved to get just one shot to look the way it did. The only drawback was the limited variety in the animals that were hilighted and I thought that more locations with natural formations could have been used.
4,Fantastic series that you must see in HD...,"I received Planet Earth as a gift. What an amazing series! My original gift was the low-def version and I could tell it was a bit grainy. I traded it in for the HD-DVD version and what a different the hi-def makes! You must see this series and you must see it in hi-def to really get the complete experience. The camera angels, views, and nature that are captured in Planet Earth is something you will not soon forget."
5,"Simply Put, The Best","There is nothing better. There are no better documentaries. There are no better HD discs. There are no better passive promotions of conservation. There is no better cinematography. There is no better insight into animal behavior. I could go on.Planet Earth is at the top of its class. I can't really say much that hasn't been said about this before, but it's simply magnificent. I enjoyed every second of this series.The narrative is striking, the footage is unprecedented, the score is rousing, and these are THE discs to pop in when someone asks you ""What's better about HD?"".If you're a fan of nature documentaries, HD in general, or just quality filmmaking, there should be little debate about purchasing this. Get it. This is one of the finest purchases I've ever made and some of the greatest 9 hours and 15 minutes I've ever spent in front of a TV screen. Wonderful."
3,"Great series, poor quality for a ""Blu-Ray"" disc","I should have read other reviews before getting this one. They also mention the poor quality, grainy pictures, etc. I wanted to see this awesome effort in the best quality possible but was totally disappointed. Several scenes are just garbage with artifacts, noise, etc. What's worse is the ""good"" scenes are outstanding then you are switched to a ""grainy"" scene and the difference is immediate, like from 1080p to 480i stretched in the blink of an eye. Apparently not all of this was shot in high def and it shows (badly). I'd say rent it and don't use it to show off your system."
4,BBC Planet Earth,As expected the video quality is simply stunning and awesome. Its definitely one of those items for the cherished personal library. Educational and informative this can be shown to kids so that they appreciate the world we live in.The only drawback is that I am unable view it on my Panasonic Viera LCD TV using HDMI cable from my HP Pavillion dv5-1050ee. Immediately on connecting a message pops saying that this is not allowed and the content is protected.I want to know if this is the case with any BLU-RAY player connecting to LCD TV using HDMI cable ? pls email me on agkrish@gmail.comKrishna
5,Best Blu-ray I own,I received Planet Earth as gift and I must say its amazing. If you want test your system and see one of the most impressive nature/documentary series to date then I would definitely pick this up. BTW the version I own is with narration by David Attenborough not Sigourney Weaver so I am not sure if there is any difference between the two.
5,Planet Earth HD DVD,"This is the best documentary I have seen, and in HD its even better. Picture quality is perfect. This is a must own for any documentary lover with a HD DVD player."
5,Planet Earth (Blu-Ray),"Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]Simply outstanding, a must have if you own a blu-ray player. This is the program you use to show off your 1080P flat screen to your friends."
5,Absolutely amazing!,My 8 month old son loves watching these just about as much as I do. We are both learning new and fascinating things about our world in each and every episode. The videos are inspiring and breath-taking. You will not be disappointed in purchasing these.
5,Awesome,This documental is out of this Planet; my complements and gratitued to all the persons taking part on this project; that allow me to visit the Earth from home.Planet Earth: As You've Never Seen It Before
5,Stunning.,"Planet Earth is an absolutely beautiful series. The amount of work and hardships faced during its creation is truly admirable. You get to see a taste of it here though it does not detract from the series itself as they separate the ""making of"" sections into clips at the end of each episode and on the bonus DVD.The series is set up interestingly as well. The first episode is a general overview - ""Pole to Pole"" as they call it, and it is followed by episodes which each cover a specific type of ecosystem (caves, seasonal forests, deserts, etc.)My only criticism, if I had to have one, would be that I wish they'd had more time to go into more species of plants and wildlife, though they did select the ones they did for a reason (as they explain in greater detail on the bonus DVD.)Really stunning - I recommend it to everyone."
2,impossible returns,don't purchase from music gods unless you are absolutly sure because they will not cancel any order. I ordered from them at about 8pm on christmas day and about two hours later asked them to cancel this order. i recieved an email that they could not cancel it because it had already shipped. i seriously doubted the were able to ship something on christmas day between the hours of 8 and 10 pm!! so do not purchase from musicgods unless you are absolutely sure. the video itself is awesome!!!
5,Fabulous Music and Photography!!,"My wife and I purchased Planet Earth right after watching a segment of it that our daughter had.WOW!!! We just had to have it. It is so infomative and interesting. It deals with the various aspects of our natural world: Mountains, Oceans, Caves, Polar Regions, Forests, etc.We would recomend it to anyone interested in knowing more about our world ... Earth!"
5,One of the best DVDs ever,"Not much to say other than ""Buy this DVD!"". Every episode is amazing, and the picture quality is beyond belief"
5,Excellent,"It's BBC, can you have any doubts? It's not a HD video, what made it even more attractive to me once I use to get the previous best technology with accessible price."
3,It'a okay.,"After reading all the great reviews, I expected something a little more exciting. Yes, the shots were great, especially of rare birds and animals, but I found the narration to be boring. I watched it with my mom and even she commented that David Attenborough was putting her to sleep. Also, the music in the video was much louder than his voice, so you really had to strain to hear what he is saying. We still enjoyed it - something relaxing yet intellectually stimulating to watch at the end of the day."
4,Planet Earth is amazing!!,This is a truly extraordinary series. I bought it for my little brothers who are 4 and 6 and they love it. It's interesting and exciting enough to keep them entertained so I would recommend it to everyone.
4,One Word WOW!,"Over and over its the one word you will hear. I love this series! I would have given it a five star but not all the shots are in HD. I have a ps3 with 32"" sharp i use a HDMI, don't be a sucker you don't need a expansive HDMI I use a $20 one from apple and it looks and sounds as good as a monster cable."
5,Planet Earth,"The DVD ""Planet Earth"" is a gift to man kind from God. God's creation, sowonderfully made and well documented and narrated by BBC's David Attenborough.Heenry Dullewe"
2,Planet Earth Series BluRay Not 1080P,I just recieved a Blu Ray copy of Planet Earth from Discovery HD and it is not 1080p as I had hoped!There version is only 1080i.Why I don't know.Is the BBC version in 1080p? If anyone knows the answer please inform. Thanks CR
3,Planet Earth,"The series is very good. However, it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something with pictures rather than with a lot of words. That's why I returned it."
3,planet earth DVDs,"hubbie wasn't expecting any gifts, but he was rather excited with the collector case and loves this series. (also helpful for bouts of insomnia!)"
5,Wow!,This is an amazing program! Any age of person will sit and be absolutely amazed with each of the different sections of this show. Definitely a must have for any household.
3,good,"It was good price at that time. But now it should be cheapter than that. But anyway, I got a good deal at that time and receive item during deliver time."
2,Repeated footage is not groundbreaking,"While there are some spectacular shots in this, for your money, you should instead buy the much greater series of The Life of Birds and The Life of Mammals - at least a quarter of the footage in this series was recycled from those programs. I can't see how this is groundbreaking in the slightest."
1,Bad DVD Transfer/ too compressed / bad picture,"I have the BBC version. Great Show / BAD DVD TRANSFER!!! They crammed 3 shows plus extra (at least on the 1st DVD which I just watched). Don't they care? The transfer is horrible. The compression is so much you see branches on trees jerk around. There is no detail!!! I'd wait until you have an HD player and can buy one of the HD versions. Even then, there is no guarantee they won't compress the heck out of it. You really can only get a quality picture if you put 2 hrs or less on a normal DVD (remember 'superbit' ?) TOTAL DISAPOINTMENT! The people who spent years making this have to be upset."
2,Planet Earth - BBC Series,"Overall, I was very pleased with the discs. However, I did find what I consider to be a major flaw. At the Main Menu if I click on Play All the disc plays flawlessly. However, if I select a specific item, e.g. ""Caves"", it loads up properly but it does not play 'seamlessly'. I am then given pictures of each chapter. I must click on each ""chapter"" in order to see the entire item. I find this to be very confusing and bothersome."
1,WHY NO EXTRA FOOTAGE?,I had this disc pre-ordered and was quite excited for it. Than unfortunately I found out that it is missing almost 3 to 4 hours worth of extra bonus material. I am sick of getting less for paying more... Yeah the picture quality and sound is better but not by much when I play a reqular dvd in my upconvert dvd player. I think I will go order the regular dvd of this set... What a disappointment.. Thank goodness I found out about the extras not being there and had time to cancell my orderYodaBuds
2,did not know it would not work in my regular DVD player,Be Aware! I was not familiar with the terms HDDVD compared to DVD and Ibought this - opened it and it would not work in the DVD player. I thought the DVD or my player was broken - but it was just the wrong system.Now I have a DVD that I can't use unless I spend hundreds of dollars on a new HDDVD player - I can't send it back because I opened it - and I have yet to see this wonderful series :(There should be some kind of explanation for 'dummies of technology' like myself that it will only work in a specialized HDDVD player. Oh well....
5,Visually stunning,"Shipped fast. The show its self is very nice beautiful shots of tons of different things.... mountains, birds, lions, waterfalls, top of K2, etc"
4,Beautiful,"You won't be unhappy with this purchase. Although used, package showed little or no wear. very happy with item."
1,Unreadable Disk,This product was very disappointing due to the fact that disc 4 (Seasonal Forests and Ocean Deep) did not work. My player said it was unreadable or an unknown media type.
1,Might have been nice if it would have played...,"I purchased two copies of this from Amazon and wound up returning them both. In both cases disk 4 would not play in my HD-DVD player, the only disks so far to fail. I gave up and purchased it on Blu-Ray from eBay. The program itself is wonderful, but I'd be leery of it in HD-DVD."
3,Great Product,"It's absolutely beautiful. The reason I gave three star my regular DVD can play, but my HDDVD player can not play it. I can't enjoy it's full potential."
1,Planet Earth HD DVD set,The Planet Earth HD DVD would not play in our New HD DVD Player. Other movies would play. I do not understand why this set would not play.
5,"SAVE the FUTURE, mankind needs it!!!","This is a beautiful documentation of our World's beauty. Without beauty in your hearts, siblings, friends, girlfriend, kids, flowers, trees, parks, beaches, mountains, all animals on land in the air and the seas and in everthing on this earth for each and every one of us, we can't live a full life. We must protect the beauty and this world from those who want to destroy it for a few bucks. If we loose anyone of these beautiful things, we can not get it back. Please help save Planet Earth in everyway you can to share with others."
2,Not a good value.....,I bought this set based on the rave reviews and was disappointed by the quality of transfer to Blu-ray. I have watched the DVDs and was expecting a much better video / audio quality for the extra dollars that Blu-ray discs cost. Sorely disappointed. I think I will remember to buy discs recorded using new technology - not the ones recorded earlier and converted to HD - the difference is obvious.
3,Planet Earth - very nice in Blu Ray but at times we were literally watching the grass grow!,"This film certainly had its moments and was extremely beautiful in 1080p high definition. I consider this a good demo for Blu Ray DVD technology. However, aside from the scenes of obvious and extreme beauty, there were scene after scene of predators killing helpless prey. I just didn't enjoy that material and I would not permit my grandchild to watch it. Then, once the killing sprees were over I found myself literally watching the grass (lands) growing in time lapse photography.This film contained scene after scene of animal violence (edited, granted) and then placid scenes of watching the grass grow. I don't think this movie is what everyone cracks it up to be and I think they are being overly impressed by the ultra-clear picture, not the content. Anyhow, that's my opinion. I laid down my $60 dollars based on input from friends who I just don't agree with about this series. I guess I expected something else."
4,Beautiful but repetitive,"Don't get me wrong. This is a wonderfully shot series. However, as with any documentary, you need more than just shots. The narration is good, but the story jumps all over the place. The same material is often recycled in other segments in the DVD series.In addition, based on the hype, I thought that unlike any previous national geographic special, this documentary would have had significantly more original material than it actually did.Overall, loses 1 star for repetition and lack of a cohesive story/special features."
1,PUT THE SUPPLIMENTAL CONTENT IN,"I was all hyped up to buy this set until I found out it's missing 110 minutes of supplimental materials that I've been told are amazing that are on the DVDs but not on the Blu-Ray or HD-DVD version.WTF where you thinking? People that own Blu-Ray or HD-DVD are the people most likely to want those supplimental materials.I'll buy when they are included. Until then, no sale!"
5,Great for adults,"Great show, got it for my 5-year old & he was a little traumatized by a baby elephant being eaten, but luckily did not see the Chimp cannibals. I loved it, however."
3,Planet Earth Review,I've seen 3 of the 5 discs in the series and the images are spectacular. I do not play them with sound (audio) because my patients simply love the incredible video presented.
1,HD DVD's,"Could not play this product on our DVD player. Must have a HD DVD player, which are no longer being made. It would have been helpful if in the description it would have said ""only for HD DVD players"""
1,Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series,"I had no idea this video would not play on a regular DVD player. Yes, I can read English, but I am technically challenged and didn't know the limitations. I have an HD TV, so I had no idea my regular DVD player would not work. I don't even know anyone with an HD DVD player, so this was a big waste of a lot of money, and I already opened the package so I'm stuck with it."
1,Equipment issue,I mistakenly ordered this series without realizing that I would need an HD DVD player to run it. We had to return it because we do not own one.
1,BOGUS did not work,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and we got it and it said the discs were bad. We tried them on 4 different dvd players and it would not work. I sent it back and they sent me a new one and it did the same thing. I don't believe this to be the fault of AMAZON.COM at all. It was the creator of the dvd's. They just had a bad bunch. It was just disappointing since it was a Christmas gift.
4,"Fantastic picture, less fantastic sound","Planet Earth is breath taking in content and picture. Almost all is rendered in smooth high def 1080P. I would have wished though, that they had put a little more effort in creating a more fulfilled sound track to accompany the spectacular settings."
5,Breathtaking!,"This is not narrated by Weaver, Its David Attenborough. The other guy who got the Weaver version must have gotten the wrong one. This is the series that was on TV spring 2007. Great Series, a must watch for the whole family!"
5,Jaw Droping Documentary,I was speachless with the images in this BD it's a must have for every HDTV owner
5,Your eyes see the awesomeness but your mind tries to think but it cant be that awesome,"I had the series on DVD and I was just amazed and in awe of the beauty and intricacy with which God had created our planet. I gave the DVD series to my parents and upgraded to a Blu Ray player, so I had to buy the Bluray version. Watching on Bluray is a COMPLETE new experience, its like I haven't seen the series at all. The colors are bright and crisp. You can actually see the detail of the fur on animals. My feelings and eyes tell me the animal/ bird/ mountain I'm looking at is real and I can reach out and touch it, but my mind tells me its a combination of my Samsung 52"" TV(50,000:1 contrast ratio) and the Insignia Blu ray player (I have one of the lowest models).I think everyone on this earth must have this series, there is so much about our planet that we dont know. The visuals and narration engage you in deep thoughts :)"
4,Palnet Earth Blu-Ray - amazing pics,"Pic quality is outstanding... I think it's definitely worth it. Was not expecting the predator/prey scenes though. Yes, that's reality everyday in the wild, but I wanted to see only landscapes, scenes, etc. Overall an excellent set."
4,Love it!,Planet earth is a wonderful series to watch. Crystal clear on blu ray. Now i said it's fun to watch but the music and narrator can get quite monotonous. I would say this series is more adult oriented because there's a lot of scenes of inaction. Very pretty inaction. Of course the kids will love watching the animals. I give it four stars because there's not much else besides the actual videos. No extra features.
4,Hugely Epic Hors D'oeuvre,"Planet Earth is a mammoth undertaking of a series and the end product is one of the most fitting contributions to the High Def format in home viewing.The BBC documentary stretches some 10 hours of perfectly captured life on this planet. Every one of the stunning visuals has nuance and interest. There are almost no stupid quick cuts found in 99% of all tv or movies these days. This is 10 hours you can really soak in. David Attenborough has a soft guiding voice through the depths and heights of our journey and the audio too fares well on my surround sound.While the Blu-Ray is curiously missing the extras found on the DVD set, the only real criticism you can levy at Planet Earth is the lack of a larger narrative scope belying the overall epic vision. Instead of participants in the world we are presented, the viewer is left as a bit of a tourist.But in the end the series is what it is and how much can you really criticize 10 hours of continuous beauty? This is a must own."
1,Amazon only sells 1080i version (unfair),"I bought this item from Amazon and they gave me the old 1080i version. They said they didn't have any 1080p version and this is Amazon, which is supposed to have all the newest things. I went to Wal-mart and they were selling both the 1080i version and 1080p version for the same price. Amazon.com is trying to pull a fast one on its customers. The said they would correct this advertisement problem but they have not at all. They also sent me the older versions of 2 other blu-ray discs that I bought and had the nerve to charge me shipping costs when I returned one of my items that came in the same package with the wrong (old version)items that I received."
5,Amazing!!!,Best documentary that I have ever seen. You will look at our world differently after watching.
5,Just Great,As a europen user I ordered this blu-ray jewel to watch it on my PS3 and a Sharp 1080i Monitor and it is realy amazing - the best images so far displayed by my high definition monitor.
1,Horrible Experience,"Real rating is a minus 30! I was unable to access the DVD on ANY player! I took it to Best Buy, and they said it will not work in any player they have in stock and are unable to program any player to play the DVD. It was a total waste of money and a horrible experience with Amazon because they will not help in any way to correct the problem."
1,Pitty,"I would've bought it. The comments inside the review are worthtaking. Unfortunately, today's controversy about global warming (if ever exists), made change my mind. I was hoping to have a back-up to show my kids about the wonders of this planet, an overview, without hearing the same pathetic comments about the ""endangered species"". Dinasours are extinct because of natural selection, so are the actual life beings. Illegal hunting for instance, that is important to mention, a real fact. Global warming isn't been demonstrated."
4,Planet Earth to die for....,"Breathtaking, me and my family Love this series. I encourage any nature enthusiast to pick this one up."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"I love this series. The 10 minute extra clips (Planet Earth ""Diaries"") for each episode are cool and give you the kind of insight into the filming that you'd be curious about without dragging on and on. But if you are really into DVD extras than you may find them too short. I'm not so I was satisfied.If you are interested in nature, beauty, evolution or the earth, then the decision is clear: buy this series. I've watched every episode multiple times.A more specific note to those already in the know or who have only seen a few episodes: Caves is by far the coolest episode because it shows you things that are very strange and sometimes only exist in 1 or two places in the entire world. A species that only exists in cave waterfalls? I mean come on, that's crazy. Deserts and Mountains are tied for second, but all the episodes are interesting and beautiful."
5,Awesome: great Blu-ray demo. for friends/family,"Everyone I've shown this to from friends and family who come over to view this love it. Even the kids and adults who I wouldn't normally think would like watching a nature documentary, which this basically is. The animal chase scenes are well liked in particular and the time-sped footage of foliage, trees and even fungus makes the saying ""like watching grass grow"" be an interesting and awe-inspiring experience, especially now that it's in high definition. The narration is good, I found myself watching the first time without subtitles to take in all the visuals and audio, and will be watching it again with subtitles on to gain added insight into what exactly I am watching. This box set is highly recommended for owners of a Blu-ray player because you will be enjoying hours and hours of nature videography that is not seen everyday and for those who wish to share their Blu-ray/HDTV/surround sound setup, this boxset is appealing for most anyone who visits."
3,1080i NOT 1080p,"For a ""breakthrough"" series meant to tout it's high definition picture, this Blu-Ray disk is very dissapointing. Why didn't they produce with full 1080p ?! The picture looks way too soft. Also, the center channel output is set too high. Ms. Weaver's voice is too pronounced and the rest of the soundtrack is barely heard."
5,Planet Earth,"This is a very, very, very good set of DVDs on nature to have. There is a lot of information to learn from and it certaily bring one to the attention of Global warming. I have learned to appreciate this planet that we live in Planet EARTH. I highly recommend it!"
4,Awesome series,"This was totally worth every penny, you can watch them over and over again without getting sick of it! I wish i would have sprung for the blue ray version instead though."
3,"Good Product, Bad Case","This product should rate 5 stars, but I have two reasons to knock it.For one thing, I have the DVD set as well. It's cheaper, it's lesser quality, but it has an extra 15 minutes of ""Diaries"" that the HD version does not carry (though the extras were reportedly filmed in HD) and also two extra episodes, also not included in the HD version.For the second star down: The case itself came broken. I have asked Amazon for a replacement blu-ray case which they claim will be sent to me, but here three weeks or more on I've no sign of the replacement case, and no idea if the ""double dvd case"" the said would be sent will actually turn out to be a blu-ray case that will both hold the discs, and successfully fit in the outer box. If not, I will me much less than satisfied."
4,I like it,"Planet EarthIt s amazing photogher taken, I like. It worth to have one on the bookshelf to educated the kids or family watching."
5,"The ""must have set"" to show off your HD DVD and TV","I'm not usually into documentaries - but the picture and sound quality is amazing. I strongly recommend you get this set to ""show off"" your new HD TV and HD DVD player.Make sure you are purchasing the HD DVD version of the disks."
5,makes DVDHD worth the cost,"Brilliant nature photography with a series of vivid scenes, warning though that the eat or be eaten scenes will be hard to swallow for some. recommended without reservation"
5,Amazing!,"Words cannot do justice to the amazing footage that the planet earth series show us. I am extrememly happy with this purchase, great buy for anyone who loves to learn more about the earth they live in. One note: I specifically purchased the BBC version and not the Discovery version due to David Attenborough narrating the BBC version and Sigourney Weaver (who I did not really enjoy) narrated the Discovery version, so I guess it is up to your preference."
5,great documentary,"have loved watching Planet Earth, it's been something I've wanted to own for so long. Seeing it in Blu Ray is even more amazing. definitely worth it!"
5,Incredible Price,"I'm actually glad that HD DVD died out or else I still think I wouldn't own this. It's really worth every penny at it's regular price, but if you can find it for a good deal then it becomes a must buy."
5,EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS,I RECEIVED CONFIRMING INFO AND THE PRODUCT IN A VERY TIMELY MANNER.AS ALWAYS I GET GOOD SERVICE FROM AMAZON AND THEIR VENDORS.DEBORAH
5,Amazing Planet Earth!,"This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. The detail, narration, cinematography, all are excellent. You will be very pleased with this item."
4,A must have!,"It is a must item in any Video collection! David Attenborough is not only an excellent narrator, but also has a crew of first class scientists behind him to explore the most extraordinary places on Earth.Four stars only not to make the same mistake I did: don't buy DVD collection, but treat yourself with Blue-Ray to be able to enjoy this quest in high resolution!"
5,Best HD Documentary Series Ever !,"Having seen this series on the BBC HD Channel Here in the UK I would recommend this series to anyone that has a Interest in Documentarys and has a Blu Ray player, and can safely say you havent seen anything like this before, the amount of detail the HD Cameras add to this is out of this world and the high production values make this a must have for anyone with a slight interest in the world that surronds us. Buy this and I guarentee you wont be disappointed! It the ideal thing to show off your new HD TV and Blu Ray player!"
4,Very exciting and interesting,This series is very fun to watch. It is both visually exciting as well as educational. Great for the whole family!
5,Amazing view of earth,"This DVD series not only has amazing and unique footage, but it just shows how intricately designed our planet is from the big scale Himalaya mountains to tiny bugs in the jungles of Borneo. David Attenborough does a great job narrating--make sure you get the version where he is the narrator."
5,Oh My Gosh!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This series is amazing. I have the region 2 dvd and watching it was like one of the best 11 hours of my life. The picture, the sound and most importantly the animals, places, and everything else it shows is fantastic. If you are a fan of wildlife documentaries you must own the dvd set, or if you prefer the blu ray or the hd dvd version; only that those two don't have special features, but still the series is great. And of course the final touch that also makes this series as great as it is, a narration by David Attenborough. You really need to watch this!!!"
5,5 Stars for the series!,"As I write this, there is only one other review for this series (this version of it anyway) with one star as a scolding for the packaging. While I agree the globe and color cards are a bit on the elaborate side, it could be argued that fancy packaging is only a waste if it's meant to be discarded. In this case, it's obviously meant to be kept and displayed. It does look less user-friendly to me than standard disc cases though. Regardless, the series itself is stellar. Five stars!"
3,bit disappointed,"Saw preview on Oprah, had to have. Was disappointed; fast forwarded thru a lot of sections, waiting for the ""good stuff"", and still haven't watched the last DVD of the set. I watch a lot of nature and wildlife shows on public television, and because of that, ""Planet Earth"" simply does not provide a ""WOW"" factor for me. There were also several ""repeat"" scenes about polar bears and penguins that I felt contributed to a waste of ""space"" where ""new"" scenes could have been provided. It is a good DVD; but if you already watch a lot of nature/wildlife shows, there's really not much new on it."
3,Was a little disappointed,"The film itself is incredible. My question is what happened to Jane Seymour narrating this documentary? Did not like David Attenborough's voice, hard to understand."
5,Will this be our epitaph?,"My appreciation for this series is primarily derived from the fact that it shows us things most people have never seen before, and my experience is that never fails to evoke involuntary--and frequent--gasps of wonder from all who view it. I also feel some sadness with respect to the series, because I feel it makes an apt and beautiful epitaph for the planet we seem to be irrevocably destroying. I know this is a little nutty, but I hope that if we utterly decimate our planet and most of its inhabitants, that somehow this series survives us as a testament to what was once here."
5,Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD,A excellent series with breathtaking views and surround sound. Almost seems like you are viewing 3d pictures. Would highly recommend the HD or Blu-Ray versions.
3,not fully satisfied,"I am not sure if this is an older version, but the DVD were not as 'crystal clear' as another version (which was not HD)that I viewed on my TV.I do not think that this was a bootleg copy but I am not fully satisfied with the product.The shipping was very fast."
4,DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SCREEN!,"This is a great video notice I gave it four stars would give 4.8 if an option. The only problem and I think it is huge is that the video has mosquito noise problem in some parts of the movie. At first I though my TV was busted however after more research it appears the BBC even admits to the problem and many people get the ""noise"" on the same parts and only those parts! Would I buy it again yes! And amazon's price is great. I just wanted people to know that the problem lies in the DVD and not your system to save others time and frustration.If you don't believe me do a Google/yahoo search on planet earth noise?"
5,Planet Earth,One of the best Nature Documentary projects ever produced. If you want to get the best experience from your HD wide screen TV this is the DVD to own.
3,Quite disappointing,"Very excited @ first, my enthusiasm landed lower because of the difference with the CD version.No bonus features and the picture quality definitely not up to the Bluray standards (I can obtain that simply playing the regular DVD version on my oppo player).Stick with the regular DVDs and a good player."
5,PLanet Earth,"Am really enjoying this DVD. It was a gift for someone else, but something that I can share in too. I highly recommend it.I was also very pleased with the fact that my order arrived in time for Christmas even though I initially made the mistake of ordering the HD version."
5,Planet Earth,Fantastic set of videos. Hours of great footage from all over the planet that my whole family loves to watch. Well worth the buy!
4,Great DVD and perfect for the whole family,"I admit it, our family is hooked on the High-Def Discovery Channel. The Planet Earth series is definately worth it.I haven't invested in Blu-Ray or HD-DVD yet, so I bought the standard DVD which does not do the content justice. After viewing it in High Def I can see some distortion with standard def DVD eventhough I am using an upscaling DVD player.The content of the DVD is the same regardless of format, and it is by far the best nature series I have ever watched. Unbelievable shots that make you think ""how did they get that?"" all the time."
5,As good as it gets!,"This series is the same as seen on Discover channel but is narrated by Sir David Attenborogh. A worthwhile investment, without paying the price for the ""Americanised"" version which was considerably more."
5,Cant go wrong,"Planet Earth is an amazing documentary. We wanted something to show off our HD tv and our blu ray player-- we were not disapointed. The film is so incredible, and interesting and holds up for repeat viewing. Its also great family viewing, except when the preditors attack, we have to fast forward for my 7 yr old son."
3,missing extras,I've purchased 32 Blu-ray Discs since getting my PS3 3 months ago and am getting tired of not having all the extras that are on the DVD version (especially since I am paying more for Blu-ray). This series is missing 2 extras that are on the DVD version. I am drawing the line here and will cut back on my purchases until this problem is fixed.
3,ONLY PARTLY HIGH DEFINITION,"ALTHOUGH I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS SERIES THROUGH AMAZON (Best Buy), I WOULD LIKE TO INFORM YOU BEFORE YOU BUY THIS THAT IT IS NOT IN FULL HD, AND SOME CLIPS ARE IN 480.ALMOST 85 PERCENT OF THIS SERIES IS IN 720p, AND ALTHOUGH IT BOSTS 1080i, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT 1080i IS NEARLY THE SAME AS 720p. 720p IS NOT FULL HD AND IS STILL CLEAR. JUST DON'T LET 1080i FOOL YOU INTO THINKING THAT IT IS 1080P. I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH THIS SERIOUS, AND WATCHED IT ON MY TV, WHICH DISPLAYS IN 1080P, 240hz, LED, AND 6,000,000 CONTRAST. SO I GUESS YOU CAN SAY THAT I GOT AS GOOD VIEWING EXPERIENCE THAT THERE IS POSSIBLE. THE POLAR BEAR SCENE WAS A DOWNER, BUT IT IS PROBABLY THAT THE FILM CREW WHO SHOT THAT SCENE DID NOT HAVE THE BEST EQUIPMENT. DO NOT LET THAT DISCOURAGE YOU. IT WAS ONLY THE FIRST DISC OF THE SERIES, AND IT DOES IMPROVE FORM THERE. I AM A BIG FAN OF BBC, AND WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS THAT THEY LOWER THE PRICE, SINCE IT IS NOT FULL HD"
3,Confused,"I saw Planet Earth on the Discovery Channel and loved the narration by Sigourney Weaver and didn't realize there were two versions, the other narrated by David Attenborough. I was disappointed in his narration."
3,Defective Planet Earth Blu-ray,"After reading reviews on Amazon.com, I purchased this Blu-ray title to demonstrate my new blu-ray player. Unfortunately the first disc was defective with motion artifacts and a slightly inferior picture at times. I've seen as good or better when this program was offered on cable television."
2,Defective DVD--twice!,"I ordered this DVD for my husband for Christmas because I had heard such raves about it. The first one we ordered would not play and the message ""cannot read disc"" was displayed on the screen. We tried it in several DVD players. I exchanged it for another one, and it did the same thing. I still don't know what the problem was, but Amazon gave me a full credit."
3,waiting for a refund,"As of 2/7/10,I'm still waiting for a refund. I ordered wrong item. Confirmation of return on 1/26/10. Hopefully my amazon credit card will be refunded soon! JT"
3,I love the cinematography but not the Narrator !,"the cinematography of this is wonderful but the Narrator speaks the Harry potter type of English...I know there is a American Version of this ""Planet Earth"" out there but can't find it but it did Air on the Discovery Channel here in the united states I Tivoed it in HD and the Narrator was Sigourney Weaver's voiceover replacing Attenborough ... with her voice its much less likely to put you to sleep...so if you want her voice ... go here to the link below[...]"
5,"awesome, convenient, oh and awesome","I love this series!Its on blu-ray so I was expecting to see a higher price...but definitely relieved that it was on sale for 40$...The graphics are AMAZING...my friend had the regular formatted season, even though I was still in awe with that, I was surprised that they could make it even more clear! wow!what a great purchase!"
5,Planet Earth- Amazing Video,Amazing Video and Amazing Nature and Earth we live on. Hope this video encourages others to conserve and appreciate the earth we have. I would recommend this video to anyone. My daughter even loves watching it.
5,Unbelievably Amazing!,"I caught a glimpse of this on Discovery Channel when it was originally aired. And I saw five mins of it and I was hooked. Really amazing stuff, a lot of footage that was captured I thought it didn't exist in wild life. One of the best was the feeding frenzy in Alasakan summer of marine animals and also a Himalayan Cat chasing a pray around on steep mountain. And of course who could forget the slow motion footage of Great White attacking a seal. I could go on and on about this beautifully captured documentary. I was never a nature show kind of guy before this and I have to say this is a better reality show than American Idol. Really got to give kudos to BBC and Discovery for producing such an gigantic production documentary. This is an unbelievable achievement and camera work. Just jaw dropping stuff. Makes you feel closer to Mother Earth like never before."
4,Planet Earth,"Very nice series. Photography was breathtaking. I didn't like the way it jumped all over the place. That was a little confusing. There are some raw spots. Nature is ""Nature"", I understand that. You may want to view it before the kiddies see it. There are some brutal scenes of animal killings, but not enough to turn you off to the wonder of it all. All in all, we totally enjoyed the series and would recommend it. We truly live on one heck of an amazing planet."
4,lovely photography of our planet,We have enjoyed this series. I believe it is overpriced but lovely to look at and learn from.
4,Satisfactory,"The DVDs themselves were in good condition. The container had a crack in it and was a little worn, but over all the DVDs played fine. Fast delivery. I was very pleased that it came on time. Overall, very satisfied with the service."
4,Planet Earth review,Very good dvd. Excellent production. Worth the price. Watch on a big screen and with a good sound system to enjoy the experience fully.
3,Love the Series--DVDs were Scratched,"The Planet Earth series is amazing and incredibly captivating...unfortunately, when the DVDs arrived, two of them were scratched, which caused some skipping and interrupted play of the audio and picture. Other than that, I am very happy about my purchase!"
5,Awesome,"Every aspect of this collection is top notch, from the choice of topics to how they're filmed, from the beauty of the scenes to how they're narrated. A must see for everyone, young and old. A must own for me."
5,A must have!,I had been wanting this series for a very long time. I am so glad Amazon had it at this price! What a find!
5,Unwoven,"As enchanted as I was with the series as it aired on American TV, I watched the whole thing again on DVD as broadcast by the BBC. It seemed that the Brits' original edit organized the sequence of video differently (better) than the American version and (thankfully) I could watch it without Sigourney Weaver's comments."
5,M. Cox review of Planet Earth,"[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray]]]This is an excellent set of DVD,s that give such an informative and excellent overview of our earth in a glorious format, technically superb and beautifully presented. It is also a very well presented educationalvehicle that can be watched time and again. Bravo!!!"
5,Outstanding,Wonderful cinematography! Watch it on a high def flat screen and it's like being right there!
5,Nuestro Maravilloso Planeta Tierra,Siempre me han gustado los documentales en especial los referente a la naturaleza y hasta ahora esta serie es la mas espectacular que he visto las imagenes son asombrosas y la forma en que es narrado le da mas profundidad a esas imagenes. Son estos tipos de documentales los que deben crear en el publico una conciencia sobre los problemas que esta afrontando nuestro querido hogar llamado planeta tierra para mover masas en favor de la conservacion de la naturaleza y no poner en riesgo el futuro de las proximas generaciones.Las imagenes en Alta Definicion son asombrozas y mas con un buen Plasma o LCD. Es un Producto de gran valor de conocimiento y por lo tanto muy recomendado para todo publico.
5,One of the best shows television has ever produced,"This is a must have for everyone. The series is informative, beautifully done, and captures some of the most amazing footage ever. Each hour long episode is as interesting as it is informative and visually captivating. I would recommend this for anyone, and it makes a great gift.One note about the version. You will want to get the BBC version narrated by David Attenborough, as it is much, much better than the American version narrated by Sigourney Weaver."
4,Great Family Movie,"The Planet Earth BBC version is obviously spectacular as for the visual effects, camera angles etc.. The dvd is good olde fashioned family entertainment a sorta ""Wild Kingdom"" on steroids. The dvd can get quite repetitive with the camera angles and after the first dvd you tend to know what to expect. The dvd definitely has its distinct presentation style. I would have given the dvd FIVE stars but I must admit due to the repetitive nature of the technical camera work I found myself getting bored at some points. However, in defense of Planet Earth I am one who gets bored with 95% of the movies I watch (lack of sleep). Overall Planet Earth BBC version is a wonderful family event and is worthy of your dvd collection."
3,what's missing,"Enjoy the footage, but purchased the regular (not HD) for step-father at Father's Day, and the HD is missing some of the footage available, especially the extras. Also, some of the episodes are different ~ the snow leapord scene is missing bits . . . still a great experience in HD!"
5,Superb Deal!,"When i saw planet earth go i sale i immediately broke down and bought it. It it by far the best nature documentary out there. This version is also the David Attenborough narrated version from the BBC, which i prefer to the American version with Sigourney Weaver. The only real downside is a lack of special features in the set."
5,Awesome Shoots!,"This series in simply put - amazing! These guys worked really hard to bring us footage of nature that the majority of us would never ever see for ourselves. I could have done with out the male polar bear ""indirectly"" dying (he tried so hard). =)"
5,Magnificent,Absolutely the best series of its kind I have ever seen. The colors and magnificent scenery of our beloved planet are really breathtaking. My husband and I learned a lot about planet earth that we didn't know before. David Attenborough's narration was very moving and informative. I recommend this series to anyone who loves the beauty of nature and who wants to learn more about our ever changing and vulnerable planet.
5,Best way to show off HDTV,"You must own an HD-DVD player to watch this version. Not an upconverting DVD player. Don't listen to the hype the salesman tells you, upconverted DVD is NOT High Definition. The more you expand the picture, the worse it looks. Buy this on HD-DVD and you will be blown away.HD-DVD players are not much more expensive than the better dvd players (<$300 and recently as low as $199) and cheaper than some of the high-end ones.The only downside is when you watch this with your family, the kids complain about their old tv now. Just remind them that's what jobs are for. :)"
2,Low quality DVD,"Despite being a fantastic and beautiful series, the DVDs that we got from Amazon are of very low quality - they continually skip or simply refuse to play. The series itself is excellent but be careful to get a good copy."
5,amazing,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. This is the most incredible nature film made. I would recommend this for anyone who loves our planet. It is something you will watch again and again for many years.
4,Spectacular Photography,"Yes, the photography is spectacular at times , and yes, you can only get this resolution on HD with a Blu-Ray disc. All chapters of Planet Earth may however, not be as captivating as say a Discovery Science episode. It is a story of nature and its creatures told plain and simple, as it is."
5,WOW!,Watching this on 720p is breath taking...1080p would be even better! I have just seen one of the discs so far an I was blown away. 100% of it was HD quality. This version is in 1080p compared to the Discovery channel version which is 1080i. Highly recommend it to any fan of nature programs and even casual audiences since it doesn't go into too much detail of any one topic. This has very high replay-value.
5,Simply amazing.,This is a MUST BUY for all PS3 owners as well as Blu-ray owners. I applaud BBC for this fine piece of documentary on our planet. Definitely worth every single penny. It would also make a FANTASTIC gift for ANYONE!BUY IT NOW on Blu-Ray.
5,A Great Documentary in HD for the Entire Family,"This is a great presentation to show us how small we are as human beings, how beautiful is everything around us, even in the lowest class in the animal kingdom, including insects! Its amazing and WOW especially in HD format. Its worth the money!"
5,Mesmerizing films of nature,"We just got a new LCD HDTV and Bluray player and wanted something great to watch on it, besides movies. This did the job, was great viewing and very educational in the process. Some mind-boggling scenes are in this series and I keep asking myself, ""where was the photographer"" when this was filmed, especially during some of the animal scenes. How they filmed some of this still amazes me. There are some slow-motions scenes that let you see how some things really happened when it happened so fast.Our grown children and grandchildren have also enjoyed watching some of this with us. If you like National Geographic or some of the Discovery nature programs, you will probably love this! It's a LOT of great filming of a beautiful and fascinating world!"
5,"Educational, Interesting, Free","Amazon offered this 1st video for free so I thought to myself I like watching the animal shows on tv, so this should be just as good. And it was! And yes like all good animal shows, it has a British male voice for narration. Worth the watch!!!"
1,This rates a 0 as it did not work.,This did not work and I could not return because I had opened it. I had to open it to find out it did not work.
2,disappointed,"I had no reason to believe that this set wouldn't play on my up-to-date, new DVD player! Imagine my disappointment when my excited grandson opened this gift, only to find out that it was UNPLAYABLE!!! Nothing on the ad denoted any limitations in the playing/viewing of this set. Basically, I bought a very expensive SET OF COASTERS!!"
2,Disappointing BluRay,"Buyer beware! The series was spectacular on high def TV, so I purchased what I thought would be a true high def package - it turned out to be 1080i, not 1080p and that left me wanting. My projector system simply highlighted the fuzziness of the images and disappointed the family greatly. It needs a warning that it does NOT have the full resolution implied. I did find the right resolution for many of these scenes in the new Disney 'Earth' version in real 1080p, but it does not have the full content or the great narration of the original series."
2,Beware of Formatting Issues!!!,"THIS VERSION MIGHT NOT WORK IN HD WITH SOME 1080i UPSCALING DVD PLAYERS!!!I bought this version and popped in into my Sony DVP-NS75H DVD player and almost cried because the quality was horrible compared to watching it on HDTV cable! I called Sony and they said it was a formatting issue with the DVD. Just to check, I bought the $80 Discovery Channel version, which isn't as good, and it works great with my HD Upscaling DVD player!BTW this is the best documentary EVER!!!Just don't buy this BBC version if you have a Sony DVP-NS75H player!!!"
3,From glorious to gruesome,"This is a well regarded, premium nature series with scenery so stunning (esp on HD) that at times it looks unreal. That said, I found it no more impressive that other works by IMAX or the BBC, such as Wild South America. Right or wrong, I expected a little more for $60.00, although part of my disappointment was the constant focus on a ""survival of the fittest"" theme, repeatedly showing animals being ripped apart by other animals, which I felt was an unnecessary distraction.With that caveat in mind, Planet Earth is a worthwhile addition to any media collection, to be sure."
1,No subtitles or closed captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing,"I watched my brother's copy of the DVD when I visited him. It has beautiful cinematography, but the audio narrative is not closed captioned or subtitled, so it's pretty inaccessible for the deaf and hard of hearing."
5,Beautiful HD Documentary,I would highly recommend this DVD set to everyone. The scenery is breathtaking in HD especially if you have a large screen HD tv. One of the best buys I've made.
5,Excellent,This is excellent. My kids never get tired of watching that great white jump out of the water
4,Beat701,Wow! Vive la haute définition. Images à couper le souffle. Le seul hic est que nous avons droit qu'à seulement à quatre des 5 DVD offerts en standard... dommage!
3,"Broken case, but disc works",The case arrived broken (the little central tongs used to hold a cd/dvd/blu-ray disc in place were snapped). The disc was loose inside the box but undamaged. It plays just fine.Overall I am happy with this purchase. I saved a lot of money buying it online versus in a retail store. I may switch the case out to prevent future damage to the dvd.
3,Unexpected video and sound quality issue,"I think my expectations were way too high. I expected some perfect picture quality and, at least, a normal regular sound quality. Unfortunately, there are some issues with the Planet Earth.The sound mix quality is the biggest problem and my family and I frequently had difficulties hearing the narrations behind the background sounds of animals, waterfalls, etc.Also, the picture quality - at times - was low and full of visual artifacts. I wasn't expecting this at all.The movie isn't bad and will be of interest for many, but please be aware of the above limitations."
3,"Great content, disappointing Blu-Ray PQ","The contents are great. I'd give it a 5 stars if it were the DVD version.However, I am quite disappointed by the Blu-Ray HD picture quality. The picture has a grainy mask over everything. Hence, I took off couple of stars for this blu-ray review.The picture quality is quite inferior when compared to Baraka. I know my TV has no problem because Baraka looks perfect."
5,Superb Quality and Sound,"This is my first BD Movie. I played it in my 42"" Daewoo LCD and PS3. Believe me the sound and movie quality takes us into a new generation. My wife and kids love it. Amazon free shipping delivery is quite fast too. I recommend this to all PS3 users and would like to try Blu-Ray movies. Very educational and inspiring. I love our planet EARTH !"
4,Beautiful Documentary,"I saw another reviewer wonder why they got Sigourney Weaver to narrate the version we saw on TV (at least in America) -- I would trade in this Attenborough version for hers any day -- she speaks crisply and clearly, annunciating well. He is older and garbles his words as if he has food in his mouth, and with the British accent on top of that he is much more difficult for my children to understand. That is the only reason I don't give this one 4 stars. If you can get the Weaver version, I recommend doing that. Otherwise this is a WONDERFUL documentary that my whole family LOVES. So well put-together and such amazing cinematography. Just disappointed not to hear Sigourney's voice -- nothing against Attenborough, who is a pioneer of nature documentaries, he just doesn't have the voice anymore. :)"
1,Not the version that aired on the Discovery Channel,"This is NOT the version that aired on the Discovery Channel. Here's the link to the Discovery version (which was one of Oprah's favorite things): Planet Earth DVD Set (US Version, 2007) & Steve Irwin Wildlife Warrior Wristband (Adult) Gift Set"
1,"Great if product wasn't defective, customer service sucks!!!","Show is great if you get to watch it. Well I purchased this as a gift knowing that Amazon takes care of its customers. The first set was defective so we sent it back. They sent a new one and it is missing disc 3 but we have two disc 2's, great so i call amazon and they say we will send you out a new. Then I get an e-mail saying we can't send out a new one, so I call and they say since I took husbands name off the shipping they can't send a replacement. Keep in mind the address is the same but instead of both names on address label it only is mine, should not make a difference. Then I ask if I purchase a new one and it is defective then what, she tells me just go to a local store and buy it there then. Great customer service DON'T buy from us just go to the store."
1,terrible,i got this tape and i was very excited. but it doesn't play in my betamax player..i have a 13 inch black and white full HDTV....it doesn't even have the right shape. i'm sorry but amazon is just terrible.
3,Good but disappointing,"I expected Sigourney Weaver's voice and got John Cleese. Not terribly awful, but not what was expected. That part of the product description should be in large print."
2,Lowsy Picture,"I had been watching this program on Discovery Channel in HD and this program was AMAZING! However, I just received the DVD today and this version for standard DVD is HORRIBLE compared to what I was watching on HD. Perhaps I'm biased, but the quality seems even worse than regular television. I'm going to send this back and buy the HD version and see if that's any better. Bottom line: don't buy this DVD. Find out if the HD is better, and if so, buy that one."
3,Blu ray?? 1080p??? Noooo,"The documentary is excellent, in fact I have it in DVD, but i was very disappointed when saw the first chapter on Bluray. My first impression was that it was very weird the lack of resolution im used to when watching a blu ray. Yes its true that its better than DVD version, but not as good as it supposed to be. Then I saw the specifications and sadly is 1080i NOT p!!!!. I upgraded to bluray for image quality and got very disappointed. Be aware of this."
3,Effect on the animals??,"I was very excited about getting these DVD's and was certainly wowed by the photography and format. I was disappointed, however, with the absence of sources and/or commentary from bonafide scientists. Many segments also left me remarkably concerned that intrusive photographic techniques had actually caused the death of some of the animals being observed -- particularly a polar bear and a baby elephant. The entire series left me wondering about how invasive photographers were willing to become in order to get the ""perfect"" shot then not ""clean up after themselves"" by feeding an animal, turning it around, or repairing any damage that may have been done to the ecosystem involved in the process. Commentary -- even a bit of qualified ""talking head"" commentary might have helped my discomfort."
1,PLANET EARTH HD DVD,"WHEN I PURCHASED THE HD, DVD I DID NOT REALIZE THAT HD IS A SEPERATE FORMAT AND WILL ONLY PLAY ON A HD PLAYER. I THOUGHT HD WAS A QUALITY LEVEL. PERHAPS MY FAULT.I HAVE NORMAL DVD AND BLU-RAY PLAYERS AND THIS DVD WILL NOT PLAY ON ANY OF THEM.I TRIED TO BUY AN HD PLAYER AND FOUND THAT THE STORES I WENT TO ARE NOT SELLING THEM ANY MORE."
1,don't throw your money away buying this obsolete item,"Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series [HD DVD] Stupid me. I selected the high definition version of Planet Earth. Little did I know that ""high def"" is an obsolete format replaced by Blue Ray. This DVD will not play unless you own a High Definition DVD player. I cannot return it because I opened the package, Amazon's policy. Now I am stuck with a beautiful DVD series that cannot play."
5,A modern masterpiece.,This is simply the most amazing film series I have ever seen in my entire 31 years on this magnificently beautiful planet. Absolutely priceless.
5,Great Series,"Great series to watch for adults, teens and children of all ages. Visuals are stunning and the stories are intriguing. Do yourself and your family a favor and add Planet Earth to your movie library."
5,planet earth blu-ray,I very much enjoy watching this series of documentaries. I am also looking forward to inviting friends over to watch them. The series is amazing and very educational. It really makes one appreciate how marvelous our home the earth is. I do wish that the extra features that were included on DVD version would have been included on the Blu-ray version also.
5,Amazing and excellent photography,"The time, effort and dedication given to excellency is obvious from start to finish. Thanks to all who had a part in this worthy endeavor."
5,Awesome Planet Earth,"I enjoyed the televised one on the Discovery Channel, but I enjoy the BBC version even more. Love it....especially in blu ray."
5,Great Video series.,I have seen most of Planet Earth but this purchase was for my 84 year old Dad. He will enjoy it immensely.
5,Engaging documentary,"When I bought this series for my family, I thought it would be a good way to spend time together in the evenings, while adding a little education about our world. I had no idea that the series would be so engaging and entertaining!My kids, then in middle school, loved every minute. My husband and I were also surprised at how much we enjoyed each episode. I had thought I would knit while watching, but my knitting needles sat idle through the first episode and I never bothered taking them out for rest of the series.The footage is stunning and David Attenborough's narration is superb. Not only did we all enjoy watching the DVDs, but they prompted lively discussion afterward. The Planet Earth Diaries section at the end of each episode tells a bit about the filming and showed us just how difficult it was to capture this amazing footage."
3,Something wrong,"I can't play them using my computers. I have one destop ( I bought it 4 months ago ) and a laptop. I tried both of them and none of them can play the DVDs. I don't know why. The DVDs work okay with my DVD player. But I prefer watching DVD using my computer :(Oh, Amazon is not the seller"
5,Amazing,"One of the best TV shows ever, if not the best. Very educational and awe-inspiring as you watch how beautiful the planet is and how great the vast difference of life is on this planet."
5,WOWSER!,"You think you know Planet Earth? Think again. This is the most indepth, unbelieveable presentation ever of our natural world. In Blu-Ray HD, it is beyong breathtaking. I am 57 years old and a nature show enthusiast, but many scenes were of such beauty and majesty that I was left gaping like some little child seeing his first circus ever. This is a must-have for anyone who loves this planet and its innumerable wonders. Many will come away from viewing this series and feel small by comparison. I came away feeling priviledged to be a part of the great mystery, majesty, miracle that is our home - Planet Earth."
5,Awesome,Very satisfied with this product. Very interesting to watch again and again. I have watched the cave one about 4 times this month.
5,Just in case you need one more five star review to convince you...,"...yeah, it's totally worth every penny. Before I bought it, I heard a lot of grumbling because the discs contain narration by Attenborough and not Weaver. Having not seen the series broadcast here, I suppose I don't know what I'm missing. Attenborough's narration isn't horrible, just dull and patronizing. I prefer to random up a playlist for my own soundtrack anyway, which makes repeated viewings a little different everytime."
5,Visually Stunning!,An amazing nature series with images that have to be seen to be believed. Awesome! This from someone who doesn't generally like nature shows. This one is different and in a class by itself.
5,Needed In Every Household !!,"This production is a must have for any household with a television - You will be glad you own it.Some of my favorites include: The Orca Whales beaching themselves to feed on the seals to later exhibit a possible social interaction of displaying their catch; Base jumping into the caves...and the glow worms hanging from the cave ceilings; The seasonal changes of continets as viewed from orbit around Earth; Too many to list...This is truely an amazing piece of work compiled into a beautifuly filmed and narrated production. Watching this on a good TV (42"" plasma in my home)can be breath taking!David's narration has much more character then Sigorny Weavers recorded efforts which was broadcast in the USA.p.s. While a lot of the video was recorded with High Definition cameras there is still much footage which is ""standard"". This does not impact the viewing experiance."
5,"Great, but I am missing David Attenborough voice !!!!","Everything is great, but I have problem. On my sony Playstation 3, I can see everything and hear becground music, but there is no voice of narrator. If I turn on subtitles, they are there, but narrator voice is missing.Anybody has solution, or this is error on my discs."
5,Planet Earth Review,"I just bought a Toshiba HD DVD and a Sharp Aquos 37 inch LCD HD TV. I wanted to test the system out with an HD DVD. I could not get HD DVDs at any store in town. I thought that Planet Earth would be a good one to try my new system out with. I was right in getting this DVD. The photography is AWESOME! I would recommend this DVD to anyone ! The KIDS might even learn something ! Just beautiful photography ! The soundtrack is not REAL good surround sound, but who cares? The photography out weights the sound anyway."
5,Great series,"My wife and I love this series, Its cool cause they also talk about how they got some of the shots and what kind of trials the crew went through.. Great series, all kinds of cool stuff you may not know about"
5,Planet earth - planetary sucess,A must have product in any blue ray collection.This blue ray provides Full HD quality with incredible point of view on our planet.Incredible means has probably been used to provide such sensational movie.
5,Question,Does this have the same footage as the one that aired on The Discovery Channel but with a diffrent narrator?
5,Planet Earth DVD,This is a wonderful set of DVD's. I would suggest anyone buy this that loves nature channel programs.
5,Incredible Production!,This is a fantastic collection of dvd's. I've watched them several times and will watch them again in the future. This is a classic! Recommended.
5,Glorious Eye Candy!,"If you have not seen this series, it's breathtaking, well-produced and well narrated. My wife and I watched this with our teenage sons and it actually held their attention.As for the video quality, it is world class. If you want reference quality video to show off your new bluray player and HDTV, this is the gold standard...as good as it gets."
2,Planet earth blue ray,The blue ray quality was not what I was expecting I don't know why it isn't but it's not I feel a little ripped off. And it does not come with the future disc witch is the fifth in the series if you buy it on regular DVD.
4,Planet Earth,I have only seen one episode and it was very interesting. I am planning to view the other episodes in the near future.
5,Magnificent!,"Stunning photography. Soaring mountains, sweeping landscapes, endless seas - not to mention wonderful creatures from giant blue whales down to tiny, adorable Mouse lemurs. From great forests to tiny fungi, from towering cave pilars down to ozzing snotties, fish who thrive in acid, and birds that thrive in Antarctic storms. If the mission of this series was to remind us all that we need to look no farther than our own back yards to see beauties and wonders greater than anything so far found among the stars, then it has succeeded wildly. This is one series of programs you will watch over and over and over..."
5,Great price for this special edition package!,"I bought this dvd set as a gift on Amazon after looking around at local stores. Not only was this price the best, it was also the only place that I could find the 6-disc special edition set! It turned out to be a great holiday gift! Thank you Amazon!"
5,Complete,"I have to say that this book IS complete about the XML for IE5 subject. Of course, this a Programmer's Reference so it's not a book to learn and it's obviously IE5 specific. If you can live with those constraint and you are looking to do get the best out of IE, take this book and you will have all required information.Bottom line, very practical and compact reference; but it will probably need some adjustments when Microsoft will release future XML capabilities to be conform to the W3C recommendations."
3,Verbose! Tests your patience then gets better.,"Problem #1: The publishers say ""It gets straight to the point,..."" -- I DISAGREE. Typical Wrox problem.Problem #2: In the first few chapters, sample code is either absent or in fragments that dont run as a whole program. Thus, you go thru' 110 pages and still feel like you are getting nowhere.Problem #3: Author keeps on jumping ahead of himself in the first 3 chapters. He talks early about advanced topics (""comes to the point"" indeed!) giving sketchy, partial details that dont educate an old-hat but confuse the newbie.Now the good news: If you bear through the first 3 chapters, you will get a lot. Like most books, you will gloss over lots of stuff and learn to learn from learners."
2,Koppes doesn't always deliver.,"I really do like Peter Koppes-Don't think that I don't. However, this is one of his less talented albums.Overall (in my opinion), the songs are no good. It sounds like a chaotic compilation of grungie Austrailian guitar noise. The compostions seem mostly chaotic and uninspired. It almost feels like he had to complete the requirements of some record contract obligation. However, I don't think that's the case. I belive he has his own small record label- Phantom -and, of course, he does what he wants through it.Despite the overall disappointment of the album, there are two good songs on it. ""Sound"" and ""Celebration"" are very worthwhile. If you are already a hard core fan of his and simply want to complete your collection, go for it. If you've never owned anything of his yet, start with his very first album. It's the best (in my opinion.) This one is not at all his best."
2,This Is The Weakest Of The Sets.,"As the show was reaching its last season the stars and quality of the plots and episodes got weaker.(My personal favorite was Season #3,Vol 1)Vol 2 of The Fourth Season is much better.However,if you collect The Untouchables,like me,Id still send for it.Its great to see real heros like Elliot Ness and good comes out against evil at all costs.Boy,do we need it today.Im sick of seeing cops,like our fighting men,playing drug ridden,corrupt,SS type killers and double crossing gangsters."
1,Miarda.,"Esta porqueria viene sin audio y subtitulos en español, eso no paso con las anteriores temporadas. Una falta de respeto para los fanaticos latinos."
5,"Not perfect, but cute.","My daughter (3 1/2) loves this tea set and is learning to pour and having tea parties galore. I was just disappointed when I opened the box to find a couple of pieces with obvious imperfections in the pattern. Fifteen dollars is not much for a ceramic tea set, but still. Also, the set may be dishwasher-safe, but I would not put the tiny, dainty pieces in the dishwasher for fear that one would break... my daughter would be devastated! Otherwise, a cute little set for the money."
4,Tea Party a Success,"I purchased this tea set for my daughter's 3rd. birthday. She had a tea party and invited 3 other girls, ages 3-5. The tea party was a huge success; the girls had a great time. They were able to pour the tea(lemonade) themselves without making much of a mess. The set is not as cute as some of the other's that I researched online, but it was reasonably priced and it accommodated 4 children. Also, it was smaller than I would have liked. It's smaller than the plastic Princess tea set, but bigger than some of the other sets I saw. It gave the children a lot of opportunities to pour, share, and learn table manners. Overall, for the price, quality, and enjoyable experience the girls had, it was definatly a great purchase."
1,disappointed,"I ordered this tea set for my 4 yr old grandaughter. I had it shipped directly to her. I especially liked the pattern and took a lot of time picking out the set I wanted. When i went to see her at Thanksgiving, the set she got was not even the one I ordered. It was pink, but that was the only resemblance to the pink gingham. I was very disappointed and can't take it back now."
4,Surprised and pleased,"We purchased this set in a store. From the packaging I thought it was not a durable set. I was pleasantly surprised at how sturdy the set actually it. It is small without being tiny, perfect for our 3 year old DD. The only thing that would have been nice is to have a case to store the set in when not in use. Otherwise it really is a lovely set."
4,"Good book, logical and Powerful","As I read this, I started to think, oh no, nothing new here, heard all this before. Then I realised that as I finished each section I was taking notes, building out action plans, and moving myself forward. The book was doing what it said - coaching me. I was taking action.If you have never come across this stuff before you will find this rocket fuel for you life. If you have, it is still high octane, valuable stuff, not new but valuable."
4,Before the Storm,"Excelent book, capativating plot draws the reader into the story. Hard to put down. Must have for any STAR WARS reading enthusiast. Looking forward to reading the next book, ""Shield of Lies."""
4,"Slow start, but well written","I do not think that this book ( or the trilogy as a whole ) was as bad as most everyone seems to think. I think that this book was very well written but I had a hard time with the character development. I just think that if you have read many of the previous Star Wars novels, our heros just seem a little different than what we are used to. The most notable examples being Luke and Leia. They both appear to have wigged out, Luke being a pious weinie and Leia being almost naieve. This is luckily smoothed out in the second and third installments of the trilogy and you get more of an insight into their short comings. The bad guys are great, by the way, I found them totally Naziesque."
4,One of the best sci-fi novels I've ever read,"Michael Paul McDowell is a story-teller almost of a genius. He combines efficiently several narrative tecniques to provide an amazing science-fiction story, trailing styles from Frederick Forsythe and Isaac Asimov. He also shows a great mastery of rythm and vocabulary, confirming him as one of the best sci-fi authors at the present moment. 'Before the Storm'-and the other books- surpasses in quality Timothy Zahn's trilogy, being respectful -to a certain extent- with Lucas works. Black Fleet Crisis is so good that Zahn was obliged to 'rescue' his old characters -Grand Admiral Thrawn and Mara Jade- when he wrote two additional books, some years after."
1,A Waste of One's Life Force,"I have read a lot of the Star Wars books and this three-book series (yes, I struggled through all three of them) is the only one that I have not enjoyed. To say that I did not enjoy the series is an understatement; I hated it . Leia and Luke are so totally out of character and the Current, along with its powers that the author creates as a ""new Force"", are not believable in the Star Wars universe. The entire series, and especially the ending, is so contrived and strained the only thing that I got from it was pleasure that it was finally over. This series adds nothing to the saga; life is too short to read any more works by Mr.Kube-Mcdowell."
1,Star Bores,"I am currently focing myself to read the third book in this uninspired trilogy. I won't go into story details, but it seems that the characterizations are off. Han Solo is reduced to being a baby sitter, Luke is a weakminded man with a mid-life crisis,who bows to every whim of his shadowy traveling partner,and the princess is a grump who doesn't like anybody.Aside from the characterizations, these books are boring.They read like a technical manual.The books are full of technical details,political manuevering, and military protocal, but almost no story, or substance."
2,"Good start, TERRIBLE middle and finish","The first book gave a good beginning and set up a complex storyline. However, it failed to deliver. The characters did things WAY out of line for them and half the book wasn't connected in any way, shape, or form with the other half."
2,Read Zahn's trilogy instead!,"I am a very die hard star wars fan and will read every book - that's just how I am. :) But, I did not finish this triology yet. I read the first book more than a few years ago at least, and I really hated it. I just did not get the 'star wars feeling' and the characterizations seemed off... I didn't like how it seemed Luke was leaving/abdoning the jedi academy. There were just little things here and there that felt wrong, and since its been so long since I read it, I can't remember exact events. However, it was refreshing to see an enemy besides the Empire... I didn't read the last two books, but I'll work on it. I already bought them. I should have read the first book before i did... not a smart buy on my part. They've been sitting on my shelf collecting dust for years...My goal this summer is to read every SW book I have that I haven't gotten to yet. Those two will be last."
1,Not Star Wars!,"This book probably embarassed George Lucas beyond the point of resurrection! I was forced to skim the book after 15 or twenty pages because I basically didn't care. This shouldn't even be a SW novel.... it should be one of those stupid TV shows. After this, Mac Dowell shouldn't ever show his face in an SW novel again!"
1,Worst SW Book Ever,This book is the worst book I have ever read as is the entire trilogy. There was almost no action in the trilogy and when there was it was boring. The only reason I bought this book is because I an a die hard Star Wars fan. The entire concept of the Vagabond was unbeliveble and just plain stupid. I'm almost sure (though it wasn't obvious) that the author was trying to make the book suspenseful as to what would happen whith the senate trying to renounce Leia. The suspense wasn't there and it was obvious what was going to happen. If I could I wouldn't have given it a star at all. This book and entire trilogy stunk.
3,not true star wars,"This book, and also the whole Black fleet series, was really not very good. I love star wars novels and found the series to be uncharacteristic of star wars. All the characters seem out of wack. There are also too many new factors, like an ""E-wing"" that take it away from classic star wars atmosphere. On the other hand, it really has some solid action and evil bad guys."
2,RabidFanboy,"As of today I'm quite happy to say I've read through all the printed Star Wars books that fit into the storyline. It's got ups and downs. This trilogy is one of those downs. There are some decent parts, the idea for the villians are very much like the Vong (with some major exceptions) from the New Jedi Order series and sometimes it seems they might even be the template. But many aspects fall through as you continue.In at least one section of each book a character is taken and butchered, made very much out of character or put through a useless side story. A freind of mine read the books and commented ""...its's an excuse for Luke to have sex in hyperspace"". Sadly, that just about sums up the kind of pointless side paths that this trilogy takes. I would say read if you must, there is some information that is nice to know, but don't expect anything grand."
1,Why Don't They Let you give 0 stars?,"Kube there really isn't much to say besides this book blew Bantha #*$%. This book revolves around politics. At first I was wondering why this book got such good reviews but then I reliezed that the stupid people only gave reviews (all 13 of them) The real Star Wars fans knew that it was a waste of their time. But I'm just here to make a difference, in hopes the Kube never writes another star wars book again. I don't Know what George Lucas was thinking when he approved this garbage. I use to think that nothing could affect my view on star wars. But when I read this book I have to say I lost intrest a little luckily This was the first book I ever read so in reading books like Courtship of Princess Leia, Dark Saber, Shadows of the Empire I regained that Lac of respect. I encourge people to stay away frm it unless your absolutly fastenated with politics."
1,Very Poor,"This book departs rather severly from the traditional Star Wars ideals. The author obviously had very little or no knowledge of the Star Wars universe and obviously did not do any research into the Star Wars universe to aid him in his writing. The use of ships firing ""slugs"" is just one example of the lack of knowledge that this author displayed. My advice is to not bother buying, or even reading, this book."
1,Still Reading...........,"I'm Only in the midde of the book but by then wouldn't you think it would be interesting. First they put off Luke and now he's and old hermit. Now Leia is weirder then ever, and Lando leading an expedition to fingd some ""Ghost Ship"" come on. I wish I could have picked another book with an interesting story line."
4,Want action? Watch a movie. Want a plot? Read this.,Other reviewers have bemoaned a lack of action in this trilogy and they are correct. I don't read a book for descriptions of things going kablooey. I read for intersting plot characters. I thought the character development was some of the best in the series. Nil Spaar was a superb villian.
4,PEOPLE WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU,"To all the people that are upset and whiny because this series contradicts TPM, maybe you should read the book. In the end, Luke finds out that Akanah was lying to him about just about everything. (Sorry if I spoiled something but I had to say it.)"
2,"Good at first, until ""Phantom Menace"" came out.","And it wasn't even that good before! The only interesting parts in this story was Luke going off with that woman to search for his mother. I skipped all the other parts. The Yevetha were too much like the Ssi-Ruuk in my opinion. Both thought humans were inferior, both wanted to taker over the galaxy- yadda, yadda, yadda, whatever. But, when I saw ""Phantom Menace"", I realized that we were finally going to find out who Luke and Leia's mother truly is. It's Padme, not this Nashira we keep hearing about in the Black Fleet Crisis. After that, the book kinda became pointless, and I haven't even read it since. To all you SW fans out there, spare yourself the trouble and don't read this book. Just pretend that it doesn't exist."
4,One of the better Star Wars reads,"This one seens a little reminicent of Tim Zahn's stuff, but that's just compared to The Crystal Star. It explores the government, which some other books seem to ignore. While Luke's story may seem contradictory to Episode I, it still holds interest. And who can say ""no"" to a good Lando story?"
1,This BITES,"Yuk this is space trash! Leia does not use her Jedi abbilities! Han thinks his kid looks like Jabba the Hutt.Luke runs away(How old are these guys again)Luke kills without a thought(dark side) This is the WORST star wars book ever.(that has luke,leia and han)"
4,quickbooks for dummies,"All of the 'dummies' series of books have been helpful. This one is no exception. Whenever the 'docs' from any program are written for programmers, I turn to this series to find out how to really run the software. It should be included with the software package."
5,Good,"Dvd plays well and it arrived within the time frame. I'm not a big fan of Pokemon after Diamond and Pearl, but hey, movie was alright."
3,Incorrect Version,"I recently bought this DVD based on the information on the page. (1966 version by Aurora Bautista and Julio Aleman) However, when received, it was the earlier version by Jorge Mistral which I already owned. I haven't been able to find an answer from anyone if El Derecho de Nacer by Julio Aleman and Aurora Bautista version is really for sale. (March-28-08) THIS PAGE HAS BEEN PARTIALLY FIXED. IT IS STILL SHOWING SOME INCORECT INFO. SUCH AS: Format: Color Actors: Maricruz Olivier. THIS 1952 VERSION IS IN BLACK AND WHITE AND MARICRUZ OLIVIER IS NOT ONE OF THE ACTORS. SHE IS; HOWEVER, IN THE 1966 VERSION."
5,Excellent Movie,THIS MOVIE WAS A FANTASTIC MOVIE!!! It is an old great movie that had a lot of old family ways.
5,Must have,"We watched this when i was a little kid, now over 30 years after we watched again, the whole family together with the new members, good story, and some lessons to learn"
2,Doesn't fit the application it promised...,I have a Bronco and the harmonic balancer was too wide for it. It was too close to the fan and couldn't be used. It appeared to be well made but it obviously doesn't work in the application that it was supposed to and therefore gets 2 stars.
5,Very nice compendium!,"Michael Benson, whom I know from research conferences (and who mentions me a few times in his follow-up book), has written a great compendium of information on the JFK assassination. This is truly a great all-in-one-place volume. Get this![...]"
1,Nope,There are more intelligent reads out there for sure. Reading this Westerner's appropriation fantasy on the Lenape people saddens me. There is more written offering secondary and even primary source material. The Delaware Indians is one of them.
3,How are you supposed to close the back?,"This would be a very nice costume IF they provided some way to close the back of the dress! The dress is open in the back from the small of your back up to your neck. There's a tie at the top and a tie at the waist, and virtually nothing else! No zipper, no snaps, no buttons. You're basically left gaping open in the back. Be prepared to improvise."
2,Not happy,Well this was a waste of my money. I wanted to hear great violin and all I heard was rap. If you are not crazy about rap do not buy this cd. A big disappointment.
5,nuttin but stringz,"This CD is worth every penny I paid times 2!! A mix of hip hop, classical and jazz. I have never heard anything like it!! Although I am a grandmother of 7, this music had me 'bumpin' down the road!! I have told everyone about these two TALENTED young men. This CD far exeded my expectations!"
4,Want it...,"I haven't ordered this yet, but I might just do it now. I first heard these guys while watching Noggin with my son (they feature the song ""Thunder""). I thought it was fun and different. I checked out the album on Amazon and heard some clips. I like what I hear. I'm not a hip-hop person usually, not that this is what they are, but I hear some of that in it. Whatever it is considered, I like it..."
2,Just my view,These two guys play beautifully however what is with all the motor mouthing chatter? I want to hear music not unintelligible words in the background which blocks the music. Someone else made a comment about rap. Well if we want rap get a rap CD. If we want strings we should look for a string CD. Andre Rieu or Mairead Nesbitt anybody?
2,boring,every song sounds the same. repeating over and over. would like to have seen a little more variaty on this cd
3,More rap than stringz,"I first saw this group perform on America's Got Talent and was absolutely blown away. The talent of these two artists is incredible. Their ability to play the violin intertwined with a variety of music types is sheer genius. That said, the CD was a massive disappointment. The violin music takes a back seat to rap and in some songs the violin is barely audible. I hope they come out with another CD with more violin. Look for this group to take a prominant role in shaping the future of merging hip-hop and classical music. Nuttin But Stringz are men of genius and talent. The CD does not reflect their skills."
5,Awesome Strings,These are two incredibly talented guys with a passion for playing the violin. The music is very upbeat with a jazzy flair.
4,Like Nothing I have ever heard before,"I first saw this duo on the kid's channel Noggin. They have a video for ""Thunder"" and my two year old just loved it. So I thought I would check them out. The CD is good but it's a little skimpy on the number of tracks. Like ""Thunder"" is really on twice. Once the orginal and then a remix. A few others had ""intros"" . I don't really consider a 20 second little clip a track. However the whole CD is rather good and I look forward to what this group will do next."
2,Music,"This turned out to be a bit disappointing to me. While watching these talented young men on Americas Got Talent i was in awe of the wonderful music. But the CD wasnt, in my opinion, what i wanted to hear from them. I would try one more Cd from them before deciding it wasnt worth it at all and then probably get rid of the first CD completely."
5,Nuttin' But Stringz,Great CD!!! Love these guys. Fell in love with them from the first time I saw them on America's Got Talent and these 2 certainly do.
2,Eh...,"I caught the youtube of these guys on America's got talent and was extremely impressed, and figured that all of their music would be as amazing, but honestly I have to agree with the last poster, the first 3 songs or so are pretty good, then the rest have too much just rapping with no melody, and no strings... If their name was less of a misnomer this would be AMAZING."
5,WOW!,"I am definitely not disappointed. My favorite genres of music is classical and hiphop and it is obviously the same with this group. The first song ""Broken Sorrow"" is some of the most moving music I have heard in a long time. This music is so refreshing. The first time I heard Broken Sorrow I had to get the album immediately. I will be listening to this album for a long time in heavy rotation."
2,I had hoped for so much more,They were SO good on America's Got Talent. I guess I'm just too middle American for this CD. I had hoped for more instrumentals like they did on TV. They're good but I'm afraid they have seriously limited their market. I wish I had taken the time to listen to samples before purchasing this CD.
1,Slightly disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed with the CD of Nuttin' But Strings. I saw them for the first time on TV, like most, however the CD has a lot of talking which I found very distracting, taking away from the awesome music talent they have. I would have liked the CD a whole lot more if the verbage was not present. I have played it through to the end only once because I really really was looking forward to savoring their musical talent and don't know that I will play it again because of the words. PLEASE MAKE IT WITHOUT THE WORDS...."
3,High price for one great song.,"We LOVE the first track which is why we bought it. Unfortunately the rest was just hip-hop with strings. Not that it isn't good, but it ended up being one of those CDs where you end up explaining to a friend WHY it's good. Unfortunately, saying, ""But they're actually playing the violins. It's not just a keyboard!"" eventually becomes irrelevant and the novelty wears off. Hopefully their next record will be a real STRINGS record where they push the boundaries on every track."
5,Love these guys!,I saw these guys on The Tonight Show years ago. Love the album. Couldn't wait for it to be released. Have an autographed single of their first song. Have just about worn this CD out. I listen to it all the time. Can't wait for them to release another CD.
4,"Pretty Good, but I only enjoyed 3 of the songs...","... the rest seemed to have too much rap/hiphop in it, for my tastes, anyway. Loved them in America's Got Talent! More violin and less hiphop, especially less chatting and talking would be really loved! I love their violin talent so much more than the other. But it could just be me. Three of the songs are epic to me, and I listen to them over and over. The rest, not so much. But that is not to say they are not wicked talented! Definitely worth the three I enjoyed!"
5,nuttin but stringz leaves you nuttin but grooved!,"I first heard Nutting But Stringz on Pandora, specifically, ""Thunder"" which is track #3. It was so awesome, I noted it and then ordered it here on Amazon. These two brothers are violin virtuosos; add to this a ""street beat"" and you have something you've not heard before! Whether you like hip-hop or classical music, you will enjoy this!!"
4,Thanks for Stringing us along !!!,"What a Great work of art or should I say strings!!!A co-worker shared this amazing cd with me and I just loved it!!I was compelled to order a copy for myself. I would love to share it with the students during lunch time at our school .Only If I could get certain songs copied from it, or if there were instrumental songs.I'm not much for the rappin, but when it is mixed with the strings it's a great sound.I am so very proud of these two amazing young guys stringing us along with Nuttin' But Stringz. !!The only thing that could make this cd better ,is if there were an instrumental version to some of the songs. .I wish we could get them to visit our school when they come to Houston!!!I know the children would love it and it would be great to see them string us along."
4,Everest for Re-enactors and Kids,"""Everest: Triumph and Tragedy..."" reminds me of a box of reproduction Civil-War memorabilia I was once given: it includes replicas of 1921 map, a Tibetan prayer flag, an envelope recovered from George Mallory's body in 1999, some 55 years after he died trying to climb the mountain, etc. The so-called 'artifacts' are nicely done - the envelope has Mallory's scribbles on it, and is worn along its edge - and will give the neophyte a ""you are there"" kind of thrill, like attending the re-enactment of a Civil War battle. The whole book comes to only 28 pages of text, however, so there is not much to it other than these interactive elements.Beyond this thrill the book is a serviceable introduction to the mysteries and history of Mount Everest, but it does not cover any new ground. Its interactive nature would make it an excellent choice for kids, but for adults it is for completists only. 4 stars for kids but 3 for adults."
5,Awesome,This music system is great! The sound quality is the same as our surroumd sound entertainment center. It is the cheapest yet best stereo for the price. I was looking at a 90 watt stereo. It was $90. It was on display and the sound quality was nowhere close to as good as this stereo.Dont waste your money on any stereo.
1,are you guys on crack?,"i work for radio shack (now the source by circut city) i have seen prob. 10 of these systems come in that are less than a year old all with the same problem, everything apears to be working but system puts out absolutely no sound. so if your system works whatever you do don't move it!!! that seams to be the similarity between all customers having this problem. the system is garbage if you want to listen to your sterio for a wile without haveing to treat it like glass spring a couple extra dollars. after all you get what you pay for."
2,What good is a stereo that produces no sound? It can still tell time!,"I bought this stereo model 1 1/2 years ago, and the speakers recently quit on me. I'm in the Army, and, as being in the Army goes, I move around alot. The system was working fine for me in Arizona where I first bought it. Then, I had to move to Korea, and the speakers worked well for the first 6 or 7 months, but afterwards they started to work intermittently. Next, I had to move to Texas, where the speakers worked for about a month. Now, no sound comes out. I think that there is something to the hypothesis that the system is extremely sensitive to movement. The sound quality is great, if you can actually get something out of the speakers."
2,Stopped Working :( - 11 2/3 year old,"I got this stereo for Christmas last year. Sadly, the speakers quit on me within a few months. RCA's brand quality is about Middle to Low. I like its features and sound quality, but the brand is probably the issue. Of course, I've only had one of these, so I don't really know how many stars to give it. It could of just been defected. But whatever - if you're planning on buying a stereo, I'd go for Sony, Panasonic, Toshiba, Pioneer, or some other inexpensive but quality designed unit."
2,NO SOUND,"I bought one for My Mom and it worked for about 5 uses. And she barely used it at all, and one day we turned it on to silence. Volume at full blast I could hear the aux signal very faintly and full blast hum. Now that I've seen other folks with the same issue I kind of want a replacement!! But I'm sure the warranty is long expired. I think I spent over a hundred on this piece of work- They most likely skimped on the preamps or something.... Bad Product."
1,not worth the brass its made of,It took me and 8 other guys at camp to get it to work! When it did work the batteries lasted about 5 minutes. Since u only have a limited time on the batteries by the time u make any adjustments its dead. Very very disappointed!
2,Fire Extinguisher does not match the picture,"The fire extinguisher I received does not match the picture. I purchased this product because of the compact handle and trigger shown in the picture. What I got is a regular looking fire extinguisher that I could have gotten cheaper at any home improvement store, and I wouldn't have had to pay for shipping.When I saw the fire extinguisher in the picture I almost ordered half a dozen for my extended family. Thankfully I only ordered one."
3,"She can not sing or dance, but boy is she sexy!!!!","It is true that her singing leaves much to be desired and her latin dance moves are stiff, not flowing, but WOW is she sexy or what. The only reason I watch the video is to see her."
2,JENNIFER BETTER AS AN ACTRESS,I REALLY WASN'T IMPRESSED WITH HER MUSIC . THE ONLY PART I LIKED WAS THE LATIN DANCE . I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH SINGERS THAT SING LIKE THAT . I WISHED SHE WOULD HAVE APPRAOCHED IT A DIFFERENT WAY. MORE LIKE CUBIA OR SALSADONT GET ME WRONG I DO LIKE JENNIFER LOPEZ AS A ACTOR I THINK SHE LOOKED BETTER THAN THE REAL SELENA.
4,She has it going on all the way.,"The single is wonderful, really the whole album is very creative and wonderful listen music."
2,"Good song, shame about the singer","I have to say that I think the song itself is catchy and it stayed in my mind, but Jennifer's vocals did not. Being on the big screen does not automatically mean an ability to sing (not that she can act, but that's another matter). I have to big up the songwriters, but I can't do the same for Jennifer. Her looks are also overhyped, and they shouldn't be the reason people buy her Cds. It's a shame; someone far more talented could have done it justice."
2,Hard to keep hold of; not color fast,"I have this set, but in different colors. For mine, the 3 pound pair are green, the 5 pound pair are orange and the 8 pound pair are purple. When I workout, I sweat. When I sweat, the coating on these gets slick and I worry about dropping them. Also, the color on the purple pair bleeds; I realized this after I stacked them one on top of the other and the orange pair ended up covered with purple polka dots - which cannot be cleaned off. If I had it to do over again, I think I'd just buy plain old hex dumbbells. I wouldn't buy these again."
3,marginally adequate,"I got the whole set and put them on a 2000 V10 Excursion. Front V code (f350) springs, rear springs stock with 5"" blocks. This setup is more than these shocks can handle. hey do not control the spring occilations. For a factory soft excursion spring with no lift they may be fine, but they are too weak for my set up."
5,Great book,Everyone in my seniors book club loved A Long Way From Chicago. It's funny and entertaining and I passed it on to my granddaughters.
3,it was o.k,"a long way from chicago was a great book, I would recomend it. I realy liked this book it was a good book for kids to read.It was exciting"
4,A Long Way From Chicago,"This Boook to me was a great book to read. I loved this book because it had that personality to it that set the whole book . In it ,it also gave some advice about U.S. history, about Abraham Lincoln and his wife about some antiques of thiers.And it gave advice to spend more time with your family . It told you be creative with what you are doing and give it your best shot.I think Rchard Peck is a fantastic writer and god bless him he's still writing and he's sixty eight years old.I think his books catch everyones attention if there six or eleven years of age. I think the morals to all of his books is to enjoy life and live to the fullest of your life!"
5,Much enjoyed by and adult reluctant reader,"I got this as a gift for an older relative who is not a big reader. He loved it (and all of Peck's other books as well), and it has turned him into an eager reader."
4,Independent Reading Review,"Dear Amazon,The book, A Long Way from Chicago, by Richard Peck, is a fantastic novel for people that just want to have fun reading.The three main characters, Grandma Dowdel, Mary-Alice, and Joey each have their own virtues that stick out in my mind. Grandma's stretching of the truth makes her two grandchildren doubt how safe they really are with her. When a local gets killed many townspeople tell of old time stories of how ""Shotgun Cheatham"" god his name. Grandma Dowdel wants to settle the mystery of this man and let him rest in peace so she dicides to hold a wake at her house. During this time some wild things occur which could drive any reader to keep turning this books pages. The target audience for this book is more for young teens and kids to read, becuase the way the characters act in certain positions they are put in. I would recommend this novel, I definitely enjoyed it!"
4,Great!,"I really enjoy this book. It's really a good book. I cried at the end.(Hey I'm sensitive) Funny here and there. I only gave it a 4 star because I thought it was missing something. I can't explain it, but it's just missing something."
2,it was ok,"Trey Moore-I didn't like this book because it was not my type of book. I do not like to read any fictional books. This book just bored me. I give it 2 stars.Drew Thigpen-If you like mysterious,suspenseful, and fun books, you will like reading this book. i Like this book because it has a good plot. This book is very fun to read and makes you laugh."
2,A girl and a boy find life on a farm can be fun.,"A girl and a boy learn how important it is to make your own fun.They go to there grandma's house every summer.Each year they go it gets more fun.The first few summers though were not so fun because there was not much to do but work.After a while they started finding things to do.One thing they liked to do was go to the coffee shop in talk.Another favorite activity was when grandma started taking them to lots of different places, such as fairs,picnics,fishing. When grandma brought them places like that they were lucky.So I think it was an okay story.But it could have been better if there was more action and purpose to the book."
3,average,I didn't like the book as much as the rest of my class. I thought it was hard to understand sometimes. It takes place a long time ago so maybe I'll like it when I'm older.
5,A long way from modern life,"I really enjoyed the characters in this book, especially the feisty and crusty grandmother in this depression era tale. She sort of reminded me of some outrageous old ladies I have known. It is a short book, and each chapter covers a summer visit of Joey and Mary Alice Dowdel with their Grandma Dowdel in her very small town.I found these stories to be engaging, and some to be laugh out loud funny. I was surprised to find the very end to be somewhat poignant. I later read this one out loud to my kids for some family entertainment, and it was hit."
4,not a long way from our hearts,"Everyone has known somebody, that through the course of years, has gotten more interesting, and Joey's Grandma Dowdel is no exception. In these fun loving, turn-of-event vignettes Joey's memory shades the truth or serves him too well as we come to know the unforgettable Grandma Dowdel. From pie baking to rifle-toteing she always proves that the underdog can have the last word, and eat it too! Ages 12 and up will enjoy this Newberry Honors book and it's annual antics in an illinois small town during the depression, and laugh out loud at each twist and turn that happened a long way from chicago, but not a long way from our hearts."
5,A Long Way From Chicago,"This book and it's sequel ""A Year Down Yonder"" are two of the most delightful books I have read in a long time. It is the story of two children from Chicago who spent time each summer with their grandmother, Grandma Dowdle, in the country. Their adventures are exciting and funny but each teaches a unique principle. I laughed a lot reading this book. Now as I go through my day-to-day life, I quite often think of Grandma Dowdle and the lessons I learned from her. This is a book written for adolescents but as an adult, I loved it."
3,7th Period,"Aidan Falchook-This book is suitable for ages eight and up. If you read and liked the book ""A Year Down Yonder,"" you will like this book. In my opinion this book is o.k., it could use more detail in the chapters. I liked Grandma Dowdel the most in the book because she was very unexpected. I didn't know what she was going to say next."
5,A great book,"This book, A Long Way From Chicago, has three main characters. Joey, Mary Alice, and Grandma Dowdel. I liked this book a lot. This book is about two kids, Joey and Mary Alice going to their grandma's house for one week in August. Each chapter takes place in a different year. Also, the kids are getting older and older in every chapter. That is one of the reasons why I like this book so much.One of my favorite parts is when the Cowgills try to get into grandma's house and steal her husband's shotgun. Also, when the two old men fought in the street, at the parade, in grandma's town. And when Joey and Mary Alice wore grandma and grandpa Dowdel's wedding clothes.I would give this book a 5 out of 5 stars. I would recommend this book to someone who loves to read. Also, to someone who loves adventure in a story."
4,A Long Way From Chicago,A Long Way From Chicago is a great book for all ages. This book is one of the greatest books that I have ever read. This book is about a brother and a sister who spend their summer in a small town that has a lot of odd things happining every time they come. The book is a giant cliffhanger in every chapter.
5,Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was an awesome book that talks about the adventures 2 kids have with their adventurous Grandma. I loved this book so much that I read it twice. In the story, Grandma is not an average Grandma at all. She lies and cheats in about every chapter. I recomend that you read this book."
5,Thrilling adventure,"I thought that ""A Long Way from Chicago"" was a very good book. It had funny parts, yet it also had a very good meaning. I thought the meaning was to say that everyone has weird realatives but you grow to love them. Becuase in the beginning of the book Joey and Mary Alice didnt want to go, but in the end they really loved it. I think that everyone should read it, old or young."
5,A long way from chicago,this was one of the best books i've ever read! i like the fact that this book was full of action. and grandma dowdel always seems to know what will happen. a must read!!
4,A Long Way From Chicago,"This book is about two kids that live in Chicago. They go to visit their grand mother that lives in a little town in Illinois for one week once a year. Some wild thing happens every time and they always seem to be put in the middle of it. What I learned from this book is that everyone thinks that grandma Dowel is a mean and evil woman. Grandma Dowel is just trying to help people in her own way.I loved the book because the author made you feel like you're in the book. I could actually imagine Shotgun Cheatham rising up out of his casket. It was funny imagining the plane trying to rise off of the ground with grandma in it. Grandma is an old fashion type of person. If she wants something she will get it.Mary Alice and Joey are brother and sister. They are very different people. Mary Alice not afraid of many things, but on the other hand Joey is afraid of everything. This book is shortened from 10 years to 148 pages. If you really enjoy reading books."
3,Not as good as I expected it to be,Well i would just like to say that i dont think you should read this book because it was hard to get into and once i finished it was just kind of dull and i was glad to be done
5,Getting boys to read,"All four of my sons, ages 12, 10, 8 and 6, enjoyed this book. It is so difficult to find good books which children will read and enjoy - this is one of those books. The story is a tender portrayal of the relationship between two children and their grandmother, with enough irreverence thrown in to keep the kids interested. Read this aloud to your kids."
5,two thumbs up,"kita/clay reviewThe book A Long Way from Chicago was and still is a great book for the teens or for anybody that likes a funny, serious, book that will get you thinking. The book is a fun filled novel with characters that fit almost everybody(some mean, some caring, some just plain out jelous, and some that are going to tell you the truth no matter how bad it hurts you.) I loved the way the auther gets so into what the characters say and all the characters seem to say the right stuff at the right time. Over all the book was the most fun filled, ation, and even a little romance I have ever read. I recomend this book i promise you will LLLOOOVVVEEEEEEEE it . Just read the book"
3,A Good Book to Read,"A Long Way from Chicago is one of Richard Peck`s novels.It is a story of two children,a brother & sister, who were visiting their Grandma Dowdel in an Illinois town. And that probably was between 1929-1942. At all these years the children have many strange adventures such as having steal property , helping Grandma fault , the dead man in the coffin ,and catching the sheriff in his underwear. This book contains many interesting parts . For example, ""The Mouse in the Milk"" , ""Things with Wings"" , and ""Shotgun Cheatham`s"" which I liked the most . It has a special atmosphere , when I read it first I was confused but then everything become clear.Generally , A Long Way from Chicago is a good book because it is rich with new vocabulary words for whom interested learning English also it is a comedy and has many funny stories . I recommed reading this book for it`s interest and value."
2,A Long Way from Chicago,"A Long Way From Chicago is a collection of short stories from the point of view of a child when he visits his grandmother in chicago. My opinion of this book is that it was sort of slow. It was fairly funny, but not the kind of hysterical funny, or even silly funny (like Roald Dahl's books- I reccommend them!). I found this book hard to get into, and overall a heavyweight to finish. A couple of the short stories were funny, but overall I wouldn't reccomend this to many people."
4,a Good Book,"In A Long Way From Chicago, you will read about a kid named Joey, who tells the story. Then you'll read about Mary Alice, who becomes more like Grandma every year. Then there's Grandma. Grandma is different.You'll read about explosives, cherry bombs, and more.Every August, Joey and Mary Alice go and visit Grandma. They go for 1 week. They get older every year. As the years go by, Joey starts to figure things out, but not everything. He never knows what Grandma or Mary Alice are thinking.My favorite part is in chapter 7, Centinel Summer. In Centinel Summer, Grandma is mad at this woman for asking her to do something she does not want to do. So, Grandma starts thinking. On the day of the parade, Grandma beats the woman in the 2 competitions she really wants to win.I give this book an eight out of ten stars, because it was a good book, but not the best. I recommend this book to anyone that likes adventure."
1,A Long Way from a good Plot,"Call me Old fashioned, by I like books with a plot. This book is soo boring. I had to read it for school and it was tourtur! Unless you are like 70 and up, NEVER READ THIS DUMB BOOK. Also, it didn't have a real plot. It was like reading a badly written diary. I would rather see paint dry for 3 hours! If you wanna read a book about the war days, read Anne Frank's Diary and Save the BORDOM! And it does not even deserve 1 star!"
2,A Novel For Bored Poeple,"The novel was ok . It wasn't the best book i read,but it still caught my attention.Because of the events that took place in ever chapter.The chapters were funny ,weird and some where even seriouse.The chapters kept me reading for more hopeing the next chapter was just as interesting as the last . the book is not for people that want a action pack book ."
1,Didn't Even Finish This Bad Book,"For read aloud my teacher read this but we changed to a different book because it was so boring and you could,nt even understand what was going on in the chapter book. So don't ever begin to read this story because it would take time away from books that are good."
3,industrial-techno hilarity,"this kind of stuff always makes me laugh... old-school industrial-rock that is hard-hitting and tough-sounding. but with song titles like ""Rat Skin"" and those growly vocals, you just can't help but supress a giggle as you rock out. these guys sound a lot like the Young Gods in their heyday (late 80's, early 90's), and in fact, this CD is from '92, around the same time as the first NIN album... but this one is less poppy and stays true to it's Wax Trax industrial roots."
2,Broke!,Broke very easily after a couple of classes! Just didn't hold up under the pressure of petite allegro. He he.
3,OK but not stand alone,"Its a bit dated, but there is not much info out there on the polish opening and many databases are limited on it as well. Im the type of player that like to play unorthodox openings so this one fit the picture. The book is ok not written very well nor does it explain the positions. I gave it a three bc there really is nothing else out there, and the only way to get the most of this book is to run it with one of yor chess engines and have the engine analayze ot for you and read the analyses. So as a tool with a computer programs its ok, as standalone its bad."
5,AWESOME,"After reading reviews and searching for how to get the dark ring off our old toilets... this thing did the trick! referred it to my mom, and she loves it too. I like the handle, so i dont have to get my hand dirty. this rocks!"
1,A bust,Did not work as advertised - actually it was worthless when it came to cleaning tile around a whirlpool which is exactly what it promised to do
4,"Shorter pumice piece would work better & not break, use precautions, and be careful not to scratch/damage the porcelain bowl.","I agree. This pumice stone works pretty well, much better than chemicals and toilet brushes. HOWEVER..... First, wear latex or rubber gloves when you work in a toilet bowl, and add some bleach (it doesn't take very much to sanitize the toilet bowl water). I drained the toilet bowl water by turning the valve off, flushed, then poured my bucket of detergent in water into the bowl. My ""pumice stick"" broke in two when I first started using it. I believe it's too long to be totally useful. I used the broken 1/2 and was able to scrub the rings. I also used liquid Spic & Span in water, with some bleach, to help the cleaning. I do think you can find cheaper pumice stones, smaller, shorter, that might even work better. Be careful with how hard you scrub, as well. This is a very abrasive stone, no need to scratch/damage the porcelain bowl any more than necessary."
1,Too rough,"I expected this product to be a little softer, so it would mold to the bowl after just a few uses. But it really is as hard as a rock, making the flat surfaces useless against a round bowl."
5,no ring now,"this item works wonders for toilets with a hard water ring, did not appear to scratch surface of porcelain toilet bowl"
5,Best ring remover I've been able to find,This is a well designed and well made toilet ring remover. I've had other ring removers break on me but the Pumie has held up very well. The price is fair also.
4,Pumie Toilet Bowl Ring Remover,"The material was a little more pourous than previous stick scrubbers, but that may be due to wanting to preserve the porcelon and not scratch it. It works fine."
1,Pumie review,Pumie did not remove the ring in toilet. Very unhappy with product. Product was a waste of time and money.
4,AMAZING.,"Absolutely love how easily it takes off the ring around the toilet! I clean and scrub with every product you can imagine and still, not clean!!!! This was a less than 5 minute fix. Pretty sure I'm addicted."
5,Awesome!!,This worked awesome!!! We had bad rings in our toilets and nothing has ever worked untilI got pumie!! Hilghly recommend!!
3,Not safe for colored porcelain,"One of our bathroom, a throwback to the previous owner, is black. No accounting for bad taste right.Anyway, this pumice scratched the black surface leaving visible white marks. Where once we had calcium buildup we now have a scratched surface. Hardly the results we were looking for.I would not recommend you use this on any bolder or darker colored toilet bowls.Cant wait to replace this bathroom..."
3,Unfortunately I did not get the same great results,"My toilet does not look brand new or even close to it after using this product. Also, it wears out FAST and I feel like it is over priced."
5,love it,This is so easy to use. You don't have to get your hands wet and it takes off the toughest rings in the toilet. It won't even scratch the porcelan.
5,It really does work!,"After trying pretty much everything else to get hard water stains off our toilets, I had pretty much given up until stumbling on the Pumie. Decided to order after reading the other positive reviews, and it really does work. Takes a bit of ""elbow grease"" but the stains are now gone from the toilet bowls. Would definitely recommend this product."
2,Pumice Scratches Toilet Bowl Making Subsequent Cleanings Difficult,"I haven't used this specific product but I have used pumice to clean my porcelain toilet bowl. It was great for the first two cleanings, then slowing--as the porcelain became more and more scratched from subsequent cleanings--the pumice became less and less effective. I am still searching for a long term solution."
1,Worked but broke,This worked but broke in half the first time I used it. Great idea but a very badly constructed product.
3,"Good product and works well, BUT ...","Pumice stones are excellent for removing rust stains and hard water deposits on variety of surfaces including toilets, bathtubs and sinks. They are even good to remove callouses on your feet. This product works as advertised and works very well. However you can save a lot if you buy the regular pumice stone from same company at less than half the price, and here on Amazon and Prime eligible.U. S. Pumice HDW-12 Pumie Scouring StickUnless you are squeamish about getting your hand in the toilet bowl it works just as well, better maybe as you can control the stone better without the handle and can use full stone not just part down to where handle insert goes into the stone. You are going to put your hand in toilet bowl anyway even with the handle, why not save several dollars?"
4,Pumie works where nothing else does,"This is a great product.It took off hard water stains, that simply no other product before it did.The Pumie does wear down pretty quickly when used.A plus is that it functions well even when used down to the very hilt.A minus is the cost versus how long it lasts (I got through 2 of these in about 45 minutes), but they did work!At ten bucks versus its lifespan, this knocks it down a little to 4 stars.I think the Pumie is great, and highly recommend it."
4,Does the trick,The municipal water in my area is very hard so I eventually get the dreaded ring around the toilet at the water line. A pumice stone is a quick and easy way to remove the hard water ring without damaging the porcelain. Highly recommended product.
1,not the answer!,"i thought this would be the answer to my horrible problem of my cats tracking litter all over the floor in my apartment. boy was i wrong! my cats HATE this product. they will jump over it to go into the litter box and jump over it to get out of the litter box. i think they don't like bristly texture of the pad. they completely avoid it! to make things worse, because of the way they're avoiding it, i'm getting more litter on the ground than before."
4,the solid introduction.,"I first read a friend's copy of this book, which he had used as a text in a psychopharmacology course. i soon acquired my own copy, and a number of my friends have read it--it's a very accessible introduction to mind-affecting drugs, with generally good pointers into more specific literature. Julien's strengths are in the area of legitimate, prescription use; i feel that the recreational sections are somewhat less complete. the chapter on psychedelics is, unfortunately, nigh-on-useless--errors and omissions here mar an otherwise excellent book. this book has been an indespensible reference for me."
3,Me gusta GRUPO MOJADO,"""CALDO DE POLLO"" fue de las primeras canciones que escuche de MOJADO,, Era todo un exito en la discoteca de moda., y desde ahi me converti en fan de su musica, tiene ritmos para todos los gustos.I like GRUPO MOJADO.""CALDO DE POLLO"", was one of the first songs I listened from this band, it was a LATIN night club hit, from there on, I become a fan from its music."
5,LOVE IT!,"So cute, one of the cutest slipcovers I have found so far.On the back is a purple gingham pattern that they don't show here.So it's kind of like getting two slipcovers in one!"
1,CHEAPLY MADE,I bought this slipcover after reading the reviews...and I am very disappointed with it...the material is very thin and the zipper has totally ripped off...and no it was not abused in anyway...unless taking it off every once and a while to wash it is abuse? I would have given it no stars but the Amazon page wouldn't let me.
3,"Decent watch, but not quite as advertized","I've been wearing the watch for about a month now, and it does work very well. A couple of notes aren't well disclosed, however:- When I bought the watch, I assumed it was an all-metal construction, the pictures make it look like the bezel and the band are both stainless steel. In fact, the band is stainless, but the bezel is a somewhat cheap-looking chromed plastic. Not quite what I had in mind, but you get what you pay for.- It is far too easy to switch into and out of daylight savings mode - Just holding down one of the buttons for a little over a second switches between them and automatically takes an hour off (or puts one back on) your time...This freaked me out a couple of times until I figured out what was happening.Overall, a pretty good watch, but it isn't necessarily exactly what it looks."
2,Good but not quite up to par,"Had mine for two years and then the battery failed. During that time had a minor glitch and attempted to contact Casio. Forget it. There is absolutely no customer support. I should have expected it for a $25 watch, but even if you attempt to get information on any watch they sell, they don't respond. No web support, no email, and no phone call support. So make sure you can live with what you buy. I agree with other users that for those of us 40+, the display is hard to read. I've given up entering data into it. Alternate (world) time is ok, but does NOT sync with actual time (i.e. you have to make sure the minutes are correct on your own). It is very, very easy to accidental set (or remove) DST, and the display will not let you know. Same thing if you like 24-hour time. Overall, a very basic watch that is capable but has many minor flaws, the biggest which is that the battery does not last."
3,Good value for money,This watch does exactly as promised. Nothing more nothing less.Not exclisive and I suspect the case to be some kind of plastic not steel as stated.
2,really cheap looking,"This watch looks like it was a toy received in a Happy meal. I know it's cheap but others in this price range look much better. On the plus side, it has all the functions that I need. I returned it and purchased a different Casio model."
3,Mr,"I have owned 3 Casio Databank watches. Specifically, the e-databank with 150 memory locations where I could store my wife and kids personal info, bank#'s and pins, Investment account#'s and pins, etc. But, alas I am now being downgraded to the Databank DB36(0)-1AV with only 30 memory slots. I have only viewed a picture and, a technical write up of it but it appears to have a password protect function also. If I cannot find another EDB-610 soon I'll be purchasing several of these Databank DB36(0)-1AV as Casio has decided to discontinue the Databank line. Boo Hoo ... And, my EDB-610 watch was the best design I had ever used extensively, and more memory protected infromation than my smart phone could do. Case and point, cell phones can be stolen, dropped, misplaced and, destroyed but rarely your watch."
5,mens watch,I have been looking for the right watch for months. I needed one that has several alarms. The only thing I don't like about this watch is the clip band. I have already exchanged it out and put on a flex band.
4,Casio Men's Digital Databank Watch #DB360-1AV,"New Casio Men's Digital Databank Watch #DB360-1AVSimple, easy-to-use, 10 year battery, metal band, illuminated display.A great deal for less than $25.00.The ShopEmco merchant shipped fast; product received was as expected.NOTE: One common problem with many CASIO watches however is that the pin-holes in the casing for the wrist-watch band can break away."
4,Numbers too small in phone book!,"Nice looking watch , but the storage for phone numbers is too small in the size of the numbers. My old Timex was much better in that area..."
2,Keeps Blanking Out,"Unreliable, display keeps blanking out from time to time. When that happened, you have to unscrew the cover and touch the two terminals to reset it. So it's pretty much useless as a databank. I almost lost several phone numbers when it happened the first time.I like the features especially the count down timer. If only the watch could stay on."
1,Worst watch I've ever bought,"My old Casio lasted over 10 years. This one didn't last 10 weeks. From the beginning, it was apparent that this was a cheaply made watch. The metal wrist band clasp failed 3 times, causing the watch to come loose. I should have returned it then for a refund. A few weeks later, the battery failed. After contacting Amazon, they informed me the period for getting a refund had expired --- two days earlier. The seller, Watchtronics, wouldn't help either. So now the only alternative is getting Casio to fix or replace the piece of junk. No thanks. I 'll take the $20 loss and get another brand watch. Don 't be fooled like I was --- Casio watches are not what they used to be!"
4,Very good.,The watch was all that I expected except to the alarm volumn is to low I could be twice as loud.
3,Not the Clasp pictured/described,"The clasp on this watch is nothing like the description. The clasp is in 2 pieces and will fall off the wrist if not attached correctly. Differences from older DB-34H: screen harder to read (numbers not as bold), yyyy/mm/dd are much much smaller (older person wouln't be able to read) and underneath the time instead of at top; buttons on right side have different functions (top and bottom reversed), setting alarm is not the same.Gave a 3 rating because of the clasp and difficulty in reading watch. However, still like the functions in the DataBank."
4,SL30 to replace the Siemens 4200 Series Handset,"I purchased the SL30 two reasons .. 1) because it's fully compatible with my Siemens 2415 GigaVoice system AND 2) It has provisions for an earpiece/mike attachment. I'm keeping the 4200 Handsets for the rest of my home, but for my personal use when I must handle a LOT of telecons I use the SL30. It works quite well. It's a bit small for my hands as are most other cell phones but it's GREAT for the reasons I mentioned. It's about 1/2 the size of the 4200 series but it's sound remains pretty good; not quite as good as the 4200 but quite acceptable. So if you have the 4215 Series wireless AND you want the capability of earpiece/mike operations. BUY IT!"
4,Great for nail polish,"I use it for nail art & it works great. Hard to clean up, but still does the job. Thanks"
2,"Okay, but there are better Baby Sign DVDs","I bought this when I was pregnant with my first child, who is now 18 months old.It is okay, but doesn't hold my child's interest like a differnt series of Sign DVDs does. Signing Time is faster paced, and much more entertaining to both me and my son than this one. If you're looking for a Sign DVD, I'd check out the Signing Time series over this one."
4,the ipod is not the only option,I have used a lot of different devices to play my digital music collecton and as a mac user all i see is ipod ipod ipod and more ipod well i got fed up with the ipod i had and i deceided to get something a little bit different I saw this player and after hearing about is RIDICULOUS battery life i deceided to give it a try well ive been useing it a little while on my ibook and it works pretty good while it cant play my drm protected files i dont have that many so thats no huge loss to me its just a simple drag and drop action which can get combursome but is not to bad throw in a radio and even some live on the fly recording and this player is a fantastic value for the money at only one twenty for the two gig version its cheaper than a nano and it feels a lot more sturdy so even if you are a mac user consider somthing beside the ipod it may work for you
2,32X Search - Not Podcast Ready,"This player has some nice features for playing music tracks, but if you use your mp3 player for long podcasts (most of mine are 2 to 5 hours long), don't consider this player.The maximum search speed is only 32X (per the user manual). It would take more than 9 minutes to search a 5 hour podcast.In contrast, the Apple Nano maximum search speed is not constant and accelerates to about 4000X, so it takes about 5 seconds to search a 5 hour podcast. The Apple Nano is ideal for long podcasts."
2,I don't understand the other reviews....,"On the outside the book is large and gorgeous with a glossy dust jacket. Open the cover and the the inside color matches Lady Agnew's sash! Turn another page and -inferior quality paper. The colors of the reproductions are dull. TONS of black and white photographs. In some sections, pages and pages of just black and white photographs. By the large size of the book, I thought I would get to see large pictures. Not so, except for Chapter introductions where a close up of a detail might be featured, elsewhere there are sometimes 3-4 tiny pictures squeezed onto the same page. Too small (and some in black and white) to appreciate any of them. I was VERY disappointed and am going to return it. I have three other books on Sargent and the quality is just so much better than this one."
2,Not for people who buy art books for the images,"Very disappointing for me. Half of the images are black and white (its 2012, come on!), most of them are kind of blurry and the bright parts often burn out to white, like it had been contrasted to compensate for the lack of crispness. It might well contain some good writing, but that is not the reason I spend money on art books."
3,12v electric car jack,I used this jack to lift up the SnowSport HD snow blade (about 120 lbs) installed on my 2000 GMC Jimmy front mount. Very easy to install with 3 u-shape bolts and chain. It works fine but takes about 2 minutes to go all the way up. Its OK if you lift only to drive for gas.
1,Do not waste your money on this jack,Bought 2 of these jacks to do tire rotation on my cars. First one failed (it actually collasped) on the third use. Second on lasted a little longer and failed when the screw threads stripped. These things are junk and unsafe. Avoid.
2,Electric car jack,"Not powerful enough. We gave it to someone with a smaller vehicle. Kept the flashlight, though.It's handy."
4,Sanding center,"The sander is well made and works very well. It takes two people to unpack, it's very heavy, my wife and I struggled with getting it on the work table. It was missing one part, but the 800# worked great,had the part in two days. The sander needs a sturdy table, I got one from Rockler with casters so I can move it out of the way when not in use. Dust pickup works well and speed control is nice. This one machine really dose give you three very versital machines. Gambier, Ohio"
3,So-so Palmgren sander....,"The machine came with absolutely no paper work of anykind. Perhaps they have not translated it yet fromthe Chinese language. There is no instructions,no assembly drawings etc.. NOTHING. The machine is heavycast iron which is nice, including the tablesIt is the typical rough-Chinese castings withpaint job that looks good from a distance.I have since discovered that the machine in otherpaint scheme is also sold by Sears..so if you want oneyou may be able to get it cheaper at a Searsnear you if you watch the sales flyers. Plusit is pretty easy to return stuff to them.The three different sanding devices are handyas is the speed control... I would recommend thatyou see it, up close and in use before you plunk downyour money."
4,Good Quality and Updated,"Really nice, accurated, updated and good looking. Perhaps colors could be in better contrast."
5,A book for new and old managers alike,"Mr. Grote tells it like it is, and I loved his approach in this book. It's presented in a question & answer format where he presents a question that is just about everyone's mind who conducts performance appraisals for employees, and he answers it with a short answer then a longer and more detailed answer. The best line is when he says, ""Supervisors put up with too much [stuff]otherwise writes very well and straightforward, and strongly pushed the responsibility for improvement back to the employee, not the manager. Thank you for liberating me! He spends a good deal of the book on performance planning as well, an often underutilized tool to set an employee up for success."
3,Basic work out,"This is a great dvd for an exercise dvd,..play it and do the work out exercises along with Chinen Sensei as he demos,.... if you are from Chinen Sensei's lineage you will enjoy, if not, save your money and purchase a different dvd from Chinen Sensei or just save your money,..."
3,another metal band with female vocalist,"I really don't know about ""doom metal"" that is written in editorial reviews, but this album is emotional and gloomy, that's for sure. Nice voice, nice melodies, nice gothic metal.The video clip is boring, but hey, you're buying an audio CD, not the video.If you like Lacuna Coil, Gathering and Flowing Tears, this CD is for you!"
1,Found it a bit improbable...,"...even for fiction. Hard to accept that someone could be so heavily into astrology, etc, in a time when people were being burned at the stake for this. Also that someone could be zapped 500 years into the future and accept the radical changes so quickly. I love time travel romances but it's easier to enjoy and accept when someone is snapped back rather than forward."
1,unsafe for infants,i bought the lamp late spring 2005 and had my baby in july. i used it right away. about 5 months into its use the glass in the star began to melt from the night light. this could have caused a fire. this is why i am giving it only one star. i am going to call babys r us and the company. i am hoping for my moneyback. i won't take another chance at having a fire start in the nursery.
3,"Cute, but glass part moves","We purchased this lamp to coordinate with our son's bedroom, but have a problem keeping the glass insert in the middle of the star from moving. Our son sees it slanted inward, and wants to poke at it. it works well, has 3 settings, but the glass moves too much."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"good product, but a little on the expensive side. have only seen a slight difference in my energy level. my memory has improved slightly also. will keep taking them to give them more time."
3,New or Used?,"While I was happy with the price of a supposed ""brand new"" camera battery and how fast I received it, I was a little disappointed that the battery package was opened and not sealed. The bottom of the package had been sliced open and the battery was not in its package when I received it. Therefore I do not know if the battery was truly ""brand new"" or used and resold."
1,Poor Quality.,The frame is sturdy but the paper/plastic lining is brittle. The thick cord is stuffed inside the lamp for shipping. It rattled around inside the lamp and chipped the lining in a number of places.
1,Not worth the money,"Don't waste your money on this one.I completed all four courses of the Pimsleur series(1, 2, 3 & Spanish Plus) and bought this one to add to my knowledge. I love the listen and repeat of the Pimsleur style. However, this tape is like a spanish teacher who invited a friend over to make a take for some friends. He jumps around from vowels to sounds to repeating words to interrupting himself with other odd thoughts thrown in between.What's worse is that he doesn't give you enough repititions to learn anything.Then, Mr. Frobose, says that if you don't get it or he is repeating to fast, just rewind the tape. If that's the case and you trying to learn in your car you, would have one hand on the stering wheel, one hand on the rewind button, and ultimately get in an accident. Don't make the same mistake as I did."
1,"10,001 English Sentences","When I bought this program, I though it was going to be nothing but sentence pattern or translation drills. At least, that's what I was hoping for.I was pretty disappointed. It was the voice of Mark Frobose explaining everything. And explaining and explaining... And then occassionally he'd ask his Spanish speaking sidekick to say something for the learner, as if he was a trained seal. And he constantly addresses you and gives you instructions. ""Ok, learner. Now say...""To make matters worse, it began at a very elementary level. He spent way too much time going over the alphabet. And instead of the pattern drills I was hoping for, it was nothing but a bad phrasebook with a lot of idle chatter.I'm not sure if I learned anything from it, but it almost brainwashed me into thinking my name was ""Learner."""
4,A necessity,"I would highly advise getting this if you are worried about your bass cracking (which you should be, especially in the winter in some places). With that being said, I would also recommend getting a humidifier for the room that your bass is in because the dampit is really only designed to work while your instrument is in its case, although it is possible to play while the dampit is in the bass. My bass hasn't cracked yet (knock on wood) so I guess it works. It's pretty easy to use and it comes with a little gauge for the humidity of your room, but that gauge is a little iffy. Basically, this is something you need if you play the bass."
5,Love this book!,"This was the one book that hooked me into scrapbooking. If only I could afford the graphic and font programs that help design some of these pages! I let a friend borrow some books to learn about scrapbooking. She brought me back every book except this one and asked if she could read it again! I like simple and uncluttered....and if you do, you will love this book."
1,More like Stark and Barren Scrapbooking,"This book was a total disappointment. This author's idea of clean and simple is a bunch of black and white photos and computer generated text. So, only make albums in 8-1/2"" x 11"" because it will fit in your average ink jet printer (page 26). And make only black and white photos so you will not have to worry about clashing or coordinating your papers, text colors or embellishments with your photos.Another annoying reflection in this book is that a large number of the photos are of the same faces over and over throughout the book. I felt like I was looking at the author's personal album, not an example of techniques. Obviously, this was not a collaborative effort using a variety of talent to appeal to the variety of scrapbookers out there. Therefore, this book is targeted only to the select few not a broad audience. I recommend you spend your money on a book that has something for more styles and tastes, rather than this narrowly focused book."
4,Design principles never go out of style,"Zielske reviews concepts like repetition, space, trapped space, type, very basic (very) color, balance, visiual triangles, repetition, type choices, a few basic photography concepts, journaling and she gets into her philosophy of designing simply. None of the topics are covered in great depth except her philosophy and journaling.The design principles apply to any style of scrapbooking. But if you are looking for examples of the principles in a different style, this may not be the book for you.But if you like simple design, and/or would like to learn some basics about how design principles work in scrapbooking, this books is worth looking at."
5,Changed the way I scrapbooked,"When I first started scrapbooking I scrapped clean and simple, my history was in graphic design (like the author) but I thought that I needed to move on. Every other scrapbooker was embracing new techniques and trends, which at the time was shabby chic. I tried it, it wasn't me. But I kept trying, then along came this book, which told me it was OK to scrap simple! That it was ok to merge my computer and scrapbook papers (hybrid). It was OK to do what *I* wanted and not be pushed into creating pages I didn't like. It helped me embrace my own style.Through this book Cathy shows us the tried and true methods of creating clean and simple magazine style layouts. By magazine style I mean they are clear and striking, graphic looking but so fresh.Loved this book, and look at it time and time again for inspiration!"
5,Accounting students need this book!,"I am an accounting student and was looking for something to help break down the Accounting concepts in a more understandable way. This book definitely does the job. It is an easy read, and doesn't go deep into accounting. No headaches here! It gives enough information and simplified examples to make understanding the topics very easy."
5,Unforgettable!,"This is a movie for people with brains....tough, gritty, makes one feel they are in the trenches with the soldiers...Peck underplays his role which makes the whole cast stand out as individuals...battle-scarred backgrounds and very human interaction....has scenes that stick in your head..one of the best!"
5,Fantastic!,"This was one of the first war movies to be realistic. It did not romanticize about war at all. Gregory Peck is superb as the salty war veteran who answers the question: ""How much are you willing to give up for nothing."" Well worth you time and money. An absolute classic. Enjoy!"
3,Faulty packaging,"The DVD was loose from the center button and when we got it in the mail, it was rattling like a piece was broken. When we opened it, I saw that it wasn't attached to the center. A couple of small scratches. We haven't played it yet, though, so I don't know if it's OK."
5,I was in 224 reg. 40th div. in that battle.Great movie.!!,"Best korean war movie ever made.Brings back many memories,good and bad"
2,More Pork Than Steak,"Nothing special, your average war film. Good tribute I suppose to those who fought their but clearly NOT my favorite G. Peck film. One thing this film clearly shows it that wars cannot be micro-managed from thousands of miles away by morons who know nothing about what's going on at the front. Vietnam also proved this. Dying pointlessly for a piece of useless dirt is insane. Also, WHY weren't air strikes called in to flatten that hill? Poor management. Ben Franklin said it best ""by failing to prepare you are preparing to fail"""
3,One Man Show,"Comment: For me, this was a one man show... staged... and plodding movie. It seemed that the movie was built around Gregory Peck's personality rather than telling a war movie. If you are a big fan of Gregory Peck... this may be a good movie for you. If you came to see a good war movie about the conflict in Korea... look elsewhere."
4,"Pork Chop Hill - ""review""","Not bad for a WWII combat movie. Slow at points, but, if you can get past the slow points the movie does make a point that war is hell."
5,PORK CHOP HILL,THIS IS A EXCELLENT DVD OF THEKOREAN CONFLICT FIVE STARS PLUS ONE OF THE BEST FOR ME I WOULD SUGGEST OTHERS TO BUY THIS DVD.
4,GOOD PERIOD PIECE,"Very intellegent treatment of would be forgotten period of Amrerican history. The budget prevented the film from being five stars, but may have saved it from telling a gritty story in too spectacular a way."
4,A sympathetic snapshot of what your teen is brooding about,"There are not many books that discuss the teenage mind -- and take teenagers seriously. This book responds to the tough questions posed by teens on such topics as homosexuality, drinking, and the fear of nuclear or ecological disaster. The author refers often and in detail to his own religious perspective and outlook on world history as he discusses teenagers, but his love and respect for teenagers is universal."
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"This DVD is nothing more than video clips of a few attractions,i.e., several of the Eiffel Tower from various angles, several of the Arc de Triomphe from various angles, etc. There is no narration or voice over to describe any of the scenes, history of attraction, background, etc. It is totally useless for tourists who wish a preview of the attractions prior to an actual visit to the city. Based on the above comments, I feel it is grossly overpriced at $99.00. Postcards would tell a better story without the redundancy."
3,aka cool clips,"This barbie styling head looks great, but is difficult to achieve the same results as the picture unless you are a professional stylist. The water does not turn the hair a consistent color and the hair extensions get very ratty, very easily. I bought this for my 4 year old daughter and my 6 year old niece. Even with supervision, it was too hard for both . My 12 year old babysitter, had alot of luck , and did some great styles, but said she is too old for it. Buy Make -up Mindy or the barbie Talking styling head if you daughter is under 8."
2,looks better from the box,I purchased this product for my 3 year old who hates to get her hair done. I thought maybe she could do the Barbies hair while I do hers. Thought it was a good idea until I took it out the box.Doll falls over when you comb. Clips are hard for little hands to use. The toy works when my daughter shows me where she wants the barets placed. Too frustrating for a 3 year old. Might be O.K. for an older child.
1,Disappointing,"My daughter played with this for about 5 minutes and then got bored. There is not much to do with it. The hair clips are very hard to use for little fingers and the ""hair paint"" did not work well. Skip this one."
2,This book stinks,"Buy the Clymer Bsa, Norton, & Triumph ""combo-manual"", it's the same price and it's huge. This book is about the size of a magazine (80 pages) and is more than duplicated in the Clymer book."
4,This payne is the best,This guide is very accurately detailed. Has almost every cheat in it. Also the guide has very good info. Bottom Line: Definetely get this guide.
4,To the MAX,"When you play Max Payne one of the first things you might notice is the way the blood splatters. It is very cool and this is where the Max Payne(TM) Official Strategy Guide comes into play. It shows you how to get the most from your weapons, whats the best way to take out the bad guys(SPLATTER), and most important when to do that MATRIX-type effect that you can only do on MAX PAYNE.Trust me with this guide you will get the max out of your MAX PAYNE. You just can't go wrong."
4,The Best Book Source - Seller,"Why are you listing your one copy of this old, console game guide, which has never been, or will be, a collector's item? $600!!! In the listing intended to be a joke? I see more and more of this when old, albeit essentially worthless, books are listed by one seller on Amazon, and scarcity is automatically equated with antique value. Unfortunately, scarcity usually means no value (thats why it was never made/can't be found). ROFLMAO.Please, post and enlighten us gamers the guide is worth $600 if its NOT a typo, I'd love to learn."
1,WRONG ITEM SENT TO ME,I can't review this item since they sent me the wrong thing. I'm still waiting for some kind of answer on this. I want to return them but have not received a postage paid label to do so.Dorothy Mauri
2,Just Alright,"This is the kind of song that you can listen to, but will not stay with you for very long. The lyrics are rather trite, and the instrumentation is just average, by the standards of Tom Morello and company. Not Audioslave's best work.And to these people complaining about Audioslave being ""mainstream:"" get over yourselves you pretentious fools! Have we forgotten that Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine were very poplular and made regular appearances on MTV in their day? Being popular does not make a band bad, and being unknown does not make a band good."
5,Many Sides to Music,"It's been difficult, to say the least, to merge the two different sounds and styles together, but it also has been interesting and at time, brilliant. I didn't feel that this song, or anything on Out of Exile matched Like a Stone or I am the Highway but OTOH it's also a completely different album. Fans of RATM have to accept that these guys have grown-up and that after his little climb on the MTV Music Awards Zak proved that his mind was jelly and these guys had to move on.Be yourself is not a pop-song and does not relate only to young teen agers, if that's what your getting then you are not listening to the verses, or you are too ignorant to understand them.I have to admit, I was disapointed with Out of Exile and Be Yourself took some time to grow on me, I personally feel Curse and Yesterday to Tomorrow are stronger tracks, still it's better than 99% of the albums released in any given year."
1,Not a real pepper spray case.,"This is actually a refillable perfume container, the kind you would find at the dollar store, that someone happens to have put pepper spray in. It comes out as light sprays just like a perfume bottle, not a steady stream like pepper spray should be. On top of that mine had leaked out all over the packaging and I got pepper spray all over my hands opening it while there was none left in the actual canister. So even if yours arrives full it may still leak when you are carrying it. Not to mention the spray would not go farther than a foot or two. Certainly not a viable self-defense weapon."
1,horrible,I got this as a gift and when i got it the container leaked everywhere and got all over my hand....stupidly enough i didnt know and rubbed my eye and now of course it burns. im not even gonna use this and risk it getting all over my purse. total waste.
2,Great Idea - Too Big!!!,"I bought this lipstick pepper spray for protection, but it is even too big to fit in my pants pocket. When I go out, I typically stuff my pockets with my ID, money, makeup compact, cell phone, and lip gloss, so I thought I could easily fit this into a spare pocket for protection at night - wrong! It is WAY too big and oversized. Otherwise, it is a good product and works well."
4,Haven't used it yet,"Bought this for my girlfriend. She hasn't had to use it yet, thankfully. However, I feel most people would not think twice if they saw this in a bad or around a car somewhere. Good purchase."
2,:(,"I'm not mad at them for trying to keep the momentum going from the first book and trying to make more money, but honestly this book is repetitive and not nearly as funny as the first."
5,"Quality pants, not too heavy or too light.","Pros:Quality construction/materialsWide waist bandCons:Might be snug if you are on the heavy sideWho should buy the medium weight uniform? Anyone looking for a nice upgrade to the cheap do balk/Gi most classes provide, but still have a light enough uniform to train in.These Century medium weight pants are a great upgrade to the semi transparent ""student"" pants. They feel heavy without being to abrasive or restricting. The elastic waist band is wide enough so it doesn't roll down down my waste as I train, but there is no flexibility in the waist size. If you are on the heavy side the uniform won't stretch over a large belly, get a slightly larger size than you need and hem the legs. High quality material and well made."
3,"Cheap in Quality, yet Easy on the Wallet","If you don't know better, these probably seem like an improvement over the cheapest karate scrubs available, but compared to quality middle-weights, these really do seem like cheap lightweights. I wanted to replace some quality middle-weights that use a drawstring with something equivalent with this type of waist band. In that regard, this type of waistband is much more comfortable than a drawstring alone. Another plus is that they have a back pocket. Their saving grace is that they only cost about $20.On the downside, as I alluded to, compared to real, quality middle-weights, these are thin, light and abrasive, being partially synthetic. They're more of a middle-ground between real middle weights and light weights. Additionally, unlike a lot of other quality pants, they lack any fastener for the pocket. So don't put anything in it if you're training (not that you should anyway).It's a ""for the money, they're decent"" thing."
4,Batteries,This is a great camera except the batteries don't last long at all. I would reccomend a AC adapter
2,Beginners only!,"Very simple camera, easy to use controls. Housing is cheaply made and digital zoom blurrs many pictures, even if used correct. After using it for 6 months, I can honestly say I would only recommend this camer for beginners to explore the digital world."
4,Nice For Taking Snapshots,"I bought this camera at Target about 3 months ago and am really impressed with the picture quality. The resolution is 1792 by 1200 pixels and looks great. The only thing i don't like about it is that it takes about 5 seconds to process the photo before you can take another one. The small screen is also terrible to see in the sun so you have to use the regular viewer. But overall, for a nice camera to take ordinary photos, its a winner."
2,No worth to buy,"I have two of this camera because it is not expensive, but regret to buy them. Reasons:1) images too dark to make it unusable in many cases.2) one of my camera has auto focusing fail after half a year rare use!3) use battery quick."
4,Cool Camera,This camera is light and compact but the pictures are blurry. I recommend it for windows Me owners.
4,First digital camera experience,"I'm a Leica and Nikon user, so I approached digital with great skepticism. However, I needed a simple camera for online imaging and this unit seemed to provide the needed features at the right price. After a week's use, I can report that this little camera is a gem. The controls are intuitive and the pictures stunning. For eBay users, the camera focuses down to a few inches and the images are pinpoint sharp. Lack of optical zoom doesn't seem to be a great disadvantage; the 2x digital zoom is adequate for most purposes and consumes less battery power. Two recommended peripherals that I purchased were a memory card and a battery recharger."
3,"Not the sharpest pics, but 2M pixel size for a cheap price.","Maybe it's got a cheap lense, but the pictures usually have uneven focus. Parts are sharp, but get a little blurry in spots toward the outside. There is no lense cover, so you need to keep it clean. The internal memory is nice if you don't want to spend the money on a compact flash card and only want to take about 15 snapshots before uploading. The USB connection and software works flawlessly with my Windows XP system. As soon as the camera is connected, it prompts to upload whatever is stored on the camera."
3,BCL,"This camera takes pictures okly... The bad things about this camera is that one; the cover or surface feels like those cheap cameras. Two: their is no personal Zoom on it. It has the 2X, but it is not that good. This is like the disposible type of camera for a digital camera. But if you are into the simple things, then this camera is ok for it's price. I think HP could have done better with this product, because my laptop, printer, desktop is a HP and those are great. I was expecting this camera to be great, but it is not. So hope this helps..."
1,Better Cameras Out There,"Was very disappointed with this camera, picture quality very bad, I have a HP C200, and it beats the 318 hands down. It also drains the batterys very quickly. Would not recommend, espically for thoses gotta have grandbaby shots. Takes bad low light shots and blurry daylight shots."
2,"Odd connections, but decent product","The input/output connections for other video devices are a bit sparse on this product (you either have to use the front panel inputs or use a coax cable to hook up a VCR), but if a clean, simple design is what you're looking for, this might be perfect for you.However, the retail price is a bit steep; check around to find the best deal."
1,window bird house,"Ours fell off the window and broke the plastic roof in less than 2 weeks. Needs more or better suction cups, perhaps similar to what came w/ my Garmin GPS. Hard to recommend this product."
4,"Pretty Cool, if it works!","I bought this for my grandmother who is homebound and loves birds. We plan to put it up in the spring, the only thing I am worried about is the directions say to mount the house way up close to the eaves; and the black-out piece (so the birds can't see you) also means you can't see the birds, unless you move the blackout plastic aside. I had imagined that it would just be like a tinted window. So those two factors may make it hard for my grandmother to enjoy, but I figure if it doesn't work for her, my two year old daughter will enjoy it."
4,"good report of match, but nothing spectacular","Pandolfini annotates practically every move of the six games of Kasparov's match loss to Deep Blue (I thought it was called ""Deeper Blue""). This is book is written at a fairly basic level. He explains a lot of basic chess terms, such as open files and pinned pieces. All told, the book is interesting for those who want a record of the event, but it's not really instructive. It's also not a great value with only 6 games, though it does provide the game scores (no annotation) of the first match which K. won.Pandolfini makes some questionable comments - such as calling K. the ""last human world champion"" - and isn't afraid to express his opinion. He thinks that Kasparov would have won if he'd only played his own game instead of trying to get cute with anti-computer moves.There's no behind-the-scenes repoortage, nor much here about the technology behind Deep Blue. I think Panda might have written it on his couch from reading the games scores in the newspaper."

5,Have Autism child(ren)?,"Thomas and friend toys are in the top 10 choice for children with autism. It helps them with their hand and eye coordination. Parents have a hard time of finding information in order to help their children - so passing news along.My son has enjoyed trains since 6 months to current. I tell his grandparents that for picking out presents - if they get a ""Thomas and Friends"" toy, it will be enjoyed and played with."
4,Thomas & Friends,"Great quality set, makes an excellent addition to my children's play table. I have since found Henrietta for sale without the set at a store"
3,A box o' trains,"Not much to report on here. If you are a collector or have one of those kids that needs all the trains, this is a good set for you. Mine just likes trains and Grandma decided a good package made sense, so this one it was.They all seem to work nicely and are in good condition. Other than that, they are what they are."
3,makes a great gift.,Works perfectly. Good quality laser. Highly visible. Aligned perfect. Looks really cool. A great stocking sutffer. Fits perfect in rifle. Highly recommend.
3,clarity?,There was no clarity or explainations on the renal diet other than the nutrient guidelines and most of the recipes were for more that 4 people. We are a family of 2 and this required me to try to modify the amounts of the recipes which meant the nutritional values were now inaccurate. I was hoping for more information regarding the renal diet.I tried several of the recipes and they were quite bland. Some had good ideas that could be expanded on. They used ingredients that I was told were now forbidden.
2,"Difficult to navigate, not enough information","I bought this book in regular size print when my mom was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. I am surprised at the number of good reviews, because I found the book difficult to navigate. I could find no information on which foods to choose and which to avoid, and the index lists many recipes alphabetically by name (""Light and Fruity Pie"" instead of Pies or Desserts). The nutritional information for each recipe is listed in a separate section instead of on the same page as the recipe. As others have stated, this book is outdated and the recipes sound boring. I have tried to look for recipes on a number of occasions, but always gave up. There must be much better books out there."
3,Dated recipes but helpful,"The recipes in this book seem a bit ""dated"" such as using margarine instead of olive oil or butter, but they certainly help patients and caregivers facing kidney failure and/or dialysis."
1,Not so great,"I don't see how this is a renal cookbook. There is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too much protein in these recipes....you would have to only eat the tiniest serving in order to be within your daily allowance of protein....it is more like a white trash recipe cookbook too....crappy, unhealthy, high fat recipes in HUGE print.Not Recommended"
1,Very depressing,Reading this book left me feeling that with my PKD (disease) that there was little to look forward to with a restricted diet.
1,not for a kidney patient,"the book is very poor for a person with kidney damage. the vega diet is very good. however. the protien intake, based on the meals in this book, is extremely to high. as a result it may good for some one that wants to eat healthy, but can only make a damaged kidny worse, and has no value for a kidny patient. i placed the book in the trash and and know i spent the money for nothing."
2,Canon S200 Bubblejet Printer,"You don't save any money using the cheaper ink tanks, vs. the costlier cartridges, as the ink tanks run out extremely fast. It prints well, but I wouldn't buy it again. It goes out of alignment and needs cleaning too often."
2,"Slow, Slow, Slow","I bought this printer mainly because of how compact it is, which was a big mistake. It is the slowest printer I have ever encountered. I print a lot of black and white text and can't believe how slow it is. I have had it for a couple of weeks and I am already shopping around for a new printer that can spit out the pages a lot faster. I wouldn't buy another one."
1,Ever tried non-standard paper? Well don't!!!,"As long as I use the standard A4 paper in portrait mode, it works fine, but then again, I often use A5 or envelopes. The printer does not complain, but it slows down my computer at a rate that makes it impossible to do any real work, so I have to write my stuff, while my program is configuret for another printer, and then change the printer right befor printing. I then only have to wait 3-5 minutes - for a single page, never dared do anythgin larger - befor the driver starts processing the job, and from there well it's slow but it does print."
5,Very good if you don't have a lof of time!,"I recommend this to anyone who wants to pray but feels there is not enough hours in the day to do so. The book title pretty much says it all. The readings are very short. I think it is an excellent book to begin out on, but if you're like me, you will begin desiring more and may need to move to a larger prayer book."
5,As a child I looked at it for hours,"I remember this book when I was a child, and the many hoursspent gazing at the pictures. Norman is a mouse who has a cool pad inthe helmet of an old armor stored in the basement of a museum. He enters an art contest sponsored by the museum and wins. When my two year old turns four, he will receive it for his birthday."
5,First Saw it on Captain Kangaroo,"I am in my early 50's and remember the magic of hearing/seeing this read on Captain Kangaroo. The beautiful watercolor illustrations made the treasures in the museum come to life. And the charming and humble Norman- a true hero. The puns are enchanting! Don Freeman captures a child's curious, obedient heart in his books. Earl the Squirrel is another of our favorites. I have 6 grandchildren and they are fans too!"
5,My favorite book of all time!,"I first heard this story in kindergarten and instantly loved it. Years later as a teacher, I would always read it to my class. We would talk about how even though the main character was little, he was still brave and followed his dreams even in the face of big obstacles. I have multiple copies and have just ordered another for my niece. Can I give it ten stars??"
3,item not as pictured,"not as pictured, wires come out of the back not the side as pictured. not happy that i had to 'modify' to pull the wires out of the side so it would fit in my fixture. item recieved was identical to what i could have bought at the local home center/hardware store black instead of gray. measures 1&1/8 x 2&1/16 x 7/8 & the 'neck' (threaded part) is just over 1 inch. this thing is HUGE, why can't these be smaller??? why is the neck so long most cases only going through sheet metal."
2,It gets a don't like because it won't play,"This is one of the old games I was unable to get to play on my pc. It sounded like an interesting game, but I can't get DOSbox to work, so was unable to play the game."
5,Bensimon,The book has a great representation of Gilles' most outstanding work throughout his career.
4,Best Ever!!!,"This has been the best fragrance for me. I'm no connoisseur, but I know what I like and also I get the best compliments when I wear this product."
4,"""Something on the side of your face, Al. No, no - the other side...""","""Frank, I gotta warn ya, she looks prettybad. No, not that bad..."" Ode to AlanNorth and Pete Lupis, whereever they are.Altough we did see Spence Mulligan laterin Chevy Chase 'Funny Farm'. First threeepisodes better than the last three. Alsobetter than Naked Gun movies with their'recycled jokes', ""Environmental theme.Zucker, Abrams, Proft went to the well toooften later. Nice while the novelty lasted!"
3,"The Naked Truth Part 2, Yankees 1","Although this is an okay tape, it is not as funny as the first. If you buy the first one and like it, consider buying this one. The name of the first tape is Police Squad: Help Wanted."
5,Fantastic!,"We really enjoyed this DVD. We especially enjoyed the interviews with Mike Pinder, but missed Ray Thomas and are still wondering what happened to him! I would highly recommend this to all Moody Blues fans."
5,A Must for Moodies Fans! A+++++,This DVD covers it all from the R&B beginnings to now. Interviews with the Moodies themselves plus all the folks that were involved with the Band past and present. Very entertaining and enlightning. Denny Laine and other members of the British music scene as well as the engaging and much-missed Mike Pinder & Ray Thomas. A real History lesson about the Band!
2,Moody Blues Classic Artist Series,"I'm with Kenneth Anselmi. My excitement upon receiving this DVD series was met with disappointment as I popped in disc 2. The audio CD was a disappointment as well. Rent it, borrow it, but don't buy it. Not enough thorough interviews with John and Justin. Mike Pinder came off as conceited and pompous. Too much of Denny Laine. No up to date information or interview with Ray Thomas was a huge disappointment too. I can't wait to go the concert in July so see the real thing!"
5,Great examples and explanations. Excellent!,"I bought this book on writing proposals at the suggestion of my literary agent who told me my proposal for my first book *really* needed help. I studied the examples in the book and the suggestions in the text and re-wrote my proposal, using what I had learned. Six weeks later, my agent called to tell me she had four offers on my book. The information here is excellent, clear, and easy to translate to suit your own book. It will stimulate your thinking about your proposal in new ways. I frequently recommend it to people in my classes and workshops who ask for advice about how to get published. ~~Joan Mazza, author of DREAM BACK YOUR LIFE; DREAMING YOUR REAL SELF; WHO'S CRAZY ANYWAY?; and 3 books in The Guided Journal Series with Writer's Digest Books."
5,"Very Nice Camera, Great Pictures, Good Features","I had an Olympus digital camera for the last three years and was very happy with it. The opportunity arose for me to get this camera (HP 715) at a great price. I was hesitant because I liked Olympus so much, but I have been won over. The HP performs very well, although it is a little heavier than my previous camera. I highly recommend this camera if you are looking for a 3+ megapixel camera!"
2,"Outdated and has poor features, and very slow to use.","Perhaps when this product first came out, it made some good impressions to those unfamiliar with digital cameras. But by now, this camera seems ancient and incompetent when compared to its competitors.Turning it on takes several long seconds, and if you want to take a picture right away, it may take even longer. From the time you press your finger down to the time that the camera actually goes off, I've frequently had to wait up until half a minute. Instant use is just not possible with this camera.The features to view stored images are very limited and poorly designed. On occasion I've accidentally deleted photos, because there is only one big button on the back that serves many functions, making it easy do something that you don't want to do.To put it simply, skip this one over and get something newer. This camera is frustrating to deal with, and not even worth the cheaper price."
1,NO TECHNICAL INFO AVAILABLE,"Since there is no technical information available, I would not touch this item with a 10 foot, make that a 20 foot pole. If specifications are not availabe, I will not buy."
4,decent but could be better,"I bought this item for a friend's child. She told me she wanted ""religious toys"" so i jumped when I saw this jesus doll. I don't regret buying it, however for $20 I was a little disapointed that it doesn't do or say anything or even come with a little book or something. The receiver of the gift also asked if it did anything and I said no, they liked it but I think maybe they were a little disapointed by that....I don't know. I would also like to point out though that the doll was a little bigger than I thought it would be, it seemed well made, and is very soft and a portion of the profit goes to charity."
3,of course Elizabeth cries...like duh!,"I usually like the fluffy and/or ridiculous SVH books. Anything with high drama and too much Steven Wakefield makes my bowels irriatable. The Golden Family has been fighting like crazy, and looks as though its splitsville for ma and pa. Good not great..in SVH terms, and if ya get this books you gotta get the next 2 cuz their like connected."
5,A few steps into a different world,"'Geisha Blues' is a delightful entree into a musical world that I will probably never experience otherwise. After reading Liza Dalby's 'Geisha' I longed for another perspective on the world I had been introduced to, and 'Geisha Blues' was not a disappointment! Although the music is quite foreign to my ears, the author provides Japanese text and English subtitles for all the songs, as well as a welcome 'visual haiku' and personal commentary for each. All those elements together make for an enjoyable time spent in another world."
3,Starts slow.,"When Viscount Drake meets Miss Truelove Becket, he mistakes her name for Truelove Beckons. For Drake, the lady's sweetness and purity of spirit do beckon. Wounded in soul from the war and his near death at Waterloo, Drake is plagued with nightmares. With Truelove he finds peace. As their friendship evolves into love, the couples' families resist. Drake's parents expect him to wed Arabella. Lady Swinley, who is Arabella's mother and Truelove's cousin, does not want Truelove to steal this prize. Truelove will seem either refreshing or unrealistically good, depending on the reader. Arabella is an interesting companion wavering between being the sweet child Truelove recalls and the simpering, scheming creature Lady Swinley has instructed her to be. The story gets off to a slow start, but the pace picks up midway through the novel."
3,"Huge tent, pretty dry, broken poles","Huge tent! 2 full size mattress in there, with room to spare.It stayed dry in the rain, except when the door was unzipped to get in, and then quite a bit poured in.Both small poles for the rain fly broke on our first (2-day) camp. Coleman sent us replacements. One had a piece break off in the metal joiner, so it was useless, and the other had a section split lengthwise, so it was a duct tape repair.We plan to use it a couple of more times this summer, & I have a feeling it's not going to last (based on the poles) -- we'll see."
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the design of the tent. Unfortunately our tent was put to the test our second night sleeping in it. We were in Zion's National Park and the rain and wind were strong but not severe. If the doors get wet, and you open them, water will cascade down the door right into the tent. We had so much water come in. I was also surprised to see water come in through the seams were the tent poles attached to the tent. We also had water pool on top of the tent. I spent probably an hour trying to work with the rain fly and guy lines to tighten up the fly to stop the pooling, but I finally gave up and put a tarp over the top. I also noticed that one of the fly poles that you see over the doors had trouble staying in place. The way the pole holder was designed just didn't seem to work. I like the huge size and ease of setup, but ended up returning the tent for a full refund."
3,Useful for business trainers,"As an ethics trainer, I have used this book for activities that might be helpful in training not only business professionals, but civic leaders and unversity students. The book has many useful exercises for businesses, but are too narrowly focused for use in the classroom or larger community venues. The book is useful for single corporate programs where people might know each other well and there is anticipated group training."
1,Not Worth The Money,I purchased this book for my college students in hopes that it would be some type of hands on activity about Ethics that would make a statement. This book was of no value to me what so ever. It was a waste of money.
3,Great message - gruesome art.,"We loved the story, but the one art page of the mice attacking and killing the birds is too gruesome for preschoolers. I would save this for grades 1-3 with a discussion of war and aggression. Not a simple story."
3,One Bird Doesn't Make a Flock,"After being abducted by a large bird, Nicholas Mouse begins an adventure in which he experiences first hand Uncle Raymond's words of wisdom: ""one bad bird doesn't make a flock."" Lionni's modern fable is an excellent tool for teaching Jane Schaeffer's techniques for writing literary analysis. The story's moral can serve as a stated thesis that students must support with textual evidence, explaining concrete details gleaned from Lionni's colorful mixed media collages that have been bolstered by their own commentary. Furthermore, students may also find meaning in changes in the characters' eyes, posture, and mouths as well as the red endpages that bear the same color as the sweet red berries which feature so prominently in the plot."
3,A Must Purchase,"This volume by Dr. Williams thoroughly fills a gap in the literature regarding what makes an arsonist ""tick."" Most texts dealing with arson and arsonists have chapters on the characteristics and traits of arsonists, but are outdated, lack currency, ignore recent research, and rely on folklore. Dr. Williams book gives fresh insite, is easily read, understood, and brings a clarity to arsonists' motives, the psychopathic personality, and other factors that no other text has achieved. It is especially useful to the fire/arson investigator, subject matter researchers, and mental health professionals working in this field."
1,Wake up Ms Pare - people care about health.,"Let's get real about slow cookers -- this author really thinks that someone owns more than one and that's just not real. There are recipes that call for a 3.5L slow cooker and others for a 5L slow cooker and others for a 6L slow cooker. Ridiculous! and nowhere could I find an explanation of how to use one size of slow cooker for different amounts of food.And the sodium/fat gram counts are way off the mark as people now learn to care about fats and sodium content, etc. The suggested use of canned foods in so many recipes makes this cook book read like a promotional handout from the packaged food industry.The fastest growing segment of the food business is organic and health foods; this book is the exact opposite of what most modern kitchens could use. I will return mine to Amazon or burn it."
1,RECALLED PRODUCT!!! DO NOT BUY,"AMO Announces Voluntary Recall of Complete MoisturePlus(tm) Multipurpose SolutionSANTA ANA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In response to information received today from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding eye infections from Acanthamoeba, a naturally occurring water-borne organism which can contribute to serious corneal infections, Advanced Medical Optics (AMO) [NYSE:EYE] is immediately and voluntarily recalling its Complete MoisturePlusTM contact lens solutions. CDC data was made available to AMO today showing that it had completed interviews with 46 patients who had developed Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) since January 2005. A total of 39 of these patients were soft contact lens wearers, 21 of whom reported using Complete MoisturePlusTM products. The CDC estimates a risk of at least seven times greater for those who used Complete MoisturePLUSTM solution versus those who did not"
2,Not as good as other eliminators,"I purchased this Wolf-Be-Gone eliminator for my 4/4 cello. I was experiencing a wolf on the D String while playing near F# in first position.While using this product, I had trouble eliminating both the wolf tone and the buzzing that the eliminator itself would cause.Next, I purchased a ""Button Cello Wolf Eliminator,"" which looked nicer, but didn't have the weight to eliminate the wolf.I then purchased the ""String Centre Wolf Eliminator for Cello"" from Amazon, and that worked much better for me.I recommend buyers skip this product and purchase a ""String Centre Wolf Eliminator for Cello."""
4,Zulu War Reference,"After years of research, Young has produced a very detailed reference work which lists an account of every engagement and battle of the Zulu War. He lists every casualty of each battle, plus estimates of Zulu losses. Many contemporary illustrations of battles & personalities, with citations of honours & awards. London 1992, Greenhill, 6 x 9, 224 pp, numerous illus."
2,"Ok, but very confusing layout","This textbook is ok, but the layout is very confusing for learning the language. It would be much better if they had laid out the different declensions in an easy-to-read chart. I know this is possible because I have seen it in ""Basics of Biblical Greek"" by Mounce. Perhaps this method is better for learning conversationally, but it is not good for learning the grammar and language structure."
2,Not for beginners...,"I will be travelling in Croatia for several weeks later this year. I took two years of college level Russian years ago (a very similar language), and completed Pimsleur's Croation CD's with little effort and no problems. I have several phrase books, but wanted a textbook to expand my vocabulary and dig deeper into the language.With all that behind me I first found myself in lesson one wondering why they chose the vocabulary they did, and then was confused by the sheer abundance of information I had to carry into the second lesson. Lesson 2 completely lost me. I found myself having trouble with the english portions explaining the grammer, let alone the Croation. So, 25 or so pages into the 380 page book I was fried.In fairness, this book was obviously not designed for self study beginners or near beginners like myself. However, the reviews that are posted here led me to believe that this would help me with my needs and it did not do that. That's why I give it 2 stars."
3,Not sure yet...,"I've had this book for about a month. I also have the companion grammar book and the audio CDs. This is my first Croatian course so I don't have anything to compare it to, and I'm still not sure how I feel about it. It's a little disorganized, in my opinion. I don't like the fact that you're given exercises without answer keys and must go to the website to download them, for one. There are way too many annotations that refer you to either the grammar book or another part of the book and you end up paging all over the place to find the reference. Maybe once I get a little more understanding of the language and a little farther into the book it will make more sense. It does seem to get pretty deep into the language so I imagine if you worked your way through this book and the grammar book you would probably be fairly comfortable with speaking or writing it. I plan to update my review once I've gotten a little farther along with this."
4,"2.3MP is all you need for great 5""x7"" photos","After being around Digital Cameras my entire high school life I decided that it was time to get one for myself. After watching my friend blow [money] on a 4MP camera that he will never use to its full potential I decited that this was the camera for me. It is realy simple to use and is a very tough camera compared to what is out there today. I only noticed two problems: 1 is that it goes through batt like water (I highly recomend a batt charger and a CF card reader), and 2 that is slows down when taking high res pictures. Other than that the CF expantion slot is nice (I have 128MB which gets 1953 low res, 277 med res, and +100 high res pictures) and I recomend it to any one who needs a good digital camera"
4,Good Digicam,"This is my first digital camera and I have found it quite nice. My friend had this camera, which is where I got the idea. I have always been into photography but have never really heard good things about digital cameras. Yet i thought this camera put out good quality photos judging from looking at my friend's camera. I went and bought it and it is outstanding. The picture quality is amazing and with 2x optical and 2x digital zoom it can get upclose. The only problem i have found is that it eats up batteries incredibly quickly. But with rechargeable batteries i have so much fun with this camera."
4,It's a Good Choice,"This is a good quality camera and is extremely easy to use. It is easy to follow the display indicators as they are similar to what most people would be used to in a non-digital camers. Focusing is simple; viewing pictures on the LCD display is simple; deleting unwanted pictures from memory is easy. The easiest part is uploading pictures to your PC--the software installs itself, and the pictures can be set to upload automatically if the camera is turned on when attached to the USB port on your PC. The camera comes with a set of alkaline batteries, a wrist strap and a USB cable. It is hard on batteries if you use the LCD display a lot, so purchasing a set of rechargeable batteries and a charger is a good idea. (As an aside, I purchased a set of rechargeable batteries made specifically for digital cameras. They are more expensive but worth it)."
4,excellent for the $$$$,"camera takes nice pix, wait for the ready, and the pix will be great, jump the shot and it comes out dark. connection to the pc is a snap. this camera is just like the 318 except it has 2x optical zoom.for the money and a 1 year warranty from hp. its a good buy.batteries, it eats batteries!!!!!!!"
1,HATE IT,"Very sensitive to light. This camera has a mind of its own and you never know if you are going to get the shot. If you are outside it is to bright and you get a white picture, inside it is to dark. I have adjusted it and have seen other reviews that say the same. I am in the market for a new camera and it won't be HP!"
4,for the money can't beat it,"nice camera, nice pixproblem, must hold camera still, better outdoors then indoorseat batteries!!!!!!good news nice pix, great price, great software, works well with win 2k and win xp.overall a good camera!!"
2,HP 612 doesn't cut it in todays digital camera market,"2.3 megapixels....you'd expect near perfect quality and great photos every shot right? Well if you think that, then try a different camera, because this HP does not give you near perfect quality pics. At the best quality the camera can hold 6 pictures in it's internal memory, and the pictures are a huge display of 1792 X 1200 with a DPI of ONLY 300. Also every picture taken is different from the last, there is no image consistency. Oh, and if you are wanting to use the camera for low light shots, think again because the pictures get really grainy in the dark. Now if the camera has an ability to capture 2.3 megapixels, where are these mysterious pixels vanishing too? This question has also led me to another question, why did I buy this camera. Both lead to the same answer... ""I don't know."""
4,Not Bad! Good Seller Should buy from him again... prob will,I bought a camera from him and i gave it a 4 because the cam says 2.31 megapixels and the cam i had was 2.1 megapixel also from hp and the thing is that this cam is not performing 2.31 megapixel i am sure of it.. the pics from the 2.1 cam was better than the one i just bought from him *refurbished* 2.31.... anyways i will not return it because I woudn't want to wait an other week ... if you give me a chance i like to return it and get the one i had before which got stolen .. it's the one before this one so email me to yamelmontero@hotmail.com and let me know the price is not far apart less than 20 dollars but this one cost more so it's ok... bye.
1,Dissapointed,"For the money this camera did not meet my expectations. All of the pictures were grainy and dark. Takes great pictures outdoors, but indoors, it was terrible. Since you can't adjust anything on this camera, there is nothing you can do but live with it. The 'shutter speed' is slow. It took forever to take the picture. I exchanged this camera in 2 days. Even after we used software to fix the pictures, they still looked bad. (We bought an HP photosmart printer and the pictures looked bad. It wasn't the printer, but the source: THE CAMERA!)Granted I'm new to the digital camera world, but I would have expected this quality from a 1.X mega pixel camera. Spend a little more money on an Olympus and get a camera you'll like. The picture quality is not worth the price of this camera. I wouldn't recomend this camera to the very novice buyer. It's terrible."
2,Mechanical problems,"I have had this camera for 4 years now. The picture quality is wonderful inside or out, i have blown up photos and they are beautiful. My problem is that sometimes the camera lens does not retract when turned off. Then I could not turn it back on. HP service had me return the camera for a second one - same problem, then they exchanged it again. This third camera worked fine for 3 years then the lcd display went awry followed by the familiar error 109 display when the lens will not retract. Now I cannot even turn it on or off. It's good when it works and awful when it doesn't."
2,Extremely Disappointed!,"The level of explanation and knowledge shared in this product was very elementary. I expected much more from a Trump product. If you want some good real estate info read George Roth's book or Robert Kiyosaki, who by the way I think the two guys on this Trump set were trying to be like."
1,Bad product : DO NOT BUY,"I do not recommend this product. Does not help my jeans/Trousers stay on, especially when you are sitting and getting up a lot (I work at an office where I have to move a lot). Do not buy. Use that money to purchase a larger size of jeans or a pair of maternity pants."
3,Good..but not great,"Being plus size and pregnant, I was happy to find this in my size. I had visions of being able to wear my jeans unbuttoned and unzipped for awhile longer like I've read that these things are capable of doing. THANK GOD I did not use this today for that purpose. First, this does not conceal undone jeans! No way, no how you can see the imprint through your shirt. I did wear my maternity panel jeans today with this and it does smooth out that panel crease nicely. However, by the time I got to work, the band had creeped up around my upper waist. Annoying, but not a huge deal. Fixed it in the bathroom and so far, so good. I bought one in black and one in white in size 4. They are a bit too loose so I'm thinking I should have gotten a size 3 even though the chart said I should be a size 4. They are also a little longer than necessary. Kind of uncomfortable with it all the way under my bra...."
3,It's ok..,"I read alot of reviews before buying this and i think i was expecting to much. This basically reminds me of a tube top pulled down. I ordered the correct size, but i still have to pull it up once in a while and it does bunch up at the bottom after sitting for a while. Not the best piece of maternity clothing ever, but not the worst."
2,Basically does it's job,I recently purchased a belly band at 15 weeks pregnant. I have some maternity pants that are a little too big and some of my regular jeans that are a little too small so this seemed like the perfect solution. I've worn it a few times and it does hold my pants up but requires A LOT of adjusting. It bunches all around and always rides up above the back of the pants. I'm in and out of a desk chair many times during the day which I'm sure adds to this problem. Everytime I get up or sit down I have to pull the band back into place. It may come in more handy later on in the pregnancy but right now it's just a hassle.
3,It works ok.,I should have ordered a smaller size even though I used the guide. I found it too loose. I still wore it though.
2,Sizes are off,Bought this for my wife according to the supplied sizing chart and it seems real loose kind of like a normal shirt this may be to not put pressure on the baby belly but it did not seem to fit like it should
4,Great product,Was very satisfied with the product and it is super comforter but sizing is not accurate. Go for a size smaller than the chart.
4,Great for 2nd Trimester,"I bought a few of these bands in different colors and LOVED THEM. I used them throughout my entire 2nd trimester since this was my 1st pregnancy and my bump was smaller than others. I was able to get away with wearing my pre-pregnancy close the whole trimester and avoid buying expensive maternity clothes that didn't fit quite so right.I'm tall, weighed between 165-175 during the 2nd trimester, so it works great with tall ladies with long torsos too. I dropped a star because the bands did begin to loose their elasticity after a while. I know this is expected, but the black on in particular lost its stretchiness the quickest. I mostly used the black and the white one.I'm now in the 3rd trimester and I still use the bands at times. I wouldn't recommend it for support, although it does give you a ""secure"" feeling. If you are in between maternity clothes and pre-pregnancy clothes, then I DEFINITELY recommend this."
3,Just use a tube top!,"This does what it says in general. However, if you have a tube top at home, then all you have to do is pull it down to cover your pants. The belly band basically only covers the zipper-fly so that it doesn't show, but it does not hold your pants up. You can really do the same with a tube top."
3,Too long...,This is my second band. The first was so much better because it was shorter. This one is so long it is like a giant tube top.
4,review,this is a great product for early pregnancy and i also plan on using this producy post pregnancy as well. i would reccomend it to anyone!
4,great bridge between my clothes & maternity clothes,"I love this product. I'm only getting into my 4th month now, but being overweight before my pregnancy, I didn't want to buy maternity clothes yet. Adding this to pants extenders is a great bridge between. The band provides coverage from just under the bra all the way down to my hips, so there's plenty of room for my belly to expand in the coming months. The surprise was that I felt added support across my belly. I'd definitely encourage women looking for a way to continue wearing their own clothes for a while. Only caveat is that your shirts do need to be a little longer, as the band does not hide the fact that your zipper/button is open/expanded & some may not be comfortable with that."
4,Great support!,"I was very content with my purchase of two belly bands. I hoped that by the time I reached almost six months, they would've fit better up on top. They do, however, provide great belly support and, unless I'm wearing full panel maternity pants, I really miss them when I don't put them on. I do have a while to go though so I'm sort of glad they are still a little loose on top because it means I can wear them for a while!"
3,Too big,I am 16 weeks pregnant. I ordered the size 2 (my jean size is usally a 4 or 6). The belly band kept falling down and was loose around my waist. I guess I need to wait until the baby grows a little more for it to fit. It's too bad because I'm in that in-between stage and my regular pants don't fit me anymore!
3,it rolls and bunches,i didn't like mine at all would roll up and look like a belt .. Didn't work for me at all..
3,Great for weekend wear,"I bought this when I was further along than I should have, and found that the material stretched out rather fast. I can't use it for work because the material loosens and it no longer hold things in place. I know it's not supposed to 'hold up' your pants, but the material will actually start to bunch and ride up, usually exposing my behind or lower back. I find that it's best for days around the house, where you just want to wear some jeans, but you don't have to worry about constantly adjusting in front of others. I do believe that if I had used this product before my belly really got large, that it would have worked better."
2,Rolls up,"This band constantly rolls up/doesn't stay in place and was poorly made. After wearing it twice the bottom seam started fraying and strings were hanging down. And any movements seem to make the band travel up...revealing everything I am trying to hide (ie. underwear, unzipped pants). So I feel this band is useless. I shouldn't have to adjust it every time I stand up. As far as fit, it definitely seems to loosen up quickly after you wear it which also may be part of the problem."
3,Eh,I wasn't impressed. Didn't fit around my belly and I was certain I got the right size. It actually kind of hurt when I was wearing it because it was so tight.
5,Unsure of size? Choose the smaller one.,"Love the product, but ordered two different sizes because I was in-between size 3 and 4 (size 18) according to the sizing chart. The smaller of the two works and fits perfectly. The larger one is too loose and doesn't hold my pants up and doesn't support my growing belly. I ordered two more of the smaller size and am very happy with the products. Also worth mentioning, the dark colors ""hide"" unzipped pants much better then the lighter colors.If this review was helpful, please vote by clicking yes below."
4,Good product.,"Bought several of these in different colors, and am very pleased. I wish there was a little more elasticity to them, but then it's still early in my pregnancy, and I may be grateful that they're looser later on. Only complaint I have is that when you do unbutton your pants underneath the band, it's impossible to shake the feeling your pants are slipping down, even when they're not. It's just distracting. The black band with the white pattern is my favorite, both in terms of how it looks, but also the material."
3,"Okay, but not as good as bellaband","I ordered this band as well as the Bellaband, and there is no contest between them. The Bellaband is a superior product. The material is higher quality and it has a sticky band at the bottom to help hold up your pants. The Baby Be Mine band lacks this band and the material stretches out easier. That being said, if you can't splurge on the Bellaband, then this one will probably do the trick."
3,Runs big,"Okay,I might be a skinny one,but got the smallest size and it was huge!!!! It only got useful for me since 32d week... But idea is very good. As i didnt have to buy a single preggers pants!"
3,Maternity band,"The Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Band is a good product, but not if you are looking for amazing support. It is very long which is a great feature because it allows you to cover your full belly and down over your pants. I would buy again."
3,"Good, but doesn't stay in place","I liked the belly band, and I would probably buy it again - but maybe try a different size. I was a size 6-8 pre-pregnancy and I bought a size 2. The band creeps up often throughout the day, and I find myself constantly trying to adjust it. I started using it at 14 weeks, so maybe it will also fit better once I get a little bigger. I am glad I have it though - because otherwise I would have very few pairs of pants to wear in this in between stage as my bump grows."
2,Decent but too big,This is supposed to be a transition band so it really doesn't need to be this big. Even after folding it in half it was still too big. I wish I would have bought the band that is only 5-6 inches long. I just gave up and bought maternity pants.
3,ok,"i hoped this would be tighter, i know it says that the purpose is not to hold up pants, but who are we kidding, ladies. it doesnt make an open fly totally smooth, but under a loose fitting shirt, it does the trick. just sorta streaches out throughout the day."
3,Not what I was looking for,I was looking for something to give me a little more support. I should have gotten one or two sizes smaller than what they suggested. Once I took it in on the sides it worked much better.
2,Makes me look funny,"I ordered it in the correct size, i run 14-16. The material is too thin to camoflage the button on my fly makes me look obviously like I didn't button my pants. I did order black per another reviewers advice. The only think it is working for is keeping my current maternity pants up longer and giving me a tiny bit more of a shape. Kinda sad because I hate maternity jeans and this was just a big waste of money buy the original Bella band and spend a few more $$ for a better product."
4,"Good, but prefer the ones from Motherhood","This is a good product and it worked well for me. However, I prefer the ones from Motherhood (which are pretty much the same price since you don't have to pay shipping)since they are made out of a stretchier material that maintain their shape much better. The ones from Motherhood are not as long as these are, which made me hesitant at first, but I still found them plenty big."
2,Quality lacked,"I was satisfied when I first recieved this product, however after a few washes the thread had came out of it. Not very satisfied now."
2,Disappointed with product,"I purchased this product at about 8 weeks of pregnancy. I started to use it at 9 weeks of pregnancy, when I could no longer button my jeans. I ordered the 0-6 size, although I wear a size 6 or 8 normally. I was a little concerned that I ordered the smaller size, and while I waited for the product, I wondered if a larger size would be better.This product did not help my jeans stay on, or cinch itself to my waist. It felt as if I had just another t-shirt on. I often found that I had worked up to around my waist, revealing the rubberband that was holding my jeans up.I do not recommend this product. You will be better off purchasing a larger size of jeans or a pair of maternity pants."
1,Don't waste your money on this brand...,"Honestly, pass on this item. The band does a really poor job in the in-between phase. It doesn't hold your pants, nor does it stay in place. The sizing chart is off too. Buy the ""BellaBand"" brand instead, which is a much, much better product!"
3,Belly belt works better,"I bought this thinking I would wear it all the time; I only did a couple of times. I wore it with a belly belt though, to help cover & smooth my pants. It seemed like the belly band didn't stay in place very well & my shirts seemed more prone to rolling up. Lately I've just been wearing my belly belt with a long tank top, I prefer the Full Tilt Seamless CamiFULL TILT Girls Seamless Cami. I would skip the band and just buy the belly beltFertile Mind Women's Maternity Belt."
4,Not just for maternity,"I bought this intending to use for pregnancy, but have not gotten the opportunity yet. Despite that, I wear the two I ordered several times a week. I ordered the pink and the black in Size 1. I am 5' 5.5"", 130lbs. I love having something snug to use as a layer (I can't stand shirts that are too short. I have a long torso and no tolerance for skin showing when I reach or bend.) So I love these. I fiddle with them, yes. I suppose a long tank would also work, but I'm picky about those and have only found a few that really work for length without adding too much bulk to my neckline. I wear these lower than I probably would if I were sporting a baby bump. They are definitely NOT going to work like Spanx, but I do like feeling like a have a little extra snugness over my ""problem region"" (tummy and ""love handles""). My gut (haha) is that I will not need to size up, even for pregnancy. If I get a chance to use these under those circumstances, I'll leave an update back here!"
5,Belly band,"LOVE IT!!! Not the best to hold up low rise jeans, but its only supposed to cover the opening. I use mine to hold up my dress pants at work though."
3,Somewhat lives up to expectations,"My husband and I are expecting our 2nd child and are being as cautious as possible in every penny we spend on this pregnancy. I am a large woman (size 24) and purchased a muplti pack of 3 bands in size 4. I do wish I had spent the extra money on the actual ""Bella Band"". On the packaging it states that the Baby Be Mine bands are not to be expected to hold pants, etc. up. That was something that I needed the bands for. If this information had been available on the product description, I would have not purchased them.The bands do make me feel more secure than when I do not wear them. They do thankfully help to make up for the gap between shirt and pants when being active. Lastly, these bands are not that bad, they just did not meet my full expectations."
3,Not super stretchy...didn't fit very well.,"I purchased this in a size 2 (my pre-pregnancy size is an 8) and It seemed too big.The problem is that it isn't super stretchy like the similar item that I purchased at Target for a lot less money. It is very wide, so that part was good, but it didn't serve to really hold anything up because of the lack of elasticity.The belly band was still better than not having anything, but it was the last one that I reached for."
3,Sizing seems off,"I ordered 2 to assist me in being able to use my pre-pregnancy clothes longer and my maternity clothes while they are still a little big. According to their sizing I should get a size 2 (I was an 8-10 prepregnancy). However, the size 2 is so loose that it isn't snug enough to allow me to wear my pants unbuttoned or to hold my maternity pants tighter. I am very disappointed!"
4,Wish there were more sizes available!,"I really like this product, but they didn't have the product in my size, so I got the size bigger and it is way to big. The material is very nice and soft and it does work. I would recommend it to my friends!"
4,"Try it before buying it, but could work for you.","The product is sure good, but wish I had chance to try it on before buying it. I think I would have been more comfortable if I had bought Large size even though my pre-pregnancy size is Medium.Like others mentioned, you need to keep adjusting the belt when you sit and get up.I still gave 4 stars because if its good fit, it sure will save you some $$$ if you could put off or buy few maternity pants."
5,Very good experience,"Everything as promised thats all a consumer can ask for... place an order, have it arrive on and time and be what you asked for in the condition promised. Thanks!"
5,Love this product!!!!,"This is the most helpful article of maternity wear that I have purchased. As this is my first pregnancy and I didn't really pay attention to what friends/relatives did when they had been pregnant, I didn't know these things existed. I had to read all the reviews on these before I bought them. I went back and forth between two sizes and found that the smaller size does work the best. At 29 weeks along, I can still wear most of my pre-pregnancy shirts thanks to these wonderful things -- And they cost less than a maternity shirt!! They are comfortable, add a small amount of support, gives the appearance of a ""layered"" look without roasting you, and works well with my maternity jeans/pants in hiding the panels. I have ended up with 5 different bands of different colors and love them. I can see that I will even be able to wear them post pregnancy when I transition back into my ""regular"" clothes."
2,won't stay up!,"Everyone around me suggested the belly bands, but I couldn't figure out how to keep them up! Every time i sit down the belly band would fold and need adjusting the moment I stood up. Seemed to defeat the purpose to me. I figured it was because I was too small, but then again that's the point of the bands--to help with that in between stage when your belly is growing but not big enough for the maternity pants! I didn't even take the tags off my second band, and I won't use the bands for future pregnancies."
3,Not really recommended if you carry low,"I suspect that this product works better if you carry high instead of low. Because I carry very low, the band needs to be very low down to cover my unzipped pants, and keeps riding up. Folding it in half or in fourths helps to keep it tighter. It may be more useful post-partum."
3,"not a bad product, but not going to hold your pants up!","If you have any skill with a sewing machine, it might be just as easy to cut a fitted tee just under the armpits and hem the top. This isn't stretchy or strong enough to actually hold up your pants, but it does layer nicely and look like you are wearing a cami or something under your shirt. I wear mine a lot, but won't be buying anymore as I can buy shirts at goodwill and make my own."
5,Absolutely love it !,"I have almost every color and design of this product. I started with the basic black band to use at work, but when I used and realized how good it was, I bought multiple sizes and colors for the 1st and 2nd trimaster. They are definitely life savers. I saved so much money by being able to use my pants almost till the 5th month, thanks to belly bands. I recommend this product to every pregnant women out there. I was also very happy with the customer service, fast delivery, excellent support. Don't wait, just buy this band, you won't regret it."
2,Not worth it,I bought these thinking they would be fine for just in my truck tool box to use sparingly and they are a little cheaper than I was expecting the open end is kinda rounded and cheap but they are $20 so cant expect too much I wish I would have spent 10 or 20 bucks more for a little nicer one.
5,Decent,"A near complete set and outstanding for the price. Time will tell more, but I don't see how I could lose on this (although I see the price has increased slightly)."
2,EL PEDIDO NO LLEGO DE ACUEDO A LO MOSTRADO,"LAS LLAVES LLEGARON REPETIDAS EN MILIMETROS, LAS EN PULGADAS NO LLEGARON Y EL PORTA LLAVE NO ES EL MOSTRADO EN LA PUBLICACION"
2,"Works, but BOTH packaging and product contains cancer causing substances!","Well, they work well...but I was surprised to see a California warning stating that BOTH the package and product contain cancer causing substances. So, I'm guessing that cheap fillers were used in the product, obviously from China. Thank you Corporate America, for putting money in front of safety yet again."
1,Dont believe what you see,"Item looks nothing like the photo. What I got was 22 wrenches in two metal holders that have no handle, don't fit together and fall out immediately if you move them in any way. Decent though cheaply made wrenches but totally useless until I find another case for them. Complete and utter rip off."
4,GOOD BACK-UP SET,"I checked the indicated dimensions and they were all pretty good. Wrences are fairly well chromed and the thickness of the steel is about the same as my Snap-On wrenches. Haven't used them yet but don't expect any problems. Remember, you get what you pay for! Made in India"
4,Warm & Pleasing Performance,"Not the most riveting performance of these classic quartets, but very engaging, very warm renditions. I think this quartet has an affection for Haydn, they handle him very carefully and traditionally. I enjoy listening to this CD."
5,Husband loves Caroling Herrera,This is a yearly Christmas gift that my husband loves receiving during Christmas. He loves the fragrance and doesn't need to use but a little.
2,Five star review -I don't think so,"Amid some of the rave reviews here I would like to add a note of caution. This is not a great thriller for me - maybe I prefer stronger stuff - but this novel has very little that will live on in the memory. Perhaps if you like some of the female authors mentioned you might like this, but to say that this book was a great success in the British Isles is wildly overstating the case."
3,a promising start - a disappointing ending,"When I began this novel, I thought it was fantastic! The characters were very well developed and the plot caught my attention right away. How ever as the story developed, I lost interest in the main characters, and found that the ending was underwhelming. It seemed as if Parsons was rushing to tie up the loose ends, and I knew what was going to happen about half way through the book. I would have liked to know more about Margaret and the others, and I was left unsatisfied at the end. Having read all of Ruth Rendell, Elizabeth George, and Minette Walters, to name a few favorites, the author still has a long way to go to be put in the same category as these great authors."
2,Not enough story,"I was expecting this to be a can't put down thriller. However, I found it boring and too long. It's really two stories, Mary's murder and the unexciting investigation leading to the killer's capture, and then the trial and its aftermath. I never came to care for the main character, Mary's mother, and found much of her behavior in the first half unbelievable. The ending is not a surprise and neither of the stories is exciting. And there's way too much reminiscing (much of it repetitive) and lyrical description."
2,disappointing,"This book has received good reviews, but I'm shaking my head wondering why. The writing is quite good, but it's the sort of book that feels like the author had great fun writing poetic images and never gave much thought to story or character. I felt as though I were seeing the charcters through frosted glass. They were not developed and I didn't much care about them. The several threads of plot were likewise never developed. And there were holes and inconsistencies, as well aa a few mistakes in the story. I felt the author was lazy and took the easy way out. Instead of dealing with the difficult issue of writing a cohesive novel with real characters and emotional tension, she indulged in disjointed segments of eloquent prose."
2,"Mary, Mary","Although the story line was good, there was way too much reminiscing by Mary's mother Margaret, and no preparation for it. In the shadow of Mary's murder, Margaret explores the memory of her relationship with her own father and Mary's father, who seems to be a figment of her imagination. I found myself going back a lot to figure out if this was just happening or if Margaret was remembering again. There's a twist at the end, but it doesn't take you on the edge of your seat, it just stumbles through."
2,Nowhere near as good as it was hyped up to be,"Having just read this book in England, I have to say that I was sorely disappointed. I was expecting a thrilling tale, yet I got a confusing one, set in Ireland that interchanged the past and present all the time, making it very confusing. The Chapters were too short and the changing from character to character was also annoying, especially if it took you a while to work out what was going on. This book was full of hype in England, meant to be a really good one, yet it was nowhere near as good as it could and should have been. Not recommended if you are a Cornwell lover, or James Patterson etc. In fact, I would hardly recommend this at all. Sorry!"
5,A little gem of a book!,"This book seems very innocuous at first glance, but there is not a page devoid of truth or useful wisdom. The author uses language which might seem crass to some, but I prefer that to mainstream, dry and monotonous (ahem; eckhart tolle) blather that lines the shelves of the spiritual section of B&N. The author does not yammer on, citing other references or boring the reader with case histories or anecdotal input. This book has soul."
4,Parent Friendly Toddler Music,"Amazon needs to develop a music selection category associated with frequency of play and childrens music. Because most parents out there can only handle a certain amount of most music played over and over again before losing control and snapping a Mr.Giggles CD in half as you tell the child ""look over there"".Upside Down is an exception. Although I have not experienced continual play in excess of 90 minutes, Jack Johnson can hang in there with adults and kids alike."
4,Right Side Up,"There just hasn't been many great songs that have been shown from movies recently. Yet, it is quite sad, there still are very few ones that have delivered quite nicely. Jack Johnson has definitely been one of those surprising ones that have brought it very well to the public. His latest single, Upside Down from the animated film Curious George is a delightful little diddy that delivers to both adualts and kids of all ages. I love this song a lot because it is just simple, and delightful to listen to. I hope that there can be good songs like this from Jack down the road, and I hope there can be better ones from the movies soon.Song: B 1/2+"
2,"As usual with JJ singles, get the correct version","Seems all of the EU singles are the ones worth getting, anything else and you are short changing yourself for songs and content.The 2 track version has breakdown and the title track... not worth the money.The 3 track version + video gives you the title track and 2 live recordings.Overall a very friendly easy listening single with no standout songs. Good for background music but nothing groundbreaking here in terms of new versions."
2,Disappointed,"I love Jack Johnson, Let me say LOVE him, but I was very disappointed that I paid $9.99 for 2 songs. It was probably my fault for not reading the list of songs but still shouldn't there be more than 2 songs for $9.99."
2,Just so so,"I liked the one song - Upside Down, but I really didn't care for the rest of the CD. There weren't many songs on it anyway. I wouldn't buy another CD from this artist."
3,"Interesting toy, but with some issues","I got one of these in a package of christmas cat toys that was on sale at a chain petstore in my area.It has a short rod, ~4"" long and a rather thin elastic cord.The ""toy"" itself is about 6"" long when straight.It has an interesting ""crawling"" motion when you drag in on the floor and the cats definately find it interesting.My only concerns with this toy would be:1. The eyes are glued on, so might easily come off2. The elastic that holds it together is somewhat exposed and kitty would definately be able to chew it apart.Because of this, I'd definately say this one is for supervised play only. But, generally a good toy for the price."
4,Made my installation clean,Was able to mount and wire my radio real nice so it looks prefessional. A bit pricy but figure you get a lot more stuff than you will need in the end.
4,Very pleased,I was very happy with the kit and crutchfield even called to make sure I had the right one. Just be sure to get the right kit for your radio.
5,Install Kit,Product was exactly what I needed to do a professional installation of my Sirius receiver. The delivery time of two days when I only requested standard delivery more than exceeded my expectations and the price was the lowest available.
2,Tepid. Not one of her best.,"I read this one not knowing that it was a sequel. Maybe if I had read ""A Woman Without Lies"" first I might have had a better appreciation for the characters here. The plotline is pretty thin: Guy rescues girl. Less than a week later, girl is in love with guy. Guy has a kind of 'inferiority complex' that gets in the way of their relationship. The setting is supposedly in contemporary Canada, but you don't get much of a feel for it since most of the story took place either on the boat or on the deserted island with no other people around. Although the story squeezed a few tears from me, I would've liked more excitement & adventure in it. ""Lover in the Rough"" was much better."
5,WHERE ARE ALL THE RAVEN'S.:)),"I just loved this story, couldn't put it down.I had read Woman Without Lies years ago and loved that story also.Raven what a man!! what a hero !I found the story moving and the love between Raven and Janna passionate and exciting.Love Elizabeth Lowell books:):):)"
2,Embarassingly bad....,"""Love Song For a Raven"" had the potential to be fantastic, but the writing and the dialogue were so flowery and ridiculous that I couldnt help but cringe. I thought that the characters were woefully underdeveloped and the love between them blossomed so fast that it bordered on unbelievable. Raven was ok..but his whole ""Gratitude/Love"" thing grew tired..and Janna was just plain annoying...I would have given this only 1 star, but it IS an Elizabeth Lowell and this was OBVIOUSLY one of her earlier efforts. All in all I definitely would NOT recommend this."
4,Love Song for A Raven shines in prose,"LOVE SONG FOR A RAVEN lacks the emotional intensity of Elizabeth Lowell's A Woman without Lies - with Angel and Hawk but the melodrama, sea-rescue and romance between Janna and Raven saved this otherwise diluted read. Face it - Ms. Lowell weaves sensual magical story like a tragic love paean that aims straight for the heart and such tortured souls are Janna and Raven, that they are willing to deny the passion and even discard love. Janna has an unfruitful marriage with her gay husband; Raven lost his confidence when his love for Angel sunk. Her stories are so soul-wrenching that they make you wallow in tears and compassion. At the end of the story, when you recall the plot - it ends up lacking in substance. It's the acute writing that overwhelms and the magical ending we have all been waiting for.Throw away you common sense and just follow your heart - and Love Song for a Raven will guide you to an enchanting read which you will enjoy."
3,"OK, nothing special","I read the ""sort of"" prequel to this ""A Woman Without Lies."" It didn't really add a whole lot. Some of the scenes where very passionate. But the characters spent the entire book lying to each other. If they had told the truth, been honest about their feelings, they could have gotten on with their lives. I guess I'm just sick of stupid people."
5,Great merchant,"The book I asked for was old and I was pleased to see a new version all in good shape. Great merchant. Fast timing, product as promised."
5,"Best of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis by Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis",Martin and Lewis were to me the greatest comedy team when I was growing up.

4,Solo deje yo a mi padre--it's the bomb!,"To anyone who's thinking about buying this CD, one song stands out among all--Solo deje yo a mi Padre. The beautiful background sounds of birds chirping give it an added nostalgic touch for anyone who has left their parents behind in search of better future in the United States. I recommend it to anyone who knows what I'm talking about."
5,Love it!,"I love this book. I could not put it down. It is an honest and funny story about the author's experience writing for T.V. shows and about the stars he has met through the years. If you are looking for a, can't put down book, buy this one. You will not be disappointed. This book will not be re-sold by me. It will go into my bookcase to be re-read in the future. I do hope E. Klass writes another one as he still has more stories to tell and I would love to hear them."
4,Fact or fiction?,"This book is a fun, easy, very fast read. I could not put it down. But I am left wondering if it is true or not. As he readily indicates in the story, he is a habitual liar. He lies in order to try to make a buck. So, is his story truth or more lies? Who knows?The book is billed as an insider's view, the true story, etc. But this guy failed. In fact, his character has very few morals whatsoever. So I wonder what the real insider view is, perhaps as written from someone with a bit more character and who did not fail.If true, I feel sorry for the author because he obviously did not have much common sense and was repeatedly taken in by an individual he thought was his agent. If false, I feel sorry for all the people who will read it an believe it to be true."
5,Family fun and happy tunes,"Fun, great songs, teleportation plus a little romance, and a new spin on the ageless story of Santa Claus. Plus a really bad guy (why can't Snavely live without deer kabobs and just let Christmas be? lose the melter and get off our case Snavely). So who knew Santa has a daughter Sandy who's ready to make her way in the world? My two kids loved the story and the music -- and my 13 year old loves the hightech promise of teleportation (he says he wondered how Santa answers the wishes of a zillion kids each year and now wants a Teleporter for Christmas). They can't seem to stop singing the tunes of the North Poleans. I think my 11 year-old daughter has a new role model. Sharp, interesting film production with quality singing and action. Good to see a new twist on my favorite holiday! Now, if I can just get some of these melodies out of my brain..."
2,Too darn loud,"If you're going to put this thing in a closet with a heavy door and insulation, you could be OK - It's performance is great. It's just too darn loud. I returned it for a more costly D-Link switch."
2,Get GS724T instead,"This could be a nice switch, if the firmware update can be available. However, Netgear had stopped issue any firmware update to this switch for some years.On the other hand, GS724T switch is being constantly updated with latest bug fix and protocol supports, etc. So I end up returned this one and get the GS724T instead. GS724T works very well."
1,No effect after MONTHS of use! Carlson let me down!,"I bought Carlson brand Vitamin D after my Doctor told me I had a vitamin D deficiency (Based on a blood test). I took 2000 iu for 3-4 months with meals as directed. I just had another blood test, and I am about the same. Very little if any change after 3-4 months of Carlson Vitamin D.I DO NOT THINK THIS BRAND WAS ABSORBED INTO MY BODY!I an very disappointed with Carlson as I thought I bought a premium brand.I will try another brand that will hopefully be absorbed and not just pass through my system.I will read some more reviews here on Amazon, and hopefully find a better brand.Don't waste your time and money on Carlson!"
3,Fun but plays through really fast.,"My 8 yo beat this on easy level in about 9 hours. He's not really interested in going back for 100% completion. The game play is really easy so he didn't get frustrated like in Force unleashed, but man, lesss than 24 hours? I was disappointed."
3,Poor Crash...,"The game is a blast, but it just isn't Crash. You might as well be playing Ty, Jak and Daxter, Scaler, etc. But most of all, it really reminds me of ""Sponge Bob: Battle for Bikini Bottom"". It's as if the game was written and developed without reguard to who the title character would be. The only things that are distinctively Crash, like crates and wumpa fruit are just thrown in at random. Any character could have played the title role.In addition, all of the characters have been redesigned. They look fine (except Tiny), but again dissapointing.As I said, the game is really fun and quite well done, but don't buy it expecting your beloved Bandicoot! In reality, this is only a Crash Bandicoot game, so that they can bank on the name recognition. It's sad really."
2,its ok,THe story line is hard to follow and the overall layout of the pages is aful and its not because i was reading the wrong way.the drawings are half decent but found myself not wanting to read it there is much better sci fi out there.check out neogenis evagelion or nadesico.
1,Waste of money,"You can find more variety and more current information and support online, wihtout the obsession with abnormally large penises. The best site is Tom Hubbard's Practical Penis Enlargement (do a Yahoo search). He's also got links to sites where guys discuss small penis issues, as well as a forum for discussing technique and progress with others. Don't fall for the vacuum pump and surgery hype!"
2,Mediocre,"The message of the book is this: A big penis is everything. Without a big penis, you're less than a real man.The book is filled with a lot of pseudoscience and useless techniques. The book fails to mention about how use of the penis pump can result in a serious medical condition.The part about the legendary endowments of famous men makes the book mildly amusing to read."
1,Angst in Austin,"After buying this book, I was extremely unsettled and felt even more inadequate about my size. My ego was shattered by my last girlfriend, who laughed at me, and I've been unable to keep an ere****n. Between that and reading this book, I may never have sex again."
2,Practical Methods of Penis Enlargement,"The book documents what is a small, average and large sized penis with much time (and illustrations/photographs) being devoted to grossly over-sized phalluses. The book is worth reading if your aim is to enlarge your undersized penis (<4 inches) and it documents several methods of doing so. I did come away feeling that having an under-sized penis was a very negative condition to have but could be remmedied."
3,disappointing,The conclusion of this story did not hold up well for me.Overall I would not recommend the For Tomorrow series.
4,"Great art, okay writing","the art by Jim Lee is gorgeous and very well detailed, as has come to be expected from him, but the real problem with this thing is the writing.There can be times when the dialogue is a little off and some characters are just not themselves for the writers convenience. Although it is still an enjoyable, somewhat interesting story, it certainly isn't a great one.Over all I'd still recommend it for the price it is being sold for, no problem"
5,"good book, great artwork","I can only speak for myself, but I loved this book. I purchased it primarily for the art by Jim Lee. His art is the top of the Comic universe. His layouts are entertaining, his anatomy is spot on and Scott Williams is a genius inker.The story, I thought, was really good. Especially in conclusion to Volume 1. Some of the dialog can be a bit quick. There is too much of the characters speaking over each other and finishing each-other's sentences.But the story itself was really good. It may be a bit hard to follow. I sometimes had to read the same page a quick second time.I also love the fact that Superman is not quite so perfect in this story.Over-all, a great book."
5,Nautilus Men's 1330 Steel Toe,Shoe fits great and feel fine. Could use a little more padding but padding very good over all. Seem like a lot of steel toe shoes are short on padding. But a lot of steel toe boots are better for padding. But over all great shoe. Great price and free shipping. It take amazon longer to ship than for free shipping to get here which was only 2 days(to get here). But over all the time from order to getting product was good.
3,Limited Use,"Where I live often floods during the spring, which requires removal of the doors on the ground floor garage when the water comes up. The barn swallows find this to be an irresistible invitation to find a nesting place. I had hoped streamers of the tape would discourage their nesting activity, but they did not. However, the tape placed along the handrails on the back deck does seem to be discouraging the birds from sitting and ""hanging out"" with their friends."
2,Didn't work for me,"This tape didn't work for my purpose. I strung it over my strawberries hoping to scare the quail away because they were devastating my crop. They must have thought it meant ""party time"" because I think it actually attracted all their friends. It wasn't a costly experiment, so no huge loss. Maybe it works for everything but quail."
3,feed back,it really did not drive the woodpeckers away.the more i hung out there the more it was pecking . pecking
2,Doesn't solve problem for birds at dawn/dusk and night,"I have birds that land on my car side mirrors and crap everywhere. I have been trying to find different deterrents to stop them, including a fake owl, plastic bags on the side mirrors, and now this tape. I put the tape on my antenna and on a round paper towel tube and connected it to my window wiper lifted out of the car (so basically I had several strands of the tape flowing above the spot the birds like to hang out). No dice, didn't deter a single bird. Problem is that the birds come out at dusk/dawn and in the middle of the night to do their bidding, so reflective tape w/o sunshine isn't very...reflective. I have no idea if this stuff works in the sun, but its not a solution that will work for me."
2,Not effective at all!,"If you are like me you rely very heavily on the customer reviews posted on Amazon. I felt obligated to share my experience of using Dalen's Bird Scare Tape in my garden. After I planted my garden I began to have heavy bird traffic. I wanted to find a safe way to rid the birds. I thought the Scare Tape was the perfect choice to safely ward off the invaders. I followed the directions and strategically set the tape out in several areas of the garden. The birds were not intimidated in the least. In fact, one morning I saw one bird perched next to a piece of tape while his comrades terrorized my garden. Unfortunately, this product proved ineffective."
3,Doesnt work on pigeons,"I had pigeons pooping all over my porch. I bought this tape (to try the easy way first) and it did nothing. City pigeons I guess are use to reflective materials. They parked right next to it, not giving the tape a second thought. I ended up buying some bird mesh and blocked them from the beam they were perching on and that kept them out. Tape did nothing. Gave it 3 stars cause it might work on other birds. Pigeons = No"
1,Bird Scare Tape - Useless,The birds were playing and pecking at it. Don't bother. This stuff looks a lot like shinny ribbon you can get at a craft or party store.
1,Bird Scare Tape,"I was rather disappointed in the Bird Scare Tape. Within two days I had birds trying to carry the tape off. They would get it in their beak, then try and fly away. It didn't provide much of a 'scare' to the birds."
5,Exactly what I ordered and came quickly.,Exactly what I ordered and it came quickly. I haven't seen any birds around my new little cherry tree so I guess it works?!!
3,Holographic Tape,It's pretty good. The birds stayed off the dock for awhile until they figured out that the tape wasn't going to attack them. When it comes to keeping birds off of something there is really no silver bullet. This is more cost effective than most items. It will not phase the predator birds. They just don't care.
1,Does not work,The birds and squirrels eating the figs on my fig tree are in no way intimidated by these scare tape. It does not work! Don't waste your money.
3,for birds,I think that twirling this tape and attaching on my porch railing helped. I had robins messing on the porch and banging into the porch windows
1,WOODPECKERS AREN'T IMPRESSED,I purchased this product with the hopes that it would frighten the droves of woodpeckers in our area from drilling our redwood home. We've had woodpeckers pecking just out of reach of the strands of Scare Tape! Best of luck to the rest of you with woodpecker problems....
2,doesn't work,the birds loved it! didn't scare them in the least. Worked the first day and then they got used to it.
4,holographic scare tape,The tape did not deter the jays from taking my nuts this fall. Are there specific birds that the makers know the tape works on?
2,Ha!,"I tied some of this around my car's antenna to try to keep birds from crapping all over it. The next day, it was gone. I guess it scared the birds so much, they came and ate it."
4,Scared our woodpeckers,Seems to have worked for me. No more woodpecker damage on my house in Sierra Nevada since I put up the tape last spring. Had a big problem in past years. Did have some trouble with tape tearing loose in storms. Putting rubber discs under tack heads helped it stay put.
1,Do not buy this!,Well this product just doesn't work for sparrows. They've incorporated it into their nests! Kinda funny. This is just plain old reflective ribbon you can pick up at walmart for a buck - but that's not the point. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. Totally worth the price I paid - for the laugh.
1,Didn't work for me,"I purchased this tape to keep the birds out of my berries and to stop the repeated banging on my windows (our windows are tinted and they seem to be attracted to their reflections). I taped it everywhere, hung it from trees, my porch, chairs, to the plants themselves, and it hasn't done a darn thing. Bummer."
3,Do you remember Shep Fields and his Rippling Rhythm?,"I remember Shep Fields and His Rippling Rhythm. I never thought his was a great band but more of a nvelty band along with the ""rippling rhythm effect"". I never realized that he appeared in several movies during the late '30's as explained in the description brochure. I remember that in the early '40's he changed his music to a more up dated style: nearly all reeds.This is confirmed with several pieces in the CD as his ""Shep Fields and His New Music"". If you enjoy nostalgia you will enjoy Shep Fields and ""That Old Feeling"" CD and Vol 2 of his recordings."
2,"Bland, amateur sounding","I didn't discover the band until 7yrs after this album, so my views might be different than others, but when you compare the song composition from this album to the likes of Front 242's dual releases only 1 year earlier, you'll find this album to be bland and amateur sounding, even for it's time. If it had come out perhaps 10yrs earlier, it would probably be considered groundbreaking industry, but by the time 1994 rolled around, industrial music had vastly matured, this album is musically in the stone age for it's time."
2,Wrong Focus,"I agree with several of the reviewers that this work focuses too much on voyeuristic sexual revelations (and speculations) rather than on the artistic dimensions of O'Keeffe's work and life. I have only read half the book, but will unlikely go on, opting, rather, for a more profound and aesthetically engaged treatment of her life. One wonders when biography becomes gossip."
1,Logos and little substance,"This book is a huge disappointment. About 80% of the content is simply a reprinting of company logos and art work. There is little text and what there is can only be described as ""superficial."" If you are interested in how to brand, what makes branding work, and other pragmatics of the approach, this is not the book to read."
2,Incomplete look At Grant's life,"Cramming the life of Ulysses S. Grant into thirty minutes is impossible and insulting to the memory of a great American. This documentary barely skims the surface and relies upon hackneyed legends and common stock photographs, which they use over and over again.There is no detailed explanation of Grant's rich private life or family, his astute and brilliant generaliship during the Civil War or his flawed Presidency. The narrative limps along, omitting major events in Grant's life and boring the viewer in the process.If you want to discover Ulysses S. Grant, read some of the excellent biographies of him. He was a grand man with a fascinating life and this documentary doesn't begin to illuminate his heart and soul."
1,wrong case...,"Ace Digital orders the case from Meade, which has discontinued it and substitues the newer aluminum finish one instead. If you want the plastic one, don't buy here."
1,Amazon charges but no magazine will arrive.,"Ordered two subscriptions for friends which Amazaon was paid for and the mags never showed. Amazaon says tough luck, take it up with the magazine. Don't order magazines through Amazon."
1,Never received a single copy & was charged in full!!!!,"On top of that penthouse tells me to contact amazon, amazon says to contact penthouse! I can't even file a claim to get reimbursed!!!!"
4,Pets,"This Publication has been around since 1965.Its first Pet was Bambi Lyn Davies,Subscription Manager Elect. There have been a few changes of ownership since it was started by Bob Guccione.The company even had a go at starting a Gentlemen's Club in London.There are even some DVDs around of some of the Pets from the 70s & 80s.Not quite in the same class as Playboy,but for anyone who likes well endowed young ladies,and a good read,try this.However who reads the articles,when there are photos of girls wearing nothing but a smile......."
2,Sick but sometimes quite beautiful,"I know men are dogs, but come on do we still need magazines like this with the internet and all the smut available? I think these magazines are piggish, but even as a hetero woman I can admit to the stunning beauty of some (not all) of the women models. This magazine's photography is sometimes ""soft focus"" which makes it look like it was photographed by a Sears family portrait specialist. I think that clarity, especially in the digital age, is actually more important. So really based on the misogyny and poor photograph clarity, I would say that this dirty magazine is not worth the price."
5,Bushwacker Smoothback Bedrail Caps,"Purchased this product for a red '97 Tacoma. They were very easy to install and look very nice on the truck. They have been on for 20 months and are still looking good. The truck is not garaged so they get full exposure to the sun. They are flexible, but heavy enough to protect the bed rails (we have used the truck for moving furniture, gravel, large stones, soil,mulch, etc.). The truck was also in an accident that involved a side impact that seriously bent one side of the bed. Although the bedrail cap on that side was deformed and popped loose, it was not damaged and easily reinstalled after the bed was repaired. No indication that it ever took the hit. I would definitely buy this product again."
1,Couldn't read the whole thing :(,I'm sure it was engaging 50-60 years ago but now the language is hard to digest and the humor is difficult to decipher.
5,Great recipes and fun garlic trivia,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that the authors have real taste and are not merely garlic loving maniacs. Their food is very good (their Brandade was heavenly) and I really enjoyed reading the garlic trivia. This a fun, yet serious cookbook."
5,"if you love garlic, buy this book!","I've had this for a few months and cooked from it. Very good results and it is very fun for the person who loves garlic, cooking, flavorful dishes.. Good price too on Amazon; I recommend."
3,"Basically manners, done in a interesting well written","& well read way. Lots of common sense here that may cause you to wince if you're above a certain age. We know a lot of this stuff but no longer do it or impart it to our kids. It is no wonder so many of them can't even remember a simple please & thank you.They don""t see us doing it enough. Mr Levine is very big on thank you notes & how kids must do them. Thank-you notes are important after a date, especially a first date (...)?Well, anyway, he is mostly right, & e-mail just won't do. Some old-fashioned advice which is still valid. This tape harkens back to a different, more gentil time, like 20 years ago before the era of instant messaging."
1,A complete waste of time.,"I forced my way through several chapters, but was radically disappointed in this book. If it answers questions that you actually have, then the help you need is something this book cannot provide. It espouses a slimy, lecherous world view that largely betrays typical Jewish values. It was a complete waste of time."
3,"Sometimes inspiring, sometimes just plain goofy","This book really deserves 2 1/2 stars. Some of the entries and quotations really are inspiring while others are just plain goofy. For example, one entry urges the reader to take a nap under a tree after a run. I don't know about you, but I'm sweaty and dirty after a run and the idea of sleeping under a tree isn't appealing. Other times the advice of one day (run harder, don't quit) contradicts the advice of the next day (take it easy, take a day off). I also came to suspect the the writer rehashes some of his advice from daily inspirational books that he has done (golfers and anglers) and I came to wonder if he is a runner himself. That said, I did finish the book in one year and it inspired me to run ocassionally."
5,Inspired!,I received this book about 2 days after I ordered it! I love it! I have been faithfully Inspired every day! Thanks!
2,More Chinese junk!,"First off Made in China should be in the product discription. Secondly it didn't come with any paper work, ie: owners manual, product registration card. Thirdly while trying to adjust the main belt I found two screws that were already stripped out due to inproper alignement. Finaly there is no switching from belt to disk, when it's on both the belt and disk are going so ""Be Careful"".The power is okay, but with all the other bad factors I would stay away!The only saving grace was the company was at least sent a product manual via e-mail."
5,First class album,"The program is unique with rarely heard compositions performed superbly. Nonesuch was a fantastic LP label, and it is nice to see some of their recordings coming to CD."
3,my son loved it,"A simple yet engaging tale of a family reunion which decides to go to an amusement park. Whitney does not pay attention and . . . well the story goes from there. My son loved the illustrations and the story was right on his level ( 4-5 year old). There actually is a religious end to the story, but considering the author, I thought God would be mentioned more."
5,Love decorating with wallpaper? Buy this book.,"I love color, pattern, and wallpaper. (Have you ever tried to find a book that shows rooms decorated with wallpaper and tells you how to decorate with them? They don't exist.) Until I saw this book (by accident at the book store), I could not find a book that gave me this much information on how to decorate the way I like to. (I like to start a project at the wallpaper store). This is a breath of fresh air."
5,Absolutely excellent!,"The best and most helpful book--to date--on the subject of decorating; how to determine your personal style; how to discover your color preferences, etc. Exceptional!"
3,Inexpensive,"The charger came before the estimated shipping date, and so far it works. The cable is VERY small, unlike the picture, so it could make for some uncomfortable gaming if you play while charging in a large vehicle where the outlets arent close to your seat. Otherwise, it was cheap and it works so far."
5,PSP charger,"Charger comes in handy for my son during long drives, he loves it. Good qulaity, shipped fast."
3,PSP charger,it took longer than i expected for it to come through but overall it was worth it because it was inexpensive and it works
4,It's a really well organized book!,I really liked some of the poetry in this book.It has Sherman Alexi's and Leslie Marmon Silko's poems and other famous Native American writers' stories.I definitely recommend people who want to study about Native Americans' literature.
4,Never mind the ghosts...,"If I had known in advance that ""Judge"" featured a ghost in a leading role - and described not a small number of dreams along the way - I would never have bought it. Ghosts are an awful waste of time, and I find the description of dreams in fiction as boring as I do in real life. But I would have missed out on a very good novel. The judge of the title is a rather wan character at best, so his alternate, ghost role suits him well... and the dreams - well, they pass as in the night. Here is another American novel with crisp, witty dialogue and excellent description. Nothing much happens, but that never worries me. Allen has a great flair for language. I understand how he and ""The New Yorker"" would gel. The novel has a broad range of characters and you need to be alert to sort out the various partners/children/friends from amongst the failed marriages/cohabitations. But this is an original, excellent story and I am glad I did not allow my prejudices to stop me from reading it."
3,Enjoyable,"I not sure why I like this novel, but I did. The story is about a judge in Kentucky named William Dupree who died in early 2001. Really, it's more about the people he left behind. His difficult to get along with wife, his sons who are unfocused and uncentered, their wives, childern and lovers. There is his cousin Louis and his much younger and handsome Mexican companion. Also Lucy, his clerk he was quite fond of. It's a gentle story of love, life and dealing with what life deals you. It's a story for patient people who don't need a lot of action and like to read about people and their complicated relationships."
2,Can't Do It,2 stars because the 100 (out of 300) pages I did read didn't make my skin crawl. Reading a book about southern lives that aren't interesting is not my idea of entertainment. Slow and monotonous. After two tries it is officially off the night stand and in the box going to the charity shop.
3,"Could have been much, much better","I'm a dictionary junkie, especially those that delve into etymologies and usages. Who better to compile a speculative dictionary of terms on the edge of societal evolution than Popcorn -- whose name I've always loved. As a marketing guru, she has a pretty good record -- not perfect, but good -- of identifying up-and-coming trends; _The Popcorn Report_, now more than a decade old, is still a valuable look at a likely future. And there are any number of interesting trends identified in this volume -- like ""wind farms"" and ""the death divide"" and ""starter castles"" -- that have solidified just in the past few years. Though the actual pop phrases may have turned out differently, like ""McMansions"" instead of the third example above. Still, this book isn't as fascinating as it ought to be. It's rather dry and nerveless with very little of Popcorn's usual brio."
2,Very Short Shelf-Life,"To keep it current this book would have made a better ongoing periodical. Popcorn must reside in a bubble, many of these terms and phrases were created out of whole cloth and just plain silly. I doubt the library will even carry this book as it will be outdated in short order."
2,No Good,"After reading this book cover to cover I finished with a vague understanding of the concepts of electricity, almost no understanding of components, and absolutely no understanding of any of the projects or circuits it showed. He will go over certain concepts endlessly (like what a soldering iron is, or how a switch works) but then will leave transistors, diodes, and capacitors to be explained in a paragraph. I had to clarify everything with my own research, I am getting a different book."
3,Skips from very basic to quite complicated,"This book starts out with a well written introduction on different type of electronic components and how voltage etc... works, most of it is however covered in highschool physics. Then it howeverskips to semi complicated circuits with bad explanations on how they work. In my opinion the author should rather have described a few circuits in detail instead of many breifly, this would have given the reader a a much clearer understanding of electronics and circuitry. Overall im dissapointed."
1,Nothing here for me,I hated this book. It is vague and broad and won't tell you much you need to know. The cute jokey style is a weak attempt to demystify when some insightful writing would serve much better.
2,still looking for best entry level electronics book,I truly am the target audience for this book - a novice.The problem with this book - the author is not thinking of the beginner. He jumps in and starts refering to components before explaining what each component is.You don't teach reading before you teach the alphabet.Sometimes a book needs to be edited by a novice and not an expert.
5,Finally I Understand Electronics!,"I've played around with gadgets for a while, but I wanted to get more serious about learning electronics. This book was just what I needed. It makes concepts simple to understand with clear explanations, while giving practical advice about things like safety, stocking your electronics workbench, and soldering. With a relaxed writing style and helpful analogies and examples, this book is very easy to read. The projects chapters got me building some cool electronics gadgets right away. If you're interested in electronics, buy this book!"
3,"Excellent for beginners, but...","I am currently studying for a degree in electrical/electronic engineering and would suggest to anyone in the same situation NOT to purchase this book. The information is simply too basic. I would advise someone who wants a more indepth knowledge of the subject matter to buy ""A Practical Introduction to Electronic Circuits""- by Martin Hartley Jones.I should have guessed with a name like ""for Dummies"", but anyhow it is an excellent beginners guide to electronics and the practical exercises are very good."
3,No much to do with Halloween,"As far as receiving it on time and coming as promised .. it did.. I bought the DVD used and one of the episodes stalls because of a scratch on the DVD; however, the company made good on the defect. The episodes were a little disappointing though as there is only one (Operation Tricky: Codename Kids Next Door) that has anything to do with Halloween. I was hoping someone would be smart enough to make a DVD like this and put actual cartoons in relation to the holiday on it, like ... Ed, Edd n Eddy's ""Boo Ha Ha"" Halloween episode. If you are just looking for a DVD with a variety of cartoons on it, then this is a good choice, but as I said it could have had a better selection."
5,It's got Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.,I only bought it to see the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy. I wish Amazon would sell more Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy seasons.
2,Misrepresented,THis came up when I asked for Hindu chants. These are not Sanskrit chants although the title gives the impression of an Indian name. With the exception of one Shiva chant these are all Christian prayers.
4,"Thrash album from 1991, not a sellout album","This album is really good. It's not like the first 3 Coroner albums but still really good. There is one thing that bugs me though. Semtex Revolution's main riff is a lower rip off of the heavy riff in Metallica's ""One"". The riff that goesD| 2 2 3A| 2 2 3E|000000 000000 000 I dont get why they did that. They are creative enough to make their own riffs. Anyway this album is worth getting because of the other 6 songs and the other riffs in Semtex Revolution. I recommend the first three albums over this one though."
2,Could have been better,"First off, not all of the bands are Norwegian or even black metal. It started out with some useful information, but then then there were just some dragged out clips of live shows. The guy who made this also makes some of the worst ""horror"" movies I've ever seen, and not in the good way."
1,It's fake!,"This product is advertised with a misleading image and title. The image does not match the product. This is not ""Enya"". It's junk and who this artist ""Neoera"" is we just don't know."
1,Fake! Fake! Fake!,"THANK YOU REVIEWERS!! I was doing a lot of Christmas shopping on Amazon and found I was behind on my Enya collection. So I purchased several CD's and put this one on my Wish List as well. We all know Enya and even though there is a lot of duplication of songs on her albums...ah...so what. Who can have too much of a good thing? Anyway, the songs listed on the samplers above were familiar so I almost clicked on ""purchase""...till my eye caught some of your reviews with the heads up. This is one time when the product reviews really saved me from a bad choice. It's such a hassle to return stuff. Please know that reviews from savvy people like you make life a tiny bit easier."
3,Not really Enya,When I bought this cd I didn't realize that it wasn't really Enya singing. It is a tribute to her. I was disappointed and I ended up giving it to someone else. Hopefully they enjoyed it.
1,THIS IS PURE JUNK,"This is sad, this comes to show how many other musicians admire Enya's work but destroy beautiful compositions when they try to copy her....This CD is not worth to be out in the market.... IT'S JUST TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE!!!!"
3,TV Guide:50's Greatest Sci Fi Shows,"TV Guide Presents...the best in family entertainment! These popular TV shows have been specially selected for your enjoyment. There are 18 episodes for under $10.00!Featuring:One Step BeyondRocky Jones, Space RangerFlash Gordon"
3,Not for 1 person office,I am a single person business and some of the ideas are a bit far fetched for a very small business. Book does have good information and I enjoyed reading it. Gets you thinking!
1,AN OLD DOG WITH OLD TRICKS,"I can't believe how many people are gushing over this stupid book. i've gone through half of it already and i have yet to come across a single ORIGINAL and INNOVATIVE idea. i bet the author must be 70 years old. the author has not shared anything NEW. how can somebody who's involved in promotions rely on such OLD AND ALREADY RENOWNED TRICKS? i bet that most of the reviewers here who gave her questionable 5 stars are either friends, relatives, or part of her so-called glorified network. Someone has to tell the truth and that is me! THIS BOOK IS A WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,101 Ways to improve this book,"Well, not 101, but...1. Come up with original, fresh ideas2. Don't assume your customers have no taste or are stupid. My customers are intelligent, I treat them as such.3. Not everyone is entirely focussed on customers in their local community. A large % of the tips are only suitable if your customers live in the same area as you do. Mine don't - this is the Internet age, I run a global business from my house.4. Make practical suggestions. There are so many tips in this book on what to put on your business card, I'll need an A4 card, and a very tasteless one at that, to implement them all. How about ""simplicity"".5. Not everyone lives in America. The ideas are very USA-centric.Summary: if you run a small retail-focussed business (perhaps 3 - 10 employees) in a small to mid size US town, this is the book for you. If not...."
4,An Easy Read,"This book has some incredible tips, but some of them are pretty common sense. Still, this is a great read with proven results. I am working my way through the list, and so far many of them are working. The important thing is to pick and choose what tips are right for you and your business. I also liked Guerrilla PR by Michael Levine. Read both to be really well rounded."
5,Always within arm's reach!,"This book is one of only 10 or so that I keep within arm's reach at all times! I find something new and useful whenever I open it. Two years after buying it, I still have more than a dozen pages bookmarked with ""to do"" written on them.Particularly useful are the tips on using testimonials, referrals, thank-you letters and getting media publicity.This book is absolutely essential for any small- or home-based business owner."
5,EVERY PAGE OF YOUR BOOK WILL BE USEFUL TO ME!,I just completed reading 101 Ways to Promote Yourself! Wow!!! So much information packed in a small package at a small price. You are a Genius! Every page of your book will be useful for me. I can't believe that such a powerful resource has been available and I had the book for 3 months before I picked it up and began to read it. Shame on me!This is a treasure. Thanks for your generosity in providing such a great reference piece at such little cost.
2,21 out of 101,"Most of 101 ways to promote yourself comes off as filler. While all of these are ways to promote yourself, an individual would realistically be able to use 21 of them. The others seem to not apply, or are so obvious and logical. But Pinskey does cover alot of ground and as a reference to trigger some idea or things to thing about, it may still be worth the price."
4,An excellent reference book.,"This book is great for reference. It is not a ""sit down and read"" book. It is a big list of great ideas to promote yourself and what you are doing. The ideas are practical. The approach is easy to follow. I highly recommend this book. Add it to your library."
4,GREATTTTTTTTT,This book gave practical ways and very explicit ideas on how you can succeed. It gives clear cut down to earth examples about how you can put your best foot forward and actually do what the title says it is going to do!
3,GOOD IDEAS,"The book was much older than I realized. Even so, it contained some pretty good ideas on how to market yourself."
1,Not all ideas are wise!,"I just read this book and was very dissatisfied with its contents.The suggestions are not original and are not at all feasible for most people. For example...Ms. Pinskey recommends sending out audio tapes in a mass mailing. First of all, this is cost prohibitive. Second of all, a majority of cars these days do not even have cassette players, as she suggests.I was not impressed with the writing style and would not recommend this book to my friends."
3,memoirs of the american revolution,This is only one volume of a 2-volume set. This was not made known when I placed my order. I don't know wheter the other volume is available for order or not.
2,Sweet Justice,"Sonny Justice returns to her home town after her sister's suspicious death. Seems her sister was involved in some local corruption and wanted out when things got heavy. Leading to her partners to have her killed. Sonny puts together her former female fighting team from the military to avenge her sister's death, when the local authories seem to ignore what is going on. Sweet Justice is a simply average action flick, not horrible but not worth spending money to watch either. The cast includes: Finn Carter (Tremors), Marc Singer (The Beastmaster, Body Chemistry), and Kathleen Kinmont (Halloween 4, Fraternity Vacation)."
3,"Decent Game, But heres what it Lacks","1. No Season Mode: Even if they made a pointless season mode, it would still have been better than Nothing. 2. NO create a Boxer, which coulda' gave the game insane replay factor 3.No use of Money. 4. No upgrades to skills or experience 5. NO instant Kos: in most matches you have to knock the guy down 4-5 times to win, Even if You pummel the guy you wont get an instant KO. 6. The combos are kinda hard, so gameplay just turns into button smashing. If these things were present You would see Black and Bruised with the top sellers, maybe we'll get lucky in Black & Bruised 2, until then pick this one up off eBay"
4,Buy the Region 2 - Pal UNCUT Version!,"Catalina Larranaga and LoriDawn Messuri are gorgeous! Very sensual, with a good plot. The fact that the movie is one of very few ""Sundance"" selections makes it all the more interesting. Avoid the US release rated R and get the Region 2 - Pal Uncut Edition"
3,"Not the best, but a nice effort...","This would be one of the weaker installments of the Smurf video collection. The plot lacks logic. I bought this one at a garage sail. Smurfette was spectacular, as always. Papa gave a mesmerizing performance, and Clumsy...CLUMSIER THAN EVER! See it only if you are in dire need of a ""smurf quench"" for your ""smurfy appetite""! Smurf to the video rental and smurf this video!!!"
5,The Choctaw before Removal,"I enjoyed this book very much. Seems to be accurate, more so than history books in our schools. Enjoyed reading about some of my ancestors. Would recommend for people who like Native American History."
2,Tries Hard to Cover Everything,"A significant proportion of this book is dedicated to producing well presented listings. Easy HTML for ebay does a far better job of covering the same ground. There are also alot of quick tips that are easy to apply (and have been better covered in books such as ebay hacks).Most of the software packages on the CD are trial versions. Nothing innovative or new is included.The descriptions of the ebay sandbox and API are very superficial - enough to get you started but little else. The chapter on office development tells you that ""serious""experience is required and little information is availible from the ebay development site and advises the reader to concentrate on PHP - not bad advice but it takes 7 pages to get there.Conclusion: the scope of the book is overambitious. It results in a good description of how to prepare listings, some useful tips and a superficial introduction to the ebay API."
2,Comment by US diplomat below is suspicious,"If you go to the other French products by Language Dynamics, you will find the same comment left by this so-called former diplomat below. So watch out!"
1,Where is the book?,"I bought the cassettes which were fair, but there are frequent recorded references to a textbook such as ""You are now on page six"". The book was not included in the package. I e-mailed Language Dynamics about the book clearly stating that I was willing to pay extra for the textbook if neccesary. They never replied. Some people may say that you don't need the book. I would like to look at the words so I would recognize them in print. Besides, saying ""you are on page six"" without giving any information on how to get the book is bad service."
1,Misleading Product Description - Beware,"The Adapter does not fit standard 3/4"" (inside diameter) downrods. If you have a 3/4"" i.d. downrod, look elsewhere. The description does not reveal that the adapter is an odd (not typical) size. I found out the hard way, paid shipping and would have to pay shipping again to return it, so it wasn't worth the time, money, effort and aggravation. An accurate and complete description would avoid wasting time and money."
5,canopy,Worked great for our 45 degree vaulted ceiling. Well built. Amazon got it to us quicker than our local lighting shop ever would.
3,A good start...,"This is the debut album from NYC's U-Melt and it shows. It was recorded after the band had been together less than a year and the songs, while some are classic, some are forgettable.A few of these tracks are now concert staples for the band such as the blistering Schizophrenia, the Phishy Green Amber, and the proggy Through The Prism.However, if you are new to U-Melt, start with their latest ""Perfect World"" or 2006's ""The I's Mind""."
1,need more detail,"While this book uses simple techniques that are sound.I question some of the techniques, especially the ear slap when used by a smaller person against a lager person.This book also omits good technniques like the knife-hand .Nor does the book cover good aspects in self-defense like stance , how to train or blocking punches or kicks.Overrall this is a disappointing self- defense book"
4,Good Historical Narrative,Empires - Great Religions is a good historical narrative. I ordered the DVD's in order to gain some background and time references for the ancient Jews and early Christians. I also was interested in the development of Islam. The DVDs are historical and scholarly and therefore should not be purchased if you are looking for an action movie or using it for entertainment purposes only. In general I found this series to be a good overview of Christianity beginning with the ancient Jews and of Islam.
5,Watercraft Info that is a Must!,"This graphic and lengthy book tells it all with regard to boat safety, maneuverability, how-to-do, and what every sailor-navigator should know when out on the water. Excellent reference book as well. Very informative."
3,PTO 4,"I liked this game because I got to control the ships. If you are looking for a game that you comand the navy this is it. It's pritty easy, and doesn't have the best graphics, but you get to here poeple yelling, and ships blowing up. I would recommend you rent it before you buy it."
2,"Good protein, horrible taste","I tried these bars because they got good reviews on some sites I checked out. I was disappointed when they arrived and I tried one. The taste and texture of the bar are both awful. They were bland and bitter. The texture is like a dried out powerbar. There is good protein in the bar, and it is low in calories and fats, but this can't make up for the taste factor. I would look around more and find another bar to try, there are plenty of protein bars out there that have both good nutrition and good taste."
1,Bleack!,I'm not sure these are even food. One can only hope they are good for you as they taste positively awful. So many better and tastier protien choices are out there.
2,Ew,Somewhat palatable. I found a hair in one of these protein bars. Yes a human hair baked into the bar. Optimum nutrition made note of the lot numbers and gave me a free box of bars... all hair free.
1,Toy Story - doesn't work,"Doesn't work with the leappad exployer that I got. As advertized, was not clear that it wouldn't fit. I have it, but can't use it."
3,OK for intermediate level,"I just finished a course in which this textbook was used. I found that the descriptions started at a non-introductory level and were not in-depth enough. I also thought more graphics were needed to illustrate how and where the e- and h+ move during different regions of transistor operation.I bought R.F. Pierret's ""Semiconductor Device Fundamentals"" as a supplementary text and ended up reading and understanding that much more."
2,Badly written,"This book makes a poor job of explaining basic concepts. Let's face it, semi-conductors are hard conceptually to grasp at first so it is very important to present the theory in a very simple way in order for the reader to get a feel of how the different concepts relate to each other.Instead of that the authors throw math equations in your face right from the start and expect you to figure out how exactly these fit in the big picture. This is something I never understood from science authors. Why don't they explain the problem and the concepts first to give a first feel of what we're trying to achieve to the reader and then bring the math. I have nothing against math, in fact I love maths but they aren't the way to introduce a difficult topic. Just tell the story first."
2,Nebulous purpose,"I am a Senior in EE at the University of Florida, and I used this book in a semiconductor class. This book is too much for beginners, and too less for advanced students. They give some helpful equations, but they NEVER explain the concepts nicely. I essentially went through the course living off of equation sheets. Eventually, after using the same ones over and over, I started to undrestand what it was saying, but this book is useless in UNDERSTANDING the material, for it assumes you already know it."
2,Im a little worried,"I just finished reading chapter one. I know it is quite early to make judgements, but already I'm starting to feel uneasy. As someone who has always enjoyed physics and math(and done well) I feel a little more insight into what is trying to be explained would be great. Im a student at the authors institution so I think thats why we have to use this book. I agree with others that there is a lot of waisted commentary so far, but it may prove to be usefull later. It just seems like a lot is thrown into one chapter and doesn't really mix well. More time, or more explanation about what is trying to be explained would greatly benefit the first chapter."
2,Interesting and Nostalgic,"This DVD is an interesting collection of interviews and news footage. It's what you would expect. You will see a young Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill.The DVD is kind of choppy in its presentation, but the interviews are interesting and the look into the past is very nostalgic. I didn't know what to expect when I bought this, but I wasn't totally disappointed.The Star Wars fan will love it, but the general public...may get bored. There are no DVD Extras of note either."
2,Disappointing,"I found the DVD disappointing. The interviews are very short and superficial. Much of the DVD consists of narration about public reaction to the movies, incidents while people were waiting in line for tickets, etc. It is not very interesting or insightful. There is little substance about the movies themselves. I am sorry I bought this DVD."
1,Low budget trash filled with logos.,"I knew I was in a bit of trouble when I heard a rattle in my Amazon box. It turned out that the DVD packaging was poorly done and the DVD had popped out of its holder. Not a good sign!Anyway, this low budget piece of schlock had a logo nearly constantly on the screen.Who wants to pay to see a logo? Not me!"
5,A GOOD MOVIE FOR THE FANS,RELLY GOOD MOVIE FOR THE FANS AND ALL STAR-WARS LOVERS YOU REALY GET TO KNOW THE CAST AFTER YOU SEE IT.
3,... vintage...,"The 3 stars are just for the vintage interviews with the original cast. Something you don't see every day and with the charm of old and belovedly used video tapes. It's like a self cut amateur video of collected bits and pieces... and that gives you a warm feeling. The rest ... well, watch it once and then forget it!"
3,Nothing great.,"It was interesting in all, but it's not something that's a must have for Star Wars fans. I guess they figured that if you put something with the name Star Wars on DVD, they'll be happy for the next 6 years. Since I bought the DVD player, I have only bought DVD's. VHS is the past, DVD is the future. The Matrix did a great job with it, so did other movies. I guess Lucas is trying to keep VHS alive as long as possible. He must love it."
1,everything a star wars nut could ever want..i'm not a nut,"my friend has this thing on dvd and i played around with it. star wars has just sunken down to star treks level. really, this is the lamest idea for a dvd! this looks like a video you would see for sale on TV at 3 in the morning. and with the delay of star wars dvd until the all the movies are complete is dumb, what happens if george lucas dies? i still can't believe this was put on dvd and THX-1138 wasent. just unbelievable"
1,I put this horrid DVD in my trash can where it belongs!,I started to watch this piece of garbage and noticed that the interviewer did not seem very interesting and that the picture quality and sound quality didn't seem very good. I could have lived with this since there is no other Star Wars material on DVD.Then I noticed a logo in the lower right hand corner. I don't want to see logos on my DVDs! So into the trash the DVD went.
3,"I know you won't like this,Star Wars Fans.","I bet you're mad how I always bring Lord of the Rings into comparision with Star Wars BUT I CAN""T HELP IT!! Lord of the Rings actors and actresses will someday be put into a book like this.Hopefully they won't end up don't voices for cartoons like Mark Hamill.Viggio Mortenson and Orlando Bloom don't seem like they are sharing that fate.Another thing:I sooo love Peter Jackson doing all three movies at the same time.It's okay for Star Wars(Though sometimes it seems like they don't act the same in Star Wars afterwards)Lordies guys have all had a easy time making it seem continus.After All They probaley felt they WERE almost Tolkiens characters.Now I know that Harrison Ford is a huge actor but still.I don't think I'm as interested in Star Wars guys."
5,Best of Harvey Girls,"I have become a Harvey Girl re-enactor with the El Paso Railroad Museum since January 2006, giving presentations & doing research. FAR FROM HOME is the main resource for Harvey Girl uniforms. Our number of re-enactors is increasing, so we now have begun monthly meetings to discuss scripts for presentations, costumes for the span of time periods that the Harvey Girls existed, along with participation in historical events with other groups covering a similar time period. In addition, we are collecting & exhibiting Fred Harvey dinnerware & Santa Fe Railway dinnerware & preparing/serving food samples from the HARVEY HOUSE COOKBOOK. Since I am a retired school teacher as of May 2005 & a nutritionist, this is a perfect retirement activity for me. Thank you Lesley for all that you have published on the Harvey Girls ! !"
5,Far from Home: West by Rail With the Harvey Girls Paper Dolls,"A large, well illustrated book, it has excellent drawings of several outfits worn at the time by both men and women with a good smattering of the parts and fabrics labeled. In between are pieces of the diary of one of th Harvey girls. A great read for an adut, a young boy and a young girl."
4,Pretty good stuff (for the right reader),"This trade collects the last 10 issues of Moore's run on Supreme. Unfortunately, the series was canceled before the storyline was properly concluded, but still this is an enjoyable read for superhero fans.Moore's Supreme series is basically an homage and parody of Superman- unlike the first ""Story of the Year"" storyline, though, ""Return"" has far fewer flashback stories-I actually enjoy the meticulous recreations of 50s and 60s-style stories, but I know it annoyed some readers. Also, the printing quality of Return is pretty good-unlike the first volumeI'm really more a fan of Moore's early work (Halo Jones, Miracleman and Watchmen). However, as a person who at least appreciates Superman, Supreme is a lot of fun. I certainly liked it a lot more than ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (both are period pieces, but Supreme has a more entertaining storyline)."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"More of some decent Supreme work. Alan Moore and company produce this homage to Superman, and offer some meta-commentary on the Superman character, and the Superman family, with some nifty flashback work.You could burn all the non-Moore Supreme work and I don't think anyone anywhere would miss it."
4,"Nice, but does not seem genuine","Nice watch, but does not come with manufacturer's warranty as described. And the fact that there is no international Seiko Warranty included makes me think it s not a ""real"" or not in original condition."
3,Intermatic HD A/C Timer #HB171C,"The timer works well enough, but you should be aware that it can only be programmed in intervals of 3 hours. For instance, I wanted the timer off between the hours of noon and 5:00 pm, but I couldn't do that. It had to be off between noon and 3:00, then either on or off from 3:00 to 6:00. I could leave it on from 6:00 pm to 9:00pm, but I couldn't automatically have it turn off at 8:00 pm if I wanted to. I hope that's clear. Otherwise, Intermatic timers are generally reliable and this one can handle the load of my A/C."
3,works okay but...,It works - however I bought it to turn on something that I need to use during a specific time each day and the entire week is on that small wheel. So it makes it very difficult to set something to turn on and off at a specific time each day.
3,Great for kids,"The DVD is actually pretty good for both kids and adults if you can get past his inability to finish a sentence and his arrogance in the first scene. It seems to be a low budget instructional video mostly aimed at kids but helpful for adults too. He uses children swimmers as teaching subjects, some of which are good swimmers that can actually demonstrate fairly well. Overall effective. Helped me improve my technique. I like his way of letting you know that his principals and methods are not the only way of doing it well and that each swimmer has individual technique that could be just as good as his."
3,More adult guidance needed...but fun,"We have 5 other leappad books and this one is-okay, mediocre. My 3 year-old loves Bob the Builder so I was a little disappointed that he needs quite a bit of guidance on this one as the directions are more complicated, whereas the other ones he is fully independent in doing them. However, leappad is a good company and their graphics and character voices are always fun and engaging."
4,leap pad,my now 4 year old son says this one is 'a bit of fun'. My friend's kids had broken the cartridge for one of their leap pad books so be aware. I think the Leap Pad system is terrific to stimulate little brains (it is also great to distract my son whilst he eats!)
3,Wee Jazzy,The 7 tracks ( of 18 ) written especially for the film by Alex Heffes make no further listening sense outside of the movie - they are very boring - but the other tracks are pretty good. I especially like 'Fever' by Jingo. By Jingo I wish there were more tracks by them! Also the goofy Afro Reaggie Jazz on Afro Disco Beat is good. I love the raw recording and energy of many of the songs 'Love is You' is great. I could though live without 'The Bonnie Banks O'Lock Lomond'
1,scratched cd,very disappointed that the cd was scratched and wont play without skipping. Would think that the cd would be checked prior to shipping.
3,Grazing In The Grass...Whre Is It.,"I was disappointed that ""Grazing In The Grass"" was left off the CD Soundtrack. Had the advertisement for the soundtrack alerted customers that the track was not included, I definitely would not have purchased it. Anyone want to buy my cd. A disappointed customer."
1,missing,"This book arrived on time. However, there is no CD. What am I suppose to do without CD? Although I have read book description( there should be CD), I could not see any CD in this package. useless.."
4,I quit good!!!!,"This book is quit good, however, there are few issues about ""General training module"".I think this kind of books,Cambridge IETLS: Examination papers, they should have more ""General training module""."
5,KSC .25g- great for upgraded airsoft guns,"These are very good quality BBs. Don't use these in cheap guns! They are heavier than .20g and .12g used in regular guns, but they work great in guns that are supposed to fire .25g. I use them in my Tokyo Marui VSR 10 GSpec, and I have no problems."
1,YUCK,"This color is so much darker than the picture shows. It's kind of a metallic copper/bronze/brown. I found this under ""Nude"" shades of lipstick, but it's way darker than a nude shade. I see that it can't be returned, so I guess I'll wait til after Christmas and see if I can exchange it at a Clinique counter."
4,good pictorial review of petroleum geology,"This book is a good pictorial review of not only petroleum geology but also of state of geology in the early 19th and 20th century. Its very surprising that the oil companies, even in the early, 1900s did not appreciate the utility of having a petroleum gelologist in their company. The book also tells and shows (in form of good B&W photos) the hardships the geologist had to undergo. The only problem with the book is that the events are not given in a chronological order therefore it difficult to understand the context in many of the instances. Surely, the book is worth a read for everybody in the oil industry. If not a read... it is worth taking a look at the photos. Then, they would really appreciate the works of early petroleum geologists."
2,Read the Paperback,"If you are interested in this book, also read the paperback version, published in 1979 by Berkley. It has a totally different ending. I suspect it is the original ending, since it is less optimistic than in the hardcover version. I can imagine the original publisher demanding a more ""upbeat"" conclusion."
3,"Good grinder, but not as stated !!!","Ad on Amazon said one gringing wheel and on wire wheel, not so. There was no wire wheel included. I have come to rely on Amazon, but they failed here..."
4,Yomega Brain Yoyo,This is a good starter yoyo I have enjoyed many hours using it. It has performed as expected. the auto retrieve helps a lot when sleeping.
5,fun toy,Fun toy to get the kids playing something that isn't on a tv screen! Can take it anywhere! It has the clutch system so beginners can use it too.
1,Disappointed,Fell apart after a few days and couldn't be put back together and still work as it had. I would not buy it again.
1,poor product,"Im not a yo yo expert but I can do the typical tricks. Had a yo yo like this when I was a kid and this is not the same product. wont sleep, tried to take it apart and fix it but no dice. Not worth your time. and definitely not a good buy."
3,yo yo not auto returen,My son wanted one that came back up on its own (we played with one before and have been looking for one since) - does not do that - comes up more easily - but not auto-return.
2,not what was advertised,"The Yomega Brain and Fireball Yo-Yo was advertised as two yo-yos packaged together, a good deal. Only the Brain was shipped. However, the seller did refund the shipping and blamed the misleading ad on Amazon."
3,Not 2 Yo-Yos,"Be aware, this is not a 2 Yo-Yo set. I received the Yomega Brain but not the Yomega Fireball. Since there is no model ""Brain and Fireball"" on Yomega's site, this appears to be a 2 Yo-Yo set. It is not. You will only receive a Yomega Brain. Fireball Yo-Yo apparently just a come-on."
1,Wait for Soul Calibur,I expected a much better game than was hyped. The controls are terrible and unresponsive. It is one of those games that give you more eye candy but the actual game play just really stinks. I am glad I didn't pay full price for this game otherwise I would be very ticked off. If you still want to buy it try to find it at a cheap price on this website.
2,Tao OW!,"The only interesting thing about this game is the ""visible damage"" as the fight goes on (clothes appearing to be slashed, limping of character) The sound bytes of this game isn't anything to write home about, can hardly make out any of the taunts and the background music can drive you nuts. Gamer friendly? Not at all, I had blisters on my fingers from playing this, good luck pulling off the combos too. And the screen shots are so choppy (as well as the fighting)suddenly changing direction that you mess up your combo flow (again, if you can even pull them off). Cute for about 15 mins, then you can put in your DOA3 or Soul Calibur and really play a fighting game."
4,Surprisingly good!!,"Previous reviews on the game kept me from purchsing this game. Unsuspectedly, I received it as a gift this x-mas, and it is better than I thought it would be. The only thing is that the voices sound weird, but not the music, the music is good it is the voices of the characters which sound echoed and like they are coming thourgh a metal tube. Other than that it is pretty decent game. I especially like the idea of the wounding and limb damage, which makes perfect sene for a fighting game. Still Mortal Kombat is way better."
4,Good but not great.,"The graphics for the game are terrific. The characters move fluidly during combat while executing various moves. However the general set of moves becomes old after you play for awhile. Once you find a couple of combos you just sit back and wait to unleash them. I like the Chi method for awarding special attacks. More characters would add a bonus as there are not enough in the game. Also, the mature rating must be for the physical violence. There isn't much blood and certainly no gore. Overall, I like Tekken on the PS2 better than Tao Feng for the Xbox. However, the game is still solid. You might want to rent it before you go out and buy it."
3,THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING GAME IS STILL KILLER INSTINCT,"IT HAS GOOD GRAPHICS, BUT ONLY 12 FIGHTERS, AND HALF ARE GIRLS. THAT KINDA STINKS. ITS GOT GOOD ATTENTION TO DETAIL, LIKE IF YOU KICK SOMEONE INTO THE WALL IT LEAVES A MARK. BUT THE BLOCKING STINKS. ITS COOL IF THE PERSON BLOCKS TOO MUCH THEIR ARM OR LEG WILL BREAK. ONLY 4 BUTTONS TO ATTACK, THAT STINKS. THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING GAME IS STILL KILLER INSTINCT BECAUSE OF COMBO BREAKERS, FINISHING MOVES, AND HIGH COMBOS. I THINK XBOX SOULD DO PART KI3!!!"
1,One of the worst fighting games I have ever played,"It is just too bad, good graphics and that is it, don't even think about buying it. It is just horrible."
2,Horrible. A triumph of form over content.,"Well, it's pretty.... and that's about it. Games like Tekken, Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter have risen the bar for fighting games, and Tao Feng falls woefully short of this standard.The gameplay is sluggish, clunky and shallow. The game revolves around string based, unbreakable combos and a limited aresenal of throws. Blocking is frustratingly difficult; I'm impressed that it's implemented so poorly, considering that the game uses the intuitive ""hold back on the joystick"" mechanic.Others have mentioned the irritating training mode, the cheating AI, the bland characters and the misleading advertising campaign.If you are looking for a good fighting game for your XBox, go with DOA, which has everything that Tao Feng is missing."
2,Be warned,"This game was startlingly mediocre. As someone who has been obsessed with the 2-D street fighter games (third strike, marvel v snk, marvel v capcom) and 3-D(tekken tag and virtua fighter 4)I was severely disappointed... The fighting system is severely lacking and there are only a few characters, mostly uninteresting ones. The graphics are good tho, and there aren't a lot of good fighting games for the xbox, which is why I gave it two stars instead of zero. Rent it first, because after about a week I'm ready to sell it-I've got Virtua Fighter 4 to play.P.S. I just got the Sims and it [is great]."
3,Not Bad But Not Great,I had this game when it first came out and paid the $50 so in the begining I was disappointed so I traded it in.Flash forward when ever this game came out to now I bought again because I got it cheap. I always thought the graphics was crazy but the game jus lacked in areas.I mean its not bad but it could of been a good fighter.I really think the dynamic mortal kombat duo should come together since the DC vs Mortal project borrowed some of Tao Feng's body damage feature and revamp this game.I'd most definatly but it!
2,Don't Watch This,This movie bills the beautiful Jennifer Burton as the star but she is more of a supporting actress. There are worse films in this genre but that is not a good reason to watch this one. I would recommend instead that you check our Jennifer Burton in Playtime and Jennifer Hammon in Allison is Watching. The original Emmanualle with Sylvia Kristel should also be purchased before considering this mediocre effort.
4,Watch this make you come back for more...,"Jennifier Burton is a bona-fide thespian. I seek to write her an e-mail and encourage her to extend her range of acting. She is the first petite body that I have ever liked. I am not old, but old enough to know that she is a unique women. She should have had more involvement with the ""peeping-jane than she did. The Dance routine of the peeper was so hot I turned it off because I was too embarassed to feel the way I was feeling. It's a very good B-movie. You know what to expect in a way, but this one is not silly at least. I wished it had actually got more invoved with the photographs that one of the co-stars was taking. I will buy it for the artistic themes if nothing else. Jennifer Burton is beyond words. Julia Roberts is overrated compared to Ms Burton!"
2,Musical Clock,We were very disappointed in the musical part of this clock. The sounds on 95% of the instruments don't sound like the real thing. We were going to give this to a young woman who teaches music but felt it would actually been embarrassing. The pictures on the face of the clock are great. My daughter has been playing the bassoon in concert band for over 6 years and really knows the instrument sounds and was horrified by the sounds that came from this clock.
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I found this game somewhat disappointing. This is the first time I have ever played a metal gear game and found it lacking. I found the star wars game bounty hunter, which is another shoot the place up game, longer, graphically more impressive and faster moving."
4,Kick A$$ Game,This game is hot. You can hide under boxes and all that sh**. You can play as snake and other characters. This is a really fun game. You should get this sh**. This game kicks a$$.
4,Excellent Game,"This game is amazing. The story of Metal Gear games are always excellent at keeping you interested throughout the game. The game is different, however, than the other Metal Gear games. Most of the game is played with another charachter. Not Snake. Though this charachter is pretty cool also, he isn't the same as Solid Snake. I recomend you get this game. Even when you have beaten it, there are bonous things you can get in the game. Like stelth camo, infinte ammo, and more."
5,Excellent tactical action.,"For those of you who havent played MGS2 yet, or have, and beat the game, there's no better time to get MGS2 Substance, which is a must have for any MGS2 fan. It features tons of new missions, an okay skateboarding mode, and a whole lot more. While the high price tag is a little questionable, players who truly appreciate the game will have gotten their moneys worth."
4,"Good update to MGS2:""Sons of Liberty"" but RARE!","If you don`t have MGS2:Sons Of Liberty and want to play MGS2,just go for this one;Substance,afterall it contains the entire Sons Of Liberty game along with a couple of extras:Here is what you get if you buy MGS2:Substance :*Entire ""Sons Of Liberty"" game(main game)-rated 9/10*VR Missions(digital-style mini-missions)-7/10*Snake Tales(All the games boss fights which star Solid Snake)-7/10*SNAKEboarding mode(Raiden/Snake on a skateboard)-7/10Its a good update and all,But its nowhere near as good as Metal Gear Solid 3:Snake Eater`s update ""Subsistence"" as you get much more worthy contents,the main game ""Snake Eater"" has a new low angle 3D camera,MG1 and MG2,Online play,secret theater and demo theater modes-all for only 30$.Only buy Substance if you don`t own MGS2,if you own Sons Of Liberty,than you can live without Substance.Need I say more?"

2,My toes thank me for not wearing them anymore,I bought these thinking that My feet have found their savior but I was wrong.I only wore them only 3 times and couldnt take it any longer resulting to wearing the old Eastons. These shoes were stiff and provided little to no cushion support inside the shoe. The tip of the shoes bent wrong on the right side and would grind into my toes everytime i sprint. I still had to wear arch support (hoping that since they are New Balances it would have had better support) but it did not. I'm going to attempt to wear out the leather so that the shoes a little more flexible but as of now its unwearable.... As with any shoes the best way is to wear them first..They could have been good shoes but the lack of inside comfort and support really made these cleats unwearable for me. I hope you will have better luck.
1,"It worked great, then it went out with no apparent reason!","Orig Review: I uploaded the pictures you see here mounted on a S&W; 22a. I took the pictures right after mounting the scope. I held off writing a review after I shot the pistol. The mount is solid, you have to use 5/8 mount. If it is set at 3/8 you have to remove the screws that hold the clamps together, and flip them to the 5/8 to make them fit your S&W; 22a. It seems to hold a good zero. I'm no pistol expert, but I can shoot quarter sized groups with the S&W22a; at 15 yards, resting the pistol on the shooting table of course.Update 11/02/2011: BSA Red Dot stopped working! At first I thought it only needed new batteries. This is the second time I had to return the scope. The first one, FLAT OUT DID NOT WORK, out of the box! I'm beginning to think there is a flaw in the design. Fortunately, I was able to return the BSA, more like POS, red dot! I do not recommend!"
4,so far so good,Bought this red dot sight at cabelas for $20 (on sale). Have it mounted to my romanian ak47. The red dot scope has 11 different brightness settings. 1 being for low light ( night ) and 11 for day. I've gone outside and put this red dot on the 11 brightness setting and pointed it at very bright areas where the sun is giving off a glare and this red dot is very visible. Shows good against white. I have not field testsed this red dot sight yet and I'm crossing my fingers that it will do what its suppose to. It says SHOCK PROOF on the scope . So that is kinda easing the worries. As soon as I let off a couple hundred rounds I will post another review. One more thing.... this sights rail mount are 3/8 & 5/8. You can remove the screws and turn the scope rail mount upside down to receive 5/8.
1,Not worth time and effort to make it work,"BSA 30mm red dot scope that I purchased is an earlier model than one shown since it does not have sun shade. However it is same model and has same flaws as new ones. First discovery is that hardware does not fit properly without filing end of bracket slot from round to square to fit head of screw. If you do not do that, you will likely strip a screw and/or scope will not fit securely. Once that obstacle is overcome, you will discover some parallax and movement of red dot when lining up with target. Movement of your head while siting will cause movement of red dot without movement of weapon. Then there is issue of red dot intermittantly disappearing on occasion that can be remedied by turning it off and back on again. At least the last issue is not on newer versions of this model wich might make it worth 2 stars."
1,the rail mount screws became stripped after the first outing.,The rail mount screws became stripped when I hand tightened the scew to mount on my rail. I did not use any tools and used minimal and presure and tourqe. BSA did replace without any issue but this litterely sat in my drawer for a few weeks pretty much as a cool paper weight.
2,S&W 22A and BSA Red Dot,I liked the looks of this red dot on the S&W 22A as shown in the pictures so I bought it. Then when it arrived it wouldn't fit my gun which is the exact gun as shown in the pictures. Go figure...
3,works,"it's cheap but work's, good for use on small caliber rifles but dont use on a shotgun one shot and front lens blew out. have not had any problems when mounted on my cx4 9mm or my m4"
4,great sight for the money,i bought this and had no problems with this sight came on time and after zeroing it in on a ruger 10/22 i was shooting accurately at 40yrs with 1/2 in groupings benchedafter that i traded it for 2 new guns so i dont know how durable it is
3,Good price,The price was right but when I installed it on the shotgun one screw stripped out and when I shot the gun the scope was rocked loose. I am currently looking to replace the screws with better ones.
5,Awesome little red dot for the price,"I was looking for a red dot to put on my S&W 22A. This turned out to be a great product. Came as described, sturdy manufacturing and parts and bright red dot with a variety intensities for varying light conditions. It mounted up just right and has been great for plinking and squirrel/rabbit mitigation!!"
3,Un sure,Mounting system did not work for the rail on my gun so I was unable to use. cannot really give a full review so 3 stars just to be nuteral
5,High Value good sight,"Red dot is very clear, sighted in easily within 20-30 rounds. Very accurate, and allows quick target accusition. Fired over 500 rounds while looking through this sight and has not lost its zero"
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is the worst phone case I've ever owned. It wasn't expensive, but was still a complete waste of money!"
4,Design and Globalization,"In today's international marketplace designers cannot fashion their work to fit the cultural tastes of a particular country. The imagery, the color palette and the typographical arrangement must have global recognition. The authors of Cross-Cultural design have blazed the trail by presenting cogent examples of their craft that are lucid in concept, owe no allegiance to any nationality and have universal appeal."
5,Leprechauns and Ireland - A Great Treat,I have read this story to my third graders for the past few years and they absolutely love it. This is a great story for March. Use as an introduction to the folklore of leprechauns. This story keeps my students' attention until the last page.
5,A Bible for the Golf Course!,"If you golf, you must pick up this book! No question about it! This book will do for golfers what the 10 Commandments did for mankind!The rules are clear and leave no room for argument. I am looking forward to my Saturday golf outing to dazzle my buddies with my newfound expertise of the rules of the game!"
3,Some dated Golf Rules Plain and Simple,"This book does not cover all of the rules of golf, just some of them. And it refers to some changes in the rules coming in 2002; in other words, it's really ""some"" of the rules of golf as they were ten years ago."
5,All you need is in there!,"Hi,I'm from germany and I purchased this collection because in my opinion these are the best strategy games ever made!The german versions are not as goog as the english because there you have no blood and parts of the movies are cut!Playing Command & Conquer is a fascination I just can`t describe!Everything fits together: great music,cool sound effects,impressive cutscenes and thrilling missions...to sum it all up: it`s fun!!If somebody likes strategy games and doesn`t have these games he has to buy this compliation!"
5,The Best !,"These are the best games invented, filled with awesome, adventurous missions and multiplay. These games allow you to command your own army. As many men, tanks, trucks, artillery, apc's as you need, even subs and water transports ! Also packed with Air Warfare, with jets and planes and missiles, its just awesome ! Gotta get and have in your game collection or the best beggining of a new collection, its practically its own collection ! Trust Me You HAVE TO have this."
1,Be careful - this jar is tiny,"I ordered this product along with the Blackberry Body Scrub. This is a .4 ounce tiny jar which does not contain enough body butter for even one use for anyone except possibly a baby. Part of the fault was mine, as I misread this and thought it was a 4 ounce jar. Even so, I felt that I should warn potential purchasers. This is not worth $6.00."
5,Very cool movie,Very thought provoking. This very much had a 60's self examination feel to it. We are in a world out of control and the author looks for a future thru the wilderness. The soundtrack was great. The journey of a brilliant child thru a world lost was very cool. If you want to spend some time thinking and to open your mind give this one a try. Its not big budget. But it doesnt need it to tell the story. Very cool.
2,cat,"I actually purchased this vid for a friend who was the horse wrangler working on the set.The only scenes we look at are the ones with Lindy,the beautiful palomino horse,shot in Lake Mungo Australia,the rest of the movie isn't worth watching. Sure,there are some scenes shot in Maldon and Daylesford,Victoria but the storyline,(what storyline??)and the abysmal sound track are so disjointed as to be irritating,it doesn't flow at all. The acting is not good overall and amateurish,could have been a better movie with better editing and perhaps a real sense of compassion for the mental anguish that was central to the life of Kurt Cobain."
1,Dont' let Book of Eli reference fool you.,"Aaron, sorry the director’s cut was no help, sill not worth watching… I second not a happy camper’s review. No story line and terrible sound track."
1,Poor Performance,I purchased this product hoping to use it to inflate water tubes and towables for tubing with our bowrider boat. This inflator does not have the power to inflate a even a one person towable tube. I had to go back to my hand pump to do the job. It also doesn't come with any adaptors so you need to mail order the adaptors for $4.50 plus $5 S&H just to be able to use the product.
2,Well built but weak,I bought this to air up a lake float. It seems to be solidly built but has a weak fan motor. It is not good for anything that needs pressure.
3,"Superficial, yet Accessible","There is nothing wrong with this book. The photographs are adequate, yet some have been used before. All the necessary topics are covered. Unfortunately, for anyone who has previous familiarity with the subject, this book is not for you. If you are a junior high school student writing an essay on WWI, this book would be very useful as an introduction to that period's technology of war. If you have read many books on the subject, you might as well skip this one, as nothing particularly unusual is mentioned and you can read it in less than an hour."
2,"horribly lenthy, confusing and indirect","No liberal arts major can make this stuff out. Im a student who usualy gets As in math but this book is so roundabout and confusing i dont know what im looking at half of the time. It's examples are not clear at all and do not resemble the text questions well enough, the way the questions are set up, with writing, questions, then harder questions, really dont help and are plain tedius, annoying and confusing. Nothing about this book supports positive learning, you can read the example problems and everything else provided, then go to the questions and still have no clue what to do. If you must teach or enroll in this course with this book, find a really good teacher as thats the only way to find this material presented in a straightforward way. a bad time all around."
1,Masks of Black Africa,"I was disappointed in this book because I saw little or nothing in it that I could consider as true art. I think he simply took pictures of what little he could find and called it a book. Some of it is real ""trash can"" stuff."
5,MUST SEE,"The subtle passion of this film is remarkable. It is a Martinez tour de force - every movement on screen is full and rich. There are few films that are as romantic as this one. For any one who is a fan of Olivier Martinez this is a MUST SEE movie; For anyone new to Martinez, THIS is the one that shows you he is a true icon of sensuality and the ultimate in French film today.C'EST tres bon!"
5,The Chambermaid on the Titanic (VHS),"This was an excellent movie. I enjoyed the story, the music and the acting. Another wonderful performance by Olivier Martinez."
5,Fascinating and well played,"I really recommend you this movie. It is refreshing, and fascinating. It transports you constantly between reality and fantasy. A beautiful story. To be recommended!"
4,Fun Arcade style game!,"If you're looking for a real life boxing simulation game, then pass this. But if you just want some old fashioned slobberknocker fun, then this is for you! The conversation mode between rounds and Boxer's life mode give life to the characters being presented. The power-ups and different personalities are great too. In story mode, certain events happen and affects your match and gives certains weaknesses. Anyways, ya its a pretty good game."
1,Not impressed.,"I was not impressed at all with the controls of the game, while the graphics were great the controls are enough for me to pass on this one. If you like Mike Tyson's Punch Out then this game is for you, if you want realism stick with Knockout Kings."
1,Broken Right Out of the Box,"My daughter received this as a present and while we were excited about all the activities that the book is capable of, it doesn't help if the book never works. I don't know if it was the cartridge or the pencil, but the book does not recognize anything the pencil does and keeps repeating the initial book greeting over and over. After reading the other comments on this book, I've decided not to replace it. We'll wait until Leap Frog ""fixes"" the product line first."
2,poor quality but great idea.,"Just received one for my son's birthday. He loves it as he has a laptop like daddy. The quality is terrible, like another user's experience the right side of the device doesn't work properly and this is brand new. Apparently the sensors on the device don't line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side. I can't exchange it as I am not in the US so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are. This of course is very frustrating to a 3 yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff.Also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a 4 yr old. PS the box says for 4-8 yr olds vs Amazons text of less than 4 by the manufacturer."
1,Hasn't worked right yet!,"After replacing the first LeapPad that my daughter received as a gift I was very disappointed to find that the second has the same problems. When pressing the spot on the page you are suppose to with the stylus, the book does not recognize it or starts on a different page than we are working on. It seems to be calibrated incorrectly. I have tried it with and without the pencil to no avail. I will try one more LeapPad replacement and then go on to a more reliable and less frustrating learning toy!"
2,Never gets used,"My daughter begged for this in the store. She loves her Leapfrog videos and loves letters, books and writing so it seemed like a good choice and I got it for her without reading the reviews. She has had it 4 months and has played with it about twice. That is probably the worst dollar to playtime ratio we've had with any toy. She liked tracing the numbers a few times to make the bear laugh, looked at all the books once, didn't like how the books are read to her (kind of mechanical or robotic pacing) so abandoned them. She seemed like the ideal kid for this toy and it was just a total bust. I just read the reviews for the Leapster and I REALLY WISH I had read the reviews for both products before: I would have bought the Leapster instead and my daughter could have practiced her writing with crayons.I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because -- despite its total lack of interest -- the system worked just fine the two times it got used."
1,Get the original LeapPad instead,"Our family has the original LeapPad, and recently purchased a LeapPad Plus Writing. I must say that there is no comparison between the two products, and the original LeapPad system is by far superior. My kid love playing LeapPad, however the addition of a graphite pencil is a mess! Once the pages are written on, you can never get them completely clean, and also younger kids have a hard time erasing it all together. If we were to do it all over again, we would have purchased a second LeapPad system, and not bothered with the ""Plus Writing""."
3,I found a big error,"I was excited when my daughter sat down following her party to play with her LeapPad Plus writing. One of the first things we went to in the book was the alphabet page that also sings the alphabet song. When we got to the TUV which my daughter has trouble with it said G! I kept playing it over and over. It distintly sounds like ""gah"" instead of ""T"". I called customer service and I was told after being put on hold that they are aware of it but it is just the quality of the speaker that makes it sound that way. ""Is there any recourse?"" I asked. No they don't plan on doing anything in the near future. If I don't like it I can always bring it back. I was very upset that I thought this company would be exceptional especially when it involves such a big error.The door won't stay closed and it's brand new. Cheap pen too buy the way. They'd do better using a dry erase unstead of a pencil you have to order refills for. ..."
4,Great gift,My son loves this and he is learning things fast. I am so glad he has this and would consider this as a great gift for all children.
1,a real let down,"We bought this for our 4 1/2 year old and he was so excited! He is very intrested in reading and writing, but unfortunatly we are on our third unit that still doesn't work. It keeps asking you to touch go, but none of the units have recognized the stylis. In fact it doesn't seem to recognize the cartridges either. I guess we will give up and just have a disappointed preschooler. Great concept, but like many reviewers say just too many bugs!"
1,Don't buy this terrible piece of junk,"I just had to add my two cents. After playing with it for a week or so we put the thing away so we could save it for a long car trip. Well, when we got the thing back out for the trip it no longer recognizes any of the inputs with the stylus. Of course this was after the laughable 3 month warranty period was up. Wasn't I a sucker. The only value I got from the thing was getting out the screwdrivers with my little girls and playing the disassemble game. Hey, actually I did get about 15-20 screws for my collection. Save yourself the trouble. [...]"
1,Useless and frustrating,"My daughters each received the Leappad + writing system for Christmas. One of the units worked fine, while the other one has been replaced 3 times. I know have to go back to the store of purchase one more time. Like a lot of other people the pencil only seems to work on one side of the page, and it constantly refers to different pages that you are not on. My kids are frustrated and fed-up with the inconveniece of this product. I will not purchase another unit, and this is probably the last time I will use LeapFrog products."
2,Quality Issues,"I did a fair amount of looking around before purchasing this product. One of the reviews in Amazon questioned the quality of the leappad but Amazon had replaced a faulty unit and they were very happy.So far I have been shipped 2 faulty units, the problem in both cases being that the right hand side of the leappad NOT recognising the pen properly. This has proved to be very frustrating and a net educational drain on my 4-year-old.Thanks to Amazon to their responsiveness. I haven't given up on the product yet, it's a great idea in theory ... maybe I'll have some luck in August!"
1,Poor Quality,"We got this for our sons for a long road trip...and couldn't get it to work, it kept asking us to press the green go button...I tried new batteries and finally just returned it and exchanged it for a new one. I got the new one home and it would never recognize the page we were on. I've never had to write a bad review about a product, but this has been a major disappointment!!!! I had also bought the 'My first leappad' for our younger son and that worked okay, but would turn off in the middle of an activity...very frustrating. Nothing we press on the book is recognized by the leappad system. In the future I will consider buying other products and staying clear of the Leappad products."
1,VERY UNHAPPY,I am VERY UNHAPPY! I bought this product for my son for his 6th birthday. I gave him the product and he was very excited! We started playing with it and my son was very discouraged because the pencil was not working properly. He would be on page 3 and it would be talking about a different page. [...] If there is so many problems with the pencil then Leap Frog needs to do something to better it!
4,The stylus provided does not last,We got this 'toy' as a birthday gift for our 4 year old son. He enjoys playing with it. But the only problem we found is that the stylus stops working after some it. Nothing we press on the book is recognized by the leappad system. It continuously keeps telling us to press the Green Go button to get started regardless of what we press (even when we press the Go button). We have already exchanged it once. Even the second one seems to be having this same problem. I am just not very happy with the quality of this system.
1,Second unit and still not working,My wife has replaced it once and the second unit has the same problem. Unit asks to press the Go button and not recognizing it.
1,Stopped Working,"We bought the Leappad Plus Writing last Christmas for our 4 yr old. First off the pencil was not attached inside the pen and was easily lost. After 6 months of using it some, our son got more books and wanted to use it. I went to turn it on and it didn't work. Figured the batteries needed changed. Changed them and still didn't work. It angers me after what I paid."
3,Wish I had bought the Power Touch,"I should have bought the Power Touch for my 3year old. She knows the Blue's Clues and Dora characters. She has been really frustrated with the Leap Pad/Writing system.I hope that if they do produce other books, they will be more interesting than the current selections."
3,Very disapointed with this LeapPad,"My twins each received the LeapPad plus writing for Christmas and we haven't got them to work yet. The problem we are having sounds very simular to others that I have read. The right side appears to be functioning properly, but the left side seems to need calibration as it does not since the proper location of the stylis. There is no way to calibrate this unit. We have replaced both units and unfortunatly the new units are responding identically as the first two. I have been on the phone with LeapPad several times, and while they are very friendly they are not much help. We we be returning these units and going to a more reliable one, perhaps the original LeapPad."
2,cool toy but having problems,"I loved the leap pad for my 7 and 3 year old when we first got it....my 7 year old was having problems with reading and writting and this seemed to help, and my 3 year old was learning alot from it. I am very diappointed that it is not working now however. I really think it is the pen that we are having problems with and I wonder is some of the other people's problem is that too. I have looked everywhere for a replacement pen for this leap pad and can not find it. By the way the regular leap pad replacement pen will not work(thought I would try it so they could still read the book even if they couldn't write). This is a real disappointment as I spent alot of money on the system not to mention bought about 15 books to go with it and now it is useless. I would highly suggest another one of the leapads instaedof this one till they get the bugs worked out."
1,Buy the Quantum Pad...please,"I purchased this LeapPad Plus Writing for my son about 18 months ago. It was GREAT for the first year we had it. Then, all of a sudden, the Pen stopped responding. Changed the batteries and it would work for a bit, then stop again. I finally started hunting around for a replacement pen and could not find one for this pad. They have them for the ""regular"" Leap Pads. Finally, I had to break down and purchase a whole new pad and lo and behold, we've had it for ~1 month and the pen has stopped responding. The concept of the writing is absolutely wonderful, but find a different way to get your child excited about learning to write. We have a Quantum Pad that is about 19 months old and it still works beatifully! Avoid this Leap Pad Plus if you can!"
2,leap frog,"Ordered this leap frog because my grand daughter's leap pad didn't work anymore. This one did not work will, either. The seller was very understanding and returned my payment."
3,Customer Service will not answer,"My son got the Leappad plus writing for Christmas, and we really liked it till, I changed the batteries on day and the pen no longer recognized book. I tried calling customer service several times, left messages, sent e-mails, no one answered. I even called the customer service supervisor and left a message, still no answered. I hope someone can benefit from my review.ThanksLeapPad Plus Writing"
1,Reliability is 1 out of 10,"First: Amazon was outstanding with the warranty and customer service.Second: The 1st watch lasted for about 10 months and it just stopped working. Amazon tried to fix it and couldn't, so they sent me a brand new one. Then the 2nd watch lost all of its functionality except for the alarm, time, and chrono. You can make your own opinion, but from my experience and the price for this = GARBAGE!!!"
3,Great watch but not great size,"Watch was listed as having a 43mm case, but it is actually a good bit smaller. Watch and features are awesome. Touch sensitivity works great. Titanium is so light you almost don't know it is there. This watch would be highly recommended if it were a little larger. A strap and buckle would also give more flexibility in uses."
5,Tissot purchase,My son wanted a watch for xmas. We did some research and Amazon had the best price for the watch. It was the 11th hour and still got the watch super fast on time! The watch is excellent and my son was thrilled to bits! Thanks Amazon!
2,Wow - Service Sticker Shock!!!!,"I received by watch about 3 years ago. Paid about 500 for it. I was very pleased with it and the funcitionality until I sent it in for service. The thermometer was stuck at 99 degrees and as such figured it was time for service. I sent it to the location listed on their website and got the estimate back. Wow, what a shock. It was between $200 and $300 for service. Given that the watch was about 500 I find the service amount to be ridiculous. I have a Tag, Sector and various other high end watches. Never have I had to pay that much for service and the Tag is a $2,000 dollar watch!!! Needless to say I will not be having the watch serviced nor will I be buying a Tissot again."
3,Misleading title,"I have many of the same comments as the previous reviewers. The book's title is misleading, and really has very little to do with the history of professional baseball in Washington or its suburbs. Morever, this has to be one of the worst edited books I have ever read. I found several misspellings of proper names and several outright factual errors - and I wasn't even looking particularly close for either. Overall, the book was an interesting read, but I think it could have been better presented."
3,A Fossil of a Game.,"Remeber Qix? You get a big field where you move a little guy to swipe portions of this field while avoiding attacks. You do so until there is a small enough portion of field and then you get rated. Yeah... you remember, this game remembers too which is why they use it as the way you get new fossils.There's a decent selection of levels to choose form and a multitude of baddies to try to stop you from stealing the field (All giant bugs for some reason) making that portion of the game fun. Just like it was way back when.The problem arises when you try to use the dino battle system. It can be described as slightly more advanced than rock/paper/scissors. As a matter of fact it's so bad that if you really want to train little dinos for battles I'd pick up Fossil League DS Instead. It has level gains, exploration, and teams of dinos to train and battle.this is great for the Qix rip-off but leave it there, or at least try it first."
2,Dino master: Dig discover and dig,i am not completely thrilled bout this. the game is a lil hard. even harder without a instructional manual. which at the time i thought would atleast come with it.
5,"Gentle Giant is ""ALIVE""","On DVD folks! BBC Sight and Sound, Presents... Live from Hippodrome,London Jan.1978 A band that is either ""love 'em or hate 'em"" If you you are a prog lover as I am, then you are crazy to pass this up.

Give me a break! Perfomances are astounding as well as all the extras. A Must Have! Pete V."
1,Just a list of sources not good soild information,"For those of you who are looking for a book that will give you a lot of information about this condition this is not it. I found more information on the internet myself. It is just a lising of articles about peyronie's disease. I ordered the book and was disappointed, so I sent it back for a refund."
5,From Chump to Champ in Just Two Weeks,"My dong was sagging. It was so un-clintonesque that I was ashamed to let it wander at refined parties. This was a case of peyroneism at its worst -- a leftward deviation unparalleled in recent decades. Then I got the book. I read it and began to understand. Then I started to apply its wise, experience-driven, user-friendly stratagems. For the first few days, not much happened. Still the same old problem: a leftward-leading pencil, an embarrassment at party-time each Saturday night. THEN it worked. Things got better.... much better! The result? A perfect porker, the pride of the neighborhood. And, no longer a source of wry amusement for all the gang in class and at mass. How good is it? Folks, it's so good..... So awfully good.................. That I'm actually thinking of running for President! -- Blickstein"
3,"As with the PS2 version, this is not a good game.","Well, this port is slightly cleaned up. Graphics are sharper and control is mildly better. Otherwise, this is the same [stupid] game as before. Trick system is Tony Hawk based, but pulling off tricks is terrible. The focus is on combat, which is lame and useless. The mission objectives that have to be completed in the levels are some of the worst yet. They are very frustrating. Racing is not very good, thanks to a computer AI that always catches up to you. Pulling tricks is somewhat entertaining, but the fun goes away shortly. SSX and SSX TRICKY are much better games."
3,"ok, but not for larger pots","I guess if you have smaller pots, this would be fine; however, I think most of us have larger pots in our kitchen, and the shelves are not large enough, especially for ovals. we still put our french oven oval on it, but it does stick out. I guess it's good that this is designed for a corner, so it is out of the way. It's stable and relies on it being in the corner, but it is not that stable away from the corner."
2,Disappointed,"Paskesz Candy, Fizzers, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)I recently had Fizzer candies from the UK and bought these thinking they were like them. I was so excited to see a U.S. company had them because to purchase them from the UK the shipping is more than the candy. Unfortunately, they aren't the same, they remind me more of Smarties and while I like Smarties I can get them without ordering on-line. I wish there would have been a cheaper way to find out these weren't what I was looking for.If you need Kosher food item's these may be worth it but if you are looking for Fizzer candies don't bother."
4,Kosher candies/lactose free,"If you are looking for either kosher or totally dairy/lactose free candy, these are great."
5,Can't wait for the film,"I can just imagine Tom Cruise playing the Andrew Falcon (why not Will Smith ?) lead for the screenplay. A real page turner, and brilliant ending. READ ! The ""John Grisham"" of financial thrillers..."
2,A lot like Grisham - and that is not a compliment.,"If you like Grisham, you will like this. But I don't like Grisham and I did not like this.It seems to me that works of this sort offer up a plot that moves and not much else. No charaters, no style, no ambience.My preference is for well developed characters, dialogue that is more than plot points and a narrator that can find some subtle nuances. This is more like: Andrew Falcon was smart because he played good poker and the narrator says so. Winthrop is evil because he is manipulative and because the narrator says so. The girlfiend was true because she was a simpleton and the narrator says so. Where is the artistry in that?I also don't like cheap plot devices such as an ex-CIA operative who makes every dirty trick happen so easily. From what comic book did that come from?"
4,Good exciting book and a fast read,"The Takeover was the first ""Wallstreet"" thriller I've read and it was very enjoyable. It was very suspenseful, but some of the dialog seemed far-fetched and unbelievable, especially when the main character and his secretary are confronted by his business partner. For the most part is was a very entertaining book."
3,But Can I Really Recommend it?,"I had fun with the Take Over, but I don't know how strongly I can recommend it. Yes, its got all the elemets of a good thriller, but there are just so many other books that are so much better.Go read A Civil Action by Johnathan Harr, it's a much much better book."
4,Financial intrigue and presidential aspirations,"His name is Andrew Falcon ( we never learn his true name) and he is one of Wall Street's wiz kids. Falcon learns the ins and outs of investment banking, but decides to leave the street and pursue a dream. Un fortunately for Falcon he crosses the very powerful.Four years later Falcon become embroiled in a take over of the Penn mark chemical company. In a very short period of time he puts together a $35 billion take over deal. But things aren't quite right. He keeps running into hints and murmurs - the deal starts to fail the smell test.By the time Falcon figures out things are really going wrong, it is far too late to stop the financial machine from completing it's TAKE OVER.An interesting read. Frey paints conspiracy to control the fate of the Presidency with assassin bullets. Well worth the time."
4,"Fast-Paced ""The Takeover"" a Winner","Andrew Falcon is an average Wall Street investment bankerwho has just been handed a one million dollar bonus checkfrom his firm. This is not enough for Falcon, whoyearns for more. He immediately resigns from the firm.Through a series of apparent coincidences, he becomes the leadinvestment banker in the largest corporate takeover ever. ButFalcon learns that there is much more than meets the eye. Heuncovers a sinister plot to shatter the financial markets, andhis life.""The Takeover"" is a fast-paced thriller that has the appeal of a John Grisham novel."
2,A Shallow Story...,"Poor in intelligence, uncontrolled in its development, unmoving -- in short, a disappointing read."
2,The Firm meets Wall Street,"Disclaimer: I read this one in a hammock on a Mexican beach.Mr Frey obviously knows the economic world, and the story flows rapidly (with lots of twists and turns, never boring), but the writing was a bit stale, and the characters are stereotypical (hard to identify with any of them).The ending is no surprise - hero and girl on the beach the Caymans and all the bad guys either dead or in jail. Hmm . . . where have we seen that before?"
1,awfully trite plot and incompetent prose,"Where to begin? Decent premise. A Wall Street conspiracy wants to bring down the President of the United States because he intends to tax inheritances. The huge corporate takeover of the title is just a part of the scheme.But the twists and turns of the plot turn out to be both too complicated (taken as a whole) and too predictable(considered separately) -- you could see the punches coming a mile away.Also, the prose style is deadly, as if Frey's day job is writing prospectuses. At a singles bar, ""Falcon politely declines a buxom blond woman who asked him to dance. She was pretty, but his mind remained full of the beautiful girl with the dark eyes. He watched the blonde return to the dance floor as he brought the scotch to his lips. It was his sixth drink in the last three hours.""This guy even makes sex seem boring. That is bad prose!"
1,Very disappointing.,"Trite. Predictable. Poorly written.A fairly decent premise, but miserably written.The writer must have gone to Yale.I can't believe it was sold to a movie studio. The conspiracy stuff will only sell to the nuts.Also unrealistic on the money side. If he thinks people can be bought for such small sums, he's really nuts."
3,Suspenseful But Unrealistic Plot,"Ambitious investment banker Andrew Falcon is the prime character.Unfortunately, he is just not believable. Nor is the plot theme of a group of wealthy, influential men called The Sevens. They come up with a plan to ruin the liberal President of the U.S. by disrupting the financial markets. Falcon is kind of a pawn. But is to be compensated to the tune of $5 million for his efforts in their behalf by putting together the takeover of a large chemical company. Frey's books are usually good quick reading page turners. But, this one suffers the common problem of being just too far fetched."
2,Could be worse,"A friend recommended Frey so I checked two out from the library. This is not as bad as ""Silent Partner"" but has the same mechanical and unbelievable plotting, tiresome characters, evil old white men, and unremitting coincidence. It is irritatingly apparant that Mr. Frey has never been nearer to the world of finance than an ATM machine."
1,"Terrible, terrible!",My experience was totally different from the others listed here. I found the kit impossible to assemble--parts didn't fit together and the instructions were incomprehensible. This has to be the worst purchase I ever made from Amazon. A total waste.
1,Total disappointment,"The 2 reviews I read on this cabinet prior to ordering it gave it such good reviews that I went ahead and ordered it, even though I normally wouldn't order furniture online without seeing it first.Well, I was extremely disappointed when I opened the box. The quality on my cabinet is just awful. The leather panel has dried glue spots on it and there is a scuff on the leather on the front of one drawer. One drawer has the hole for the screw drilled at an angle and the knob won't stay on right.Both drawers have side panels that broke before they were even assembled and would have to be glued back together with wood glue before you could even attempt to put the thing together. The wood splinters very easily as well. Maybe I just got a dud, but I would not recommend this file cabinet."
2,file cabinet,The file cabinet arrived in good time but there were splits in 3 of the pieces. It was not easy to assemble as some of the numbers on the pieces were missing.
5,An Introduction to Clinical Laboratory Science,"I've found this book a good resource for developing training in Laboratory Science for Biomedical Electronic Technicians. Most new Technicians have extensive electro-mechanical background. Unfortunately, they are usually weak in the Clinical Chemistry area when new to the field. This book gives them a good background in Clinical Laboratory Science that is not written ""over their heads."""
4,An Informative and Interesting book,An Introduction to Clinical Laboratory Science is an excellent choice for those who are interested in the patient side of Clinical Laboratory Science. The case studies are a very effective way of learning about patient diagnosis and treatment. Overall it is a great introductory book too clinical science
1,Chocolate Peanut Butter,There is no peanut butter taste at all. This is the worst-tasting protein bar I have ever tried.
1,"too short, for kids","although somewhat entertaining, this video by no means is a ""behind the scenes"" expose of mr. wayne thiebaud. there is probably 6 to 8 minutes worth of video that shows thiebaud drawing. the video is less than a half hour long. there is a short enjoyable clip of matt groening drawing. but this video is not worth $15.00."
4,Little bit like Funki Porcini in Scotland,"It's a little bit rock, a little bit funk, a little bit folk and a whole lotta new age.I like this cd better than some of the others I have by them. It is instrumental only. I don't listen to this and dance around the kitchen. This is more background music for me. Good, not great. More like 3.5 stars.Now, if you have a chance to see them live, that's a whole new story, they rock live."
4,A lively fun New York comedy that's also tender and touching,"I first saw director Ramin Niami's film here in L.A. It reminded me so much of the fun and crazy times I used to have in downtown New York. (Times of love and lust and lots of laughs.) The performances from this large cast are a pleasure to watch and the film, while being a comedy, is also lyrical and touching. So many good actors -- Bai Ling, Peter Stormare, Ornella Muti -- taking on roles we normally don't see from them. I'm really glad I saw this film and can't wait to see it again on video."
1,Avoid this movie,"I rented this movie because of Ornella Muti. The story and the multiple characters seemed interesting in the beginning of the movie, and I thought that this would be a great film. But after the first 30 minutes, it became an AWFUL movie (lost its characters, lost its plots, and lost its meaning). Avoid this movie."
3,Five years old,"This book is interesting, and I do recommend the book. First, the text highlights some potential trends that we might observe in the future. These trends are focused on business, but there may be social impacts as well. Second, the text provides insights from a range of individuals who should know something about the world. There are two negatives. First, the book is already five years old (and that's since its publication--who knows how long the publisher worked the book). Second, the book includes many opinions due to the range of experts providing content. The reader must connect the dots."
5,Wireless Containment System provides more freedom for my Pet,"PetSafe's Wireless Containment System has increased my pets freedom to roam in the yard while keeping her safe from traffic on the road. The 90 degree circumference is a perfect expansion to the non-fenced area of our yard. This system allows our dog more freedom to play and explore outside without direct supervision while we're home. After training our pup with the PetSafe Yard and Park Training Collar, the addition of the Wireless Containment System took very little introduction time since our dog was already familiar with the tones. The system comes with 12"" high white flags to indicate the boundary area which were of no use to us here in snow country. Rather than staking the flags I simply packed a trail while holding the collar letting the tones indicate the perimeter of the boundary. Overall it's a great system with good directions and well worth the investment."
2,Range is severely limited,"In reading the documentation, you should be able to get 90 feet out of one of these, however it does state that if there are metal items near it, the range could be limited. They also tell you that you need to house it indoors. In our house, the garage is the best location, due to the shape of our yard, however being in the garage, the range was limited to just over 30 feet (on maximum setting). I returned it and will buy an in-ground wired system."
2,"Poor collar construction, once a year replacement","This system works well, when it works. We have two dogs, and have had this system for four years. The batteries in the collars are expensive and need to be replaced 4-5 times a year. The collars are fragile and we have had to replace them four times in four years at $75 a piece. We actually had to install a regular fence because the wireless fence is so inconsistent."
5,Job well done,"What can I say other than it works, it works,, it works! This wireless system works wonderful. We have a eight month old border collie that was getting out in the main road and this thing broke her from crossing the boundary that we chose for her. We did not want her ran over. It broke her the moment we set it up. She was hard headed about minding us but believe me, she minds this product. I worried a little about the battery expense but I have have used the original battery for three weeks and haven't had to change it yet. The batteries are not a worry because they are reasonably priced."
3,"Petsafe Wireless Containment System works, kind of...","The system is easy to hook up, but takes some time getting the field size the way you want it, unless you have a round yard. I don't like the fact that you have to buy Petsafe batteries, more expensive, but I have seem them in pets stores, Home Depot, and Lowes, so they are available. I put the collar on the dog and the dog got zapped at the low setting several times. The dog was then afraid to go into the yard. Gradually, the dog started going into the yard on its own. I noticed it was learning the locations of the flags. Then one day, the dog jumped the fence, left he yard, and ended up in a cage at the SPCA. I will increase the shock level and continue working with the dog. A work in progress..."
1,Terribly Inconsistent with Sloped Yards,"Reading the reviews, and the FAQ on the PetSafe website, it said that it should be fine with sloped or hilled yards. But, after purchasing it and working with it for a few hours, I found it to be terribly inconsistent on the hills, if not non-existent. The documentation suggests that you re-position the transmitter, but sometimes it's just not possible.If your yard is anything but flat, or a very gentle slope, DO NOT PURCHASE this item!"
2,Receivers stopped working after 1 year,"I've had my system for 2 years. The first year it worked great. I did find that the range fluctuated slightly from area to area but the dogs avoided going near the boundaries. After the first year, the collar stopped beeping but still administered a shock so it still worked. I bought a 2nd collar for $120 new. It worked for a year and then stopped beeping. Eventually the collar also stopped shocking. These collars have a lifetime warranty but after the first year you must pay $45 labor charge to have them fixed. I am now contemplating getting rid of the system and just putting up a fence. It may be cheaper in the long run."
3,PetSafe PIF 300 Wireless Pet Containment system,"It was received for Christmas and we have not tried it out yet.However, my real concern is that NO warranty card came with the shipment.Thus, I give it a 3 star rating."
5,Great Product,"I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas. Her bulldog, Brutis, would not stay in her yard! She followed the instructions, put out the flags, and put the collar on her pet. It only took one shock to him (on lowest setting). He learned that the beeping sound means to get back! He never goes beyond the flags now & she hardly ever turns his collar on anymore."
4,"Good product, easy to install","I am very satisfied with the PetSafe wireless fence. It is easy to install and my Labradoodle learned the ropes in two days. Now whenever Leo wants to go out, we just open the door. Best part easy to install and train the dog....if he/she is smart. The only downside is the range seems to be less than the 90 ft advertised. I do have rolling hills on my property and understand that can cause anomalies. Overall, after 2 weeks of use I am very satisfied and would recommend highly. Good luck!"
4,Should have bought one sooner!,"We had ours setup in less than an hour. We found that the easiest way to ease the dog into it was to put it on the lowest setting that worked, and let him figure out the boundaries. Once he is zapped a couple times the warning beep makes him stop in his tracks and turn around before he his zapped again! We purchased this unit to keep our dog out of the road in front of the house. With the proper placement of the base the boundary is now about 4 feet before the road. Now the dog doesn't go close to the road, and we don't have to worry about him getting hit by a car. VERY pleased with this product!My only beef about this product is the price. It should not cost near as much as it does for such a simple design. Given the result I do not regret the purchase, but hope to see the price come down in the future and maybe a little competition in the wireless dog fence market."
2,Don't know Yet,Received the unit in a reasonable amount of time but could not get the collar to fire. Called tech service and ran through all the test but still no signal to the color. Just received a replacment collar and will try it today.
2,sucks,"if your neighbor has any kind of fence what so ever, this will not work. It is not reliable and can not be trusted. if you want to return it they will dock you $40 or more without justification because their product is inferior."
2,WIRELESS PET FENCE,IF YOU HAVE A LONG AND NARROW LOT LIKE WE HAVE WITH NEIGHBORS ON EITHER SIDE THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FEASABLE.
