3,Great series BUT no subtitles,"Watch out! It is common knowledge that Will and Grace IS a GREAT series, but the dvds come WITHOUT subtitles, although they are mentionned on the box. It was a total disappointment for me and a total lack of consideration from the distributors."
5,Movie review,"I loved it. It was delivered fast, in excellent condition, and was inexpensive. I'm a HUGE fan of Will & Grace and Amazon.com."
2,Annoying,"Maybe this show appeals to some people, but to me the characters seem like a bunch of annoying, whiny retards. I can't stand the voices of the main actors - two of them shriek rather than talk. Rather than provide comedy that everybody can enjoy, Will & Grace revolves around cliches and gay sex jokes. Debra Messing is the only salvation in the show, but she's not enough to save bad comedy."
3,Package damaged,The Season 7 series of Will and Grace is wonderful. This product gets 3 stars because of the condition it was recieved in. The DVD box was crushed and slightly torn. This was a Christmas gifts so I was very dissappointed. Thank goodness she isn't a collector. The DVD's themselves weren't damaged.
3,The Kia Viper GTS,The Gold line of Bburago is the Kia Sephia of diecast cars and automobiles.1. The seats had broken off and were floating around the box.2. No brake rotors or calipers.3. The intake manifold is chrome...just like the real one.4. The shift boot has a molded tie string in the shape of a bow....and looks dumb.5. The tires dont fit on the front rims.6. There is a spare tire in the trunk.....huh?7. The dual stripes cut off at wierd places.8. The box it came in was amazing though.Poop for the price. This is a terrible Viper copy on steroids.
5,Works as advertied,Nicely finished with a very smooth and easy to clean surface. This board washes up very nice and is plenty large but easy to handle at clean up time and in the sink. Great Price!
2,Stick to the BOOS,Quality just not there as in the BOOS cutting board. I just recently purchased both. Did the advised prep with mineral oil and beeswax let it set over night.The Catskill grain is not as dense I guess as the BOOS. Parts of the board soaked up the oil so much I even reapplied. The Catskill if you look at it from an angle the grain is raised looks like the fuzz on a peach. And if you rub your hand across it its rough. I did my first slicing on it beef steak into strips and the knife left real aparent slices in it. I also used the BOOS to slice onion and garlic it left marks but not as much as the Catskills. I washed both up and the Catskill looks like it needs oiling again. The BOOS looks brand new. Catskills looks very pretty though from afar just beware of the different type of woods they use I guess- in my kitchen and mind stick with the BOOSUpdate little more than 2 weeks now after purchase the board is warped!! Nice
2,Ugh.,"I was expecting harp music. What I got was harp accompanied by synthesizer, complete with synth beats. Purists should look elsewhere."
5,Joel at his best...,"""Glass Houses"" is one of Billy Joel's best albums. It shows his wide range both as a singer and as a songwriter. He can do it all. This record included some controversial material such as ""Sometimes A Fantasy"" which is overtly about masturbation. It's a very personal record that conveys Billy Joel's most private thoughts and emotions in a period of his life when he was struggling.I really love the range of this record. We get some rollicking rock and roll with ""It's Still Rock and Roll To Me"", ""Close To The Borderline"" and ""You May Be Right"". We get the sweet and sentimental with ""I Don't Want To Be Alone"". We also get pain and loneliness in ""Sleeping With The Television On"", ""All For Leyna"", ""C'etait Toi (You Were The One"", and ""Through The Long Night"".This is truly a great album by a great artist at what may have been the apex of his creativity. I recommend it highly."
5,A Great Rock Album From A Unique Artist!!!,"I have heard that Billy Joel wanted to shatter his musical image as a Piano Balladeer so he wrote and released this album which proved he could really rock with the best of them.My favourite track would have to be ""All For Leayna"" which is about an adolescent pining away for a woman he had a sexual encounter with. Then Billy also sings""You Were The One"" which is a sad , wistful song about love gone wrong, sad and bad. ""Sleeping With The Televison On"" can be related to by anybody who has ever come home alone at 3.00 am after a party. Billy Joel Rocks!!!"
5,Bring on the '80's!!,"Billy crashes his way into the 1980's with this classic!! This CD has all the fire and passion you could want from a full force rocker. Songs like ""You May Be Right"", ""It's Still Rock and Roll To Me"" ""Sometimes a Fantasy"" and ""All For Leyna"" just flat out rock. I think it is a must have for any Billy fan or even fan of '80's style music. I think producer Phil Ramone did a great job bringing out the true Rock N' Roll feel on this album."
3,Billy Joel Rocks (Sort Of),"""Glass Houses"" is Billy Joel's hardest rocking album. Of course, that is really only by comparison to the rest of his recorded output. The album's focal point is the single ""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me,"" which doesn't actually rock much at all and is one of his most critically reviled songs. That said, the first half of ""Glass Houses"" is actually quite strong. Starting off with the edgy ""You May Be Right,"" it segues into the excellent ""Sometimes a Fanttasy"" and ""Don't Ask Me Why."" The peculiar twisted love song ""All for Leyna"" then follows ""It's Still Rock and Roll..."" at the end of the side. Side two is unfortunately weaker, with mostly filler material.Overall, ""Glass Houses"" is a spotty studio album from Billy Joel that starts strong and peters out toward the end."
4,Very Fun Album to Listen to!,"I'm alot younger then most of the reviewers, and let me say, I really liked this album! I randomly saw the lead single, ""Still Rock N Roll"" to me on VH1 Classic, and I wasn't too familiar with Billy Joel's transition into the pop realm. I thought it was very campy, but fun to listen to. I decided on purchasing the vinyl after I saw the very cool cover from the album. I finally got the chance to listen to this, and I really loved it. This is defiantly a Billy Joel album that's very upbeat and a little different from some of his bigger songs that I'm familiar with. I loved Still Rock N Roll To Me, Leyla, and Listening to the Television All Night Long. I wouldn't classify this album as to heavy, but its a great album! I would defiantly recommend this to any fan of pop music."
4,Improvement,"This replaced my original copy from The Piano Man which had some surface noise, ring wear, splitting, VG- condition. I sold it to a collector.Hearing it in this new condition was great. Really gave the whole album a new meaning."
5,just a fantasy,"Great cd , Dont understand why just a fantasy isnt on any box set or best of's. best song on lp. thanks"
4,Great tote bag!,"This is a quality tote bag, which I've been using for a few months now. The only negative thing I would say would be I wish it were a tad bigger--it's difficult to judge its size by the picture. But I am very pleased with my purchase and will continue to add pieces to the set."
3,Good,"A terrific collection that plumbs macabre depths while keeping a sense of humor. Dahl's style, apparently, is to stoke the engine until the train is roaring on the tracks, then, with little or no notice, have it crash spectactularly into a brick wall."
3,expected more on the grooming,While I don't mind having my schnauzer groomed by some one else I just don't like the amount of time others take and mobile grooming can be a little expensive. I wanted more on the section for clipping my pets hair and the section basically told me to have some one else do it.
3,I can get same information just anywhere.,"I was looking for just the knowlege for the very breed. However, this book offers nothing about it. I can get the same information online browsing."
3,Can Anyone Help Me?,"Can anyone tell me if this Book by Karla Rugh, is a better book to buy for the miniature schnauzers or ""the Essential Miniature Schnauzer"" by Ian Dunbar? Which one is the better buy for the buck of the two?"
4,Was a backup; now it is the primary,"So my wife is addicted to lattes. I purchased a nice pump expresso maker for christmas as our run-of the mill expresso maker had been used to the point of no return. As would have it, the new expresso maker broke after about 4 months. As a waited for the replacement parts to arrive, I purchased this coffee maker as a temporary replacement.Though the parts have arrived for the new expresso machine, we still use this machine. It is easy to use, produces a nice european coffee that, when mixed with a healthy amount of hot milk, produces a nice latte type drink. We use an expresso coffee roast with an expresso grind.Also, since this coffee maker is small and uses an external heat source, it will go with us on our camping trips. My only regret is that I didn't get the larger model.The only reason I gave it 4/5 stars is that the fit and finish are a little rough. I wish I had tried this machine before I purchased the expensive expresso maker."
5,I won't sleep tonight,I already had 3 pots of this wonderful expresso coffee. I used Chock Full O Nuts NY Blend and it came out great. The reviews of this Bialetti are right on. This is one great and simple expresso maker. I feel like Tony Soprano drinking this coffee LOL.
4,performed well but not enough,"Unit worked well and coffee was good, but does not make the 3 cups as advertised. Two cups is more like it. If you need more than 2 cups, buy the next larger size."
1,DOES NOT MAKE 3 2-oz. cups,"This is for the Bialetti 3-cup Expresso Maker - The one star is for incorrect advertising. Even by overfilling it as much as possible, I got a scant 4 oz. from this pot not 6 oz. as the description says. It makes a nice cup of coffee, but I'm returning it because I did not get what was advertised. I bought it because there are 3 of us and I want 3 2-oz. cups. Amazon needs to correct their writeup."
3,Too small,"This Bialetti Stovetop Percolator works well, but the 3-cup is more like one tiny cup. If you make coffee for more than yourself, get a bigger one. If it's for one person who doesn't drink much coffee, its perfect. The brand is great, and product makes great coffee. Just too small for my husband and I to only make one batch at a time."
1,Complete Junk,"The handle broke in under five minutes. The top didn't screw onto the bottom well at all; in fact, it leaked while I was trying to make espresso. The screw itself was rough and could cut you if you ran your finger along it. I never did get any espresso out of it. This item is complete junk."
5,I love this sooo much!,"I was so happy to finally be able to make espresso at home! I had owned espresso machines in the past, but I was was always left wanting more and always ended back at some chain coffeeshop. After years of searching, I have finally had a decent latte made at home. The Moka Express is so easy to use. Follow the directions, dont pack the espresso, and you will end up with great tasting coffee (assuming you use a decent brand of espresso and filtered water). Its a lightweight pot, with two chambers and a metal bottom. Seems quality enough to last through everyday use. Handle is plastic so make sure your flame is not to high. Also, is VERY hot when you finish brewing, so make sure to keep a pot holder handy. The three cupper makes the perfect amount of espresso for two people. Im so happy to say I am a reformed Starbucks addict. :D"
5,Replacements,"Great product, in fact the process is really simple. Keep in mind to buy some replacement gasketes, each one lasts arround 6 months to 1 year.Regards"
4,Get the bigger one!,"This is great - does exactly what it says it does, makes tasty coffee, and is easy to clean.However, please be advised: THIS IS AN ESPRESSO MAKER FOR ANTS.You will need one at least...three times larger.Seriously, go for the size up if you like coffee, or have at least one friend."
1,Handles will melt off even if you're careful,"I have a gas stove, I was careful and offset the pot so the handle was not over the open flame and the handle still melted off after a week. It is VERY small ""3 cup"" really means ""3 shots"". And you have to let it cool down before you can use it again. I am online looking for something different right now. Maybe an all metal version or possibly a stand alone electric version."
5,Coffee Maker,"This was the perfect answer to a fresh cup of decaf espresso. My husband drinks an entire pot of regular coffee every morning, but I must have decaf. With this little coffee maker, I can enjoy a fresh cup of my decaf espresso every day without having to have 2 large coffee makers sitting on the kitchen counter."
5,Simplicity can be beautiful!,"This makes great expresso quickly and without a lot of complicated ritual. Not much to go wrong with it, either, which is another difference between a stovetop expresso pot and the complicated electric versions. Its fantastic, not much else to be said except about size. The 3 cup size is small, go with a larger one if there are two or more coffee lovers in the household. Also, for the camping coffee connoisseur, this is a SMALL pot, it requires a little jiggling on a camp stove to arrange it so that the handle isn't over the flame and still is balanced and basically level and that is important! These also work beautifully on an electric stove."
5,Best Coffee Ever,"When I ordered the moka express, I was really excited to try it (I had read so many great things) but was also a little worried it might let me down, since I had my hopes up so high. It has not disappointed! It makes, hands down, the best coffee I've ever had. After the first day, I put my old drip coffee maker up and will never use it again. This moka express is wonderful"
5,Who needs a coffee shop when you have this!!!!,This really was the best purchase ever! Very easy to use and tastes amazing with regular ground coffee!! I only wish I'd bought a bigger one! Really I even bought decaf coffee to use this in the evenings!
3,"Works, but tends to spill at the sides when the water is bubbling up","My in-laws (who are from Italy) use this particular brand espresso maker, so I didn't hesitate when I bought it for my husband. It works, but water spits out of the sides when boiling up, so it gets a little messy. We do use it too often now because of this."
3,Handle Broke Off Within One Week,"I really like this type of stovetop espresso maker, and have used one before. I was somewhat disappointed with this one because the black handle that makes it easy to pick up the hot metal thing full of espresso and pour it into a mug broke very quickly--literally within a week of its arrival. I guess I could experiment with reattaching it, and I can still use the device with the careful help of an oven mitt, but I generally expect kitchenware to remain intact for longer than a week. I also thought that the particular model I was purchasing was going to be larger, though that is probably my own fault for failing to read the product specifications closely enough before pressing ""add to cart""."
1,Didn't work.,"I bought many different types and sizes of expresso machines. I decided to try the old standard stove top kind. This one did not work well, it leaked and I returned it. I bought one at Publix for $9.00 and it works GREAT!"
1,BAD,A week or two after I purchased it the internal part of the item started to change colors and the coffee prepared started to get bad taste. Absolutely disappointing.
2,To hard to figure out,"I did not like this product. I'm not aspiring to learn how to be a coffee expert. I tried this out a few times. It takes 5 mninutes or longer to boil the water. Its also a pain to clean and scrub. This is a good option for people who want to learn how to make a perfect espresso. A better option is to use the AeroPress coffee and espresso maker. It's real simple to use and worked beautifully the first time and tastes as good or beter than store bought espresso. You can buy this on Amazon.Put in the filter, add some coffee, add some hot water, stir, then press down in just a matter of seconds. Put this device over a coffee cup. Its real easy to clean."
2,3 cup bialetti,I don't really like this product. I have bought other espresso makers that are way better than this one. Than again it wasn't very expensive either.
4,Great tasting coffee and fun proces,Makes wonderful coffee via a fun and easy process. I love watching this thing work and the final product is always worth the short wait. I wish I had gone with the 6 cup but that is my own fault not the Moka pots. It's a well made product and I highly recommend it.
4,"Amazing Product, But Not New When I Received It","When I first received this item, there was oil residue from the coffee grind from a former owner who had made coffee before me. I could tell this was not a brand new product and was a little disappointed that I paid for the full price for it. I'm not going to make a big deal out of it because I don't have the time to do the whole exchange process. Plus the product itself works amazing, so I'm fine with it. Other than that, I make my own little cappuccino every morning and it makes my taste palette oh, so happy!"
5,Great Stovetop Espresso Maker,This is my first time using a stove top device and I was very pleased from the first try. I've always used several machines in the past and I think I will like this one.Pros:1) can make small shots with little effort2) easy to assemble3) fast4) easy clean upCons:1) Small on my ceramic cook top so excess heat escapes2) small (but this is also a pro)3) you have to keep an eye on it during the brew process4) no real creamy head on the shotI'm very happy with my purchase and I think you will enjoy it too!
5,Goood Coffee!,"Item performed as expected and was simple to use; also, my wife thought it was ""cute"". This is all I have to say."
3,"Decent, but leaks and handle melts","My home has a gas stove so the flames lick at the handle if not positioned correctly. A metal handle would get hot but that would be better than melted plastic. Further, it leaks sometimes when heating up and leaks sometimes when it violently discharges the coffee. However, the coffee it produces is high quality."
1,"Item received is cheap, poorly made knock off","The item I received is not a Bialetti, it has no Bialetti trademark or symbol and as the owner of several other Bialetti's over more than 40 years I know this is not a genuine Bialetti. It is made of flimsy metal and poorly machined. You will not get the real experience of stovetop style espresso from this item. It is simply awful."
4,The classic made small,"Bialetti Moka's are found in just about every Italian household. They are also an affordable way to get strong, espresso-like coffee. To get real espresso, you need a lot more pressure pushing the water through the finely ground coffee. In coffee speak, you need roughly 9 ""bars"" for proper espresso. Moka's have only 1.5 to 3 ""bars"" of pressure.Still, with warmed milk, it makes a decent morning drink. And the style is distinctive and attractive.One word of caution on the 3-cup: it really only makes enough for one person, and barely that if you like to fill a regular size travel mug.Otherwise, I highly recommend the Moka in general and the 3-cup in particular."
5,"Easy to use, great coffee","Quick and easy to use, no electricty required, easy for transport, and make a great coffee.100% recommendable for coffee lovers."
3,Get the larger size!,"I hesitated giving this a 3-star review because really, isn't it my fault that I didn't really think about the TINY volume this produced?Then I thought, Well maybe it is my fault. But! This little machine, as well as it works, produces only enough coffee to make one cappuccino at the most. And is there an actual market for a coffee machine that only makes about 3 oz of coffee at a time? I don't think so. I think most people actually want at *least* one full 8-oz cup of coffee, or even more. And it's a pain to empty and clean the coffee maker and do it all over again just to get that.Do yourself a favor: get the larger size!"
5,the best,Since living in Italy for 6 years no morning is complete without a shot or two of Italian esspresso. You must try
5,So Easy to Use - Great coffee,"I bought this to replace my Krups Espresso maker, I have had two Krups machines break on me. I use it every day for my Latte's. This seemed like a better option. It is just as fast, makes great coffee and I don't think I'll have the quality problems."
4,"Very good coffee maker, needs attention though","Overall I like this coffee maker. My only criticism is that it can be difficult to tell when the coffee is done. When it's done though, the coffee is quite good."
3,"Shots, Not Cups!","The product arrived in a timely manner, and there were no problems with condition. My only complaint is that this is a three-SHOT espresso maker, not a three-cup one. it is VERY small and probably will not hold 1, 8oz cup. My mistake due to semantics. I'll keep it and give it as a gift, but I've already ordered a 9 SHOT maker for myself."
3,Nice product but too small,This is a great kettle but the size was too small. Not enough for even one normal cup. i would suggest people to go for a size at least twice the volume. Otherwise the coffee is great tasting.
3,WRONG ITEM RECEIVED,"I ORDERED A 3 CUP STOVE TOP ESPRESSO MAKER..THE ONE I RECEIVED IS A TINY ""ONE"" CUP ESPRESSO MAKER.....NOT GOOD! PLEASE CONTACT ME ASAP TO MAKE AN EXCHANGE....SINCERELY...MS. G. KEFFER"
1,Do not buy...,It is not worth the $20 or what ever the current price may be. It gives a coffee plus metallic taste. It discolored after the first wash / use. I bought this particular one because there were way more positive reviews than negative ones but don't underestimate a negative review. You get what you pay for. Metal...
1,Aluminum toxicity,"There IS a steel counterpart! Note that coffee is a strong acid, and thus the Al binds to it (like rhubarb). Using these is almost certainly very very bad for you (although not yet proven). Please do not buy these aluminum pots! Spend $10-15 more. I have a Bialetti Musa and I love it (although I use my Toddy T2N more)Bialetti Musa: [...]Bialetti ""Percolator"": [...]"
5,Perfect,Excellent quality! So far I have been very happy with this product. It looks durable and I am hoping to enjoy it for a while.
5,Just like the one I had in Italy,"Makes never fail great espresso, cappuccino it is a good old friend. Easy to clean and store. I recommend it to everyone who loves espresso coffee"
4,Bialetti lives up to its reputationi!,"I love my little Bialettis! My little qualm is that the steam will sometimes escape if the top is not screwed on just right. This results in skimpy output. Should you try to tighten it using the handle (like when it's too hot to touch the top), it can easily break the handle, so don't try it!That's what I don't quite get--such a sturdy pot with such a puny handle. The materials are quite mismatched. I actually bought this one to replace the one I ruined when I mispositioned it on the stove and found the handle had melted, drooping over so sad. And such a shame the whole pot had to be discarded for such a minor incident! This is why is gets one star off from absolutely fabulous."
4,Good,"This espresso maker had good reviews, so I bought it in the 3-cup size, but I was concerned it might have a loud whistle like a friend's 3-cup espresso maker. Fortunately, that's not a problem, and it worked quite well. (He must have a different kind.) It was quiet and didn't splash out the top. I detected a slight ""rubber"" smell on opening the device, presumably from the gasket, but it didn't seem to affect the coffee and wasn't offensive. This seems well-made, particularly for the price, and I'm hoping it continues to serve well. (Bialetti's popularity seems to help when it comes to getting spare parts, too, like extra gaskets.) The basket seems to hold about 2 coffee scoops worth (or about 3-4 tablespoons?). I love Illy espresso, so that's what I'm using with it - about $15/can in a local grocery store."
2,Not Very Durable,"This makes good coffee, but after 17 months of use (about once a day) the water won't move out of the lower portion, indicating a malfunctioning valve. The cost for a replacement valve is $10 + $5 postage, almost the cost of a whole brand new one. I really think it should last longer."
2,cheap gasket,"you are better off buying a cheaper version from the dollar store.. Very poorly constructed for the price, gasket will not last very long and the Aluminum pits overnight... Ovente makes a stainless type that is much much better..."
4,Makes good esspresso,Perfect for making 3 cups of espresso. quick and easy cleanup. Perfect price very convenient. I would recommend this product for everyone who needs a simple espresso maker.
5,Stovetop type espresso maker,"This espresso maker is very easy to use, produces good espresso coffee without the effort involved in the more sophisticated espresso makers at a significantly lower cost. Highly recommended,"
1,Bollocks,"I found this book extremely outdated and generally very unhelpful, merely emphasising old stereotypes about child raising which I have personally found to be untrue. Do not recommend."
5,Great Value.,"I purchased these to go with a joist mounted pull-up bar. I almost went with a more expensive pair, but, I'm glad I didn't. Their quality has exceeded my expectations. Heavy duty and comfortable. Quick and easy to put up and take down. Most importantly, a great ab workout!"
3,AMAZON Buyer Beware -,"This item is sold by a 3rd party via Amazon. Please be aware that *something is wrong with Amazon's ordering system*.Instead of Ab Straps, you will receive a $30 container of energy drink mix from the Vitamin Shoppe. You will then have to return the incorrect item to the Vitamin Shoppe (which, btw, does not even stock Ab Straps), wait two weeks to get your money back, and lose out on your express shipment payment.Don't bother complaining to Amazon - the best you'll get is an insincere shrug (and no credit for your mis-used express shipment fee).This is just my experience - hopefully this will serve as a warning and help someone else out there ~"
2,dissapointed,"I purchased these with high hopes based on reviews but was greatly disappointed. First, the latch arrived with significant rust on it. Not sure if that affects anything other than asthetics but that sucks to see rust on a new item.As for functionality, I found that the straps would cause my body to swing during reverse crunches, especially if my legs are fully extended. I guess if you install it up against a wall it would solve that problem. However, I installed a pull-up bar in the garage away from the wall and I was hoping to use it with these ab straps. Now I only do pull-ups on the bar because the straps aren't worth the workout. Not anymore effective than other situp methods."
5,Great Product,"The Valeo Ab Straps arrived prompt and in perfect condition. The picture doesn't do them justice! They are made of what appears to be in-destructive THICK canvas type material with HUGE sturdy safety hook latches. Took me a few minutes to figure out where to place my arms, but once I began my work out, the Valeo Ab Straps allowed me to comfortably do many reps without hurting under my arms. I am however quite sore around my stomach! Exactly what I wanted!"
2,Great product (In theory),"I have only owned these ab straps for a week and after the first time I used them I notice the threads coming apart where the straps holds the hooks in place. It is only a matter of time before I fall and I don't like having to look at the straps every time I complete a set. These are great straps in theory, however, they are made very cheap, so you get what you pay for I suppose. If you value your life, depending on how high you're hanging, don't buy these straps and spend the extra money on something that's made to last."
4,Durable yet comfortable,Solid straps that perform exactly as they are supposed too. Large carabiners fit just about any size bar. Comfortable padding and durable material.
5,Valeo Ab Straps,Worth the money......I have been using these as a part of my workout since recv'ng them in November.Giving myself at least 2 days rest during the week and eating right is the key. I have already noticed results.
3,Nice home workout,"This AbStrap adds a welcomed mix to my home workout .. But your body swings as you dont have the back support that would be present in the vertical bench ... Ocne you can control your body, so as not to swing too much its a decent workout ..."
5,This Ab Straps are just perfect.,"This ab straps are just perfect. is easy to install and use, are comfortable, solid and secure. if you do it righ you can fell your abs working, knee raises can be one of the best ab exercises that you can do. totally recomended. this ab straps are also cheaper than others. dont look any further and buy this."
4,"Work Great, Nice Addition for my Home Gym",I wanted to do other types of abdominal exercises and I had a pull bar. These fit easily on my bar and seem very durable so far. They were not expensive and can be detached when not in use (but I usually just leave them up on the bar). My arms fit nicely inside the straps and are comfortable when doing my exercises.
5,Ab straps,Love it! Everything that I thought it would be. Arrived on time and was what I wanted. I am happy with the purchase.
5,"Valeo Ab straps - solid, secure and easy to install","I bought it from Amazon, installed it on my Iron Gym Workout Bar - Extreme Edition, and it works great.I've used it only once. This is based on my initial impression:Easy to installFeels Solid and SecureComfortableEasier exercise compared to crunches"
3,needs more depth and detail in certain areas,"Although clinical surgery its clearly written and well organized the content is rather lacking in depth and detail and the coverage of many topics is disstressingly superficial.I particularly noted:1.the abscence of comprehensive coverage of burns and peritonitis which are major topics on exams2.the dissapointingly concise coverage of shock which is also a major topic on exams3.the coverage of gastrectomy-vagotomy complications are in the form of a small box!!Even non surgery oriented textbooks such as davidson spent more space to cover this topic.Having said all that i would like to outline that clinical surgery has the foundations of a good textbook.The artwork (colour drawings,diagrams,pictures)is abundant, fascinating and extremely helpfull in the understanding of the various topics.The text is clear and easily understood .I particularly liked the 'practical procedures' chapter where basic practicall skills are taught-very helpfull!!"
2,not that great,"i was excited at first to get this shampoo and realized it wasn't that great after a few washings. It weighed down my hair, gave no shine, and i had hair breakage. the only reason, i am giving this shampoo 2 stars is because of the sweet scent and a little softness. overall, i would try something else actually worth the money."
4,Buckets of furry blood,"LOL ... funny flick. It does what it does well and I liked it ... ""oh the special effects are cheezy,"" those puppets said <- poor a bucket of blood on em! ""oh, the plot is ..."" <- don't let em finish and unleash the bunnies on them! The movie is a great time and the special effects and plot make it. I love it when stuff happens like the lab chasing a victim down and you can tell its a fun loving dog trying to follow. The squirrel rocked! Or the puppet animals attacking and the horribly good cgi. The plot has nice humor as well and its just as messed up as the effects and this is just fine by me. Good job to all involved in this film. I say get some popped corn with loads of salt and butter and watch it."
2,OMG!!!!!!,"This movie was all over the place. It had horrible graphic effects and the plot was lacking. It would have been better without so much of the crappy computer animations in it. The over acting took from the movie. However, it was hilarious in parts. I would have to say this should have been under horror/comedy sections rather than action."
1,straight garbage,"After infiltrating an all girl's slumber party in a remote cabin, Wolf, an awkward pizza delivery driver spends a passionate evening with a beautiful teen named Samantha. The next morning Samantha is gone, and the cabin in the woods is attacked by a family of deer. After a brutal massacre the cabin is bathed in the blood and gruesome remains of deer and teenage girl.

But is she worth it?it was just phony for 22 bucks glad i rent it"
4,Great...,"This book was great for learning the basics. Now that I have a better understanding of the origination, and occurances regarding the christian church over the years, I now feel better equipped to read a more thorough account of these happenings from another author. This book sets up a wonderful timeline of events throughout history and has a great way of presenting facts via various visual aids, such as pictures, charts, and subtitles... all in all, very user friendly. :)"
5,A Treasure,Timothy Jones' Christian History Made Easy not only handles a broad and difficult topic well but does it with a deepening interest. The book is easy to read and the treatment extremely even handed. The internet links alone make this book a must read for those who wish to get a broader and clearer view of vital historical material. The book is simply a treasure!
5,my Sunday school class is loving this!,"My adult Sunday school class is using this as a 13-week study with two of us sharing the load of presenting it. It's definately a fast track through Church history - for several weeks we took 100 years at a time and this past Sunday 400 years! As a seminary graduate, I took Church history courses and am just totally impressed with how the author presents the material in such a way that people can understand it, enjoy it, and grow from it. I highly recommend it as Sunday school material for youth and adults!"
5,excellent material for sunday school,"Jones does an excellent job in organizing the vast church history materials into a 13 weeks sunday school class. I used it for my sunday school class and find it very helpful. He uses page borders to mark out plainly key persons, events, concepts, and extra materials. All these are very helpful for lay persons who have no education of church history whatsoever, and gives teachers freedom in selecting his own focus. Strongly recommend!"
3,Church Sunday school reading,Requires considerable reference study. There is a video that connects with book and I found it good. Thank youDel
4,ben reviews christian history,I just started reading the book. Just through the first chapter. Using it for Sunday School lesson text. I am not the teacher. Like the pictures. It jumps out at you.
4,Well written. Enough information .,I really enjoyed it. I thought it made me realize the reason for so many different ways of looking for God. I would highly recommend anybody involved in ecumenical work to read it.
4,Seems Stout,"I have run a couple of ""unplug it from the wall"" tests while watching the UPS software (which provides information about power both in and out and remaining backup time) and felt comfortable with the backup-times (although I did not run it down to ZERO.I am running 2-21"" LCD monitors an AMD processor with the computer packed full of components and multiple drives. My loads are 10% for the computer and 2% for each monitor.I would buy it again."
3,A climb,"It is a wonderful story to tell, and I am sure it is loosely written on fact vs. fiction. But I found it dragged on and on and just lost interest until I finally I had to put it down, unfinished. I don't do that very often."
3,A disappointment,"I wanted to like this book, but I expected a lot, and found it a disappointment. The first half about Grania's struggles with learning how to communicate and trying to fit in with her family and friends was interesting and new perspective, even though a bit slow at times and not always that compelling. As far as the second half, I have read other books that have dealt with the horrors of WWI, and this one offered not one new perspective or new point of view or descriptions. I didn't see how it added to the story at all, and at this point in the book I really wished I wasn't reading it, but I guess some part of me wanted to find out what happened, and I felt that the ending was a let down. Mostly, I feel that this topic could have been really, really engrossing, new, and compelling, but the book's lackluster plot and storytelling left me flat. I won't recommend this book."
4,Extreme survival,A truly inspiring story of survival against all odds - the elements and a determined human foe. An incredible story of irregular warfare in the extreme. An adventure that is beyond comprehension and seems too incredible for belief. It is difficult to read the story and not feel the chill and the terror in your own bones. A phenomenal story of heroism and survival against all odds.
2,Inner Realm not what I expected,I have been purchasing Inner Realm for my wife for years. This was a large bottle for a good price. I usually buy the smaller bottle. It does not have the scent as previous bottles. Not sure what the difference is. I will buy elsewhere next time.
1,"NOT THE SAME AS THE ""OLD"" INNER REALM!","This is NOT the same Inner Realm I have worn for 15 years or more! I wish someone would explain to me what happened to the old version, and WHERE did this one come from?! I'm going to try ordering something that shows to be packed in the old blue box..."
5,FANTASTIC!!!,BUDDY GUY IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH BB KING. HE TEARS IT UP! BLUES LIKE IT'S MEANT TO BE. THE TRACT IS GOOD. THE WHOLE CD IS GOOD. IF YOU LOVE BLUES THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE.
5,MEKONG,"While above reviewers apparently were concerned enough to try and verify this person was a SEAL, they must have forgotten the disclaimer that name, places , etc. were changed and embellished. The take i got was it seemed like a combination ofmany different seals stories. Much like what Oliver Stone did with his movie Platoon, and Richard Marcinko did with his books. Actually i felt it had a Richard Marcinko feel to it. Realistic and very action packed."
1,False all the way,"Contrary to some reviewers, the author did claim he was a SEAL in Vietnam. Co-author Reeves said all the names were changed(except for SEAL narrator Taylor of course) and some incidents were mixed together, but these type of things did happen in his SEAL team he insists(shooting kids, smoking dope on patrol, openly being racist,etc.). Reeves further claims that Taylor's nightmares were reduced by telling his story. As we know now, James C. Taylor was never a SEAL or in Vietnam, let alone a SEAL in Vietnam. He was a Navy mechanic stationed here in the U.S.Military records confirmed this in Stolen Valor .Furthermore, the comparisons to Marcinko's books is also wrong. Those are books of heroism, teamwork,reality, and humor. In other words this book is a sham."
4,Great book for beginners!,"This is a great book even though it is an older book. It is worth buying just for the disbudding box plan and the folding milk stand plan. There are many good pictures (black and white) and diagrams. There is one, for example, that shows you what the horn area should look like after disbudding, how to milk: right and wrong way, and where to place the weight tape, etc. Lots of great beginner stuff.The medicine sections are a little outdated, especially on wormer medications, otherwise I would've given it 5 stars."
5,wish it was summer...,"people having problems listening this record and givin' it 1 star, makes me wanna say - ""your business is not dance music, choose another path"" if u have a love/hate relation with dance music, stay away from this, cause this is for true dance music lovers, and, makes me wanna shout - it is awesome. the tracks by dandrea doria and miss kittin r 2 examples of what i am saying. if ure into dance music, get it while u can, u have been 2 long far away from real pleasure.David is da man!"
3,Fun but work,"""Santa"" brought this train to my son, who was very happy with the great gift. It seems fairly well made for the price, the engine and cars are sturdy, the track is easy to assemble and the station is a cute decoration and everything worked well right out of the box. After a short while of running though the engine was obviously losing traction so I cleaned the wheels and the tracks, both of which were quite black with oil/dirt(?) and it ran well for a while but, again, started losing traction. So I cleaned it again, more oil/dirt. Now, the house isn't that bad, so it must be the train itself. We have other toy trains so I expect some maintenance but this seems quite a bit more than usual. Santa should have left an elf to keep the thing running properly!"
1,Do Not Buy This!,This Train is a peice of junk. It didn't even work when my husband put it together he had to modify it to even work. The little building is junk when you try to take it out of the packaging it broke all up and he was being gentle. Now that he finally got it working it is so loud we can't even have it on. Please don't waste your money!
1,Train set,Train set construction less than expected for price. Had difficulties getting the trains to lineup on track. Wouldn't have bought if known the construction was not great.
5,Cool train set,Nice size to fit around Christmas tree. Colors of the trains are nice. Very fast. Easy to set up.worth the money.
4,HAVING TO REPAIR ALREADY,"At Christmas time I had looked everywhere for a train set for my grandsons, and was so happy to have found one that I knew they would love. The price was excellant, as it was on sale at 50% off. The train and cars are really cute, but very fragile for my 8 year old grandson to handle. The box states age 8 and up. The track of the train is good as it snaps together, however when I tried taking it apart again I found it most difficult. There are supposed to be two connectors that connect the transformer to the track, and only one of them could be attached, as the other was broken. So, needless to say, my grandsons were unable to use their train on Christmas morning. Rather then send the whole set back, I have taken it to a hobby shop and am having it repaired."
4,The Cabs go pop,"Well it still is Cabaret Voltaire because the lyrics are still paranoid but the music is getting lighter in form but that doesn't mean it's crap. Sensoria is probably the song that gets most people into Cabaret Voltaire with the juttery ""D-d-d-Do right."" But there are other songs on here to make you feel like dancing. Digital Rasta is a beautiful song where Mallinder sings "" Selling something like you sell yourself, money in the bank but your under pressure"" making it the perfect mate for you when you're a little peed off about your managerOf course it might take a bit of time if you bought The Crackdown and were expecting something similar ( it's not quite the same ) and/or if you think the amount of tracks you get is not enough to make you shell out your money but stick with it - it's a good album"
5,Paranoid Pop Perfection,"This is easily the Cabs best album. Their decision to move away from the free-form industrial electronic experimentation of 'Voice of America' et al is perfectly justified with this recording. While the poppier edge may disarm you at first, this record is brimming with aspects to enjoy, every song conceals a deeper, darker underside. 'Spies in the Wires' is by far the best track (closely followed by Do Right), the way the beat kicks in and infectious chorus (not to mention evocative lyrics)....wow....i'm usually the fan of harder edged stuff, liek neubauten, TG, SPK and the wild electronics of SP, Autechre etc but this is a real gem. Go buy. You won't regret it."
3,Middle English,"I was a bit shocked to discover that this edition of the book was in Middle English. Somehow, I missed that in the product description. I do not find it hard to read, but the Middle English is not annotated and I probably would not have purchased it if I had known that I would have to slog through opaque old spellings and the like.The book itself is an interesting read, not as amusing as I had hoped. I am concerned that the translation may not be accurate--my doubts arises because the text mentions separate courts of law and equity, and I would be surprised to learn that there was such a separation in Germany at the time that Ship of Fools was written. However, it is my understanding that this translation was a successful publication in English, regardless of how true it is (or is not) to the original. So, I am happy to have read it."
2,"Boring, slow-paced story did not hold my attention","I usually plow right through novels I enjoy and find interesting, but this book was dull to me. The story seems to crawl and is depressing, and the character of Annie is enraging at times. You find yourself wondering why Myrtle keeps putting up with Annie and her bratty, flirty, accusatory ways. The death of Archie is very sad and the turning point for the story, yet the plot remains snail-paced and sleepy. I don't recommend this book if you are looking for a pleasant, fast-paced, interestingread."
3,Mas o menos...,"Es un poco complicado que se mantenga en determinadas posiciones, y no soporta muy bien el peso de la cámara."
5,It's Good!,"My life as a photographer was hum drum before the addition of Flexpod Flexible Tripod, now I'm invited to parties all the time and my life is filled with rainbows and happy puppies."
1,Doesnt hold my T2i,"I bought this is hopes that it would actually work, but guess what? It doesn't. At least it was cheap. Don't bother."
2,Misleading photo; low load capacity,"The product photos are very, very misleading. Anything bigger than a point-and-shoot, even my lightweight Sony NEX or a speedlight, will cause the top ball joint to tilt and the unit to topple over.The plastic links in the legs don't fit tightly enough to make this as versatile as, say, a real Gorillapod."
5,perfect,"Oh My God, it just perfect and the price exelent. I can wait to star to use it in the outside. Thank you, magdalena"
5,nice,"great tripod, its very funtional and practic outdoors. recomented to amateur photographers. you can use diferent adapters to use different cameras"
5,Great for price!,"This is a simple and small (stands about 6 1/2 in) digital camera tripod. It is exactly what is described in the product description. It should only be used for lighter weight cameras, but it really works great. The legs of the tripod twist and bend in every direction to help get a firm foundation for your camera to take a steady picture. All you do is screw your camera onto the base, and press the quick release button to easily slide your camera off the tripod without having to unscrew it. My camera still fits nice into the case with the base still screwed on.This is a great product and is very reasonably priced! I would definitely recommend, but only for lighter compact digital cameras."
2,Breaks easily,"The head joint wasn't sturdy, and couldn't support my light. My cat walked by and tipped it over, breaking off two of the legs. Talk about fragile! At least I didn't waste too much money on this thing!"
2,Flimsy at best,Won't even hold up my camera without a lens. Not worth the trouble to return though. Maybe I can use it to hold up a business card or something. Anything heavier causes it to fall.
1,Worthless. Don't buy,The connections between the individual pieces are way too loose. This will not hold up a camera of any size or weight.
2,Weak Legs,"The joints on the legs are not tight enough to support the weight of an average camera and it won't stand up for more than a few seconds. However, the legs seem to work fine when grasping things and supporting the camera."
5,Excellent alternative to Gorillapods,"I bought this because I didn't want to spent 5x as much on a Gorillapod, and am not disappointed. The joints are strong, and it stands tall. I bought another off-brand one as well ([...]), and it actually feels slightly stronger, but I will be using both. I use them for my Sony point and shoot camera, as well as my 3M mini projector.It includes two heads so that you can easily switch out what you have on it, without having to unscrew them.Definitely worth the money, and worth the savings!"
4,"Flip Friendly,Gorilla Type, Mini Tripod.",Who can go wrong with this tripod! OMG Look at the price!It looks like a Gorilla pod and it fits great on my Flip Video.I use it for the car as a dash cam and out and about in the out doors.I used it a lot on the snow to record video.So far so good.
4,Quite a hit,"For such a simple item - this was quite a hit with my daughter who likes to create her own utube's at home. It's handy, easy to use and gives a lot of flexibility with positions and shots."
1,Ya get what you pay for,"Total piece of junk. There's not enough tension in the tripod for it to hold anywhere for any length of time. I actually wound up taping it to the handle of my golfkart but then the screwmount separated from the hinge ball it connected to.There may be a good flexible tripod out there, but this sure isn't it."
1,poor quality,After a few months the legs became loose and it was hard to get the camera in place. Eventually one of the legs broke off. Dont waste your money.
1,not for large camera,"This product works ok for small cameras. I put my camera on the Flexpod Tripod,smaller than the one shown, and it would not stand up. The legs are very flexible and would not hold up the camera."
3,Misleading product image,"I purchased this product believing it was similar to the bigger, DSLR-sized gorillapod - it's not. It's the same size as the flexible tripod I bought for my point and shoot years ago. Combined with the fact that the legs pop off with almost no force, I'll be regfting this product this Christmas and trusting my DSLR to a better product."
4,Appropriate Tripod for Small Camera,"This tripod is great for a small camera. Although the photo shows a rather large one, it is not strong enough to support one that size. It was handy on our vacation and we used it frequently."
4,Great for the Money,"Although this would not work for a larger camera, this was an amazing purchase for the $4 I spent on it. It works great for my small digital camera because I can wrap the tripod's legs around many different objects and set the timer. Some reviews said theirs broke immediately, but I have traveled with mine and used it several times already without even one connection breaking. Good for beginners."
1,it has no value,"It has no value. It can't carry my cannon sx50, You can use it as decoration, there aren't other uses."
3,A little weak,"This is good for what it is but it won't hold much. I got it to hold an off camera flash but the swivel is too weak to hold it at any angle. I knew that it was going to be a little lacking because of the price, but I'll have to find another use. If there was a way to tighten the swivel head it would be better. Otherwise it won't hold more than a couple ounces."
2,Flexpod Flexible Tripod - Not Very Useful if You Have a slightly Heavier Camera,"Got this tripod for a travel workation that I had coming up. First, although I paid for a 2-day delivery, it arrived after 8 days so I couldn't take it on my trip. (The vendor, on complaining however, refunded the difference between the regular shipping and the standard shipping rates.)The tripod itself is very lightweight and so suitable for pocket digital cameras weighing maybe less than 200gm or about half a pound. Since the product description did not mention this limit I ordered it for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28, a slightly heavier camera. The tripod had difficulty maintaining position - specially if the legs were wound around a pole or a banister. The head would just droop in a couple of seconds rendering it completely worthless for my use. I just wish the vendor would have clarified this in their product description so that I hadn't wasted my time and money purchasing this product."
3,Not the Best,"I found my flexible tripod to fail in holding up my video and small cameras. The legs work great, but the part above the legs just falls over. I can see that my video camera might be a little heavier, but my camera is very small and I had high expectations that fall short."
2,For point & shoot cameras,"The image don't represent the real product.It's very tiny and it can't hold my speedlite, btw if you need it for a small point & shoot camera it's ok."
1,CHEAP plastic!!! Can't hold a regular DSLR,"This tripod is really cheap, it doesn't hold a regular DSLR camera( mine is Canon Ti3). The picture is misleading."
1,Didn' work for me,"Got this yesterday and couldn't use it. I bought this because it was a cheap way for me to take long exposures with my little Panasonic point and shoot camera. This tripod is useless. Once the camera is mounted on the tripod, it tends to droop to one side or other. The pivot ball at the top of the tripod isn't stiff enough to hold the camera in place. If it were tighter, I think it would work fine. Waste of money."
4,Pretty useful and portable,"Bought this right before a trip, used it for taking videos. It made the camera pretty stable but i think the product picture is misleading. I dont think this product can hold a large camera like the one shown in the pictures. I had to move around the stand to get the center of gravity right for my camera to stay up, otherwise it would tip over.All in all, still a good buy for the price and definitely useful for trips where a large tripod is not worth the hassle."
3,Much smaller than the picture,The product seems to function fine but it is MUCH smaller than indicated in the picture. The picture seems to imply that is would even hold a dSLR but it wouldn't hold anything more than a compact pocket camera.
4,Perfectly Small,So I ordered this expecting it to be a substantial size but it came in a box in a box that was really tiny. Did not expect that. i have been messing with it and wrapping the legs around everything possible. It is a really neat tripod that i would buy again. So far i havent had any mishaps even after me dropping it on the floor (camera included) :O woops.
2,Easy to use....easier to break!,"This product did not hold up to my needs. The clip broke the second time I used it! Not good for holding on sideways, only on a level surface."
4,Flexpod Flexible Tripod,does exactly what it says it will. has a quick change for a couple of cameras. :) I wanted it to do something different. that is a personal problem.
3,Works well for SMALL cameras,"Works well for small cameras, but my Nikon S9100 is just at that point that it makes the top slowly tilt.I think it would really work great for small cameras, and even my S9100 would be fine if it had the connection screw in the center. However, the S9100 has the screw far on the left side, so the camera starts out still, but then starts to slowly tilt to one side from the weight. I think I will be able to figure out ways to keep it up-right, but the camera is just a little too heavy on the right.If you have a medium-large or large camera, or a small-medium camera that has the attachment screw not centered, then I would recomend getting the larger version of this tripod instead of this one."
3,wont hold anything heavy at all,"i got this tripod to put my 580 exii flash on it, with only the flash on it, it is not stiff enough to keep from collapsing under its weight....this would only be good if you had a very lightweight point and shoot on it"
4,Camera flexible tripod,"I love this. It is so compaact that is fits nicely in my purse and will be a regular addition to my hiking backpack. Easy to get into shape. Pictures of these show them wrapped around poles but when I tried, the whole thing slid down. I can't imagine when I would ever need to wrap around a pole, though. Works nocely on uneven surfaces. Hope that helps. For the price (less than $5.00 with s&h) there's no way I could go wrong."
1,Doesn't actually fit small cameras,"I bought this for a Sony Bloggie, seeing how it's a compact video camera. The screw is too short to hold the camera. It was a complete waste of money."
1,wasted money,I thought it was gonna be like the gorillapod.....I got a dissappointment......not as stiff as it should be has come apart where the joints are connected......sorry I bought it
3,It's Good,"not great. It is much smaller than the picture looked on the website. I am sure there were dimensions but without a ruler in front of me, it kind of means nothing. Anyway- quality is good, just small."
3,JUST OK,I thought it was stronger but it can't hold my camera properly... it's a nice product for small light weight cameras
2,Too small,I thought is was going to be larger because of the picture of the large camera on it. I am very disappointed.
4,Baking issues,"The pan has good detail and really shows up on the baked cake. I used the ""cake release"" stuff and it popped out with no problem! The only difficulty I found was that it did not cook evenly because of the weird shape. Obviously, the top part cooked faster. I tried using some tin foil which helped (but if you try this, remember to leave room for the cake to rise). Came with some detailed directions too."
4,Not heavy-duty but makes a cute cake,"I have this Wilton pan as well as the dump truck one and, while I'm not a professional baker, both seem somewhat cheap. They're definitely not heavy duty bakeware. As I said I'm not a pro, but I assume it's thin and flexible to it's easier to flip the cake out after it's done baking? Even though I sprayed the pan with non-stick spray, part of the cake still had a little issue sticking to the pan. It also scratches REALLY easily so be careful! I did like that the sheet inside had several decorating suggestions with instructions. The instructions aren't super detailed (basically tells you which decorating tips to use), but it's not hard to figure out. My son's b-day cake turned out great, so I'm happy with this purchase."
3,Nice detail - not very large.,I ordered this cake pan for my daughter's birthday. It's cute and has nice detail - but - it's not as large as it seems. It only holds 1 regular box of cake mix. (Maybe that's obvious to experienced bakers but I thought it would bake a much larger cake.) We'll be supplementing with cupcakes.
2,Factually Interesting...but Inappropriate,"While I found much of the information interesting, I thought the author and especially the illustrator crossed the line.I do not find this book or its illustrations appropriate for elementary age children.* Nudity* Illustrations of men and women bathing together* One illustration actually shows a woman's nippleVERY INAPPROPRIATE and I am disappointed that my children's elementary school has this in its library."
1,"Serious Moonlight, Poor Quality DVD","I had watched this David Bowie concert years ago when it premiered on HBO. The quality of the music and the video were superb. I was so excited to find the DVD of this same concert that I purchased it and anticipated reliving this wonderful show. Nothing could be further from the truth on this transfer to DVD. I'm surprised that David Bowie or HBO would allow such a poor quality DVD be released. It's a shame, because the concert performance is excellent, but the sound on this DVD is muddy and the video is blurred. I had purchased a used copy from the one of the Amazon sellers. The DVD actually froze up on me prior to the end of the DVD. I was so upset by then that I just threw it away. To their credit, the sellers have refunded my money anyway, although I do not now have the DVD to return. 5 stars to the used DVD seller, and one star to Amazon for selling such a cheap ripoff as this DVD."
3,Poor Video,"Even considering the age of this recording, I can only say that the video quality is very poor. I cannot praise the sound quality either (though I have heard worse). Still, a Bowie fan will want to have this DVD."
2,Poor audio and video quality,"I am about as big a David Bowie fan as anybody can realistically claim to be, but even I cannot muster much enjoyment from watching this DVD.True, several of the interpretations of songs on this disc are classic and highly worth hearing. However, there is no escaping the fact that the disc started with dated media and was remastered sloppily, if at all. The video is in ""soft focus"" throughout (to put it charitably) and the technical sound quality low."
3,Poor Production Dogs The Thin White Duke,"While I enjoyed Bowie's tight band and Bowie himself having a ball, the video quality was grainy and the editing doesn't give you a sense of being there. The editing makes it seems as if the Bowie was just running through his numbers. I would have liked to seen Bowie interacting more with the crowd which I imagine was edited out of the concert to some degree."
3,Be Careful,"If You are really into 80's Bowie (as I am) and are a big fan, maybe you will appreciate this souvenir. But don't expect to watch it much. As others have already noted, the transfer from VHS (or Film) to this DVD is bad. I thought maybe it wasnt as bad as others said and it was cheap so I tried it anyway. Disappointed. The colors are dull and blurry and the sound is not good. Even in surround. Its a reminder of the show way back when, but not much more. I couldn't do the whole thing in 1 sitting.If you are a collector, buy it cheap as I did and just keep it. Good for a few minutes here and there for nostalgia. If you want quality Bowie 80's style you wont be happy with this. trust me on that."
5,GREAT SETLIST!,"I am very glad this concert is available as it is a great document to David Bowie at possibly the peek of his popularity. A huge star at this point and playing the artist in giant size stadiums that were hardly the proper venue for much of his adventurous music. Still Bowie and band pull off a great show and fans of his early to mid career will be happy as he plays songs off of every record released except I don't think he performed anything from his debut or Ziggy Stardust. At least one song off every other recording makes this a pleasing and well performed concert. Heroes, Cracked Actor, Golden years, Life On Mars, Young Americans, Rebel Rebel, Space Oddity... and on and on. Nice setlist! The band plays great, but their dynamism is sometimes diminished by a so so recording mix, but it's not as awful as some other reviewers are saying. Good stuff."
2,Poor video and sound quality spoil this,"The Serious Moonlight Tour was a brilliant concert tour. I was at the Singapore performance and enjoyed it tremendously. However, the picture and sound quality on this disc fails to do credit to DVD technology."
4,BOWIE'S BEST SET LIST,"As they say, watching this bring back a lot of memories.This is worth getting to see the man at his commercial peak in 1983. Musically, he hadn't performed a full scale tour since 1979. Serious Moonlight was very ambitious stuff.The fact is: this was one of Bowie's best concert line-ups ever - encapsulating an amazing 15 years of music. Never short of great backing bands - the band here is the biggest and funkiest perhaps that Bowie has ever had with 2 backing singers and a horn section.The rehearsals of the Serious Moonlight Tour had a staggering 29 songs in the setlist - amazing when you consider Bowie had to carry each song.My only complaint with this set is that it doesn't include the encores and has only 18 songs! And the only thing that dates the look of the show is David's poodle blond hair. A small quibble...PS My favourite tracks are ""White Light White Heat"" and ""Cracked Actor"" - guitarist Earl Slick really shines."
3,Good product,Product was good; the cover did what is was supposed to do and is quite pretty. Overall a good buying experience.
2,Spray N Wash (pump spray) w/Resolve,"I have used Spray N Wash in the aerosol can since, I believe, the sixties. I could depend on it to remove any and most all stains. In recent years I could get it at Wal-Mart only. Now it is gone and has been replaced (?) by a pump spray w/ resolve. The liquid spray is not nearly as good...is this a part of going green? I know this won't do any good, but I feel better venting my opinion. There is nothing like Spray N Wash in the aerosol can.Not a Happy Camper...Joanne"
2,use your library priviledges,same ol same ol. someone just needed to print a book. Nothing new in this one. Borrow it before buying it.
4,From the Civil War era to a Myrtle Beach honeymoon ...........,"This is a unique book by Robert Morgan. It is a collection of short stories that run the gamut from the Civil War era to a young married couple going to Myrtle Beach for their honeymoon. It is an odd collection that is intriguing, strange, unexpected and at times touching. The stories seem to center on the family as a building block and it's importance in the lives of those from one generation to the next, with it's strength ebbing and flowing and creating unexpected ripples in the future that each individual pursues."
1,Why this book was so bad.,"I am a huge fan of Rosemary Rogers but I have to admit when I read this book I was in shock. I couldn't believe that Rosemary Rogers wrote it. Well, guess what? She didn't. Rosemary Rogers had a mental break down in the middle of the first draft of this book and a member of her family finished it. I hope this explains a lot to her fans."
1,It belongs in the trash!,"If the the copy I had didn't belong to the library I would have thrown this book in the trash were it belongs! I can't believe this book was ever published it's not just horrible but atrocious! I'm glad this book is out of print. Please, please, please don't waste you time and money on this monstrosity!"
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"WHAT A HOT MESS!!! I could barely get through this trash & when I finished that is where the book ended -- in the trash. Wasn't worthy of a second hand book store. No one else should be subjected to this & if I could give it no stars, that would still be too high of a rating."
1,Horribe Horrible Horrible,"This book was so horrible it wasn't even funny. There was no redeeming qualities for either of the two main characters! How can you even label it a romance. It was a tragedy. Not only did the writing/plot not make a lot of sense, constantly jumping around and such but the characters lacked even a smidgen of morals!!! The H slept with the h's best friend who was a .... well I think you know and he didn't seem to give a care about all the abuse that the h went through at the hands of her so called ""step brother""! Nope he just added to it. I think this book is more a study in obsession. Sick Obesession!!!!! It really would have been better if Trista had just disappeared never to be seen again. I think Blaze would have been just fine with that. I know I would have been fine with those two not getting together. . . EVER!!!!!! Can't see how anyone could ever say those two loved each other."
3,Very good new account,with perhaps not enough action pictures but certainly shedding much light on just what happened over there.
5,Cuba in its quest for universal freedom,great film with historical footage that elucidates Cuba's assistance to Africa in the struggle against colonialism. gained information on how Africa's reistance against the colonial powers would never have been obtained were it not for the Cuban people.
5,Excellent little guitar,"I love my Daisy Rock Stardust Elite. After reading an outstanding review in Guitar Player magazine I was swayed from the equally girly-glam Rock Candy to this little beauty and I wasn't disappointed. The tones are rich and full, without the annoyance of neck buzzing like its Rock Candy counterpart.For my smallish hands the 3/4 scale neck is perfect. I can easily switch between barre chords without manually placing each finger (read: using my right hand to place my fingers on the chords) to obtain additional reach. My speed and flow of notes improved from the first go on my Elite. Additionally, the slim line of the body makes for comfortable playing.Even my boyfriend, who is a seasoned guitarist, is surprised and satisfied with the quality and sound from this ""girly"" guitar. Don't let the name, concept, or sparkly colors fool you - these guitars are quality instruments with a great sound."
4,Russian Jewish Artists,"Excellent coverage of the titled time span (1890-1990.) I would have liked more color photographs however, that must likely would have increased the price of the book.Ms. P. Right"
2,More helpful books are available on Bagua Zhang (Pa Kua),"In 1983 this would have been considered good, but now there are several other better books available.The value of this book would be for historical value, and not so much for learning Bagua Zhang."
2,I've read better,There are other books out there that take you through the entire pregnancy and parenting. Other books are much more comprehensive than this one. I really didn't find it helpful at all.
3,Great music but no soul here,"I have seen the stage production of Smoke on the Mountain done by a professional theatre group in Crossville, Tennessee, not far from the mountains of North Carolina where this play takes place. The play and the music were so outstanding that I looked for the CD on Amazon, but was somewhat disappointed when I got it and listened to it. The cover says ""Music from the New York hit musical,"" and therein lies the problem. These people just don't do justice to this great down-home southern music, even though the liner notes claim that some of the artists are indeed southerners. Their performance is just too perfunctory. There's no soul in it. I still enjoy the CD, but my recommendation is to go see the play and hear the music in a southern venue done by genuine southerners who really FEEL the music. Bottom line: You might enjoy the CD, but this New York version doesn't compare with the real thing."
3,Grows on you,"I like the CD, from what I;ve heard (I'm listening to it now). If you heard There You Go on the radio and kinda liked it, it grows on you more after you get the CD. I like that one and #5 the best, #6 and #8 are also good. :)"
4,she's got her own style,sounds kind of like destiny's child and the like. But she's got a nice beat and she sings really well. She's got talent. Hell wit ya has a nice beat. This is on the border between pop and rnb.
4,Shes got class,"Cant take me home is an excellant debut album. Pink has her own unique sound and is fastly becoming one of the most respected female singers about at the moment. Featuring the singles, There You Go, Most GIrls and the forcoming single You Make Me Sick, Pink shows that she has a varied musical taste and lyrical range. It would be wise to take this cd home today"
5,shes a girl you dont want to mess with !!,she is one of those girls you dont want to mess with but she is very talented at the same time. she has a beautiful voice with a high quality singing technique. i love her CD because it's wondreful to listen to and enspiring to all woman of the world this is not a CD for the faint hearted!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,You have to buy this cd!,"I just don't like this cd...I love it! The whole cd has songs for everyone. Pink did a great job mixing the genres of hip-hop, altrenative, pop, r&b, and jazz into her cd. I bought this cd yesterday after only knowing of one great song (There u Go) and fell completely in love with the rest of it. Buy this cd you won't be disappointed."
5,Love hurts,"I got very excited when Pink's song came out and everywhere you went you heard it. I thought here is this great new teenage girl who has a good voice and is gonna bring out a good CD. LOL so I'm a little late I guess you can say on getting this, blame it on I usually have enough money to only buy a new CD about 3 or 4 times a year. I know it sucks. But anyway back to her. Pink shows many different personalities like in her song ""Split personality"" which is my #1 favorite. Also song #1. ""Is it Love or Just a Curse"" is my second favorite. Wait till you hear the song ""Can't take me Home"" it is not for the kids but as a teenager going thru hard times you will relate. And ""Hell with ya"" is such a good dance song. And let's not forget that Pink is honest and isn't afraid to pound on those good for nothing men. Goooo on, girl!!!!!!"
1,One of the Worst Albums I Owned,This was a terrible waste of money. The only good songs to me are: Most Girls and You Make Me Sick. The rest sound alike and are pure filler. This was a terrible debut. Don't waste your money on this one. Wait for the greatest hits compilation whenever it hits the stores.
1,Do Not Buy This CD!,this is not a good cd. dont buy it it is really bad. instead you should biy Pink' new album Missundatzood.Do Not buy Cant Take Me Home
4,There you go,"This Artist is hot, she's gonna blow up the music scene not only does she have a beautiful face and body, her music bounces."
5,LOVE PINK,I LOVE PINK AND THIS IS THE ONLY CD I DIDNT HAVE I LOVED HER CAREFREE TELL IT HOW IT IS SONGS AND ITS GREAT TO EXERCISE TO --GETS THAT HEART PUMPING
4,Product?,"I don't know, some of the songs on this album sound too much a like. This was when Pink was very unoriginal and just seemed like an easy marketed product. Her music was like that too. But if you're looking for good carbon-copy R&B/soul/pop/hip-hop, hit this album up! You won't be disappointed!"
3,Would have been nice to know it was the 'edited' version,"I would have liked to know it was the 'clean' version - I wanted the explicit, other than that it's all good."
4,Energy Packed,This CD keeps me focused on my tasks at work. I keep it on to keep an upbeat feeling in the air.
3,"Pink is a hot RNB hit, but it stops there",Pink's album 'Can't Take Me Home' will appeal to those Rnb listners of such crooners as Aaliyah and Monica. But the point is her album has no pop appeal at all it is strait Rnb. This works for her dstintive voice. Although ballads dont really say Pink on them she could use a little more vocal range on them instead of sticking to her 2 to 3 octive range. Cmon pink! I know you can do better! Fave Track: Most Girls (oozes overproduction) Least Fave Track: I'm Falling (she did with this song)
4,The debut of a new voice,"""Can't Take Me Home"" is a breath of freshness for the stagnent hip-hop/mainstream music. Her voice can rival Whitney Houstons and make Mary J. Take notice. This Cd is my favorite, however it was overlooked by the mainstream, but had some success when tacked to the movie ""Save The Last Dance"". However some of the tracks were alittle hard to get into...and other where the tryed and true boring formula that works; but with no twist. it is worth the money to go and get this LP"
3,Not Her Best,"Pink is one of my favorite artists. I have bought her other cds (M!ssundaztood, and Try This)and those were awesome. I listened to This cd and I liked 3 tracks. Her other albums were better. I recommend those ones if you're looking for Pink's best."
4,Spilt Personality-Definitely!!!,"Besides the pink hair and killer bod, there's a real singer in there with a true personality. Her vocals are outstanding and her balads (Let Me Let You Know, Stop Falling, and Is It Love...) have a real meaning about love relationships gone bad, what she wants in her ideal guy, and veiws on herself and her surroundings. Her best up-tempo songs (Hiccup, Most Girls, and definitely Do What You Do, and Spit Personality...) aren't drowned in beat and meaningless lyrics; they disscuss her philosophies on love, life, desiscions, and herself. Like I said before, besides the spiked, pink hair and killer bod, ther's a real artist in there who's destined to be a star. This album is a definite must buy!!!"
3,Pink sees red,"When Pink came out with her first single ""there you go"", I expected a soild debut album. Well, I was wrong. CAN'T TAKE ME HOME is just average. Pink has a good singing voice and she has the attitude but the production is lame. A lot of songs on CAN'T TAKE ME HOME sound like Timbaland/Destiny's Child rip offs. The song ""most girls"" is actually the best song on here. Others that come close are ""private show"" and ""can't take me home."" Pink gets all of anger out on here but at times it seems like she's holding back. The ballads are a mess. They're long and drawn out. Pink's at her best on the uptemos. CAN'T TAKE ME HOME is an average debut."
3,Not Pinks best but satisfying,"I own this cd and I'm listening to the full thing so I figured I'd write a review. I have this cd for the songs I listened to as a child on the radio; There You Go, You Make Me Sick and Most Girls. Split Personality and Stop Falling are both good songs as well but other then that, the album is basicly repetative upbeat stuff that basicly sounds the same.It's safe to say she's grown so much as a musician from this album but except for her radio hits this cd isn't worth buying."
3,Pretty good,"I like Pink because after I heard There You Go I thought she was the best singer out. Then I got the entire CD. Well I still think Pink is a good singer and has a good voice but I do't like her as much. If you liked There You Go then you'll love this CD. I really really liked her third song, Most Girls and the last one Is It Love?. There You go is the best song but some songs sond too much alike each other. By the way I can't tell if she's black or white will somebody tell me!?"
2,Surprisingly Disappointed,"I bought her album Misundaztood and was so upbeat about getting this album to go with it. What a disappointment! This album is very different with a very monotonous rap background music on almost every song. This album is not near as good, nor shows the talent of this entertainer that she demonstrated on other CD. If you like Rap music that is about the same in every song with just a change of words but with the same background, you might want to spend money on this album. Otherwise, buy Misundaztood, skip this one, and hope for better things on her next release."
1,Very Predictable,This Disc is Very Boring.Pink has Leftover Toni Braxton Songs.She Sounds Like a 5th Member of Destinys Child.and that's not saying much.How Many Folks are Gonna Ride Timberland's Beats? Enough Already.Very Predictable&Formula Sounding.
5,"Life, living, love, hate, cheating men and revenge","I like listening to this, Can't take me home. Pinks bold attitude is a nice change ONLY because I am so sick of wimpy r/b singers who only talk about love and how sweet it is. YEAAAH right. Pink lets it be known she don't expect much love just heartbreak here or there. Well she keeps it real and her lyrics show hardness and softness at once. The beats are fast typical TLCish kind of stuff but I like it a lot and my favorite song on here is #8 Private show. Babyface, who has done songs for Whitney Huston, Mariah and TLC does 3 songs on here, Split personalty (#1), Most girls (#3) and hiccup (#12). Something I like about the disc is she keeps it real with harmony filled slow jams but next minute goes to blistering hot fast shots of adrenilin. Like There you go or Hell Wit ya. Perfect CD of the year."
3,Better than I thought,"I originally bought this CD for the one song that gets radio play 'There You Go' but after I heard a few of the other tunes I was impressed. I love her attitude and style. She's got a sort of raunchiness about her- which I find HOT! It may be pop and I am not usually a fan of pop but, this is the perfect album to get rid of boy-blues. There is a song to fit every scenario. Need some confidence- track 2 and 4 are perfect. Can't find the words- Hiccup is just what you need. Not all tracks are worth much- but the handfull you get are worth the 15 bucks."
4,Everybody has to have a little P!NK in them!,"This debut album from this newcomer is very well put together. Her style is not only unique, but could be very trendsetting. Her music is somewhat a cross between Rap/R&B/Pop/and a little Rock thrown in, but all in a good way. She collaborates with many great producers/writers such as Babyface, SoulShock & Karlin, She'kspeare, 112, ""Tricky"" Stewart and many more. Some of the more outstanding tracks on the album would have to be the essentric, mind-boggling SPLIT PERSONALITY, the stereo-rocking YOU MAKE ME SICK, and the sure-fire hit MOST GIRLS. Other notable songs are the infectious HICCUP and beat-driven PRIVATE SHOW. A few traditional ballads (i.e. STOP FALLING and LET ME LET YOU KNOW) thrown in with this blend of edgy, body-moving tracks makes this album a great start for a bright future for P!NK."
4,Pink got it going on!!,Well first I got to say if I was not looking at the cover I would think she was a black person.. She got heart and she sings with true feelings... I think her music career will go very far.She has so much power in her voice
2,So-So,"Afterhearing There you Go and Most Girls, I had high hopes for this album but in many ways was disappointed. Split Personality ends before it really ever gets going, Hell Wit Ya is pretty boring and i usually skip past it, As i said Most Girls and There You Go are great songs, she obviously chooses the right song to release as a single. Private Show is personally my favourite song, but with other songs such as Love is such a crazy thing and Hiccup, it makes me wonder why i bought this album..."
4,CAN'T TAKE ME HOME IS A TIGHT ALBUM! OFF THE HOOK!,"Can't Take Me Home is definitely off the hook. It's a great album and Pink is a great singer. When the album comes out, EVERYONE who is into good music atleast, should think about picking it up from the store and buyin' it!"
2,Leaves sticky film on floor,"Cleans floor ok but leaves a sticky film on the floor that everything sticks to, including tracks from walking on floor."
4,great hardwood floor cleaner,"This is the best product I've found for my hardwood floors. It gets up the dirt, bring out the vibrancy of the floors, and has a great smell, to boot. I only wish that it wasn't so expensive."
5,A Must To Own,"This is one of the iconic CD's to own. I originally purchased it as a cassette! Every song is amazing. It's a journey through melodic rock. There will only be one Triumph. This is there best CD. I'm not much on writing reviews, but I had to write something about this album."
3,It is very good!!!!,"This is a classi. ""Magic Power"" is one of the greatest rock songs of all times!!! The rhythms and harmonies are great!! The lyrics also! The only problem with Tirumph are the vocals. They have two singers: drummer GIl Moore and guitarrist Rik Emmett. When Moore sings, it's fine. But to hear Rik Emmett's horrible thin voice it's an agonizing experience!!!!"
4,An underrated release from an underrated band.,"This Canadian trio really knew how to make some noise and some great music. ""Allied Forces"" is arguably their best release and does not get as much air-play as it should. Three classic tunes ""Fight The Good Fight,""""Magic Power,"" and ""Ordinary Man,"" make this album a must have for any rock fan. Add the title track, ""Hot Time (In the City Tonight),"" and ""Fool For Your Love,"" and your listening to a hidden masterpiece. Living in the shadow of fellow Canadians Rush, may have hurt this band here in the states, but ""Allied Forces"" is definitely a great album."
2,Too expensive for the quality,"This is a good idea done wrong. Smaller, flimsier and almost twice as expensive as the Weber version. Mine rusted away quickly and although it was my first charcoal chimney I have moved on to the sturdier model.But it's a great idea and everyone who prefers charcoal (and who doesn't?) should use one.""If I wanted to cook with gas, I'd stay in the kitchen"""
5,Hilarious,"I had to order a copy of Arnez j ""IGot Problems in Chicago"" I saw this video when I was in Memphi, TN. One of my children had bought it over for me to see. It had my whole family (ALL ADULTS) rolling on the floor. This guy is something else. I would truely like to have more videos by Arnez j if they are available!"
5,"This book is the 1942 version, not the Martin Gardner version","Don't let the other reviews confuse you. Amazon automatically copied the reviews from the 1998 version to the kindle version. Poor form.The kindle book is the 1942 version of this classic, and I'm glad it's available. It's the book I used back in the 60's before high school to get a feel for the topic. College calculus was that much easier because of this book. Highly recommended, but absent Gardner's additional material and footnotes."
3,pre-gardner version was charming,"The pre-Gardner version of the book was utterly charming. The writing style is wonderful (""What one fool can do, another can.""). And even though I know calculus well, the pre-Gardner book still shed light on me -- ""Oh, right, I hadn't thought of it in that way!"" I am not sure whether reading this book is a good use of time nowadays for someone who is trying to learn calculus for the first time, given how well certain modern calculus textbooks are written; but at the time Thompson wrote this gem, standard calculus textbooks were generally atrocious, and this book must have been a godsend to many students. I have not read the post-Gardner version, but from reading the other reviews, it appears that Gardner removed much of the charm from the writing style. Why he would do that, I do not know. Four stars for the pre-Gardner book; 3 stars for post."
2,Very Misleading Title,"I have had 3rd edition of Thompson's book for many years, and this year I finally decided to study it. I was extremely disappointed. This book is very poorly written for laymen. (I found calculus guides published by Princeton and Barron's much easier to understand.) However, if you already know the basics of calculus and want to master the subject, this book is for you."
3,Really 2 1/2 stars...not bad but not great,"I really tried to like this book, and after going through 1/2 of it decided to sell it used. It is not great, has some relatively obsolete material which was not updated properly by the author. Better is the other Sylvanus collaboration from REA, Calculus Super Textbook (Super Textbooks). Better yet, if like me, you need a review after more than 20 years' (I took 3 calc sequences and DiffEq in 1978!), find an on-line calc course and take it (a good compromise between taking an attendance class and doing it yourself which usually never happens)."
4,A Timeless Classic,"I study calculus for my 'A' Level Further Math course. Reading the book prior, I can follow lectures and tutorials with less difficulty. My questions are easily answered by referring to this highly readable book.One explores calculus beside the author. No ""talking down""; the book imparts knowledge in a witty and irreverent manner.The version I use is 1974 reprint. In spite of its age, this version is still very useful, though the symbology is dated. I am certain the latest version is every bit as good as mine."
2,calculus book,"I received the book fast enough, the book itself however, not what i would call ""pleasure reading!"" It is part of one of my courses for my master's degree and up to now, I have read 5 chapters, i do not think it makes calculus easy!"
1,Calculus made Easy,"I am now finished with Calculus II and I still don't understand the content of thisbook. It is extremely complicated and poorly written. It makes it seem that Calculus is so easy, but it's just easier studying the old fasioned way, doing homework problems.I really don't recommend this book, at least for undergrads."
1,Avoid this Kindle edition!,"OK, this review is for the Kindle edition - the book itself is a classic and a must-read introduction to calculus. (five stars)However, this and any other edition based upon the Project Gutenberg one should be strictly avoided: none of the mathematical symbols, graphs, and formulas are preserved in any useful way. The one Kindle edition that can be recommended ishttp://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Made-Easy-ebook/dp/B003XYEAOW/ref=tmm_kin_title_2?ie=UTF8&m;=AG56TWVU5XWC2&qid;=1285861412&sr;=1-1That edition, the one priced at $3.00, is a scan of the original book so it is not a typical Kindle book (i.e., you can't changes font size, etc.). However, it preserves the original formulas and graphs.By the way, it should be noted that none of the Kindle editions are the version annotated by Martin Gardner."
1,UNREADABLE ON KINDLE,"As the other reviewer stated, this book is unreadable on the Kindle and I can't find a way to get my money back! Don't order the Kindle version."
5,Much help,In this book I really learned to understand much of calculus because in this book things are said in a clear manner without complications. I recommend it to anyone who is a calculus fan or needs to understand instead of memorizing
4,Very Good Introduction to Basic Calculus,"This book is great for those who simply can't understand the basic workings of calculus. The author gently introduces the concepts of derivation and integration, using terminology explicable to children. Although the author does a good job of presenting the ideas behind calculus, his efforts to connect this to the symbols and solutions of practical calculus problems are lacking."
4,A classic,"While this 'method' of explaining calculus has been superseeded by the 'limit theory' one, it is often more useful for those who are not going to major in maths (like engineers)."
2,Damaged board!,"I was very eager to receive this cutting board. The board itself is beautiful, however, as soon as opened the packaging, the board already had a crack in the grove. It came as a cracked board. Also there were black molds on the sides and the back of the board..If I ask for a exchange, do I have to pay for return shipping? I do like the color. I haven't even used it yet as I found this crack visible! Sigh I received a not so good one."
4,Great board,So far the cutting board has performed as expected. I have oiled it after each use and it has worked well.
3,Used book,It was as described. It looked like it had been torn through excessive use. It also was very old and the pages were highlighted throughout as described. The book was also what it was supposed to be. So overall I rate the seller as a person of their word but the book was pretty crappy. Then again I knew that when I bought it.
5,My husband just loves this little leather money clip & credit card holder!,"My husband has been using a metal money clip for years, since he hates the bulkiness of a wallet in his pocket. He was always dropping his money, credit cards or drivers license since they easily slip out of the old clip. He is very stubborn, and does not like change, so right after I ordered a replacement credit card (since his old credit card had cracked from the clip and became unreadable), I started looking for a product like this one and reading reviews. From the description and the reviews, this sounded like the perfect solution, so I ordered one right away. He absolutely loved it the moment I gave it to him and has been using it from that moment on. It holds everything securely (it holds a LOT of folded bills), credit cards, drivers license, etc, and has a very nice quality look and feel to it. This is an awesome product and I highly recommend it!"
1,Really Junky Item,I've been using this clip for less than two weeks and the clip part with the magnet is already coming apart at the seams.
1,The title should specify it's magnetic,see title. I found when I looked back that if I would have scrolled a page I wouldn't have made the mistake.
1,Did Not Tell Complete Story,"Unfortunately, the seller failed to specify that the money clip is magnetic. Magnetism and credit cards - a recipe for disaster!"
4,Great Value!!,This is a fantastic little money clip. The only thing about this I would change is the card holder slots should be a little wider.
1,You get what you pay for...,"Honestly, paying this much, do you really expect it to be good? If carrying your money around in a cheap piece of crap is for you, then buy this. If not, save your money. Give it to some hobo instead. This thing is so poorly made, the leather is so cheap and already torn in multiple places. The magnetic strip is misaligned and the stitching is already lifting. Seriously, is it just mine or are all of them this quality? Regardless, I'm not too upset, it was cheap. The first thing I did when I got this was throw it in my desk drawer, and went on Amazon to buy something else to hold my cash. Too crappy to use, not worth the trouble to return."
2,"Great idea, but poorly executed","I have had several wallets of this type, and generally think they are great because they are so thin and light. However, I can't recommend this one. I've had the wallet for less than five months, and it is already coming apart at the seams. The ""side"" pocket has the external leather tucked into it and glued down, and the glue has released, leaving loose ends to flap around and get caught on things. Already time to replace it, and obviously I won't be ordering another of this type."
2,Tight Money,The money clip would only hold one or two credit cards. It needs to be pre-stretched so you can carry identification with a few credit cards. Couldn't use it so threw it away. I f you want to carry money and a drivers licence it will be OK.
1,"Terrible, Awful, Brutal, Not for Gym Regulars.","I receieved the Valeo padded straps and headed off to the gym, after waiting a week for the product to arrive with shipping costs more than the cost of the straps which is rediculous. I purchased them after I lost my previous pair of TKO Fitness straps after beating on them for about 4 years with no problems. I put on the Valeo straps and did one pull-up, and one of the straps ripped in half right on the seam where the neoprene pad was sewn in. My advice, this product is poorly made and cheap. A complete waste of money. Go with something better, and I would avoid the padded straps because the extra stitching weakens the strap fabric."
2,One size doesn't fit all,"Maybe my wrists are small (~6 1/2"" around), but the positioning of the padding on these straps prevents them from properly tightening around my wrist, so I can't really use them properly or comfortably. Don't bother buying these unless your wrists are at least an inch larger around than mine."
2,Good only for a beginner,"These straps are cotton so they stretch during a heavy lift and transfer a lot of the weight back to your hands. It's difficult to get a good grip on heavy weight because of this. Also, the pad is too long so the strap can't be properly tightened around the bar because the loop hits on the pad. I would suggest non-cotton straps with a better pad design (e.g. the Harbinger nylon straps) for advanced lifting."
3,Missng Parts,"Units work great, but one of them came with the mounting bolts for the fan motor mount missing, so when we started it up, it knocked the fan out of balance. The company sent us a new fan overnight."
3,Missing,"BLINDING LIGHT SHOW! If it's going to be called classics, include THE Classic Non-single track from Triumph. Get King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents instead."
3,Hit & Miss,"Triumph is a Canadian power-rock trio who experienced some minor chart success in American in the late 70's and early 80's. This is a retrospective of their career and it is a truly hit or miss affair. When they hit, they make some excellent hard rock music and when they miss they come off as a bad imititation. ""Hold On"", ""Magic Power"", ""A World Of Fantasy"", ""Fight The Good Fight"" & ""Lay It On The Line"" are classics and you can pretty much skip the rest."
3,Only Occasionally Triumphs,"Triumph was either the Canadian answer to American rock bands like Styx and Kansas, or a poor man's Rush depending on your taste. The bottom line is that while they began life sounding a lot like Geddy Lee and company, they lacked the songwriting and performing skills to keep up the pace. ""Classics"" collects 11 songs from seven albums released between 1978 and 1986. The real high point is, of course, ""Magic Power"" from 1981's ""Allied Forces."" The song has a real beauty that is missing from the band's other work. The rest are relatively interchangeable, ranging from hard rocking to power ballads. As the 1980s progessed and metal heads began migrating either to hair bands like Motley Crue and Bon Jovi or underground acts like Metallica and Megadeath, Triumph became increasingly irrelevant.Overall, ""Classics"" is a decent anthology album from a band that was only occasionally triumphant."
3,Weak Greatest Hits Album From a Great Band,This album contains a sub-par set of hits from one of the best Canadian power trios. The only way I would recommend this album is if you are a raving fan and must have everything Rick and the boys have done. If you want to really get to the essence of what was Triumph I recommend 'Allied Forces' as their defining album. This compilation is just average.
4,"Triumph ""Classics""","Good album overall, a couple weaker songs, but overall really strong. I've enjoyed Triumph since my highschool days and this album brought back a lot a good memories."
1,Classic Triumph,How can you have a classics album without the classics? Not having the best of Allied Forces on the best of album is a shame. D-
1,It was a very bad.,It was broken and cracked up. It wasn't like what the seller said the condition it was suppose to be in. So I will not be buying anything from this seller every again.
2,"""Classics"" is not a Triumph","Don't get me wrong, I like Triumph. More specifically, I like Rick Emmet's vocals and guitar work. He's really pretty accomplished on the axe. However, this album has too much mediocre stuff with Gil Moore (the drummer/vocalist) as the singer - Tears in the Rain (fair), Spellbound (okay), I Live for the Weekend (lame), Follow Your Heart (okay) and Rock n Roll Machine (lame).The good stuff on this album is Hold On (great), Magic Power (good), World of Fanstasy (great), Fight the Good Fight (great), Somebody's Out There (good) and Lay It On the Line (absolutely the best song from this group). There are some other good songs that should be on this album (even stuff with Gil Moore singing lead - like Fool For Your Love) but it's not in here.I'd recommend getting Just A Game, Allied Forces and Never Surrender instead of this album. You'll get most of their best stuff in those three albums and some good songs not in this release."
2,Missing My Favorite Song,"When I was a teen I heard a song on the radio called ""When The Lights Go Down"" and I was blown away. It was Triumph. I got the Never Surrender album and liked the whole album. The other reviewers seem to agree with me that this greatest hits collection could have been much better. I think that anyone who calls themself a Triumph fan should go ahead and get the individual cd's and leave this greatest hits cd alone."
3,Just received,"I just received this book and can't really give the stars I would like but, I browsed through a few pages and it seems very interesting information. However, I would of love to see pictures along side the recipes. When I make a few of diferent recipes and read through the book I'll come back to write my findings. So far, all other reviews seem positive."
2,Pancakes,I've tried a number of the recipes and they have not been an improvement over the ones I'm already using.
5,Great Pancake Book,"This is a great pancake book. Had to buy a second one for my house because our 10 year old grandaughter took the book to her house, because she loves cooking breakfast from it. She loves making her specialty crepes."
5,wonderful product,Very much like this product. I remember when we had to use men's shaving cream that dried our skin out. This product is moisturizing and soft to the skin. I will not buy any other shaving cream. The gel is of preference as very little is needed and it expands to a large quantity.
2,Skintimate Moisturizing Gel - My Opinion,"I switched to this product because of good reviews, i was hoping it would be the answer to my dreams, namely a Gel which feels good on the skin, smells good and works great when shaving, unfortunately i have found this product less than ideal for my sensitive skin type, it makes my skin itch after using it, it also does not give the close shave i was hoping for, therefore i would advise people to check carefully before they buy, if their skin is sensitive they might wish to consider another product."
5,Good product,THis was recommended for my Havanesse whose black nose started to turn light during the winter. Works like a charm and I plan to keep using it year round.
3,OK product,"After using this product consecutively for 1 month, my dog's skin and coat had little to no change.Trying to use the rest up, I add it into her daily dry food for extra flavor when she does not want to eat or has not been eating regularly. It normally does the trick. I guess the taste of kelp isnt so bad after all.Brushing the dog daily does a better job than this kelp supplement to providing a smooth and healthy coat."
3,"Lacks the sparkle of ""Operation Chaos""","I loved Operation Chaos, and really looked forward to this book, but it didn't enthrall me the way the original book did. It just seems like things never take off, and I was never thrilled the way I was by the first book. The climactic ""quest"" (admittedly a poor choice of words, but I have none better) doesn't capture the imagination like the descent into Hell of the original, and climax seems short and unsatisfying. Not a bad book, and adequately readable, but it just isn't what it's predecessor was!"
2,Disappointing,"Anderson is one of the most prolific SF writers. His output, not surprisingly, is uneven. At its best, his work is very entertaining. His writing style, however, can be cloying and his characterizations thin. This is not one of this better efforts. Operation Luna is the belated (by decades) sequel to an entertaining series of linked stories published in book form as Operation Chaos. Where the older book had clever plotting and considerable humor, the plotting of this book is plodding and the writing often cliched. Readers who enjoy this type of romantic fantasy should find a copy of Anderson's Three Hearts and Three Lions, his best effort in this genre."
1,Beware! Re-recorded junk!,"If you like new re-recorded digital versions that DO NOT SOUND LIKE THE ORIGINALS, this one is for you. Otherwise, consider this garbage from one of those Canadian labels and bypass it."
1,A dangerous book,This is a dangerous book. As a paediatrician I have treated one patient whose parents followed the advice in this book. They fed their infant nothing but barley water and goats milk and he ended up with a severe blood disorder due to vitamin deficiency. He is lucky not to have been brain damaged. At least one child has died after his parents followed the advice of Adelle Davis and gave him potassium to treat infant colic (her estate was successfully sued). There have been numerous other instances of children becoming very sick from following her advice. Do not buy this book.
1,"Historical oddity, not sound medical advice.","In 1978, two month old Ryan Pitzer died when his mother followed the advice in this book, giving him about three-quarters of a teaspoon of potassium chloride to treat colic. Potassium chloride causes cardiac arrest in large doses. Why would Adelle Davis publish advice that actually kills people? Please don't follow the advice in this book unless a REAL doctor approves it."
3,Great material but way too short,"This tape only has 4 videos plus an interview. The chosen songs are good ones but I feel short-changed because the entire tape is only about 30 minutes long. The group has plenty of material, more should have been included on this tape. videos on this tape: Some Girls Do; The Walk; All These Years; Thank God For You."
3,They work,"Had to pick these replacement pins up after the one that came with the tool snapped. $15 for these is ridiculously overpriced, but what can you do? Should be priced about $4-5, at most.The pins work fine and I've used it several times and not broken another, maybe the one that came with the tool had a defect."
4,TWO (2) pins per pack,Why they don't state the quantity in the item description is beyond me. The part #CTP-C had 2 pins per pack when we received it. This despite the title and description reading 'Pin' (as in singular). Looks to be the exact silver colored pin used in the CT-3 tool.
3,Local colour in India is worth it!,"As an academic specialist on India, I very much enjoyed the India settings, mostly in Bangalore, Mysore, Madras (as it was then) .... The plot is OK, with much sex for those for whom the plot and local colour are insufficient. Worth a look at a budget price!"
2,Outdated,"This film was a bit outdated. Meth is a large problem in our area and our Drug Task Force does all they can, but when the criminals get to the justice system they just get a slap on the hand. Almost all Meth now is shake and bake so this film was before we had this issue."
3,Watch Out East Coast! Meth is Coming!,"The film does not ostracize and stigmatize meth addicts. Instead it displays meth as the menace next door, infiltrating and destroying small-town rural America. An epidemic reaching your neighbor, brother, uncle, or cousin. American Meth also examines the many sides and people involved in the struggle against the drug: the justice system, the addicts (""tweakers""), families, human service workers, politicians, etc.I wish they would have spent more time on the history of Meth, improved the sound and music quality of the film, and omitted many of the redundant interviews. Overall, I appreciate Hunt's observation of our country's Meth dilemma, especially since it is a drug that has had a pernicious impact on many of our communities in Washington state."
3,Informative,"If you can get past the mediocre quality of the production, the film itself has some a good message to convey."
4,The first half was interesting and informative,"The second half went into too much detail about one family's particular situation. I felt like I had a strong understanding of the sorts of problems facing the family after they had several minutes of screentime, and was disappointed that the documentary lost variety at that point and started feeling a bit like Jerry Springer.Still, I thought the first half of the movie was informative enough for it to warrant 4 stars."
2,Too optimistic,I thought it was a whitewash. The family featured in the 2nd half should have had those kids taken away long ago.
2,Preachy and repetitive,"A cast of meth addicts, law enforcement types and community treatment activists preach against the toll taken by meth. The message is repeated over and over, replete with gross-out closeups of the rotting teeth and pitted skin developed by the hard core meth addict. I'm not sure what the point of this film was, other than to be yet another anti-drug screed. I found it tiresome and ejected before the finish."
5,yummy chocolate,"i usually have m&m's in my bag or this. meiji makes my favorite chocolate. it just tastes really good, i grew up on this. it's addicting too because it's so small that you keep on wanting to get more. try it, it's really good, you wont be disappointed. i love choco baby!"
3,When life moved at a slower pace...,An interesting story that follows a woman throughout her lifetime. There was something very powerful about this novel that I can't quite put my finger on. It brings a longing for simple pleasures and the closeness of family. Fans of Fannie Flagg should enjoy this novel.
3,A haunting story that leaves you unfulfilled,"A novel beautifully written, very lyrical but yet a bit depressing. I found it very educational to read of life that depended on the land, however, it took me to a place that I thought was a very sad time for women to live in."
4,A Wonderful Collection,"Being a huge fan of Albee's work, the thought of having all of his plays collected in handsome hardcovers is a cause for celebration. I devoured this first collection with delight, and wait excitedly for the future volumes to be released. I did notice, however, some typographical errors that were disappointing in such an otherwise well produced edition, and I hope the people at Overlook will take better care with the future volumes. That aside, one can plainly see even with this early work that Albee was destined for immortality as a playwright."
1,more sophisticated dreck,"I've just read Zoo Story, one of the highly acclaimed plays in this book.I'd like my time refunded, please."
3,Good Beginning,This book contains basic information concerning handwriting and drawing interpretation. It is great for a beginner who does not have a lot of time for wordy text books.
3,"Decent beginning, not the best starting point","I recently bought this album for completion's sake, because I had read good things about it, and because it had been decades since I'd heard it. For many years it had seemed that there wasn't a lot of memorable material on it. On later albums Triumph progressed fairly steadily to their artistic peak at the ""Thunder Seven"" album, so there was never really a great need to have this ""origin issue"" in my collection.Having listened to this very nicely remastered album several times, things haven't changed too much. It's early Triumph and little more, which is fine. The most memorable and distinctive track is ""Blinding Light Show/Moonchild,"" but that song doesn't exactly bowl me over. Still, there are some worthwhile moments here, mostly in the first few tracks. As a starting point for discovering Triumph I'd recommend either (or both!) of the albums ""Rock and Roll Machine"" and ""Just A Game."""
2,Early Triumph release reflects bands roots,"Originally released in Canada in the mid 1970's, Triumph's ""In The Beginning"" CD traces the band's earliest work. Those familiar with the band may already be familiar with some of the Triumph songs that showcased as stage pieces during Triumph's heyday in the 70's and early 80's--Blinding Light Show and Rock & Roll Machine. Lyrically, this album, is a great disappointment compared to Triumph's later albums and the band's youth and inexperience is ever-present. If anyone has had the opportunity to listen to the ""Lay It on The Line' track from Triumph's ""Stages"" CD, the chord solo from ""Don't Take my Life"" will sound strangely familiar, and may enable you to make better sense of Triumph's musical evolution."
3,The Founding: Book Three,"Long after coming to learn that they have more in common than outward appearances would hint at, as well as having joined together to fight a common foe (the Pitar), the Human/Thranx now must fight the most dangerous of enemy. Themselves.Xenophobe Isolationist Extremists, both Thranx and Human, join together (the irony is not overlooked) to try and destroy the tightening bonds of the growing Commonwealth movement. Meanwhile, on a recently settled planet, unwitting humans are under attack from the devious AAnn. The Terrorist threats eventually dovetail, but sadly to do not come together as well as might have.ADF's final book in his Founding Trilogy is funny and entertaining, but lacks an energetic spark. His fans should enjoy it, but the tale could have been more."
2,Nonstick Surface Comes Off!,"I used this product one time -- grilled fish. It worked very well. The fish was cooked to perfection. The removeable handle worked well.However, when I started to clean the basket, after only one use, the black nonstick surface began to flake and come off. Mind you, I didn't srub or use harsh products. The nonstick surface came off with a little Sunlight soap and a sponge. I can't use it again because the surface comes off in the water, on the sponge, and on your hands. I'm sure that it will come off on your food.If you don't mind disposable kitchen tools, buy this product."
2,Won't fit all cribs,"I registered for this because I have the rest of the bedding set. However we have a convertible crib and since the sides have thicker wood than just a standard crib, it would not fit! The piece that holds it on was too large in diameter to fit where its supposed to. With no other alternatives for mounting properly, unfortunately we had to return it and our baby will have to do without a mobile."
2,"Very cute collection, but skip the mobile","I registered for the entire Locomotion collection before my son was born and have been very happy with it. I love the theme, but the mobile was a big disappointment. It didn't fit the crib properly and although my husband tried to figure out a way to install it without any type of conversion kit available, he just couldn't attach it safely and we ended up returning it. Also, although the mobile matches the theme, I found that the colors weren't very stimulating.We bought the Tiny Love Symphony In Motion Mobile instead and although the colors didn't match, our son got many months of enjoyment and stimulation out of it."
2,Mobile wont fit my crib,"I think the mobile is very cute, but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly. I tried attaching it in several differnt places. I am going to return it."
4,like it but it needs a remote,My Husband and I loved the look and shapes of the moblie. My Baby's face just lights up when he's placed in his bed for naps or night time. However we find ourself running back in forth so much because the cute little songs have stopped before he falls asleep. I was looking online and saw that some of these new mobiles have remotes on them. It would seem that with the all the new things that come out the manufactors would have given the public the option to have a wind up mobile or a remote mobile. I hope that someone from these places reads these and takes the time to put more thought into what parents would want in future purchases.But like as I said before we love the look and love they way my son reacts to it. So I'll look at this mobile being a weight loss bonus for all the running back and forth.
3,"Cute, but not functional with my crib","Initially I was reluctant to purchase this mobile, as it is on the pricey side (for something you can really only use for a few months). I made the purchase, however, as the mobile matched my nursery decor and was very cute. I was extremely disappointed when I got home and realized it would not fit on my crib. Unless you have a crib with slats all the way around (not a solid back or sides), this mobile will not work for you. For the price, I think there should be more versatility, especially from a manufacturer who produces a large volume for an exclusive baby retailer. I will be taking the mobile back today and using my Tiny Love Symphony in Motion Mobile that I saved from my first child's room."
2,Doesn't fit our crib,"Alas, we have the entire Locomotion set but the cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib. I called Babies R Us to see about some sort of conversion kit, but there's no such thing. I'll be returning it this weekend and getting some crib toys instead. :-("
4,Good Music,"The Commodores will never be the same without Lionel. As you will see on this cd, Lionel brought so much feeling to this group."
5,Sweet Love Baby,"Wore out two of these albums growing up. Great live album,almost puts you right in the seats in front of the band."
4,This functioned very well,The only problem is the instructions for connecting the dimmer switch are not as clear as they should be. To properly connect the switch you need to remove the cover housing and Identify which wire is listed as (in) and (out) In being (line in) are the small terminal on plug or black wire (Hot side) (Out) will go the Black wire to lamp/ white wire from lamp will connect to white wire large side plug connector . If connected in another fashion will experience the a board short making the switch unusable
3,SKB Sculptured Violin Case,"This item was shipped in a timely manner and arrived in good condition. I wasn't fond of the actual product, though. It had a cheap feel to it, although it looked like it was built soundly. I didn't like the bow holders. Instead of the spinners, it just had a rubber piece that clasped over the frog. But the clasps that hold the case looked well-built and like they'd last a long time."
1,Not what I expect.,"I got mine today. I'm very upset, totally disappointed. First of all, instead of an aluminum ""carrying case"", it is a tin. Totally different from the picture shown on the site. Then, I open it up and there aren't any wood boards. They are just MDF boards with sticker on the both sides. All the games pieces are plastic. It is very cheaply made and gives nothing what the product description claim.[...]."
3,"good, but.....","I liked the wooden game board, but some of the pieces were a bit disappointing. The mancala pieces were slighly bigger than cooked grains of rice and they're hard to handle when they're that little. The checkers were on the small side, which is ok, but when you're ""kinged"" and have to have your checkers stacked, they fall off really easily. But I do like that the boards are wooden and durable. I can always replace or change the pieces if I need to. It's not all bad. The case is nice."
4,Pretty good little flashlight,I have had a few of these for a number of years. I like to keep one in my pocket for general purpose. They are small and bright. I think the bulbs may have a problem with the higher voltage on a lithium ion battery though.
2,Useless for diving,"As another reviewer here has noted, this light is worthless for diving applications. In spite of being advertised as waterproof and sold in dive shops, mine flooded at a mere 40 feet of depth. Furthermore, the salt water corroded the light's circuitry, rendering it worthless.If you can keep yours dry, you'll likely have better experiences than I did, but this item should not be marketed as waterproof."
3,"bright, but eats batteries quick","not much else to say except don't leave this thing on long. I find it works well for quick ( like less than 15 seconds quick) uses. It's pretty bright for its size, and isn't too big to throw in your pocket."
1,Not a diving backup light!,"It says on Princeton Tech website these are waterproof up to 300ft/100m. I ordered 2 of these, both were flooded on the first dive at approx 100ft/30m. These are not diving lights, don't waste your money if you need a backup diving light!"
5,Childhood favorite!,"I remember renting this book from the library over and over again when I was a child. I remembered Pippa one day and thought I would try to find that book that was so much a part of my childhood. Apparently it is not in print any longer, but the used version was almost better! It brought back a lot of memories of my childhood...hours spent dreaming what it would be like to live in a small mouse world!"
2,Completely overrated,"Rarely do I end up buying junk with all the researching I do prior to making a purchase, but this time I got duked. This thing is a pile of junk. The latching mechanism is a joke, there is no mechanism. The door is just a bit bigger than the housing, so the door overlaps the housing and that's the seal. If there's any kind of warping or anything, it's not going to close properly. I can generally get anything like this to work properly but this thing is just a pile of junk. For the price compared to $100 mailboxes I guess most people will find it sufficient, but if you insist on quality, this is not the mailbox for you. Actually, if you want it, buy it from me! If you're in the Bay Area, $10 and it's yours. It has holes on the side now from where I mounted it to the side of another (larger) one."
2,Hard to open and close,"Unit relies on a tight fit on the door to keep it closed. It is hard to open and close. I have concerns that when it gets a little worn, it may not stay closed. My next mail box will have a spring latch."
3,meh...,"The product came in a timely manner which was nice. However, it was not well packaged for shipping. It had a large dent in the side when it arrived. It was inexpensive, which is evident in the quality. It has a little flimsy flag that I would'nt trust its use for long. Also, the opening door needed to be slammed to close. Well, now its my nifty laundry room trash bin! yay!"
3,Nice and Big,"I only gave it 3 stars because when I received it,and took it out of box, it has 3 dents. I am not returningit because i have a mailbox cover that will hide the dents. Needs to ship with better packing."
4,Solid Mailbox,"I purchased this mailbox to replace a plastic one that was starting to crack. This is a large, sturdy mailbox. My only complaint is that maybe it is a little too long. I typically pull up to my mailbox and if the mail is towards the back, I have to open the door and get out to reach it. On the flip side, because it is a little larger, it does easily hold smaller packages which saves the mailman a trip to the porch."
4,Shades of Gray,"This is a good quality mailbox. Very sturdy. This will probably last for many years (as long as some idiot doesn't use it for target practice, like they did our last one). Mailboxes are very simple items, if they're well-made and sturdy, like this one is, you can't ask for much more. The only thing that annoyed me a little is the color. It's more like ""dark gray"" with a hint of green than actually being green. Even the retail box it came in shows a picture of a distinctly green mailbox, but then you pull it out of the box and you get a little surprise. So if you don't mind ""dark gray"" with a hint of green, it should be fine."
3,MAILBOX,Amazon is the most amazing site to work with and with so much comfort and ease. Unfortunately they do not make the mailboxes in a smaller size anymore so we had to settle on the larger one. This took some work as the pole that it is attached to also needed revisions. But overall this was not your fault and we are always pleased with your timely service.Barbara Herbert
2,Too big!,"My daughter ordered this and didn't check the dimensions. When we got it, it was way too big....I would like to return it, but don't know how. Can you help?"
2,Steel with Aluminum Flag....HOWEVER.....,"I purchased this mailbox IN APRIL 2012 because it had an aluminum flag. Our last mailbox had a plastic flag that broke off in less than a year. HOWEVER.....THIS FLAG IS AFFIXED WITH A PLASTIC PART THAT BROKE LAST WEEK! So, if you are trying to avoid failing plastic parts, this is not the mailbox for you."
4,Great product but no mounting brackets,"I got this to replace my, what I now know to be standard sized, mailbox that the mailman finally told me had to go. It came quickly and was much larger than I expected, but that ends up working to my advantage.One important note: the mailbox does not come with any mounting brackets or anything to attach it to the post with. That's all up to you. Fortunately, I could use my old mounting brackets, but that is something that really should be disclosed in the description. The lack of mounting brackets, etc. is the only reason I couldn't give the product 5 stars."
5,Grrr8!,"This box met all of my expectations. It's greater size is extremely useful and it was much cheaper at Amazon (especially with the shipping kicked in), than picking up one at my local building supply stores. Although it has a much larger capacity than the standard size box, the width was well within a comfortable size to be able to install it on the old standard size post mount. Extremely well built and should last a long, long time."
4,Large Rural Mailbox,"Just what we needed. Service excellent, product was perfect. Easy to install.Looks very nice on the mailbox post. Very sturdy."
1,Did not hold up,"After only six months, this mailbox is coming apart at the bottom seam. A steel mailbox ought to last many years."
3,Not the true color,In the picture this mailbox looks to be a nice shade of green. What we got was a very dark moss green. We were trying to match the mailboxes in our pickup area but ours ended up to be obviously a lot darker.
5,Secure and durable,"Large mailbox, very secure and durable. Now I don't have to go out to meet the mail carrier just to get boxes, they fit in my mailbox perfectly."
4,Hanger is something thats not for everyone,"Hanger is something thats not for everyone. but if your a fan of the directors last movie Gutterballs you will like this movie. this flick is depressing,hardcore,and sometimes right to the bone gross and if you like films that pull no punches like nekromantik, Cannibal holocaust, or even last house on dead end street then this flick might be for you."
3,Could be better,"Nicholson's Hanger arrived here the other day. On one hand, it pays great homage to Troma films (and Kaufman even makes an appearance). And, viewing through that lens, a viewer might love the film. It emulates Troma works even better than Slither did. Hanger has the guts to push boundaries concerning sex & violence. It will shock you (I would think). On the other hand, the work is entirely gross-out horror with neither engaging plot nor scares nor sympathetic characters nor smart ideas. It is a turd. It is disgusting and repulsive, but not horrifying. Hanger is not a shock horror classic such as Evil Dead, NOTLD, Re-Animator, Friday the 13th, or Toxic Avenger. It is not as good or fun as Gutterballs. FX-master Nicholson provides constant nasty effects and props, but little story and substance. This horror comedy is a comedian who is dirty but neither funny nor witty. That is my review."
3,"Wow, pimps mongoloids and hoes.","This is truly one of the most over the top and offensive movies I have ever set through. I think there are some funny lines coming from the father of Hanger that add to the almost unwatchable gorefest and this keep me hanging in there. The over the top sex or what passes as sex was almost porno and is not for the easily offended. I think I am pretty jaded but man oh man this was almost to much for me. Written and directed by Ryan Nicholson , how proud he must be. A must see for the truly hard core gore fans and the rest should move on."
4,This should become a cult classic.,"The abortion scene and the tampon scene make this movie incredibly memorable and worth recommending to watch for gore fans...the movie does a nice job with its old school gore effects (e.g stage magic). Unfortunately, several scenes run-on making you want to hit the FF button, some scenes shouldn't even be in the movie and much of the dialogue needs tighten up, as far as the acting goes...well, its b-move, what else do you expect?! Overall a good story and a CLASSIC as far as im concerned.Its an interesting film free from Hollywood product placement influence and has an original plot...this is a quality gore-sleaze-urban gothic-horror movie. Not for the squeamish (even if you like 'slasher' films) nor for the kiddies!"
1,Guatemala & Belize map,"The quality of the paper and the appearance of the map are great. The map itself is useless. I don't know what they used for data or if they had it checked before publishing it but, on a recent trip to Guatemala, it proved to be full of errors. In one case it showed a road as paved which has never been paved and for which there are no present plans to pave. I drove the road and it is only suitable for high clearance, rugged vehicles. Another section of road shown as dirt has been paved for years. I had planned to take another road shown as paved but was told by locals that it was not paved and only suitable for SUV's and pickups. If a map does not reliably show roads, their location and type and if it has numerous geographical references wrong, it's not the worth the beautiful paper it's printed on. As a result of my experience I do not recommend this series of maps."
2,Disappointed with freshness,These candy bars were not very fresh. Of course they are Wunderbars and still taste pretty good! They end up costing quite a bit which would be fine if they were fresh!
4,"Tiger, Tiger - Really Good","It has been so long since I read this but I do remember that I really enjoyed it. The characters were great and who wouldn't enjoy thinking about what it would be like to own a tiger as a pet. This book also takes you to a time when Christianity was still coming about and the Coliseum was still used as entertainment. A fun book and anyone who loves animals, tigers, or ancient history I think would enjoy this book."
5,great book,I found the book very interesting. I've underestimated the power of the pen. Wonderful and insightful.
1,"Soulless, corporate rock. Yech!","The followup to the Canadian rock trio's brilliant ""Just A Game"" is pure, soulless, commercial dreck. Drummer Gil Moore musta taken over control of the sound, because if you listen carefully to each Triumph album, you'll realize he rarely contributed a musical highlight. Avoid at all costs."
4,"MORE THAN JUST A GAME, IT IS A PROGRESSION OF POWER!","As A long time fan of Triumph, I first had mixed opinions of the 'Progressions of Power' ellpee, but I am know convinced that the majority of the tracks are incredible musical works of art that, to just disregard this particular album as not worthy enough for ears to hear is completely narrow-minded. Just because there is not one song that had any radio air play does not mean that the music is horrible. 'I Can Survive' and 'Hard Road' are just two of the compositions that really combine all of the elements that make up an excellent song that is truly powerful and will live on forever."
3,Remastered early Triumph CD,"This is a remastered version of Triumph's fourth album. The sound engineering is superb. The sound is crystal clear, a distinct improvement over the previous version of this CD. Unfortunately, the music is a little uneven. There are some inspired songs, notably Hard Road, but also a certain amount of filler. Triumph did not really break through until their fifth release, Allied Forces, which was consistently stronger."
2,Ok.......,"This is an okay toy... It doesn't do much but growl,hiss, and purr at you. I wouldn't recommend that you buy this toy if you're looking for something that will keep you entertained for hours."
2,"Nice toy, but not what I expected.","I got a micropet as soon as they came out. I was thrilled with them for the first couple weeks, but then I started to get bored. They were doing the same thing each day, and for a kid, we don't want that. They were also very small, and get lost easily. I've had mine for a year, and when I just started to look for it again. It was lost.I wouldn't reccomend this toy for various reason.-Gets lost esily-same thing each day-noisy-goes all over the place-doesn't listen (as it says it does)-ect."
3,Good...but wasnt what I expected,"I bought this toy when it first came out! I was SO EXCITED because I have been on neopets for a very long time. Around then, i got hacked, so I started a new account. Well...I bought this toy, and it doesnt even walk! It just hisses and purrs! It wasnt at all what I expected!"
3,It's OK,"It's adorable, and if you like neopets, you'll like it! BUT all it does is make strange noises alot, and it sometimes cuts you off while talking, or hisses when you sweet-talk to it. I thought they spoke a bit, not just purred and hissed. And it moves it's head only. It would have been cooler had I expected less of it, but if your standards are high or you want something to keep you occupied for days, it's not for you. If you want Neopets merchandise, I'd buy a Pocket Pet or the TCG game."
2,Terrible,Please don't buy this toy.I can't get it off the stand and all it does is repeat a patturn of noises!Please don't purchase this toy it is not really voice activated.
4,"Unclaimed gold, at least 14k...","A wonderful example of mid 60s romantic and slightly screwball comedy, the late great Jim Hutton of Where the Boys Are fame, supported by a perfect cast, show what Americans both wanted and feared in the 60s--love and in-laws. If you don't like it, blame me, or your own closed-mindedness."
4,Works!,"Works the Abs great! Make sure when using, its done correctly. If not, you could get back pain."
5,Great Product,Kills your abs... in a good way! ;)Highly recommended to anyone that wants to get a nice 6 pack
4,It does its job,"This product does everything I need it do, but if it was beefier and felt a little more sturdy I would like it a lot more."
5,So Easy a Caveman Could Do It,Simple. Easy. Works. Hurts my back when I do it wrong so there's your indicator. Slap it together and start rolling into some new abs. You have to eat better and exercise (hard) to get good abs. You know this though.
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"Solidly built, easily assembled. It's probably the same as any competing product out there, but for less than $10. You can't argue with the price."
3,Pretty Good,"hi, i bought this ab wheel to lose my belly and get hard rock abs. after i bought it, it was actually very easy to assemble it, and also to use it. if your a beginner you have to get used to your balance and strength. One more thing, it does not only work your abs, it tones your whole upper body, especially your arms. you will feel very sore after you do about 50 of them..i would highly recommend this product to any beginners."
4,really fun ab workout,"this thing is actually pretty fun. i know, you think ab workout, and you dont think of the word fun. but i have been rolling around in the office and i have been having a ball."
3,impartial just yet.,"I bought this, knowing it wasn't going to work over night. I have had a simmilar one when i was 17, as it was easier, simply cause my body was more inshape! I have a bad back and thought crunches hurt, so maybe this wont be as bad. BOTTOM LINE if your older, out of shape, have poor posture doing push ups (yes i meant push-ups)then this may not be for you, just yet, or even at all. If your one who can never find great positioning when doing push ups, or have the arm stregnth to do a curl on a bar (then your probably not going to have the stregnth to bring back your body back to itself from the wheel) Over all when done correctly, the product is super good,you can feel it!I just felt I was working out on my hands/back because i couldnt make my body form to the correct posture initially (there are good diagrams in the booklet)*"
3,"Does what it's supposed to do, BUT...","...the handles smell strongly like tires. Not only do the handles smell like tires, but the smell gets into your skin and won't easily wash out. It took frequent hand washings and the better part of a day for that awful smell to fade. So, do yourself a favor and cover each handle with a dry washcloth (or something) while using."
5,You'll feel it,"I added this to my home routine to give myself some variety. There are a million different ab workouts you can do. The ab wheel works great. Just don't over do it in the beginning. By extending too far too quickly you could experience some discomfort. You definitely need to work up to the full extension at multiple reps. Like others have said, form is important. Pros: fairly inexpensive, it's light weight, doesn't take up too much storage space and works well."
4,"It works, but you've got to use it.","I have a similar two-wheel roller, purchased back in the 1960's for about the same cost -- wheels a tad wider, but that doesn't affect how it works. This is a great aid for strengthening and toning back, abdomen, arms, and thighs, as you get down on your knees and roll the unit back and forth -- and you decide just how far back and forth you can go comfortably -- you still get the benefits. (And if you find yourself lying on the floor, it just means you went too far forward -- lighten up a little!)P.S.: yes, my old one still works beautifully after 40-odd years, and this one should last years too."
3,my boyfriend DID love it,"at first I was a little worried about buying this after reading some reviews, but i bought it anyways and im VERY glad i did. This ab wheel is perfect, EASY to assemble (for me at least. Lots of other reviews people said it was super hard to put the handles on, which was not the case for me, the wheel is a bit small but that doesnt bother me, or my bf at all, and it rolls with ease. I do recommend this to anyone who wants a good hard workoutupdate 12/2012bought this about 2 years ago. He stopped using it after a while! Said that because it was small it made his back hurt. Maybe his back was dipping but he insists that because your arms have to come in so close that his back could not support enough. I wonder if there was a wider one would it be less stress on the back!"
4,Good workout,It takes some getting use to and its best if you place a yoga mat or something with a bit cushion under your knees. In the beginning you will feel a little unbalanced but as your abs strengthen so will your balance.
4,A great value,A terrific price for a pretty basic item. It works well and it wasn't too expensive. Two thumbs up!
5,works,This ab wheel makes you work your abs - as promised. Haven't used it to the level they recommend for dramatic improvement but I can feel it.
3,"Great workout, but I turned into Mel Gibson in Lethal Weapon","This product is a cheap and easy way to get a GREAT core workout.Really beats your abs into shape. Or it would if I kept using it.Ok, so it's been a while since I've watched any of the Lethal Weapon movies, but remember Martin Rigg's shoulder would always crap out on him in every movie? Yeah that's kinda what happened to me after using it for 2.5 weeks. I would slam my shoulder against walls and pillars because it hurt so much, and I would call my wife and cuss her out over the phone because the pain made me go crazy.I'm guessing the human shoulder isn't meant to handle that kind of weight and stress.I have no doubts about the effectiveness of this product though.But perhaps it's not for everyone. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has strong shoulders.I can not wait for the next Mel Gibson movie."
2,FOAM GRIPS???,"FOAM grips??? How about hard rubber. These don't have FOAM grips by any stretch of the imagination. The wheel tread is the same very hard rubber. They should've gone the extra mile and put real foam grips on; I would've been happy to pay the extra money to have it be foam like the ab wheel at my gym. I was really disappointed. I think this is false advertising. It does do what it's supposed to do, I just think they should've said 'hard rubber grips'."
3,"Works well, but largely unnecessary","This device certainly gives a good muscle burn, and actually works the lower back more than the abdominals. This is something to consider if you have back problems.Now, while this device IS indeed effective at what it does, after having used it, (with other abdominal exercises,) for a number of months, I can say that a good number of bicycle crunches, reverse crunches, and plank exercises will just as effectively work your abdominal muscles, for free.To get the flat tummy we all want, I am afraid no machine is going to be a magic bullet, (since you cannot spot-reduce,) and this is one more example of that."
5,not as easy as I thought,Pretty cool..simple to use ....use a wall to shorten how far you go...you have to build up to do a complete move...
5,"Inexpensive, Sturdy, Simple, Yet Effective",I bought one of the original seen on tv Abslides a few years ago. That model is larger than the Valeo and has a spring system that tightens when you extend. It also has small wheels that get dust and carpeting caught in them.The Valeo Dual Ab Wheel is easy to assemble and it is much simpler. It is also a lot smaller. It is sturdy and it works the core and the arms. Going to either side works the obliques as well. You can't beat the price and free shipping with amazon.
4,Feeling tough?,"I had a friend who spent sometime in prison and told me this was a popular item there in the gym. So, I ordered it. You need something under your knees when you use this like a yoga mat or carpet. It is not easy, but I feel the pain. No pain no gain!"
3,It kind of hurts my back,It's hard to use this thing properly and it just feels kind of cheap and plastic and it doesn't give me the burn that I'm looking for in my abs and I'm afraid that I'm hurting my back with it.
5,Worked exactly as advertised,"I wanted something that I wouldn't have to invest time in setting up, would not fall apart, and would work well. This did all of the above. I put it together in 2 seconds, everything was a breeze, and it works well. Great product for what I was looking for."
4,Simple & Affordable,"I read reviews on this product and had mixed feelings. The double wheel for stability sold me on it. People who claimed that it was challenging to build are wrong. Unless a defect, it was a very simple step to build it. It would be a 5-star if the handles were a made of foam, it hurts a bit when trying to get a grip after awhile. But with consisent practice, you will see results. You feel the burn. Start off from a wall, and slowly work your way back. Be cautious of lower back sufferers. Still a great and cheap AB product.**I recently traveled, and the hotel I stayed in had this wheel in their gym, so its good enough**"
3,Good Addition for A Home Gym,I have this as part of my workout equipment in my home gym. It is such a basic concept but a great work out tool.
2,Not the best tool for the job,"I got it today. Its a real hassle to assemble, I was very persistent and managed to put it together in a concentrated effort. It actually may be impossible for some users to assemble.The rubber tubes providing hand support and hold the central wheels in place are very difficult to put on. Also the central wheels are a little shaky since there is nothing really to hold them in place and their base is not very wide. This is a very strange design choice. I have seen other products that worked much better.Other then that it seems to be working ok."
1,ab wheel,i wouldnt waste your money it was a pain putting it togeather and it fell apart fast you want abs do sit ups cause this product wont help
4,Does actually work.,"While the Ab Wheel I received does not have the same handles as that in the product photo (mine has rubber handles and the logo peeled off after a week), this product does actually work (if used correctly). After the first use, I definitely felt it in my abs the next day. Careful though, if you're on the heavy side (like myself) don't be too gun-ho about slimming down, you will pull some muscles after the first use."
2,"Poor Quality, Safety Hazard","I purchased one of these Valeo ab wheels about a year ago. The third time I let my workout partner use it it, she fell and the spokes snapped apart, because the two wheels broke they each curved and my partner fell on her face. The quality of the plastic material the spokes of the wheels are made of could most definately be improved. My partner is a fit woman and only weighs about 130 pounds if that. I was shoked to see the condition of the wheels after she fell. I recently purchased a higher quality wheel with a solid center wheel and it has been wonderful."
1,broke after light use,"Very thin plastic, I weigh 185 pounds and mine broke after about 30 , 1 minute, light-duty uses. Not recomended."
2,Cheap materials,The tread on the wheels is actually hard plastic. The handle bars too are made of hard plastic so it is uncomfortable after awhile. There is a plastic smell on the handles too which makes your hands smell. Putting it together wasn't that difficult but overall it is obvious the quality is just not there.
4,Good for core work,"It's good since it has 2 wheels for added stability. Handles are ok. Too bad I stopped working abs (LB squats, Deads and Presses work them fine now)."
4,Okay,"Very easy to put together, and supports a fair amount of weight. Con: handles not cushioned so not the most ergonomic ab wheel out there but gets the job done."
2,not sure about this,Looks like it might work but I need to have someone watch me for the proper form. The directions indicated that proper form is a must to get results and it's had to know you have proper fork unless you have some one watch you do it! Pretty cheap so no harm no foul as far as that goes...if it dosent work then Im only out $10
3,Shmeh,"Well, it's cheap simple, and doesn't take up very much room, but I haven't found it to be as effective as just a 10 minute pillates ab routine. So, shmeh- It's fine I guess. Yeah. It's fine."
2,cheaply made,this product is cheaply made it is not made to support grown men. it is all plastic and feels flimsy definitely not reccommended if you plan on using product more than once a year.
3,Ok for cheap wheels,The quality isn't so great on this product. I was 1/2 an hour late to work today because I was trying to learn how to use it. It's pretty much the worst unicycle I've ever had and almost impossible to ride.
1,Cheap product,"For the price, I was expecting more. This is only cheap plastic, with a pipe and bicycle grips.Because the concept of exercising the abs works, I will not return it, however, this is as ripped-off as I have been in modern history. The product should sell for approx <$5 at most."
1,Paper quality leaves to be desired,"Like other reviewers, I noticed the smudges left on the page after erasing just once (I use 2B pencils for light marking). I ended up printing some staffs on laser printer quality paper using the same spacing and voila! Now if the manufacturer was willing to fix this issue by using higher quality paper instead of the cheapest recycled material, I wouldn't have to go through the trouble. The other alternative is to buy higher quality medium: Rhodia and Clairefontaine come to mind if you can find those here, the latter brand being somewhat more affordable."
1,I ordered for Catch A Falling Star on 4/26 & haven't rec'd,I ordered & paid for Catch A Falling Star on 4/26 through Paypal. I've e'd the seller a few times with no results! I won't deal through him again.
3,Bought for the instrumentals,"My review is a qualified one: I am a big fan of Rik Emmett's guitar playing and I bought this used for the two instrumentals: Midsummer's Daydream and Little Boy Blues. I've always considered Triumph to be a serviceable 80s hard-rock band: technically proficient and competent in songwriting, but just not my favorite."
4,A gift enjoyed,"This is not my cup of tea, but it was very well received by the person to whom I gave it. She had requested it and was overjoyed when it arrived so quickly. I was pleased to be able to provide it."
2,SOLD OUT,"TRIUMPH sold out in this album, but it was already late to survive in the fast changing scene of mertal-hard rock..."
4,If you buy only one Triumph CD this year ...,"Easily the best disc from the Canadian power trio that is not Rush. Not a bad tune on here. Interesting lyrics and stellar production. I used the track ""Little Boy Blues"" as demo tune while working in a stereo shop in the mid-80's. It sold a lot of speakers."
4,Triumph - Thunder Seven,"Superb album if you long for the soft side of hard rock 80 and 90ies style. In their time, Triumph was probably the best band in Canada if you ask me."
4,19 months old and going strong....,"We got this set for our baby shower and we loved it even more than the pictures. Our son is now 19 months and we still love it.He has though ripped off one of the ties from standing on it, but it took a beating before it gave out.We plan on using it when he moves to a big boy bed."
5,Couldn't be any cuter!,"When I found out I was having a boy, I was determined not to be roped in to the cartoon or pastel bedding I frequently saw for babies. When I saw this set, there was no doubt in my mind that it was perfect for my son. My Mom bought us everything in the locomotion category and we just recently set it up in the nursery (baby due in July) and it is such great quality and the colors are perfect. I would highly recommend this set."
5,Thrilled to order online,"I live in a small town far from any BabiesRUs, and I was very skeptical about ordering this bedding sight unseen online, but when it got here, I was more than pleasantly surprised! The quality of the bedding was even better than I had hoped. The colors were perfect ""boy"" colors, and the sheet included was so soft! I cannot put into words how happy I am with the decision to order this set, as it is just what I was looking for. I am sure that this will be used for a long time."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I liked this better than my rating indicates but only because I was born in Australia and have ""rellies"" there, and that made the story more interesting to me than it would have otherwise been. The other reviewer made me realize some important points that were made in the story, but when I read it, I saw only my personal interest in Australia being gratified, for the plot was too simple to be satisfying, and the characters less interesting than those of most Trollope books. But the picture of ""the bush"" in Australia at that time of history was really well rendered, and for that reason I don't regret the time spent reading this book. If you've never read Trollope, however, don't start here (unless you, too, have a strong interest in Australia)."
1,A Must-Read For W Fans,"If you are a fan of Bush, you owe it to yourself to get this book. It will tell you everything you ever wanted to hear."
1,They Overestimated Him,"One can only imagine how embarassed the authors are at this point in time (2008). They should have given Boy Bush a few more years in the saddle before she threw the word ""genius"" his way, and decided to present his obvious weaknesses as ""strengths."" But like so many other self-delusionals, they were probably in thrall to ""The Decider"" after 9/11 scared them senseless, and absolutely giddy when he heroically landed on the USS Abraham Lincoln. But he was always an intellectually incurious, stubbornly self-righteous moron more than willing to surround himself with yes men instead of talent, and while remaining devoid of any real understanding of or respect for the US Constitution and the rule of law. To say nothing of our military, which he has used to lay waste to Iraq in what can only be described as a vanity war. The smirking chimp will occupy the bottom rung of the presidential ratings ladder forever."
5,Great insight!,"What a great idea for a book. Love 'em or hate 'em, a politician's success depends on his ability to lead. Clearly, Bush has led brilliantly. And now his strategies have been uncovered and identified for anyone to follow in any endeavor. My two favorite chapters are about identifying values and bringing in the right people -- definitely worth the price of the book!"
1,A Hero's Story to Snooze By,"Ben Carson is an amazing person, and this video is equally amazing...it is horrifically boring! I am teaching this man to my students and, despite my interest in him, I still fell dead asleep. This is the greatest antidote to insomnia since Waterworld (but that's another review)! Save your money, save your time, save your sanity---buy another video!"
4,"Arresting, inventive visual storytelling, if a bit overlong","A bit pretentious, a bit obvious, overlong, even at 74 minutes (this would have beena brilliant 40 minute short), but still full of arresting images and surprisingly emotional moments.Influenced heavily by Kubrick, Antonioni and most of the great 60s and 70s visualists, thisis a wordless film about two robots who want to become human. The action is minimal.The opening drive through the desert alone takes a good 15 minutes.But it's wonderfully shot, and the use of eclectic source music as score (Brian Eno,Curtis Mayfield, etc) is interesting, if sometimes a little too self-conscious or intrusive.I doubt there are more layers to be found on repeated viewings, I think it is whatit is: an experimental film more full of image than story or ideas. A 74 minute, interesting rock video.But every time I'd head toward terminally bored, an image or feeling would reel me back in..."
3,I was 12 OK.,"If you were a bored 12 year old in the mid-70s this wasn't bad. At the time of it's airing I liked it. Early to mid 70s sci-fi on TVfrankly sucked. This was much more interesting then most of what I remember watching back then. The DVD is broken into two stories.The first story of the clone colony was fair. Dated. It seemed to have borrowed from ""Zardoz"" a bit. The second story of the animal preserve was more interesting. Seemed more original then the first story. If tried today as a series, who knows. Maybe two sesaons. I liked it enough to keep on the shelf. View as you will."
1,Give this one a pass,"STRANGE NEW WORLD is another two pilots for the GENESIS II/PAX series that Gene Roddenberry tried to get the networks to buy. Unlike the other two pilots he made for this idea, these two pilots stank to high heaven. Poorly scripted, badly acted, with minimal budget, these two pilots (in STRANGE NEW WORLD) should not have been made. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage (I wish that I hadn't). PLANET EARTH and GENESIS II were GOOD pilots, and if you're looking for a Roddenberry effort along these lines, pick these two items up instead."
1,NOT WHAT YOU THINK... AT ALL!,"Although this is our man, Scott Walker, the genius behind TILT and the SCOTT 1 through 4 collection, this is him when he was about eight years old, singing lame jingles in a prepubecent voice. It's sad that you can buy this but many of his albums from the seventies are unavailable.If you like Betty Boop songs, get this. If you want to hear the equivolent to the Backstreet Boys back before you were born, get this. If you simply must have everything by Walker, even something this hoaky, then fine, get it. But if you have even an iota of musical taste, then run from this, screaming!"
5,I lalalike it!,"Ok, I admit I'm nuts about Scott but seriously, whoever gave this CD 1 star is wrong.Geez,would you diss cartoons too?I think it's an interesting and often rewarding collection and I absolutely enjoyed it.Just listen to the samples!"
3,a fun but disappointing book,"I don't think this is a book of facts somebody screwed up. A lot of the facts are just common beliefs which, taken completely literally, aren't correct, which shouldn't be a big surprise. (Like, ""doughnuts do not have holes."") Much of it is filled with interesting facts. But I was still disappointed, since a lot of the facts I knew already, and the author doesn't provide a lot of information about each fact. Still, it's a fun book, although irritating at times.. I was hoping for something with a little more weight."
5,A sometimes hilarious insight to how things really happened,"This book is an excellent view of our world, and how we thought it was, yet it actually shows you how it truly is. Can't follow me? That's the reason I had to get the book.I just cannot believe how many times I read the book and thought to myself, ""I wonder what else I have been taught (or thought) has been absolutely wrong the whole time!!!"
3,Lesbian love in the 50's,"As with most books dealing with lesbian love in the 50's, this book seems to say 'yes, there was lesbian love affairs, but the female were really straight'. So, love between to females was a passing fancy and thus the book got by the censors and the USPS"
5,The Babe in old St. Pete.,"What makes this mystery a stand out is it's sense of history and of place. You get the feeling that Irby, a professor, knows every building in old St Pete, has read every newspaper article, spent months in archives and in the library. His encompassing knowledge of the rough, free-wheeling twenties seeps in to every scene-the mystery, the love story, and the adventure all play out against a lively, realistic backdrop. Plus, it's got the Babe in it. You can't beat that. Check this book out. It's worth it."
2,not the best,I did not like the taste of the shells and cheese. Way too salty and just didn't taste quite right. Very disappointing.
1,Stay away!,"This item has hidden MSG, an excitotoxin that kills brain cells. It is hidden in the calcium caseinate. Do your homework...the information is out there."
2,nothing new,i love to see cw on the top 40.it is truly american music.i miss charlie rich and roy orbison.
1,"She thinks my ""what"" is sexy?","I am very disturbed about the video of She thinks my tractor's sexy. It is unappropriate for the younger listeners and viewers. My 9 year old granddaughter said to me, ""Grandma, that's not very nice, she's trying to grab his pants."" Enough said!"
2,this one is o.k.,"There's very few country music I really care for, but this one I really like.He did a good job on this one."
1,Horrible!!!,"This is the most gutless, homogenized, tripe that I've heard in a long time. What kind of people actually like this? Has this guy ever listened to a single country record, or just Elton John? Don't buy this, buy Robbie Fulks instead."
2,Ho Hum! Boring!,"If it wasn't for the inclusion of ""You Had Me from Hello,"" this collection would be totally useless. However, that song is good, but the rest exemplifies what's wrong with a lot of these cookie cutter country studs. They try and get by on their looks and sounding so much alike that it's hard to tell one from the other. Kenny is certainly not one of the best! His ""She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy"" is one of the worst country recordings I've ever heard!"
3,Average.,"There is nothing wrong with the cd, I only gave it three stars because I only liked a few of the songs. If you are a real Kenny Chesney fan, you won't be disappointed."
5,Another Great Album.,"I Have This CD At Home. Kenny Does Have Talent In His Songs Like: ""What I Need To Do"" The 6 Week #1 Hit ""How Forever Feels"". I Saw The Video For ""She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy"". Kenny Had His Hands Around This Woman In The Video. The CD Also Contains ""You Had Me From Hello"" Another #1 Hit."
4,Solid Effort,"""You Had Me From Hello"" is got to be one of the most enjoyable country songs I have heard. My overall rating reflects how much I like this one song. The rest of the album is fairly average with the exception of ""How Forever Feels"" and ""Baptism."" I would like to hear more variability and emotion in the artist's voice; however, he does nothing particularly wrong. I hope he takes his performance to a higher level on his next album."
1,This CD stinks!,"I really enjoyed the song's ""How Forever Feels"" and ""You Had Me From Hello"" so I decided to get it. I'm sorry I did. This CD is really quite gross. From the spotlight on just ""Baptism"" to the sick suggestions of ""She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy"", I don't like this one. I am sorry I bought this Cd and through it and his music videos I have discovered that he has just about no moral sense at all. This is a definite no buy!"
1,WOW,"I'm really surprised what people will keep buying. This album seems less like real music from the heart and more like a fill in the blanks. ""You Had From Hello"" is one of the most boring musical pieces I've heard in a long time. I cringe when I hear it on the radio and hide in shame when I realize that I bought the CD. The only solace I can find is in my Robbie Fulks CD's."
4,Very Good Album,"The beginning of this album brings to heart real country. Something that has been missing from radio in a while. However, Kenny starts to lean more into the pop side of things with She thinks my tractor's sexy and How forever feels. These are more upbeat type of songs that get you up on your feet and get you dancing. For the real romantics the song You had me from Hello would be a great one to listen to. He got this song from the Jerry McGuire film. There are a lot of great tracks such as Calfornia as well as What I need to do..which talks about Kenny leaving his wife but deciding that he has to come back and work things out. Go out and get this one. Kenny's got it all."
5,It was just what my son wanted.,He uses this for amplify his upright bass. And it works very well.It showed up very quickly. Thank you
1,total ripoff,"This product (it's not a book, not even a pamphlet, just a fold-up card with a lot of empty space) doesn't have the rules of girls' lacrosse, or basic game strategy, or anything else worthwhile for coaching lacrosse. The Amazon description is a fraud. I won't ever trust their blurbs again. You can get a basic rulebook from US Lacrosse with the complete rules. The Baffled Parents book and the Winning Lacrosse books at least have some content. Stay away!"
4,6 inch heart pan great for baking cookies to use as gifts.,"This is not an original idea for me, it is borrowed rather. My culinary class will be using this pan to make chocolate chip coookies to sell to staff on our campus. The proceeds will go back into helping to fund our Culinary endeavors. We baked a cookie in one we had borrowed and it turned out really well. Some of these will be decorated some will not. The customer gets to choose."
3,Fantastic Toy but has 2 major bugs.,"Got this toy for my 4 year old son and right out of the box we loved it, my Son played with it for hours on end and my Wife and Myself actualy found it to be fun for us to play with him and drive the unit also. Now for the bad part, the unit has no OFF switch, it basicaly waits for about 30 seconds of inactivity and switches itself off. The bad news is that when the batteries get low the unit becomes erratic and refuses to shutoff or it will shutoff and turn itself back on randomly. One night at 1 AM I almost had a heart attack when the unit turned on and plunged 6 feet down off the closet shelf! If your willing to change the batteries on a regular basis than this toy will entertain your child for months. BTW Durability and etc has been good so far and the features are very impressive, the sound is very loud but a piece of tape placed over the speaker will cut that down."
5,I learned first year Russian from this book,"Many years ago, I studied Russian with this textbook. It was the funniest and most effective foreign language class I ever took (of the seven languages I know). Although the take on Soviet life is dated, Lipson's linguistic theories completely revolutionized and simplified the notorious idiosyncratic Russian verb system into an easily learned system of rules. The Soviets hated him so much that the final chapter of the course is a scathing article about him in Pravda. Short of teaching foreign languages through pornography, there is no better system of engaging students than through Lipsonian humor. By the way, this is the only course I know of that introduces relative clauses in the first chapter."
2,The Dog Loved Them,"I bought a container of these cookies for my mother-in-law. I figured they would be a healthy snack for her to munch on. She can't eat foods with salt, sugar, animal fat, artificial flavors, colors, or preservatives. The problem is that the carob chips really don't taste like chocolate. She put a plate of Carob Woofers next to the other desserts at our last family reunion, but nobody ate them except her dog. In her opinion, there are other brands of treats available with chocolate chips that taste much better."
5,A dance with Retro-Electronica,"The first listening was so-so. Nevertheless, the more I hear this song, the more I come addicted to it! TO KNOW IT IS TO BUY IT!"
5,A great song that easily gets stuck in your head,"Madonna's ""Beautiful Stranger"" is the best single since the singles on her new album ""Ray of Light!"" This is an awesome, catchy song, it's too bad that the single isn't released in the US"
5,Madonna = The best artist in the world!,"Beautigul Stranger is an extremely perfext song. Madonna again pushed the limits in this 60's tune for the Austin Powers movie. Maddy you are incredible, unresistable and amazing and you definately know it. I will always be a fan of yours! This CD single is beyond anyone's expectations from this so misunderstood performer. Buy it and you'll be amazed by its rhythm and dance vibe. Maddy and William Orbit did, again, a marvellous and excelent job. Keep up the good work M."
3,Generic dance mixes do not top the original,"First of all, let me hust say I do love the original version of this song. But I bought this import for the mixes. Based on the review by Buck0_Mack0, I believed these to be the mixes by VC and Orbit. However they are simply the Calderone Club Mix and the Calderone Radio Mix....just like every other import version has. And while they would sound just fine in a club setting, the mixes are simply generic, slightly altered forms of the original (which is much better.)"
1,Not as good as I have thought before...,"The music and the song are both dull and boring, I have been expecting a much better one. The mixes are also not fresh and well-prepared enough."
4,"A cool,fresh soundtrack with loads of hits!","This is really a prefect soundtrack for the summer and i don't even intend on seeing the film.It's got a variety of styles on it so it can reach many audiences. The opener Madonna's ""Beautiful Stranger"" is a pop classic,although i still recomend buying the single because of the stunning 10 minute dance mix.It's a masterpiece. Next up is The Who(My Generation) before REM's ""Dragging The Line"",not their greatest moment but allright.Lenny Kravitz really rocks on ""American Woman""(brilliant)before Melanie G's disappointing cover version(Word Up). The one minute of Dr Devil(""Just The Two of us"") leads to a brilliant rocking instrumental from Greenday.Next up is ""The Time of The Season"",an average song called ""Buggin'"" and a good song ""alright""(The lucy nation). Elvis Costellos disappoints before we round off with a cute instrumental.4/5 is my mark.Buy it!"
2,Kind of dull.,"Madonna has really lost it. I guess this is supposed to be a pop song, but it doesn't work. Madonna needs to let her hair down and show some real pop energy. With this song, I have officially given up on this singer. Like many stars before her, the best moments are in the past."
1,Horrible!,I hear this song 20 times each day on the radio and i can't stand it anymore! 1 good reason not to see Austin Powers 2YUCK!
5,Manual of Equine Neonatal Medicine,"Practical,easy to use, clear. John Madigan, DVM of UC Davis uses an outline format to provide succinct and clear information about the normal and abnormal foal, risk factors, diseases, diagnostic tests, treatments, prevention, etc. A very handy book for the practicing veterinarian, veterinary student, and anyone wishing to understand the intricacies foaling and neonatal care.Hopefully the new edition will be available in 2006."
3,Very comprehensive and concise,"I had the privilege to learn at UC Davis Veterinary school with Professor Dr. John Madigan. First hand experience with Neonatal Medicine with this wonderful teacher, innovator in foal physiology and medicine. The book is a fantastic resource which I continue to use on a daily basis. Very comprehensive and helpful. Should be in everyone's library if breeding mares and foaling equids.Rule of thumb is if you hesitate with a sick foal you will probably loose him, the more you know the quicker you are on your way to calling the vets."
4,Enjoyed it,"While I did enjoy this book very much, I do agree with other reviews that a bit more development would have made it even better. It was a good read and I would recommend!"
1,terrible idea,"If you want a garunteed way to become trendy then this series is perfect for you. This cd will become the coolest thing in your life until all of a sudden its considered passe. Then you'll have no choice but to buy NOW 25.If you ever look at NOW 1 you'll knotice how passe it has become. In ten years this cd will be just the same. Appreciate music for its own sake, forget about whats NOW."
3,Aceptable,"Es aceptable, aunque no todos los temas son muy buenos. De todos modos, hay que elegir solo lo que a uno le gusta.Roberto"
5,Excellent CD!!!!!,"If you really need to be updated with the recent hits all around the USA, so you MUST buy this CD: it is an excellent compilation of all kinds of genres: rap, r&b, dance, rock and country. I missed only the hit THAT'S WHY I'M HOT by MISM. I hope it will be included on the next CD Now 25..."
4,This is a good compilation,"If you like this music, the cd is great. It works out to be cheaper than buying all these songs separately on itunes, but then again, if you like this music. You probably have a lot of these songs already!"
1,Putrid,"I think this series perpetuates bad music. Observe- If I were in a band, and we somehow got famous, I would be livid if my music somehow wound up on this or on Kidz Bop. Therefore, Musicians (who care about music and fanbase rather than money and sales) are inadvertantly discouraged to make music that sells!Of course, this is not exactly the case, but I would make sure my record contract included a clause to keep me off of these albums, if that's possible"
3,Great for a Juke Box,"I've never been a big fan of mixes that pull their material from such a wide spectrum, and I will never be able to listen to this CD straight through, but I'm buying this and two other NOW discs for our Juke Box at work (a bar downtown Milwaukee, WI).For that use - it works well, as customers come and go through the coarse of the night, the style of music played changes. Bad songs are good for a Juke Box (if someone plays them) as they get people off of their stools to play something they like. When the the bar is filled with people of widely different music preferences the Juke is still playing LONG after I'm done cleaning up for the night - HOURS after the last customer was kicked out...This CD will work well for a Juke Box, but to play straight through at home or in the car it will have limited value - you'll get more milage pulling the songs you like off of it and burning your own mix CD."
3,Not diverse enough,"This series of cds is ok if you tend to lean towards more rap/hip-hop, since there is 30% of it on there the majority of the time now. It used to be a good mix.. of what's ""now"" instead of what's ""now"" in that teen's car that you can here 20 feet away."
5,now that's what i call music! 24,"i also bought this cd along with others and i just loved it. the reason i like this now cd because it has a few of my artists on it. the artists on it are once again BEYONCE,RIHANNA, and DAUGHTRY."
3,Not as good as the other NOW's,"I have been collecting all of the NOW albums the past 8 1/2 years and many of them are really good (my favorites are NOW 5,14,20,and 27). But I didn't hear too many good songs in this one except KT Tunstall's 'Suddenly I See' and the one by Daughtry. Not all the NOW's are that great and this one is just average. I would personally give it 2.5 stars."
4,Big Head Grill Brush,"I received the Grill Brush as a gift. We barbeque 12 months a year - in rain, snow and sunshine. My grill gets a workout. Most brushes I have used have either melted down after prolonged use, or the handles could not withstand the pressure while cleaning. This brush removes the grime and takes a beating. This brush is well worth the investment to have a clean grill each time you begin to cook a masterpiece!"
1,Can't Keep Reading!,I'm sorry to say I just can't get into this book. I try to read at least 100 pages but nothing so far has sparked me to go even that far. It is very slow going and I just can't get interested in any of the characters.
5,A Great Book,"I've had this book of Cunningham's for a number of years and have had very good experiences using it. I think it is one of his best books, and am very pleased to see it in print again. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to work with dreaming. It is a very beautiful and informative book."
5,Excellent book for Western students of zen.,"This book is a milestone in zen literature for the western student. Mr. Sekida was a layman who wrote primarily for the zen student who does not study regularly with a teacher. It is a detailed but practical book. This was one of the first books on zen I ever read, several years ago, and at that time it was probably too detailed for me to appreciate. Now, with the benefit of more experience and a little personal instruction, I can appreciate the book much more, and it serves as a source of both practical and philosophical information and inspiration. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the theory and practice of zen."
3,Picture doesn't match description,"The picture shows an additional compartment for sunglasses, gum, etc but the actual product (and the description) doesn't include it.If you want the additional compartment, Rubberqueen has a ""Cup-n-Stuff"" cup holder. The only problem is that as of 12/13/2007 there is a limited number of colors available for the ""Cup-n-Stuff""."
3,Ending was confusing,"Johns Saul Nathaniel: Let me just say that i bought this book because of all the good reviews......It was a let down. I thought the beginning of the book was good. But the story starts to get confusing when Saul claims that Nathaniel is real and not a paranormal entity like he leads the viewer to believe. He also focused too much on the past of the town and included Nathaniel a little allowing the viewer to feel there was more hidden secrets, when in the end there was nothing but confusion. I reality i think he ""Saul"" for go a bit of writers block and changed the story like 100 times and then just gave up."
4,Very creepy book with an outstanding setting,"characters were great, setting was especially creepy, and the entire book's body was well put together. I've met John Saul once and he seems as mysterious as his books. This is the best book of his to date for me. I haven't read all of his, but quite a few. I also suggest Black Lightning. Not as scary as Nathaniel, but a overall easy story to follow with some scary parts."
5,A Real Page Turner,"This is one of his best works!!!I love this book so much I'm going to have to read it again!! The way John Saul writes you can actually feel like your in the story.I get lost in the books losing track of time.If you like campfire tales,urban legends,or folklore, READ THIS BOOK !!!!!!!!"
2,Well written and gloriously unspectacular.,"I suppose what makes a horror novel successful, above all other criteria, is the degree of suspense felt by the reader; this, of course, varies from person to person. Nathaniel was virtually free of suspense: most of the scenarios that Saul tosses at us are suspense of the cliffhanger variety. That is to say that although there is suspense by virtue of the situation, the reader more or less expects the outcome of each and every situation. This applies to all elements comprising the conclusion as well. It simply isn't a very good book where the story is concerned. But, in order to balance out the review, the writing skill must be mentioned. John Saul can, in short, tell an unenthralling story incredibly well. The details are drawn out to the very last strand of hair, the pace of the story varies incredibly well and, most importantly, Saul keeps a consistent third person tone. Unheard of! If only the story had been better."
5,Spooky,What a spooky book this is! John Saul always comes through when it comes to scaring people to death and his book Nathaniel is no different. I was practically clinching my eyes shut during the barn scenes (I know! Difficult to do while reading--but it's true!) as well as the scenes out in the open prairie fields. Nathaniel is a great fright book for anyone who needs a quick getaway from the everyday blahs. The story flows quickly and is very intriguing and mysterious and the scares are a-plenty! Enjoy Nathaniel all curled up on a sofa at night with a lamp nearby and you might just find yourself jumping at all kinds of unknown noises around your house!
4,Nathaniel,Nathaniel was a good ghost. Just Anne Rice stories. I feel sorry for Anna Hall for going though a tough life. Like God say be good to the poor. Help those needs help. Anna did needed a lot of help. So did Janet. And we need forgiving. Like people like Amos. He was a nightmare. God says forgive everyone. That's way Jesus die on the cross.
5,spooky and haunting!,This is the type of horror story in which you feel the characters pain. You realy get caught up in the story
5,AWESOME!,"Just an incredible book from an Author who never seems to weaken in his story lines.. they keep getting better and better. This is definitely a great book if you like the paranormal, for lack of a better word. Get it! Before Nathaniel gets you"
5,for boys too!,"This is the only tea set i have seen that has a more gender-neutral color/design. Boys like to pretend to make food and drinks too, and the process of making and pouring tea for friends and family is an exercise in doing things in an orderly way and sharing with others. My 3 yr old son, first having a love for yummy herbal hot or iced tea (from his mommy), has been wishing for a tea set and i think he'll love this set."
5,"nice ""real"" tea set.","My 3-year old picked this to buy with a birthday giftcard. She wanted a ""real"" tea set like Frances in the bookA Bargain for Frances (I Can Read Book 2). This was a perfect combination of usable size and low price.Things you want to know:1.) These are REAL ceramic dishes. They will break if you drop them. I was OK with that, as my kids use real dishes and cups for meals and know how to handle them, and it was her own money. But if your children are still using mostly plastic, then you might want to look for something else.2.) I measured the volume of the cups and teapot before I fixed our first batch of tea. The cups each hold 1/3 cup of liquid when quite full. (2.5 fl. oz. is probably safer.) The teapot holds just enough to fill all four cups. The sugar bowl and cream pitcher are very small.3.) Dishwasher safe.4.)They will get very hot in the microwave, so you will need a measuring glass or tea-kettle to heat the water."
2,Pretend play only,"I knew this set wasn't going to be as big as real tea cups, but the picture on the product review page of the little girl playing with it made it look much bigger than it really is. If you were to put actual liquid of any kind in the tea cup(s) it would literally be about as much as 2 thimbles' worth. If you're using this for pretend, it's great. If you want to have a real tea party with other little friends, go a different route because this set is practically doll-sized."
3,TEA SET,"granddaughter loves her set I think its on the small side, it is smaller than her cheap plastic set. But she likes it"
5,Cutest Tea Set!,"This is an adorble tea set (fit for a Queen). It is not little at all, rather quite bigger than the average tea set's I have seen. My 3yr old daughter just loves it!! I still keep around while she play's with them, after all they are ceramic and can brake easily. Kid's her age want the real deal, so that is why I purchased the ceramic, instead of plastic. I will wait until she is a little older for her to play with them alone!! Even with that stated, we have fun playing tea party together, with her dolls and stuffed animals. You can place liquids inside and you do have to hold onto the lid of the tea pot, but that is not a problem at all. We think of it as a more sophisticated way of pouring out the tea anyway!! :)"
2,Grand children Tea Set,"The prooduct was not the quality that it should have been. It appears that it was of ""second"" quality. The writing on the set was in the wrong place and there were imperfections in the cups, plates and etc.Wish we could have found the product locally so we could have checked it out before purchasing."
5,Beautiful Tea Set,"No negatives! highly recommend. Only wish it came with a tray! My 3 yr old and I have had tea every day since Santa Claus left this under the tree :)The colors are super cute and the shapes are adorable, I wish I had one like this when I was a little girl."
5,Excellent Tea Set for my 2 year old,"My daughter and I have so much fun with this tea set. It is very durable, we actually put apple juice in the tea pot and she can pour the ""tea"" into everyone's cup - when we are done - we throw it in the dish washer. She loves it."
3,Breaks Easily,"I bought this set for my daughter for her 4th birthday. Although the age says 8+ I read a lot of reviews that talked about how durable it was, even for 2.5-3 year olds. This has not been our experience. The pieces chip easily, a few have broken and and we have tried to glue them but they tend to break into tiny pieces so it is impossible to get it right again. Instead of being able to play freely my daughter is always worried she is going to break it. As cute as it is, I would not recommend this set for a younger child."
5,tea set,ordered this for my daughter for christmas. it arrived on time and in one piece. i know she's going to love it
2,"Really cute, great colors, but arrived broken","These are just the perfect colors to go with the kitchen set we're making our daughter for Christmas, and from the other reviews, it seemed like they would be pretty sturdy, so I decided to take a chance. Unfortunately, they arrived with one of the saucers in pieces, so I'm returning it for a refund. I can't trust that my little girl wouldn't break one and hurt herself."
1,Where is the quality control?,"I purchased this ceramic tea set for a soon-to-be three year old girl, guided by the glowing reviews. Luckily, my wife wanted to see the set before we mailed it off. Most of the pieces were OK, but one cup's glazing didn't cover the inside bottom, leaving white flakes of who knows what chemical. Another cup had obviously been mishandled before firing, as the outside bottom was extremely rough and sharp. Quality control would have caught and removed these items before packaging. Wake up, America! Chinese products for our children have been proven to be harmful in many cases. They don't care about our children's safety, only your money. I sent the set back, so please don't make the same mistake I did. They may send you the set I returned."
5,Nice set,This is a pretty sturdy tea set. There was a lot of banging of the pieces during what must have been a rough tea party when two little girls were playing alone with it upstairs and no chips. It's also a nice size to get an actual little drink of tea. I had a tea party with my 4 year old and the cups hold enough that you could actually get a couple sips. Tea pot held more than a cup of tea. These also went through the dishwasher just fine.
4,i like it,"My daugther is 4 years old and she loves it, i'm worried about the glass, I made a mistake in ordering this, i was looking for plastic material, just to be safe for her age."
5,Tea Time!,"I am ordering my 3rd set as a gift. Little girls love this set. It's realistic and can really hold liquids for drinking. It's so much cuter than all the plastic sets. Only one piece has been broken and that was when my granddaughter picked up the teapot with wet hands and it slipped out of her grasp. Even then with landing on a stone floor, it only broke into 2 pieces that are easily glued. I highly recommend this set for little girls that like to dress up and have tea."
1,More Fragile than it Looks,"I purchased this for a friend's daughter this Christmas. After less than two weeks a cup, a plate and a lid are already broken. Two of the three broken pieces broke exactly in half, which makes me wonder about the internal strength of the pottery. The child is not rough or careless with her things, and the family does not have tile floors, so while charming, the set has been disappointing. I would not recommend it."
2,two plates came broken,"When i rec'd the package, it was in a box exactly the same size as the box the tea set came in. There was no bubble wrap and no fragile sign on the box. If the seller would send me a yellow and a green plate, it would perfect!"
5,Mama couldn't wait,"I had originally purchased this set for my four-year-old daughter for Christmas (I shop a bit early, obviously), but when I got this I was thrilled. I had to give it to my daughter. Although not really a big ""tea party"" player, she's been playing with it since. She has both mommy and daddy playing tea, and she'll play for long periods by herself. If your child enjoys playing ""tea"", I would highly recommend this purchase."
3,cute but breaks easily,This is a very cute tea set and my 5 year old really likes it. I would like to caution pople with younger children that the pieces are highly breakable. Accidental drop on a hard floor and its in many pieces. I would NOT recommend this for an active child who isn't very careful. My 5 year old absolutly loved this set but it took her about a month to break every piece in the set. I'm off to look for a plastic set for her. Now that said my older daughter got a set like this at 4 and never broke a piece but she was just a more cautious child. Think of the type of child your buying this for and base your choice on how careful they are with their things.
2,Pretend no liquid tea set only,"This tea set is a great value and looks like an old Fiesta Ware tea set. Unfortunately, the lid on the tea pot does not have a catch so you will need to hold it down while pouring or it will fall off. Also, the teapot dribble all over the place while pouring some white grape juice that I had filled for my kids. My little girl was trying to be so careful while pouring tea for her friends and could not understand why all the tea was dribbling down the sides of the teapot and all over the table with each pour. I tried it and could do no better. Nice set if you want to play pretend tea party with no liquids and don't mind the tea pot lid falling off."
3,Small,"My child loves it, but it was much smaller than I had expected after reading other reviews. It is usable and perfect for little hands, just disappointed it was so much smaller than i had expected."
2,Too expensive,"I wanted to buy this toy for my daughters for Christmas, but at almost $70 I was not willing to buy this one. I was very pleased to find the exact set at a local toy store for $10. I am not sure why it would be priced so high on here. It is a great set though."
3,Broken on Delivery,"I think my daughter would have had a lot of fun with this, but is was smashed to pieces on delivery - back to Amazon"
4,this is good,its softens the skin leaves no hair but itches thats the only flaw Satin care is better
1,Boring... dull... not exciting,"The first video in this series was actually good, but it's gone downhill since. It's almost like they used up their best stuff on tape #1, and have been dumping the rejected scenes into these ensuing videos. This one shows no imagination or creativity. It's almost like they assigned a girl-girl production to a guy who doesn't particularly LIKE girl-girl erotica. If that's the case, then why bother?"
3,Good for the inexperienced,"This book has a lot of good information for the less experienced guy. A lot of this stuff has always come naturally to me and I didn't really find much of it useful. However, as a student of great sex I think this is a really good book to read."
3,Avid Reader,"The book was real informative on what to do in the bedroom. I applied a lot of the techniques and they do work. For those that have a hard time visualizing, I think the book would have been better if it had pictures. No pictures didn't bother me, but everyone's different. I just zoomed through the reading. The books still worth getting considering it's wisdom."
2,"Chess is Chess, but make this a last resort","It's hard to screw up a Chess set. I bought the Chess standalone version of this set from the Cardinal ""Classic Games"" line. I am disappointed and wish I could return it.The board is flimsy cardboard that doesn't sit flat on a table top. The pieces are cheap plastic with sharp edges and it's difficult to distinguish Queens from Bishops.The one page instruction manual is nice, but I shiver to imagine a Chess neophyte trying to garner some sense of how to play the game from it.There are better chess sets out there. I will not buy from Cardinal Games as a product line again."
5,Fairy Tale? I think not!!!!!!,"I thought 'Animal Farm' was a wonderful book, but then again I am a freshman in high school. When I read it first in about 4th grade, sure it was a great story but then I couldn't comprehend the malignant truth behind it. And there was still the gory stuff that I could not understand. If you ask me, this is not a Fairy Tale but a Scary tale, and I suggest that it not be read to any unsuspecting child under the age of 12."
3,It's an OK book.,"The book ""Animal Farm,"" had its up and its down, meaning half of it was good and the other half was not so good. The book is about animals who aren't treated right by their owners, and they start to rebel, then the animals have to get along and help each other out to survive. It just makes you want to be kinder to animals if you own them or not. Old Major is one of the characters who wants nothing to do with humans, and doesn't want any of the animals to turn into a human. Later on at the end of the story one of the characters you would least expect gets as close to human as any other animal possible."
4,Its an very good political novel but lacks reader intrest,I feel taht the novel portrays human behaviour and tendencysexytremly well.It has a very acurate conection with real life( the lives of Trosky and Stalin) the the novel is a politicalone. I find that the novel does not keep a reader interestedand I found myself pushing myself to read the rest.
4,Farm animals stage a revolution in this good satire.,"- fast Read, enjoyable, interesting, also good for kids,,,, See Orwell's '1984' for a more serious view. DoublePlusGood"
3,I READ THIS BOOK AND LIKED IT,THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD BOOK. IT WAS ABOUT PIG WHO RUN THE FARMER OFFTHE FARM.I READ IT IN ABOUT A WEEK. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I READ. I WOULD REACOMEND THIS BOOK TO OTHER PEOPLE.
4,"Orwell tells us: ""Worker, beware!""","When I was in school, I became very interested in the ""negative utopia"" stories, like ""1984"" and ""Brave New World"". Like ""1984"", ""Animal Farm"" contains many of the same cynical and merciless attacks on social order and rank established by decree. Strangely enough, when I think of this story today, I think of my workplace, where ""managers"" are accorded special privilege, coddled, and treated with honor (for having to do the all-important ""brain work""), while the legions of laboring ""workers"" simply go home every day saying ""I will work harder"". This, of course, is the precise cynicism that has propelled the comic strip ""Dilbert"" to such fame, since it can be so true. ""Animal Farm"", therefore, was one of my better preparations in school for the reality of the working world, for it told me never to trust the self-proclaimed ""leaders"" much farther than I could throw them."
3,"Nice fairy tale, no message","Enjoyable fairy tale, good for young kids, enjoyable for older ones too, there is no politicial message. True it reflects some asspects of soviet ""communism"", but it gives no reasons for why the pigs became greedy. It just happened, and communism will never be a workable system ""just because"" according to this book"
5,a brief epic,"For those without much time to spare might I suggest Animal Farm, a vicious little satire on the pros and cons of government and society. As always Orwell has a lascerating wit and a smooth narrative pacing that makes everything important and nothing dull. Despite the short length there is a great deal of information imparted in glowing, shivering language, simple and yet dignified; chatty and yet sometimes overwhelmingly lofty. And yet the pace of the story will have you racing through it like a 600 page crime novel where everything just keeps getting uglier. Read it in a day, over a weekend, during quiet time on a several day beach vacation.The metaphors aside, this book relates a profound understanding of the very human motives that make community government always aimed toward personal corruption."
3,A pritty good book.,Animal farm is about an animal farm revolting ageist the human running the farm. Its a metaphoric story of communism in Russia.This book was interesting in the thought of animals playing the parts of humans. It is well written but a little boring at parts. Over all i would rate this 3 stars.
4,I Really Liked It!!,Personally I loved this book. It shows how people get power hungry and make you think they are doing it for you but actually they are doing it for themselves.A great book for adults and teens but you have to understand how parts of our world are run. I couldn't put it down all day! I think Geroge Orwell was a great writer. That is all I have to say for now.
2,Not enough bang for your buck.,"Don't get me wrong, this is a FANTASTIC book. Orwell delivers a spectacular critique of communism. My issue came from the book itself. Though its a ""Centennial Edition"" the extra price you pay for a fancy cover and a new forward is just not worth the few extra dollars I paid. Save your money and try and get a copy of this great book without all the junk."
5,Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.,"Orwell's _Animal Farm_ is brilliant. Its genius works on several levels: it is easy (and dare I say it? fun) to read. It is an accurate commentary on power and is a biting criticism of post-revolutionary Russia.After the animals take over a farm, rules are established to create an egalitarian society. Gradually, the rules are amended, dissent is estinguished, and ultimately, the pigs rule as brutally and ruthlessly as the farmer.Highly recommended."
2,Dont Get the love,"First off, I didnt like this book at all, it was very depressing, very repetitive and told me nothing i didnt already know.I dont Get this book at all, nor do i get why so many love it, its just a depressing tale of corrupt people who get off on power trips while the masses are too dumb to do anything about it. Its insanely depressing, yes, i used that word again because its needed. Its THAT depressing...Maybe im missing something...but i dont see how this book is insightful or anything..Who DOESNT know that some people get off on power?I dunno, im tired, but damn this book was depressing. I dont recommend it at all for anyone who already knows about dictators. Go watch a documentary on north korea and save yourself some time and money."
3,Amazon privacy problem!,I've been an Amazon customer for a long time. The recent news about Amazon Kindle DRM really shocked the hell out of me. More shocking to me was the reaction of Amazon when the issue blew up and caused an outcry. Amazon chose to remain silent about the use of DRM in their products. It would be great if Amazon would publicly declare they will abandon use of DRM..
2,Easy Orwell,"Animal Farm is a cute little book great for combined 6th or 7th grade studies in English and History. It tells the story of the Russian revolution (1917) and its aftermath through George Orwell's Trotskij-stained glasses. The analogies are so easy to notice that I, personally, got tired of reading the book after just a few pages. But the book isn't entirely crappy. It can be used as great entertainment for kids. Because however involuntarily amusing it is in this wrapping, the Russian revolution definitely was action-packed. You can also choose to read the book without considering the historical framework. When that is done the book gains a lot and actually ends up seeming quite cute.George Orwell is a great writer and he surely had great reasons for writing ""Animal Farm"". It can be read as an introduction to some of his other work. But if I was you I would jump right on to 1984."
3,The Saddest Ending I've Read So Far,"Animal Farm is a wonderfully written portrayal of our future as humans, yet I find it sadly lacking. Many of the beliefs the animals share are parallel to my own; I do not agree with the killing of animals for meat, forcing them to produce an absurd amount of milk for human consumption, or placing them in servitude to satisfy our own needs. While I find it gratifying to discover another who agrees with my ideas, the ending was so sad and incomplete I became depressed. Boxer, the hardest working animal on the farm, is slaughtered because he is no longer useful, and the pigs become absolute monarchs of a rule of terror enforced by attack dogs. Then the animals look on while their leaders mingle with humans and can no longer tell who is a pig and who is a human. That is where the story ends, leaving you to guess the outcome while the ""less equal"" animals continue to live in suffering. Not exactly my idea of a bedtime story."
1,the worst book,i love animals and if you like animals this book is not for you. at first i thought it was going to be great but then it turned into a huge discrace. i would not reckomend this book to anyone that doesn't want to be sad or depressedSummer reading class!!!
1,Don't read it,"Perhaps the worst book I have ever layed eyes on. I can't stand this kind of unrealistic plot, (whose ever heard of pigs giving lectures about politics). If I weren't having to read this for English 10 I could be digging into a true classic and my holidays would be much more enjoyable."
4,Great novel about the dangers of Communism.,"With its bizzare illustrations, this version of George Orwell's immortal classic is a true delight and a thought provoker. Animal Farm is one of the greatest George Orwell books, next to 1984, that I have read."
5,Superb political allegory,"I first read this book without really considering its message but I loved it anyway and thought it was a great story. However the lasting impression is its excellent satire of comtemporary society in Russia under Stalin, and this has obviously made it a favourite for American high school indoctrination. It is not really a satire on other Communist societies and Marxist philosophy in general, but more a chilling criticism of the betrayal of idealism in Russia by 1945 with implicit references to Stalinism throughout the book. But whether you appreciate the political side of it or are looking for a great story it is either way an excellent read."
4,Mandatory reading...,"'Animal Farm' is a fairy tale of sorts, a modern allegory on modern happenings, yet told in a fantastic and unbelievable way. No, instead of political commentary or essays, or fiction that is apparent, Orwell chose the realm of fantasy to make his points on Socialism and the human way. Not sword and sorcery fantasy, but rather that classic mode of storytelling that works so well, in which non-humans take up the role as humans, showing us who we are while remaining distant from our image. Facinating through and through.And you get all that in less than 100 pages."
5,Just Awesome!,"Animal Farm turned what was one of the most significant events in this century and put it into a story even a 5th grader could understand while maintaining every bit of historical integrity. Even if you have no interest in the Russian Revolution, you WILL be awed at the simple prose in which Orwell writes to convey one of the most complex problems of our time"
3,interesting but challenging,"Animal Farm was a interesting book, but i believe you must take interest in Orwell's works in order to be able to truly follow the book. It takes place on a farm ran by animals and is based on the Russian Revolution. You must hold an interest in history and historical fiction to enjoy the book. History is an interesting topic to me but i found Orwell's Animal Farm to be somewhat hard to follow. Over all i wold give this book three stars."
5,Required Reading,"Animal Farm is a great read, and should be require for all children in secondary school. When paired with the proper historical lessons (the Russian revolution, purges, and to some extent World War II) it is very entertaining and could serve as a powerful reinforcement."
3,"Average. This book was OK, but I wouldn't read it twice.","This book was quite different fromGeorge Orwell's 1984 (Max Notes), the only other of Orwell's works that I have read. The allusions to communism are obvious and character development was sacrificed in favour of narrative. As a study of historical narrative, this book is important. As an enjoyable book to read, Animal Farm: A Fairy Story falls short of the mark."
4,Russian Revolution,"Some reviewers have missed the point completely. Animal Farm is a re-telling of the Russian revolution (around 1917). Napolean the pig is Stalin, Snowball is probably Trotsky, Boxer probably represents the working class, the farmer represents the Czar system, the greedy outsiders represent capitalism, so on and so forth. If you are interested in history, this is a clever read. The rise of socialism, and the corruption that followed. An interesting way to make a political point, read it."
4,The Best Version of Orwell's Classic,"What do you do with ""Animal Farm""? It's a tad too short to stand on its own, but far too important to only appear as part of an anthology. In its 50th Anniversary Edition, Harcourt Brace comes up with the perfect solution: make it into a children's book. The trade size and large type gives this edition the eerily appropriate look of bedtime story, and the accompanying watercolors by Ralph Steadman (illustrator emeritus of all things swinish) are a perfect touch. The extra material-two prefaces, one a translation back into English from the circa 1947 Ukranian edition-is somewhat superfluous, but doesn't detract from the overall effect. This is the best version of Orwell's classic."
3,This book would be interesting for politians or farmers.,"The book is interesting, especially if you have good background knowledge about the Soviet Union. The book was so interesting until old Major (Marx) died, and unfortunatly he died at the begining of chapter 2. The rest of the chapters were talking about how the smart animals learned from his ideas,and followed him, although they fought with each other and each animal wanted to control the farm by himself. I think old Major is the hero of the story,because he was the one who cared about the animals rights, and then all the other animals followed him."
5,A great book about living in a communist nation.,"This is one of the best books I've ever read. Although it's only 140 or so pages, it tells a great story. I really can see what it's like living in a communist country or farm."
4,A different show of goverment system.,"Animal Farm shows the socialism from a different point of view. Despite your position about capitalism and socialism, you should read this book."
5,A Very Symbolic Classic,"A short novel of only 130 page, Animal Farm is not a difficult book to read. George Orwell was well-known for ANIMAL FARM and 1984. The book is very symbolic. You find the revolution of the animals on Manor Farm is a symbol of the Russian Revolution. The book is an example of an allegory and a satire. The book has memorable characters- Boxer the hard working horse symbolizing the Russian people, Napolean the cruel and manipulating leader symbolizing Stalin, Snowball the ambitious and outspoken pig symbolizing Trotsky, and the idealitic Old Major symbolizing Marx.This book is a classic work of literature and is an excellent short novel to read. George Orwell wrote this novel meticulously and put in it criticism and a great deal of thought. A clever book, and a great read. I strongly reccomend it."
4,"Short, to the point, and hilarious.","I decided to read this book when I found it in a book that lists literature classics. When I told my parents to buy it for me, I was surprised to see how short it was. I finished it in only two days Some argue that the book ends with pessimistic view. I say who cares? George Orwell was writing about how he feels about things in his time and decided to write this book based on that. It talks about how people take advantage of thier power (in this case the pigs). It's a short book that wont leave you unsatisfied and is kind of a moral type story. Now go read the book."
3,lies,"I was told to read this book by family, friends and teachers and I do not regret it.The story is told through animals living on a farm, who come with an ideal to rid of their farmer and work hard for themselves. As the story moves on the reader is introduced to corruption, lies and murder and the downfalls of society. It outlines the idea that peace is hard to come by as there will always be that power hungry somebody ready to ruin it all.It's a fast read (took me about three days) and I really do recommend it. It's heart wrenching and powerful."
5,Ironic,"Those that wish to control society have learned more from such works as ""Animal Farm"" and ""1984"" ""Brave new World"" than the societies that their respective authors wished to protect. Sad and ironic."
3,Good book...,"Good book. I was able to keep attention and even though Im in 11th grade, it still kept me reading and wanting to know more. I liked the ending and I thought it was overall a good book."
5,Strong Commentary on Communism,"Animal Farm is a sly way of teaching kids and adults alike the history of communism and why it cannot work in a world full of free societies.In Orwell's greatest book he successfully chastises communist governments and ideals as he had intended. This book is a good read for all generations and most will find the story entertaining just based on it's face value.History and political buffs will find a bit more enjoyment with the underlying meanings, but I would suggest this to anyone looking for a solid read."
3,Animal farm,"I believe that animal farm was a very intersting book. The whole message of the book was great, it was simple yet very complex . If you dont know all about Russian history it's ok because you dont have to understand all the history to enjoy reading the book. Animal farm is a short get to the point kind of book. The excitment gets you all at once. And when it does you'll uderstand more and more about what the message of the book is. Well at least i did. I like the fact that animal farm doesnt have a solid ending to it. The animals are stuck outside watching the pigs and people play cards. I really have no idea what you get out of that. But all and all the book was good. It kept my attention and i hate reading."
3,Some animals are more equal than others.,"Animal Farm was written as an attack against Soviet-style communism. Once the reader understands that many of the animals are equally as intelligent as most humans, the story opens up to many laughs.This is a must-read, however, take note that it is not at all a desparate cry out for capitalism. Rather, it is a story about controlling the means of production. Throughout, the reader is reminded that the animals were never better off then when the means of production were socially owned and distribution of duty and goods was decided upon ""democratically.""I do not believe that Orwell understood why a socialist state must inevitably fall to dictatorship - had he made that clear, then the story would earn four stars. However, it is quite clear that Orwell is a socialist, scapegoating power-hungry individuals for the failure of Marxism. That is why this book is revered in both leftist and rightest circles. Don't let Orwell pull a fast one on you here..."
2,"A moderately well written book, but needs more action.","I thought Animal Farm was good as books went, but not as good as you hear when asking about it. The characters and plot were well thought out, and were defined mostly by the communist take over of Russia. The representation of major players from the revolution was good for the most part, but was missing some major players. There were however some very memorable moments in this book. One particular one is when the windmill is destroyed. Overall the end result is that it is worth the price to buy this book."
4,well written book,"Animal Farm is a typical book for school. It is well written. I found it is written in an easy language, so it is easy to read. I think it ia a good book for everyone, who likes George Orwell or other books, which were written in the same style."
3,Homework Lisa W.,"On one hand I found the book interesting, because it shows how someone gains power. On the other hand, I didn`t like the book, because it is very detailed, with many unimportant things. This made it boring to read. I think that you should read it, if you are interested in the russian revolution, but if you aren`t, I wouldn`t read it if I was you."
4,Animal Fairy Tale,"I really loved reading this book. I read it in two days, and barely stopped. ""Then why"" I bet your asking ""Dont you give it a 5?"" Well It wasn't realistic. It stretched the truth a lot more than I was hoping. Animals, talking to people? But if you want a fun little fling, this is the book. But George Orwell's writing was pretty good. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong.Jesse A.K.A PageMaste8"
4,Orwell-arific!,"The master of futuristic thinking once again seamlessly weaves the world of farm animals with Communism. If Napolean is really a dolphin, then machine politics is the hoop that he jumps through. I still think it should have been titled ""Farm Animals."""
2,"OK BOOK, Read if bored.",This book wasn't as good as everyone says it was. It is a little messed up because of the pigs and humans...That's my opinion.
2,Hmmmmmmm,This book probably deserved 2 and a half stars but i can't guve it that so. . . This book i sonly good if you need an excuse hate communism.
2,"Pretty awful, not interesting or powerful at all","Some books that are labeled classics shouldn`t be. Such as the terrible ""Lord of The Flies"", and this book ""Animal Farm"". I thought the concept of this novel sounded very unique and original, but it ended up sounding like a children`s novel. The story of animals taking over the human race, talking, working and acting like humans crossed the line betweem ingenius and ridiculous. I see how Orwell tried to express his message across about how human civilization could be taken over, but he didn`t express it very well in this over-rate and downright silly book."
5,This book is the truth.,"I love this book for many reasons. Here are 2. I learned a lesson. And I love the descriptive way that George wrote this book. Humans are the most dangerous animals on this planet. Don't you realise that we need animals to survive?! They are the superior ones, not us. All we are doing is just destroying this planet. The animals are helping us. They are stronger. Long live animals!! We are bad!!!!!!People should realise that the Indians lived without machinery. Why can't we? We Could use computers still, but other things we are capable of selling.(This book is a retelling version of dictatorship and communism.)"
5,MAKES STALIN LOOK LIKE A PIG,"First of all, anyone taking this book beyond its symbolic satirism is totally missing the message in the book. The book should only be difficult to read if you haven't passed the eighth grade: it's pretty short. This book is great in that it breaks the Russian communist system and its history down basically and very accurately. The book also goes to show that communism, though it may look good on paper, can not operate effectively in today's world."
4,Read this book.,"Animal Farm is a book that is well worth reading. The plot of this book seemed simple at first, but it actually showed a great point. It showed that power can corrupt anybody, even an animal. The book began with animals overthrowing the humans that took poor care of them. The animals decided amongst themselves that they were all equal, but that was not how it turned out. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written story."
3,Okay,"It's an okay book, bought it so I could help a friend read it and help to get her ready for a test."
5,Welcome to Animal Farm,"This is a great book. Very short and easy to read but makes you think about the past, present, and future. The US reminds me of an animal farm. They had a revolution, said we are going to be a free nation and not pay taxes. Now it seems we have less freedoms every year and pay more in taxes than when Mr Jones ran the shop. Seems a bit sad and hopeless."
5,"No animal may drink alcohol ""to excess""","A fairy tale or a nightmare? It all began with a dream by Major, a Middle White boar, of equality, and freedom from oppression. Maybe not in our life comrade, but eventually.The dream brings a song. Intolerable conditions lead to revolution. As time passes things change; not exactly as planned.There are two striking parts to this tale that stand out. First when Boxer is sent to the hospital and Benjamin reads the side of the van ""Horse Slaughterer."" Secondly there was a party in the farm house as the pigs were playing cards with the men, two aces of spades showed up. An argument ensues. Then the creatures outside looking in as they ""...looked from pig to man and man to pig, and from pig to man again drew a realization..."""
4,Some books are more equal than others,"I am a George Orwell Fan.Animal Farm: Centennial Editionis a good book. This edition is a little paperback printed on rather low quality paper. Plot and storyline are excellent as well as meaningful. Allegory presents extremely well, using animals of course to convey the events and corruption that infilitrated a well intentioned project ie the revolution."
1,Horrible!!!,The typing in this book was wayyyy to small. You need a magnifying glass to read it! Don't buy it a total waste of money...I wish I would've read the reviews first!!!!
2,somtimes it's hard to follow,"i'm in eighth grade and reading this book. This is a really good book but in my opinion, alot of the time it's hard to follow."
1,Microscopic print!,"The font size used for this book is totally unacceptable. I printed out a sample line of text on my laser printer, and the font size in this book is smaller than Cambria 6. It is at most a 5, if not a 4. It never occurred to me to read user reviews on this book, because reviews generally focus on the content of the book. I know what Animal Farm is about. If I had checked the reviews, though, I would have seen the review by another customer who also rated this at 1 star because of the small print size."
2,Times have changed,"I only bought the book because our book club chose it. I saw the animated film version years ago and as I remember it was very effective. I only read a few pages as I had no real wish to read it knowing what a gloomy tale it told. From the little I read I could tell it has become somewhat dated as communism is no longer the dire threat to western civilisatiion it was when the book came out. Of course, the corruptive influence of power is ever with us as is totalitarianism in various guises around the world. And I do think George Orwell did pigs a disservice; they are fine animals and as far as I know they have shown no signs of wishing to rule the world."
4,hello,hi iyla this is lou i miss you andd this is a weird special message 16 17 18 19 20 blaj blah blah
2,Animal Farm,"This book was rated good. When it arrived it was so marked up, you could barely make out the words. Not only was it highlighted, it was vigorously underlined with pen and individual words were circled. There were copious notes written in the margin. This is a high school summer reading book. There was no way it could be easily read. With that said, the return was more than efficient with my money being returned immediately."
5,Literature as a means of understanding history.......,"I believe that good literature can often provide a deeper understanding of the implications of history and political/philosophical ideas....Animal Farm is an easy to read fable which quickly conveys how the most well intentioned ideas can be turned into a means of social slavery in the hands of the wrong people (as they say,'absolute power corrupts absolutely')who coddle and finally coerce gullible followers.....a lesson on the vital importance of real democracy and the need for literacy at every level of society.So read the book, and save your hide. You'll understand that line....after you read the book!"
5,Totalitarianism Exposed in Orwell's Masterpiece,"This book is not about the failure of the ideals of Communism or Socialism--Orwell was indeed a Socialist. It is about the failure and shortcoming of any totalitarian system imposed upon human beings. A totalitarian system can be imposed by ruthless, selfish rulers regardless of the economic system. To be sure, Animal Farm is about the failures and shortcomings of the USSR, an experiment in state capitalism, monopolistic socialism or whatever you wish to call it. The point is it led to suffering at the hands of its elite, suffering that is unnecessary, brutal and senseless.Orwell's somber humor (""black humor"") is always refreshing. His books remind us that after all, we are all human beings and as such deserve respect. A government that does not honor and respect its own citizens is doomed to failure just like the USSR and Animal Farm."
3,Historical Pigs,"The book is very well describing the problem of a Communist society with all the bad things that happen there. The fact that the whole story is fable gives us the possibility of looking at the happenings in a different way. It is much easier to describe social misunderstandings if you take an exterior position. (humans are looking at animals). This style offers us an objective observation. We enjoyed reading this book because it makes clear the problems of communism in a funny way and it is a good alternative to history lessons. Generally you can say, this fable is something between a history book and a novel."
3,Great but not for everybody,"Animal farm describes the communist system very successfully in a mix of humour and background knowledge. But still or actually because of that Orwell's novel is a book for someone, predominantly for someone who doesn't know anything about communism. Because its aspects can be easily recognized and easily understood. In my opinion, though, it is a pity that the novel offers so little suspense. From a special point on the reader can recognize how the storyline will develop. It can be seen by the story of the pigs, because it is obvious that they transform step by step to human beings. This is a fact that takes much suspense off the novel. In addition the novel is written in an easy style, hence everybody is able to understand its intention. All in all in my opinion Animal Farm is no big challenge, but mostly boring."
5,A book with heart,"Orwell presents his anti-Big Brother, anti-Communist manifesto in this short work and the power grips you from beginning to end. A masterpiece."
3,animal farm like what,I REALL LIKE ANIMAL FARM BECAUSE IT A GOOD BOOK TO READ YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.AND MY FAVORITE IS BOXER BECAUSE HE IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST AND BRAVEST ANIMALS I KNOW WHY THEY KILLED BOXER BECAUSE HE TO SMART NAPOLEON KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T TRICK BOXER BECAUSE NAPOLEON KNEW BOXES WAS GOING TO BEAT HIM UPAND IF YOU LISTEN BOXES KEEP DOING YOUR THAG THANK YOU FOR READING MY LETTER. I'M FROM OAKLAND CA.
4,Animal Farm,"This novel was extremely interesting; the concept of animals overthrowing humans and later mocking them is extraordinary. Also, the relation between the test and historical events adds a lot. This was one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend this book to anyone! The characters are pefect aswell as the storyline."
2,quite interesting,"This book treats a very interesting issue which is, in my opinion, still very current. A revolution with a totalitarian regime following afterwards was and is still very likely to happen today. the book gets partly boring, that is in the middle of it when it is described how things get worse for the andimals but nothing actually happens. I think it is useful and important to read the book, but it is not to be read if you want something enjoyable."
3,Politics in Disguise,"What would seem to be a story of farm life,and a farmer manning his crops and animals,author,George Orwell, will take farming to a whole new level.Farm Animals are used to represent people in the time of the russian revolution. Such as the pig Napoleon, he would be the farms,Josef Stalin.This book is based on trials of Farmer Jones.He's the type of farmer who's irresponsible. He lets his crops die, and starves his animals.Most of this lack of care is due to his alchohol obsession. Little does he know, while he's drinking himself into oblivion, his animals are planning on moving forward to a new life.The animals,led by Napoleon the pig,start living a communist lifestyle. Once the animals realize what Napoleon is doing, they start stashing food such as apples and milk for themselves. This book was a fascinating read, and gives you a really cool look oncommunist countries, yet by an animals view. I would definitely recommend it."
3,Animal Farm,"This book really widened my eyes to the developement of domesticated animals. I began to visualize all of this happening. I thought about the animals revolting against the the humans and them just giving up. My favorite character was Squealer. He was a loud mouthed liar who used wonderful words and got away with it. Overall, I didn't really understand it and I got confused during it a lot."
3,my review,"I thought this book was very interesting. I thought it was cool how the animals formed together to get rid of Mr. Jones.But one of the things I didn't really like about this book was how the animals were able to talk to humans. But, I did like it how the animals never gave up. Even when everyone was against them, when the windmill kept getting destroyed, and when they found out that Snowball was betraying them, they still found a way to pull through together, and not fall apart like you think they would.All in all i thought this book was fairly good, and i would only recommend it to people that are into fiction."
3,Animal rulers,"Animal Farm was a book that inspired me. The book let me see through my eyes that cruelty can punish you. You must treat other well so that you can be treated well. I learned that power currupts people. Ruling over people only makes you powerful, but not friendly.Life can be tough for animals. I learned a lesson. You should treat your animal just like humans."
5,Mano a mano between Orwell and Steadman,"This is the best edition you're ever gonna get of the great Orwell classic. Not only the illustrations are superb, it includes an essay, by Orwell, about the freedom of the press which is truly a masterpiece amid today's abundance of intolerant politically-correct nonsense.And, take my word as a professional cartoonist for 25 years, RALPH STEADMAN IS GOD!!!"
5,Animal Farm goes beyond communism,"Animal Farm is a great book. Many people read it in the context of the Russian Revolution. However, at least for me, its warning goes much farther. It is an unfortunate fact of life that people in power will use their position to usurp more power, and eliminate their colleagues so as to reap the rewards of their efforts. It happens everyday in businesses across America. I suspect this is at the root of why people sometimes ""go postal"""
4,Why Communism/Socialism has not worked ... yet,"This classic fable about the dangers of communism, which I read back in high school, still resonates with me today -- especially in an economy where socialism (in theory) seems like an attractive alternative to the dog-eat-dog world of capitalism. However, the age-old suggestion that ""absolute power corrupts absolutely"" applies even in an alleged egalitarian society, where some form of bureaucracy is needed to ""ensure the fair distribution of resources.""As Napoleon the sheep said, ""All animals are created equal, but some animals are more equal than others."" One of our country's founding fathers also uttered the first phrase, but might as well have made the entire statement. I pray that our human race will someday evolve into an animal that regards the survival of the entire species (and planet) to be more important than individual immortality."
5,I LOVE IT.,Classic! Must read for all ages. George Orwell is simply brilliant and the animals in Animal Farm are hilarious.It's the 2nd time i read this book and i love it.
3,Communism explained with animals,"I liked this book because it was a very interesting book to read. I even learned much about Communism. I find that it's a very good idea to write a book about Communism, in a way that it's not too difficult to understand the important things. It's something special to write a political story with animals. And that's what I liked, because it's very easy to understand. Sometimes, it was very hard to read this book, for example when old major and boxer are killed. But that's how real life is."
5,"Animal Farm, like reading the newspaper...",...today. George Orwell was genius! It's like he could see/predict the future. Love this book a lot. I suggest this book for a great short read.
4,A Must Read,"I had to pick this up since it was such a must-read classic. It really does mirror the government and how it all works, yet is written is such a readable way that it is not as boring as reading just plain plotics. I had that problem with 1984 because it seemed to have more boring politcal parts than anything else. It is a sad journey watching these animals experience freedom than slowly lose it without ever even realizing it as the pigs talk their way into whatever they want. A short read, I was done in about an hour and a half, but it really is vivid and will stick with you forever. Heck, I read what this book was ABOUT a year ago and it stuck with me until I finally picked it up and enjoyed it for myself. While there is no happy ending, it is very real and a harsh reminder of what can happen when you stop thinking for yourself and believe everything you are told."
5,Typical politicians,"This is a great read about why there should not be a career field known as ""politicians.""They ought to be OF the people--simply a person that is not solely a politician."
3,"Interesting, exciting and unpredictable conclusion.","The book I recommend is called "" Animal Farm"", by George Orwell. I recommend this book simply because I am reading it, and I couldn't think of any books I considered good. I rated this book 5. Want to know how animals kick their owner out and kept the farm to themselves? Read this book. I like this book because I like animals. I haven't finished this book, the part I read upto talks about the animals grouped together and kicked out their owner. They worked very hard and made a lot of money. People in the near town who tried to take over the farm from those animals all failed. That's all I know about this book"
5,"No animal may drink alcohol ""to excess""","A fairy tale or a nightmare? It all began with a dream by Major, a Middle White boar, of equality, and freedom from oppression. Maybe not in our life comrade, but eventually.The dream brings a song. Intolerable conditions lead to revolution. As time passes things change; not exactly as planned.There are two striking parts to this tale that stand out. First when Boxer is sent to the hospital and Benjamin reads the side of the van ""Horse Slaughterer."" Secondly there was a party in the farm house as the pigs were playing cards with the men, two aces of spades showed up. An argument ensues. Then a realization was drawn by the creatures outside looking in as they ""...looked from pig to man, and man to pig, and from pig to man again...""1984 Nineteen eighty four"
4,Animal Farm-fable with a sense of reality in it.,"This book, even though the begining isn't that interesting the more you keep on reading the better it gets and in the end it is a really good book. This book has animals for the main character but what it talks about refers to the human race. This book tells us the many characreristics of man;both the good and he bad. Animals in this story show how different people in different 'ranking' of our society is treated and acts differently. Read this book and see what animal represent you the most. It is definitly worth your time. This book is informative yet it has humor and suspense. Some parts makes you laugh or makes you cry and get mad. So just try it out, if you like the book cool, if not hey at least you got a taste of what the Russian Revolution was like!"
4,A Great Book but a Little Hard To Follow,"This is a wonderful book that can be looked at in two ways: allegorical or as a barn-yard story. I, because I was only 13 when I read it, saw it as just a story, yet it still entertained me."
5,good informational book,"when i first heard of this book thought it would very kiddy and kinda stupid, but once i had read two pages of it i knew it was the exact oppisite of what i had thought.the first part set's the mood for the whole story it is basedon the russian revolution. Each character is exactly alike a character in the revolution, for example benjemin the donkey is Joseph Stalin. i strongly encoraged anyone who hasn't read this book to read it and see how dead on correct Mr. orwell was about the revolution. He if you could it this but pridicted the whole revolution exactly how it happend in real life. The scary thing about this is that he predicted the whole thinghow it happended."
4,read it!,"I enjoyed the book a lot. For me it is a brilliant political satire, written in a time when censorship ruled lots of countries. Orwell knew to write the truth about the happenings in Russia in such a hidden way that it is not that easy to see through. But he does not only treat the problems with Russian Communism, the book is a warning of every totalitarian system in the world. It also shows how difficult it is to treat all human beings equal."
4,Animal Farm,"I enjoyed reading Animal Farm very much. I found it amusing how pigs (of all animals) could rise above the rest to become dictators. George Orwell did a fantastic job in linking the pigs to communism. My favorite character in the book was Boxer, the horse. He was such a good guy (horse) that after the glue factory incident I lost all my respect for Napoleon, Squealer and the rest of the christmas hams.Since I finished the book I have not looked at any animal- tame or wild- in the same way. I was supposed to help my grandpa slaughter cows, but I just couldn't after what they did yo me favorite horse, Boxer. I have treated all animals with the utmost respect, with the exception of pigs. I have noticed that the ruthlessness of the pigs in the book, are not far off from reality. The pigs often ram each other created swelling in the belly.All in all, I tip my hat to George Orwell for his excellent job in writing this book for all the world to experience."
2,Animal Farm,"Despite the way it's often talked about, Animal Farm unfortunately does not live up to it's praise. What could have been a very moving story comes off as being dry, flat, and ultimately forgettable. While the message behind the book is a valid one, I found myself feeling like I was reading the Reader's Digest version of the book when I read it. Orwell seems to give a fact-by-fact summary of the book which makes it extremely difficult to feel connected with the story, much less the characters. One really should feel something towards the characters - whether it be admiration or disgust, but I found after reading it I did not feel much of anything towards the lot of them. All in all, it seems that Orwell is simply trying to get his point across rather than actually telling a story. One's better off reading a history book, because that's basically all Animal Farm focuses on - which is unfortunate, because this could have been a really interesting and moving story, and it isn't."
5,Good Price-Shipping Was Slow,My son needed this book for college english class.He has to do a 6-8 page research paper on it.He likes the book so far. Has only read a few chapters.
2,Animal Farm,"This book is a classic so ovbiously it is a good one. The thing is there are a lot of metaphores inside this story. As the story goes on I kind of got confused to what was going on. The animals make some ""Animal Commandments"" which I thought were pretty funny. It is very interesting to me how the animals all of the sudden become smart enough and decide to rebel from the humans. They later realize that it is hard to live without the humans but it is really possible if all of the animals work together.All in All it was an alright book."
2,"Animal Farm-""What a Lousy Book""","This book was about a farm called Animal Farm. The animals can all talk and they don't like to be pushed around by the humans. Because of this they turn on the humans and drive them away from the farm. Then the pigs take charge, and make up rules for the farm. These rules are called the seven commandments. One of them is Four Legs Good, Two Legs Bad. The whole farm follows these rules. The reason I rated this book so poorly was because it was boring. It took me days to finish even though it is a short book. If you like books with very little action but, a good theme then you might like this book. But if not, I don't suggest it."
2,DON''T READ THIS BOOK!,"This was the most wrose book that i have ever read. It was about some aniamls taking over a farm just because they felt miss taking care of. So the ""take over the fram"". And then realy took over. The pigs(that is). So this book was realy boring."
1,None,"Crazy¡! I am 10 and this book was not a gud influence on me. It was boring and ddduuuulll @ the beginning and i almost died. But then when it got exciting i was disturbed because they started killing each other and the pigs turned into people. ithought that this would be a gud ""fairy story"", like the title says. but, like they always say, ""don't judge a book by its cover."" THIS IS NOT A GUD FAIRY STORY!!!!!!!!!!!!! }:("
1,Too Scary - DO NOT READ!,"Seriously, this book is way too scary! I gave it to my 10-year-old to read and he was scared because of all the totalitarianism LOL! DO NOT READ!UPDATE: My 10-year-old was not, in fact, scared by this book. He was provoked by its critique of totalitarianism, however, as evidenced by several subsequent late-night conversations about Orwell's political and humanistic beliefs, and the nature of freedom.I thought my original review's sarcasm was easily detectable, that it would be clear that I meant to say something more along the lines of, ""Every kid read this book because it is an accessible tuning fork by which they can learn about the dangers of totalitarianism."" I figured the ""LOL! DO NOT READ!"" would put a fine enough point on that sarcasm. Reading the comments, I can see I misjudged. Hope this update clears things up."
1,I didnt recieve the item!!!,"I want my money back for this purchase, since you guys decided not to send it to me"
1,DO NOT go to the Animal Farm unless you have no choice!,"Unfortunately, this book was assigned for English class last year and I hated it! Not only did I find this book lame and boring, but I also found it pointless and how they based it on the Russian Revolution by using pigs, horses, cow, or whatever other animals they used. So, if you are reading this book for English class or are about to, good luck!"
4,well written book,"Animal Farm is a typical book for school. It is well written. I found it is written in an easy language, so it is easy to read. I think it is a good book for everyone who likes George Orwell or other books, which were written in the same style."
5,Greed sufficates attempts at equal rights.,"""Animal Farm"" is a book which so eloquently depicts even the greatest intentions being spoiled. In this book pigs have grasped power from the rest of the farm animals and deceived these animals for the pigs' own good. After successfully leading a rebellion against humans the farm seems strong, democratic, equal and moving forward but then a pig with a different agenda on his mind seizes control. I think this book represents everything that can go wrong in a society once based on steadfast morals."
5,One of the best books this century,"In Animal Farm, Orwell illustrates that the ""classless"" ""utopian"" society that marxist communism attempts to setup is unacheivable. It demonstrates human natures want and need of power. Using pigs as the leaders of the communist government that was setup was a nice touch of symbolism. I highly recommend this book."
5,An excellent satire.,I loved this book. The characters were interesting. The story was compelling. This book was overall great.
4,dictatorship,"Excellent book. It reminds me of Planet of the Apes. It talks about social issues. Some of the issues it discusses are respect, freedom and survival. It is a fast read. In the book the animals debate a lot about their living conditions and they take sides(farmer or animals). Like in real life, the farmer has favorites. Definitely worth reading."
4,quite amusing commentary on politics and power and corruption,"This is a quite amusing commentary on politics and power and corruption. Its not a long read and well worth the small effort required. Essentially, the animals on a farm kick out their human overlords and take over the running of the farm themselves. It turns out the pigs are the most intelligent, and end up managing the running of the farm. The corruption and politics of the pigs and the way they take advantage of the other animals becomes more and more extreme.This has some clear parallels with Nineteen Eighty Four too. The pigs rewrite history and convince the others that things happened differently to how they remember, and rewrite their '7 Commandments' subtly in their favour and so on. There's also the enforcement of correct thinking and abuse of power.There is plenty of depth if you want to go into the details of the allegory if you are interested, but the main point is pretty obvious really.[...]"
5,Amazing Book!,"I read this book at the urging of a close friend of mine, and I am so glad that I did. Animal Farm is an amazing, moving, powerful book that simply swept me off my feet. I love it so much, and it has a place on my shelf as one of my favorites."
5,One of my Favorite books of all time!,"This is, by far, one of the best books I have ever read! It's about the Soviet Union, and is a great allegorical, short novel. You should read it if you haven't already :D"
4,Interesting,"I find interesting that this book and other works such as ""1984"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"", are so reflective of today's politics. Could these authors have beenvisionaries of what was coming to us today?"
3,Communism Vs. Animalism,"Animal Farm is a book I'm not used to reading. Especially a book where animals talk and take over human beings. At first it took me a while to imagine this but then I understood it and realized a lot of Russian history is behind this. George Orwell basically pokes fun of the totalitarian government and Marxism. He relates a dictator boar named Napoleon to Stalin in Russian history. The story of Animal Farm goes like this- A farm owner named Mr. Jones always forgets to feed the animals, doesn't take care of the farm and always gets drunk and leaves town, the animals fight back which is the start of a Rebellion. It ends up that Napoleon, a dictator who's a boar, turns out to be exactly like Mr. Jones. Turns out that all animals aren't equal.This is definitely a different book from most others and has a strong theme to it: Revolutions go in vicious circles. I liked it a lot but non-fiction books are more my type of books!"
1,Way too small,"I don't know if there were warnings about this, but if so I missed them (so they were hidden). We were shocked when we opened the package, as the book was tiny. It was about 1/8"" thick in TOTAL, with all the pages inside written in about 2-point font. We just wanted a normal size copy of the book for our son's school project. Instead, he had to suffer through an entire novel's worth of squinting. And, now we don't ""really"" have a copy of this classic. Very surprising and disappointing."
2,Don't read this right after reading Nineteen-Eighty-Four,"I tried to read this after reading 1984 (which I really enjoyed), and found Animal Farm to be really irritating. I guess it's because Orwell is trying to say similar things re:totalitarianism etc., and once you've figured out what he's saying, it's boring trying to get through the actual story. The illustrations in my particular book was annoying too. I think I should try to re-read it next year."
3,The book that finds humor in government,"George Orwell wrote Animal Farm in the early 1940's. The book pokes fun at the political situation of the time. Led by the pigs, the animals of Mr. Jones' farm rebel against all humans and form their own government of ""Animalism"". The pigs use their brains to take advantage of the other animals by making them do all the work. Over the course of time, their government falls apart and things get a little out of hand... Animal Farm is a very well written and enjoyable book if the right person is reading it. I was assigned to read this book for a senior English class and it seemed as though I was the only one in the class who was not interested in it. Personally, I have never enjoyed or even understood politics. I would much rather be reading a more realistic book that I can relate to better. However, if you are interested in politics and government, and think you'd enjoy reading about it in a humorous way, read George Orwell's Animal Farm."
4,Great insight...,"I never read this in high school, so I picked it up recently. It's a very thin book (a little over 100 pages) and a quick read. I found the story to be very insightful - while the story is about farm animals...the behaviors were very analogous to humans. The story begins with a bunch of farm animals plotting the overthrow of a farm. They are able to take the farm over and kick out the farmer and his family. I loved following the progress of the animals - how they work together, their organizational evolution and power struggles. I found myself comparing the story to corporate America. This was a great book!!"
5,Let's just say . . . WONDERFUL . . . GREAT . . . THE BEST,"This was an amazingly good book. the writing is great and understandable, and the story is really good, but the ending is the best.I also like the fact that it was so short. I was so interested after the first 10 pages that I couldn't put it down and I read the whole thing in just one night. I really don't suggest you miss this classic, because it is one of the best books I've read (among Steinbeck, Dumas, and more) READ READ READ!!!"
5,When animals act like humans,This book is excellent characterization of the differences of democracy and capitalism. The animals are used to help us picture humans in different types of societies. A very engrossing book although hard to get into at first.
5,Product & vendor review,The book was in better condition than expected. The seller went above and beyond to accommodate us as well. Great experience!
4,A Prophecy of Workers Rebelling,"Orwell tried to tell us how awful Stalin's Communist government was. He'd been to the Soviet Union, hated it, and tried to warn the world. But no one listened. The characters in this book symbolize members of the Communist Revolution. The symbolism is amazing. In this book, animals rebel against their farmers and take over the farm. But their government of Animalism is slowly destroyed both from outside human attacks and inside quarrels and greed. Snowball, or Leon Trotsky, is better suited to lead the animals. But Napoleon, or Joseph Stalin, forms his own police force and kicks Snowball out. Then as Napoleon gets greedy and uses the farm for his own good, things begin to go bad. Napoleon blames it all on Snowball, the unseen enemy. In reality, Snowball never returns. But he is the unseen scapegoat for the story. If you like this story, I also recommend 1984 and Brave New World."
3,The pigs screwed it all up,"We had to write a report on a book, and the teacher passed out the list. When I went to the library they were all out of ""The Red Pony,"" so I had to read this one, which had the second smallest number of pages. This one seems to got pictures, but the one I got sure didn't. I read Shaq's book and it was a lot bigger than this but this book took a lot longer to read, for sure. My teacher said I did an OK report, but she thought I missed the point about the socialism society and all. But to me it was just about some pigs. Like those Narnia books by CS Lewis, except CS Lewis had that cool monkey in the last book. I skipped to the end, cause I got bored, (it's ok to say that now, cause I already got the B minus,) and plus I had to go to practice. But I liked the donkey and I was sort of cheesed when the horse bought it. Anyhow, the long and short of it is if you get the choice of this book or the red pony, maybe you should pick the red pony because this one is too damn hard."
3,Communism? How about US Corporate Welfare,"NO NO NO! Funny how this book sounds a lot more like a metaphor for our corporate welfare state. The irony of this book is the foolish reader that thinks this book is about ""another"" society where citizens don't have the freedoms that we ""have"" in our society. The pigs in Orwell's novel are the very leaders that are driving the working families of this country into the ground today in the US."
5,Timeless Insights,"I first read this book in high school, and recently read it again at age 35.It was good when I read it in high school, and it is fantastic now that I am older and can really recognize the allegories and metaphors that are hidden throughout. What a classic this is."
4,Chris Warren on-line review,I thought this book was great. In hte story the animals of the Mason Farm rebel against their owner Mr. Mason. The animals make a set of rules so they are to not become like humans. Soon the pigs of the farm begin rising in power and the rules begin changing to the pigs benifit. Then one day the other animals see a pig standing on his hind legs. After that the animals spy on a party the pigs are having with the humans. They then realize that the pigs are taking over the farm and that they are turnig just like humans themselves.
5,A classic tale of Communism,"Orwell's animal farm was written in 1946 and is still in schools today because it's a classic. I loved reading it in school, and I love it still. It's one of those books that you don't forget. It's simple, but good. The simple tale of communism, and takes place on a farm is a captivating story."
3,This book was more relevant in the past then now.,"This book overall was interesting, and I learned a lot from reading it. It tought me about the russian revoultion, but at times was confusing. It seemed to be a history book at times, but also trying to sound like a book only about animals. I think the title was slightly misleading. One of the things that kept me reading this book was how well devolped the characters were. They kept me wondering what was going to happen next."
4,Quick and interesting.,"This is a fantastic allusion for why you should be skeptical, if not mistrusting, of those who claim to act in your best interest and infringe on your freedoms for the sake of a greater freedom. Through almost absurd metaphors Orwell shows how the road to tyranny begins with unbridled trust and unchecked power.There are a number of great quotes and series of events that are memorable and will make you think. It's a very easy read: short and simply written - so regardless of your reading level, you should not have a problem reading this at a manageable pace and following the story line mostly with ease."
5,Very Scary.,"This is one of those books that should be required reading for everyone, followed by deep intellectual conversations on how a system like this could never work. That way, maybe our country wouldn't be headed in this direction. The story centers on a farm that is run by an abusive owner (according to the animals) that only cares about himself. The animals decide that the only course of action is to take the farm over and run it themselves. The remove the farmer and set up a communistic system led by the pigs (because they're the smartest). All the animals are to be given food based on their worth, but since the pigs lead the farm they are given the most and best food and live in the house. Without giving too much away, this story mimics the communist regime of the Soviet Union, Cuba and China."
3,Animal Farm,"My Comment on Animal FarmI think animal farm is a good novel for anyone who is interested in the Russian history. The language is kept simple so its easy to read and to understand. Because of this novel, it is a lot easier to understand what happened during the time of the Russian Revolution. All in all I think that Orwell made a good job of this novel by resetting all that had happened, and transforming it to the animal world."
3,"Good start, but the book is getting boring","First when I started reading animal farm, I enjoyed getting more and more through the story. It was interesting to get to know how the animals plan the rebellion and how the pigs gain power. Furthermore I liked to figure out the parallels to the Russian revolution. The book wants to deliver an important message, but the problem is that the book gets more and more boring. To the end there are no more new ideas. The windmill is builded three times and broke down two times. If the book wouldn't get so boring to the end I could highly recommend it, but if you want to read it completely, you sometimes have trouble to keep your eyes open, nevertheless have a try!"
5,"If you are right wing, prepare for a left turn. . .","This is classic Orwell, and a wonderful read! The story was written about the rise of Communism in Russia, however if you read it there are alot of parallel activities happening in America! Conspiracy theorist I am not, but the signs are there. Let's make sure we don't accidentally have a ""big-brother"" situation in the good ole USofA."
5,ONE OF THE BEST ANIMAL BOOKS I'VE EVER READ!!!,"A bookwhich combines heart breaking events such as the death of Boxer who was loyal to the end, with animal comedy.I loved it and I think you will too. It's an animal classic on my list."
5,Animal Farm,"This book is one of the most enspiring novels I've ever read! This book is a mixture of several concepts.There is freedom, life, stupidity , and betrayal.The book talks about a group of farm animals.There is an old man who tries to take away their rights in the story. The man gets some of the animals to help hem on the deal.But the animals won't let that hapen.There is many dramatic moves in the story.I hope you enjoy the book."
5,Awesome,"This is probably the greatest short story ever written, and is an unmitigated classic of our time. This fable of how dark impulses for power and control makes for an amazing satire of the communist system. It's just a great an easy story that any educated person would enjoy, though one should be warned that it doesn't have a happy ending, whcich makes it all more powerful."
3,Animal Farm,"Animal Farm is an interesting book. You really can't predict the outcome of this story which made me be really attentive.One of the main charcters, Major, made an important speech about how animals were mistreated and fed just enough to keep them alive. He wanted animals to be free. Once he passes away his ideas begin to happen, only not exactly the way he planned.The animals work hard and a certain leader bends all the original ""rules."""
3,I am working on this farm,"I had to read this book in high school. I recently picked up and read it again. I have an appreciated for this now more than ever. I am working on this farm as we speak. However, I am fortune enough to realize it and will be making my departure very soon. It is unfortune but very common that the oppress often become the oppressors... as with the management on my current platform. However, I have learned a great deal. I have also created an understanding that education is the key. Ignorance and fear of the unknown blocks individual true potential. Often it is when it is to late."
5,True to today too!,"I thought this was an excellent story by Orwell. There are many parallels to 1984 in this, and friendly to many age groups. It shows the inherit attraction to corruption of governments, the failure of communism, and how easy people can be manipulated. Highly recommenced."
4,Wonderful!,This was a fun book to read. It gave me a look into how messed up a government can become. That and it was nice and short. Time is a big factor since it's so close to graduation. I'd recomend this book to anyone; it is definately a must read.
3,"Overall, disappointing","I read this book last year as an assignment. When my teacher described the plot, it all seemed quite interesting and clever. But when I read it, I found it to be utterly disappointing. The plot was not carried out well. The characters were made very generic. I would NOT recommend this book."
1,warning,"This review is in reference to the signet paperback version. If you are looking for a great read this is it but I must warn you that this binding is the worst ive ever bought. This is the cheapest little pulp paper book ive ever seen. Signet books should come with a warning label. ""Caution! WAY OVER PRICED!!"" The hard cover is only a couple of dollars more and is way superior."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"This book was kind of boring. It really didn't get into it. I was hoping for a little bit better book. I would maybe recomend this book to someone younger, between the ages of 8 and 12. Maybe someone else can get into this book more but I didn't like it personally."
2,The last part of this book is horrible,"I am not one of those stupid people whose only exuse for not liking a book is that ""it's boring."" Animal Farm is definately NOT boring. It is both interesting and exciting. I loved this book until I reached the last part of this book. I absolutely hated the ending. It ruined a great book. I understand the point of the book, but I still don't like it. I suggest that you read this book, but skip the end."
2,Lousy,"I have been forced to read this book 3 times for various school assignments and although Animal Farm is considered a classic, I find I like it less and less every time I read it. Yes there is deep metaphors and symbolism but the plot and characters are so bizarre that the story is hard to follow or enjoy."
2,Mixed feelings,"After reading Animal Farm I had mixed feelings about the novel I was not sure if I liked it or not. I do believe it is a creative novel the plot and storyline, but I do not find it very appealing. I do not believe many teengers as myself would enjoy reading this novel."
4,Review of Animal Farm!,"I read the book and watch the film of animal farm.In the book I noticed the parallels between book and reality. The history of politics is well shown by pigs and other animals.Especially the russian communism and other dictatorships are referred to Napoleon(the leader of the farm).He reminds me of Hitler who destroy his country(the farm) by his own insanity. Supported by Squealer(Goebbles the minister for propaganda)he takes advantage of the more dump animals(the folk), who work for his luxuary.The industrial revolution is expressed by the windmill, but in the film it moves more and more to the background. The end in the book is open but we all know how it will be....like Benjamin saidnothings gonna change."
5,Red Plague,"This is a great book describing how greedy rulers can pervert a good meaning philosophy. Communism was good on paper but George Orwell told readers that it was actually very different in practice. This also shows readers how when bad times hit a group of people they are easily tricked, and easily become sheeps to a leader. George Orwell warns us not be weak and not to be tricked. Greedy, power hungry rulers exist in every type of government. Don't give them the power. This is a great book, everyone should have this in their library."
4,Animal Fezziey (farm),Animal farm is cool Dog. I like it fo show.My favorate character is Jessie because she off the hook but if she was really off the hook she'd eat them Pigs up son like what!.
4,One of the best book I have read!,"I like the book very much, because it's very interesting. There is a revolution between animals. The pigs are teh better animals. The other animals have to work. The best character is Boxer. Boxer works and works and works. He also works longer than the other animals. I think hi is also a very strong character. This is the reason why I like him. When you will read the book, you will see that it is very interesting."
1,Total Fiction,"Did Al Gore direct this? I was just you know, curious because the animals are talking and stuff and they even have like, this hierarchy of power and things don't make sense like that. This is an anti goverment film but all I hear is Total arin ism which gets to be useful when instilled in the drinking water of places like Africa. Well we gave them animals to eat and they just turned them loose in fields and never fed them and they died. This book is co-written I think by Gore and Moore, but who knows I mean anymore you cannot figure out who is who, but I am Cathy and I escaped from Taurine and this is my review of Animal Farm. Oh, and even if you give a pig pickles it will still attack you if it is hungry!"
1,The only animal is George Orwell!,"Of all the things I have ever read! What a terrible and unrealistic story. I mean, how can animals talk? I have a parrot that talks but not in complete sentences. And besides the pigs run the show in this and if it really happened the cats would run things because everyone knows that cats are born leaders. Anyway, I wouldn't reccomend this book to my worst enemy. I read this book to my nephew, Simon and he started crying and now he is afraid of pigs and horses because he says that they will rise up and establish a totalitarianist state and will rule over us. Ughhhh! It gives me a head ache."
5,A MUST READ!!!!,"Animal Farm by George Orwell, is a classic masterpeice. It was a great book when I read it as a cartoon, it was a great book when I read it as a representation of the key people in Communist Russia, and it was a great book as a short and easily understandable representation of how ""power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutley."" I would suggest this book to anybody looking for an intelligent and interesting book, written by one of the greatest authors of the 20th century. I have read all of George Orwell's books and I thik they are all fantastic, but animal farm takes the cake! All people should be required to read this book, so that we never fall victim to what happened in Communist Russia. READ THIS BOOK!"
3,It is a good book.,"I like the book, but the relation to the Russian Revolution is a bit confusing. Overall, however, it's a pretty well written book."
4,"definately interesting, a different view of dictatorship","I had to read this book for summer reading for school. It was definately an interesting view of dictatorship, and it was a different approach to writing an allegory of the Russian Revolution. It also was funny at times. Orwell did a good job writing this novel."
4,Useful book,This book is often required reading for school (I read it in the 8th grade). The story itself is decent but I like it better as the perfect example of an allegory as opposed to actual reading material.
4,Man? Pig? Difference?,"OMG. I read this a billion years ago but decided to reread it. I had forgotten how strongly I was affected previously and experienced that same result with this reading.I KNOW (of course) that this is fiction. I KNOW that its purpose was propaganda. I KNOW it is an allegory. I KNOW ,OK?Regardless, I am still bowed down with grief, with helplessness, with hopelessness.There are too many Napoleons and too few Boxers in our world and that will never change.Human nature never changes from its piggishness.Sigh.DL"
5,A great book,One of my friend's reccommended this book to me and I loved it! It is a quick read (I was able to read it in a few hours) I would recommend this book to anyone!
4,Misunderstood,"Most people I know that have read this book didn't like it. Personally, I did. I think that, to an extent, most people don't completely understand this book. Of course, I'm not sure I would have either if I hadn't read it with my English class. I learned that it was an allegory (a story within a story). In one sense its about animals on a farm rebelling against thier owner, in another, its about the Russian Revolution. I enjoyed the book quite a bit and would recomend it to people who like to read and/or people who find the Russian Revolution interesting."
5,New life for an old classic,The addition of Ralph Steadman's artwork added a new depth to this classic story. This is a beautifully illustrated edition I would highly recommend for fans of the origianl story as well as those who have never read it before.
3,quite interesting,"This book treats a very interesting issue which is, in my opinion, still very current. It is about a revolution with a totalitarian regime following afterwards. This was and is still very likely to happen today. The book gets partly boring, that is in the middle of it when it is described how things get worse for the animals but nothing actually happens. I think it is useful and important to read the book, but it is not to be read if you want something enjoyable."
1,Kindle Review of Animal Farm Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Page Numbers Source ISBN: 0151002177,"The novel is wonderful. This is nothing against the writer. However, the ebook format aforementioned is terrible. There is no TOC nor way to jump through the novel (from chapter to chapter) except for guessing at page numbers (which is a great change to the kindle). There are no illustrations as advertised on the product description. As a student in college, etexts are helpful and make the book load lighter. But it is problematic for a student not to be able to go through a book quickly or to find a reference.I wish they would improve the formatting of these ebooks or they might lose academic customers."
5,Animal Farm,"George Orwell created a masterpiece with Animal Farm. Telling a tale of a farm that is taken over by animals, he hooks you from the beginning. The symbolism used to compare the farm to communist Russia is obvious. The writing is relatively easy to read, and the story is captivating all the way through. The reader cares about the animals, and wants to follow their story even though the outcome is obvious. It's easy to see why the book has become a classic, and widely revered. Some consider it to be one of the most important books of the last century. Another reason that it is so popular is the length. It is easy to read and understand, but just because it is a short book, that doesn't mean that it is a small story. Orwell makes every character and situation interesting, and the book should be read at least once. It is an overall exciting read, and you won't regret picking it up."
5,It still rings true for our future,"Even though the book parallels the Russian Revolution, the message still compares with our nations today. If you haven't read this book before, this will be an eyeopener. Orwell makes his point and sticks it to you because he uses the animals as an example of what could potentially happen."
4,animals rule!,"if you enjoy this book, you have to read ""Lord of the flies"" It has a very similar lesson to learn.......both books demonstrate what happens with ""freedom"" when no ""real"" laws are put in place.....have fun reading."
5,A Hayakian Fairy Tale,"George Orwell like many in the British Labour movement saw the October Revolution and the USSR as creating a new model society. Others such as playwright George Bernard Shaw saw Mussolini and Hitler in the same light. By the 1930's as Stalin's crimes became ever more prevalent and after the crimes of the Nazis including the holocaust people became ever more critical of socialist dictatorships however social democracy was seen as the way away from another great depression and in Britain the Labour Party was elected to office in 1946. In 1944 FA Hayek published ""The Road to Serfdom"" which demonstrated how the kind of social democracy which denies legal tradition and undermines traditional views of liberty plants the seeds for violent uprising by totalitarian governments. Hayek's book was a major influence on Orwell played an important role in the novels Animal Farm and 1984 that Hayek wrote near the end of his life."
4,For Young and Old,"The novel Animal Farm is a great read because of the history and everything that is behind it. Not unlike most stories there is a deeper meaning behind the surface plot, this novel being an allegory for the Russian Revolution. I personally liked this book because of how the author was able to adapt the story to the level of farm animals. It gives younger readers the opportunity to have an introduction to history so that when they learn the real detains it enables them to compare and contrast. Also for those who know the historical references behind it, it is just a fun way to look at the story."
4,Allegory,"Animal Farm is an allegory of a communist nation. The definition of communism is the government, usually totalitarian that controls the economy. According to the new commandments of the farm, ""ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHER.""(pg 133) The pigs are the government controlled by the leader Napoleon who has more rights than the working class (animals). The pigs are allowed to sleep in beds, while the other animals sleep in the barn. This is similar to the era when the Soviet Union was controlled by the totalitarian leader Stalin. The government was known as communist. But the citizen did not have the same rights as the dictator similar to the government of the Animal Farm. Thus, this book is a representation of the Soviet Union's past."
3,A Student's View (Village Academy),"The greatest part of Animal Farm is the different levels that it can be understood at and the huge amount of symbolism within the book. Although it is written in context of the Russian revolution, the basic motion that the book ran, correspond with most revolutions. I did not enjoy this book as much as Orwell's 1984, due to the simple and less descriptive language. Although it is a fairly interesting book and contains important historical context, it is not one that I would pick up again."
5,Great book! Depressing book!,"You have GOT to read this. It is so sad when Boxer gets done away with, and that last part with the human/pig party is one of the scariest things I've read. When it sank in that the animals traded one master for a worse one, it just about made me cry. This is one of the best books I've ever read."
4,"Short, Meaningful","Author George Orwell abstracts communism into Animal Farm. Animals banded together for absolute freedom and naturally disintegrated for the stupidity of the extreme ideal. Orwell cleverly presents different stages of communism through the ordeals of the Animal Farm. Story is fast moving, clear and satirically funny. Unlike the much darker portrait in Orwell's 1984 (see my review), Animal Farm proves the point and it's much easier to swallow. Very worth the small dollars and time."
3,On Animal Farm,"For anyone reading Orwell or the classic novels, Animal Farm is a must read. While not as complex or intriguing as 1984, Animal Farm nonetheless is worthwhile in its own right. The book is essentially an argument against Totalitarianism or Communism delivered through an allegory of a group of animals on a farm. The dynamic between the animals and the farmer is the medium Orwell uses to make his case. Although it is a relatively simple and short story, it conveys a powerful message. The book was written after ""Homage to Catalonia"", Orwell's autobiographical description of his participation in the Spanish Civil War and indeed takes on new and greater meaning when read after HtoC."
2,keeping the faith,"i think that the animals had great courage to stand up and defend themselves against the mean farmers of England. i am glad that since the 9-11 attack, America has shown just as much courage and resilience"
3,book,"Another book I was forced to read while I was in school . The aspect of Farm animals doing corrupt things (like humans) is just to weird to adjust to. Anyway this book was okay I guess, how the animals segregated themselves and lied and cheated was all about making fun of how humans live. I didn't enjoy this book as much as I was supposed to."
3,What is the Meaning of This?,"I had to read this book for my ninth grade Literature Class. The kids in my group, as well as I, were very confused by all the writings. Though we were told it had meaning that cooresponded to toltarism, we got lost trying to find it. I bought the SparkNotes for Animal Farm from Barnes & Noble, and read them immediatley after the novella. I made so much more sense! Read the book, get confused, read the Sparknotes, and then you'll understand.~LM"
2,"The Book is Clever, but Useless and Stupid","I knew after reading the first chapter of this book, there is no point in this novel, just a good read. If Orwell is trying to make a point that animals should be controlling everything because they provide much of it, he has done a terrible job. The reason that humans control this world is because we are the only life-forms that can communicate universally, which is taken away in this novel. But, after knowing it is a very bad point, the book is very clever with vivid verbs and a great flow. For those who look to find a meaning in every book, don't read this, for those who want a good read and don't care how stupid the plot is, go for it!"
1,The Chain is long and has emerged from history,"Shakespeare wrote. Tolstoy criticized Shakespeare. Orwell criticized Tolstoy. Now it is my responsibility to continue the English-Russian-English-Russian pattern and criticize George Orwell. Although it has earned a reputation of one of our (20eth) century's most accomplished novels, I felt that the ""Animal Farm"" is a consistently overrated work. George Orwell's often cynical tone made me want to defend my own worst enemy - communism. Not only did he exaggerate and misinterprit historical events, which surrounded the Russian Revolution, Orwell forced me to believe that he was indeed unfamiliar with the system, which was ultimately the world's savior from fascism, a regime far more fearful. A series of mocking allegories and failed personification is, in my view, nothing more, than political propaganda of Orwell's era."
4,A classic,"This book is just great! I love how George Orwell ""hides"" messages in his books - and this message was very obvious but yet interesting.Believe it or not, but I got more interested in politics after reading this book though I was still quite young. The Animal Farm handles many important subjects of how our society is maintained and ruled and I think just about anyone interested in politics and/or communism should read this book."
3,Animal Farm,The book Animal Farm was an interseting book.The main point of the story was that the animals took over the farm and then the pigs started to seem more like dictators. I gave the book 3 stars because the main point of the story was elaborated but the details were incomplete. When I first picked up the book I thought it would be boring but I found that I really enjoyed it. I would recommend this book to other people.
4,A good book w/ a strong ending,"when i was assigned this book to read for english class, i thought it would be boring because it was about animals taking over a farm- how realistic could that be???? but as i read on, i was given insight into a world of communism and injustice and i quickly read this book. my favorite part was the last quote, it was amazing. read this book!"
2,Very cheaply made,"I bought this edition because I'm an Orwell nerd and I wanted to read what Christopher Hitchens had to say about the book. I can't think of any other reason to by this particular edition. It is very cheaply made, almost like cardboard. It looks like someone bound it in their basement. I won't read the book, but I bet it would fall apart pretty quickly if I did. I think the publisher was just cashing in on the Hitchens foreword, and didn't worry about quality. Which is fine, but I just thought I'd warn others."
5,The Tyranny of Revolution,"Animal Farm, the story of a noble minded revolution that culminates in the autocracy of pigs is a fable for revolutionary power seizures everywhere. Yes the parallels with Stalin's Soviet Union are obvious: Old Major as Marx, the primer of the revolutionary ideals; the egalitarianism of 'animalism' (communism); Napoleon the brutish Stalin; Snowball the original revolutionary chased into exile (Trotsky). But the book runs deeper than a simple direct fable of the events in Russia from 1917. The English Civil War is also there, especially Cromwell becoming Lord Protector, taking on the trappings of monarchy - trappings even more untrammeled than the monarchs had previously enjoyed.Orwell was a writer deeply preoccupied, and concerned with the exercise of power wherever he went. This delightful novel reads as Orwell's greatest conceit, conceived to show up the constant problems with inequalities and the exercise of power, whatever the form of society or ideology in place."
4,An Aesop's Fable for Tyranny,"While conveying a warm sense of character in the animals, Orwell effectively and succinctly spins a tale of freedom turned tyranny in this inviting book about the abuses of power, and the manipulation of masses through propaganda. More than anything, it shows how segments of populations care not for well-being principles, but for comfort and control through increasingly absolute power. The human ego should be reared carefully, lest it be used for war, violence, and evil."
3,Interesting allegory,"George Orwell creates an interesting story both literally and symbolically. The reading is rather easy, and the story is somewhat short, but it is all-together a nice, compelling story with historical significance."
5,Some fables are more equal than others,"I first read Animal Farm two decades ago, while I was in high school. I'm sure many of you did, too. I reread it recently, and I'm convinced that this is one of those books that one should reread when one is a bit older. Orwell's fable of farm animals' revolution sold out by their pig leaders is simultaneously short, fun, shocking, and engaging. It's also pithy and wonderfully written. Plotwise, you just have to crack a wry smile at the historical parallels that Orwell creates when his characters begin spouting their Marxist philosophies and begin to plot a revolution. Other plot points & themes are timeless -- the supply shortages, summary executions, propaganda, political assassinations, and single-candidate elections in ""Animal Farm"" can be seen in many dictatorships, from Stalin's to Saddam's. Overall, I highly recommend rereading this book, especially if you were a teenager the last time you read it."
5,What can be said that hasn't already?,"Animal Farm is a short, witty, clever satire of the rise of Communism. The book is fun to read and influential; plus Orwell's writing is topnotch, packing meaning into every word. Few people dislike Animal Farm."
4,Animal Farm,This book was a greatly written tale of the possiblity of animals taking over their farm. The treacherous pigs with their obvious use of trickery are able to use the other farm animals to their own advantage. In the story the pigs change the rules of Animal Farm throughout the story and by the end these pigs are no better than their human counterparts.
4,The Ultimate Satire,"Animal Farm is a just a lovely and very easy book to read. One may just think it is a regular fairy tale at first glance but as you think on it, the hidden message, the subtle satire becomes apparent and pronounced. If you wonder ""satire of what"", then I strongly recommend you to read this book and find it out yourself. I admire Orwell`s ingenuity for transforming a fairy tale into a great literary success - that is the ultimate satire.Good job."
4,One of the best classics,"Last year, I had to read Sounder for academic team and hated it. This year I had to read Animal Farm, and I think it was awesome. I'm only twelve, and I got the point of the story right away. It's exciting. Some people think it's funny, because of the talking animal thing, but it's actually kind of disturbing. Still, it's a good book that sends an important message."
2,a total disappointment,"I came to read this book because of many recomendations made by friends and teachers and to my supprise, it was bad. This author went on and on explaining every intimate detail boring me to tears. I don't recommend it at all."
1,Kindle Edition MISLEADING - NO Ralph Steadman Illustrations!!,"One star not due to story - I am a fan of this story and George Orwell.I am also a fan of Ralph Steadman, the illustrator (also famous for his illustrations in Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas, Hunter Thompson)If you are buying this to read Animal Farm, fine (but there are less expensive options in Kindle)DO NOT BUY if you want the Steadman Illustrations - they do not appear in the Kindle version!! I have asked for a refund.."
1,Wow,This book is kinda boaring but it has a good story -Ethan ps:very long:( bedbugs handbags I don't know haha
1,unreadable,This was in really bad shape. It was unreadable in the condition it was in. There were pages missing and some sort of oily mystery stain on it.
4,"Revolution, corruption and lies","1.Animal Farm, a political satire and a good example of Social Darwinism: very close to reality. THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST? 2.Animal Farm is easy to understand and is for all ages. The context to the Russian Revolution is very deep. 3.George Orwell is successful in writing a dramatic and exciting fable."
4,"Pigs may not fly, but they certainly walk, talk, and dictate","An interesting work, widely read in the academic world, ""Animal Farm"" does not often receive as much attention on a voluntary basis. I read this for a course, and I probably would never have picked it up if it had not been required reading. However, I did enjoy it once I got into the story. The extensive and vibrant symbolism is, in my opinion, one of the greatest assets this work has to offer. The academic setting in which I studied this novel helped to unravel much of the mystery surrounding the plot and make the important historical connections between the characters and events. As I have grown older I have come to a new and deeper appreciation of the book and would definitely recommend to classical literature and historical scholars as well as to anyone with a love of literary symbolism."
5,An allegory not to be forgotten,"I loved this book--disturbing while cautionary. The farm animals are now worse off than before their revolt. A good idea gets twisted into something bad--a common theme throughout human history. The conditions that instigated the revolt now appear far better than the thing that the revolt has become. The pigs willfully edit the Seven Commandments to make themselves ""more equal."" (No one outside of the pigs really remembers what the commandments actually were--The Major Pig's visionary precepts are now a farce.) The pigs and neighboring farmers appear indistinguishable as they sup together. Although Orwell aimed this satire against the Communist party, other organizations that start off innocent enough and eventually become twisted and persecutory can take heed of this short novel."
5,"A book for all times, & not only just about communism ...","It is a book that everyone should read ...Trouble is, the title probably makes people think it is only about animals on four legs ...I'm amazed that there are so few reviews about this classic book.In the current financial crisis (circa 2009), the pigs could represent the financial moguls who fundamentally brought about the crisis (in over a century) by having created money out of debt and demanded interest on the money they did not actually own.The other relevant classic by Orwell is 1984 (ISBN: 0141036141)"
2,Beats you over the head with allegory,The amessage is a tired one and the allegory is not very deep. A good read for high schoolers to introduce them to lit criticism but it doesnt hold up compared to more well-written modern classics.
4,Great Allegory with Timeless Message,"Mr. A's seventh-grade class liked Orwell's allegorical representations, as it taught them a lot about Stalin's Russia. They also liked the urgency with which Orwell wrote; he did not have time for character development and background when he had such an important task--showing how power can corrupt, specifically with Stalin. The class was sad to see the fates of some characters, but they understood the symbolism of these ends."
4,Made a great gift!,This book made a great gift for my son...he really enjoyed this classic enhanced with the great illustrations...
5,The Pigs at their Best!,"I was forced to read this book in my 8th grade English class and I hated it. At that young age I just could not grasp the brillance of this book.A few years later since I already had the book (an it was such a short book)I decided to read it again. This time I can say that I was captivated.George Orwell was quite a pessimist, but he had a really great way of getting his point across in his stories.This book is such an insightful look at man's true nature. Watching the farm slowly change throughout the book from a complete hell for the animals to an animal utopia and then back to what it used to be by their own hands (or hooves) gives no hope to what the future of our world can be.The last few lines of Animal Farm made such an impact on me. They really say all that needs to be said in so few words."
5,exciting family game,"I played this game with my family as a child. I played this game with my 5 children, and now play this game with grandchildren who love it as much as I always have."
5,A Great Time for All,"This is a very fun game. It can get quite loud when you play. The object is to collect every card of one kind by blind trading. Everyone is trading at one time so it can be loud. O.K. it WILL be loud. Now every time people come over, they want to play Pit. I wish I got a comission for all the people who went out and bought it after they played at our house. I'm giving some as gifts for Christmas because they are hard to find in the stores."
5,Great party game,"This game gets everyone yelling and laughing. Imagine a table of people yelling at each other trying to trade cards. Every time I introduced this game at a gathering of people, they started out unsure of what they were doing, but soon after they figured out what they had to do, the group would go nuts. Simple game, a ton of fun."
5,Fun for all ages,This game is fun for everyone. It is educational and not too long for the younger set. A nice family game.
4,Be a trader,Pit is a great game for lively play. Work with your fellow traders to corner the commodity market. Not tough to learn. Fast pace.
5,This book was amazing,"This book was one of the best I have ever read. It was a ride on an emotional rollercoaster until the very end. Jim, the teen from a broken home was a lovable and amazingly developed character. He had amazing relationships with his friends and sister. This book made me laugh, cry, and scream. You felt hatred towards his father. Sympathy for his sister, Mandy. Love for Leslie. You want to reach out and touch Jeremy, mend his heart. Cry out to Philly; tell him that he can have a future. And hold Jim. It makes you want to heal the world. It makes you cry for all the people who have to go through what they did. I believe Daniel Grey Marshall is an AWESOME writer, and can not wait until he finishes his second book. I'm telling you . . . this book is worth every page."
5,A Great Achievement,"Still Can't See Nothin' Comin' is a beautiful novel, made all the more so by its honest, utterly believable portraits of the pain and vulnerability of these young men, and of their complex friendship. We watch as they pull each other down but somehow at the same time keep one another alive and sane. It's a book that makes the heart ache and hope and, most of all, truly feel affection for and affinity with the characters. This book is as gritty and beautiful as real life can be. It is also compulsively readable, and I would highly recommend it to anyone."
5,A Wonderful Book,"This novel was the probably the best book I have read. It was written with nothing held back and the climax is so sad, yet ineveitable and somewhat neccessary. Jim, the protagonist goes through so much and as you read about him, you go through it too. I HIGHLY recommend this unforgettable read."
4,Loved It!,"This is some hard core science fiction! The details were extremely technical, but obviously well understood by the author because he did a very good job of making it easy and fun to read. I loved the idea of this world that has evolved in the story and was unable to set it aside until I found out how it all ended. Very well done, and for all science fiction fans, a must read!"
5,Great book,"As a the wife of a man who read this book it revolutionized our sex life after 18 years of marriage. It is the best sex book we ever read (we've read a few beginning as newlyweds). This book helped my husband understand me and helped me to know I was not weird or frigid, just a normal woman - quite different from a man - in what arouses my sexual responsiveness. It dispelled the common myth that the clitoris is the key to female arousal (something I had asked him to quit because I felt he was just trying to flip a switch) and moved him to better things which lead to me feeling truly treasured and vaginal orgasm (a much superior experience). No, this book may not help you if what you need is marriage counseling but if you have a reasonably good marriage but are just not connecting sexually the way you'd like to this may indeed be the answer for you."
4,Good Book,"This book does very well in writing out the basics for men in married relationships. For those seeking even more study in this important area, the dvd ""New Free Sex"" offers a very advanced guide to spiritual sex without offensive nudity or foul language, and the dvd/video ""New Sex Now"" is great for those less shy. All these three are very worthwhile and important tools for happy and healthy marriages."
2,Do Men Understand What Is Meaningful To A Woman?,"Two experienced sex therapists elaborate on how to make a relationship fun and meaningful without feeling guilty. I hoped that ""The Married Guy's Guide to Great Sex"" would tell me what I really want to know, but I'm not sure if I understood everything they were talking about. I can't recommend this book to men who want to discover what brings pleasure and intimacy to a relationship if they need a marriage councellor."
1,Before I Buy...,"Before I buy a book in a book store, I always look at the front and back covers, the front & back flaps, the Index, and an example or more written within without reading the whole book.I noticed on another book offered on this web site, SHE COMES FIRST, all of these portions of the book is offered, which gives me a better idea of whether or not I want to purchase it.This book, THE MARRIED GUY""S GUIDE TO GREAT SEX, has none of those features.I'm supposing the authors (or publishers?) have a certain amount of control over what is presented for the buying public. I'd suggest those in control provide these selling points in their review.I'm not putting any money on this book when I'm not sure of its contents!"
4,"""Exposed"" HDCD Remastered","I really bought this to complete my collection of Oldfield CDs, rather than as some sort of must have. I had the vinyl LP years and years ago but it was never one of my favorites.This remastered HDCD is well put together and the recording has been brought up to modern day standards. I was pleasantly surprised and I play it more often than I thought I would. I prefer the original studio versions of the songs, but that is just my preference.If you have an Oldfield collection that needs filling, and/or like live recordings, and/or have the original LP or CD, then this would be a worthwhile CD to have."
1,Price inflated,"I purchased two items at $4.99 each. When I received them, they were marked with store stickers at $1.98 each."
1,HORRIBLE LIVE RECORDING,"This CD only served to show the fans that Triumph can't duplicate live what they do in studio. IT's a shame, because song selection is good."
4,The model of how to put on a live rock/roll show.,"Simply put: This is what concerts were invented for. Not just to see your favorite band, but to hear them play the songs in a pure, altered manner. Some songs are standards, and played straight, but there is a raw energy perfectly recorded (check out the crispest-sounding jet blast drum solo). Rik Emmet leaves a picturesque wake as he sails through ""Hold On"" acoustically alone, and leaves you breathless after a scorching 10 minute solo during ""Rock and Roll Machine."" Also included are two interesting studio tracks that probably only received airtime in Canada."
1,A complete flaw by Triumph,"Although this one have some of Triumph's greatest songs, it seems to be clearly overdubbed in studios. The drums sound doesn't like as Gil Moore at all, it is muffled, strange. The rest is strange because it doesn't show the emotion contained in Triumph studio albuns. Even f you're reaLLY a Triumph fan, you can pass without this one."
5,Love it,I love this product so much I bought 1 for all my friends. I plan on buying 1 for my sister also.
4,Great frame and easy to make!,I bought this frame as a gift for Mother's Day for my mom and mother-in-law. They were great! The frame was made well and it was easy to assemble. The clay was super easy to use and easy to re-do (which I had to do twice since baby was a little squirmy). They turned out so nice! I just wish the little sticky thing to mount it to the frame was a little stronger.
3,Didn't Work For Us,The first one we bought was great and I love seeing my son's little foot and his picture. When our second was born we bought another one. It never worked and we had to just throw it away (the molding stuff was like soup and never got hard or set). It was a big waste of money!
1,molding clay is a joke,I purchased this as a cute fathers day gift and after following the instructions I discovered that the clay sticks to everything even my baby's foot. The impressions never turned out. Needless to say it is being returned.
2,Baby print not possible,We love the frame...a perfect match to the one we bought 3 years ago. However the molding clay included to be used to make the baby's foot print was hard (not pliable)and it did not keep the imprint of the foot. We ended up having to find and use other clay. This was very disappointing.
4,Great Grandparent Gift,"We ordered three: one for each set of grandparents and one for ourselves. They are sooo cute. The only problem is that the adhesive for the footprint fails and the footprint falls. It happened on all three! The problem is easily solved with a little superglue, and it still makes a great gift."
3,"good frame, bad clay.",love the picture frame and the idea of a clay footprint/handprint keepsake. however the clay was old or something. followed instructions exactly and would not get even close to how it was supposed to be. i ended up using paint for the footprint/handprint instead and framing that.
2,Poor quality clay,The product looks nice and makes a nice present for grandparents. We had a heck of a time getting the clay to roll out evenly. The included rolling pin is a joke. The clay sticks to it so badly we just used our hands. We ordered a different one for ourselves that has a side each for the hand and foot separately. The clay in that set is vastly superior. The difficulty in using the clay would deter me from buying this or recommending it to others. Keep looking. It was really frustrating to use.
1,Terrible packaging and damaged products received; no reply though email was sent.,"Item arrived in a super, over-sized box with no cushioning at all. Item has terrible ""bruises"" when received with chipped corners and damaged paint. It's now still sitting in some corner of my house unused and about to be dumped as I wouldn't put up such a damaged item up for display (I mean, would you?). Furthermore, it's in white, making all the damages all the more obvious. Utterly disappointing experience!"
3,Weak impression,"Maybe my impression mix was old, but it was fairly difficult to work with. First, it stuck to the foil packaging it came in. Then it stuck to the rolling pin they included (I ended up sandwiching the material between two sheets of wax paper to roll it out.). Then it was quite stiff and I really had to apply a lot of pressure on my baby's foot to make a good outline - but, of course, it stuck to his foot, too.On the plus side, clean up was simple and I did like being able to re-work the material. I just never got a good print. Now I am going to an art store to try and find something else to use."
3,Does not harden much,"Two problems with this babyprint product;1) Takes a very long time to harden. Even though the instructions suggest that 24 hours should be sufficient it is not. We left it to harden for a week and it is still a bit soft.2) The baby foot print is not very visible. We needed to ""enhance"" the print with our fingers to make it deeper and create a more visible contrast."
4,Great Product!,"This products looks super nice when finished.... the ONLY thing I did not like is that my son's impression did not come out quite as nice as I might have hoped. He is just too wiggly and I did not have time to redo over and over.Don't get me wrong, the impression putty worked, it just did not look as nice as it probably could have had I redone it several times."
1,Got damaged clay and customer service was disappointing,"Since I read good reviews here, I bought 3 frames for myself and 2 sets for the grandparents. When my baby was one month old I wanted to celebrate it by making the foot print. I opened all 3 clays and they were hard as rock. I was really disappointed and sad that I could not make them at that special date. Contacted customer service by email (which I got from Amazon reviews) and they said they were sending me a replacement. A month later, nothing. I contacted them twice again and no response! They could at least tell me they could not help, so I would not wait until my baby is so much older! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY, go to an arts shop and get your own old clay, at least you know it is going to work when you want it."
5,Nice and snuggly,"These layette gowns were just such a perfect gift for a newborn. Elastic at the bottom allows for easy diaper change, but length keeps baby warm and snuggly. Great quality and oh so sweet."
2,So very very French ...,The modern parisian couple Alain and Chantal certainly do keep themselves busy diddling anything and everything that comes (forgive the pun) into their house...As a married couple sleep in seperate bedrooms connected by a shared bathroom making the furtive sex quick and tittilating ....Except for Alains introduction to the maid of her extended household duties the rest of the book is mundane ...Its a one read and then collect dust type of book very monodimensional ...
5,"Educational, fun and easy to read.","Na Ki`i Pohaku is the result of detailed research of the history and significance of Hawaiian petroglyphs dating from the time of the first arrival of the Polynesian people in Hawai`i. It explains the only ""written"" recording of Hawaiian history in a clear and concise format. Profusely illustrated with examples of Hawaiian petroglyphs from all the islands in the Hawaiian archipelago and dispels many misconceptions about the petroglyphs, and why and where they were etched in stone. Highly recommended."
4,What you expect,"This is what you expect from a pull up bar. There are 2 mounting circles that you put 3 screws into. The mounting circles are about 2-3 inches in diameter, so you need a good bit of space to mount it, but once it is up it is great. The hand grips slid sometimes, but for the price, I didn't expect it to be perfect."
3,It did its job but...,"Is easily loosened up. It also leaves fairly bas scuff marks. I'm keeping mine, this is just a heads up."
3,valeo chin-up bar review,"it's satisfactory. i'd like that the bar remain stationary during use, but i make i work."
4,Why the off center hand grips?,"Pretty cool. My 11 year old has it in his bedroom door. Takes my weight with no apparent problems too.Only beef - what's with the off center hand grips? You're always positioned jammed up against one of the door jambs, which makes it hard to exercise comfortably."
3,It'll work but the screws included are trash,"I just finished installing this bar. Since it seems to fulfill its basic function, this is more of a warning to ""buy it, but"" rather than a ""don't buy it.""I recommend to anyone who buys this bar that they not use the screws included with it to install the mounting brackets. I was being pretty careful but still managed to strip two of the screws and twist the heads off of two others. They're very cheaply made.You'd figure Valeo would spend the extra 40 cents per unit and give you quality screws, huh? Well, not if they'd have to pass those 40 cents on to cheapskates like me who buy the cheapest thing they can find."
3,Good for the price,"I'll agree with the other reviewers that this thing is sturdy. I weigh 220 and it holds me with ease. I'll also agree that the placing of the hand grips is bad. The bar extends in one direction, so you end up with a hand grip that is butted right up against the door frame. Yes, you can move the grips. But, 1.) it's a pain, and 2.) your grip will become uneven because the extension pole is smaller in diameter than the stationary pole.But, for the $$$, it works fine for me. I am planning on putting up a more permanent pullup bar (joist mounted) in my basement, so I won't have to deal with the grip thing much longer."
2,"OK, But Bar Turns During Use","This bar would be great if not for one serious design issue: It turns when you're using it. It installs by screwing/unscrewing the outer and inner bar sections, with the idea being, I suppose, that once it's snugly in the door frame it won't turn any more. it will continue turning no matter what, and in fact if you keep unscrewing it (making the bar wider) the sides of the doorframe can be literally be pried apart! Even if the frame doesn't budge, the bar will still rotate because the round ends fit into round support caps, which allow the bar to turn freely with any amount of force. There's no way to lock the bar from turning, regardless of which way you hold it during exercise. It's always either tightening, loosening, or turning in place. Despite otherwise solid construction and comfortable grip, I can only give it 2 stars."
5,Must buy,"My first born had colic, and while this didn't quite him all the time, it did give my husband and I tools to try. Made us feel more in control. I think every parent should have this!!!!!"
3,I was expecting more info,"The dvd had some good info, but I was expecting much more. It offers some good soothing techniques but I though it would go more into how to get the baby in a schedule or sleep through the night."
4,another tool,"We bought this when my son was 8 weeks old with colic. It may have been more helpful earlier on, however. The techniques work best for young infants less than 12 weeks it would seem. We found the detailed swaddling section helpful as well as the 3 bonus soundtracks for calming a baby. The 5 S's make sense but our baby needed all 5 almost all the time and the jiggling/swinging was difficult to implement. Sometimes he just seemed to cry harder. We were so hopeful after watching the DVD but it was not a fix-all. It did give us another tool to implement and anything was a blessing at that time."
5,Making the first few months a little easier,"We buy this as a baby shower gift for friends every time. It worked wonders. At last we had a peaceful car ride (our son would scream in the car seat anytime we went somewhere). Oh beloved static!These techniques work if only people give them a chance. Too many parents say their kid hates to be swaddled. Well, they were more squished than that for nine months. These techniques make sense too.I hear the book is great too but I think the DVD must be better, especially for those who don't have time to read the book. Watching Dr. Karp use these techniques with real babies is amazing. And the sounds included on the DVD are handy too."
4,Helpful dvd!,I ordered this cd when it was 2am and I could not get baby to sleep. Was so glad I ordered it! Tried the technique immediately and it worked like a charm! Thank you Dr. Karp!
5,MUST HAVE FOR PARENTS!!!,"Buy this DVD for yourself and anyone else you know who has a baby or is pregnant!! Dr. Karp is amazing! I went from feeling like an overwhelmed, unprepared new mom to a mom who could handle having a newborn. It was a wonderful feeling to actually have a way to quiet my baby.My husband and I started this when our baby was about 5 weeks and it was a miracle!! He actually went down for naps and nighttime sleep with minimal frustration. This is seriously a lifesaving DVD. I have made this my gift for all baby showers. I give a copy of ""Happiest Baby"", The First Years swaddling blankets and a pack of Soothies pacifiers....the best sleep kit ever!!"
5,A Great Book,"As a first time mom I tried to read everything I could about newborns. This book was given to me as a gift, and it could possibly be the best gift I received. My baby was not colicky but did have trouble sleeping through the night and calming down from crying fits. The 5 S solutions were invaluable. He loves to be swaddled, but at 4 1/2 months and 17 lbs he has become to large to even fit in the ""swaddle me"" wraps. Making the shushing sound when he cries still works and he seems to forget why he was even crying in the first place. A great book when you don't know how to calm your fussy baby and just want a few hours of sleep!"
5,very effective method,This baby calming method is very effective. I work in post partum and we have this video available for new families to watch and I use the techniques with babies in the nursery. So I buy this video or the book for all my friends that have babies. Best gift ever.
3,Bought as a gift. The people who recommended it (ones with a baby) said it really really works...but I've not personally tried,"I've heard its great but don't really know if it works as the woman I gave it to said she never watched the video.Wish I could give more response. The folks who told me about it swear by it, however."
2,Didn't get anything out of this,"I am sure this technique works on brand new babies. But, I need help with a 5 month yr old who hasn't been swaddled in months. I also don't feel comfortable shaking my baby.This movie was not useful to me at all."
3,good but needed more,the techniques in this dvd are great and do work. however just about any baby class you take or book you read these days mentions these techniques already. again the dvd was good and helpful but left us wanting more tips and tricks.
3,"Good, but video not necessary.","Everything I learned on this video was easily accessible by doing a google search online. For those who are visual learners, this might be for you. We only use the swaddling technique for our son, as he loves to throw his arms and legs around. Not really worth the money in my opinion. Useful for the very early days, probably up to two months."
3,Lots of filler,"The techniques do work but they're not exactly new. I was doing most of them already anyway, just from having picked them up from being around other parents. The material you really need could be covered in less than 5 minutes; the rest of the DVD is just filler."
5,the happiest baby on the block - dvd,"I purchased this dvd for my daughter and her husband (first baby), I only wish I had ordered it before the baby was born. They could not believe how the method worked, even on a 14 lb baby that had not been swaddled for a couple of weeks. It will also build up those arm muscles in a hurry. haha"
4,great dvd,"This DVD was a blessing to us. It really helps out in those first couple weeks where the baby just wants to eat, sleep, and cry."
2,Swing addict!!,"I bought this DVD and some of the advice was great as in to swaddle our son and the shhhhhhhh also helped a lot, the only thing I disliked was the fact that he finds nothing wrong in getting a baby use to being jiggled to sleep, my son loved it until we would be out and he wanted to be jiggled by me or the swing I just did not want my son to rely on being jiggled to fall asleep so I used the Baby Whisperer techique and from 6weeks on my son has been able to fall asleep on his own in under 1min!! I have a wind down routine then lay him down drowsy and he sleeps extremly well!!"
2,Not so helpful,"I bought this in hopes it would do what it promises.Not the case. I do see where harvey is trying to get the focus linked between a parent and the baby.Truth is - it hasn't worked yet, and the product that has a guarantee should really give instructions that cater to all types of babies, and alternate instructions if something particular isn't working.Not what i expected"
2,waste of money if you have common sense,"This DVD is such a waste. All of the recommendations work, but theyre common sense. Babies respond to closeness, comfort, and love- wow."
2,Vidoe quality is bad. The advice is not working.,"The video quality is so bad. The picture keeps on turning bright and dark. Totally annoying. For the advice given in the video, don't know about other people, it just doesn't work for my baby."
2,Lame,Lame! This book may be ok for a 'normal' baby...but if you have a baby who actually has medical problems this won't work! I didn't like that it made it sound like all babies should be 'fixed' by these solutions or refer you to your physician if the problem continues. My baby has reflux so these tecniques only made him angrier and made me feel like a failure as a new parent for not being able to calm my baby.
1,what the heck is this guy teaching,"i must say i don't know much about babies being an adult physician but the methods this guy is preaching appear pretty scary. he rocks the baby back and forth pretty vigorously, yells in their ears---not sure if anyone's done any long term studies to see if these methods are really safe. even if in his hands they are okay, in hands of layman these methods could potentially harm the baby."
4,So helpful!,"This was very helpful! Not all tips will work, but some combination will. While it did not help her sleep longer at night, it did help calm her down....and that makes it completely worth it!"
4,Will try some of his techniques once our baby is born!,I had the book in my amazon cart to possibly buy and a week later my husband and I were in our birthing class and this book & the Doctor's techniques were brought up in class. The Nurse running the class suggested getting the video version so we could watch together. Will try some of these once our little girl arrives.I did like the Doctor's explanation of the 4th trimester. I thought it made a lot of sense.
3,"Helpfull, but basic info","Yes the tape was helpful, but I would have liked to see more details. Keep in mind the techniques will not work on every baby."
3,Okay,I bought this before our infant was born. We studied it and tried all the techniques when she was born. The swaddling worked a bit and the rocking but the rest didn't really work for her. It probably works for some babies but not for all. And I would assume you really do need to start it as soon as you bring them home.
2,Not pleased,"First, I acciently bought the DVD instead of the book, but every single baby book I've read has the same information. The 5 S's of how to calm a baby. It's not a secret. The audio and picture is terrible. What a waste of money."
3,"Good info, but too repetitive","I received this book as a shower gift, and had heard about it from other mothers before reading it.The book contains good information, but really could have been a pamphlet for all the repetitive recycling of the same information, page after page.It was easy to read in one evening because I could skip over line after line, having already read it pages earlier."
5,life saver,"the techniques here are really helpful and we would not have slept well in the early weeks of our daughter. it really works. it takes time to practice it with your baby, when you get it right tho, it makes a whole lot of difference."
5,A must have for new parents!,"We used this video for our first child and SWEAR by it! Since then we have loaned it to every couple we know to be expecting a child and they all tell us they swear by it too. The concept sounds too good to be true, but if you want some peace and quite with a newborn in the house, you'll not be disappointed with these techniques. It is now my staple baby shower gift!!I also highly recommend reading the book as it explains in more detail the premise behind the theory."
3,Same as Book,"I purchased this video but it had the same advice as his book. It was nice to watch how things are done but if you've been a follower of Karp you know how it works. I love Karp I just did not think it is necessary to purchase video and book. WIth that said, I have been using the Karp method from the minute we were in the recovery room at the hospital and our daughter has been sleeping through the night since 7 weeks old. He is amazing!"
5,Paid for itself every day,"My wife saw this on either Dr Phil or Oprah, so we bought it along with everything else required for a first child. She and I were skeptical about it, and my mother flatly called it ""BS.""We were truly impressed. Maybe we were just lucky, with one child we have little basis for comparison; but this DVD paid for itself every day. It felt great to be able to comfort our little bundle, and it gave us time to adjust to being new parents. We now buy it frequently as a shower gift for close friends and have received feedback similar to our experience.We did not buy the book, nor have we tried his toddler video. Based on our opinion of the baby video, we will be buying the toddler video soon.In the Special Features section, there are a few ""womb-mixes"" that play on loop. Those sounds, combined with a swing, brought hours of comfort and sleep to my little family."
5,A MUST have for newborns' parents,"This DVD saved our sanity! When our daughter was 3 days home from the hospital, we watched this DVD and it was like a magician had come in and performed some sort of spell!The five 'S's were so helpful for us, and having the DVD to demonstrate the various methods really gave us a good model. The Q&A; on the extras is interesting to watch, because they get into more specific issues parents might be having.Before watching this DVD, we thought we were swaddling, but we realized our swaddle was too loose. We thought we were swinging, but we were using the lowest speed, which wasn't as soothing. Doing those two things correctly was such a critical step for us! Our baby was so much happier and calmer when we did it right!I had seen Dr. Karp on Oprah several years ago and made a notecard of the five 'S's. I wouldn't have had a very good idea of exactly what to do if it weren't for the DVD. We now give this DVD as a gift to any of our friends/family who are pregnant!"
5,A must have for all new parents!,"I highly recommend this DVD--it truly made a huge difference for us! My only regret is that I did not learn about Dr. Karp until Kalan was 6 weeks old, and by that point I had already been through the most difficult stage. All new parents should watch this DVD BEFORE their baby comes along. I liked the DVD because it was so much easier to put the concepts into practice after seeing them demonstrated. Reading about it is one thing--for us seeing it on the DVD was even better. I plan to purchase the Happiest Toddler on DVD now too, and I have already purchased the Soothing Sounds CD. You cannot go wrong with the 5S's as illustrated on this must-have DVD. I truly believe in the power of swaddling!"
5,It works!,We have a 6 week old and we started using these techniques in the hospital when he was born. They work!!!As he aged a few weeks he starting moving his arms around more and more and sleeping sometimes with his arms over his head so we stopped swaddling but then realized that it was important to continue swaddling to help him sleep more contently.He sometimes cried when we were wrapping him in the blanket but once he was swaddled and the other S's were incorporated he was VERY calm and happy. (Stretchy blankets work best!)My family feels this DVD and these techniques were an important part of our parenting successes.
4,"A ""Must View"" for New Parents","I show the ""Five Ss"" segment in my Newborn Care classes that I teach. They aren't brand-new concepts, parents have been doing them for ages to calm their babies, but Dr. Karp puts them together in an easy-to-remember-when-sleep-deprived package. Very helpful for anyone who will be caring for the baby."
5,I would give this ten stars if I could!! A must for parents!,"WOW. I have a one month old who has colic, and life has been rough so far. I popped in this DVD last night, and while watching, I applied the techniques shown on the video. Within 5 minutes, my son was quiet and content and within 10 minutes, he was sound asleep. My husband was amazed! Everytime he woke during the night, I would feed, change, and use the techniques with the same success. Excellent product - I will be giving this as a baby shower gift from now on."
2,not worth all the hype,"everyone told me i needed to get this dvd it works wonders, but when my husband and i watched it, we were pretty disapointed. everything on the dvd we had alread been doing with our child, kinda like instinct i guess. also the extra sounds on there, were not really impressive. maybe the cd would of been etter to buy, because i think there are more and you cant really have your dvd player going all night. the lady in the babystore roped me into spending the extra money. not worth it. the best investment for white moise is the Sleep Sheep. I love that thing, my husband and I fall asleep to it as well, since baby sleeps in our room."
2,Use common sense and you don't need to waste money on this,"I thought there would be all kinds of tips I would get from this. But there were exactly 5 tips. All it teaches you is how to swaddle your baby in a blanket (which they show that to you in the hospital after you deliver your baby), how to rock your baby back in forth in your arms or in a swing, how to put a pacifier in your baby's mouth (this one made me laugh), how to Shusssh loudly in your babys ear so he will stop crying...that deffinately does not work, and to turn your baby on his side. Just keep your money and buy your new baby a nice swing or toy...your better off."
1,Unless You Swaddle...,"This book is ALL about swaddling. My baby hated being swaddle, even in the hospital when he was first born! This book was not for us at all."
1,worthless,"Here's the synopsis... swaddle your newborn, flip him on his tummy or side in your arms and make a loud shhhhh noise in his ear. That was the hole video. GOOD LUCK!"
2,Use Only if Necessary; Harsh Treatment of Newborns,"karp's techniques will probably work on most babies. if you really need to get back to regular pre-baby life, then, it may be a necessity. however, it is a bit rough and insensitive to treat a newborn like this. you gag them with a pacifier while their arms are wrapped up in a swaddle (like a straight jacket), then, you put them in a mechanical swing on the highest setting. while, they swing really fast, you put a loud white noise under them (which, can cause permanent hearing damage- do a google search first regarding teh white noise). far better to wear your baby in a sling or just hold your newborn most of the time. that way you get the added plus of bonding and you don't numb your little newborn.the DVD content is easy to watch. karp is likeable and warm. he has a gentle style. the newborns in the dvd are adorable so it's great for a first time pregnant mom to watch with her significant other."
2,The title is too big for the content of the DVD,"Yes, it describes how to calm your baby but never how to help your baby sleep longer."
3,Same as others.,The information is the same as other products. Nothing new. I didn't learn anything different and I still had the same problem. Not a DVD I'd recommend.
5,One word...awesome!,"This is a must for any soon to be parents. It's amazing to see how these techniques work so effectively. 5 stars all the way, don't think twice just buy it!"
5,Karp Is A Keeper,"Dr Karp really hit the nail on the head. Thank goodness someone had the common sense to remember Mother Wit. These are the actions that most mothers want to take anyway, but having been convinced for at least 3 generations that Father Knows Best, WE now know what works best. The dvd, is a perfect accompaniment to the book which describes in very plain language the part parents play in baby's physiological, emotional and neurological development. With what we know now Dr. Spock sounds like a complete lunatic. Finally, mothers and fathers can get some sleep and actually have fun soothing and calming their little bundles of joy. Running time 68 minutes with the ambient sounds bonus."
3,"Great tips, but...","When you are a new parent and have a collicky baby, this video is a great comfort. Dr. Karp presents his tips gently and demonstrates repeatedly over the course of the video. On watching it the first time, I remember thinking - hope!But...I thought the video was too short and Dr. Karp could have provided a lot more advice. Once I get my baby to stop crying while I'm practicing the 5's, how long should I continue to hold her? My baby has quieted down, but as soon as I put her down to rest she wakes and starts crying again. How long will this period last? When our baby cries, should I pick her up immediately? How do I try to get stuff done while going through this?Overall, I felt the video was helpful (hence the 3 stars), but other than: swaddle, shh, shake, side, & suck...there's not much here."
2,Not for reflux babies,"I'm sure these techniques work great for most fussy babies, but for our little one who had both colic and reflux i'm afraid no amount of swaddling, giggeling or shushing combined could sooth her. While I will say the video gives a great demonstration for swaddling which we used successfully for sleeping each night. Relief from the constant crying only came after she outgrew the reflux/colic stage - after 3 months, then like magic she was the happy baby we dreamed of. Please parents of fussy babies, don't be discouraged, while these techniques can only help, they may not be the solution you're praying for, but like so many difficult baby phases, this too shall pass."
5,New Mom Sanity,"I swear by this DVD. This should be offered along with the ""What to expect when your expecting"" book that I got from my doctor. My son, niece and nephew slept through the night from day one and had to be woken up at night to feed. This is a must gift for baby showers! I buy this for all expecting moms I know."
5,Happiest Baby on the Block,"I LOVE this video! Most of the moms in my breastfeeding support group have used this video to calm their babies during the ""fussy"" times. Many of us have watched the video over and over, learning how to perfect the techniques. As a nurse and lactation consultant, I have used the techniques very successfully with newborns and infants. There is a RARE baby who doesn't respond just like the babies in the video. It is amazing to watch them calm down instantly. This is a must-have for every parent of a newborn."
5,If only I had this DVD first time around,"This is the best $25 I think it have ever spent.The first 2 months of our twins has been easy compared to the first 2 months of our first daughter and I put it down 2 this DVD.You don't need the book, just get the DVD and watch carefully."
5,Real Happy Babies!!!,"This video is the real deal! I have used these techniques on my daughter, my nephews, and my friends' babies. I always buy this DVD for EVERY babyshower and for all of my friends who are expecting (i just bought 2 more!). These techniques work in less than a minute (sometimes instantaneously). You are able to spend more time cuddling, sleeping and getting other stuff done!It is AMAZING!!!"
5,Watch this DVD,"This is a must have, watch it during your 9th month so it will be fresh in your mind, and apply it right away when the baby is born.Although you may hear or read about Dr Karp's method, I suggest to watch the video because if you don't do it exactly right it doesn't work.This method works, and also in the video you'll find answers to many questions you may have and you'll also see how many parents are in the same boat, and you are not alone out there.I have to say that I went to Dr. Karp's web site and send him an email with a question and he answered it on the same day, I was so surprised!!"
5,Give this to anyone you know who is having a baby!,My daughter-in-law was given this by my daughter - and it has wonderful information!! I now give it to everyone at their baby showers. I wish it was handed out at the doctor's office and was required reading before delivery!
5,The Video Every Parent Needs to View,"This video is a great way to see Dr. Karp's 5 S's at work. See how to correctly swaddle your baby, see real babies reacting to the 5 S's and see real parents learning how to calm their babies. This video is easy to follow and the results are terrific!"
4,Will be watching this over and over again,"So I must admit that I purchased this before my child was born - he is Due this month. However, I do believe I will watch this video over and over again. I look forward to using the techniques to calm my child down. The seller shipped this product immediately. I was definitely pleased with the purchase and the overall transaction."
3,"Good Info, but you can get it all off the internet","The information was really good, but you can find most of it at your birthing class or the internet. If I did it over again, I would not have purchased it."
5,great advice,We used so many tips from this book and our baby was very receptive to them. Would highly recommend to any other parent.All tips were hands on things you can do that are simple and easy.
5,Happy Baby!,The techniques work! Glad I had this information for the first few months. Worth buying.
4,Watch this before your baby comes,"I got this movie from the library before my second son was born and required that everyone in the family watch it. My first son was a major crier, and I was determined to learn some soothing techniques for the second baby. Some of Dr. Karp's technique is nothing new (like swaddling), but watching the video definitely will give you the confidence and patience to remember all of the things you can do to soothe your baby. You won't be helpless to let him/her cry when you remember that you can help them!"
5,a must see for all expecting parents,"This is the best information available for new moms and dads on how to calm the baby. It will help a lot to watch it during the last trimester of pregnancy so that you will be prepared right from the birth of the child. Of course, you wont have time to watch the dvd once the baby is born."
5,The 5 S's get 5 stars! Dr. Karp Rules!!,"AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE FOR ANY NEW PARENT!! When our daughter was 2 and 3/4 weeks old we watched the ""Happiest baby..."" video and did everything Dr. Karp said. Immediately our daughter, started sleeping 5-6 hours through the night! By 6 weeks she was sleeping 6-8 hours through the night! People were jealous when we told them how well she was doing! My husband bought several copies to give to other new parents we know. It's my standard baby shower gift from now on! Dr. Karp and his 5 S's rule!"
5,this dvd changed our world!,"After my wife watched this DVD, and started using the techniques as demonstrated by Dr. Karp, our baby went from only sleeping 20 minutes at a time (if someone was holding him) to 5 hours in a row in his crib OVERNIGHT! My wife and I were walking zombies trading off for half of the night holding him in the living room so the other one of us could sleep. Someone let us borrow this DVD, and it changed our world. As a pediatrician myself, I have recommended this DVD to countless families and colleagues. It is a lifesaver for difficult babies."
5,Great help!!,I love this DVD. I used it with my son and couldn't find my old copy. I recommend it to anyone even if you have a content baby.
4,(Hopefully) helpful for new parents,"This was recommended by a friend, and it does have a lot of good tips. We've not yet had a chance to use them in practice, since we are still waiting on our daughter's arrival. We have stocked up on swaddling blankets and bought a swing, because of the video's advice. I also read the book, but I think you can get just as much from watching this short video."
5,This is an absolute MUST-HAVE for every new parent!!,"I get this DVD for EVERY baby shower I go to. And they're always SUPER grateful after they've had their baby!This was a LIFE-SAVER for us!! It will save you so much time and grief trying to calm your baby or get them to sleep. With the help of this DVD, my baby was sleeping through the night by 3 months or so of age. My relatives were amazed at how ""good"" my baby was everywhere we went, and how easy it was to calm him. My baby's almost 7 months now, and we still use some of the techniques from this.I'd recommend this MUCH better than the book, because you really need a visual. Don't bother getting the book. Just get the DVD. You'll be glad you did later."
5,It works please believe me,"I saw this in nursing school last year for my Maturnity rotation. I was really amazed by this. All of my classmates were eager to try this out this technique.I tried it on one of my patients baby and it worked!! I swore I would buy this if I ever got pregnant. Well a year later I became pregnant and now Im 9 months with my first baby, so this is a must have."
5,Don't have a baby without this!,We've had six babies and didn't know about this method until after the fourth was born. What a difference this can make for ANY baby--fussy or not. We've given a lot of these as baby gifts and have had more praise from parents than any other suggestion! The methods work--hands down. We've also been involved with fussy and difficult babies and this is the ONLY 'stuff' that works every time---even in the middle of the store when your baby starts crying at the top of her lungs! Methods are easy to do and simple to repeat.Don't have a baby without this!
5,love!,"an absolute MUST for 1st time parents and any parent who has never seen this dvd. i watched it 4 times and i swear it saved me so many times my baby was crying. i call this guy ""the baby whisperer""."
5,Rediscovering a timeless truth,"Both the video and book bring an interesting angle to the subject. It has been most helpful with a reflux baby. I would agree with his concept of a fourth trimester if you look at a when a baby's interactive and functional skills start to really come into play. A book that goes hand in hand with this is:Colic Solved: The Essential Guide to Infant Reflux and the Care of Your Crying, Difficult-to- Soothe Baby"
3,Can you Swaddle?,"If you don't get the swaddling right, that's the end! It does not work! My daughter is so active she would not keep still while I swaddled her - her hands were moving all over the place and she was kicking fiercely (she is only 3weeks old); and she was howling as well. The babies on the video were a lot calmer than her.I watched the swaddling part of the video over and over again, but to no success"
2,didn't work for my baby,"With all the great reviews I was sure this would work for my daughter. It didn't. I tried swaddling, rocking, shushing, and pacifying. Though I realize the ""5 S's"" take practice, after several attempts I just never got her to stop crying with any of the techniques. Though she may fit more into the ""high needs"" catagory than the colicky baby one.The one part of the DVD I did find helpful, however, was swaddling her and putting her in the swing. I'd get her to sleep 3-4 hours straight while I got some housework done."
2,Not as expected,"Video and or music would not play on blue ray player. Could only watch on my laptop.Video was poorly made considering the cost, looked like one of my highschool projects. On the upside the information provided has proved to save our life when the baby gets upset!!! I would recommend watching but would suggest you buy a used copy or split with group of expecting moms. You only need to watch once or twice to get the idea!"
4,"corney, but really works","My husband and I first came across this video during a newborn care class we took from the hospital where we delivered. Although the shushing sounds obnoxious, it honestly, really does work. We live by the swaddle, swing and shushing...our poor little one has acid reflux and is very colicky, but this video really did help!!!"
5,I would rate it 100 stars if possible!,"Our 6 week old is just as fussy/colicky/high needs as our first one was (everyone said it could never happen again!)- After trying everything again (changing my diet incase it was a nursing issue, the vacuum cleaner, wondering what we were doing wrong again!) I ordered this video. I cried when I saw his technique, because seeing the babies on the video reminded me exactly of my two girls, and I knew it would work for my 6 week old. Luckily I was right! She is happy, content, and we have no guilt or wondering what we are doing wrong as parents! Now we can calm her and satisfy her needs. We are so thrilled- I will ask my pediatrician to recommend this video to parents of similar babies"
4,"Simple, but often effective. Slightly cheesy guy.","Dr. Karp gives the same 5-step program for hushing crying babies that he gives in the book. I think it is probably worth getting the DVD instead of the book, because it is useful to see the techniques demonstrated. He shows them repeatedly, different situations, different babies. He also shows the techniques not working sometimes, which is good - and then he shows what to do next. Karp has a slightly cheesy presentation, and always speaks in a soothing monotone that drives me a little crazy, but I got more value from this than I expected."
4,I loved it!,I bought it for my know-it-all husband for Father's Day. It amazed us both to find out how many misconceptions he had about the rules of his favorite sports! I did almost as well as he did!
5,WE NEED GOD BACK IN OUR LIVES NOW!,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCTS I HAVE BOUGHT IN MY WHOLE LIFE. THE SONGS ARE BEAUTIFUL, THE DINAMICS OF THE LIRICS CAN TAKE YOU TO SPECIAL PLACES, IT'S AN INVITATION TO TAKE GOD SERIOUSLY, AND A PRAYER FOR THE SALVATION OF OUR WORLD. I LOVE THIS WORSHIP!"
5,Great movie of life in the early 60's,"Good family movie that ties family issues (father and son trying to cope with the boy's mother's mental illness) with current events - mainly the first moon landing. The lead actors are very good (Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgh), but the child actor (Ryan Todd) steals the show. He is outstanding in his struggles to accept his mother's illness but still try to get some enjoyment out of life."
3,moon,a great idea but with very unnecessary language. i would not recomend it for families or younger ones. they should have kept it clean for everyone.
1,Down With Danson!,"Pontiac Moon is a movie that you have to see...because it's so terrible! There are so many parts of the movie that don't need to be there...like when Washington (Ted Danson) visits his freak brother I mean whats the point. Anyway, you must rent this movie. It will always be on the shelf at the movie rental store...because this movie STINKS!"
5,I like this CD!,"This is one of the best CD's with renditions of Zep songs. Acoustic (acoustic guitar, bass, drums, and vocals) versions are very refreshing. My favorite songs on this CD are Whole Lotta Love and Rock 'n' Roll."
1,"rebeck's putrid, imbecilic work a must to avoid","this woeful, post-feminist drivel is about as lamebrained as anything concocted by gloria steinem in her glorious bedroom moments getting plowed by the negroe jim brown. rebeck's own moronic insights, barely comprehensible to cro=magnon man, much less a literate audience, aren't worth the price of a penny candy. she needs to go back to english 101, maybe at notre dame or holy cross junior college (where she went, says stevie bochco, who let rebeck be his token 'white girl' on NYPD pink) and learn how to complete a sentence without the whining, mawkish garbage she's known for: on stage, on tv and throughout her writing 'career'; she's set back catholic writers in hollywood and off-broadway 400 years. with imbeciles like her writing for mass entertainment, can another inquisition be far away?"
1,Pee-u,"I grow weary of this kind of gimmicky approach to art, industry and political illusion thrust upon us as cool or intelligent cultural currency. Give something a relationship somehow to something else and it becomes equal to it. What nonsense! Let a creation stand on it's on.This film is irksome, pretentious fiddle faddle and little more. I knew the drudge by the sound of a grotesques score crawling under my skin with the menu. Who cares whether it's homage-ish or not? I wasn't able to endure but 5 minutes of it before leaping to the eject and purging my soul with a bowl of organic ice cream."
1,A time Waster,"In the tradition of Film Noir, this film is a very poor one.....a plot like Swiss cheese and loaded with stereotypes that lead nowhere.......voiceover.....camera angles.......the sum FAR less than the parts."
3,"Message movie, but what is the message?","This private eye wants his wife back, but the man he is trailing has a wife who he doesn't want to see again. Get it? This little film is kind of a throw-back to film-noire. The detective is either drunk or hung over through most of the action. A rich woman in NYC, and a brokerage firm, are willing to pay $500,000 to track down some schmuck who disappeared after 9/11. See, he decided to change his life and now helps needy orphans, or some such. Only he doesn't want to go home again, ever. This is just ok."
1,BO...RING!,I wish I could say this movie was like watching paint dry but that would've been more exciting. It's just about an alcoholic private investigator (Michael Shannon) who follows a man with a kid. There's some spoilers there but not interesting enough to mention. The only positive thing about this was I didn't pay for it. I saw it on On Demand and fast forwarded through most of it.Save your time and your money. Watching a faucet drip is more entertaining.
2,Disappointing......,"I agree with the other reviews that this book does delivera good explanation on classloaders, serialization, JNI andreflection. The explanation of classloaders is one of thebest I've read. The chapter on serialization goes intothe details on customizing serialization, etc. And theJNI explanation is fine.However, this book does NOT discuss component developmentin Java. There is no attempt to bring together theseadvanced Java topics and explain how they are used todevelp Java Components. In fact, outside of a smallexample in Chapter 1, there are no examples of componentsin this book.This book is misnamed. It should be called somethinglike ""advanced java programming."" If you're lookingfor that book which teaches component development inJava, you won't find it here."
5,"A great book, but buy ""Structures"" instead","This book is part of the Princeton Science Library, the best collection of books on mathematics and science for the intelligent layman. Like other books in that series, it is succinct and clearly written. I read it and thoroughly enjoyed it. All of the positive reader reviews are right on.Because I liked it so much, I purchasedStructures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Downalso by Professor Gordon. As it turned out, that book covers the same material, but in greater breadth and depth, and with more illustrations. There's much to be said for reading both books, but if you're only going to read one, ""Structures"" is the one."
5,A modern classic,"This postwar book about materials science walks you through the basics of statics and materials in a simple and straightforward way, accompanied by excellent stories of wartime research."
4,Great book so far.,"Red the first 5 chapters by now. seems like a great book so far! If you liked the "" structures"" book you re going to love this one."
4,Very good movie... and even featuring Timothy Dalton !,"Firstly, I'm a huge James Bond fan. Therefore, I'd die for an action movie with Bond star, and especially Timothy Dalton. But not only that makes this film very good - it has good story, very good play, great actors (Timothy Dalton ! Omar Shariff !), and a strong production - yes, there could be good moves even with that budget ! And, sometimes filming locations will play deja-vu with you - ""hey, isn't it a Living Daylights ???""."
2,Sorry to think how it could have been...,"If you're a great Timothy Dalton fan ( as I am! ), probably you'll make it to the end of the film Eif not, I don't know if there's much I can guarantee.Altogether, I think the film could have been much much better. I couldn't get rid of the impression that I was watching some cheap soap drama, and it only made me wonder how Timothy could be happy being a part of it ( although not so much as I did when I saw 'Cleopatra'). Like another reviewer, I think he's sometimes inclined to waste his talent on some funny filmsEAs for the accent, I had a hard time convincing myself that he was a CIA agent EI wasn't sure if he was even trying to sound American ( Not having read the book, I thought he must be an American brought up in the UKE.With Timothy and Omar Sharif, I'm only sorry that the film had to come out this way."
1,Read the book - the vhs tape is a waste of time and $,"Great book; lousy movie.British actors doing American accents, and doing them poorly. Hilarious at times but mostly just plain awful. That anyone could butcher a Follett novel so thoroughly is an achievement of sorts in itself. If you want to see a Follett book come to life, see Eye of the Needle. Now that's a movie! END"
5,Finally! Pet for my wind-up Neutron Man!,"My wind-up Neutron Man was getting lonely, so I bought him the wind-up Space Dog. Now Neutron Man is happy. We were both disappointed that Space Dog doesn't bark, though. Oh well. At least he doesn't keep up the neighbors."
1,The Fast Forward Button is Your Friend,"Alrighty, here's the truth of this movie...its supposed to be an actiony/drama, but seriously, its FUNNY. I mean really! In normal circumstances, I'd say stay away from this film, but if you're a fan of any of the actors (I'm a JRM fan) then its worth a watch. Don't take it seriously though, because you may hurt yourself or your television, however. Just realize your watching it because you love the actors..."
2,wasted cast,its about a young boy(Meyers) who falls prey to his older brother(Modine) and he enters into a life of crime. boring to say the least but Modine sorta is good as always and Meyers is sorta alittle pretty boy fanstasy for the ladies but whats the point really. its intersting but never quite adds up and I fell alseep at some point
3,Not a good movie,"Well I bought this movies because I have a thing for Michael Madsen (even though alot of his movies aren't that great,)I've been really into the show Weeds and I couldn't remember any movies I had seen Mary Louise Parker in, and I love Fairuza Balk. Sadly to say this movies sucked, the story line is just stupid to me. As I watched I remembered that I had seen the movie on channel 20 (houston channel formerly UPN, now MY NETWORK TV or my20) where they play alot of B movies on the weekends, every now and then I might catch something not to bad, but I remembered turning this movie after the brother gets pulled while having to pee real bad. Don't waste your money, I'm sure it with will come on regular t.v. again someday and only watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or watch. I only gave it three stars because it arrived promptly and in good condition."
5,Definitive book and wonderful discovery,"This book, originally published in 1961, was David J. Dallin's last book. Having read and enjoyed his earlier book, ""Soviet Foreign Policy from 1939-1942"" I anticipated a good read. However, I was bowled over by the book. David Dallin writes without a hint of ideology about a topic that very few others have written about in such a unbiased way. Furthermore, to write in this manner during the Cold War and during the very end of the ""Red Scare"" makes this book truly remarkable.The book deals with Soviet Foreign policy of the Malenkov/Bulganin government as well as the foreign policy of the early Khruschev years. I don't know yet what the political beliefs of David Dallin are. His writing is free of any hint. His coverage of the subject matter is just plain good. The style of writing is like that of a novel. Finishing the book, I was left wanting more. I have since proceeded to collect and read other books by this author.Brian Wayne Wells"
2,Recycled Tubes is Eco Friendly but not When U have to Buy New Stuff,I bought this pouch a while ago and discovered that rubber stitched at it's edge and subjected to the elements (sun hot cold) degrades faster than fabric. Unfortunately for me I was mountain biking down an extended rough trail and discovered the bag torn at the rubber seam at the bottom. The contents were gone. It was good for a few years tho.
1,Bad Design,"The strap that attaches this bag to your seat goes over the zipper track. (Look at the picture.) You can't open the zipper without undoing the strap. So this bag is too inconvenient for carrying car keys, which is why I wanted it."
2,Railroad Empire has fallen,"Train continuously derailed at switching unit or stopped for no reason as it passed over the cross guard. In my opinion, the bridge trusses cause the track to enter the switching unit too steep and causes the train to derail. The engine alone does fine, but derails when cars are added. Neither is the track connection design as solid and durable as it appears. Can't enjoy something like this with your son if you're constantly having to re-rail the train. Quality of design and components not what I expected."
3,Very cute lamp w/ 1 safety issue,"The lamp is adorable and now that my son is 1 year old, it draws his attention. He loves the fact that you can spin the parts around to see different pictures on the base. My only complaint about it it that the on/off switch is on the cord, which keeps you from being able to tuck it behind whatever you set it on. Consequently he has pulled it down from the bookcase 2-3 times now trying to get to it. It is the only thing in his room I cannot babyproof, otherwise I can let him play in his room while I fill the bathtub or be in there putting away his clothes with him on the other side of the room without worring. Putting the switch on the lamp stem itself, like most lamps, would have been much smarter & safer. Besides, whay toddler doesn't like to explore buttons? And who wantes them exploring electrical cords?"
3,Smaller than expected ...,"The quality of manufacturing is OK. The pieces for Chinese checkers are made of plastic and plug into the holes in the board. I was expecting marbles so I'm a little disapointed. The other tokens and chess pieces are made from wood. The instructions for all games come on a single double sided piece of paper, in other words next to useless."
2,No Way! -- Plastic Marbles!,"This set uses plastic pieces instead of glass marbles. If you love chinese checkers, the plastic is a big turn off. We returned ours, it just wasn't the same as the real thing."
4,Decent Book,"The magic word here is ""free.""The book is not excellent or spellbinding, but it is decent -- concentrating on the French's loss of Canada in the 18th Century.The author's storytelling powers are not mesmorizing, but they are adequate and the book (not a very long one) is easy to finish in a couple sittings.The book is riddled with more than a few typos, but -- again -- givent the $0.00 cost, this is very much forgiveable.Definitely a ""good read"" for any history buff and extremely educational on an, unfortunately, all-but-forgotten segment of history."
4,Does What It Says,"These chips provide exactly what you desire... smoke, and lots of it. I can't say that I discerned any flavor characteristics of apple, but I was more interested in the smoke flavor component anyhow. If you are doing a little grilling and want to add the flavor of barbecue smoking, these chips will do you right."
5,Excellent book,"Would recommend anyone with a pet have this book, it is laid out nicely with very useful information. It has come in handy several times for me, even with the internet it is nice to have a physical guide on hand."
5,Save a Pet,"This book just might save your pet's life.Like CPR buys time to save a humam life, this book buys time to save your pets life and also helps you from doing the wrong thing."
4,companion kit for dogs and cats paper back,"The book is in great shape and is new, however, it took too long to receive it & I wouldn't purchase another book from a1 because of the length of time it took to recieve it."
5,I found this book a must-have for pet professionals,"I own Animal Companions pet sitting service in Houston, Texas, and I found this book a must-have for pet professionals. Laid out in a format similar to a Physician's Desk Reference, you may easily and quickly (and time is always of the essence with a sick pet!) look up information based on presenting symptoms.It is an amazing supplement to hands-on first aid training. I immediately purchased a copy of this book for myself and each of my employees, to keep in our cars right next to our pet first aid kit. I also picked up a copy to keep at home, for my own furry loved ones."
3,Solid & durable,"OK .. so this is what u call a must have tool in the rc world. you will use it when installing servo's. The built quality is great, its sold, durable and has a good strong hand grip. The only downside is that it needs someone one is average knowledge of how to Z-Bend wires, so as not to make them shorter than they should. Also it would have been nice to have a servo guide installed in the Z-Bend to make its a sure hassle free bend."
5,Nipping any cold in the bud (if taken fast enough),"Gaia's Quick Defense is phenomenal. I make sure to have it on hand at all times, and I'm now going to take it at the first sign of cold-like symptoms. It works like a charm, nipping any cold in the bud if taken fast enough. And if not taken fast enough, at least it shortens the duration quite noticeably."
3,Placebo effect? 10 pills per day? Only a two day supply!,"The good news is that most of the reviews for this product have been positive, what's lacking is true scientific research to validate its claim that it provides a quick immune defense/boost. That means comparing it to a placebo. I suspect (but have no proof) that most of the positive effect can be explained by the placebo effect.I was just getting over a cold and felt another one come on. I took these pills and I didn't get sick. But maybe that's because I slept well. Or because of the placebo effect. There are many factors.So you're paying $17 for two-days worth of pills. There are 20 pills, and you're supposed to take 10 pills per day. So it's pretty pricey - but that may be worth it if it prevents a cold that will knock you out for a week.Buy it only if you believe it will work."
4,Works great but not for everyone,I took some of these last year when I had a cold and it was gone in just a few days. It basically supercharges your immune system which enables you to fight it off better. Note that it will not work for everyone or with all respiratory ailments.
1,Didn't work at all for me.,"As luck would have it, the day I got this bottle of Quite Defense, I was starting Day 1 of the flu. I took it as directed, but I didn't get better any quicker than I normally do."
3,Get it if echinacea helps your resistance to colds,"Echinacea works for me. It's not some kind of silver bullet, but it definitely helps me when I'm catching a cold or recovering from one. I used this product at the optimal time as instructed, and I believe it helped. In one instance I did come down with a cold, the typical kind that doesn't stop you from going to work but makes you miserable all day. However, I don't expect echinacea to prevent colds in the same way that vaccinations prevent certain illnesses.Some people swear that echinacea doesn't help them. I believe it helps me and I think it's a kind of wonder herb. This product seems to have a good dosage of quality echinacea so I recommend it for those that benefit from this herb."
3,I sorta think it worked ... for a while.,"It seemed to ward off for a while and then reduce the symptoms of a cold -- and then I ran out, and, er, succumbed. I would get a big bottle of this next time around. I mean, who knows for sure, but while I was taking it, I really thought I'd beat my cold while taking it."
4,Seems to be Helpful,"I've tried a few of the Gaia Herbs products and feel that they are helpful. I'm not 100% sold on this one yet. It can be hard to evaluate something which is more geared towards being 'preventative.' Still, I think the product has been helpful when it was taken at the onset of symptoms. So, cautiously, I would say, yes it is effective. I would want to try it again a couple of times before declaring for certain that it works. I do think it was helpful."
2,Not impressed,"One dose = one bottle. 5x2 pills for two days. With the caveat on the label: repeat as needed. Which would be another bottle. 2 pills 5x a day is a little crazy even for a vitamin nut like me.Someone in my office was getting sick. So I took these bad boys, instead of vitamin C but kept my normal Orange Triad/ Alive alternating regimen, as well as Acidopholis and salmon and cod liver oils. I skipped my normal once weekly cold shower.Ive been sick for nearly 3 days. This is the worst cold I've had in years. I'm still sick. I'm all about homeopathic medicines and herbs, and maybe without these my cold would have been way worse. But if this cold keeps up for another couple days, I'm looking at 3 of these bottles. Today I took a behind the counter mucinex and im feeling much better. Maybe for someone who takes less serious multivitamins it would have a more noticable effect..."
2,Didn't perform as expected,"Every time I get a cold, the first thing that relatives tell me is to take echinacea (and/or zinc) to prevent its onset. I have tried zinc, which in the end proved to give me severe migranes and make me sicker than the cold itself.But, I'm always willing to give natural cures a second try. I thought this was the perfect opportunity to try out the Gaia Herbs 20-capsule Quick Defense that I received recently.The Gaia Quick Defense has Echinacea, Ginger Root and Elderberry. Supposedly, echinacea is supposed to be good at boosting the immune system, especially when fighting colds.But it didn't work for me. Unfortunately, when I took this at the onset of a cold, it did not stop my cold from developing. In fact, I ended up losing my voice for a few days.Sadly, my search for a better, more natural way to cure a cold continues. Until then, I'll stick with my Dayquil and Nyquil."
2,Didn't help me at all,"I was starting to get a runny nose and started taking this as directed. It did not seem to make a difference, and I was sick for about a week. I do not normally take anything other than a multivitamin, so I don't know if that makes a difference. Everyone reacts differently, and I don't know if I had a virus (I want to be fair to the product). It is fairly costly, as this is a one treatment box! Also, there seem to be too many contraindications for my liking, and they recommend consulting your physician before taking. I wouldn't use this again, nor can I recommend it."
2,Didn't notice any difference,"I take airborne and lots a vitamin C when I get colds. Thought what the heck, why not give Gaia Herbs Quick Defense a shot. I didn't realize you take 2 pills 5x a day. Wow that was difficult. I have a hard enough time swallowing 1 pill one time a day. I tried it & have to say I didn't notice any difference. I did end up with a horrible cold. Lasted 2 weeks. I have to say though I started it on the night of the second day. Maybe that had something to do with it. Not sure, although probably won't try it again unless they come out with a better dosing instruction with less pills to take daily."
4,It might have worked,"A sore throat in the area of my left tonsil prompted me to try Quick Defense. That symptom almost always means I'm coming down with a head cold. I started the 2-day regimen as directed within 30 minutes of feeling that first symptom. The next morning, the symptom was gone, and it didn't come back. I did not get a cold. Did the Echinacea boost my immunity to fight off a viral infection? I can't say for sure. But in at least this one instance, I followed the product directions and got the result it purports to offer. Quick Defense can't legally promise anything because the product hasn't been evaluated by the FDA, so if it doesn't work for you, don't expect to get your money back. One suggestion: swallow the caps one at a time, not both both at once. They're large and float in your mouthful of water, so they go down easier one at a time."
2,Might Help,"I took at the onset of flu and may have experienced slightly milder outcome... who knows? On the other hand, it certainly didn't hurt. I'll try it again."
4,I think it works,I had the 20 capsule Quick Defense for awhile waiting for an opportunity to try it. Recently I had a runny nose and a sore throat which is how most of my colds start. I took two capsules of Quick Defense five times a day (which is instructed). That means you'll finish off your bottle trying to stop one cold. I have to admit I did feel better the next day and didn't end up with anything worse than the sore throat and runny nose for another day. Not sure I'd pay out of pocket to try it for a future cold.
3,I believe Echinacea works,"To review a product like this is not a simple thumbs-up / thumbs-down matter. Product effectiveness can and will vary between different people. The ingredients contained are all reasonably acceptable for human consumption (as the manufacturer suggests, always consult your doctor first).When I have felt under the weather I have taken Echinacea with satisfactory results. Quick Defense should give the same results. The manufacturer seems straighforward with their ingredients list and directions, making no wild claims. That is good reason to choose one brand over another.Will Quick Defense be right for you? Again, consult a doctor to be sure there are no conflicts with other medications you take or conditions you have that would suggest you don't take this supplement, and then make your informed decision to buy it or not."
3,Works Well!,"I took this at the first hint of coming down with a head cold that my kids were passing around. I managed to take the recommended dosage for one day, two capsules five times a day. You are supposed to take the capsules for two days but after taking it for one day, I found myself feeling much better. It seemed to work for me. I never came down with the head cold.I think the product is a bit pricey but I might be willing to try it again the next time I feel a cold coming on. The only other complaint I have is that it is a lot of pills to be taking in a two day period."

3,Lile it was watered down,Wife loves the smell but it did not last long. It was like it was watered down. It is not like it used to be.
5,Great Dictionary,The Spanish-English Dictionary was exactly what I needed. It is easy to use and well put together.
2,Not as good as the first book,"I loved the first book Yadayada Prayer Group, so I immediately ordered this audiobook. The reader Barbara Rosenblat is the only thing that kept my interest in this book. But even with her voices, I found the book boring. Will not read any other books in this series."
2,"Jodi, Jodi, Jodi!!!!","This book was not inspiring, enjoyable or bearable. The book should be called ""Jodi"". The book focused on her and her alone. Characters are introduced in this book and never elaborated on or broken down into detail. If there is an issue with another character it was never addressed well enough to be resolved. The whole MaDear incident was not realistic on how it was handled. There needs to be realism in a book related to religion. And for the record, the prayer group never ""Got Down""!!!!"
4,Yada Yada YEAH!,"This follow-up to the first Yada Yada Prayer Group book is a little slower-paced than the first, but contains plenty of drama and excitement. Where the first book ignited a passion for heartfelt praise, this novel draws the reader deeper into a bare-bones examination of the road to overcoming personal prejudices. It challenges us to look at how we LIVE our faith, and to strengthen our relationships with fellow believers. The short-view: Slower, and deeper impact."
4,Great Read!,"Neta Jackson is a wonderful author. I am two books in on the Yada Yada Prayer Group series and I have enjoyed both books! The characters and story lines are realistic, refreshing, and relatable...they spark an array of emotions...A good read, anywhere, anytime."
5,The Yada Yada Prayer Group,"This series is one of the most refreshing and inspirational group of books I have ever read. I have completed all 7 and could easily read them again. The characters are real people who have a strong faith in God and depend on each other for human support and accountability. YOu'll laugh, cry and rejoice."
4,yada yada Prayer group gets down,"I purchased the audio book #2 (CDs) to use in conjunction with the book for our church book club. We meet every other Saturday, listen to the CD and then discuss the chapters and list and offer up prayers for anyone who requests a prayer. We did similarly last spring with the first book, but only had 4 or 5 women participating. This fall we have doubled that number."
1,The Light of Krishnamurti,The Light of Krishnamurti is not in this book. The author freely uses the name of Krishnamurti to promote a very boring autobiography. Mrs. Blackburn does not contribute in any form to advance the knowledge about this profound and spiritual leader.
1,Not about Krishnamurti,"It's a book about 'the light', whatever that means. If you believe in spirits, magic, astral travel and all that mumbo jumbo, you will probably enjoy this book. Otherwise, skip it. It is not about Krishnamurti, there's not even one page dedicated to a discussion of his life or ideas. I don't know why Mrs Blackburn put Krishnamurti's name on the cover if all she wanted to do was to write about herself. Maybe she's well aware that with a more appropriate title, like ""The Autobiography of Gabriele Blackburn"", she wouldn't have found a publisher."
5,Vegetables at their best.,"Janet Ballantyne knew just how to put together a comprehensive information book about vegetables. As a person who grows my own vegetables, I found Ms. Ballantyne's tips about how to grow them, what to do if you are plagued by pests that are common, and the best way to cook them to get the most out of them to be the most valuable book on my cookbook shelf. Her do's and don't and why were enlightening. I have spent days reading the book from cover to cover. When I work in either my garden or my kitchen, I have a new confidence in enjoying the labors of my work thanks to this book. If you are an avid gardener who likes to get the best of out of what you plant, you should own this book."
2,Good info but long-winded and poorly written,In my opinion this book is poorly written and long-winded. The author could have explained everything in a book half the size. His explanations are not entertaining either.The author is obviously well versed in chaos theory but lacks the ability to write a good book. For a good read on a similar topic that is much better written try The Black Swan by Taleb or The (MIS)Behavior of Markets by Mandelbrot.
4,Essence of chaos book by E.Lorenz,"Lorenz did a great job when he wrote this book!The very first time when I heard of chaos theory was year ago while watching some old documentary about Nostadamus. In film was mentioned chaos theory and said that acceptance of it by many people could change whole look to life and so on. Movie left to me questions - what is that theory, what it's standing for.Finaly my interest lead me to this book and it clearly showed me what kind of staff is that chaos theory! That was and is really intriguing!Book is well written. There was of course some places that wasn't easy to understand. I myself have studied high math,encountered differential equations but anyway had some difficulties. That's why not 5 stars to book - it's really not for absolutely everyone although almost close to it. I couldn't stop it reading, I was done in two days.This book encouraged me for further reading."
4,This is the book if you're looking for a chaos primer,"If your interest in Chaos was piqued by Gleick's book on the subject, you may have found it unsatisfying. While it conveyed a enthusiasm for chaos, it only superficially answered questions about what characterizes a chaotic system. ""The Essence of Chaos"" is a much better book for gaining an understanding of chaos, mainly because it includes a discussion of the mathematics. Both authors strive to avoid mathematics as much as possible, but in the end, I believe Lorenz achieves a better balance. He only touches lightly on the math, but without that, it's impossible to understand what makes a system chaotic. He doesn't quite go so far as to show a practical application of chaos theory, but a clear and concise example of that probably doesn't exist yet. But, he does achieve the goal of demonstrating and examining the fascinating characteristics of a chaotic system."
2,A lot of info poorly binded,"I think that the book touches a interesting subject, but itself fails to be interesting or compelling to the casual reader.As another reviewer mentioned the same book could have taken half of the space.Dissapointed but i still managed to plough through it .."
2,snap opens too easily,"I was looking for an ID Holder that you can wear on your belt. It looks very stylish and it's handy because of the extra pockets for a credit card on the back side. The ""leather"" is very stiff at the beginning but gets soft very soon. However that doesn't prevent the snap from opening by itsself every time I bend over or sit down. That makes it pretty much useless, because now I have to worry about losing my ID all the time."
2,A little weak,"A friend sent me this book to read.The author, Walters, seems to be of the self-help school and uses a lot of literary license.from page 1 of the book:....Perhaps, then, that ancient saying should be amended to read, ""The love of money is the root of all evil.""Too bad Mr. Walters Bible knowledge isn't as good as his knowledge of the Bhagavad Vita, because the Bible says exactly what he is saying ""the ancient saying should be amended to say"".(It says it in 1 Timothy 6:10)Like I said, that was page 1.....it kind of goes downhil from there."
5,I liked it.,"This is a marvellous book, The only guide you'll ever need.Everywhere in Milan worth going to, staying at or seeing is in here and anywhere that isn't, isn't.The photography is excellent, the writing is sublime.You don't have to bother going to Milan anymore, just get this book instead."
4,Camel lites,"I just saw this concert DVD for the first time (I've only been listening to Camel for nine months), and I have to say, I'm quite amazed. The video quality and editing is top-notch, the band is tight, the mix is good (perhaps a tad keyboard and reverb heavy, but this was the 80s), and is a good career overview leading up to '84.Stationary Traveller is moderately represented, and while it's not my favorite Camel album, the songs turn out much better live than the studio. Andy Latimer is the only original band member here, and plays guitar with an incredible amount of passion. It's somewhat similiar to David Gilmour's tone on a few tracks, but a little lighter and faster at times. He also provides the main vocals and occasional flute.Total Pressure is an expanded version of their Pressure Points VHS/DVD, and includes several bonus songs (almost 1/3rd is new here) and an interview from 1984-85.Highly recommended for fans of either classic prog or AOR. There's something to love for everyone."
1,I wasn't impressed...,"I'm afraid the authors, while seeming to desire catering to the novice, merely came across as condescending with their choice of phrasing. The book is not set up very intuitively, nor does it lend itself well to general troubleshooting. The troubleshooting offered is positioned in areas of focus that would be difficult to determine without considerable knowledge up front, as opposed to assisting in isolating a problem step-by-step. Further, instead of helping identify parts, etc., the authors seem to assume that you have a thorough overall knowledge of your particular motor, and offer no path to that information. In its defense, the book does go into great detail about disassembling and cleaning or rebuilding different devices and systems. But again, it doesn't help you determine problems, so who'd know what to disassemble? Sorry kids, but major thumbs down on this one."
2,Review,This book helped in troubleshooting my problem but said absolutely nothing about how to fix it.
3,To Small For price,"revell was always known for great models, but thier smaller kits are very hard to assemble and lack the impact of the larger ones"
2,ummm..... small,"Wow, surprised on the size of this, not a big model. If your hands are bigger than an 8 year olds, bett get a different model."
5,It works!,"Weight Loss Tracker is a great book for those who are searching for a lifestyle change and ultimately, permanant weight loss. The authors of the text help readers to understand that there is no magic cure for taking off the pounds. Instead, readers learn that subtle changes in diet and consistent exercise habits can make all of the difference. In an age of gastric bypass, freeze-dried packaged foods, and food deprivation as ways to weight loss, this book is a welcome alternative."
4,Hidden (Nutrition) Secrets Revealed!,"I am looking at Nutrition Labels now, thanks to this book.I traded in the ""Lite"" crackers from the health food store (0% fiber and loaded with sodium) for the Whole Wheat ones with 12% fiber (and less salt).And guess what? The high fiber ones made me feel fuller and so, I didn't need as many with my luncheon salad!-Former Idiot from Stamford, CT"
1,Can holder that does not hold!,"I was anticipating this because I have a BMW with flimsy cup holders. The rubber quality is nice as is the color, but I was not able to get to hold on the door!"
3,"Ditto on please, someone do the CD for Come to the Meadow.","The tease on Sat PM on NPR is just frustrating and ever since that program (Selected Shorts) began, I have been searching for the music in any form. I am delighted to see something of Kellaway being reproduced and will order this and hope that soon I can order ""Come to the Meadow."""
1,Injustice,"The 1974 LP ""Come to the Meadow"" by the same Cello Quartet is the most sensational music I have ever heard. I was hoping that the music in this CD would comfort me, but it has only caused me to crave the Meadow all the more."
4,NPR Interlude Music,"This is a wonderful, half-classical half-jazz album which I've loved since it came out in 1971. It is often featured between segments on National Public Radio.However the 2nd RKCQ album ""Come To The Meadow"" (1974) is even better. Why hasn't THAT one been reissued on CD???"
5,Transaction OK,Very good product. Thank you very much. Excellent vendors. Amazon is the best page product sales in which I purchased. 100% recommended
1,a HUGE disapointment,"this made me cry. rhapsody went so downhill on this cd. they even fall out of the powermetal category. dont buy this cd. if you really wanna hear it download it. its not worth the money. if you want real rhapsody buy dawn of victory, or power of the dragonflame."
2,I am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort,"I was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as Rhapsody (name changed due to copyright issues) on their 2006 live album Live in Canada. I have to say that I am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort. The group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music. The vocals tend to be oversung, or drowned out by the chaos in the background. Rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements, Rhapsody of Fire puts you to sleep with them. The group does stay true to their fantasy themes however."
4,metal film score alright but not the old rhapsody,"i have to say it hurts me to see my most beloved power metal band go different ways. im talking about ""dawn of victory"" was power, melody, hard in some way. i lovd it. rhapsody started this new era of metal film score with the last album ""symphony of enchated lands part II"" its good music, god storywriting but as it claims more a film than a powermetal album. the only exception beeing the long ""deamon night""song. the rest easy to listen, nicely produced but ""boring"" for you metalheads out there who seek power anda groove to bang to.i love rhapsody but the new ways of lucas solo career and this rhapsody of firelets me miss the old band even more."
5,I can't believe my ears,"This album totally blows away all expectations. Rhapsody of Fire is on fire and their new sounds are even harder hitting than their old, but they still keep true to their symphonic metal roots. BUY THIS ALBUM!"
3,Don't fix what isn't broken,"The original version of ""In Your Room"" brings me to tears. It's powerful, beautiful, dark, and emotional. The Zephyr mix that they have been using on tour(Singles and Exciter), which is on this single, just doesn't live up to what was once a masterpiece. Zephyr is more conventional, and mellow, and loses momentum before the third verse, instead of crashing into you with full force as the original does. But even a bad move for DM beats anything else that's out today!"
2,A song viciously murdered,"When I've heard ""In your room"" for the first time while listening to the ""Songs of faith and devotion"" album I was sure it is going to be a single sooner of later. To my opinion it is the best song in the album, and one of Depeche Mode's best songs. The song had the sound of the classic DM - the sound that made these guys a legendary pop group.So when the single went out, I wasn't surprised, and I went to buy the cd-single the moment it arrived to the stores. I was dumbfounded.The single remix is the most evil thing someone can do to a tune! Instead of getting a brilliant DM track, you will get a boring rocky version that lacks all the darkness of the original version, and sounds like a bad cover from an unsuccessfull rock band.This song is fantastic, so go and buy the album. Don't waste your money on this thing."
5,A nice little book.,"The English People by George Orwell is a great little book about the English people. Their character, their faults, their merits and their future. Orwell, as in most of his books, holds nothing back. He hits the nail right on the head and cares nothing for the feelings of his readers. Hate him or love him, you have to respect him.I am REALLY proud of my copy as, if you check the inside front cover, you will find it was a gift to somebody in 1947! A first edition.And his advice to the English people on how to protect their future?""They must breed faster, work harder, and probably live more simply, think more deeply, get rid of their snobbishness and their anachronistic class distinctions, and pay more attention to the world and less to their own backyard. Nearly all of them love their country, but they must learn to love it intelligently.""Good advice for everybody, really."
5,Tillie's Influence Far Reaching Indeed!,"""Gleanings from the Wayside"" gives us a further glimpse into the times and to read his observations from a pure artist's standpoint. His influence was far reaching indeed."
2,there are better guides,I swear by Frommer's and this was the first time I was disappointed. My mom bought the Unofficial Guide To WDW 2006 and I borrowed it to compare. The Unofficial Guide is the way to go. This book was a waste of my money. The only thing it has going for it is the size - it's small enough to fit in the diaper bag and take with you to the parks.
5,Must-have book for Disney,"This book was very accurate and had awesome tips about vacationing in Disney. Great tips on rides, age appropriate attractions, best times to visit certain parks, places to stay, dine, etc.... We use it every time we go to Disney and it's a lifesaver."
3,A GOOD SECOND GUIDEBOOK,"While not exhaustive, this book does have more information on what is in the rides (and what might frighten children) than the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World (which I heartily recommend, by the way). This book also has suggested age ranges for the different rides, which makes it easier to determine which rides are age-appropriate. It also has some good information on things to do beyond Disney & Universal. While I have not been to WDW in decades, I can say that the ride reviews for Universal Studios are accurate. This would make a good second guidebook (after the Unofficial Guide) for those wanting a bit more information."
5,The best throat lozenge!,I've used this product on my doctors recommendation for many years now. The Cepacol brand of products is excellent in providing relief for that scratchy throat and sometimes painful burning related to sinus post nasal drip. I highly recommend this product. Unlike most others which contain menthol this product works and the effects last longer than others. Amazon has provided me with a source to obtain the product I need at a price that is very affordable.
2,Numb tongue,"All it did is numb my tongue and it barely helped with my sore throat. I'm seriously disappointed, this was recommended to me by a pharmacologist and I was expecting better result. Even drinking tea had better effect for cheaper.My throat feel a tiny bit better, which is why I don't give this 1 star, but I still feel like wasting money."
1,My mouth is numb...but my throat is still on fire!,"I bought these for a typical sore throat. No other symptoms, just one of those sore throats where it hurts so bad you are dreading your next swallow.I took one lozenge. The lozenge was very effective at numbing whatever portion of my mouth was sucking on it, but provided little relief where it hurt on my throat. I even tried to direct the saliva as I swallowed so the numbing stuff would coat my throat. This was a little more effective, but not by much.Although it did numb the back of my throat a bit, the relief didn't last very long at all. And my mouth now felt icky and gross and numb.I'm sticking with oregano and cayenne, because while those may not take the pain away, they actually work!"
2,Triumph's Last Stand And Musical Downfall,"I am a huge Triumph fan but I have to be quite honest, this is not a very good album. Released less than a year after 1986's ""The Sport Of Kings"", I sense that the band is mere fulfilling a contractual obligation, the band usually releases albums every TWO years. They would break up shortly thereafter.""Surveillance"" is a rather overblown and uninspired effort, with only two really good songs being the straight-ahead rockers ""Long Time Gone"" and ""Rock You Down"". The more progressive numbers never seem to take off. I recommend any other Truimph release before this one and would advise that if you are going to buy a Triumph CD, spend your money wisely on any of them except this one."
2,Not even close to htier best effort,"No wonder Rik Emmett left theband soon after this album. THis is almost a hair metal album, with glossy production and some ""I love you"" lyrics. The only factor that makes this album a little bit enjoyable is that TRIUMPH has such great musicians that even in a lame effort they manage to do some great stuff."
2,cheap product,It does not have a very wide range of filters it will fit and it isn't constructed very well.I have an older one like this that just takes filters off and it works great but I wanted a smaller one.I wish I could find one like my old one.
2,Yawn,"I just spent an excellent long weekend in Lisbon, and this compilation looked like a nice soundtrack to remember my stay by. I secretly hoped that this cd would be as intriguing as Onda Sonora, a cd from the excellent Red&Hot series. However, with a few exceptions, the album is boring. It's Sky Radio music, perfect as background music in supermarkets or subways. A real disappointment is the Copy Control on this CD so that I won't be able to burn the few good songs on my pc."
1,"GIRL I LOVE YA, BUT LETS GET SERIOUS.","Only In My Dreams 1998 is bad. Really bad. Deborah you need to focus on good dance music, like your TOP 40 Billboard Club Play Hit ""Only Words"". Continue with some major possibilities and you will see yourself on top. Furthermore bring that voice down a few octaves, that whining is killing me."
2,DEBORAH FOCUS ON THE FUTURE.,"Deborah Gibson can be a pop queen if she would just give herself the chance. This rehash of the song that made her a teen icon, is past its prime, no matter what help she gets from anyone. Deborah needs to focus on lowering the register of her voice- example ""Losin' Myself"", and stop whining in her songs. Deborah I love you girl, but get into the 90s. I can definitely seeing you as the next POP queen, but you better hurry you are already 28, and time is a-wasting! This single is fair at best."
3,An OK effort,"This tune, which was originally a big hit for Gibson in 1987 was remixed and rerecorded for it's 10 year anniversary. Although overall I find this CD good for intermixing with other dance remixes on Trinidad-Online.org's internet station underwire. Overall I find Jellybeans beats and mixes to be very formulaic and dull. This is more hackneyed 80's dance remix than techno or electronica which is not bad if Gibson wants to milk 80's nostalgia for all it's worth. There is nothing new here."
1,Vinyl not paper...,"We have put borders up in a few rooms in the house with ease - just dip in the water and go. We gave up on this product as both top and bottom edges would not stop curling. We tried more water and we tried less water and nothing worked.I live in an old house with plaster walls but I really don't think that contributed to the problem. I just think that although this is an adorable product, it's not well made. I think it's made from cheap vinyl and unless you're willing to use wallpaper paste (which we weren't) then you shouldn't waste your time purchasing this."
5,My fish love it!,"I feed my fish Microbe Lift wheat germ all through the spring, summer, and fall. They love it and they have grown tremendously. I feed them twice a day and several have quadrupelled in length."
5,Childhood Favorite!!,"I first saw this movie when I was younger, and I absolutely loved it. However, when VHS players died, so did my ability to watch it. I came across this on DVD and I instantly had to have it. Still my favorite live version of Alice in Wonderland. If you haven't seen this, you are missing out!!"
2,Lifeless in Wonderland,The pace of this video is lifeless. It's as if they are doing a walk-thru of the script so that everyone can learn their places. Given the excellent cast this is a crime. Ben Kingsley as the caterpillar has no personality. What a waste to have Whoopi Goldberg do nothing more than grin as the Cheshire Cat - what was the director thinking of. With the talent brought together for this story it should have really clicked instead of just strolling along.
1,i hated hated hated this movie!,I love disney's alice in wonderland and i love the book but i hated this version! What the heck is miranda richardson and gene wilder doing in this? the characters were so annoying especially richardson as the queen of hearts. and the girl who played alice acted like a little snob. do yourself a favor and rent the animated disney classic instead. i wont even waste any more time writing about this!
2,Misses the Point,"I found it very annoying that the makers of this version felt the need to have everyone keep teaching little lessons and reciting little morals to Alice. As another reviewer has said, that is contrary to the whole spirit of the books and contrary to their original intent. (A similar outrage was perpetrated by the makers of the TV movie ""The Odyssey,"" where--contrary to Homer--we see Odysseus having to learn little life lessons before he is allowed to go home.) What I did like, though, was some of the casting, especially Whoopi Goldberg as the Cheshire Cat and Ben Kingsley as the Caterpillar. For those who want a good version of one of the Alices, the one starring Kate Beckinsale is actually rather good. It keeps to the events of ""Through the Looking Glass"" and it has a good absurdist tone."
3,Kind of enjoyable,"This movie is okay if you're in the process of becoming radically stoned. The cast was what attracted me. I enjoy Martin Short and Gene Wilder, their apprearances were amazing. Other than that, this movie is confusing and hard to follow; but, like I said before, this movie is a great compliment to any drug that effects your perception."
5,Alice oh Alice,this is a movie too see and for the whole family and I say go and add it too your collection. .....
2,The worse part about this film is Alice!,"Simply put, the sets are beautiful, the costumes well done, even the low budget special effects are decent. However, Alice is just dull! She speaks in the same tone and has a small assortment of mild facial expressions throughout the whole film. How very disappointing!"
1,Interesting,This is a great comedy\adventure for people with good imaginations. But that isn't my source.
1,"Oh no, no more Alice in Wonderland remakes, please!","The earlier versions of Alice in Wonderland (eg. 1951 cartoon edition) was, well, good. Cheerful. Happy. This 1999 version is at the bottom of the ones I've seen. The only thing that grabs you a bit is Alice shrinking and growing and the walls all changing. But nothing else pretty much amuses me, in fact, everything else is complete dull waste-your-money blogs. Don't watch this version... at least don't buy it. Use this review and instead borrow or rent it. (Get the earlier ones)"
3,It's Worth the Time,"Well, certain elements of the book are missing. Nevertheless, this is a delightful way to spend a lazy afternoon. The scenery is beautiful and the effects are done well; the characters (especially Short, Wilder, and Ustinov) are convincing. Even though the movie does get silly at times, it is never boring. Even if you never read the book, you should watch this. You may be pleasantly surprised."
2,Re: A Viewer from Pennsylvania 6/23/99,"I am also an Alice collector and I agree with you wholeheartedly except for one thing. An amazing version of Alice in Wonderland DOES exist...""Alice"" by Jan Svankmajer (1988). It's not 100% accurate to the book, but it captures the madness beautifully. The two stars I've given this TV version are for the nice visuals in some scenes."
5,My personal favorite Alice,"Lovelovelove this movie! I'll admit, I've never read the books, but my friends that have say it is pretty accurate, particularly when she is in Wonderland. I love that Alice is a brunette, and actually a child. She's pretty, but in a very simple and natural way, as a child should be. Most of the characters are very charming. I especially like the man outside the dutchess' house, the white knight, and the Jack of Hearts [he's so funny!!] The queen is a little irritating with her squealing, and I hate Whoopi Goldberg as the cheshire cat. The Dutchess is pretty funny, after the scene in her house. The caterpillar scene is AWESOME. Particularly for those of us who indulge in mind-altering substances from time to time.."
4,ALICE IN WONDERLAND!,"After having great success with lavish productions of ""Merlin"" and ""The Odyssey,"" NBC followed up with this ambitious adaptation of the Lewis Carroll classic! Tina Majorino stars as Alice with one of those star-studded casts we have come to expect when Hollywood visits Wonderland (remember Gary Cooper as the White Knight or the Smothers Brothers as Tweedledum and Tweedledee?)! This time around we have Whoppi Goldberg as the Chesire Cat, Martin Short as the Mad Hatter, Christopher Lloyd as the White Knight, Ben Kingsley as the Caterpiller and Miranda Richardson as the Red Queen! This is a fairly faithful adaptation of the beloved book and the framing device is simply a chance to give the cast a curtain call! Nothing wrong with that! They can remake ""Alice in Wonderland"" every decade as far as I am concerned!"
2,Letdown by Hallmark,"Hallmark Entertainment has made many movies from children's books, and this probably one of the worst. Based on both ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" this movie stars many of the familiar faces of Hallmark movies and children's movies, such as Gene Wilder, Miranda Richardson, Martin Short, and Whoopi Goldberg. The lead character of Alice is unfortunately played by an actress that is not so good. The movie revolves around her, and she seems to move from one scene to the next with little emotion or expression. Even the crying scenes seemed fake. Where is Dakota Fanning when you need her? The cinematography, costume and set design are spot on, as usual for Hallmark movies, but the soundtrack was unnoticeable. The only bright spot was the engaging song by Gene Wilder's character. All in all, quite boring."
2,"Indeed, you can wreck a masterpiece.","If you hold dear the book, the Disney version, or even the 1985 Alice (with Carol Channing!), steer clear of this movie.Whereas the original storyline is deliciously impish, cheeky, convoluted, and whimsical -- this version is lackluster and flat, with two-dimensional characters and lackluster scenery, encapsulated in a blandly innocent approach. The amazing Gene Wilder and Whoopi Goldberg are its main saving grace.All I can say is... imagine if Hallmark made a version of Alice in Wonderland.Oh wait, it did."
3,A rather dull movie........,"I expected it to be really fun. It was kind of difficult to understand. I think the cookie and mushroom parts were little bit interesting. But, the race? It was rather stupid. I mean, there's people running all around the 'room' and there's no end, no beginning. It's kind of funny where the Queen keeps on shouting, ""OFFF WITH HER HEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" Alice was a so-so person.I think adults would like this movie. It was rather dull and uninteresting in some parts, especially the race. After you finish, it leaves an dull space in your stomach. Other movies with Woopi Goldberg such as ""Cinderella"" is much more fun. I mean, she just grins,grins, and grins as the Chester Cat."
4,"It was great, but you have pay attention understand it.","Alice in Wonderland has been made into countless movies. This latest version is very nicely done with great effects and colorful characters. The Movie was alittle hard to follow though. The movie really combines the characters of Alice in Wonderland and the characters of Through the Looking Glass, a continuation of Alices adventures in Wonderland. Over all, I feel that the movie was very intertaining and perfect for watching over a spot of tea. I should know I was in it! MadHattr79"
5,A modernized version,"This movie is a modernized version of an old classic. It has great special effects,and has a cast of very imaginitive actors,(robin williams would have been great in this movie). The storyline remains true to the original,and all in all it is just an extremely fun movie to watch. If you are looking for an entertaining movie that you can watch with your children,then this is it."
3,ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS 1932,THIS WAS OK BUT WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND WITH ON SUCCESS IS THE 1932 VERSION. IT IS THE BEST!!! IF ANYONE SHOULD KNOW WHERE I COULD GET IT PLEASE PLEASE LET ME KNOW.END
5,The Best Yet!,"I think this is the best yet rendition of this story. According to the Director this is the first time it has been shown as it was written. Martin Short plays the Mad Hatter, Whoopi Goldberg plays the Cheshire Cat and The Queen of Hearts is excellent in her ""off with her head!"" It was aired on TV in Feb. 99. I can't wait to get my copy!"
1,Slow & Boring,This is one of those movies that really throws you for a loop; most fantasy movies don't have anywhere near this stunning or detailed sets and effects. Some of the costumes and props were very nice as well.I think they should have spent some money on a writer though. And it is very slow paced; I could barely sit and watch the whole thing so I doubt most children will.Despite the big name cast no one really delivers any kind of memorable performance. Miranda Richardson spends most of her scenes doing an impression of Madeline Khan's trademark whine that got old fast. I actually felt sorry for Gene Wilder; why he felt the need to do this compared to what he usually does...the rest of the musical numbers weren't much any better.It has it's moments but unless you really want to watch you shouldn't bother with this version.
2,Unfortunately disappointing.....,"I had seen this version when it was shown on television last year. Despite a very talented cast and some very top notch special effects for a made for television movie, there were too many changes to the story that left me feeling terribly hollow afterwards. I don't know why the production team had to make such a drastic change to the beginning of the story. The fact they had to change the opening from Alice's sister reading to her to Alice preparing to sing for some recital just didn't set well with me. The girl they chose to play Alice did an exceptional job despite the weak script and one of highlights in the movie for me was Gene Wilder as the Mock Turtle. It was so nice to see him on the screen again after such a long time. I just hope in the future if Hollywood wants to do a production like this, they will stay true to the original story."
4,Review by GuT,Was a very good movie for how cheap it is...I bought off the market place sellers and was very impressed with how fast the shipment was....Any fan of Alice will like......A must have DVD for your collection.....
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"I don't know what everyone here is talking about. The movie was a real let down in every aspect of the word. The screenplay was awful, the editing was to quick and confusing. The direction led the actors astray from the film. At times the actors appearded to be thinking to themselves,""Why did I ever agree to do this movie?"". And the acting just stunk more than a garbage heep on a hot summer day. It was just an all around flop. I sat there the whole time wishing for it to be over. It was that bad. If you like lame made-for-tv movies that lack in acting and directing. Than by all means this is for you. But if you love movies and actually care about how your movies flow, than don't get this, please! Get the Disney cartoon version. That at least had better acting in it! Doh!"
1,bLECH,"This is one of the worst 'Alice' adaptations yet. Not only has it been overtly Americanized (aka dumbed down) but it pays absolutely no respect to the Lewis Carroll text.An 'Alice' afficionado, I like the 1968 BBC version with music by Ravi Shankar. It's thrilling, dreamy, and terribly clever and original."
3,Alic In Wonderland DVD,"This DVD will not play in my Bose DVD player. It says it's a 'bad disc', so I'm a bit dissapointed that we cannot watch it through the TV"
2,Misses the Point,"I found it very annoying that the makers of this version felt the need to have everyone keep teaching little lessons and reciting little morals to Alice. As another reviewer has said, that is contrary to the whole spirit of the books and contrary to their original intent. (A similar outrage was perpetrated by the makers of the TV movie ""The Odyssey,"" where--contrary to Homer--we see Odysseus having to learn little life lessons before he is allowed to go home.) What I did like, though, was some of the casting, especially Whoopi Goldberg as the Cheshire Cat and Ben Kingsley as the Caterpillar. For those who want a good version of one of the Alices, the one starring Kate Beckinsale is actually rather good. It keeps to the events of ""Through the Looking Glass"" and it has a good absurdist tone. (Original review April 2007)"
3,What Happened Michael?,"Sadly, over the course of the years, I think Michael Tomlinson ran out of things to sing about - every single song on this album sounds the same and is full of forced, tired lyrics. It is a huge dissapoint to me, because I discovered Michael on an Alaskan radio station one night in 1986 on the way down the Knik Arm, heading through the darkness to a single house up ahead in the distance where I was meeting friends. The song ""Yellow Windows"" came on just as I turned the corner to see the warmth of the lights inside the house beckoning to me as smoke swirled up from the chimney into the chilly Alaskan night. Where did songs like that go? Not since ""Living Things"" (and a few on that album could be tossed out) has Michael done anything daring musically or lyrically like he did on ""Waves"" from ""Run This Way Forever"".My advice to Michael - go back to the wild for 3 months, camp out under the stars, clear your head, and give us something you like you did back in the 80's"
1,puppy music,"I thoroughly enjoyed the earlier MT work ""Face up in the Rain"" and expected an even more mature and complex work in this offering. I was sadly disappointed. The entire work is in a single bouncy, happy, tiresome tempo with lyrics that I'd expect from a youngster like Jewel. It's going in the ""to be sold"" stack. I'll keep ""Face Up..."""
5,retro,"i usually never looked at the recommendations on this site, but recently i started out of curiousity checking them out. i came across this, listened to one clip, and bought it right then and there. i'd recommend this for anyone who is sick of the way modern rock'n'roll has gone. this has got that british-invasion bluesy feel to it with a touch of the late 60s early 70s country-style farm boy rock. modern take on retro styles complete with hammond organ. up-beat, throw it in on a drive."
3,The Blue Van,"The CD is pretty good, though some are better than others on the CD. The only song that makes the CD worth wild is the one from Royal Pains."
4,It is great but not handy,"I bought this to make chinese noodle. I use it nearly every month. It is small, convinent to use. However, it is hard to find a place to fasten it when use. If not fasten well, it will move around in using. I just fasten it to a thick wooden board and it works."
2,Not what I hoped for,"While I'm sure it's a perfectly fine pasta roller, it is completely unadjustable and therefore unsuited to my needs. If you want a machine that will roll dough or clay to varying thicknesses, look elsewhere."
3,Does its job,It does its job...probably not for long! It's made from cheap material. The metal covers are thin and can get dented easily. The handle can fall off easily. The cover on the size selector dial doesn't even fit!
4,Before you become a marketer...,"This has to be the first book you read about marketing. A prolific chartered marketer and lecturer, Philip Kotler is one is the best known figures in the art and science of marketing. If you can't afford to attend one of his insightful seminars, this book is the second best thing. Together with Gary Armstrong, he has written this bible that every marketing student and teacher should read. Even if you are a seasoned practioner, reading this book can only let you gain more insight. In this latest (millennium) edition, colour photographs, numerous case studies, as well as an interactive CD-ROM with quizzes make this textbook an interesting and easy read. Furthermore, exercises and summaries at the end of each chapter actually make learning marketing concepts fun and enjoyable. Whether you are a beginner or a veteran of marketing, this is a great book not to be ignored."
5,"Muy contenta con el libro de Kotler que compré, en perfecto estado y muy económico","Todo estaba en perfectas condiciones tanto el libro como el CD y muy económico. Tardó en llegarme a casa un par de semanas más o menos, venía de EE.UU y el comerciante que me vendió el libro me envió un email para que contactara con ellos si había algún error o el pedido se demoraba más de lo previsto.Como os cuento todo perfecto.Saludos,Lucía."
4,Good mic,"I havent used my mic for a while, but when I have, it's been fairly good. The biggest issue I have with it is the headband- I wish it didnt hurt so much! And it does interefere with my glasses at times... so taking it off and putting it on all the time can be a pain. As for performance, well, on Tour (i drive a tour bus and narrate at the same time) it has a very good sound to it, and the microphone doesnt feel like it's in the way (its actually sort of comfortable if you get the head strap on right).Honestly, the worst thing about this mic is the head band since it's metal and pokes a lot. Thats the reason for 4 stars. Other than that, I couldnt reccomend another!"
4,Jazzercise Instructor,"VERY sturdy and durable. Replaced twice in 8 years, minimum 5 one hour classss a week. Shure mic systems are excellent!"
3,Life Like Dolls - A Critique,"As a doll collector myself, I had good motivation to buy and read this book. The area of focus, however, is on baby, or child like dolls, and I have little interest in these. As it was published in 2004, I was expecting more about fashion and icon dolls, but there was almost nothing. The author also concentrated his efforts on what he referred to as PCDs, meaning porcelain doll collectors. There are many other mediums available and currently in use in the manufacture of collector dolls, which makes them more durable and more versatile, but this was barely mentioned.It seemed like this book was written by someone or persons who had no personal appreciation of doll collecting, and the material seems dated. I would have liked to see pictures and interviews with collectors, maybe even a chapter on designers.The author made vague illusions to fear of dolls, but otherwise, the information within the book was informative, and did seem accurate, albeit, somewhat dated."
3,Impressionist Fiction (with can can dancers!),"""Parisian Sketches"" is worth the paperback cost simply for the chapter that spends a few pages discussing the various erotic odors emanating from the underarms of Parisian grisettes. This is a valuable historical document: I hope it never goes out of print."
2,show sucks,"I am a fan of the original five-0 and this show is a joke to the standards of the old show of the 1970's. The old series had no lingering story lines but for Wo Fat, each episode was a stand alone gem. The men of Five-o dressed in suits and were classy, these new guys dress like bums, like they just walked into a bar on a Friday night. The musical score in the new series is loud, over the top and often just out of place with the content of the scenes. The editing is fast in your face, made for a child with ADD. The actors all look pretty much the same, no great character distinctions here. This new show is just bad."
3,"Too much exposition, but still niiice.","Ok, just glad the blonde chick on the team is gone. Now we can get back to what made season 1 kick ass. This episode was slow, though. Too much time dealing with background explanation. Not enough action. This is an action show. We need what made season 1 so damn good. The formula is disintegrating at the roots for season 2. Not enough vision in my opinion. But, the bickering between Steve and Danno...ahhhhh, good to have that back, though in this ep. there wasn't near enough. I've stopped watching the show because of the blonde. Just waiting for her to get written out. It seems that's happened, so, I'm back, but was bored with this ep. I'm going to go check out the others. To the writers, producers...get your game back on track. If you have to re-watch season 1 to do it, then by all means, do SOMETHING."
2,It's going downhill fast,"I enjoyed Season One but am hugely disappointed that the writers have chosen to depart from the ""one crime - solve it"" per episode in favor of an ongoing story line or theme. The characters that had started off in Season One as a united family, occasional fun and humorous story lines have degenerated into dark, brooding characters and story lines. Are the writers afraid if one of the characters smiles it will ruin the story??? If there is a Season Three, I sincerely hope they return to the old format. I don't want one theme or mystery running through an entire season and carrying over into the next season. I want to see a crime drama that has a story and then wraps everything up in one episode."
4,Enjoyed with anticipation,It's great to see Five O' under fire and on fire in this episode. Wo Fat is programmed and is hard to beat and will he be caught?
2,Won't Be Buying Season Two,"While I own & love the first season of Hawaii 5-0, I will not be purchasing Season Two. The fun and camaraderie of Season One was destroyed with slipshod writing and the introduction of the useless character of Lori Weston. Where I used to look forward to Monday nights to get my 5-0 fix, now I DVR the show and fast-forward through all the scenes that feature Lori. It's a shame, as I had initially planned to own all seasons as soon as they became available. Am sincerely hoping the writers do away with the Weston character in Season Three, and that the show regains its former greatness."
4,Great quality,The video was exceptional and easy to load to my Kindle Fire. Amazon has newly aired episodes available for many series.
2,Video Quality is Extremely Poor,"Admittedly I did not purchase the HD version, but there are spots in this video that come out exceptionally poor even accounting for it being non-HD. Almost grainy, in fact. This happens on and off, and is particularly distracting when it occurs during close ups of the characters' expressions.Otherwise, a decent episode. Glad to see more of Kono!!"
5,Great 2nd Season,"This season was way better than the First one, really enjoyed. The storyline flowerld perfectly and the chemistry between the charactares is amazing."
5,Hawaii Five-O,Hawaii Five-O second season dvd is excellent. Love the show and We watch it every week. Enjoy re-watching on dvd.
4,Overall I enjoyed the season 5,"I enjoyed it for sure but I have to return disc 5 because it is defective. Do I have to send back the entire set or can I replace just disc 5.Also, I plan to order season 3Thanks"
5,Love It,"Hawaii 5-0 is without a doubt the best show on TV in a very long time. It has perfect casting, great drama, exciting action and wonderful comedy not to mention the most incredible back ground ever. The chemistry between the four team members is alway exiting. There is always a new storyline with the underlying backstory of McGarrett and WoFat. I think it is just the best and anxiously await the Season Two DVD. Now we know there will be a season three which is great too."
3,Bring Back Kono!!!,"Is it just me, or are they trying to attract more viewers by replacing Kono? I can't figure out if they're trying to appeal to more guys by adding a ""sexy lady"" type or trying to appeal to girls by putting in a love interest for McGarrett.Either way, I don't like it. It's just too obvious a retool for ratings. Plus, it means a thin Kono story line, and I love Kono (even if she's too skinny to be legit surfer girl!). Also, I didn't much like the shows usage of Seal Team 9 here. It felt like they were taking advantage of the Team's popularity for a ratings grab as well.Other than that, typically Hawaii Five-0: Lots of action, the occasional gaping plot hole or unreasonably illegal police acts, but fun all the same. Plus, you get to see some gorgeous shots of Hawaii."
1,Hot Hawaiian Mess,"There were so many things wrong with this episode, I don't even know where to begin. First, it was hyped as the Hawaii Five-O wedding. The scenes used in those promos were no where to be seen, and the much hyped wedding lasted just under 2 minutes.Second, too much story and not enough space to go through it. It left me kind of confused, and feeling unresolved. It also cut down the amount of time spent with real character interactions, and really I watch this show for the chemistry between the cast... so definitely bit into my enjoyment of the show.Third, that Lori person. Still don't like her, still don't understand why she's in the show (other than as obvious eye candy). I wish they'd write her out.All in all, probably the worst Five-0 episode I've seen to date."
2,Crappy Quality,"I first bought season 2 of Hawaii 5-0 from this company, then proceeded to contact them about the quality of picture. They sent me another copy of the disc with the same quality. Definitely not as high end quality as my season 1 is, which I bought brand new."
5,For my daughter,I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter who lives and breathes for this show.She tells me it is absolutely wonderful.
5,Wonderful!,"Everything I thought it would be, exciting and interesting. I love the series, and I keep watching whenever I need to refresh my memory."
3,good show,"Other than having a problem with flash player on my Mac, the video played great on my office PC. About 2 weeks later Amazon sent me a email notifying me to upgrade my flash player on my Mac. I will hesitate in the future about buying shows from Amazon. Hawaii Five-O is a favorite show so I'll make sure to watch it live."
5,Best Stunt Ever!,"I bought this episode purely for the skydiving stunt it contains. Best skydiving stunt ever on TV! When the bad guy pushes the unconcious victim from the plane, McGarrett appears seemingly out of nowhere, catches the victim, tries to attach to him, loses him, then catches up to him again (all the time falling, of course), hooks up and lands like a pro: he's a SEAL, ya know. The victim is saved and Supersteve prevails once again!"
4,Thought I was getting a good deal.,"The price was right, and the Rhoda stories are good. However, I didn't realize I was only getting 5 shows on the DVD. I guess I needed to read those details in the description."
4,Surprised.,"As another reviewer said, I was very surprised to find only six episodes on the DVD. And yes, I should have paid more attention to the details. However, the fact that the cover is the same as the Season One cover in practically all aspects IS misleading. As for the shows themselves, well, I love Rhoda, and it was great to see these episodes again."
4,Loved it but the size.....,"This book is beautifully written with wonderful pictures, but I didn't pay attention to the size before purchasing. The size of it makes it nearly impossible to use in a classroom setting if reading to a large group."
4,Overview of Day of the Dead,"This book shares the customs and traditions observed in the celebration of Day of the Dead across Latin-America. Descriptions of preparations and their purposes explain their significance and symbolism. Good information, interesting illustration."
3,Good but not great,"Interesting for reading to 1 or 2 children but way to small to read to my class. Is kid-friendly and colorful, just not very practical due to size."
3,I watched it for the James Brown sequences,ok film makers of Soul Power please do yourselves a favor and just make a James Brown film with all the footage of him on stage and off stage Im not sure if that was in the deleted sequences but all the footage with the sound is so A+ that is a film that needs to be by itself. Granted Soul Power was made and set out for what its purpose was. But this James film alone needs to be made.please make the film with all the footage that was filmed.
2,Not able to watch it,Unlike other DVDs bought at amazon... The DVD player in Colombia wouldn't let me watch this one because of the zone...
1,Soul Power,"Only reason I watched it was For Celia Cruz and James Brown, And of course you have Ali Running his mouth off as usual with his 5%er views and you B.B. King, Other than That I don't care What Miriam Makeba has to say it about colonies etc.Nor Do I care for The BLACK FASCISM Movement,NOI,Panthers,Etc. That Africa was and Still needs Help is no one's fault, Why not Have Belgium and France and The EU handle it? Instead We send money and Aid over to People who Sadly will never make it, And Black Americans certainly can't Criticize as they are only able to throw ""Concerts"" and ""Festivals"" or Get back to Afro-Centric Roots(Roots that Have laid Dormant for Most for over 400Years) Unless your Parents are Literally From Africa. That's not to say this will not appeal to the Bleeding Heart Save the World Liberal or The Radical.James Brown & Celia Rock! Hate on Player."
5,enjoyable read,"If you are interested in this sort of thing, it is a really enjoyable read with plenty of illustrations. It is the story of the people who built and lived in Wilderstein, and the story of the house itself. If you like to learn about the history and background of the amazing mansions along the Hudson, it is indispensible."
5,cider candy,"great candy! good dealer, but a little overpriced on shipping (with those prices, they should overnite it!)"
1,revueing the revue from Japan,"I have played darts with and against Paul Lim in competition. He is very good and a many time world champion. In reading the revue from japan, I was disappointed for I expected much more of and instructional video on throwing darts and not an introduction to darts and it's history. There are good instructional dart videos out there somewhere but I am having a hard time finding them.I will not purchase the video because I am looking for an instructional video from the pros on improving my accuracy, proper delivery and proper release of the dart.I appreciate your revue from the viewer in Japan. If I could have read the cover and browsed through the Book I would not have purchased it anyway.Thank YouMurel Kee"
2,Good for beginner,"We thought first part of video boring. It explains history ofdarts. Then, it shows a couple of beginner throwing darts. This is a good part. Because it illustrates how new people tend to throw. We wanted to see more of game strategy and how you should play to win."
3,So-So Maxi-Single,"This CD doesn't really compare to Madonna's other maxi-singles. There are only four tracks. The first is the album version of the title-track. The second is a trippy remix by William Orbit, which, at first I really disliked, but give it a chance and it may grow on you (I love it now). The third song is a live version of ""Why's It So Hard?"" from The Girlie Show. This song isn't very good anyways, and the live version doesn't do much (although you do hear some humorous moaning in the beginning). The last track is another Orbit mix of ""I'll Remember."" It's *very* similar to the original version and you need to have a keen ear to hear the differences."
3,Retractable gel pens are far better,"They are nice, to be roller ball pens, for they have a nice writing. However I rather pay a bit more to have the smoothness of a gel ink pen."
5,"Well then, color me amazed.","I actually got two of these as inclusion pens in two 5 packs of Uniball Visions. I've always been a fan of the Vision pens, but, oh my, these Jetstreams are just amazing. A very smooth write, the grips are perfectly comfortable, the quality of ink is top notch for a disposable pen. I would have to say, without question, these pens are the very best daily writers I've come across. Sure, they're a bit on the pricey side, however, I deem them worthy of every extra cent. Cheers to Uniball for making a great writing device."
5,Been buying these pens for years,"These are my favorite pens. The pen smoothy glides over the paper, letting me write as rapidly as I please without ever experiencing that horrible ""scratchy"" feeling you get with some (even other ballpoint) pens. The ink dries rapidly, meaning there's no smearing. This is especially important if you hold your pen improperly with your hand in contact with the paper. The pens have pop-off caps, which are less convenient than clicky pens, but there's no risk of the ink staining your clothes when you carry a pen in your pocket. The pens have a bit of heft of them, too."
2,"Good quality, but don't buy from amazon","Ink ran out after 10 min of use in all 4 pens that I bought from Amazon less than a month ago. I hate it when Amazon does this to other products as well, (printing books on inferior paper) and puts up a charade that it's selling authentic items for less. Really disappointed as you can tell.The pens themselves are good quality but even if the ink didn't run out...I don't see what all the excitement is about. Other Uniball pens and Pilot G2s are so much better than these pens. Because of an excellent build quality they feel heavy after a while."
2,I'm not impressed,"This pen is supposed to draw a bold line yet the line it draws is thin and weak. What is 1.0mm supposed to mean anyway? The Gel Impact with the 1.0mm point produces a thicker line that is closer to 1.0mm width than this pen. The Vision Elite 0.8mm draws a thicker, darker line than the 1.0mm Jetstream."
4,Fine way to start grilling with mesquite,"If you've never had the pleasure of grilling with mesquite, this is the product for you. As an introduction to the joys of the Texas border wood, this charcoal companion will make a profound difference in the flavor of your favorite meats and vegetables.But for enthusiasts of mesquite, this will be a frustrating approach. If you really start to appreciate the flavor of mesquite, eventually you'll want to take the trouble to find a supplier of cut chords of mesquite to cook solely with that long-burning wood. Mixing with charcoal may well be more economical, but it imparts a 'confused' flavor to food which, while still tasty, is nowhere near as powerful as cooking on mesquite alone."
2,Bean pods are the only way to go,"""Tropic"" made some good points about using wood/charcoal, but I have to reintegrate the comments about bean pods. They are easier to use, produce smoke more reliably without the difficulty of re-hydration you have with any type of wood and produce a sweeter, better flavor every time. Add to that the fact that using them is better for the environment (regardless of what the wood sellers say) and you can't do better than beans. Using then in a gas grill is a breeze. By he way, all the old-timers have known about using beans for eternity. I have just a few trees on my property and it takes me just a few hours to collect a years worth of beans and I grill a lot."
5,It's so soft!!!!!,"Excellent value, beautiful color, and so much softer than most of the rugs I came across while shopping, even the more expensive ones. Exactly what I wanted."
3,big rug,"wasnt as nice as i thought it would be as it stated original price was 399.00 i found that hard to believe, i dont know if i would have bought the rug if it were in the store for even 100.00 wasnt all that nice"
4,Just What I was looking for,This product was just what i was looking for. I bought it mostly for the adapter so i could connect my laptops sound card to my sound system at home. It works great and it has the best sound quality i have ever had from my home theater system.
1,"Good cable, but big problem with adapter","Nice cable, but there are two problems with the adapter: 1) it is made with paper thin metal and therefore very fragile. Mine broke just by accidentally slightly bending the cable while it was plugged in. 2) It sticks straight out of the side of the computer which makes it easy to accidentally bend the cable and also makes it harder to put into narrow spaces (e.g., entertainment cabinet). I bought a different adapter that had a 90 degree bend in it - it has worked great and corrected the two problems stated above."
4,Early Post Punk,"Kirk Brandon, the singer of Theatre of Hate and Spear of Destiny made his start in The Pack. The sound is very raw and the lyrics are political. If you've never heard them, some of the good songs are Brave New Soldiers, King of Kings, Abbatoir, and Thalidomide. Many of the songs on this CD are demos, as the band only released 3 proper singles and a live cassette that is now impossible to find. Half of the songs are released here for the very first time. Fans of Theatre of Hate will love the early demo of Legion, although it is very unrefined. The CD also features a few videos of the band that can be played on your computer. Hopefully a second Pack CD will be released, featuring some of the tracks not on this CD: Death to Life, Pack of Lies, and British Justice."
3,A Better Title for a Good Book,This is a resource for a salesman with a few years in the field. The proper title should be
2,Completely unfocused,"Although there were helpful closing techniques within this book. It was completely unfocused. Instead of concentrating on the best closing techniques, it presented every possible closing technique possible and gives no direction to the reader as to which ones to choose. I'm surprised this book has sold so many copies."
1,Poor Quality,"When I opened it at home I discovered that one of the animals was chipped. I should have returned it, but didn't have the time. Inspect it carefully before you buy it."
1,Kill The Messenger,McCormick is nothing like the book says it is. My dad grew up in that small town and everybody knows everybody. It's a small friendly town. Fortenberry is a journalist that doesn't have anything better to do than ruin pople's lives. He even wanted to make a movie out of the book. I just wanted to say that this book portrays the small town of McCormick as a town that is still in the civil war and that is divided. The book is nothing like real life!
4,Beginning Acting,"Using this textbook for my beginning acting class over the summer. Not much to read, which is good and bad at the same time. Good perspectives but not enough to want to keep this book after the class is over."
5,"Old Book, Great Condition","The book itself is a little outdated, but works for my class all the same. It was in pretty solid condition when I received it."
3,If only they finished it...,"I have watched a wide variety of Anime, and I have to say that this is a fun series. I was very dissapointed however, in finding out that it was never finished the way it was intended. Because of a fund shortage, the company responsible for it cut it way short (only 6 episodes?) and had to finish it.I enjoyed what I did see, but it honestly comes down to what sparks your interest. I recommend highly that you watch this anime, but not necessarily buy it. Like evangaleon, those who hunt elves, and many other anime that were never finished as intended, watch, but purchase on your own accord. If you want to see them borrow them from a friend, but none the less watch them."
3,It's ok,"t's certainly not one of my favorites, but it wasn't too bad either. I watched the whole series once and that was plenty for me."
1,Bad experience,I never received this product. I emailed the sender and they have not responded. I have not been credited back the money either.
4,I don't know why but we all like it.,"Bastard is about a dark wizard called Dark Schneider. He is an arrogant, mega super ultra jackass and pervert, but the only one that can save Meta-Rikana, and hook up with the hot priestess. It's an older title so don't expect crazy awesome CG or anything. The saving grace of this series is the abundance of hard core characters. The best part of this series are the awesome enemies Schneider has to kill. There is a lot of violence and nudity. So it's not for kids. It'd probably screw them up in the head. I'm not sure why I like it, but I do. You may enjoy it too."
5,One of my favorite anime series,"Bastard!! You gotta love just yelling it out like that. This was one of my favorite anime series as short as it is, not that short is a bad thing especially when it is this enjoyable. The cocky Dark Schneider is even today one of my all-time favorite characters in anime. The humor and storyline are epic and the artistry of the series was awesome in its day. This is a must have for serious anime collectors and as a side note; good luck in your pursuit for a new copy. These are no longer in production as far as I know so when you can get one new... why are you still reading this?... order one already!!"
5,Bastard!!-Complete Collection,"I really enjoyed this comical series. I went on this site tosee if there was anymore to the series and was disappointed thatthere wasn't. I hope that they finish up the series, I can'twait to find out what happens next. I can't seem to get enoughof the main charactor! I was laughing so hard... it left me intears."
4,Bastard,"Bastard is an action-based story about the legendary sorcerer, Darsh Schneider. Darsh,even though he is characterized as a villain- -since the story opens with him being resurrected after a failed attempt to rule the world, he really isn't a bastard at all. The plot is fair and there are a couple of really funny scenes- -Darsh has a habit of taking off his clothes. I suggest this anime, and others like Sorcerer Hunters, Fushigi Yugi, Tenchi Muyo, etc. if you like humorous anime with a twist."
5,outstanding animation and comedy,"If you can handle reading subtitles, I recommend the japanese version over the translation. Dark Schneider is the great hero with a dark sense of humour whose casual manner and overconfidence brings much entertainment to the apocalyptic storyline. This movie has it all, love, laughter, combat, intrigue.. a must see!"
1,Army of Darkness is better!!!!!!!,"I really didn't like this anime. It contains lots of stupid jokes, graphics not so good, so so fights and a ridiculous story. The only ""good"" things are the animation and blood and gore but they are not THAT good.This is more like a fantasy comedy, if you like RPG games then maybe you will like this short serie but only if you can tolerate silly dialoges and ""machismo"".In my opinion this anime is pretty much like Army of Darkness. Now that movie makes me laught!!I just think that anime don't fit with this silly ""macho"" stuffs, specially when the story is about fantasy. Anime is not THAT good with jokes so I preffer to watch the American movies if Im gonna laught with action.Adios."
5,Bastard anime,"Not being a big anime fan, I totally loved this one. It is more comedy than anything else. DS is so arrogant that it makes it great."
5,Jimminy Jilikers this is Good Stuff!,"Exellent anime. Superb visuals, exellent storyline, cool and original characters, great fighting scenes, laugh out loud splashes of comedy thrown in at just the right times, exellent price (27 bucks for 3, 1hr long, VHS tapes). Typically i'm pretty hard to please but I just can't find anything wrong with this anime.One thing: be sure you watch them in the right order, mine didn't come in the right order in the box and my friend put in the last tape first. =P No, not ALL my friends are that dumb."
4,I once wrote a paper on the antihero,"With Lina Inverse being the perfect example (doing justice only because she may have a chance to fill her pocket and her stomach), this guy is a close second. He hasn't very clear reasons why he wishes to save the nearby town, but he fights against his own former allies just for the heck of it."
2,Okay the truth,"The anime is not that great. I think the story plot was good and I loved the fact that Darsh did not kill his old friends. But what about the ending, it def left room for more series. What will happen to the city? What about all the characters?The nudity and sexual content is ridiculous and should have been left for something else.I would have liked to sat down and watched the movie with other people but with the sexual content I didn't want too. They would have thought I was a perv.I hate the fact that the girls were always scantily clad even the high priestess certainly the nudity was not needed."
5,Get this movie!,Kewl stuff. Lot's of action sequence and some little skin. Good animation. A definite must see.
4,My daughter loves it!,My daughter has all of the Ty Backyardigans. She loves them all. They are durable and wash well. She takes them everywhere.
4,very bright,"I found Tyrone, Uniqua and Pablo in a store and needed to get Tasha and Austin to complete the set for my 1 year old. When they came i was sad that i hadn't ordered all 5 online. The ones from the store were faded and more expensive than the ones i received from online. Tasha and Austin's colors are really bright and i paid about 1/2 the price i had paid for the other ones each (free shipping deal). The ones from amazon were in zippered packages and were shipped very fast. Very satisfied with my online purchase."
1,Do NOT BUY this product.,"I have never written a good or bad review on a product I have purchased. With that said, I wanted to write a review on this product b/c I am beyond disappointed with this product. I understand this would not have the sound quality of the regular piano..However, the sound quality is beyond poor. It it extremely off-tune. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!! I paid $100 for this worthless product, and upset that I should've listened to other reviewers. I am trying to figure out how I can return this product that we got for our 3 year old daughter for Christmas. :( Plus, this product states age 3 and up... Not sure how.. My daughter is 39 inches tall, and already too big for this product."
3,Beautiful piece - horrible sound,"My husband and I were looking at a number of different kid size pianos for our ""Santa"" gift for our 2.5 yr old. She loves here little digital Casio keyboard and her Grandma's big piano. Since we want to capitalize on her love of music and get her going, we wanted to get a piano. This is beautifully made and super solid. Unfortunately, we did not understand that it was not going to sound anything like a piano. It sounds clangy and chimy since it is a plastic hammer hitting a thin metal rod. We made the mistake of waiting until Xmas Eve to put it together and try it. Had we more intelligently done it sooner, we would have returned it and spent half the money on the digital one with karaoke mike. Our daughter bangs on it periodically but is not as excited about it as the digital we hoped to say goodbye to and other pianos she's been around."
2,Disappointed,"The piano was arrived on time. Very easy to assemble. However, it doesn't make any noise when I received it. The kid and I were all very disappointed. The way to pack this kind of vulnerble product needs to be improved obviously."
3,Definitley not for older children,"We bought this for my daughter who just turned 4 at Christmas, the piano is extremely little for her. Another year it really will be to small. Though I didn't expect it to sound great (or like our real piano). I was somewhat dissappointed in the sound, not really sure I would purchase again. However, it is extremely cute but if you just want something to bang on and play around than this is what you want, otherwise skip."
5,one of the best xmas gift,my girl loves it so much and it act like a real piano for toddler. one of the best xmas gift for kids.
5,What Wonderful Insight to Have...,Learning the meaning behind the poem shows a new light on it and goes to show that God does work in miraculous ways. Margaret Fishbone Powers' story is remarkable and she truly is deserving of the credit for the poem.
5,"Wow, Volcanoes Rock Here!!","Microsoft keeps putting out educational software that rocks for kids. As a teacher, regular and special education, I welcome every issue Microsoft tackles. For several reasons. I know it's gonna be good. Educational. Compelling. Enjoying....As a parent of a seven year old, I know what good software can mean to a child. Microsoft knows, too.

5,A nice introduction,"If St. John Maximovich is your patron saint or you wish to learn more about his life, this book will be of interest. The best part of the book is the photographs and the design. It is a labor of love in that respect.The text (seven homilies) is a bit thin. I would have liked more information about his life and more testimonials from his spiritual children, like the Fr. Arseny book, rather than so many details about his incorrupt state. It's a nice introduction, however, and will motivate you to learn more about his life and seek St. John's intercessions."
