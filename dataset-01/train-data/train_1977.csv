3,This one is weaker than most of the books in the series,"Robert B. Parker as always provides crisp and interesting dialogue and once in a while, laugh out loud humor.However, the plot seems cobbled together using disparate elements from an Enron-like business scandle, an unlikely sex club and one really evil guy.For Spenser fans, the humor and dialogue are worth the price of the book. I agree that newcomers to the series will enjoy ""Early Autumn"", ""Pastime"" or ""Playmates"" much more."
5,Outstanding addition to the series,"Parker is in top form as Spenser investigates financial and sexual escapades in an Enron-like company. The book is heavier on plot than some of his later works which is a welcome development. As usual the dialogue is amusing and literate. Susan, Hawk, Rita Fiore, and Vinnie Morris all return. Hawk has a new girlfriend and it appears to be a serious relationship. I hope we see more of her in the next book.I was interested in another reviewer's comment that Spenser was the new Travis McGee. I remember that when John MacDonald died, I wondered if there was another author whose new books I could anticipate with the same eagerness, knowing that reading them would be sheer joy. Then I discovered Parker and Spenser!"
3,someone to watch over me,"This is the 31st novel in the Spenser series. The Boston PI is trying to get the goods on a cheating husband when the husband turns up dead. This leads Spenser to a series of intrigues involving wife-swapping at a ""power selling"" company and a contoversial radio psychologist.The stakes are a little low here, the villains are too buffoonish to do more than confuse Spenser for little while, and the client is a bit of shrew. Old fans of this series will enjoy Spenser's warmly erotic relationship with his longtime love Susan and his friendship with loyal sidekick Hawk. Parker' s droll humor is on display and he has a way with how men talk to each other. If you're an old fan, you'll enjoy this, but if you're new to this series, start with an old one like EARLY AUTUMN or LOOKING FOR RACHEL WALLACE."
2,Light & Entertaining,I enjoyed this mystery. It was fun. Spenser always has a wisecrack. The story is okay but I wasn't bored.
3,"Not the best, not the worst.","This is NOT an Anvil, SKB, or other top-notch case. It's not an ATA flight-approved case. It IS an inexpensive, well-padded, light-weight protective case for your microphones. One of the latches sticks a bit and has to be wiggled to close just right. But not bad enough to send it back and pay the shipping charges again. Gator is a poor-man's SKB....a good option if you're not going to subject it to too much abuse."
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SCALE,"I purchased this for my business. After receiving notices from the USPS for shipping charges, DUE TO THE INACCURACY OF THIS SCALE, I realized this listing doesn't indicate the increments are 1/2lb! Which ultimately renders this USELESS! Even my FEDEX shipments have been INACCURATE!You have to GUESS the weight for shipping charges, ultimately costing you more money!HAD I KNOWN THIS, I NEVER WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THIS!"
4,"Good, but not that good","Don't get me wrong...This is a great scale. With the airlines being so tight on weights these days, its a must have. I just don't know if it is worth the 170.00 bucks?"
2,Worked great at first,"Had the product not even a year and it worked great. Until recently I turn it on and the 404 comes up and will not move from this screen. I have tried unplugging and other ways to reset and can not get it to come off of this setting. Therefore, I am unable to use the item. I am hopping it will come back on it's own. Seems to be built well. And was a great product while working. But it should last much longer than 10 months."
4,Very Nice Training,I have seen this DVD several times and it does a very good job of explaining the basics of Painter X. I am new to the program and found the information to be very helpful. Mr. Sutton is easy to listen to and does a good job with the tutorials.
4,slow/delayed copy,"This is very useful to learn Painter X, however, for some reason the copy that I bought is delayed and when he speaks his mouth moves, but the words are slow. Don't know what happened there..."
2,Grey Disappointment,"This book is very hard to navigate due to its layout. The pictures get in the way of the natural flow of words. It is rather difficult to discern paragraph distinctions and there are a few typos. Some of the information in this book is suspect, and the author contradicts himself several times. I feel vastly disappointed with this book however, there are some fantastic photographs of the African Grey parrots.Regards,William R. Culver Jr."
2,Good information - odd presentation,"The information in this book is helpful, however, I live in a different world of organization I guess.I can not get used to the presentation."
5,Having an open Mind,"I bought this book in 1976. I was working my first job in a healthfood store as a stock girl. I was sixteen and loving life. This book is awsome. Having an open mind will make your reading experience fun, interesting, informative and enlightening. Take what information you need and use it. We are all living to Evolve into the Best person we can be and Viktoras Kulvinskas has some helpful hints to learn. I passed my book on a few times and still have one for my own reference. I continue Loving Life...Namaste!!!"
2,Hose Nozzle,"Will only turn off in one direction and comes on at full pressure, great if you are trying to blast holes in your lawn."
5,Sturdy and Reliable,"Nice little gadget. I use it with my mp3 disc player and my Lyra when driving the car with only a CD player. While the signal will get a bit fuzzy after a while, it is really pretty reliable and easily set up.Also it's sturdy. It's oval rounded shape and size must remind one of Jack Russell Terriers of a dinner biscuit because I've caught him twice chewing on it. Now it has some tooth marks but otherwise works just fine."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"The nice thing about this product is that it is small and portable. There's even a tuning wheel on the side to further adjust the reception. However, that's about all that's good with Dynex Portable FM transmitter. There is constantly some sort of static, no matter how far or close you move the thing to the receiver. Even adjusting the wire does not help. I've tried using it in the house with the stereo system, but that's even worse than using it in the car. It appears that the only time it had crystal clear quality was when it was placed in my lap with one end hanging on one side of my thigh and the other end hanging on the other side, and even then, this position does not guarantee static-free reception. You definitely get what you pay for in this case. A cheaply made product for a cheap price. I don't recommend getting it."
3,"Functions, but not stellar","It works as promised, but it really is as if you unplugged it from one computer and plugged it into the other one. Takes about 2 seconds before it is fully connected to the other computer.The Belkin P/S 2 switchers were a little cleaner, and the computer didn't seem to notice that the device was unplugged (unfortunately, my keyboard is USB only)."
2,Finicky product,"After experiencing frustration, I called tech support and they confirmed some drawbacks. Any high end speakers, like my JBL Creatures, will make static noise. If any of your computers goes into sleep mode, you lose connection with that computer. Activating hot key for the first time takes three tries. I also need to start and shut off computers is a certain order or else I lose USB connection."
1,Might as well do it manually...,"I'll be perfectly honest, I've implemented USB devices before and I know it's hard. But this KVM is mostly useless. It seems to have issues with newer computers, or possibly just having more computers plugged into it.A KVM is only useful if you can type and use the mouse. This one ""forgets"" or ""loses"" my keyboard about 1 in 3 times that I switch machines. This requires connecting and disconnecting the mouse, keyboard and even computer in the vain hope of getting some to work again. Heck it took me 5min to be able to write this review!!I'll probably never buy another IOGear KVM, and I'll be looking for others, I mean I might as well be switching the cables by hand at this point..."
3,Good depending on Mouse and Keyboard,"Like many of the positive reviews, this unit works pretty well. It's much better than my previous KVM; but beware the compatibility issues. I had a older MS wheeled optical which kept disconnecting and then reconnecting - very annoying. I replaced it with a newer blue MS optical and the problems went away.Similarly, using a PS2 keyboard through a USB converter didn't work very well; but the basic Dell keyboard works fine. IOGear should definitely list compatibility on their website."
2,Great... when it works,"Up to four computers can share the same keyboard, monitor, mouse, and speakers. I only use it for the keyboard and mouse with my setup.The issue with this product is that it occasionally powers the USB off and then back on. This causes keys to get ""stuck,"" and so when you meant to type the word ""the"" it comes out like ""thhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhe.""If this happened once in a blue moon I could learn to grin and bear it. But it happens at least once a day, usually several times. A truly poor product. Iogear's older models weren't as cool looking but performed far more reliably.Conclusion: Find a different brand or an older product from Iogear."
2,Doesn't work with wireless keyboards.,"This item doesn't work with wireless keyboards. For the first day I was able to use this without any problems whatsoever from my Microsoft Wireless Natural Multimedia keyboard but come Monday, whenever I type, randomly a key will be repeated continously. It does stop but it is a major annoyance. Just be warned that this KVM switch does not work with wireless keyboards."
1,BEWARE: does not latch video or have mouse/kb support on unselected hosts,"We bought this unit a few months back for use with our three Apple Mac Minis.We quickly discovered it had some significant flaws --* Video floats on unselected hostsHosts not selected have their video resolution revert to that of a generic monitor (act as if they have no video input)* No keyboard/mouse emulation on unselected hostsHosts not selected start complaining they have no kb or mouse after short intervals or rebootIn other words, this unit is little more than an ABCD switch for USB/VGA/Audio.This is significant as the unselected hosts can still be connected to via OS XTiger's and Leopard's VNC/Remote desktop/Back to my Mac support.This *may* be less of an issue with Windows PCs.This unit does not meet our minimum requirements for an KVM and we are looking for a replacement unit."
2,Sketchy at Best,This product is really pretty horrible. Power to the mouse port will cut out intermittently and come back on. At one point power is completely cut to the mouse and you have to switch to another port of the kvm to have it restored. Also doesn't pickup keyboard input some of the time and then acts as if you've been holding the button you pressed for a few seconds. Really a big piecer.
1,"Unreliable, slow and just plain bad","I bought this product through my office. We were looking for a 4 port KVM switch for several test systems we have. If you hit the wrong key on the keyboard, the ""error recovery"" takes forever (several minutes--maybe up to 10). Switching between the different systems requires a long sequence of key presses and if you press them in the wrong order, the switch goes into ""error mode"" again. It was pretty much useless right out of the box. Also, there is no physical button on the switch itself to switch between the different systems like most other switches have. A switch completely dependent on the keyboard is an idiotic idea. This was just a plain bad, unreliable product! It's only useable if you're a robot that presses the exact sequence of keys (4 to be precise) within some amount of time every time correctly. God forbid you press the Scroll key 3x instead of 2x!"
3,Poor description,"Note that this is a VGA-only KVM. The description doesn't say so (though if you look at the pictures, there are only VGA ports). I bought it on the strength of the supported resolution claims (20x15) under the assumption that to support that resolution, it had to be DVI compatible. It's not."
2,I like most of it...,"90% of the KVM functionality has worked for me: it works with all my machines (connects to 4 but I've actually swapped a couple in and out), it holds the keyboard and mouse, it works with my backlit Logitech G105 keyboard, it even works with my wireless logitech mouse.But...The manual states that you should be able to switch between machines and leave the audio on just one for continuous play. Or, you should be able to switch audio, but leave the kvm where it is. I've tried different keyboards and mice, but the command keys for the audio-only are not recognized. Which is a bummer as that's functionality I was hoping for. So, on balance it's a nice KVM, but beware the audio switching part - it didn't work for me."
3,Don't ask customer service for help,Bought product because web site manual stated you can listen to music from one computer and work on another. NOPE! Called customer service and they didn't know anything about several aspects of the product; I had to FAX a copy of the two pages from their manual so they could see what the product was supposed to do. It does work well and the quality seems good. I told them about some other problems and they said I had to pay the shipping cost to return the item to them. No help at all - sad case of a good product being hurt by terrible customer service. I eventually returned the item to Amazon.
1,Worthless with a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000,"Like other reviewers here, I found out after purchasing this switch that it doesn't work with a wireless keyboard. In my case, all the keys work (some s-l-o-w-l-y) except for the tab key. Tab has worked on occasion but never consistently.When I called the support line they were very familiar with the problem. The choices are: get a new keyboard and mouse or get a new KVM. They lost my business on attitude alone. IOGEAR should clearly state in their packaging and product descriptions that it doesn't work with wireless keyboards - saving us the trouble of returning their hardware."
2,I wasted my money on this one.,"I bought this product a couple of weeks ago. This product has some problems. It works fine for a couple of days and after that, it will stop recognizing one of the computers, because, the video card stopped working any more for that computer, unless I remove them and res-install them. It happened to me 3 times and I got tired of it. I thought it could be a problem with the computer. But it did the same thing with two computers. I am not using this as of now. I am looking for an alternate solution."
1,Didn't work as advertised,"IOGEAR said this would work with most wireless keyboards and mice but I couldn't get it to work with a USB keyboard and mouse. IOGEAR tech support said it was probably a defective unit and Amazon refunded the full amount and paid return postage. I didn't chance trying another one and instead used a software switcher from KAVOOM, which works acceptably for my 3 systems."
4,Solid KVM,"My previous KVM would generate random key-presses and right-clicks. Very frustrating when working at a command prompt and garbage gets spewed into the session.I've been using this KVM for two weeks on my Windows XP laptop, Ubuntu desktop, XP-64 desktop, and CentOS server with no problems at all. Switching is smooth and no garbage mouse or key clicks.Sound quality is very good.Unit comes with two fixed set of cables and two additional cables."
1,One star only because I can't give it no stars - doesn't work and support sucks,This KVM switch does not work as advertized and usually does not work at all. I called tech support and they said you cannot use a wireless keyboard. However the manual tells how to hookup a wireless keyboard & mouse. Go figure. I have tried it with USB wired keyboards (three so far) and it still does not work.I have left two more messages for tech support but have not received a call back.I have been in the IT support business for over 20 years so it may be possible that I know a little about what I am talking about.At this point I cannot recommend this product or any IOGEAR product (since tech support sucks too!). I will also tell my clients not to urchase anything IOGEAR. Back to Belkin for quality products.
2,So So for me,"I run a small-time tech support business, and expected to be able to bring a customer's PC in plug it in, and start working on it. There always seems to be an issue, with me fiddling w/ the KVM for a half an hour, and then giving up on it, and unhooking the monitor/keyboard and hooking up directly. Too much aggravation! I seem to have issues where the keyboard is not recognized until Windows boots, or I plug/unplug the mouse our keyboard to get it to be recognized. Not good, I end up needing to debug my own equipment before I get to the job at hand."
4,Great unit,"This unit is small and works very well. My only observation/complaint is that I was using a multimedia keyboard that used additional software for all of the controls on it. The switch did not get along with my third party keyboard software :o( . However, went I switched back to a standard keyboard that uses native keyboard drivers found in (Linux, Solaris and Windows) everything is fine."
1,Unreliable and bad customer service,"It could be that I just got a bad unit, but the issue is that customer service Didn't Fix It. I sent it back for repair (it was out for a month) and got the same device back with the same problem, no notes or remarks on what they might have done to fix it. I hooked up all 3 comptuers again, and it quit working again. To reset it, I have to shut down all 3 computers."
3,Does an OK job,"The console looks nice. Switching between computers is quite easy. Why the 3 stars then? Because it degrade the video quality and this is with only 2 computers connected. I am running 1280 x 1024 on a 18"" LCD. It's very obvious that the display is more blur now."
2,Worked great for a while,"This gadget comes with a 3 year warranty.It worked very well for 3 years but now it will not switch when I hit the scroll lock key.I contacted IOgear customer support. They responded very promptly but since it has been more than 3 years since I bought it, they won't help.Fair enough, the warranty was for 3 years.But I am disappointed that a device with no moving parts should fail this fast. I have an HP 6MP Laserprinter which has a lot of moving parts and has lasted more than a decade."
1,Did not work,As simple as that. Connected to my Dell sc400/hp slimline and HP Elitebook laptop. Only the first system to be powered on is identified. Even that did not have a good mouse movement. Returned it.
5,"Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. Better than expected!","This KVM switch was easy to setup with 1 HP desktop, 1 Lenovo Thinkpad, and 1 MacBook Pro. And unlike my old KVM switch, I have no more problems with my computers recognizing what type of monitor I have or what the best resolution should be. I also love the integrated way to switch between computers by using the keyboard instead of a button on the KVM switch. And lastly, the price on Amazon was so much cheaper that other stores. Definitely an awesome deal."
3,Finally a hero who likes Cats!,"I was pleasently suprised by this book. I liked the fact that the heroine is not some young, extreamly beautiful girl but a mature(30 yrs old) handsome woman who keeps her hero on his toes. He has been married 4 times and all of his wives have died leaving him with 7 children. He really loves his kids and it is enjoyable to read about him playing with them and even accepting their pets. One of his daughters has a huge, and I do mean huge, collection of cats. I think the count is 25 or more. He even carries one around for a bit and seems to enjoy loving it. He may be a strong, demanding, powerful man but he is also one with deep feelings and passionate love for both his family, his land and his new bride."
1,Not true to history,"I found this book to be too slow.......and not true to historical fact...I don't believe they called the kitchen, a kitchen in the 16th century nor did women wear blouses. The violin wasn't the instrument of choice either. My favourite authors are Julie Garwood and Johanna Lindsey and this author has a long way to go to catch up to them."
4,"Not sure of historical value, BUT","I enjoyed this book on a purely entertainment level. I loved all the twists and turns. I found the romance to be a bit much at times, but loved the overall context of the book. Def not one sorry to own!"
2,"No more scot accent, please!","Why is it that when a romance book is set in Scotland it becomes almost unreadable? When a book is set in France, the author does not write the dialogue in French or in English with a French accent. The author assumes that we, as intelligent readers, will know that the characters are speaking in the language of their country. Then why are we subjected to ""dinna"" and ""ken"" all through books set in Scotland? Please! We know that Scottish characters will speak with a Scottish burr. We do not need to be hit over the head!If you do not mind wading through the dialogue, the story is fun and enjoyable."
3,"DVD weak, CD Great .","I am so glad to see the Brother's Johnson have gotten back together after the feud that was profiled on VH-1 many years ago. The DVD is ok. The sound quality is in and out, especially when it comes to hearing Louis playing his bass and hearing the background singers. If you go to the extra features on the DVD, listen to the interview with Louis and George. You can tell that George rules over Louis. George also has some unflattering comments about Ringo Starr's drum playing. The CD, on the other hand, sounds great. I am sure that it had some help from the studio, but you can hear everything that the live DVD could not pick up. Louis's bass and George's guitar solos sound fantastic. If your are a Brother Johnson fan, the DVD will not bother you and it will be a nice purchase for your collection."
1,Like,"I like the little packets, instead of the big tube. They are a little more expensive per oz, but its nice to know whoever used it last in the household didn't contaminate the whole tube, or leave the top off. (if you have kids or a spouse, you know what I mean)"
4,Good resin for the money,"I use this in a dry climate at a high altitude, and it never lets me down. Great intonation-you really feel like you can dig into the string and produce a nice sound."
4,lovely shirt,"This is probably the 10th or 12th ""The Mountain"" T-shirt I've purchased but it's the 1st one I've purchased for myself (instead of for my husband). I love the colors, the graphics & how it does in the laundry. The only fault I find with it is the size seems to run smaller than other t-shirts the same size that I have."
4,2500 BLK Stanley Bostitch Stapler,This stapler is very reliable and lightweight. It does not jam and is easy to use. It is a very good value and much better than competitor staplers like swingline or staples brand staplers. I am surprised that office depot and staples do not carry this stapler but it is easy enough to obtain through Amazon online.
1,Not what I expected,"I can't rate this product with even one star! I received my product and some of the brackets were bent, broken, uneven and I felt as thought something that should've taken about 10 min. to put together took too long. I spent too much time trying to ensure that this piece was together correctly I finally got fed up, left it alone and then came back to it. How do you sell someone something that has pieces messed up and tell the person that it's brand new. I don't believe this was new as the instructions were missing from the box upon my long awaited receipt of the cage. I ordered on December 5 and didn't receive until December 23, why doesn't it take 2 weeks for something like this to arrive but it only takes 10 seconds to verify and retrieve the funds from a credit card? Don't buy it, it's not worth it! Go to a store and get one!Brand New Bird Cage Cages 18x14x46 With Stand 5894Blk/S"
4,Good primer in opposition party politics in Mexico,"This book outlines the changes that have taken place in Mexican politics since the 1988 presidential election there, focusing specifically on the development of the PRD from being a personalistic vehicle for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas to being a true political party of the left. Bruhn places this development in the context of the changes in the broader political environment which have been occurring in Mexico and which have facilitated the emergence of the PRD. Specifically, she addresses the challenges that the PRD has faced in attaining internal consolidation among the PRD's component parts and external institutionalization in the one-party dominant system. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Mexican party system."
3,Easy to Understand,This book is very well organized and easy to understand. I do think more recent books are better as they are far more current.
4,Love Songs and Laughs,"I wore this album out on my turntable when I was a kid so I was thrilled to be able to enjoy these wonderful songs again on CD. After 30 years I still knew all the words! My only disappointment was the song ""I'm Feeling Fine."" On my original album that song was very melancholy and pure and on the CD it has a perkier arrangement that diminishes it IMO. Still, thanks to the brilliance of Paul Williams this is more than simply a piece of pleasurable nostalgia."
5,"Well worthwhile, family-friendly entertainment","While you can find comprehensive reviews of the story and stars, I would recommend this as a family-friendly movie, with an enjoyable CD soundtrack available to serve as a non-video souvenir of the movie. I watched the movie as a child, and was happy to now share this movie with my wife and son and another young family."
3,It's All Right I Guess,"Certain songs are good like ""so you wanna be boxer"",""My name is Talluahlah"" but alot of songs are just annoying oops i mean the rest are annoying."
4,Not Much To Say: 4*,"Either you know of this rarity(& love it), or you have no idea what it is(& you're curious); either way, it's worth the low price, and isn't readily avaiable in the U.S., anyway.It's Baio's first job, and the continuing of Foster's turn into a mature performer(regardless of the whole 'kid characters' concept).And the music is almost too catchy sometimes(in a good way)! If you enjoy the movie, you might wanna grab the soundtrack! Do so..."
3,The way a real scifi event would go...,"First time reading Greg Bear after recommendation from my son. This book really made me think about our human-centric focus. There was a lot of science jargon in here I didn't understand but that wasn't the point. I was more interested in the psychological effects of the characters dealing with such an ""unthinkable"" event. Bear pulls no punches, no whiz-bang gadgets materialize. I'm going to Yosemite soon. I won't be looking at those gigantic, geologic formation quite the same way now. Very interesting read."
3,It's OK,"I bought this as a time filler while waiting for the next Neal Stephenson (for example) to come out. I read it cover to cover so it did the job. I like more science in the science fiction. The psychology and sociology should ""work"" too. I feel like the author gave himself too many liberties in all three areas."
5,Luther Allison: A BLUES Master!,This is a must have in the COL-LEC-TION if you DIG the Blues & Luther Allison. What a KILLER CD this one is. Great purchase. Long live Luther!
5,Incredible take-no-prisoners blues album,"I can't say too much that listening to the samples above won't more eloquently say for themselves..stripped down, visceral, authoritative blues. If you like blues, this one's a keeper!"
5,FABULOUS!!!!!!!!,"When I first heard the song ""Jackie"" on an AbFab episode, I was truly floored. One word describes this album: FABULOUS!!!!!!!!"
1,Beyond Awful,"Okay, picture the absolute worst bit of fiction you've ever read. Now imagine trying to read that while simultaneously having your eyes gouged out with a rusty nail, listening to a thousand people scraping their fingernails down a thousand chalkboards, and being force-fed the decaying corpse of a diseased sewer rat. Okay, got a good picture of that? Reading this book is approximately 75,600,380 times worse."
1,Are you kidding?,"This has to be the WORST book I've read so far. I couldn't even finish it. It's that bad. How this author was able to get this book published with the [...] . From the start it's like he doesn't know what to say, so he makes up some crap. Avoid this book and those fake reviews! Anyone that reads expects more from any book. And this one doesn't deliver anything more then a headache trying to decipher what the author is talking about."
3,Hard Beats for the Long-Term,"Eboman, Keoki, the Crystal Method and more contibute to this great hardcore techno compilation. The beats are solid and fast, the bass is juicy, the beeps and samples trypnotic. This'll trance you out faster than a bucket of pills."
2,Dated Big beat,"This is not Hardcore Techno. This is dated big beat in the vein of the Chemical Brothers. 1or 2 decent tracks but mostly unoriginal,erratic and badly presented fluff."
5,Walcott and the Getway,"This is one of the great records of Manfred Eicher's ECM company. Walcott cut this groove right after Dejohnette, Holland and Abercrombie finished the first Getway album (another landmark of creative music and bullsblood jazzrock). I guess the guys kept riding the enlightened wave. The scitar sound transforms the solid rhythm session into a delightful flight through space and time. My favorite tunes: Margueritte, Scimitar, Eastern Song and Cloud Dance."
2,You get what you pay for,"This price for this unit makes it quite enticing, however, as an owner of one of these, I would be cautious about purchasing for the following reasons--It takes about 20 seconds to initialize,-The software is quite weak,-There are gaps between tracks-The random functions only within a folder, not within all of the music files- so essentially you have to listen to one album at a time or throw everything in a giant unorganized folder if you want some variety--Battery life is 4 hours tops, and is significantly diminished when using the backlight.If you can spend some extra money for an ipod nano, I would definately recommend it."
2,ehhh.....not that great,"Well, like many others have said, the cover was really nice looking. However, as the book progresses, it becomes rather tedious to read. THe main character, Alexa, talks like an old man, and the climax doesn't quite fit the climax i was expecting. Overall, its not all that great, but younger kids will probably enjoy reading it."
5,This was an awesome book!,"This was a very good book if you ask me. It drew me in because I am also a 12 year old girl, and I LOVE to sneak around and spy just like Alexa. I would definitely reccomend this book to other pre-teen girls who love to read."
4,"Worth a try, but hit or miss","The heroine narrator is fairly well developed, and might very well appeal to a young reader. She's bright, and curious, and self-reliant, and could be someone your young reader wants to join on a fantasy adventure. If not, well, the rest of the book is fairly undistinguished. The fantasy world is undeveloped, the wall conceit doesn't make a lot of sense, the quest is sort of vague, and the mystery isn't very mysterious.But, even if it isn't all that original or suspenseful, it's a workmanlike effort and worth consideration."
2,Pretty much a copy of Kingdoms and the Elves,"The lead character in Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches is 13 year old Adrina, a girl who lives in the walled city of Imtal. The whole meet the characters thing is from Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reaches too."
2,eh..,"This book bored me, quite honestly. It was cliche, hard to get into, and a little cheesy to me. Harry Potter was a lot better."
3,Switch-er-oooo,When i first saw this book i was mezmorized by the detailed cover. The beginning of the book was really slow and I wanted to stop and read a different book but my teacher encouraged me to keep going. Towards the middle of the book it got much better and I was glad that my teacher wouldn't let me switch books. It was an overall good book but it wasn't the best I have ever read.
4,Pervis Kotcher Stinks!!!!,"I really enjoyed the book, but I think some of the charecters went over the edge, such as when Pervis Kotcher gets drunk and they explain what his barf looks like. If you are looking at buying this for your kid, make sure they are 10 or older."
5,Good book,"I love this book. My young niece wanted me to read it, so I was reluctant at first but happy I did, now we can talk about Alex's and her adventures cause I plan on reading all of the books. :)"
2,Where's the Spark?,"This book was just below okay and rather disappointing for me. To be fair I will say that the concept was interesting and writing decent. True I was never quite sure what to make of Alexa, but she wasn't the most immediate issue I faced while reading. The real problem was the missing spark of life. The point where the story went from something you read to a place you could occupy in your imagination. I never felt a compulsion to enter into the Land of Elyon.I found the lifelessness more sad than anything else (especially since writing a book is a lot of work). I have read books much more mundane in their concepts and the writing with a lot to wish for, but they had the life giving spark which made a world of difference."
5,A very good book,"This was a good book, but the begining was boring. The middle was exciting, and friends turn on her. Sad sometimes. A good book for people who like magical mystery."
2,Mediocre at best.,"This book had an interesting concept, but the writing itself simply wasn't very good. On the surface it seems good, a young girl sets off to solve a mystery, save her town, and reveal a traitor. All with the help of some animal friends. Unfortunately the excecution of the story simply wasn't very good. The girl doesn't really solve the mystery, she merely wanders about and people explain things to her. She doesn't actually save the town, or herself. That doesn't make her a strong female protaganist, that makes he a helpless little girl. Not appealing.There were also a lot of plot holes. I know this is a children's book, but children aren't dumb. They deserve a tight, cohesive story and good characters. This book really didn't have either. I'm assuming the later books get better as the author improved his craft, but I don't know if I want to risk my money or time on them."
5,Exciting Fantasy Adventure,"The Dark Hills Divide-the first in The Land of Elyon series-is an exciting new fantasy novel from talented writer Patrick Carman. Featuring a charming story with a heroine (Alexa) whom all readers can relate to, the book is full of wonderfully descriptive language and delightfully inventive images. This is a highly entertaining adventure, full of mysteries, that every child will want to embark on. Who wouldn't want to be smart and resourceful Alexa as she sets out to solve numerous mysteries and save the land? Mr. Carman has created a rich and intriguing world that children will love to plunge into. Surprising twists and ample suspense keep the reader on the edge of his/her seat. I breathlessly await Book 2, Beyond the Valley of the Thorns."
4,Awsome Book,"""The Dark Hills Divide""- the fisrt book of The Land Of Elyon series- is a wonderful book. I believe that many people would love this book. It is a great book, especailly for those who just can't stop reading when there is suspense in a book. I recommend this suspenseful book to children between the ages of 8 and 13 who love fantasy books. It is hard to top stories like J.K Rowling's Harry Potter books and Cornelia Funke's ""Inkheart"" but in my opinion ""The Dark Hills Divide"" comes close. So engage yourself in the thrilling tale of ""The Dark Hills Divide"" by Patrick Carman.KC"
5,"I read this book once, now I'm reading it again!",The Dark Hills Divide is an excellent book. I recently bought book 2 and decided to go back and read book 1 again. I liked this book from the first page. I can't wait until I read the second book. I would recommend this book for kids age 9-12.
1,Extremely Disappointed,"My ten year old daughter and I were excited about this book. The cover graphics are beautiful and the story sounded interesting. We could not get past chapter five. It is a chore to read. I skimmed ahead and it did not get any better. We really wanted to like this book, but it is very boring and tedious. This is definitely a case were you should not judge a book by its cover."
3,confused-some spoiler info,"For the most part this book was an enjoyable read. Patrick Carman wrote some funny parts and some enjoyable scenes, however there were too many long-winded moments that made the book too slow. It seemed to take forever for the plot to actually kick into gear.Finally, we came upon Alexa's mission, to discover and confront the evil Sebastian. Earlier we learned that Sebastian was a convict and all convicts were labeled with a ""C"" on their forhead. I was curious and found it mysterious that a convict could wander around and not be found out. How did Sebastian hide the ""C""? I puzzled over it. Finally, it turns out that it was under his beard. I must have missed something, but I didn't know that people could grow beards on their foreheads.I was still entertained, but yet those small details make me feel ripped off. I won't continue reading this series."
1,Boring,I always wondered how books like this get published. Only goes to show that there are bad editors.
4,el Borbah detective stories,"I'm a big fan of Charles Burns' work, when I ran across this on Amazon it was a ""had-to-have"" and I was not disappointed. ""Pulp"" style detective stories with a 1950's sci-fi feel, along with Burns's incredible artwork, make this book a great addition to any self-confessed geek's bookshelf!"
1,Blah,"His later work is far superior. While the style is luscious, the content is lacking. The so-called ""humor"" is very pathetic. Not amusing in the least, even for demented fans of El Santo and mexican wrestling. Pass!"
3,Fairly nice,"These type of letter openers are hard to find. First, it is hand held, battery operated and powerful and sharp. Next it can be operated from either side as it is unidirectional. So it's perfect for opening your daily mail in a flash.But, although the name sound foreign and quality made, it's still a cheaply made Chinese junky unit that suffers poor build quality as all their cheap junk does. I had to replace the first one I got because of a battery door that would not close, but with Amazon, it was no problem at all. That's what makes Amazon the best place to buy!"
3,tepid attempt at a Clark Terry sound,"I purchased this CD hoping that Sandoval and Calle would play a greater role in the expressive, driving melodic lines for which they are so justly famous......their names are, after all, on the album cover. Instead, a smooth and warm(yes, Frankie V does have that Flugel sound alright)horn player attempting to create unique ad lib lines, comes across merely staying in the harmonic structure but never saying anything, musically. I was hoping for the inventiveness of a Clark Terry on the Flugelhorn....after all the hype about this player. I couldn't even finish the album....started nodding-off, unable to find the least bit of inspiration nor creativity in the melodic lines.The back-up team is sensational, laying down a rock-solid sense of time for the soloist. I wish the creativity were there. Look for Clark Terry CD's if you're anticipating liquid, honey-like phasing and creative melodic lines."
3,If you don't need real jazz,"I love the ""Bebop"" era and its content, so bear with me. This is OK ""smooth jazz"" and it has its place. Just not anywhere in my collection. I once owned it and gave it to a ""smooth jazzer."""
5,Frankie V Sounds Amazing!,"What a wonderful album, my wife and I listen to it all the time.Frankie V is a wonderful trumpet player. Buy This Album!"
2,Great if you know nothing about free software - otherwise avoid the book...,"To be short and to the point... the title basically covers the primary issue I had with the book... I felt most of the book could be summed up in about 20 pages but yet it was still a full book of how to go get a free piece of software, connect a GPS, and chart where you were going...Note: I was most likely disappointed because I was truly looking for a much more technical discussion on how GPS databases work and how to decode GIS information. In the past when I have prucased books form the publisher they were much more in depth on technical aspects of the systems, data, and so forth. In this case it was a discussion of how to sue free software and a GPS... no truly what I had in mind.Oh, well... other I'm sure will enjoy it... just didn't fill the bill for me..."
4,not for your pontoon rails,"This product works perfect and is easy to use, but, the clip does not fit my 1 1/4"" square pontoon rails. I wish the clip was wider."
5,Berndes Cookware,"We have tried many brands of cookware but are totally satisfied with Berndes. We now have skillets, and various sizes of pans by this manufacturer and highly recommend this product to those seeking the highest quality cookware."
2,It might be great,"I never received the 9.5"" skillet what I got instead twice was a 9.5"" saute pan with lid. A great product but not what I had ordered. Having said that, I placed this order to replace the 9.5"" Berndes SignoCast skillet that we received as a wedding gift 15 years ago. This product is great. Heats evenly, coating does not flake off or become funky and we use this skillet nearly every day. I will look elsewhere for this product as Amazon was unable to fill this order twice."
1,Aero Soarer - Product by Tomitech,"I received this item for Christmas. The plane is extremely fragile, made from flimsy styrofoam, and will probably break in the first 5-10 minutes of use, like mine did. The battery for the plane is limited to only 30 seconds, and is constantly needing to be recharged. The instructions are somewhat sarcastic and a bit funny to read. When you do get it, it is very difficult to fly. All and all I reccomend that you do not by this piece of crap, as it is a waste of money and time."
4,What a beautiful timepiece!,"I've owned my Android watch for several years now, and it is one of the best watches I've ever owned in terms of beauty. This model is unique in that the face will reflect a different color depending on the angle and the light. It has nice weight to it, and it's very easy to read.The only con I can list is the band. It feels tremendous, and it's a perfect fit for this watch. Unfortunately, the little rubber piece that holds the loose end of the band in place broke off, and it's very expensive to get a replacement through the manufacturer.Other than that, I LOVE this watch, and plan on wearing it more once I get my band replaced."
2,Mickey Mouse excuse for baking,Bought EasyBake Oven & Snack Center for 7-yr-old granddaughter. It included only 1 tiny cookie mix and 1 tiny cake & frosting mix. The mixes are minuscule. The mixes are sl small it's almost impossible to even stir in the water. It's hard to even get the tiny pan bottom covered with the small amount of mix - and only one layer - come on! None of the buttons work - how much would it take to make the timer a manual-operating timer?
2,Ok idea,Probably more educational to help you child bake and cook on the appliances you already have at home. These little cake mixes are expensive for what they are.
4,The best,The easy bake oven is great. My daughter learns to bake in in a oven.Its just the best for her
1,What is happening here???,This has a price of 79$ What is happening with Amazon? This is 11.99 at target!
5,Very effective advice...not too technical,"What I really liked about this book is its simplicity (it's also very nicely laid out and easy to read). The author is not one of those ""gurus"" who tells you you to follow his plan and buy his products. He's obviously an athletic guy in good shape who adheres to the ""school of good health and sense!"" The advice is simple but effective...he tells you how to start exercise gradually, eat well, and avoid the bad habits that can ruin your health. Sounds simple enpugh, but he also shows you how! Really good book!"
2,You get what you pay for here,I used this with a 10 gallon tank. I had the thermometer set to 79 degrees. I had this thing on the side right next to the heater. It showed 70 degrees when I had the heater on 79 degrees. I moved the heater up to 82 degrees and this thing said 74 degrees. I don't know what was wrong but I didn't think this thing worked so I sent it back.
5,Best he ever did,This is by far the best Scott Walker album. There seems to be a war between the Scott 3 and the Scott 4 fans. But in my opinion this is where the real Scott Walker shines. Buy them both and decide which camp you are in.
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this album on the strength of reviews like the ones here but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The musical material is shallow, his voice is OK but has a rather irritating wide vibrato. It's fine for background music but for serious listening look elsewhere."
4,Furher aquintance with Ron Rash,"My first experience with Ron Rash, was by his latest book; Serena and I promptly made a decision to read as much as possible from him. So my second book was One foot in Eden and I loved every minute of it./This book is about storytelling in it most original form. It is shame that whem Ron Rash was in my country for the promotion of Serena, I was not aware of it. I would have loved to hear him on writing his books. I am certain that he has won the hearts of many of my countrymen.I do hope that some will follow my advice and buy the rest of his oeuvre as wel. He deserves it.Richard H.K. Pohlmann"
4,Everyday life,"The book is a little slow to get going, but once you are into it, it's hard to put down... and you want more. It's a story set in the past, but has a lot of today values and problems. The characters had some tough decisions to make. It's a good mystery and even I was fooled, which I am usually not. Life... goes on."
3,so-so,"Only in reading reviews herein did I realize Mr. Rash also writes children's book. This explains much as Eden hardly qualifies as a southern novel. Two-dimensional characters with little development set in a two dimensional south. I lived for decades in the hills Mr. Rash writes about, and never generated an empathy with any character he describes. Sorry, but ""city-folk"" should quit gushing over this book."
5,perfect book club book,"Our book club read this and it turned into one of the most interesting and thought-provoking sessions in our life. The book is a breathtaking work of writing, and a page-turner in the process."
1,Awful...,"I tried, but couldn't get into this book. I got to maybe page 100....just slow moving, hard to keep attention. The book changes narrators...which is confusing.Disappointed, since it had such ""great"" reviews."
1,Not universal.,I bought these to power some EnGenius access points I had bought. These werent compatible at all. So I ended up having to ship them back. They are also rather bulky.
1,Does not power any of my 1141N AP,"it was offered together with the AIR-AP1141N-A-K9 and says that would power up these models.but the fact is that it does nothing at all.later somewhere in the site it say it only works with the following compatibility: Cisco Aironet Series Access Points: 1100 , 1200 , 1220 , 1230so please clear this doubt and i would rate again."
4,Enjoyable and real,"I haven't read a juvenile fiction book in quite some time but the voice of the narrator is what made me want to read Begging for Change. It's the story of Raspberry, a young girl who is going through much adversity that involves her family and friends. I think Raspberry is a character that kids or grownups can understand. She is emotional - mad, happy, afraid, shy, indignant, jealous, and everything in between. She's not perfect, she's real and that's a wonderful attribute to find in fiction. If you enjoy reading about young people and want to understand how they think and where they are coming from in terms of friendships, family, loyalty, and justice, you might enjoy reading Begging for Change."
4,Begging,"This is the story of a young girl whose father is a drug addict and her mother is trying to get ahead in life. Raspberry's mother is dating her best friend's father, a doctor. Raspberry's mother is brutally attacked and ends up in the hospital. While Raspberry is trying to deal with the incident, the area they live in and the fact that her father should have been there to protect them, she makes some bad decisions and steals some money. This threatens to tear her friendships apart and eats at her unmercifully. Unpleasant encounters with her father where he steals from her sets her on the path to thinking she has become like her. Raspberry has to go through a lot of thoughtful soul searching to set things right in her life. Excellent book. This is one that teens will definitely be able to relate to."
1,Definitely not worth the money,"Check out ebay where this product sells for $20 + shipping. And I doubt they are losing money on it. Not even sure about the quality of this product either: the ""patented innovation"" is simply a magnetic bar that removes the metal shaving-containing mud. I'm irritated enough to post my first ever review on amazon."
4,Good but don't get burned on price,This stuff is the best exfoliant on the market without doubt. It leaves a natural moisture in the skin and feels fantastic. However I had the misfortune of being ripped off at an airport (Calgary) recently and they are charging 5 times what the cost is on Amazon. Buyer beware - the product is good but the marketing is illegitimate. On buy Israeli products it is $70. At airports it will be double. So buy it on Amazon and tell your friends to also as direct retailing is pretty close to being direct theft.
3,"Buy online, not at the mall","This product stimulated my skin well, exfoliating and tightening the texture after one use. Unfortunately, I bought it at the mall where the cost was $100 - a ripoff and I should have known better to purchase from a company that did not post their prices. Price at Amazon is reasonable as compared with other online up to $149!!"
5,A great writer,"Graham Greene is one of those authors like Hemingway who may ""go out of style"" --this will be a great pity--there transparant but subtle modernism of the first half of the first half of the century Greene and Waugh will go out of style. Already they are being replaced by a Rushdie sense of the text as an elaborate joke or rather elaborate shape.These are wonderful stories and like Poe's should be preserved and cherished."
3,One major flaw,These are priced right and look very good. They appear to hold up well but have one major flaw. If you don't have at least one side attached to a shelf then it is very wobbly and unstable making it hard to open or close. I will have to put a piece of wood on the bracket to stabilize it against the wall. If you only have one or two of them and they are connected to a shelf on either side then I would give it a 5 rating.
1,"High price, junk manufacturing","I bought a PE10, which is almost identical to this model. I assumed it was well made given the high price.After using it just a few dozen times, I was shocked to have broken off the top of my unit: when picking up the envelope I laid on the scale, one of my fingers accidentally pressed the plastic top of the scale upwards. The force from just *one finger* broke off the top of the scale (held in only by tiny plastic pieces).I've never seen such crappy quality, let alone at such an expensive price (nearly $100 with power adapter at time of purchase). DEFINITELY not recommended."
2,"Waited on refund for return, w/ no communication","When questions about product, there was good communication. Correct product pictured and described, but different model received. Which usually might not be a big deal, but I needed to weigh a certain volume. That wasn't possible on the model. Once I inquired about return and was instructed in how to do so, I did return for refund. When waiting for the refund, is when all communication broke down. I tried to communicate in multiple ways, including e-mail I had when we had communicated and also through Amazon, but I never heard anything back. I gave it time between all communication, but after a while I had to contact Amazon, and finally got it resolved and received refund."
4,"Good scale, but why not include an AC adaptor?","Excellent scale I've used for years off and on. I used to use this model daily when I worked with wildlife to weigh small animals, now use it to monitor the weight of my own parrot. Also comes in handy when selling stuff online to know the exact shipping price.I just don't like having to rely on batteries, I prefer plugging into an outlet (neither power sources included). Would be a 5 star product if it included and AC adapter for the same price."
4,Works for Me,"I bought this to sell my old stuff (or stuff I no longer needed) on Ebay and Amazon Marketplace. Mainly DVD's, CD's, books, video games, etc. I found that it has been totally accurate when I've gone to the post office to mail the items. The scale is small and compact. I like it and it suits my needs."
2,Pelouze Flyweight(?) Scale,"My wife bought this scale and we returned it that same day. Although this scale is supposed to weigh items up to 5 lbs, the entire scale itself weighed maybe 1.7 lbs. The plunger or stem seemed cheaply constructed too. Also, on the box it states that there is a 3 yr warranty, but on this website it states a lifetime warranty. We were confused so we called Pelouze's customer service. Customer Service said, one (1) year warranty, period. I told customer service there must be a mistake. Customer service put me on hold. When she came back she said nope, no mistake, one year warranty on this model regardless of what the manufacturer's packaging stated. I told her this was too confusing and we would have to return the scale, C/S lady immediately thanked me (?); so we returned it."
3,Adequate,"I've owned a set of these scales before and knew they'd be adequate for weighing letters. I wouldn't trust the accuracy 100%. If it's close to the next ounce, be sure to err on the side of caution and add extra postage. I ordered them because I was in a hurry to replace a lost set of scales, and for the money, it was the best that Amazon offered at the time."
5,great analog item,"It's nice to have a product that doesn't require power, and is reliable and accurate!!! Thanks Dymo for a great scale!!!"
1,Useless when postal rates change,"This scale and an identical one under the Dymo brand are great until the rates change. Although they advertise that the dial with the rates can be replaced, there is no place I can find on the internet that offers replacements. Well, one does, but the site indicates that there are none currently available.M Read"
1,Crap,Learn from an online coach. Read a lot of what THEY tell you to read. Skip all this stuff. Don't do any purchases on your own. Use a Poker Coach.
1,a warrantee they'll rarely honor,"We bought this skillet (and paid a premium price for a nonstick pan) believing the lifetime warrantee for a replacement if the cooking finish bubbled up or deteriorated from use. We used only the recommended non stick utensils and the finish got scratched anyway. Berndes would not replace the pan, stating that the pan was improperly used. I would not buy their product again."
3,Great activity center for 4-6 months only..read review,"We really enojoyed watching our 4 month old play in the activity center. However, when we went to remove the bottom disk at 6 months old and allow him to roam around, we discovered that he was too tall for it??? He is 29 inches long and unable to use the activity center to stroll because he would need to be ""walking"" due to the size. It was alot of money to spend to use it only for 60 days."
3,"Great exersaucer, but....","I am in violent agreement with all the reviewers- it is a well made products, the adorable toys are safe, fun and amusing-and yes-it was rather difficult to assemble.It is a fantastic exersaucer-as long as the base is attached.We squeezed several good months of use so it is worth the money, but the ""walker"" conversion does *not* work well on carpet. If you use this walker on carpet, be warned-this baby tips over! I was lucky the first time my baby girl used it and attempted to walk-she tips right over and I caught the whole thing. Right then and there my husband put it in the garage, where it meets its joyous, but abrupt, demise.Just exercise caution-use it on flooring (our home is 90% carpet) and all may be well."
4,Helps me with my gout,I have been using this supplement for over a year now and I have been very happy with the results. I have never had a bad case of gout but I have had flair ups occasionally. Taking this supplement seems to have helps reduce those flair ups. I have not had one in almost a year.
5,Happy customer,"In the mornings, I had been experiencing severe pain in my feet for more than six months; occassionally waking me up at night. I spoke with my doctor, ran some blood tests and discovered I have high uric acid. I had read dark cherry extract could help reduce uric acid levels; my doctor also believed this to be true. My doctor said the best way to obtain the benefit is (obviously) eating the raw dark cherries. I am not a fan of cherries and thought I would try a supplement before forcing myself down the other path.I purchased a small bottle of a competing brand locally almost two months ago. I have not had pain since three days after taking the dark cherry extract supplement. Since then, I have purchased the Source Naturals Cherry Fruit extract with the same results and reduced cost. YMMV, but I am very happy with this product."
1,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews for this product, I was cautiously optimistic that it would alleviate at least some of my knee pain due to arthritis. I have taken the maximum dosage - two pills three times a day - for almost a month now and can see no improvement or change at all. I am disappointed, but not terribly surprised. Perhaps if I were to continue to use it for several months there might be some benefit, but at this point I feel it would be a waste of money."
2,Better price doesn't mean better deal,"Long term medications caused me to have gout. I saw this product and thought the price was better than GNC's, but after using it for two weeks the gout returned. Going back to the GNC brand, the gout symptoms once again were almost nothing and the pain went from a 10 back down to 2. This product may work for some, but not for me. I would not recommend this to anyone that had gout."
3,Hurting knees,"It seems to be working a little. It may be due to my condition might be to severe for it to do any more, or that I was just hoping that it would help I am just thinking that it is."
2,"May work for some, but not for me...","After reading so many positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I have had gout for over 10 years now and there are times when I cannot stand or put any weight on my foot during a flare up and the pain is immense.When I initially started using this product, I did notice I felt better, however after a few days I started to get pains in my chest/abdomen after taking these pills. I am not sure if I am just too sensitive or something, but it no longer makes my feet feel any better or anything. I have even tried taking 2 - 3 pills at once like some people on here have mentioned, and still no relief.I am not saying this product does not work, just saying it doesn't work for me (at least not after the initial usage)."
1,Das Captial for Dummies,"Just another book promoting the same old ideas of the twentieth century. If you are knew to political philosophy, or philosophy in general, this book will be easier to understand than Das Capital.But for the love of humanity, remember the millions of dead bodies spread throughout the world, the result of popular leaders spreading these ideas.Of course, for those of us who have had to deal with Communism in school, on TV, movies, news, etc... this book is a good look into the mind of the newest generation of zombies to graduate with a humanities degree. Karl Marx would be proud."
2,Cheap,It's a Cheap cutter. What should you expect? I probably recommend spending more on a good cutter. Think about it; you spend good money on cigars. So you should have a good cutter!!
4,One drawback...,"This product works great. The only drawback is that on certain cigars it doesn't completely pull out the punched area. It does remove the wrapper all the time, and has yet to crack the cigar up the side like other punches have in the past!"
4,Great for anywhere!,"I got this for my son, 12 months old, and he loves it. The buttons on the phone change sounds with each of the 6 settings. It is small enough to throw in the diaper bag or give to him to play with while taking a long ride in the car."
2,IT BROKE!!,"I got this for my son when he was about 5mos old. It took him a while to warm up to it because the sound was too soft. You can only hear it when you hold it right up to your ear. But when he did start to play with it he really really liked it! Sadly, the toy broke after only one month. I do not know if his slobber ruined the toy or if it is defective but it started to just repeat the same sound over and over and over, only one light would blink and the sound became so soft you can not hear it even when you play it next to your ear. So I changed the battery, sadly only the sound was corrected. I hope that others have more luck with this toy because when it was working my son loved it."
3,Very low sound,"This toy is fun and entertaining - but the sound volume is so incredibly low! I spent about 15 minutes reading the manual because I was sure there must be a volume adjustment button somewhere, but there isn't! I guess for parents who don't want their kids to have noisy toys this is a bonus, but you can't even hear what's being said. It's a shame because otherwise it's a good toy."
4,perfect for first birthday...,"This was a great choice for a first birthday present! Our grandchild loves it, and imitates his mom to both his and her delight."
5,Great Toy,We bought this toy so my 11 month old daughter would stop trying to play with our real phone. She absolutley loves it! There are several modes to play in and the tunes and lights are fun and catchy. She has thrown it across the floor several times and it just keeps on playing.
4,Great purchase,I purchased this phone for my 1 year old since she LOVES phones. This kept her occupied for a few mins at a time. She liked pushing the buttons to change the pictures till the mirror showed up. The buttons are easy to push but the phone it self is pretty heavy (I think). I wouldn't say it is a must have but it is a great toy.
4,"Grandaughter absolutely loves, but...","My 11 month old granddaughter loves this phone. She threw iton the floor quite a few times the first 2 hrs she had it, and it stopped saying part of the phrase ""let's call a friend, hello is that you?"" It has stopped saying ""hello is that you?"" I was a bit put off with how fragile this phone was. All the other buttons work fine. It found it a bit large, but at her age she can hold it just fine. The voice speaking is very clear and easy to understand."
2,very disappointed,"We bought this toy for our one year old. Our hope was that it would entertain her on her first plane ride. The toy kept her attention for about three minutes. The volume was so low (even on the higher setting) that it couldn't be heard over the noise of the plane. She wouldn't play with it when we reached our destination either. Maybe the volume was defective, but the toy wasn't what I was hoping for."
3,Too big for little hands,"My son loves phones so we bought this one, but this phone is just too big and a bit heavy to enjoy. It would have been so much better if it was smaller and thinner so he could easily hold it. He does play with it but it is not his favorite."
5,One of the Greatest Toys,"Our daughter, like probably 99.997% of children, is fixated with our phones be it cordless or mobile. Of course the danger of playing with the real thing ranges from damaging the phone to expensive bills for unintended phone calls to Kathmandu. Fortunately, after reading some of the other bills we bought this Vtech kids phone. It is one of the favorite toys for our daughter. It has 2 modes (talking and music) and 2 volume levels (usually we have it set on the lower). The buttons will emit sounds that she sometimes tries to imitate or music in the music mode. She has a great time pushing the different buttons or switches and getting a response and then alternatively holding it up to her hear like a real phone. With plenty of toys that elicit hardly a response, this one is a real winner and one of the few that I would heartily recommend."
3,great!,"w have been using the book ever since we got it... we really like it, it seems a little bit old, the pics are like from the 60s but is the type of content that won't change on 50 years..."
1,Big disappointment,It was not very romantic at all. It was tastefully done but it is only interesting if you wish to get into the massage business.
3,The Art of Sensual Massage,"This book was interesting to read...there were some good techniques in it, however, the pictures were definitely dated. I didn't find them particularly helpful, and some of the instructions for massage techniques were hard to follow. The first chapters were informative, as they gave some tips and procedures for massage. Overall, there are probably better books out there. It's not exactly what I was expecting..."
1,70's,"I returned this item as soon as I received it. If you are looking for something to stimulate you and your spouse in the bedroom, keep looking. If you're looking for a good laugh at the 70's, enjoy."
1,Why pay this price?,"I don't understand charging $19.99 for this ebook, when it's in the public domain and available free both from Amazon and Project Gutenberg. That said, it's a sweet old-fashioned love story."
5,Cosmological view with excellent section on nakshatra's,"Bepin Behari is actually my *favorite* author. His profound spiritual insights are unmatched in modern Jyotisha literature. However, Behari is not for everyone. He is not a literalist. He treats some Vedic subjects as metaphors. You have to already like the theosophical cosmology to appreciate Behari's genius. To literalists, Behari can be irritating. Also, normally, Behari's prosaic Indian English writing style makes for cumbersome reading. However this particular volume is skillfully edited by the eminent American Jyotishi, David Frawley. Excellent section on nakshatra's. Behari's powerful theosophical cosmology shines through quite readable, uplifting prose. I recommend Myths and Symbols of Vedic Astrology to any cosmologically inclined beginner-to-advanced English-reading Jyotishi."
4,Silky smooth,"When I first ordered these strings, I didn't receive the B string. I sent 'em back, got in a new pair in a timely manner, and threw 'em on immediately.These strings are very smooth. The coating makes them feel closer to flatwounds, but they aren't quite there. So, be aware they're a little dead, and they probably don't need to be broken in before they're show ready. All I had to do was adjust the treble a bit on my bass and my Mesa.If you use a pick, and you want your strings to stay red, DO NOT get these. There is one song my band does where I use a pick, but after playing it, I noticed my E string was missing a lot of red where I was striking it.The red up on the frets is wonderful and has shown no fading as of yet, and on a black bass with gold plated hardware, I can I vouch for the visual appeal."
5,This is the book I use most.,"I count 6 MS Access books on my shelf at work. If I could only have one, it would be this one. I find information that I haven't found in any of the others. It's also the best reference on Access SQL. I'm in the process of developing from a casual access user to professional level, and have lots of questions."
2,Paper Weight,Probably the worst index I have ever seen in a programmer's reference. I really don't want to have to read the entire book to find that there is little or nothing on a particular topic of interest. These 958 pages make a great paperweight.
2,Rusted in the box!,"It rusted while still in the plastic bad inside of the box! Very thin gauge metal and even thinner paint. Probably doesn't even have a primer coat of paint. This will be used on an outside porch, so I have to clean it, prime and re-paint it before even using it."
3,Corner Plant Stand,"I like the size and shape of this stand but the quality was bit disappointing. The middle shelf's pre-drilled hole was way off that I had to call customer service up for a replacement piece. They told me that they couldn't just send the piece that I had to pack it all up and wait for a new package to arrive. It was a very quick re-delivery but the second one was so dusty/dirty that I had to clean up first. Then, this time the pre-drilled hole was in correct position but one of the metals was bended, and something off that it's not flat(has slight curve to it) so if I put a plant towards the edge, it will slide off from the shelf. Obviously I wasn't happy with this one either but I didn't want to wait for another one to find out different problem so I'm keeping it. Anyway, the color is rich black that It works well with our light green wall in our patio. Hope you don't get a defective one like I did."
1,no good,I don't know why but when this is in use the picture on my lcd monitor is horrible. As soon as I take this product out of the path the picture is fine. I tested with 2 computers. The switching works well but who wants to look at a blurry screen?
2,Turkey of all Sea Disaster Movies,"Improbable storyline, cheesy dialogue. This movie is in many ways a cult classic. Emma Samms made this movie right before she landed on General Hospital as Holly and she is utterly breathtaking in this film. A waste of a highly talented cast. Still a fun Saturday Night Cult Film."
3,Goliath Awaits still waiting!,"I was extremely disappointed with the video copy of ""Goliath Awaits"". The original movie - I believe it was made for television - was more detailed. The video, in fact, deletes an entire section about the importance of the documents that went down on the Goliath and the U.S. senator that went down with the ship. It leaves a blank space in the film. I wish they had left it alone and made the video the same as the film version. The story is interesting and with the fairly recent discovery of the Titanic time relevant. What if someone had survived underwater? I honestly not sure that whoever edited this film actually watched it first. Bad editing of the plot gives this a 3."
2,Too Short,"The movie was a very good undersea drama that was 3 hours and 20 minutes long. ""Showtime"" and ""The Movie Channel"" used to run this movie in it's full length with a break in the middle. The VHS and Laserdisc versions of this movie have been cut and edited so poorly it ruins the movie. This movie should be released in it's full length. (Maybe they will do it for DVD). Let's hope so. I rated it a two only because of the bad editing in the Video. The movie itself get's a Five!"
5,Amazing music that amazes,"Of Walker's 4 numbered albums, this is consistently the best. From the opening blast of the world-weary Brel epic ""Jackie"" to the closing tones of ""Come Next Spring"" this is an album full of musical gems, hidden treasures, and astoundingly tender wonders. I don't know what I love more - the Sinatra meets Wagner swell of ""Best of Both Worlds,"" the lounge-folk of ""Black Sheep Boy,"" or the sheer, mournful beauty of ""Window's of the World."" This album surges from the ridiculous to the sublime without flinching, all the while carried along by breathtakingly stunning production. The only song that overstays its welcome is ""Plastic Palace People,"" though even that has some memorable moments. The previous album, though good, suffered from pacing/song-selection issues, the later albums, each briliant in its own way, tend to be overly experimental. This is the one (although it's called 2)."
4,"Not his best, but worth getting.","Scott 2 features some great songs, but as some other reviews have said, many tracks are mismatched. The cd will feature high moments of craft and lyricism, as in all the Brel covers (naturally), Windows of the World, and Plastic Palace Alice. The other songs are forgettable and just too soupy to get into. Personally, other than the songs listed, I can only recall Best of Both Worlds only for the fact that the opening notes match Dvorak's New World Symphony.But, though forgettable, the other tracks aren't offensive or unlistenable. And the majority of other songs make up for them to keep you listening to the cd the whole way through. And all serves as a harbinger for great albums to come, namely Scott 4."
4,Cry yourself to sleep with a smile on your face,I read this book after seeing a recommendation and I wasn't dissappointed. This sweet little book tells the events of three very unique characters and explores their struggles in life told in a very amusing style. I'm particularly fond of the art in the book: simple yet effective. Pick up this book and cry yourself to sleep with it!
2,I wasn't going to review the product because all the reviews were good and ....,"I bought this product based upon the reviews. I looked at the chart cross-eyed for about a month, but didn't notice any long term improvement at all. I gave up."
5,Turtles,This cute little one loves turtles in all forms... this is the perfect turtle storybook for a little one who loves colorful books and ready to learn how to read... Perfect
1,Avoid!,"Just bought these a few weeks ago (12 stakes total - 3 sets) for a trip to Joshua Tree, CA. Just returned, in the semi-hard desert sand ALL of them started bending when tapped in (using rubber mallet first, then hammer). 8 of them bent 90 degrees at the head. Ended up using the smaller, standard stakes that came with the tent. Very disappointed, as the standard stakes with the plastic tops snap easily as well, but at least the metal parts remain straight and still usable."
5,"Great book! No extra words, just the information you need","This book has become the most ragged and dog-eared in my collection. It is a reference book that simply gives commands, example calls, what the delimiters are, and how to use it. A great tool. You wont find much theory here, but it serves as a good syntax reference."
1,BUYER BEWARE,This product is terrible. It was given to me as engagement gift by my parents and after one month it stopped cooling in the top chamber. After getting a replacement unit - the new unit is now also no working. My dad also had problems with his. We have gone through 4 of these things. Haier should be ashamed selling defective products like this. I will never buy another Haier product ever again...
3,Everything Except Counting,"Just about the entire book deals withthe history, casinos, terminology, sidebets, and the like. Fortunately thereis some info on basic strategy and anunbalanced count, but don't expect thisbook to prepare you to take on the casinos.An interesting read for those with apassing interest in BJ, or for a brandnew student of the game."
1,Do not purchase this thing,"I just received my Pelouze PS 5 DL postage scale unit.I first found out that to load the USPS rate tables in it you must use the old serial port connections.Most new computers do not have the DB 9 connectors on them (this is at least 10 years old).I had to purchase a serial to USB converter.I next spent almost two hours trying to find the stinking site that is supposed to download the rate table, the site that the instructions direct you to does not work.I never did find it and gave up. I went on line and found a site that allows me to print out the rates and then with the scale I can figure out the postage for the mail.I strongly advise everyone that wants to have a unit that will calculate the postage DO NOT BUY this thing. It works as a standalone scale but not as a calculator of rates."
1,Typo in the Russian portion of the title makes one wonder...,Typo in the Russian text on the cover of this book is a dead give-away about its quality. Avoid this book.
2,Pale Peridot,"The peridot bracelet I ordered came and I was very disappointed to find the stones were not at all like the photo. They are very pale and watery looking, hard to see that they were green. The design is wonderful, quality is good and it came promptly, but I am going to return it because I will never be happy with the nearly colorless stones. It came from Peora, SKU sb2864.Flo Philips"
5,Faith in 2000,"It's hard to capture the energy of a DJ set on a cd, but I feel Mars & Mystre have done a great job representing their sound on Faith in 2000. Anyone who loves trance and has not experienced M&M, under the lasers, laying down the most blissful dance music of this century, needs to get themselves to an F8 party. Experience the music with them as your guides personally and you'll appreciate the cd that much more."
3,Very Happy Trance,I have to admit that the first CD is a bit bland and the version of John Lennons Imagine is well... silly... [stuff]... ridiculous. However the CD is saved by the brilliance of the rest of disk 2. Espeacialy good is every morning with Mark Sinclair. Otherwise the tracks have this rare optomism. Very different from the like of Sasha and Digweed or some Oakenfold with the dark feel to them. This is pure happy bubblegum trance for lack of better descriptions.
2,I found it disorganized,"I'm more experienced in print design, Photoshop and Illustrator are now old friends, so I expect to climb a steep learning curve with a program like Dreamweaver. However, this book is not proving a great travelling companion. I have found many, many examples of tutorials not working according to the explanations. It's unsettling in a way no other program guide i've tried has been. It feels like they skipped the proofreader stage. The actual projects are good, the design of the web page is quite nice and that's what attracted me to the book. Now I'm just struggling through it to get my money's worth since I can't get my money back!"
3,Prett Good Product.,I fits great with the Zune and works great in the car. the only problem is they say there is a remote to change it so you don't have to look at it while you are driving but it never came with one! :(Otherwise besides that it was great!
3,Not the best of Doo Wop,"Not bad, just not the great songs you hear on the radio or on a PBS special. Unless you are really into Doo Wop, I would buy a collection with more hits in it."
5,Just great.,"I found this book a little too cliche for me in the beginning, because I did not know what to expect from it (I received it as a present). But then I thought it was great, the off-beat humor mixed warmly with what you really need to know to be successful. On top of that, this book managed to take my depression elsewhere.Good job Donn M. Davis, you really put a lot of thought into this one."
1,Do you know where your cheese is?,"At the end of this tome is a list of accomplishments which the author asserts makes you a successful ""modern"" man. Well, if owning a fancy watch and a sports car says you've arrived then, shucks, call me old-fashioned. I'd rather spend my cash on what matters to me and not in a vain attempt to fit into Mr. Davis' pompous circle of phonies.The problem with the rat race is, even if you win, you're still a rat. And, oh yeah, *I* moved your cheese!"
4,A great gift for a guy,"OK, so there may be more to being a guy than can fit into 40 or so short lessons, but this book makes it easier to master(or at least fake effectively) some of key skills that a guy should have these days. I enjoyed getting some straight advice on buying a diamond from someone wasn't trying to sell me one. And now I won't have to panic every time I try to tie my bow tie. You may not be able to learn everything you need to know from this or any book, but for those of us whose dads didn't quite show them every rope, this one comes in handy."
1,Don't Buy This,Worked fine until I dropped it on the driveway. Then cracked open. Guess I'll get a brass one next time.
1,No good,"The rear legs are not set back as far as they need to be, with a younger child (18 - 19 months) climbing around on the chair, it is very easy to tip over backwards."
4,A brass blast with Bach,"This is a uptempo version of Art of Fugue, no doubt about that. Yet, contrary to one other reviewer, there are other versions that fit the length of one CD, albeit still taking more than 60 minutes. (Fretwork's version for a consort of viols comes in just under the 80-minute mark, for example.)That said, at this speed, some movements just don't ""breathe"" enough, even if Bach may have had fast tempos in his own time. But, the sounds of brass quintet on a piece like this, in addition to the tempos, make this a welcome addition to a collections of multiple Arts."
4,Going into his presence!,Shipping too much longer than expected but I was just glad to get the prayer shawl. I am so excited about using it. They even sent an extra gift. Thank you! May God continue to bless you and I look forward to you possibly serving me in the future!
5,pray shaw,I use this pray shaw in prayer daily. I feel like the hand s of the LOrd are upon me and all around me in prayer.
5,Beautiful!,"I honestly didn't know what to think about this product, by ordering it via of Amazon (no offense Amazon); however, I am so happy with my Tallis Prayer Shawl. Its beautiful....and very well made. The details are amazing and I would difinetly recommed this to family and friends."
4,Adult Romance- not a kids tale!,"Adult romance! 2 mature people set in their ways, successful in their careers- can they make room for love? THis one starts on a LOVE BOAT tour to Mexico then shifts to La Jolla and the southland in southern California.YOUR PLACE OR MINE - Vicki Lewis ThompsonLila Kedge(45): Divorced mother of two with an all-consuming real estate business -- and no room for romance.Bill Windsor(48): A daredevil type with Paul Newman looks, and a passion for race-car driving. He lived hard and fast.A shipboard fling with Bill was the last thing stressed-out Lila needed on her Mexican cruise. But it was the ultimate temptation -- should she resist this blue-eyed charmer whose touch made her feel so much a woman? On board, the answer waseasy; on land, Bill was just an unwanted complication. He'd never settle for the white-picket-fence routine. She'd never get used to race-car circuits. Somehow they had to meet halfway..."
5,Best Collection EVER of her hits!!,"Where else can you find a CD album of her duet with Barry Manilow..""Run to Me""!! Imagine..both artists on Arista Records in the late 80's and this song was only available on a 45 single !! Never released by either artist, including, believe it or not, a duets album on Arista. I'm a deejay and owned an FM AC station in Michigan in the late 80's and played this song religiously and had a great response from our listening audience! I consider this single along with ""Don'T Talk"" by Larry Lee of Ozark Mountain Daredevils and ""Words"" by F.R. David to be 3 of the rarest songs to find on CD. Also on this album is ""All the Love in the World""..another great single by Dionne with background harmonies from Barry Gibb. BUY THIS ALBUM.!!"
4,i am looking for....,"this is a great selection, but i am still searching for her recording of ""Loneliness Remembers"" and ""Knowing when to Leave,"" which was from the musical Promises, Promises. Any suiggestions out there?"
3,Not what I was hoping for....,"I almost purchased this book because it looked really good but found it at the library first. I am glad I did not purchase this book because I was expecting tips on how to help my kids. I did not really find this at all. It was just stories and stories and stories of kids in school.Okay, so I get the stories and it did bring me back to my painful childhood and school memories but what are your suggestions to me to help my children be successful and confident in school and in life now?Even the last Wisdom chapter did not give anything to really help.Not was I expected."
2,Not that useful and fast to point the finger.,"Yet another book where little actual advice or new ideas are presented. It takes over 200 pages to say that we should listen to our children and hear them speak in a free and open way.I did not want to read 100 little examples and stories of Michaels encounters over his career, I wanted real ideas how to help Kids dealing with a stressful environment.Michaels fails to deliver, the promise in the title ""Helping your child find success in school and life."" I found no real help, no real advice. In fact it reads like a promo for his services rather than a guide to assisting a child.It is not nice to write such a harsh review of a book where someone is trying to help, but I feel he places far too much blame without offering real solutions, and that there are some much better books covering the topic."
4,A Good Read For Parents,"Michael Thompson's book is an informative read for parents and provides readers with many examples of the struggles children go through throughout their school lives. He points out the differences in all children and reminds readers of the importance of identifying with the student and allowing that child to make mistakes and learn from those mistakes. Thompson also offers his ""best wisdom"" and outlines five of the most important things he has learned from students. Parts of this list include a description of how students are always searching for success, that students crave a reciprocal relationship with adults and how students want to feel useful in the classroom.Overall, this is a useful book for parents to read to gain an understanding of the development process in children and possibly identify with other struggling students."
3,"High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games, Second Edition (Paperback)",Not a huge difference from the first version. Still has great info of history and lore...who knows what really is true and what is just stories. Definitely worth a read for any video game enthusiast...Book is so huge and lots of pretty pictures in case you get tired of reading...perfect balance...Definitely worth a look if you are into game history at all...
3,"Fun, horribly incomplete","A great coffee table book, but if you're looking for an accurate history, look elsewhere. While they did a pretty good job on golden age stuff, the way the book is written implies the arcades completely disappeared around 1985.One of the most glaring omissions is Street Fighter 2, a game that single-handedly revived the arcade market in the early '90s. Clearly the authors aren't fighting game fans as they gave SF2 only two measly pages while they gave SSI (the company) six. Nor do they give much attention to the other successful fighting games of the 90s, such as Samurai Showdown, King of Fighters and Mortal Kombat.Two whole pages for a game that revived an entire market and basically created the competitive fighting game genre?I guess as Dr. Evil would say: ""Riiiiiight."""
3,good...,i am doing a project that needs an outline. it would help if this was in chronoligical order...duke nukem after dreamcast? geez...
2,Poor quality,"This book is filled with inaccuracies. I know that it can be difficult to seperate myth and legend from historical fact when it comes to the history of electronic gaming. For example, look at the variations of the story of Pong in Andy Capp's bar. Unfortunately, even some of the captions next to pictures are wrong.If you're looking for a book about the history of electronic gaming, I recommend The Ultimate History of Video Games (ISBN 0-7615-3643-4) by Steven L. Kent. However, inaccuracies aside, this book is good as a visual aid to supplement Kent's book. This book is filled with pictures, while Kent's book is filled with text.Also, do not expect this book to have a very long lifespan. It is glue bound and the pages will start to fall out after repeated use."
4,Ok for light use,"I read several reviews that stated this it is flimsy and I brought it anyway. It holds regular sized books and serves my purpose, but for large and heavy textbooks it is not sturdy enough."
5,Fellowes 21140 Booklift Copyholder,"Great product for the money, holds a heavy medical book well, prompt delivery.. would have preferred beige color but did not see as available.I'm a happy customer... Celia, Miramar Florida"
1,BOOK HOLDER INEFFECTIVE,BOOK HOLDER INADEQUATE FOR HOLDING BOOK WITH PAGES SUFFICIENTLY HELD IN PLACE. ITEM RETURNED
1,Bad Choice,I bought the item but have been very dissapointed. The books can't hold. I have to find something that works.
3,Does not hold large textbooks. Same piece breaks over and over.,"I've owned about 3 of these so far. There is a little tab in the back that inserts into a hole where you select the height of the stand. The little tab bears ALL of the weight of the book & stand, and it is plastic along with the rest of the unit.I keep crazy glueing the tab back, and it continues to work for a while, but it's frustrating. There is another clipboard/bookstand out there called the ""easy reader"", which is a little more pricey and heavier, but infinitely more sturdy. It might have been discontinued too.I really don't understand why they don't make the part that has the tab metal. If they did, the stand would last a whole lot longer, and would hold bigger books. As a medical student, I need it to hold larger textbooks, and it doesn't do the job. It works well for smaller books."
2,Doesn't fold out - flimsy clips,I thought this was metal. It's plastic. The clips at the bottom are flimsy. The way they took this photo it looks as if the book holder will open up but it doesn't. They just formed the plastic so it would look as if it would fold out in the photo. What a rip off.
5,Wonderful,"This book holder can hold ""everything."" From small to big, nothing poses a challenge. My only wish is that the book holder could be a little wider so that the covers don't hang off the edge--but it's not a big issue, especially if the book is a hardcover. Another neat feature, which I haven't seen on other book holders, is the page holder prongs.The prongs move up and down; this means you will not have to weave each page in and out of the prongs in order to turn the page; simply push the prong down, flip the page, and push the prongs back up. Easy. No fear of ripping pages when turning them. These page-holding prongs are also very strong. They will keep even the smallest paperback open."
4,Review of Fellowes Copyholder,"Sometimes it's the little things that matter most. I purchased this bookholder to help me with studies in school.This gem is light, folds flat, and has notebook holes that allow it to fit into the most crowded bookbag without adding a lot of additional weight. It folds/unfolds easily and can hold my 3 inch thick textbooks. At times it seems that the bookholder will buckle under the weight, but it never does. It has pins that come up should you need it to hold a page open, but I rarely use that feature. This is one of the least expensive things I've purchased to help with school that has made the biggest impact on my studies (crazy!). This could be used to hold up other kinds of books - cookbooks, etc and is convenient enough to be transported into a bedroom, office, kitchen, whereever. Definitely worth it."
3,"Efficient Service, but Mediocre Product","The booklift was very useful while it remained intact, but it broke after a semester's worth of use. It arrived in good condition, but was not as durable as described."
3,okay but could be better,"The quality of material and sturdiness are a bit lacking given the cost of the item. The plastic pegs in front that hold pages down rotate up and down pop off easily (the pegs have rods on each side that are pressed (pressure fit) into plastic clamps. Similarly the two rubber feet on the adjustable back part that props up the stand are not that secure (one of the disappeared at some point in time). You have a single page or a few loose pages then one or two tend to slip down in the crack between the bottom (1 inch wide horizontal) support and the main vertical support. Additionally, the most vertical position is not as vertical as I would like.In sum the general plasticky and non-integrity of the product makes me think I should be able to buy a better stand for the same price (or make one)."
4,"Plastic, but seems durable...","I agree with the other reviewers who said that even though this book holder is plastic and feels cheap, it does a good job holding even very heavy books. It has no problem holding one of my hardback textbooks that has 1,716 pages and weighs 6 pounds. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think it would be more reliable over the long haul if it were metal."
5,Serves Its Purpose Well,"I've only had this for a short time, but it works very well. Although it looks and feels like it might be a little flimsy, it held a volume of the Tax Code (which weights about 4.5 pounds!) open with no problem. Also works well with large textbooks. This is the first time that I've tried a book rest, and its really a big help. Bottom line is that as long as this doesn't break anytime soon, its a great product. Oh, and its also very light and portable. Very easy to put in a bag or briefcase."
3,"It's ""Alright""","This product certainly isn't designed for *large* textbooks as it claims. I have an nearly 800-page book, and this book holder tries and succeeds masterfully at not being adequate for the job. If it wasn't so cheap, I'd send it back. Frankly, I think the price must be the only reason it's gotten a good rating at all. It needs to be rated for medium-size textbooks, not large."
2,Not useful,"This product will not hold a book open. It is sturdy enough as a prop, so if your book lies flat this will do. It will hold open a magazine like National Geographic, but it will hold open neither the beginning pages of a large textbook, nor any page of a trade paperback.I bought it to hold open medium-sized Latin and Greek books for me while I translate. It simply can't do it.I can see where it might be convenient here and there for a few things. It is not a serious tool."
4,Good Product,"This product works really well. Its able to hold my organic book which is huge! If your looking for a stand that will hold heavy/large books this is the book stand for you. It also has page holders, it can fold up so you can put it away."
3,Attempts to cover everything...,"The book covers all aspect of Flip Charts, starting from what sort of paper to use, type of markers, drawing stick figures and smileys with character and ending with how to store your charts and how to construct a flip-chart stand. It's a good book if you've just decided to 'do something' with flip-charts. However, it's as useful or not as much of a reference for the experienced user.For the more experienced user who's looking for more advanced techniques and ideas, I suggest 'The Big Book of Flip Charts' by Robert W. Lucas. If you need help in the 'art' department (in other words. If you can't draw a flower to save your life), consider 'A Picture's Worth 1,000 Words : A Workbook for Visual Communications' by Jean Westcott and Jennifer Hammond."
4,good resource,Ordered this to help me as a Weight Watcher leader. Found it helpful and referred to it often as I made my flip charts for meetings.
4,A vintage reference on flip charting,"Brandt's book has been around for over a decade, but provides creative and insightful information on the topic of flip charts."
4,It got the job done,"All in all this worked for me. One thing that was difficult was trying to get the water bottle back in place while the pack was still on. The pack was comfortable to wear, it holds quite a bit. As far as accessing items inside the pockets I had to take the pack off which wasn't a problem for me but might be for others."
2,Almost,This might have worked for me if the waistband straps were better designed. Seemed like the clips provided to hold excess strap material would not do the job. Returned and still looking.
5,Great Pack,I took this hiking in the woods on a trip in the smokey mountains. It is a great hip pack and holds everything I needed for a day trip. Sturdy.
2,water bottle contains BPA,"Very nice quality otherwise but the water bottles contain BPA, which was not listed on the description and well after the BPA hazard became widely known."
1,not that good,It looks nice on the web but it doesn't sit right. I got a lumbar fanny pack at Wal-mart for $9.98 that works better. I was hoping to like it and use it on our Disneyland trip but it never panned out. Some people love it and that is great that it works well for them. To each their own.
4,Great pack for motorcycle riding,"Even though it is a bit bigger than I am used to, it's very well manufactured and with plenty of space. I will never have to use another bag again. I use it mainly while riding my motorcycle where I have to carry the essential and still have them available without problems. This little (big) bag is just what I needed."
1,BULKY AND UNEVEN WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION,"I am always looking for the perfect hip pack. I do a lot of long distance walking and need at least 2 water bottles and a place for 'stuff' along the way that will see me through hours of exercise. This pack seemed perfect by the description. I knew my first time out it would sit on the shelf. It is very bulky and kept falling forward, making it awkward. It was relatively well made but so off balance in the design that it's not even good for a short hike. It did hold what I needed but I'll never use it again. That, then, also makes it too pricey."
3,Worked OK,"The High Sierra Lumbar Pack looked great out of the box, but on the first wearing one of the zipper pullies snapped right off making opening and closing a bit difficult. The bag carries quite a bit and worked for my Disneyland trip, but the zippers do not zip smoothly, its an ok bag, but for the price it should have been made better!"
3,Not great for hiking.,This daypack is just ok. It pulls away from you when you have water bottle(s) in it and I found I had to let it rest on my rear end. I'll invest in a camelback for next time we go on a hike.
5,perfect size,"I was looking for a good day hiking fanny pack that could hold several things, since I'm often hiking with my 3 kids. This is perfect. It can hold a couple bottles of water and some snacks, a camera, my phone and keys. Looking forward to using it soon!"
4,Yes and No,"These are incredibly cute on and make my feet look really small; however, they hurt the ball of my feet like crazy after more than an hour of wearing them. So far, I'm suffering through b/c of the way they look!"
4,KEY TRACK IS MISSING,"This is a great collection, however, please be advised that a key track (and one of the best rock songs ever written) is missing. ""Stone in Love"" from the Escape album. Very good except for this omission."
4,There is a bonus track #16.,"My CD is indicated to be 2006. It is a soft pack with a drawer for the CD. Assuming I have the right CD identification, Amazon has left off the bonus track in their listing. The track is ""When You Love a Woman"". And I see it in an image provided by a another individual."
5,My favorite CD,"This CD is a must for any fan of Journey, or 80's music in general. I have been a huge fan of Journey for years, and this CD showcases the absolute best that Journey has to offer. If I had to pick my 5 favorite songs on the album, I would probably say ""Don't Stop Believin"",""Faithfully"", ""Be Good to Yourself"", ""Ask the Lonely"", and ""Seperate Ways"". However, that does not mean that I do not like all the songs either. I love every song, and this is probably the only CD I own that I do not have to skip tracks on. The tempo and rythm is different in each song, but they are all equally enjoyable. All the songs also sound like they did when they were originally released. There is no new or ""remixed"" versions made especially for the greatest hits CD.Journey is a group that was way ahead of their time, and they managed to offer a variety of enjoyable music. Overall, Journey's""Greatest Hits"" album is my favorite CD of all time, and I still listen to it on a regular basis.A solid 5 stars..."
1,Worthless,"More faceless, worthless arena rock from the late70's/early 80's. Along with Styx, and REO Speedwagon, Journey represens the worst of a painfully bad genre, with each being fronted with a really bad lead singer whose vocals are even less pleasant than nails being raked across a chlakboard."
1,Perfect Album To Soak Your Tears On.....,"just make sure you don't electricute yourself in the process. Most overated garbage to play to your love one, or even get laid to. This album collects a lot of dust on the shelf in my home. Oh I must remind you, also a good album to get dumped with. Sorry folks, but this group up to this point got too much airplay, which made them a commercial hell for the rest of the years Steve Perry was in the picture. But if you like MENTOs type music, run out and get this one, it will ease your sick mind.Was this review helpful to you?"

1,how did i used to like this crap,"There was a time in like early 2003 or so i was in to music like this and def leapard, foreigner, the scorpins and so on so this cd was decent then and also i manily bought it for open arms now a guilty pleasure acutally when i bought this cd at best buy i was ashamed of it. But later in the year i got into alt rock and indie and got bored with stuff like this and the other stuff they play on classic rock radio to death. Who cares if perry has a a good voice so does josh gorban but when you songs suck and have no orginality who cares i acutally pefer someone like tom waites who has a crappy voice simply because he is a great songwriter and he experiments something this band never did.By the way i still like open arms when it comes on the radio i plug in my headphones and listen and feel ashamed to even listen to it"
4,journey greatest hits,One of the best cds i have listened to for a very long time. thank you very very much R.W.
5,Good Music!!!,"I really enjoyed all of Journey's c.d.'s. I really started listening to them when Nick Carter (I'm a huge BSB fan and I love Nick Carter) said that Journey was a big influence on his singing career. I have grown to like Journey, and if you don't really care for them now, do me and all of the other Journey fans and go listen to that music. THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -katie ;)"
4,"tastes great, less filling","One of the great, middle-of-the-road 'B' bands of the 70s and 80s (along with REO Speedwagon and Foreigner) Journey will never make it into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or be remembered as innovators. But it doesn't matter since their success spans over three decades, and some of the band's biggest singles are still being covered by today's pop acts (i.e. Britney has done 'Open Arms' - ha that sounds funny but it's true.) Perry is an amazing vocalist and they got a little arty on 'Wheel in the Sky.' Give them credit for writing catchy songs that may last longer than their critics once claimed."
4,Journey Rocks!,"You've gotta love Steve Perry. His hard driving, heartfelt voice make every sappy lyric profound and significant. What girl wouldn't just melt hearing him sing ""And now that you've come back/turned night into day/I need you to stay"". It's the stuff junior high dances are made of.Yes, all the old favorites are there and some you might have forgotten about. All the songs are spread around pretty nicely, though it does chart the progression of Journey as a group to the inevitable mid-80s It's-Steve's-Show-and-You're-Lucky-He-Lets-You-Rock-Out-With-Him period. The soaring guitar solos are an incredible compliment to Perry's voice and are a testiment to the accomplished musicianship of the group. But, come on. Don't you vaguely suspect that those other guys would have spent the last 20 years playing airport Hilton's had it not been for the arena-rocking, palavar-spewing Perry? It might be sappy corporate rock, but it's the sweetest and most endearing of the bunch."
5,Two Generations of Journey Lovers Now,"I'm pushing 40 and have loved Journey from their beginning. But getting this CD has created a new generation of Journey lovers, my 10 and 12 year old daughters! They demand I play the Journey CD in the car and jam out to ""Any Way You Want"". Not to mention, the bonus track of ""When You Love a Woman"" prompted us to buy the sheet music so we can play and sing it on the piano. This is an amazing collection of Journey at its best. A must have for any Journey fan and a great way to introduce Journey to those that haven't seen the light yet."
5,So glad I bought it!!!,I knew that I would like this CD before I ever got it. I already loved all the songs.
4,Good compilation.,Good compilation of old and new hits. Sound quality was great. Even on the old songs. I didn't want to buy a bunch of albums. This set has a very good amount of old and new.
5,Great!!,"Took me 20 yrs to buy it but better late than never. It's great, in great shape, and arrived lightning fast. Thanks!"
4,MEMORIES,This CD brought back the memories of tunes which I do not hear on the radio as often as I would like. Thank you for this.
2,Decent,Decent chick band favorite of the 80s. My favorite track is Wheel in the Sky. For similar Christian metal check out Stryper or Danzig.
1,CD,I recieved an empty CD case .And Marc down ent. would not even acknowledge that I had contactated them twice. My money was promptly and courtiously refunded by Amazom.
1,the best of crap.,"Too bad you cant give negative ratings to bands like these. Music made just to make money. It is hard to beleive that Greg Rollie and Neal Schon who both came from the Santana band could make so bland music. Bands like Kansas,Styx,Blue Oyster Cult and etc dont deserve to waste the vinyl to make these albums. Start listening to some real music. Dig alot deeper then groups like these."
1,"why is this in the ""Hard Rock & Metal "" catagory?","warning, warning! you are treading on glam Territory !"
1,What is wrong with people?,"It seems that people (by people I mean College age kids, sorry) seem to only like this music because today's popular taste is backwards. People like ""the office"" because its awkward. people like Will Farrell because he's ""stupid."" People like the 80's again because their glitzy, lame and tacky. Anytime I hear ""don't stop believin'"" all I can think of is a bunch of drunk frat boy yuppies and their girlfriends in their big belts and sack dresses, yelling and screaming tone deaf lyrics in a drunken crowded stupor. Anyone who says Journey is their favorite band and is under 25 is a liar. I guarantee that any one in this age group only has the ""hot singles"" and 80's greatest hits albums. This is ridiculous."
5,A must have for any greatest hits enthusiast,"This is a fine compilation of hits from a great band, and truly epitomizes the term ""greatest hits"". This collection is just that...hits. If you are a fan of Journey, you'll love it. If you've heard one song on this collection, chances are you've heard them all. And if you haven't heard them, one listen and you'll be hooked."
5,Great Album,"I always enjoyed the Journey song ""I Believe"". I purchased this album mostly for this song. The rest of the album is great also."
2,A Little Too Flat,"Somewhat disappointed with this CD as it is not as dynamic as other Journey recordings. A burned download of Faithfully (Frontiers Album) from Walmart Downloads - then burned - blows away the dynamic range of this CD. If you are looking for a great collection of Journey songs, this CD has a good song list. If you care about dynamic range in the presentation, you may be a little unhappy. Bottom line -- the remaster is a little too flat for me."
1,Journey's greatest hits 180 g,Very disappointed. The album is very flat with no depth and voices are muddy. A total disappointment. I do not recommend this album.
2,Good music but truly awful mastering/production,"Good tracks, but if you have a reasonably high quality sound system, be warned that the digital transfer is tinny, shrill, bass free, AM-radio-sounding mess.This music makes me want to listen to Journey again, but the sound quality is driving me away. This disc is going in the trash bin in favor of the remastered ""Essential Journey"""
4,Get the Infinity album too.,"Unfortunately, it does not include my favorite song tandem Feeling That Way/ Anytime. For that you need to buy The Infinity album. It does include some great songs, a good mix of rockers and ballads. Definitely worth the price to anyone who loves classic rock and roll or was a teen in the late '70s. But do yourself a favor and get the Infinity album too."
5,Review on Journey cassette,This cassette was a Christmas for a friend and she loved it!! Thanks for the great service ! I will definitely recommend to my friend that Amazon sells cassettes :)
2,Not impressive...,"After many years, I decided to give this SACD a try. I've found better sound from ""The Essential Journey"" cd than from this Greatest hits SACD.I think there's an improvement from the original cd, but it looks like they did a lazy transfer to SACD and so, unlike ""The Essential"", the sound is not polished.I own many stereo SACD (Sychronicity-The Police, What's going on-Marvin Gaye, The best-Roxy Music, In search of the lost chord-Moody Blues) and I think all of them represent a justification for SACD upgrading. With ""Journey Greatest hits"", I frankly wasn't impressed."
3,Mixed review,"If you like ""Journey"", you'll love this edition, which is a purer, better mixed ""stereo"" version of the album. This is not a multi-channel recording! Unfortunately, some SACD's were remixed in stereo only (2.1 basically - 2 channels and the subwoofer). So the sound is better but you need an SACD decoder to enjoy it. I personally prefer multi-channel mixes. That's why I spent all that money on an SACD player and decoder."
3,Arena Rock never dies....they just play Ice Rinks......,Journeys greatest hits....now how can you go wrong. All the biggies are here and all you need is a Journey jersey and a bic and your ready for the weekend. Have at it but be careful and make sure you check in those black suede earth shoes before Monday.
5,JOURNEYMAN,"Ever been down that lonely ""journey"" of life? And you know who I'm talkin about out there! When you were traveling down that lonely highway & you pop this cd in the cd player. It gives you that perspective of life from an outsider point. It's you looking in from the outside. Journey & their music give you what no other band really does & that sense of ""i've been there before"". With Steve Perry on vocals, this album really gives it to ya!"
5,Worth every penny!,I haven't enjoyed a CD as much as I have this one in a long time! You just can't beat Steve Perry and Journey! My favorite band for so many reasons and most of them are on this CD!
2,"Great pressing, bad engineering","So I believe someone else mentioned something regarding the high quality of the vinyl - I agree. It's one of the best pressings you'll find, with low surface noise, thick 180g weight, and minimal pops and clicks. There's just one problem......The engineering is poor. It states that it is mastered for vinyl; yet, the amount of sibilance is unbearable the further inward the needle tracks. For a medium that is supposed to provide a better listening experience, this was so bad that I decided to return the album. I've heard many other albums that weren't even mastered for vinyl that sounded better (and had little, if any, sibilance issues).My advice? Save your money, unless you want this as a collector's item."
5,Its the greatest,THE greatest cd I currently own. Nothing else can compare with Journey. Everytime I hear their music it justs wonderful. If I could I would rate it more than 5 stars! I also bought Steve Perrys solo album as well.
3,"Hey Everybody, We're All Gonna Get Laid!","""Any way you want it"" will always be remembered in Rodney's immortal words from Caddyshack. Rock on."
2,Awfully Lame,"There are no doubts about it. This band is one of the lamest on the planet. A few good songs keep this album alive, but most of them are just 100% garbage. Steve Perry's voice is horribly annoying, with his dumb ""oh-oooh-ooh-oh"" sound that makes you want to puke. The backing vocals are silly and overrated. The dumb genre that is called AOR or album-oriented-rock is not for me, I guess."
1,Dreadful,"The worst kind of corporate arena rock the 80's had to offer, Journey offered the nails on a chalkboard vocals of Steve Perry, and the generic, faceless, songs and music of the rest of the band. Buy this only as another reminder of why we can all be thankful that the 80's are over!"
1,SACD does not mean surround!,"This person wrote a bad review because he said it was only in stereo. Not all SACDs are in surround, but even the stereo ones have better sound quality than a regular cd, if you have the right equipment! Or maybe the problem is you're listening to Journey!"
4,good,I heard these songs at a friends house and had to add them to my collection because I enjoyed them. I still listen to them.
1,love the music - hate the format,"I love the album and the music, but hate the new .amz format. I have never had a problem with downloading music from amazon before & enjoyed purchasing special deals. I won't be buying anymore music if it comes in this format."
5,Don't stop beleiving ....,"Wow!this is good stuff.I was never really into Journey but when I borrowed this from my music director at church I became a Journey fan.I don't know if this has all of their best songs, but I really don't care.Just can't wait to get some of their other cds.This is good for anybody who is just getting into Journey.Trust me, it made me into a fan."
4,A Must Have 80's Disc,"If you lived through the 80's, you know who Journey is. They were one of the kings of the power ballad and of the stadium rock band. Steve Perry's voice is unmistakable and is so distinct that his solo career actually was hurt because his own songs sounded like Journey as a result.Unfortunately, I can't give this CD all 5 stars. Yes, the tunes are great to listen to, but they aren't really the kind of standard setting music which deserve a 5-star rating. The music isn't bad, but it IS over-the-top 80's music from a time with style overshadowed substance."
3,beware for sellers,"a seller just send a rip from this cd, i dont know how can amazond allow this. this completely affect other selles who really sell products as advertised.except for digital downloadable mp3 purchase on the store, i think any kind of copy from originals cds (as seller claim) is illegal and amazon have to take complete care of this situation.i dont care the money, but i will not accept this.the music is great (5 stars), amazon sellers sucks (1 star)"
3,Greatest Hits-Journey.,"I guess listening or owning this cd is being a poser or ""Poseur"", but who cares what people think? This CD has Don't stop believing for when your feeling down or when your coming off of Danzig(way better band) or something Hardcore. couple good songs that's it.It would be way worse to listen and like New Kids on the Block(AHHHHHHHHHH!!!)"
3,Third time's a charm?,"I'm not going to particularly knock this release, but I'm weird in that I try to save the little stickers that come on the cellophane of CDs (I carefully peel them off and then stick them back on the jewel case) and I thought people might find something interesting. For their 1996 Journey - ""Greatest Hits"" release, this is how Sony hyped it on the sticker: ""NEW 20 BIT DIGITAL TRANSFER USING SONY'S SBM PROCESS."" Since that was actually the second time this album had been issued on compact disc, maybe the third time's a charm. Or, maybe it was time to milk a few more dollars from the Journey catalog?"
5,Very Pleased,"Unlike a lot of ""Greatest Hits"" CD's that you can purchase, I think this CD might actually have all of Journey's Greatest Hits on it. Almost every track is great song that you will remember within seconds of it starting. I am very happy I purchased this CD, and I think if you get it, you will be too!"
5,It's Journey... What else can you say?,"One of the best bands ever. Steve Perry's voice must be God's personal muse. This is the one to buy if you don't get but one Journey CD. Of course, you could really spoil yourself and get them all... well the ones with Steve Perry singing in them at least."
5,"If it is Journey with Steve Perry, it's got to be good",Great music with the greatest singer of all time!
5,You'd never know,"A friend of mine was playing this CD, and I realized that I could sing along to half of them. I'd never heard of Journey, but even if you don't recognize the name, you'll know their music with so many great hits like ""Faithfully,"" ""Don't Stop Believin',"" ""Open Arms,"" ""Wheel in the Sky,"" ""Only the Young,"" and many more. You'll be playing this CD anytime you want to have a good energy builder and when you just want to sing along. Definately a good buy."
5,highly recommended CD,This is the first CD I've ever bought where I can honestly say I enjoy such a high percentage of the music on it. Whoever picked the songs to include on this CD definitely has good taste!
5,Great!,"I read 1/2 of this book sitting in a book shop in Canada on holiday. I was so impressed. I asked my mom to find it for me cheaper, it was 60 dollars Canadian :( She found it here and bought it for me. I have now purchased it for my father for his birthday. Yes, this books is that good! It is the perfect book for any car nut!"
4,"Lavish, well-written and it weighs ten pounds!","Yes, this book really is that heavy and it is really very good. The pages are lavishly laid out, the text is readable (though translated from Italian with a few errors) and the photos are breath-taking.Hoewever, here's why it's not a five star book: the authors strongly favor the European automobile tradition to the point that the American cars are almost entirely dismissed out of hand. After seemingly endless pages devoted to all manner of continental models, the chapter on modern American ragtops is titled ""Too many Targas"". Too bad the American car industry is so minor.Buy his book, stare in wonder at the creations men have wrought for the past hundred years, but don't read the text too closely if you care about our American auto tradition."
2,Doesn't Work for All Cats,"I have a male that was acting out not using his litter pan, I purchased this product hoping it would do the trick. Unfortunately it didn't work. I am sure it does for some cats, but not for all. I suggest buying the smallest bag first to make sure as it is expensive. It is a nice litter and clumps well, so I gave it 2 stars for that."
2,"Beware--Once you ""Attract"" You Can't Go Back","This product definitely works...in fact, it works so well that my cat seems to refuse to use any other brand now. This is not necessarily very good news, as it is VERY expensive! The 20 pound bag only seems good for about 2 uses--and its $20 per bag...that's $40 per month for one small siamese cat. The litter gets used up FAST because it really seems to ""extreme clump""....meaning, my cat pees once and it clumps so much that when I scoop it out, half the litter is gone. I'm now trying out new things and I'll let you know how they work out. The other complaint I have is that it seems messier than other litters I've tried...lots of little white grains all over our kitchen floor...and this is with a large and deep cat pan. :-(Nov. 8, 2008: Well, we tried some other brands and she basically told us what she thought by leaving gifts on the floor. So it's back to champagne days and caviar catbox nights..."
5,Miracle,"My cat became very picky about litter boxes after a few years of having her. She had 3 separate litterboxes that I scooped at least once a day and she would still randomly go on the floor in front of the box. As soon as we got this, the problem was 95% solved. I have been using Cat Attract for almost a year and have cut back from 3 litterboxes to 2 and haven't had a problem in months. This is more expensive than regular litter, but very much worth it. I am planning to try diluting the cat attract with some cheaper litter, but I don't care if we have to keep using this forever. IT WORKS. I wish I could get the 40 lb bag at local stores, the shipping is too much online!"
2,Cats won't touch it,"I have 2 2 yo males neutered cats who have never used the litter box consistently for pooping. I have tried nearly every type of litter, litter box, self-cleaning or basic plastic box, lid, no lid, etc. Desperate, I bought this product with great hopes--along with two more litter boxes and a box of Arm and Hammer clumping litter.They now have 4 boxes with 3 different litters. Yet the only litter they have *never* used for relieving themselves is ""Cat Attract."" Yes, they have been inside the box, evidenced by the litter being moved around. But they have never done their business there and continue to poop on the floor next to it. In fact, they will occasionally use the new Arm & Hammer litter, similar in texture to Cat Attract, but not the product in question.Like the other reviewer indicated, it is nice litter otherwise, so I gave it 2 stars. But don't assume this litter will be your cure-all for behavioral problems. HTH a little. Good luck."
5,cat retraining made easy!,"We recently acquired a young female cat who became sick after we'd had her for 2 weeks. She associated her gastric distress with the litter box and began peeing next to the box rather than in it. I tried a new litter box and switched to a different litter, Feline Pine, and she continued to pee next to the box. I read online about Cat Attract and purchased some the same day. The kitty used the litter box the next time she peed and has continued to use the litter box since then. I am SO pleased to have found a product which made retraining successful. Thank you Dr. Elsey!For cats that spray this would not be likely to work. For that my vet has prescribed cyproheptadine, no kidding. It's an antihistimine and no one knows exactly why it works, but we've used it for 11 years with very good results. One of the side effects is euphoria so that may be the key."
2,"Didn't work for our problem cat, but the litter itself is great.","Our cat is still peeing outside her litter box, so it didn't solve that issue. It may have helped our kitten, he wasn't fully litter box trained when we found him and would pee on the bed/sofa/towels. We'd broken him of everything except the bed when we got this litter, we also got a second open box and moved it next to the bed (gross but necessary)at the same time. He stopped peeing on the bed but we're not sure if it was because the box was right there or because of the litter. However, we LOVE this litter, it clumps better than our old litter and smells good. The cats seem to like it as well. It's only a couple dollars more than our old litter (Scoop Away) at Petsmart. It was almost $10 more at Petco. We've permanently switched to this litter."
4,good buy,although jackie is not my fav charachter from this game he is a great collectible figure he is more for posing than for actually playing with but if you are into the game that won't matter to you so if you love the game get this figure if for a child who wants an action figure dont buy this.
4,Toy critic,I Found that this toy is great for playing games with friends and family so enjoy this toy and remember always be a kid at heart.
4,WLS patient approved,"I had gastric bypass surgery a year ago and am constantly on the hunt for low carb-high protein snacks/foods. At 100 calories, 2 carbs, and 20 grams of protein, this product is perfect for my nutritional needs. While not decadent, it is tasty."
2,Not the best ever,"This pudding tastes a little funky. It sports kind of a metallic, sort of bitter aftertaste, and I can't quite identify the main flavor, but in my humble estimation, it ain't chocolate. I've had Medifast pudding, which is equally low-calorie & high-protein, and was expecting something more along those lines...something that tastes more like, um, pudding. I wish I'd found a single can of the stuff somewhere before committing to a whole case of the stuff. Convenient? Yep. Great for my diet? Absolutely. Palatable? Not so much."
4,AN AITF FAN,"I really enjoy ""All In The Family"", and when ""Archie Bunker's Place"" took up where ""AITF"" left off, I missed Edith, who was my favorite caracture in the series. But, just as real life changes so did the show with Edith's death. Yes, Archie softened somewhat, but now he was caring for little Stephanie. If you look at ""Archie Bunker's Place"" on it's own merrits' I'm sure you'll agree, It's still one of the better sitcoms TV has ever offered, and deserves to be viewed as a continuing story in the life of Archie Bunker not a replacement for ""All In The Family"". I too, would like to see ""AITF"" seasons come a little faster, ok a lot faster, but that won't keep me from getting these eposodes as they are available."
3,What a walk down memory lane!,You just can not find this show on TV. I watch All in the Family all the time on cable. But could never find Archie Bunker's Place on TV. It was a great walk down memory lane to be able to see this show.
4,"STILL WAITING FOR SEASON 2, 3, ETC...","Bought Archie Bunker's Place, season 1 when released .... so what's the hold up almost 5 years later for the additional seasons???"
3,ARCHIE BUNKERS PLACE 1ST Season DVD,"Have just picked up the 1st season of ABP and I am looking forward to watching it. I am a big fan of All In THe Family but never really had a chance to watch this followup series...so most of the episodes will be ""new"" to me.One question, why on the back cover is there a picture of Edith with Beverly La Salle? If I'm not mistaken, wasn't she from AITF? Is there actually an episode on ABP that again features this character and if so, how is this possible? Or is this a blooper picture wise on the back cover? I have read the episode listings for this 1st season and see no mention of this character who was so close to Edith. Any one have an answers?Thanks."
5,Better than I remember,"I bought the set and was very surprised to find that the episodes were much better than I remember them. I have to admit that they do not compare with the early All in the Family episodes, but neither do the later All in the Family episodes. But none the less, I am glad they are on DVD and am glad that I purchased them. Does anyone know if the second season will be available soon?"
4,Edit Issues,"I own every ""All In The Family"" season box set out on the market and started collecting the ""Archie Bunker's Place"" season box sets. Can someone please explain to me why we still get edited versions??? I thought the idea behind dvd is that we are supposed to get commercial free and unedited versions. To my knowledge, even All in the Family has a few edited episodes. Why are they doing this? It is frustrating."
2,Blue Screens,"I bought this card because it does not have the external power connector requirements. However, even though my computer has a power supply within the required size, my computer kept getting blue screen stop errors. I finally upgraded my power supply but the new one has the external power connectors so I just put in a better card. Oh, and I returned the card once for a new one and still had the blue screens. Removing the card stopped the blue screen problem.Be aware that it may actually need you to have a larger power supply than what is stated."
5,"Beginner to Expert, Easy",The pictures and information in this book make it so easy that anyone can do it. It makes it almost impossible for someone not to succeed. All of the Robert Bruce Thompson and Barbara Fritchman Thompson books are good but this latest one excels.
2,Too Old,"This might have been useful in 2000 when it was first printed, but references to Windows 98 don't help much in a Vista world. Why publish a 2nd edition without updating the information?"
4,Cover and binding damaged,"The content of the book is good. But I wanted to write a review when I learned I would have to pay return shipping for a product that arrived damaged. The paperback cover is glued on, and it came unglued, and I can't get it to re-attach. The binding itself is also torn, and the first part of the book, the pages are loose at the bottom half.I'm extremely upset at having paid for a new book and received this junk. I dont have a printer, and am not paying return shipping to get my money back, so I'm stuck with it. My only option is to let others know what happened to me. It wont hold up to repeated use, since it is a technical manual."
4,Kindle Version Review,"This is a review specifically aimed at the Kindle version of the book - and not so much a review of the book itself.I commented previously on Kindle version of Keyes' book ""A Calculus of Angles"" concerning the poor job that was done in the translation to the Kindle format. I am very glad to say that the formatting issues in ""The Shadows of God"" are almost non-existent. This Kindle book outshines the formatting of all the previous Kindle books in this series. Yes there is an occasional mis-translated word or spacing but they are very few and far between.With the formatting issues resolved I was able to better enjoy the story that Mr Keyes was telling rather than being hung up on trying to decipher *what* he was trying to say. The story was well told and I enjoyed this entire series of books. As far as the Kindle version goes - this last book was the highpoint of the series."
4,cast again,"CAST AGAIN, by Jennifer OlssonJennifer Olsson writes humorouesly and witty about her experiences both as guide for fly anglers, and beeing a woman in such a job. She is a sharp observer and tells her stories honestly and gives us insight in the flyfishing environment. I liked reading this book.I purchased this book at Amazon."
3,Cast Again,"The book reflected the author's love of fly-fishing. However, the way in which it was written would make it appeal more to women than men. If one was intending to purchase this for an older male it probably would not be appreciated."
1,garbage,"Worked for about two weeks then started missing keystrokes, locking up, etc. Check out the program 'synergy' for something better."
5,The best book ever!!,"The Lady and the Lion has the best illistations (in my opinion!)! When you look at the pictures, you think, Man, how does Laurel Long paint those pictures in oil paint and watercolor paper. I think that this book should have won the Caldecott Award, but instead, the book The man Who Walked Between the Towers won. I also think that, the ALA Caldecott book had good pictures, but I think that The Lady and the Lion should have won. This book is probably good for ages 7 and up. The reason 7 and up is because you have to be able to read it by yourself. Although, if you can't read it on your own, the pictures tell the story. If you like the two stories, Cinderella and The Beauty and the Beast, then this is the book for you, becuase it is a mix between those two stroies. I hope that you will find time to read this book!!"
2,"Boring, but fun...","This group is about as boring as I can listen to and not fall asleep, or remove from my player in midstream. Repeative, boring and monotenous. In the order of instrumental rap or hip-hop but they do try singing. They do it all, just not very well at any of it."
3,Some good tunes,"I'm no expert on The Meters or New Orleans Funk, but felt that I needed at least one collection CD to represent the group and genre in my music collection. I guess I'm in accord with some other reviewers but perhaps not for the same reason. There are great tracks here and they *will* get you dancing. But some of the tunes did not flip my switch. To reiterate, it's good, but I expected a little more."
1,Flyfisher's guide to Idaho,I found that this book basically talked about the major streams in Idaho and did not give information about most of the streams and small reserviors located therein
5,Hangar9 40 Cub Wing Tube,It replaced the bent one that came with the model.I bought the model from a friend that had an accident with the model.
3,Giga Bank- Great idea...buggy as hell.,"I decided to buy the giga bank 80gb to prevent my hd from getting too full of stuff I put on. However, the larger the file I put on, the more messed up the drive becomes. It eventually becomes unstable to a point of quitting. However, for storing stuff, great."
4,Nice compilation of european metal on CD and DVD,"I purchased this at a steal of a price, and it contains 190 minutes of video and 52 minutes on CD. [...] I really love apocalyptica, and that made it worth buying for me, but you also have to love the Cd track suicidal masturbation by Pyorrhoea, just an odd name, decent track. This is an excellent sampler, and worth a look at."
4,Tough so far,"I got these for my always-outside beater in the fall. They've been removed and replaced on 2 handlebars, and left out in the ice all winter, and seem to be holding up. (The rubber still seems flexible.) The grip feel is a good balance between gummy and hard."
3,Painting Themselves Into a Corner?,"Joey Burns and John Convertino have created a niche entirely their own and have remained true to their vision of creating dusty, mariachi-tinged soundscapes that capture the mood of the early Southwest with nary a hint of pretention. No musical anachronisms here--everything is true to form.That said, the only song on this extended play that could be called ""essential"" is the new single, Crystal Frontier, which is a tad bit livlier than most Calexico songs. The rest is remixes and B-sides, etc. A new version of Sonic Wind is okay, but there is nothing here that really pulls you in (not that any of their songs are truly involving). I suspect this CD was released to promote Crystal Frontier and the band's current U.S. tour, suggesting Calexico may be in need of new directions or new ways to mine <i>oro</i> from the same vein. Not bad, but not likely to win any new fans.Calexico needs to be seen live to appreciate what they do. They put on a memorable show."
2,Not needed,Disc of unnecessary outtakes and extensions really doesn't work unless heavily invested in the band's material.
5,Even Sure Things Fall Through,"This album is a SURE thing. From the first cut on, it is just beautiful. I have tried it on two of my pickiest friends who agree that they found it outstanding as well. Thank you NPR for interviewing Joe Burns and introducing me to this fine sound."
5,THE BEST ALBUM EVER!,"This album has all your favorites on 2 CD's, and was recorded right when David Gilmour's voice was at its best. Awesome."
3,"A Cool Live Album, But The Video Is Quite Better!","I heared the album before i saw the video, which i had just bought, and i came to realize the video is better. It has better and a few more songs than the album, and the light & laser FX are awsome!(but not as good as PULSE's) The backing band members such as Jon Carin (keyboards;vocals), Gary Wallice (percussion), Tim Wrenwick (guitars; vocals), Guy Pratt (bass;vocals), Scott Page (sax), and the 3 backing vocals, you can tell, are having a blast performing with David Gilmour (lead guitars & vocals), Nick Mason (percussion), and Richard Wright (Keyboards; vocals)! Well...based on this review, I should do one for the DSOT video, as well. Anyway...I recommend the video 'just' a little bit over the album."
2,I Wonder What Roger Thinks?,"This live album leaves much to be desired. A great set list only to be marred by lazy Gilmour vocals and terrible Scott Page sax. You can actually hear Gilmour just saying the lyrics to Us and Them. Gilmour takes control of Floyd and does exactly what Roger said they would do ""Milk the name for all it is worth."". I can not say much more about the video either. It is clear that Gilomour's heart is no longer into it. The really sad part is the choice of songs for this tour. They are great songs but with a lackluster performance it is heartbreaking to hear them. Gilmour has gotten so lazy not only does he not want to sing he also turns some of the lead over to Tim Renwick. So, I give this album 2 stars and that is because of Gilmour's lead on Comfortably Numb and a great choice of songs."
2,poor sound quality,Having read some of the reviews for this album I went ahead with my purchase. A big mistake. The audio engineers must have been lacking in experience because as much as I like Pink Floyd this is really bad in the sound department. I recently puchased Pulse. A far superior work worthy of five stars. This one you can forget about. Very disappointing.
1,Very boring,The entire double set is very boring and the songs are all played very tight. The only part I like is the guitar solo on Time but I don't think that it is sufficient reason to get this double album. I'd rather pay twice as much to get a live set from the mid-70s(which I did) then get this again. You'll see the difference.
2,"Great songs, poor album","Anybody who has ever listened to Floyd will tell you that none of the songs were ever meant to be played alone. All of their albums are really one giant song, and to take away the most popular segments of the album and put them together in a seemingly random order is just awful. ""Us and Them"" doesnt sound nearly as smooth and powerful when it doesnt follow ""Money"". The songs are fantastic, dont get me wrong, and for a newcomer to Floyd this might be a decent way to see if you like their stuff. However, I don't listen to this album anymore because I own all of Floyd's CD's up till Water's split. In short, buy the real albums, not this one."
5,Delicate Sound of Thunder: Live,Enjoyed this CD so much took it with other CD's to a weekend family gathering. Ended up purchasing this copy for a family member who also loved it. It is great!
1,Dead side of the moon,"I hope Gilmour ceases to exist real soon before Pink Floyd is forever [drained] dry of all its former greatness. If you like this you should check out The Band without Robbie Robertson or Little Feat without Lowell George...or how about that Beatles single that came out long after Lennons death. oh, by the way, Rick Wright has given up playing keyboards at this point but he looks good in the band photo. Have fun, sheep!"
4,It's not Pulse but it has its moments,"Pulse is indeed the best Pink Floyd live album, no question. But this little diddy isn't too bad either. Sure enough all the versions of the songs on DSoT are inferrior to the ones on Pulse. But that doesn't make them horrific to listen to. I actually recomend getting both Pulse and Delicate Sounds of Thunder. They both have a great feel, and Pink Floyd fans will love them. The only real attrocity on this album is Another Brick in the Wall part II, where the song doesn't seem to have any life in it at all. it seems it was just thrown in there. Other than that this really is a decent effort. Just try it."
4,solid live cd,"If you notice their are mixed reviews about this cd. However, if you are a true floydian this cd is a no brainer. David gilmour never put out the body of work that waters did but he always participated in the best of the best (time, comfortably numb ...crazy diamond, etc.) If waters was with the band this cd would most likely be 5 stars but if gilmour's guitar and vocals weren't and waters still played on it DSOT would probably be 3 stars or less. It still is a definite solid cd with some great live tracks that can only be equalled by hard to find floyd bootlegs."
4,A Momentary Lapse Of Reason: Improved Version,"I like to think of this as the improved version of A Momentary Lapse Of Reason. It's got the highlights from that album and the best songs from the rest of their career. The biggest issue I have with this is David Gilmour's vocals on some of the songs (ex. Another Brick In The Wall). Besides that, it's pretty cool. Probably my favorite song on here is One Of These Days. In my opinion, it's superior to the Meddle version. Another problem I have is Money. I don't like hearing this song live. If you've heard the Pulse version, it's basically the same. It just has too much of that ""hoo"" vocal stuff on it. Anywho, besides whatever, this is a pretty decent album. If you had to pick between this or AMLOR, go with this."
2,Gilmour is not floyd.,"This album is a travesty to Pink Floyd. Gilmour has amazing guitar work, but the vocals of gilmour in an attempt to replace Waters are pathetic.I sound more like waters. I sounds like it was recorded at a kereoke bar with 50,000 middle-aged fans. I would have been fine with Floyd all dying in a plane crash after ""Final Cut"" was recorded. I hate these CDs so much I gave them away for 5$. Buy stuff with the real floyd, like the mid-1970s releases."
3,Is this still Pink Floyd?,"No doubt, Pink Floyd can pull off one hell of a rock concert, and I've only seen them on video! Their songs are great and the laser lights show is unmatched by any other band. Listening to their live album 'Delicate Sound of Thunder', I couldn't help but wonder if this is still the real Pink Floyd. It makes no sense to release a live album where the songs sound exactly the same as they do on the studio album. Listen to The Who or the Greatful Dead; their live songs are much more original and interesting then their studio songs. They offer something new and refreshing. No reason to buy a live album if it sounds exactly like the studio stuff, unless one likes to hear the croud cheer in the background.I guess ""Pink Floyd"" was trying to make a few extra bucks from the songs and ideas of Roger Waters. It seems like ""Pink Floyd"" accomplished at that goal."
5,some people's lack of taste...,"This album is an unbelievable picture of one of the best bands of all time in concert. The fact that people are trashing this in previous reviews surprises me. But there are a lot of idiots out there. This album is much better than Pulse, the songs don't sound as forced and they flow together nicely. The 'Shine on You Crazy Diamond' still gives me chills. Floyd with Gilmour at the helm seems more laid back than under Waters. The vocals are more soothing than grating (not that I dislike Waters at all). I completely recommend this album to anyone who wants an incredible concert disc. The version of 'Us and Them' is utterly amazing...Buy it and love it.."
2,Does not do Pink Floyd justice.,"Pink Floyd was and still is one of the greatest live bands ever, however Delicate Sound Of Thunder is a poor representation. Recorded toward the end of several years of touring, the performances are average and David Gilmour's voice is tired and weak. There were several recordings from earlier in the tour (For a possible live album/video) that simply blow away these recordings away. They appeared on CD-singles, but for whatever reason, they failed to make the live album. To top it off, the mixing is terrible ... Seems like a ""rushed"" product overall. There are much better live recordings of the Floyd out there, I would suggest looking for those ..."
1,Where is The Great Gig in the Sky?,"The Great Gig song is in the concert VHS tape version but it is left out of this cd. Why? To watch the VHS version of this cd- The Great Gig in the Sky is a very powerful, emotionally moving experience and in my opinion the best part of this whole concert. It was left out of the cd and I resent that. I've always been Floyd through and though but I regret buying this cd."
1,Just Not Good,"I have a lot of Pink Floyd, and I know a lot of Pink Floyd. Although this CD appears to have a great lineup of songs, don't be fooled! They sound nothing like the studio versions, and the noise of the crowd is very distracting. Furthermore, half of the songs are from A Momentary Lapse of Reason, a very forgettable and banal (boring) album. Let's face it-- Roger Waters was a bit controlling and vitriolistic, but without him Pink Floyd can't make a really good album. Spend your money on something made before 1980."
1,The Dark Side of Unemployment,"Pink Floyd has suffered one of the most ignoble declines of any classic rock band. Without Roger Watters in the fold, there is simply no point (other than making money). That is brought home in spades on this lifeless, turgid concert album documenting their 1987 ""comeback"" tour. The new songs don't measure up to the classics and the classics were much better the first time around. A sorry fate for a once-great band."
3,Cute but doesn't blow great bubbles!,"These bubbles are cute but they are tiny and the little wand inside is even tinier! The hole to blow bubbles out of on the wand is probably only 1/4 inch or seems like, so it blows tiny, tiny bubbles! But, the pirates on top and the treasure chest shape of the bubbles container is cute and worked well with our son's pirate b-day party them. If you're looking for cute, these are great. If you're looking for functional, they are not so good!"
4,GOOD PRODUCT,GOOD ITEM'BUT COULD NOT WORK IT WITH MY WINDOW VISTA;I WANTED IT TOO!AND THE PRICE WAS CHEAP TOO!
5,The Best New Hampshire Guidebook,"This guidebook is wonderful in showing the many personalities of New Hampshire. With over 500 pages on our Granite State, it reveals the little-known gems that abound here. I checked out a copy from our library recently to explore southwestern New Hampshire, and it was so useful I am ordering a copy. It has excellent in-depth descriptions of inns, B&Bs and restaurants, as well as full descriptions of outdoor recreation opportunities. The writing is crisp and informative, and there are numerous photos. Maps are not plentiful, but the maps that are included are helpful. Recommended for residents as well as adventurous travelers."
3,Love it.,I miss holding books. I love all the stories by Bechwith. I wish there were more to buy and read.
1,Misreview,"I'm reviewing your description of the book, not the book itself.I could be wrong, but I think that the description you have is entirely wrong! In other words, it's for some other book, not for Floating Cities.There's a disconnect somewhere!"
5,"""A Wonderful Momento""","There isn't a lot of video footage of Donna Summer exisiting with her in concert so this rare 1999 special she filmed for VH1 is a real gem. Spawning an album of the same name, ""Live and More"" feature's the late singer doing some of the best songs in her career including ""Last Dance"", ""MacArthur's Park"", ""She Works Hard For The Money"" and with new singer Tina Arena ""Enough Is Enough"", a song Donna did with Barbra Streisand in 1979.Donna, as always, looks beautiful here and her voice proved that the older she became she NEVER lost her powerful voice.Rest in peace my angel...we miss you!"
4,I never was a big fan but I really enjoyed this.,"I never was a huge fan of Donna Summer, but I must say that she looked and sounded great, and I enjoyed her newer stuff about as much as her classics. It made me think that I really didn't appreciate her talent as much as I should have back in her heyday. This is worth watching for the blast-from-the-past effect alone, but you might find yourself more of a fan when it's over than when it begins."
5,Donna Summer The Queen Continues,Donna is Fabulously Awesome once again in her VH1 presentation. A must have for addition to any Donna Fan's Collection.
2,Donna Summer: VH1,"I saw the DVD at a relative's home, and really enjoyed. However, the DVD I recieved from Amazon was of poor quality. The DVD skipped several times and was not enjoyable to view. I doubt I would purchase anymore DVD's from Amazon. This is not my first DVD purchase from Amazon and I have had to return more than one DVD for exchange and it is not worth the effort. The reason I purchase from Amazon is so I'm not trolling through the malls,Donna Summer: VH1 Presents Live and More Encore!but if I have to keep going to the post office to exchange where is the advantage?"
5,The Voice of an Angel.........,"I was glued to my TV in the 90's when this special was produced and aired on VH1. The first lady of disco transcends that label to become one of the GREATEST voices of this, or any time. If you have loved her since the mid 70's or don't even know her name, this concert will appeal to you because her voice and stage presence are UNMATCHED. She passed away on May 17, 2012 and this world will never see another like her. Her battle with cancer proved she was a true professional right to the last. DO NOT MISS THIS!!!!!!!!!!! This concert will stand as a tribute to her memory. She sings with an angelic choir now."
5,I love you Donna,"This is the best ever Donna Summer concert when she was about 50 years old. It seems she was like wine, ever improving with the years. Great quality and great performance."
1,not a good product,fuse blew as soon as it was plugged in.When taking it apart to replace the fuse it broke apart
3,Worked fine... after a solder job touchup,"There seems to be a serious lack of high quality extension cords for 12VDC. This one was highly rated, but when I got it the construction quality was 'meh'. I bought 3, which isn't a very big sample size. Of the 3, one needed to have the solder connections in the socket redone. Overall, these extension cables are just ok. If I were doing this again, I'd try to find higher quality plug and sockets and some larger gauge wire (14 or 12 gauge), and build the cables myself.For small loads (<5amps), this cable will work fine."
5,Better than I expected.,"I purchased three of these pencil holders, I saw they were pretty cheap and looked nice. They arrived and they are VERY durable which I didn't expect, they are a nice size and they have rubber feet to prevent them from scratching your desk. I would definitly reccomend them to anone they are a great product."
4,I like it,"I've had this for a few months and use it for occasional FAXing. I decided to pay the extra money to get an inkjet instead of the cheaper thermal printers, mainly because I read that thermal cartridges don't last long and replacements are expensive (i.e. you get the machine cheaper up front, but over the long term it costs more). Since the B740 uses the same ink wells as some of Canon's bubble printers, I also figured it'd be easier to get replacement ink wells a few years down the road.The machine does what it's supposed to do and I've been happy with it so far. Setup was a slight pain, although a call to Canon support took care of that. Overall the manual is good. Note that the machine has a copy mode which is useful for the occasional copy."
2,"Paper grabbing, ink-toner eater","I've had the B740 for a while. It does a fast job of sending out FAXes. It switches nicely between phone & FAX. Goes through the Canon toners like a binge eater. It has two problems that are making me search for another brand or model as I add a FAX to another location: 1) the paper feeding is not even. The machine grabs two piece of paper at once no matter how careful I am, so I often have to fax items more than once. 2) When you dial and get a busy signal, the machine redials. There is no way to cancel the FAX in between its redialing. You have to catch it during the redial. If you have the wrong number, heaven help the person at the other end of the line. The incoming copies are so-so.This time I'm going for a laser printer and figure I'll save on the cartridges over time."
3,Not for the average industry professional,"The authors have written a very detailed, well structured text on the different models and developments in the power and fuel markets. It's a very complex, mathematical analysis of the different techniques being used, and the text may lose a number of readers in the overly rigorous formulations. For those involved in risk management, market modeling, or asset management, the book would be a good secondary or tertiary read after you've established a sound understanding of stochastic models and current hedging and pricing techniques in the marketplace. For the layman in the industry, the book will be far too heavy and not worth the read."
3,A good book for the designer of energy risk managment tools,"If you develop computer code in this field it could be a help, but if you are more interested in knowing more about the ways to avoid risk in the energy business I would recommend another book. There are also not enough practical examples to give a good understanding of the principles.Dynamic hedging is not explained to the extent wanted. The examples are also not very clear."
1,The Book Never got Delivered,"I can't provide much of a review because I ordered it on 9/23/2010 and as of 10/25/2010 I did not receive it.Indoobestsellers advises that it got lost in the mail. They say they issued a refund and went on their way. Meanwhile I am scratching my head wondering what happened to my book. I know I paid for the book this month, I hope the credit shows up for next month.Not a great experience. I would have expected someone to bend over backwards to serve the customer."
1,A Book to Skip,"Having read several books by Emma Blair, I was looking foward in reading ""Passionate Times.""The book starts out at the end of World War 2 and tell the story of a British Soldier Reith Douglas who has been injured and lost his memory. Returning to Glasgow and his wife Irene, he does remember Irene said that she was in love with Billy Boyne a true Villian and Irene's abuser. Once he remember his pre-war life, Reith becomes a gangster himself and starts having affair with Catie Smith. As the years progress these three people's worlds are going to meet.I have to say that I was about 100 pages into the book, until I realized that this book was really bad. So do yourself a favorite and just skip it."
5,Yes,"This book is truly amazing, and provides good insight in addiction problems in a reflected, deep and structured wayit is a good contribution while regaining ones identity of a non-addict concerning all addictions, I truly recognised a lot when reading this bookandalthough these are things some of us already know, seeing them from this books angle was a valuble contribution on the recovery pathhighly recommend this book for anybody struggeling with any kind of addiction cause it gives u insight in the mecanismes that made u addicted in the first place and thereby it helps in avoiding relapse when normal life sets in after overcoming addiction"
4,Great for families/friends of addicts!,If you have a loved one that is an addict this is a great book to read. It clears up a lot of myths and common misconceptions about addiction. However if your an ex-user I would get the book but it's not the best at helping you develop coping skills. Either way solid B.
4,One of the Best,"As an addiction counselor, I am always looking for books to recommend to my clients. This book in my opinion is one of the best out there. I usually will have my clients read this along with ""7 Tools to Beat Addiction"" by Stanton Peele. This gives them an understanding of two very different ways of approaching the problem and between the two you get a pretty comprehensive overview of treatment strategies."
4,Great winder for the $$.,This watchwinder has been a very good investment. It keeps all my autos wound well and the timer feature makes it very convenient and a no-hassle tool.Highly recommended.
4,Great Workmanship!,"I purchased the automatic watch winder for my fiancés' birthday. The product came within 7 days and the packaging was well put together. When I opened the automatic watch winder it caught my eye by the sleek, deep dark wood, and light tan velvet lined drawers, which represents elegance. This is exactly what I wanted and at great price. Most watch winders run anywhere from $200-$1000. I have not used the winder yet, but I would highly recommend this as a gift for a father, significant other, and/or friend."
4,Does the job; worried about how long it will last,"I bought this after reading the reviews mainly because of the relatively low price. I've used it for a couple of days and it seems to be working as advertised. I like how it has different timing settings, but don't know if that feature really makes a difference for the watch I'm using it for. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it seems to be kind of cheaply made; it's all plastic and I am concerned about how durable it is, not that I plan to beat it up or anything, but still. . ."
4,watch winder,pros:1. works as described and silent.2. good value for money.cons:1. insufficient reminder/notice that the 110V adapter supplied cannot be used in asia. had to get aftermarket transformer.
3,An excellent watch winder!,"I was quite skeptical with the product at first. However after reading the reviews, I gave the product a try. I have it for a month now and it's still running great. It is a good buy for the price. I keep the winder by the bedside, and both wife and I do not hear any noise from the motor. I'll provide an update if the motor is dead. Cross my fingers.I gave it a 3 because the face cover of top winder is a bit loose, but the winder is working fine - just a little care to remove the watch, otherwise it is 4 star. I didn't bother with the hassle to ship back for replacement. The unit comes with 1 year warranty."
1,"bad customer service, bad watch winder",I bought this item watch winder. it worked for about a week before it stopped working. I've sent several e-mails to seller with no reply. don't bye from these people not because of the product but service. or the lack there of.
5,Very good watchwinder,I've just received this winder and i can say it looks incredible good. I'm still starting using that but i believe i had a great deal.
4,Watch Winder,"This is an excellent buy for anyone requiring automatic winding for one or two wrist watches. The unit is silent and efficient with four optional settings for operation. However, it took me awhile to figure out how to load the watch. More complete instructions are necessary. Also, on the negative side, the unit has the appearance of ""molded plastic."" The case, the watch holders, the rotating table all are made of plastic giving the impression of ""cheap"" -- which, of course, it is. Some further attention to improving its cosmetic features would certainly help. All-in-all, I recommend the unit for the budget minded."
2,Not ideal for Gold watches or heavy watches,All it took was about 3 months of use every other day and slowly the upper rotating arm started to slow down. I then moved my watch to the lower unit and now that one is failing as well. This would probably work well for a stainless steel watch or a light leather watch but not a full gold watch.The unit is quite and has diff timers which is good but the watch holder is plastic but again you get what you paid for.
2,"Love Lanza, did not like this product","I thought I would give this mousse a try since I love Lanza products, but it failed my test. I have studied hair products for years and not even a stylist, just enjoy it. This one failed my test.... sorry Lanza. Hot Style Volume Foam from Texturline can't be beat.... It leave your hair very soft... this one does not."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in these glasses - when I unpacked them, I felt they were cheap looking. They had a ""seam"" running down the side of the glass, which I associate with poor quality. In addition, two of the glasses had small chips in them; one broke after I took it out of the box. Not recommended."
2,Very Poor Packing,"When I received my glasses 2 were broken, so I only got 4 instead of the 6 I paid for. The box of glasses was placed in another box with ONE air pillow. I honestly couldn't believe how poor it was packed. Iv'e had a pair of jeans packed better than these glasses were. I notified them as soon as I received them but never heard a word. Poor customer service. Beware of ordering."
3,Great item but.......,"These were perfect for what we are using them for, however they were poorly packed...in their original packaging. Jostled around and 1 from each box had broken. Very disappointed. However with the remaining glasses have been very happy with thus far."
2,I AM NOT GOING TO RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE.,"IT'S BEGINNING TO BE A SHAME OF WHAT THE FAIRY TALE CLASSICS SERIES MAKES FOR THIS MOVIE. FIRST OF ALL, THEY TAKE A STORY OR LEGEND, SCREW IT UP, AND MAKE A FLICK OUT OF IT. THE MEN LOOK LIKE JAPANESE MEN, THE WOMEN LOOK LIKE CHINESE WOMEN, AND THE DESERTS LOOK ARABIAN. DO NOT SEE THE FLICK IF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very bad interpretation,"While it would be lovely if the people in real life made some of the choices made in this movie, they did not. This movie had so many misinterpretations that my children and I lost count. The makers of this film took far more license than necessary with this story - and made a different story from the Bible account. The pharaoh's grandson/Moses' brother by adoption ends up joining Moses (instead of Moses' natural brother), the burning bush's repeated use may as well have been a crystal ball in this ""adaptation"", and the miracles differed from the historical account. God's consequences for people's sins are not treated with the respect they deserve. This movie was a waste of time and one we will be tossing in the trash (not giving away or selling in a garage sale, even!) DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME on this movie."
1,not close to the Biblical account,"I was disappointed with this film. The Hanna-Barbara style graphics were what was to be expected, but the content grew less biblical as the film progressed. The account as recorded in the Bible seeemed to have been merely a loose guide for those who wrote the script of the movie. I am disappointed, because the intention was to have a BIBLEstory told to our children through the video. Maybe I could use it as a quiz: How many mistakes can you spot???"
3,empty disk holders. 12 of them.,You will receive 12 clear disk holders with a plastic insert -- not particularly well-made or poorly-made -- just standard disk holders. There are no paper inserts on which to label the disks.
1,Buyer Beware.,"Great idea, but lack of execution with HP. I would expect quality and reliability from HP, but this is absolutely the worst phone I have ever owned..next to my Palm Treo. I've owned this phone for 10 months and have had to replaced it 7 times due to software and hardware problems. Upgrading to the latest bios resolved some of the software problems, but the phone still broke down due to joystick, microphone, and poor reception. The only useful feature of this phone is the GPS. Once my contract expires in 2 months, I'm getting a new phone and use this thing only for the GPS...or until it breaks again.Nokia still makes the best phone."
1,replaced THREE TIMES!!!! giving up,this phone has broken three times from device malfunctions. i am giving up and demanding it be replaced by the 8125.DO NOT BUY!!!!just get another pda/phone with a bluetooth gps.
3,"Works, works, works","PDA phones are great for businessmen, like me.Complaint: my AT&T; plan was 900 minutes for $49... when Cingular bought AT&T; they didn't have a plan that came close."
1,do not buy,"ipaq 63, 6500 phones (7:05pm EST Thu Jan 26 2006)3 6300""s and 4 6500 's and cingular and hp are a TOTAL FAILURE and will continue to blame the customer. includes hard ware, phone quality, headset connector failure, mms failure, back up battery failure, sms failure, and cingular will send you refurbished phones with the same problem even ehen they find out there is a cingular system problem. DO NOT BUY CINGULAR OR HP. i have one year of falures and lost hundreds of hours thousands of dollars. read other actual long term users, the word is out HP and cingular will not support thier customers no matter how blatant thier errors and equipment are. - by scott burgess"
2,GPS not routing,"I bought this unit because I wanted a phone with integrated GPS. As a phone, I find it too difficult to handle, and I much prefer a smaller and more functional unit. It was quite a bit of work to get the GPS to function, and I placed at least 3 calls to HP. They referred me to Microsoft, because the GPS uses MS Pocket Maps. Microsoft does not offer an 800 number, and you can only talk to someone during business hours - no 24 hour support. Essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support. Finally I found out that the GPS system can only show you where you are currently located on the map - it is not designed to give you any directions how to get from one place to another. I finally returned it and bought a dedicated GPS system as well as the Ericsson w600i, which is a much better phone."
1,"OK Tool, but BREAKS DOWN ALOT","As an owner of one unit myself I can truly say that the ""iPaq 6515"" is NOT all that good. Having a ton of useful features, it lacks the most important - Quality. Cingular (the official provider) will give you a hell of time if something goes wrong or breaks and all you want is just to exchange it. They will ONLY send a refurbished phone, even if a brand new one was purchased. 3/4 of Cingular Customer Service don't know what GPS is and will give you a forever runaround. I was VERY happy with this phone, up untill all sorts of hardware problems start accuring.HP support are hard to get a hold of and most of them know less the the consumer.The reason for this AMAZON reveiw is hopes that many people will see it and think twice before investing so much money!Thank you all."
1,Not a reliable device,"After first couple of months of honeymoon, ipaq started to power off by itself for no apparent reason. Everytime I had to go thru remove the battery cover remove the battery replace battery replace battery cover and in few hours it shuts down., Cingular sent a replacement battery cover but it is of no use. I don't have any expectation from HP in terms of getting it replaced (past experience makes me not approach them). In a nutshell DON'T BUY THIS PHONE"
3,Average,"Published in 1959, this volume was a swift paced adventure set in Alaska. The best part of the book was the middle whereby they walked along a trail through the wilderness for several chapters. I found that entertaining. The end was horrible and thoughtless and really the book at times did not hold my interest. Throw in the good with the bad - I rank this an average book. RATED C"
5,Dottie West,"I love country music and this is a great cd. I would recommend all who love Dottie, to buy this and enjoy."
3,"No, you're wrong","Why are Smashing Pumpkins fans unable to have an objective opinion. It seems like every little insignificant noise Corgan and co puts onto cd is hailed as genius. The same applies to Radiohead, Pearl jam and Tool. Now i have nothing against these bands, particularly the Pumpkins who created some of the finest Alternative rock of the 90s. But seriously with nearly 30 tracks this album is about 85% fools gold. I don't think i've ever had to use the skip button as much as i did on this album. You feel me?"
2,Unintentionally Humorous,"One reviewer here sums up this confusing musical presentation by describing it as an ""opus"" in one sentence and ""unfocused"" immediately thereafter. Wait til the valium kicks in. Thank God Amazon has the preview feature."
2,I'll take ludicrously overblow ego-driven albums for $200 Alex,"Call me paranoid, but I think, I THINK, this band and album are just a tad pretentious.And where the hell is that ""Bat"" Song?Helpful Votes Prediction: Low"
5,The Quintisential Alt-Rock Album,"This is the greatest work of the Smashing Pumpkins, but also the most amazing work of a generation of musicians--the 1990's alt-rock group. Nirvana, Pearl Jam, etc. may have produced extraordinarily influential works but none can match the sheer power and beauty of MCIS. The creativity and amazing production work speaks for itself. A masterpiece."
5,One of the greatest albums of all time,"This 2 disk album is one of the only 2 disk albums to come out in the 90's filled with all brand new material. Every song is worth listening to. Billy Corgan is an amazing musician and has proven it once again with this album. This cd is definatly worth buying. Its probably the last show of a quality band, with extremely impressive guitars and drums backing it. This album is a glimps at what alternative music should sound like."
5,A Pumpkins Album for Everyone,"This album is probably one of the best Smashing Pumpkins recordings ever made. It does not display merely one sort of musical style; no, it goes from the intense, metal driven ""tales of a scorched earth"" to the instrumental title song ""mellon collie and the infinite sadness."" The singles that came out for this album are very good, and they deserve the attention they got. But after getting this album, you will see that the other songs are joys just waiting to be discovered. ""thru the eyes of ruby"" is a masterpiece, and though it is not a single, it should be the first song you listen to. ""porcelina of the vast oceans"", ""to forgive"", so many others are also worthy. Buy this album if you like the Pumpkins, maybe even if you don't. You won't be disappointed."
5,ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME,"I've had this album since it came out but finally decided to take the time to write a review on it now. It's one of my favorite albums. I could listen to it over and over again and go through wave after wave of emotions every time. Love, hate, desperation, ecstacy, inspiration, serenity, sadness, joy, and independence are just to name a few. The Smashing Pumpkins will forever be musical geniuses. Their entire sound is an immaculate masterpiece of beautifully mixed feelings and ideas. They are like no one that has ever existed and no one will ever be like them, nor will any other album ever be quite like Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness."
2,Infinite Sadness Upon First Listening,"The packaging is exquisite. Beautiful artwork and interesting liner notes from Billy Corgan. But this is about the music. I have waited to get this album on vinyl for years, and I hate to tell everyone that the quality of this (my) vinyl is horrible. I have only listened to half the tracks but can confirm that Zero, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Here Is No Why, (An Ode to No One), and X.Y.U. all appear to have weird clicks and skips in the tracks. From my listen, it seems that quieter songs such as Thirty-Three and Stumbline play fine. Never experienced anything like this.Hope everyone has better luck, but back to the iPod for me I guess."
2,Over reaching CD set,"Okay, I know I am going to get beat up on this review but I did buy the CD and am a fan of Smashing Pumpkins.HOWEVER every now and then, a band makes too much music, and cannot determine what is good and what is bad. This is the case with SP. Not only did they include a ton of cruddy songs on here, they also released around this time period a 5 cd set of 'b sides'. SP was just making music to make music. And it is all too apparent. 1979 is a great groov, but there is nothing to hook it to on this recording. It is a sad recording. Buy the single 1979 and save money."
2,Pretentious,"The Smashing Pumpkins are quite possibly the most pretentious band of the 90's. With their odd artwork and peculiar song titles they often pretend to be something other than a rock band. Guess what? They're just a rock band! As annoying as I find Billy Corgan's voice, I thought Siamese Dream was a dreamy and beautiful record. So where does it all fall apart in MCIS? Around the middle of disc 1, and it's just as dreary on disc 2. There are some hidden gems, such as 'thirty-three' and '1979', but 'tales of a scorched earth' is absolute dreck. Sounds like Billy is screaming loud about nothing. However, this is an album loaded with memorable songs, some of the best the Pumpkins have ever done. If this had been a single album, with say, eleven or twelve songs, it would have eclipsed the genius of Siamese Dream. As it is, MCIS is a two hour epic journey through numbing noise."
3,Could've been one cd,There is an albums worth of 5 star music on here. That being said there is a lot of junk in between.
5,ONE of the best,if you like the smashing pumpkins then you will love this cd it is one of my favorites it has a mixture of their heavy rock and thier soft melodys i have liked this cd since i was in the 2nd grade it is the best
5,"Smashing, baby!","This album will probably go down as the pinnacle of Billy Corgan's career (along with, y'know, those other Pumpkins James Iha, D'Arcy, and Jimmy Chamberlain). It's rather hard to classify this double-CD set, not because it jumps styles, but more that it forms its own. Too poetic for punk yet too strong for art rock, Corgan's music and lyrics have a mix of both honesty and mystery. I personally feel the strongest tracks are ""Zero"", ""1979"", and the song that describes my life better than any other, ""Bullet with Butterfly Wings"". Yes, those are also pretty much the biggest hits of the album, but I take that more as a sign of encouragement that people actually listened to the best songs. Oh yes, also buy Siamese Dream, the other high point of SP's strange journey. The two albums fit together like...well...I guess just two things that fit together perfectly. Until next time, kiddies."
2,"1/4 Great, 3/4 utter trash.","To be honest, for over a year I thought this was one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Looking back, however, I only really listened to about 9 songs. There is an awful lot of filler (and even more with the reprehensible box ""The Aeroplane Flies High) and Corgan only exhibits brief flashes of genious in such songs as ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"" and ""To Forgive."" The great songs (mostly the ones issued as singles) are very outweighed by filler, or pretentious cheese. Most of the second disc is a waste, track 2 is one of the best Pumpkins songs ever but most of the disc will rarely be read by your laser. If you wanna shell out this amount of cash for a few great songs, more power to you. But there are many better albums out there, ""Mellon Collie"" is by no means essential."
4,mellon collie &the infinite sadness,"Nice heavy weight vinyl,inserts and artwork truly amazing.I m not going to play it because I already have the music. It is a nice collectors Item."
4,Classic prog-rock album,"While some albums from this genre (and time) haven't held up well to the ravages of time, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness still pulls one's attention in and won't let go until the last chord is just an echo radiating from your speakers."
5,One of the best albums of the 90's,"This is a terrific CD. The *five* released singles are all great, and unlike anything else at the time: ""Tonight, Tonight"", ""Zero"", ""Bullet with Butterfly Wings"", ""Thirty-Three"", and ""1979."" Which is reason enough to buy the album. And most of the other songs, esp. on the first side, aren't filler, they're also amazing material. This is probably Billy Corgan's best work, although Siamese Dream is also a great album - these are two of the best albums of the 90's. Corgan's voice isn't ""great"" by the usual standard, but it's interesting and unique - just like the songs."
4,Genius!,"This CD is amazing. It is so emotional and textured. When listening, I often find myself staring off into space. A word of warning though-this CD is VERY depressing. It can seriously touch you deep down into your soul by tapping all your emotions with a sort of divine simplicity."
5,Still loved... years later,"I was in high school when this album came out, and honestly wanted it just because everyone else did. My parents got it for me and I swear it never left my CD player (except to change to the other disc) my entire high school career. I was never a Smashing Pumpkins fan until hearing this album, but it was love at first listen. Mellon Collie is unique as it doesn't all sound the same, and there are songs that will bring tears to my eyes. I've long since worn out the discs, but now have it downloaded onto my iPod, and ""Tonight, Tonight"" will be the first song that my fiance and I dance to as husband and wife at our wedding next year."
5,An absolute masterpiece!!!,"Let me start off by saying that most of the reviewers here seem to be a lot younger than me. I am 41 years old, so I have listened to music for a long time. I enjoy many types and genres of music. With that being said, Mellon Collie is one of GREATEST albums ever made by any band. It is an epic masterpiece and I love all 28 songs on this classic piece of work. It ranks up there with Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"" and ""The Wall"", Metallica's ""Master of Puppets"", Pantera's ""Vulger Display of Power"" and U2's ""The Joshua Tree"" as one of the greatest, and one of my favorite albums of all time. What else can I say."
3,Hard to Rate Vinyl,"A five star album to be sure. I have fond memories of the mid nineties and this album.I was a mere 13 years old in 1995 and my brother was in college and let me hear this album.This vinyl edition is beautifully packaged and is really amazing with its art direction.The sound however is the true test and the only reason to buy this album again.The sound at times is good and at others seems weak. The worst sounding songs seem to be on the first LP.I didn't experience noise or clicks as others describe, but I always clean new records before playing.In this remasters defence, I listened to the original cd recently and thought the sound left something to be desirerd."
4,"Good addition to my vinyl collection, but not the original.","It's good to get this on vinyl stateside. It's beautifully packaged. The booklet appears to be a nice addition. I've listened to it once already. That's unfortunately why this 5 star album only got 4 stars. I am very lucky to possess the original hut release of this on vinyl as well. I bought this because i wanted one a copy i could just spin after ive had a beer or two and not fret too much. Zero is a perfect example. It is way too hot. Most of the song is on the verge of clip. This is not the case on the hut release. I actually pulled it out and compared. I didn't notice any other blaring defects. I enjoyed the soundstage of most songs and overall sounded quite good. It often reminded me of how talented and overlooked jimmy is. In conclusion, I was worried that this release might negatively affect the value of my original lp, but I am not pretty convinced it has done just the opposite."
2,Poor Quality Pressing,"I bought this reissue and was quite disappointed by the quality of sound. It's overly distorted sounding in places, has plenty of stereo image smearing and the stereo balance seems off throughout. This vinyl pressing also doesn't sound anywhere close to being as full-bodied in the low-mid range as the CD remaster, causing much of the guitar and drum tones to sound less powerful."
5,Love this album,This is still one of my favourite albums of all time. And for $5? Done! Love my Amazon MP3 app too!
4,great quality,"Got the cd in quick time. Prime condition for being used. Got all the mini books that come with original order, which was very important to me. I recommend buying from this seller. I will continue to do business with them."
3,i liked the album but...,"ok...i actually really liked this album, but i downgraded the rating because the album is a bit off balance. it's heavy all throughout...i like songs individually, but i just can't seem to listen to the entire album in one sitting. i have to mix in other songs. i would download select songs. i bought the album because it was eons before the napster/kazaa era.but a plus to the album is that it comes with cool pics that have a pre-raphaelite/rosetti/lewis-carroll-fall-down-the-rabbit-hole quality. i particularly remember the experience of listening to ""tonight tonight"" while paging through the pictures during a car ride to the countryside. i don't know - the whole thing seemed to fit. does anyone remember the music video of ""tonight tonight""? it was beautiful."
2,"Awful, but yet somehow compelling","Billy Corgan is an annoying twit who can sing much better than here (listen to Gish). The unmistakable stench of pretensious B.S. hangs over nearly every song on this album. I want to hate it, and yet, something keeps me coming back to it. Maybe it's the goofy art work. Maybe it's the interesting song titles. Maybe it's the three song stretch on disk two of ""Thirty-three,"" ""In The Arms Of Sleep"" and ""1979"" where the album really clicks. Best to listen to this one in small doses, I think."
1,Another one bites the dust!,"Thought I would get lucky and receive an ""undistorted"" vinyl copy through Amazon but to no avail. Several songs were unlistenable. I'm sending back tomorrow. I wish those few people who said they received perfect copies would post which 3rd party sellers they ordered from so maybe I could order from them and maybe get a good one but oh well. Look in your mailbox Amazon cause here it comes back to you."
3,bit of a slug,"OK, the songs which got a lot of play on the radio back in the day were in fact the handful of good songs on this hulking album. To their credit, some of these songs are quite good and I like them... but the rest of the album is so inconsistent and not up to snuff with those good tracks which were sadly anomalies. In this case, the songs which were not well suited for radio play were really not suited for any play in general and leave me bored with a bad aftertaste. I tried to get into it, but I couldn't--and believe me, I listen to plenty of bloated long albums and pieces of music which are far more successful than this one.The title is also a bit ridiculous, if you ask me."
3,Phenominal album....mediocre double album,"Now that several years have passed since the release of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, the albums signifigance is easier to put in to perspective. This album would've been a phenominal album...an album being a 13-15 track single CD. It would have been lush with melody, and chock full of songs you wouldn't forget. The fact that it is a 28 track double album takes it down a couple of notches. There are several tracks on this sprawling album that are either boring, redundant, or unnecessary. What makes it worse is that most people don't even get into the meat of the second album because they have been oversaturated with all of the other material in the album."
5,An Epic,"This is one of the greatest cd's of all time. Bar none. Smashing Pumpkins are no dought THE band of the 90's. Nobody with the exception of Radiohead has come out with consistantly terrific cd's. And Mellon Collie is no exception. Its a grand, epic CD, that is very musically diverse. It will please both bangers, and soft music lovers. The best hard songs are ""Bodies"", ""An Ode To no one"", and ""Where boys fear to tread"". There are also touching ballads like ""Cupid de Locke"", and ""Lily my one and only"". In one word I would describe this album as ""Flawless""."
1,Well-woven masterpiece,"Mellon Colloe is the ultimate Pumpkins album. I prefer the hard songs to the ballads, but my god; Corgan sure can craft some songs. Best songs: ""Tonight"", ""Bullet W/ButterFly Wings"" and ""Ode to No One"".Salut!"
1,"utter garbage, i hope to never here any more from them",The band was bearable when the singer didn't think he was a musician of the highest caliber. In the great rock and roll tradition this band has become the best parody of itself imaginable. Just complete pure garbage.
1,To the guy that dissed Kurt Cobain......,"...consider this Corgan penned lyric from one of SP supposedly classic songs ""Despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage""...hmmm, is it just me or is that the most embarrasing line you've ever heard. I'd say any self-respecting person over say...14, would think twice b4 making a lyric that bad the centerpiece of their song. And no, Kurt Cobain wouldn't go near that crap with a 10-foot pole, and neither would I.Peace"
3,Exciting that it's re-pressed; Complete miss on the remaster of Zero,"Just got through my first listen of the entire album.1) Packaging; amazing. Awesome art, solid, large casing, and two really great extra books filled with lyrics, stories, etc. The price definitely shows in these flawless extras.2) The Vinyl; pretty darn good save for the abysmal mix of Zero. It's unlistenable. Truly a horrible overcook. Maybe the 2nd press will fix the problem.Overall, I have to give this only three stars for the disaster that is Zero."
5,Best Album of the 90s,"This album is simply incredible. People say Billy Corgan can't sing but he is not only a decent singer but a brilliant songwriter. From the piano of the opening track to the end of the album there are many different styles presented. Some don't work as well as others but thats to be expected from such an ambitious and huge album. Mellon Collie proves without a doubt that the Smashing Pumpkins are one of the greatest bands of all time. The best part of this album is that it's wide variety prevents it from dragging endlessly the way many other attempts at an album of this size would do. Like the Clash on Sadinista! but in a infinitely more coherent way, the Pumpkins conquer many styles. From acoustic masterpieces like Stumblein, the techno-ish Cupid de Locke, soft melodies like Tonight and 1979, and especially their signature heavy metal in Bodies and XYU. I know its a cliche, but this is truly a ""Desert Island Album."" Every fan of music should own it."
5,musical masterpiece,"I remember buying this album when I was 11 and was blown away by it. This album was the background soundtrack to my life for years, and has a special place in my heart. Billy Corgan's lyrics are beautifully written and every aspect of the album is done perfectly. Even to this day, I listen to it and it still feels like the first time. Truly a masterpiece."
5,No sound issues & a great price compared to the UK!,"Fortunately there are none of the sound issues that others report, maybe I'm just lucky! What really seals it for me however is the price! I'm from the UK and on the amazon site there it costs a whopping 140 ($226!!). Even with international postage the US version is less than half the price.Look around before you buy!"
4,Billy and his ol' jangly walk,"There's always this apprehension with multiple albums, be they on CD or vinyl; am I getting fair value for money (...) or not? How much of this is worth it and how much is self-indulgent (...)? It's no different with this sprawling set, but happily the gems are more prominent than the garbage. My choice for standouts: ""Jellybelly,"" ""Zero,"" ""Here Is No Why"" and ""Bullet With Butterfly Wings"" all strung together on the first CD make for a churning throb that's irresistable; ""Thirty-Three,"" ""We Only Come Out At Night"" and ""Lily(My One And Only)"" are by-God SONGS and well-performed, too: and the pacing of the whole thing really works well, with the lesser stuff carried along by the cuts that suceed. If you don't want to compare this album to the Beatles ""White Album"" or ""Sandinista!"" from The Clash, then just call it Billy Corgan's indulgence and revel in what works within it. Yes, it's worth the money!"
3,Great reissue,"The album is great, most of the Smashing Pumpkins fans will agree. The reissue on 4 LPs is very nice. Black in color, of very good quality. No CDs or MP3 downloads come with it (for those who were interested to know). Some clicks are noticeable, especially on the quiet first track, but on loud songs they don't bother the ear at all. Much recommended to all SM fans.Edit: took another listen in earphones and there is something weird on Zero. Like some strange scratching noise. Hard to tell if it is because of vinyl defect or the remastered record itself. Not a huge deal breaker for me but considering the price of this thing it should have been perfect. Deducted 2 stars from the review.Edit 2: Thinking about the Zero problem and about how overpriced this set is, I may probably return it.Edit 3: Returning it. It is just not worth the money they charge for it."
1,I returned it,It's a terrible pressing of this wonderful album. Beautiful package. Inner groove distortion makes this UN-listenable. Why bother releasing this and not paying attention to the way it sounds. Garbage.
1,It's not even worth repeating . . .,"The sound near the inner grooves is godawful. It's a nice $80 mantle piece. That's about all it's good for. Pass on this one, trust me."
5,One of the Most Emotional Albums out there!!,"I actually have it in my CD player right now playing!! It is one of the best albums I have ever bought. Whenever I feel sad I can listen to the CD and feel as though I am not alone. Billy brings such emotion to music and I truely respect him for his work on this album!! Definetly 2 thumbs up!!! Peace and Pumpkins, Deanna"
5,SP's White Album,"This album is quite possibly the best album of 1995, and Smashing Pumpkins' best. Siamese Dream, is good. Gish, is good. Adore, is not so good but anyway, Mellon Collie is amazing. This CD will actually give you mood swings and flashbacks. 1979 will have you feel young again and kind of happy, and freely singing along, whereas, Bullet With Butterfly Wings will have you dark and slowly humming along. Beautiful will have you watching The Color Purple, and sipping tea. It will make you very, very sensitive, yet sad. Well, if you haven't heard this album, do not walk to get it, do not run to get it, fly and get it, or even better, float to get it, because it WILL DEFINITELY be worth your money, and you'll be listening for quite some time."
4,"Astounding, Renaissance Modern Rock","Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness plays like a moody, intricate adolescent dream. It aurally captures everything from intense angst to swollen lust without limiting itself to a typical four-piece. Instead, the Pumpkins experiment with acoustic sounds, symphony pomp, and odd pedal effects to birth an album that prides itself on its eccentricities (sometimes better termed ""weirdness""). The Pumpkins have every right to celebrate their idiosyncrasies, they've earned it with intense attention to detail and craftwork that furthered the spec of modern rock. The Smashing Pumpkins' major fault here is forgetting when to say when, allowing for cuts that distract from the epic timepieces of Mellon Collie. Best Tracks: ""1979,"" ""Thirty-three,"" ""Tonight, Tonight,"" ""X.Y.U."" Rating: 8/10"
4,NEW AGE CHICAGO RETROMANCERS,"I just listened to this collection so I am in a very good position. Well they have a layered sound 2 them. The vocals are haunt and starking. The tickets are quite exspensive, and they'll not be playing at your school anytime soon. 2 nite is rather romantic but is far from thier best tune. Catch them live if U can. They sound better that way."
4,"it is better than adore.if you like rock, you should have i","if you listen to nirvana, pearl jam or radiohead , you must have this. It is a master piece."
1,"Wasn't shipped in a box, shrink wrap torn off","I don't know if anyone else had this experience, but my shipping sticker was put directly on the shrinkwrap and sent out of the Louisville facility, sans box. I was shocked it came this way. Obviously there was cosmetic damage. In their defense, Amazon was good about getting me a replacement set out right away, it will be here tomorrow. As far as the sound goes, mine is pretty distorted throughout, most notably on the inner groove songs, but not one song sounds totally clear. I'm hoping this had something to do with damage during the poor shipping, but since the records look immaculate I feel like it might just be horrid mastering and/or pressing. No one else having sound issues? It's really one of the most distorted 180g releases I've ever heard and I was surprised to see the other reviewers praise it."
5,Pumpkins Rock!!,"Great album!! Just went to one of their ""Adore"" CD tour concerts. It was great!! Gotta get the rest of their CDs!!"
5,I've worn the discs out.,"Melon Collie is one of the best albums that i have ever heard...the first pumkins song that i ever heard was 1979, and is still one of my favorite songs. I fall asleep at night to the music on this disc...i study with it playing...i wake up with it playing...the lyrics are poetic, the music is just great, no question about it...my mom even listens to smashing pumpkins. the best tracks are: disc 1: 1)mellon collie and the infinite sadness (instrumental) 2)tonight, tonight disc 2: 3)33 5)1979 6)thru the eyes of ruby 11)beautiful 13)by starlight 14)farewell and goodnight"
5,"For me, the best rock album of 90's.","For me, the best rock album of 90's.Fourteen years later i still enjoy most of it's songs."
5,Alot of bang for the buck,I've been a fan of smashing pumpkins since I heard Drown. This double cd is packed with tons of great songs. Billy and the gang REALLY put alot of effort into this cd. Just about every song on this cd is great!
5,HOW CAN ALL THE SONGS BE SO PERFECT?,"just like a prolonged version of siamese dream with more sentimental & sweet feelings, want noise?here comes [zero] want ballard?here comes [beautiful]. it's a total loss if u still haven't checked it out."
5,This is the definitive Smashing Pumpkins album...,"it eclipses even Siamese Dream. This is one of the few good things that came out of alternative, but it also has metal and soft songs on it. I cannot recomend this album enough, it never gets old. If you are a true music fan, you should do yourself a favor and by this c.d. I have to agree with starla. This is one of the best albums ever. Billy is a genius, and this album made me a believer. Thank God this album came out."
4,Good Music From An Iconic Band,Classic Smashing Pumpkins sound. So many hits on one album. Songs like 1979 defined an entire generation ands plays in the soundtrack of our lives.
3,Could have been better,"This is my favorite SP album, so I was really excited about this box set being released. It didn't start out well, since Amazon shipping it WITHOUT a box! Seriously, it was wrapped in shrink wrap and sitting in the snow of my front porch. WTH Amazon?! The sound quality of the records themselves leave a lot to be desired. I'm happy to have it, but for the money, you better really love the SP."
2,Vinyl Remaster,"Vinyl isn't cut well, especially the first disc. My vinyl setup is mid-fi at best (Vintage sony TT, AT cart, Technics pre-amp/amp, pioneer speakers) and it sounds terrible. I am not expecting my mind to be blown, but it is noticebly different from every other LP I own. Makes it hard to justify spending that much money on the vinyl. 4 1/2 star album+0 Star vinyl = 2 star overall"
1,Terrible,"One listen to this man's horrible voice and you know its a disaster. People's affection for this over hyped under devilered mess is beyond me. First off, his voice is weak, horrible, off-key, annoying and unable to express any emotion what-so-ever. The songs themselves are at the most barely catchy. I suppose if one wanted to write songs that were most complex and less straight forward that would be good, that is obviously not the case here. He wants to write songs and play them yet his guitar skills are average at best. The songs don't have any punch to them at all and you can't hum these things. No melody, no groove, no reason. This is just another horrible POP(ular) band from the 90s with poor music skills (which is all too common among the mainstream. One last thing 'Alternative Music' is a market name for POP. This band is Pop and its powerless."
1,Pretentious...boring...Bad,I bought this disc not knowing anything about the Pumkins. Now I know something; they SUCK!
1,"Oh, I Get It - No, Don't Get It!","""Mellon Collie""? Oh, I get it. Cute. Well, thefirst clue that this is a dud is that most decent double albums sell at more than this one, which reflects its relative worth.There is really nothing here, as the so-called ""hits"" are poor and the filler is exceptionally poor. I guess every band deserves to put out a mediocre, self-indulgent and erratic album at least once in their career. The Beatles did it with the While Album, Pink Floyd did it with the Wall, and now we have the Reeking Pumpkins offering with Mellon Collie. So bad it's not funny. 1-star."
1,"Thank You The Darkness, Thank You Byzantine, Thank You Tesla",More Boring rock by the talentless fool who excels at sounding like a whiny Tottler.
5,1995....,"First off, I'd have to say this was the smashing pumpkins best effort, and quite possibly my favorite cd for various reasons on which upon I shall state. First reason the guitar. If you even think of being a muscisian this is an esential listen. I never realized the complexity of billy corgans musical vocabulary until i heard this. Second reason the number of single and possible singles,Standout Tracks> Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness> Zero> Bullet With Butterfly Wings> Muzzle> Porcelina> Bodies> 1979These are my favorite, plus james iha does a nice song, and finally the Third Reason, What you wouldnt expect, i really didnt expect it to sound like it did (on a good way) it is a masterpiece at it lows, but at the peaks it is undescribable for words."
5,Billie Corgan & The Infinite Brilliance,"MC&TIS Has become one of my absolute favorite albums. It is a creation on the level of ""Pet Sounds"" ""Sgt. Pepper"" & ""Dark Side of the Moon"". A rock classic, a work of great modern music. From the 'meloncholia' of the title track & it's companion piece ""Tonite Tonite"", the raging rock of ""Jellybelly"" ""Zero"" ""Where Boys Fear To Tread"" & ""XYU"", the gentle balladry of ""Here Is No Why"" ""By Starlight"" ""33"" and ""In The Arms of Sleep"" to the dreamy Alice-In-Wonderland prog-scapes of ""Porcelina of the Vast Oceans"" and ""Thru The Eyes of Ruby"" this is an epic-scale tour-de-force, perfect in every way. Keep rockin' Billy!!!"
5,INSTANT CLASSIC,"THIS ALBUM CHANGED MY LIFE. AS A TEENAGER, THESE SONGS SEEMED TO SPEAK TO ME PERSONALLY. AN ACCURATE INTERPRETATION OF ANGST."
1,Skips horribly,"The packaging is beyond amazing and it looks like a million bucks but the vinyls skip all over the place and somehow/someway it's only on songs that I truly care about. Too much money to have this poor of a pressing, returning it tomorrow....."
2,Vinyl Release: Sound Quality issues!,"As another review said, there is a TON of distortion on the Zero track. As I was listening through the album, several other songs had moments of distortion as well. I was playing the album on my AT-LP120, hooked to an Onkyo receiver with Polk speakers, so it wasn't some cheap-old turntable.Due to the sound quality issues, I'm returning my copy to Amazon. I can't justify the cost of the album when the sound quality is so bad. It is really disappointing because the box set is beautiful."
5,Mellon collie and the infinte sadness,Great album for 5 bucks had to have it!!! Timeless classic that you can't go wrong with buying! good sound too!
5,I think Mellon Collie is incredable...,"I think Mellon Collie is really incredable. From the heart-filled wales and cries of a desperate man you hear in some songs to the inhuman yells of pain and fear of staying, trapped, you hear in Bullet w/Butterfly wings. Mellon Collie is really amazing... It's a CD sung from the depths of Billy's heart and soul, a picure of life and death."
5,The Smashing Pumpkins of epic proportions,"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the pinnacle album for the Smashing Pumpkins. All the variety of the music as well as the length of the album contribute to its greatness. Highlights of the album are the epic ""Porcelina of the Vast Oceans,"" the pop hit ""1979,"" and the rage focused rock anthem ""Bullet with Butterfly Wings."" This album is definitely one that should be in everyone's collection!"
1,Disappointed Christmas,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas this year. He opened it and was so excited because he is a big fan of the Smashing Pumpkins. Well, he took it apart and started playing the music and this is where it gets disappointing. Some of the songs skipped, there were black blobs on two of the records so they wouldn't even play, and scratches. I would not advise in purchasing this product. HUGE disappointment!"
3,Where is the research to back it up?,"Although I enjoyed reading the book and agreed with most of its premises, I was disappointed by the lack of references on the research backing up his recommendations. I am sure they will mostly make sense to many people, however it would have been a lot more powerful if he could have cited back up research and studies.Another annoyance (at least for me) was the constant use of examples based on his 2 kids (now adults). At the end I was under the impression that all his recommendations were based solely on his own personal experience raising his family. Not sure how unbiased he can be in this assessment.I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and did not spend my own money on it."
3,nuggets of ???????????????,"while i found the book generally interesting, it was quite apparent the author has a difficult time relating his ideas to the more common amongst us. while we would all love to take our children to paris, putting them on the metro to 'discover' is not something most can do...or would want to do.the authors insight on the value and potential of creative intelliegnce is long overdue. that alone makes the book a good read"
4,Fit is BIG but so am I,"I ordered the amber and they are definitely yellow (not amber)-Lenses are really big! Fit is good on me - though I have a big head/nose. Will be too big if you have a smaller face (probably even if you have medium)-Really like how there is no frame to impede your vision.-They do fog up a bit but only if I am really working hard and it is cooler out. Likely will not be a major problem.Overall, I really like them. I use them as driving glasses, and when I hike (see better and protect eyes from branch pokies)However, I only recommend for people with big heads (small/med = no no)"
1,$25 for defective vinyl I can't exchange!,"This review isn't about the band, who are fantastic. It's about a damaged $25 double album I can't return. I never dreamed I had to open a brand new vinyl lp before playing it in order to check it for damage. Decided to spin it today after installing the new Shure cartridge I purchased on a new Technics headshell I bought. Opened the package, removed the first album and what do I see? Serious scrape marks on the first several tracks. Premium vinyl pressing indeed! I have pictures of the damage and it's obvious by the damage pattern it's something that I'm not capable of doing. Buyer beware."
5,Greatest Hits: Journey,I like the songs - their beats - and especially the tales they tell. This is a great group to listen to and I am glad to have it in my collection of a group's greatest hits.
5,Free cloud upload,"I purchased the actual CD for my collection, and recieved an email at the first of the year enforming me this CD had been loaded to my cloud player. COOL!"
3,Gets the job done,"It locks up pretty tight. I used it to move logs around in the fire and I may have messed up the positive locking mechanism. Either way, it works for the simple tasks at-hand, and I wouldn't mind swinging it like a weapon if need be = ...clean it, the sand gets in the twist and fold sections...crunchy!"
1,don't get,used this shovel on my last camping trip. had to dig a trench to divert rain water away from my tent. the handle bent on the second dig.
1,Play Toy,"Shame on you, Coleman!Lock collar is made of cheap metal. Without it this shovel is junk. Within three minutes of light use the lock collar buckeled and now will not keep the shovel locked in place. I could probably put a washer on it to fix it but I think I will send it back and purchase something I can count on. I understand the cost is only 10 dollars but it is advertised as a reliable light duty shovel. It should be advertised as scrap metal."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS POS,I got this shovel to take with me on a back country rafting trip for 7 days. It lasted exactly one night. The locking mechanism broke rendering the shovel useless after the first night. This was used primarily for taking care of business in the back country without leaving a mess if you know what I mean. I almost threw it in the river and was irritated I had to pack the sucker out. It went strait in the trash when I got home. Coleman should be ashamed to sell this cheap piece of crap made in China. I would give it zero stars if I could. Buy another because this one sucks.
1,Broke and haven't even used it.,"I opened the box to find out that the shovel won't even lock. It just flaps in the wind. Coleman is a great company, but why make an item that has let so many people down. It works great now that I have stick welded the shovel locked open. Coleman sure looses points for this item."
1,Very disappointed,"Coleman has managed to screw up one of the most ingenious and simple designs ever envisioned by man. This shovel (a.k.a. ""e-tool"" or ""entrenching tool"" by the military)had been on my hit-list for a while. The design is so simple, there's not a lot that CAN possibly go wrong. Enter the Coleman folding camp shovel. For it's maiden mission, I headed out to the remove a well-rooted shrub from a grave headstone. Not a huge job. PITIFUL craftsmanship with this shovel...bent up horribly from light digging work. Buy a surplus e-tool, instead. That's the same EXACT thing, only mil-spec/ quality construction. Shame on you, Coleman, for putting your name on this piece of garbage."
1,Garbage,"If you want a real tri-fold shovel, shell out an extra 3 dollars and go to your local military surplus store. The locking ring literally broke apart, and the handle bent without a fight."
3,You get what you pay for,Not bad for the price. However I can tell that this isn't going to last a long time. It feels kind of flimsy and the locking mechanism seems like it will jam up pretty easily. For under ten bucks it will get the job done but if I was planning on going camping very often and needed something really durable I would probably go with the Gerber E-Tool. I think the Gerber is probably more versatile as well.
3,OK Folding Shovel For Light Jobs,"This Coleman ""Folding Shovel"" is OK for the primary purpose I bought for, as an emergency shovel to keep in my car for removing snow or dirt if I get stuck. It would likely be a bit disappointing and inadequate as a camping shovel. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Small Size; as advertised, this does fold into a very manageable size+ Versatile; the head can be positioned as a shovel or hoeCons -- ""Saw""; the two saw areas along the shovel blade are not at all sharp or saw like at all- Shaky; even when fully extended and tightened, there is a good bit of play in the movable partsMisc -* No case or cover comes with itWhile not an outstanding piece of survival gear, it still has a place in my trunk but I will likely look for another brand for my other cars.CFH"
1,terrible,"I bought this shovel for a moose hunt in Ontario Canada back in fall. Not only did I break it in the first 5 seconds of use but I didn't even get my hole dug. This thing is a piece of garbage, and I would not suggest this thing to anyone ever. Cheapest POS you've ever used. If you bought one already I'm very sorry for your loss of 10 bucks. I have my eyes set on the crovel extreme."
1,Not as Described,Besides the seller sending the wrong size and color..this is thin cheap material..threads are already coming out along the seams..would never buy again
4,W...O...W!,"I'm not much of a fan of artist albums of this content, but I made this one exception after hearing Anthony Warlow on the Jekyll & Hyde Complete Work. I paid a pretty penny for this CD, but I have to say that it was quite worth it! Anthony's talent is amazing; he really has some of the best singing AND acting skills I think I've heard in ages. His accents and clarity are both flawless; you don't need the lyrics in front of you to be able to understand what he's singing. On the more operatic numbers like ""Fate"" he manages to make it enjoyable even for non-opera fans like myself; on the jazzy ""New York"" numbers like ""Manhattan,"" he changes his style to suit the song-- it really does seem like different artists at times on the songs! His rendition of ""Bui-Doi"" brought tears to my eyes, and I was laughing out loud at ""I Am a Pirate King"" and ""On the Boards."" Best to hurry and track down this album if you haven't yet! It's worth it!"
4,Young Buffalo Bill,"A great movie, starring Roy Rogers as Buffalo Bill. I love anything about Buffalo Bill, and who doesn't like Roy Rogers?"
3,Fair Weather Screen House,"This screen house goes up easily enough, However the slanted sides are not coverd by the roof and the seams in the roof are not reinforced very well. This makes it a place where you can get away from bugs as long as they do not follow you in through the doors that are a little hard to manage. If you want to sit outside in the rain however you will find yourself looking for a spot where for reasons of wind direction or roof drip patterns happen to be dry. So it will work well in the yard and not as well camping. Not a bad price thoughUsed one week"
2,Windless,"Great tent as long as there is no wind. A 10 mph wind twisted two of the support poles around which collapsed the side. Called the company looking for a replacement or a refund and thay wanted me to ship the unit back to them, at my expense, to see why this had happened. Once I realized the expense of returning the tent I decided against sending it back. I set the tent on the side until our next garage sale and bought a Coleman. What a difference."
3,Eureka Hexagon Screen House just OK,"This screen house was a bit smaller than I expected. It's good material and very sturdy. One negative is that is was a bit difficult to put together. The poles were very hard to get into the top piece, where all the poles meet. We had to push, hammer, and shove to get them to ""click"" into place. Not the easiest thing to do! A bit aggravating!So it took much longer to get it up, than expected."
4,Eureka Hex Screen House - great item,We just recently use this screen house for the first time. It was easy to set up and kept the mosquitos out and our grand children had no problems getting in and out using the zipper. The next time we use it we are going to set it up closer to our camper awning to make it easier to eat in a bug free area. Rugged screen room and the tent pegs that came with it work real well to anchor it down.
2,Eureka Hexagon - No Floor,I was disappointed because I was looking for a tent with a floor and this tent does not have one. The description stated the tent had a floor and the picture depicts a floor. The tent has absolutely no floor.
1,allergic,This product gave me a serious rash. I sure was hoping it would be a help for my pores. Then I waited just a few days too late to return it.
3,So-so mask,"I've used this product 4-5 times and honestly I don't see the difference afterwards. The application is thick and that makes it hard to get a ""thin even layer"" around your whole face. This did not dry out my face or cause me to break out, but it didnt seem to have any benefits either. Overall it is a nice ""mud mask"" just for the sake of giving you and your friends something to do on a boring night."
3,Could be better,"The book is just a gathering of legal forms, which is pretty much what I expected. However, in order to use any of the forms in the book, you must type them into your computer. There is no place online where I can get the forms and modify to my liking, which is ridiculous, because surely the book was created using a computer. I'm sure the author would want to charge extra money to get the forms already in an electronic format, but that's just greedy to me. This book isn't of much use other than knowing your forms will pass the legal requirements and it takes a bit of needless extra time to recreate on the computer what the author has already created for you. My rating would be much higher if I didn't have to waste time re-typing someone elses work that I'd purchased."
1,Almost Got Screwed and the Seller knows whats up!!!!!!,I thought man what a deal on a fisfinder and thats what it says garmin 300c fishfinder. But somewhere in the finest of print its a dvd. You should be kicked out of here so fast it would make your head swim. This is what screws up the internet. People screwing other people out of their hard earned money.Jeff Elmore
1,Worst 20 bucks spent,"Many errors in this book. Some are spelling (annoying), some are wrong answers. I bought this book a week before taking the test, half way through it I had to put it down and go back to Lammle. I guess one way this book helps is you can test your knowledge by spotting their mistakes."
2,Not as described,The description says these are velcro adjustable. These are not velcro adjustable. They have the cheap plastic snap strips. Otherwise they seem OK.
2,"not a good price, for a mediocar product.","Cabinet LEDs work better, are slimmer and brighter (dimable by tape, plastic film or dimmer switch.)two of these barely lit my 30 gallon. was not happy with them."
4,Great find!,"My family and I LOVE this show, and I grew up watching this. It is such a treasure to have a little piece of memorabilia to read through."
3,Not a white but a pink family!,"The Diff'rent Strokes DVDs (Season 1 and Season 2) were advertised as new, but when they reached me, all corners of the covers looked worse than ANY of the few used DVDs which I have ordered from you over the years.In addition, I found the picture quality wanting. In many scenes the white people have such highly colored complexions that their faces can only be described as ""hot pink.""As far as contents go, most of the episodes are as cute as I remember them although I find Charlotte Rae's antics and voice sometimes a little difficult to take. I know I am alone with this criticism because everybody else LOVES Mrs. Garrett.Looking at the practically perfect family life of the Drummond family, it is difficult to believe that all of the children of the show had such troubles after the series closed. For all the joy they gave to their audiences over the years, one would have wished that Dana, Gary and Todd would have lived ""happily ever after."""
3,Average,"The item comes in 3 discs, but unlike 1st Season series of Diff'rent Strokes lacks important features like subtitles and extra languages.A pity when sold worldwide!"
3,Different Strokes,I've always enjoyed Different Strokes as a kid. What saddens me watching it after all these years is how life has turn out for the characters.
2,Highly and bitterly dissapointed,"Had no problem with previous perchased dvd through amazon, but we ordered different strokes through these guys and the discs keep freezing half way through episodes. Not Happy :("
1,I thought I was buying Diff'rent Strokes...,"...Not HELLO LARRY!What a crock! They pop up like every other episode!The only plusses: the slumber party with the Eastland girls and hearing Mr. Drummond say the word ""gonads."""
4,Growing up Catholic,"Based on the book I find that my experience was not as unique as I had thought. The book captures the essence of growing up Catholic, the acceptance without thought of the teachings of the church, the Baltimore Catechism and the church cultures were beyond belief. My children who have not been the beneficiary of a Parochial education look at me with wonder as if to say ""what were you thinking"". It was a grand trip down memory lane and would recommend it to anyone who was a child of the 50s and 60s going through Parochial School."
2,Not What I Thought,"I bought this book because I thought it would be pictures of the outdoors. Pictures of Lighthouses, waterfalls, the Soo Locks, the bridges up north, and of course the great lakes. There are maybe 10 pictures of these things and the rest are of people hanging out doing diffrent things. So if your looking for a book with great things Michigan has to offer this one is not it."
1,MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BOOK THAT TELLS YOU ALL ABOUT THE STATE THIS ISN'T IT. WHAT YOU GET HERE ARE PICTURES OF UNINTERESTING PEOPLE WHO COULD BE FROM ANY STATE OF THE UNION AND NOTHING UNIQUE TO MICHIGAN.A FEW PHOTOS OF STATE AREAS ARE HERE BUT NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE THE BOOK WORTHWHILE.
4,don't you just love this cover?,"this cd is very nice, i love this cover! it makes you want to buy it, my favorites are dont be an island, ebb tide is good too, and the famous if i could, a quiet storm favorite of mine, and you got the move, very nice cd, listen to the samples..."
1,Can't I select 0 stars?,"Oh my god that was awful. It's worse than awful, it's pathetic. These guys come across about as sincere as used car salesmen, and have all the talent of a backstreet boy."
3,Body,I order body like in the picturesin the same colorsi get clear bodyno comment in the item that the body is clearI very disappointed!!!!
1,better than kim waters?? are u sure about that??,"There is no way that marion meadows is better than kim waters on soprano sax! He sure does not display that ""heap"" of talent on this CD. He has had better CD's in the past. Traxx 1-5 really bore me! IF I WERE U ID CONSIDER KIM WATERS ""In The Name Of Love"" over this ""players club"" thing going here..."
5,Beautiful from Beginning to End,"I wondered how Marion was going to top ""In Deep"", well he did it!This is a beautiful CD! No ""fluff"" here. I highly recommend it!! This is the best CD I've purchased so far in 2004. Marion is performing on Catalina Island this year, I plan on being there. That is going to be a ""show""!!"
5,Classic California Rock,"This is the best greatest hits collection by The Turtles. No album fillers or retakes, just their 20 Top Hits all done in that refreshing California sound. Perfect harmonies, jangling guitars & crashing drums, what more could you want? This is highly recommended to add to any 60's rock collection."
2,Better get the originals,"This CD is a good set of the Turtles' hits, but it's a low-quality recording (and lower volume than almost any other CD in my collection), and Sundazed (and others) has since released pretty much the full Turtles catalog. The re-released originals, esp. the first five or so albums, will definitely reward multiple listening, contain the hits in their proper context, and provide numerous non-hit gems."
1,recycled boxes smell awful indefinintely,"I was so happy to be able to purchase recycled Bankers Boxes. I like the brand, especially the heavy-duty version of their boxes. But the recycled boxes are stinky. And they've continued to be stinky for more than a year. If you can keep the boxes in a separate storage area, they will work for you. Otherwise, I do not recommend."
3,"Yes, They stink. So make sure you aren't storing them nearby","I have no problem with the quality of the boxes structurally or how easy they are to put together. My main issue is that the recycled ones stink, especially when it is humid. They stink of a puke-like smell... Consider yourself warned. If you are storing them in formal storage or an attic, they're fine. If they are going to be next to your desk or somewhere you work -- be prepare for ""What's that smell?"""
2,Boxes smells bad,"I got the boxes over two weeks ago, however they still have a bad stale odor to them. I smelled it when I got them, and figured it would disapate...but no it doesn't."
5,Strong & Recycled,"Great product at a great price. Bonus that it was recycled. Boxes were easy to build, strong and stacked well."
3,Great coat but buttons come off,Every button fell off and had to be sewn back on. This is a great coat but be prepared to just take the buttons off and sew them back on.
4,PURPLE GRAPE,"The only thing not perfect about this beautiful, nicely tailored, great quality jacket is it's color description. It is really purple, not as I imagined GRAPE would be. Good value, anyway!"
1,excessively high price,Why do 12 pairs are $ 92.28 and 1 pair costs $ 3.95? Are too expensive the 12 pairs compared with the price of 1 pair
4,Overall Very Good,"I read this book for one of my public policy class. Peter's book summarizes the key issues in a lot of areas of public policy. The book provided a good history in different topics of interest and then provided a good summary of the key debates and controversies in those topics. I found myself constantly doing more research on topics that interested me. My one major complaint is that at points the book got very dry, but that's more a reflection of my inability to sit down for long than of the quality of the book.My one minor complaint is a source he cited for the Energy and Environment chapter. He says on page 382, ""Only about 10 percent of [toxic waste] is disposed of safely."" If you look at the citation in the back, it is from a 1985 publication. Highly dated!But overall, I'd say get this book because you'll learn a lot."
1,Deeply disapointing,"I grew up in a Bilble believing family. Unlike most fundies I have actually read the book, not just taken fortune cookies from the pulpit. (BTW - anyone who thinks God is against killing the unborn has NOT read the OT).Having said that I lost my faith because of an inability to square what the Bible says with what I can clearly see for myself (""I do not believe the God who gave us this magnificent brain did not intend for us to use it""). I have been on a constant quest for a true connection with God ever since. The fact that I would even look to this money-grubbing ... for guidance is proof of my determination. This book is a confused mish-mash of pop physcology, bad advice and misunderstood scripture. Sadly many ""public Christians"" will eat it up because it reinforces their own narrow bigotry. For a man trained as a minister this book is deeply disapointing - even Dr. Phil could do better."
1,great book,"great book if you are a moron that is.my god what a pathetic creature pat robertson must be.its premise seems to be that the steps to spiritual revival is ""hate your neighbor"".chapter after chapter seem to revolve around finding ""non believers"" and having them arrested or deported under false charges if need be.what kind of person writes a book like this? and what kind of editor allows the syntax and spelling errors found in this horrid little pamphlet?"
5,Ten Sides of Murray,"In the age of boy bands..., Ty Murray reminds us that the seemingly long lost art of ""singer/songwriter with something to say"" is alive and well in the Arlington/Dupont Circle music scenes. Musically, Treefort, is remenisent of Tom Petty, Mathew Sweet, and the Band Standard Deviation. Melodic hooks, thought provoking lyrics, and stellar guitar work hightlight this release. Listen closely and you'll soon find yourself on a lyrical journey that will demand further review. ""Fallen Angel"" and ""She Goes Her Own Way"" rock with urgency yet Murray really shines when he goes at it alone on ""After My Time"". ""Borrowed Life"" presents the age old sentiment ""you promised me a better life"", but alas, Murray responds with ""I promised I'd lie to you, I kept my word"". Varied yet cohesive, Treefort and this relatively unknown artist deserve more recognition. Check it out."
1,Save your money,"This DVD is like a promotional video more than an exercise video: I was hoping to have more than the five minutes worth of exercises at the end after wading through a long lead up of boring testimonials. Horn has followup videos, which might have more actual movement, but after viewing the first and feeling cheated, I don't want to take the bait for what I consider a limited exercise program.I asked for a refund, which took several weeks before even I heard back from them.. Once I got the UPS return sticker, Amazon refunded quickly after that.A far better video is Yoga by Anne Pringle Burnell, which is chair exercises for the mind and body and is part of the Stronger Seniors Workout Program. All age groups can benefit from the get-go any of Burnell's videos which offer an excellent demonstration of many more exercise than Horn did with his."
2,Just what I was looking for -- but lacking,"I have been looking for a bag like this for months, but after buying the bag, I was sadly disappointed. The shoulder strap, with its velcro closure, is not the smartest idea if you plan on taking any valuables like a wallet, credit cards or cell phone with you on your journey. The strap is also short, and for someone as small as I am, that's pretty short. The overall size of the pouch itself is perfect -- exactly what I was looking for. I also really like the clip closure instead of the velcro or magnetic closures that so many bags have these days. I plan on keeping the bag, but sewing the strap closed so that the velcro can't be separated."
4,not a bad bag,this bag has turned out to be quite functinal. I bought it as a quick fix really for a trip i was taking that involved me having to have my pda and some paper work with me all the time. and this little bag really worked out well. It's a little smaller than i thought but still a very functional bag.Highly recommended.
1,I think they need more market research,"After watching this show a few times, it is obvious that anyone who is a contestant isn't smart enough to read. I can't imagine that the people who don't qualify are any smarter. They should have released this as an audio book, or better yet, a pop-up book."
4,Phone-a-Friend and tell them to buy this book!,"An excellent book about one of the biggest phenomenons in the history of television. Great facts and great questions. Only complaints: more ""writing"" on show info (only 30 pgs or so - the rest is sample questions), and pictures would be nice."
3,Too many questions !,"Out of the 200 pages in this book, 174 are all question pages.But the 26 pages of info are superb, from Regis first hearing of theBrittish show to ABC buying the rights from Britains ITV, it's all here. But there are no pictures which is a bit misleading from it's glossy cover, not so much an official guide but more of a quiz book. My advice, go and buy the Brittish guide, lots more show info and laden with glossy pictures."
4,For the show's fans.,"This book generally contains fascinating tidbits about the most popular game show on television today. However, it did not include as many trivia questions as I assumed there would be. Some questions are at an easy level while others are more difficult, similar to those that actual contestants answer on the game show. Unfortunately, the questions fail to cover a broad range of topics. I agree that too many trivia questions focus around the media, even television shows that I never even saw. But if you enjoy the show, then this makes a good collector's item. YOu'll have a more enjoyable time answering the questions that appear on the show instead of the ones in this book."
3,OK,"This book is not as great as it sounds. Michael Davis barely gives you a ""behinds-the-scenes"" look. It's very boring too. There are pages and pages of questions and the answers are there. I don't recommend this to anyone, except the WWTBAM fanatic Rosie O'Donnell."
2,If you like REAL trivia....,"....this is not the book for you. I did not like this book at all. I was looking for a general-knowledge-trivia book and this was not it; it has way too many questions about TV shows, and the rest of them sound for a fifth or sixth grader student. If you are American (because it also has tons of only-North American issues) and just started to play trivia (looking for an easy one) you might like this though... otherwise I would recommend you to look for another trivia book."
4,Masterful but flawed with needless eroticism,"We who teach and practice massage daily are indebted to Gordon Inkeles for popularizing this gentle art. His books are in a class by themselves and have helped so many people discover massage. That said, I must ask the question that keeps popping up in professional massage circles: why so much emphasis on sex? The blonde on the cover, for example, appears repeatedly inside the book in a short skirt. What does that have to do with massage?I'm torn saying this because his books are truly beautiful once you get past the sexy stuff. In book form you can't find a better massage teacher. Just be aware that there is a less erotic alternative.Anyway,"
5,Kudos for Gordon Inkeles' latest Super Massage Book,"Kudos for Gordon Inkeles' latest Super Massage Book. Unlike other similar efforts that I've seen in the bookstores, Mr. Inkeles' books are always much more than reference works or how-to books. They are well-written, engaging, humorous and informative.The latest (Super Massage) is also expansive. It concerns overall health and our external environment. It teaches yogic stretching, better sleep, and better sex. It also provides anti-aging techniques such as smoothing wrinkles and preventing stress. It could well be Inkeles' best book yet."
5,An absolute masterpiece!,"Jazz at its highest state!Every single solo on this album is a wonder, and every arrangements are one-of-a-kind pure genius.Sophistication yet down-to-earth, tragedy with humor, briliant sarcasm, sensitive interplay, from swing to free jazz.I could write a book about this album. Best Kurt Weill rendition ever."
5,Unveiled Hope reviewed,"This is an execellent and simple discussion of the contents of the last book of the Bible, The book of Revelation. Instead of trying to do what many commentators try, Scotty Smith does not attempt to make the content of his messages support or provide a millenial viewpoint. Rather he seeks to explain the words and images in the book to show what the real hope of the Christian faith is. The book came out of a series of sermons preached to a group of people who were planting a church that was reaching many budding musicians with the gospel of Jesus Christ.Along with the messages, well known Christian musician Michael Card appends many chapters by sharing his thoughts on how his music album with the same title as the book came into being. This is a valuable commentary that the average layman can understand and be edified by. I highly recommend it to your readers."
2,Not worth it,"Luckily I bought this book used and didn't pay full price for it or I would have been extremely upset. It's nothing more than a small picture book with some very obvious blurbs about the tv shows it covers. There's nothing new or insightful in most of the blurbs. The so-called timeline is confusing, because for many shows listed it's not clear what year they're talking about. It also omits a lot of shows and there's no rhyme or reason as to why some shows are in the book and some shows are not. I don't recommend it."
2,a bit on the annoying side,"Gordon Lynch raises some important questions, however, I found his style a bit annoying. He seemed a little smug and tried to be flip and chatty about what I think is a rather serious topic. I got the feeling that he wasn't as far along in this process as he thought when he put pen to paper and that the book actually helped him to process his ideas. I'm still not sure what he DOES believe and I'm always a little wary of people who define themselves in negative ways (even the title is about losing something and moving away from something). I also felt he offered a false choice--either be a right-wing, uncritical evangelical or be an enlightened, open-minded free soul. I'd like to think there's a middle ground."
4,Product Quality,"The quality of this product is generally very good. However,the bottom of the heel came off after three times normal use. I suggest a better bonding to enhanse the quality. Thank you very much."
5,Great gift!,This is a great gift to give to a new mother. Very encouraging words for any mother who wants to raise Godly children
5,Love it!,I love this book. It gives you great ideas on how to truly love and teach your children as the Lord instructs. Elizabeth George is a great author who is not afraid to say what moms need to hear!
3,"Shoot-outs, brawls, and a little romance for Ken Maynard.","Ken and his doleful sidekick (""he's called Happy but don't let his name fool you"") are looking for Ken's old partner, Cherokee Jake, who seems to have disappeared since writing them that he had struck it rich. It soon becomes apparent that the same gang who are burning barns and stealing cattle locally may be behind his disappearance. Ken sets out to find his pal, to learn what is behind all of the marauding, and to discover the identity of the secret bandit leader. Along the way there are shoot-outs, brawls, and a little romance. This is one of the eight low budget features that Ken starred in for producers Max and Arthur Alexander between 1937 and 1940."
5,"""Spectacular Work from a Rising Star""",I own this CD and have listened to it just under 37 million times. The lyrics express a deep sorrow that touches me each time I hear it. I am waitng with bated breath to hear Mr. Simonelli's next release.
2,"I love Techno, but this one isn't juts it!","I bought it brand New, for 17,98. I tought there are super tracks, as it was in Pure Progressive CD. However, I was disapointed. But, on CD I found few tracks that cought my attention. For now only I will be buying music by one track in Amazon Mp3 Store. You can find the same album and download just few, or one track that you do like and spend only $ .99 Rather than whole CD for 20$. =( I don't recomend this CD if you are DJ Becouse tracks are CUT in the end!"
1,over-hyped,"I was expecting to be mindblown by this record. I am in a post metal mode right now, buying stuff like Intronaut and The Ocean, etc. Kylesa was supposed to dazzle. Two drummers. Despite all that, sounds like rear end to me."
1,DON'T PAY 40 DOLLARS MORE!,"Just a heads up, there's only one extra track on this cd, and it's trenchtown rock (live). Otherwise, it's exactly the same except the writting on the inside is japanese. So you might be utterly dissappointed."
3,Let me tell you...,"I'm 15 years old and I've been listening to Bob Marley since I was 5. I have posters of him in my room, I listen to him most of the time. I believe I can be one of his biggest fans. The songs on this album are good but they are very played out since most of them were in LEGEND(that CD [isn't very good]!) Bob Marley has much better songs than the songs this CD gives you like for example: Burnin'& Lootin', Bad Card, Rat Race, Soul Rebel, Rebel Music, Concrete Jungle, Sun is shining, Survival, Ambushed in the night... etc. The best album I believe would be Survival if you care about politics and whats going around the world, the injustice against colored and poor people. If you barely started listening to Bob Marley this is a good CD. Until you know what Bob marley is all about then you can listen to Survival, Uprising, Catch a fire and all his other albums. I'm telling you this and I dont even smoke the herb."
1,Is this a bootleg?,"Okay, here is the major problem with this release: it is not a TuffGong/Island release. The Marley family has struggled with this reality for a long time. Because Bob's music has become so widespread and lacks the legal protections that American and European recording artists have enjoyed for decades, his recordings have gone onto the cheap market (flea markets, push carts, gas stations, etc-and now Amazon). Buying One Love only serves to strengthen these sleazy record companies and hurts reggae artists and the Jamaican economy. Look closely at the albums before you buy them. Find out what label has produced them and try to stick with TuffGong when possible."
1,One mistake in selection renders this unnecessary.,"Yet another Bob Marley ""Greatest Hits"" CD, and one that makes the big mistake of substituting the band version of ""Redemption Song"" for the acoustic solo version. Almost all artists' Greatest Hits anthologies seem doomed to have at least one blunder of inclusion or omission, but given the poignancy of this particular omission (the haunting solo version was the last cut on the last Marley album released during his lifetime), this CD must be written off as just another corpse dig by The Man. Completely unnecessary. For those shopping in the Bob Marley express lane, stick with ""Legend."""
2,good photos only,"I've previewed some pages of this book on the official site of Taschen. Then I bought this book with the thought that there would be good analysis about those great architectures,since this book entitled with ""...an architect's eye"". When I got this book I feel a little bit of dissapointment because this book is merely a collection of mostlt ""western"" architecture photos. With few analysis on these masterpieces,I suggest those who interest in real architectural books go browse Google for pics rather than buying this book."
2,No discussion or analysis - really just glorified postcards,"I ordered this book without seeing it first, and I was quite disappointed with it. I am not too familiar with the publisher, but I have just purchased ""What Great Painting Say Vols. 1 & 2"" by the publisher, and was expecting something along the lines of those books (great books, by the way).This book is basically photographs only, with bare minimum captioning (building name/location only). No other information at all. I was hoping to see commentary telling me things about the buildings, some sort of architectural evaluation or commentary.The only reason I give this even two stars is that the photographs are mostly pretty nice."
4,Love my Yellowbird,This is my all time favorite hair dryer. It's powerful and much faster than any of the others I've tried.
1,started smoking,"I bought a Yellowbird a year and a half ago because my first dryer (purchased at the professional shop) lasted more than 15 years. But this one started smelling a few weeks ago as I used it, then the on/off button stopped working. When I plugged it in today, it put out a white smoke. I immediately unplugged it and will throw it away."
3,"Anice phone with a big ""BUT""","I like this system and it has worked well for me. BUT, with a newer system now released by Motorola, you should be aware that the two are NOT compatible. So if you have to replace a single phone in your system ... Good Luck. You'll have to throw the whole system away and start over with a new system."
3,HAND PHONE,"tHE pHONE HAS GREAT RECEPTION AT GREATER DISTANCE THEN ANY OTHER PORTABLE PHONES THAT I HAVE USED. tHE ONLY COMPLAINT THAT I HAVE IS, tHE BASE DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO sUPPORT 4 PHONES EVEN THOUGH IT CLAIME TO SUPPORT 6. WITH 4 PHONS CONNECTED TO THE BASE I CANNOT USE THE BUTTONS TO ENTER CODE FOR TODAYS 1,2 3, ECT FOR MENU CHOICES"
4,MD61 5.8 GHz handset,"My family likes this handset. The speakerphone is very good, both sending and receiving. The display is easy to read and easy to program. Range from the base is excellent. We like the ability to use multiple handsets as walkie talkies. Phone casing is sturdy. It has been dropped a few times on house floor with no damage to the phone. Battery life is good. After 2 years, our original handset batteries still give us about 15 hours of talk time before having to be recharged. Finally, the shape, weight and feel of the handset fit our hands very well. Not bulky or uncomfortable. The 2nd handset we bought last month integrated into the system easily; the directions were very simple to follow.What we don't like is the same others have identified. It is frustrating that the directory from the handset does not sync up to the base or other handsets. You must program each one separately."
4,4stars....,"Excellent range. Easy setup. Clear voice transmission. Like the speaker functionality. No interference with my wireless connection. Could be happier if I could use this as a monitor (I think Unidel allows this). I am not a big fan of Moto cell phones (had 2 lousy ones) but, this household handset is very good."
3,OK extension phone,This phone works fine with the base but overall is a little expensive for just an extension handset. I did receive one that had way too much static and returned it. The replacement phone worked fine.
5,Mortrola Provides an Excellent Handset,I am completely happy with this handset and had no problems configuring it to the base station which I had purchased about a year ago. All you have to do is follow the instructions that came with the handset.
2,Some drawbacks,"1. Its charger has no locator button.2. You have to register it will base (Good part), but if don't want to use this you have to unregister it (bad part) otherwise it will show up in intercom menu.3. Shows new calls even if the another handset picked up the call (bad).4. Each phone have its own phone book and call logs ( good and bad)5. Buttons loses the polish with normal wear and tear fairly easy.By the ay mine stop worliong in 14 months, too bad customer service. I don't recommend it."
5,Really interesting,Bought for husband and he really enjoyed reading it as it gave great incite into what really made these guys tick
2,A reasonable book - but there are better ones out there,"I had a choice between this and FF Visionaries: Byrne. I picked this because Pacheco's artwork and Loeb's writing are always good. So what's the problem?Dialogue.Until Loeb takes over scripting towards the end of the book you could mistake this for an olf fashioned Image book - great art, horrible dialogue. It's certainly not terrible - but it's not great either.The great thing about this book though, is the sense that it actually takes place in the Marvel Universe, the Grey Gargoyle, the Avengers appear, as does old-time FF villain Diablo.However, at the end of the day, if you have to pick up a Marvel trade paperback, go with Inhumans, the Sentry, X-Force, Ultimate Spidey, or any of the Essential collections."
2,to cheep,"it is very thin aluminum, will bend easily, i was looking for of a mirrored heavy duty one, This one is cheep looking"
3,Looked good for a day,"Got the plate and it was perfect. Installed it on my car and after washing it 1 time, it all flaked off. It's cheap. Don't buy it."
1,really bad tag,The company also shipped me the wrong tag. This is the tag they shipped me and the decal came off the first time I pressure washed my car.
2,Cincinnati Reds License Plate,"Unfortunately, the plate is cheaply made. After my first carwash with it on, 1/4 of the Reds logo had already peeled off."
3,Where is this story going?,"Back Cover description: Antonio Silver was just too much of everything--too arrogant, too good-looking and far too sure of himself! And he made it perfectly clear that he distrusted Corinna's motives in giving up her busy life in London to care for his sick father. Corinna couldn't seem to convince Antonio that her motives were genuine, that she wasn't a gold digger...Antonio was determined to be a thorn in Corinna's side. There was no escape from his watchful presence. Tension was growing and it was only a matter of time before suspicion turned to attraction...and Antonio changed from enemy to lover!Antonio's character is typical alpha male. He seems to spend most of the book almost wanting Corinna to be a gold digger. Lots of emotion in this and a little too much dialogue about why Corinna is nursing his father."
2,"Poor quality, only a bit of fun.",Perhaps we did not get the full effect of this toy because it fell apart so fast. It was hard to follow the physical reaction of the balls when it was working. It came apart the first day it was used and didn't seem worth returning. Goggles don't seem necessary
2,Nice look but too quiet!,"This has a nice look, the buttons are placed nicely and easy to find and press but you best make sure you have absolutely nothing else going on in the house (e.g. TV, music, people talking loud) or are not in a different room or else you more than likely won't even hear it. I have two other brands, one of them from a dollar store and they're both nice and loud. I would pass on this one myself unless you live in a constant quiet environment."
4,Good Buy,"This is the only DVD/VCR Combo that I have ever owned. It is also the first one that ""upconverts"" to 720p or 1080i. As far as the upconversion, I honestly cannot tell any difference, so I leave it set on 720p. It is also kind of a pain to change this setting, since you must do it on the front panel. They really should have integrated that feature into the remote control. Other than that, it is a good machine. I have had no problems with it at all. Oh, and if you are new to HDTV like me, don't be surprised when some DVDs still have lines at the top and bottom. I thought something was wrong at first, but I found out that some movies are actually filmed at a ratio that is wider than 16:9!"
4,Nice Unit,This unit works great and the price is good. I have had only one probulem is sometimes wont play dvd I make on my compuiter.
5,they just don't get any better than this one,"I bought this album in the tape format in 1989, and replaced it later with the cd. For a non-greatest-hits album, they really just don't come any better than this one: three #1 songs and three other top tens. All that, plus the album has a really terrific non-hit ""sleeper"" track in ""Changes."" I have no problem giving this one a 5-star rating"
5,Great album,"In response to the previous review, ""Ghost In This House"" and ""The Moon Over Georgia"" indeed were not included in this album. But for obvious reasons. Those two songs had not been recorded yet. They first appeared on Shenandoah's 1990 album, ""Extra Mile"". This is a great cd and the standout song is clearly the number one hit, ""Two Dozen Roses"". What a beautiful song. Another number one hit on this album is ""The Church on Cumberland Road"". Rick Hall, one of the album's producers, didn't really care for a song about a groom running late for his wedding and therefor wasn't really for putting it on the album. It made it and became another number one for the band. ""See If I Care"", a top ten hit, is another good song. But why put ""She Doesn't Cry Anymore"" on the album? This song first appeared on their debut album two years earlier and is a great song, but why they decided to re-release it on this album is beyond me. This is truly a great album overall and was their most sucessful one to boot."
5,"If you like Creedence and want to play it, this is your book","This book basically breaks down all the chords making their near-perfect music very easy to play. I am a novice at guitar, and I found this book very helpful, some some of it is just way too advanced for me. I highly recommend it for those who want to play good music."
2,Not so happy.,"As a big CCR fan I was greatly disappointed. What really ticked me off when I realized that the whole version of Bad Moon Rising wasn't in the book, only part of it. I thought I was missing a page but no I looked at the numbers and it was in numerical order. Personally, I like to learn a whole song when I am learning to play it."
2,Business Process Implementation : Building Workflow Systems,"To clarify something that Reviewer Yves Chaix said... ""As a reference though, I think that 90% of what I learnt, I actually picked from studying the excellent documents produced by the Workflow Manufacturers Coalition (www.wfmc.com).""Readers should know that the organization in question is the Workflow Management Coalition, and the website is www.wfmc.org. The WfMC is releasing the Workflow Handbook 2001 in October 2000, by the way. This is the new definitive reference to workflow management, with particular attention to e-business and B2B integration. It includes the full Wf-XML specification and glossary."
5,Excellent,This instructional DVD is superb. Leslie Stager gives an excellent break down of massage for pregnancy. The instruction given is very clear and easy to follow. Extremely professional. Highly recommend it!
1,The agony,"This is one of the absolute worst books I have ever attempted to read. Where to start? Perhaps the forced language that makes one think the story is set in the south, but it turns out they are in California. How about the sterotyped and two dimensional characters? Or perhaps the plot, which is lackluster and transparent. Oh, the agony. I read the first 50 pages, looked here and there, and read the last two chapters. The adult theme makes this book unsuitable for children/teens, but the level of writing will bore most adults. Truly, a must skip book."
5,GREAT BOOK,"For two years now, I have been in a church and fasting was introduced to me there. I fasted in a hit or miss fashion not fully understanding fasting. I bought this book because I desire to be in obedience to the will of God as ordained through my pastor.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is struggling, needs a greater understanding/appreciation of fasting."
1,what a waste of money that was,"i got this to replace me set of german military cloth bandanas that i normally use.First of all - it feels horrible material wise. Made out of cheapo velo-jersey stuff - not the kind of material that feels nice on the skin of one's head. Secondly - its not particarly ""one size fits all"". I mean if you got head size of 11 yrs old - you will be fine. Anything bigger - it will be looking and feeling horrible enought to just throw it away. Which i did."
1,Buyer beware,Be warned: This book is an amalgamation of 'Colour and Design on Fabric' and 'Fabric Artistry' from the Singer Design series. I didn't discover this until it arrived here in New Zealand by which time it was too late and it wasn't worth the postage to send it all the way back to the US for a refund.
3,Less than Expected,"While this book is great for people with absolutly no textile experiance, it was too basic for me. The pictures may spark your creativity but the techniques are simplistic and can be found by searching free on the net. Unless you are a beginer don't bother."
4,Great Book!,Can't wait to find the time to actually get to do some of the wonderful things I've read about in the book.
5,"Its Polk, it works, what else do you need to know","Good audio imiging when placed in a 1 cuft inwall enclosure. Particularly good as surrounds and with a good sub, can play the front end too. Mid range response is strong ( a Polk quality ). The tweeter could be stronger but at this price point and for the casual audio source it fits the bill."
5,great looking better sounding,"these things rock for the price, and my wife loves that they blend in to the wall... highly recommend"
2,Overrated Speakers for Sound Quality,"I used these speakers to replace horribly sounding, ultra-junk quality Radio Shack speakers and these hardly sounded any different. Their construction was awfully close to the Radio Shack speakers, as well - cheap MADE IN CHINA quality. I think people just follow other people's reviews and are easily influenced by ""brand names"" rather than judge equipment on its own merits. I regret the purchase am now looking for better quality additional speakers. Brand names mean NOTHING when they all have their crap made by the same Chinese factories. And we wonder why everyone is out of work now and it is hard to buy quality products of ANY type!!!!!! This was my first Polk Audio purchase and I always heard that Polk Audio was really good but maybe long ago when they didn't farm their products out to the same Chinese factories as Radio Shack!!!!!! Find another brand."
1,Couldn't be worst ...,"I happened to have a copy of two editions (1992 & the 3rd : 1999) of this ... thing. Not only Mr. Miller is shallow, but confusing and his explanations are so limited that I can barelly imagine how can it be usefull. After 13+ years related with network analysis and TRUE troubleshooting, and having to help others to start in this area, there is one book I have seen of very little use : this one. The information in the book gets you nowhere.If you want better sources of information, and you have the basics on Networking (at least layer 2) I would recommend either Comer excelent book on the TCP/IP area, or Stevens/Wright TCP Illustrated series, and as a complement (or if you need detailed info on Layer 2 and Networking in general) read the amusing and excelent ""Interconnections"" by Pearlman (this authors DO KNOW what they are taking about, and it shows !!!!)"
4,Some Missing songs,"I love the Everly Bros and I wanted a complete selection of their greatest.3 songs were missing and I should have researched more carefully. I added ""Crying in the Rain"", ""Walk Right Back"" and ""Cathy's Clown"" to this collection and now it's complete."
5,A great CD collection of music and memories,"This CD is the essential Everly Brothers discography, with all of their hits included as well as some near-misses that should have been chart toppers. ""Bye Bye Love"" started the duo on the road to stardom and smash hits such as ""Wake Up Little Suzie"", ""All I Have to Do Is Dream"", ""Bird Dog""/""Devoted to You"", ""('Til)I Kissed You"" and ""Cathy's Clown"" proved that the brothers were indeed a unique and gifted act and headed for stardom. A great session of hits that brings listeners back to the dawn of rock 'n roll and unforgettable memories."
4,A blast from the past,"This too was a gift for my husband that he hasn't gotten yet. We both loved the Everly Bros., so I know we'll both enjoy this a lot."
4,Updating my review,"At first I was disappointed and frustrated with this camera, however now that I have had it for over a month, I have really come to enjoy it.Yes, it took some time to get used to all the fancy gadgets, but now that I have been playing with it, I have gotten a lot of compliments for the clarity of my pictures. I run auctions on ebay (under the same name if you want to see my pictures), and compared to that cheaper camera I talked of earlier, the pictures are 100% better.There are some things that I don't like about this camera. The software and lack of technical support are lacking. The battery slot is wobbly. Other than those issues and a little time spent playing around with the settings, I have to say that I would recommend this camera as an upgrade from a ""starter"" camera.A great value for the buck."
3,"5 for pictures and ease of use, 1 for reliability","I purchased this camera back in November. Yes, I had to buy a card, and batteries, but I was extremely happy with it. The LCD mechanism is different, but it didn't bother me. Takes beautiful pictures (and I am a beginner.)But...this camera is built out of plastic, and after only a few months, I am having mechanical difficulties. I had to send it in. The mechanical switcher quit working, and there was a crack in the battery door hinge.The optics are great, movie quality with sound (that the Olympus C740 didn't have) but the plastic construction leaves a bit to be desired. We'll just have to see how the warranty repair goes."
2,Micro focus went bad,"I've had this camera for about a year. I love the zoom and it takes nice pictures, but recently the micro (close up) feature stopped working. I sell on eBay, so this function is a priority to me. It will not focus and there are mechanical sounds inside that don't stop. So, for just one year of occasional use, it's over. I have to go out and buy a new camera. I spent about $400 on this camera and that means I paid about $33.00 a month for the use. Too much!"
1,feels like a child's toy; mirror breaks,"If you have ever held a real SLR (Canon, Fuji, Olympus, etc.) SLR film camera in your hands, don't WASTE YOUR MONEY on this thing. It feels like it is made of the same plastic used at to make the toy cameras at the dollar store. The battery cover will break after a few battery changes; the lens rattles like it is going to fall out. It is smaller and less professional looking that you might imagine.After flipping from LCD to viewfinder about 10 times, the mirror on the one I ordered began to stick.Do youself a favor...if you are considering this camera, go to W..mart and pick one up and see how it feels. Then if you still like it, come back to amazon and order it. (It is about $80 cheaper at Amazon!)."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The images are not sharp at the telephoto end of the lens. Also, very bad camera shake blur if you do not use a tripod. Only 3.2 Megapixels. You need at least 4 nowadays, especially if you want to crop or enlarge. Panasonic Lumix is about to release the FZ10 which is a 4 Megapixel camera with a Leica 12X Zoom lens with Image Stabilization. This means that you do not get blur camera shake even with handheld shots at the long end of the zoom. Wait for this one. Never buy a long-zoom camera withour Image Stabilization."
2,Blindly taking pictures,"This is probably a pretty good picture taking camera, but I can't try any of the controls because I can never see what I am taking! All my pictures are outside and the LCD (at the darkest setting) is so bright and washed out I simply point at shadows and hope I come out with what I want. The eyepiece is no better since it is mostly gray spots. The pictures I get on automatic settings are good, but I could get better composition and lighting if I could see what I was aiming at! Also, the card door keeps comes open when just brushed by the bag."
1,Never Again,"I bought this camera a couple of years ago, and had problems with the auto focus. About a year ago the battery cover wouldn't close all the way due to a broken tab in the cheesy cover. Well I just sent it in to be repaired, and guess what they want $150 to fix it. That's almost half the price of the camera for a 10 cent item and probably all of 15 minutes to fix. I won't be getting it fixed (I'll tape it shut), and I won't ever buy another camera from Minolta. Let the buyer beware. Stay away from Minolta unless you like spending your money on repairs."
5,5 STARS CAMERA,"No complaints, it's an excellent camera, after use this model you won't use the point and shoot cameras anymore."
5,Love This Camera,"I have had this camera now for over a year and have taken pictures of grandkids, landscapes, concerts, etc. and have always gotten beautiful results. The video mode worked great at an Anne Murray concert my husband and I went to - picture and sound both had good quality. My son took it to Florida for his vacation, and was happy with all the pictures he took there. I agree that when you have 10x zoom you can't get a good focused picture, but other than that I have no complaints. In fact, my grand-daughter is graduating next week and is planning on taking digital photography in college, so I bought her a Z1 to start out with. As for the simplicity of use, I had no problem using it right out of the box and I am certainly no ""pro"" (my last camera was a 110 pocket)!!! For the money, I think this camera is super for the amateur photographer."
1,will not focus with flash,"I have had the camera for 11 months now. I like how easy it is to download pictures. It takes great pictures during the day BUT ... in a dark situation, when I have to use the flash the camera almost always focuses incorrectly. Even though it shows you with a red line where it is focusing, with the flash it does a poor job of really focusing where it says it is focusing. Plus, you think the picture is in focus because on the LCD screen it looks like it is in focus, but once you print the picture it is not in focus. Like I said, I have not had any focus problems when I am not using the flash. I'm not sure how to fix this problem."
5,Pureology,Love this product. I use it on my daughters hair and she does not use color. It makes her hair shiney and beautiful. It does the same for my colored hair.
1,Overrated,"I was very disappointed in this product. Considering the price, it offered nothing special over a typical over the counter gel product at any pharmacy."
5,Love These Targets!,"These targets are a must have for sighting in a new scope or iron sights. Depending on caliber you are not going to see the hits with the Mark 1 Eyeball at 100 yards. Get a decent spotting scope or learn to use your rifle scope to see your hits. Because I have a great spotting scope, I will not sight in a new scope with anything else."
1,false advertising,"The unit does NOT play MP3's as advertised/marketed. It plays DVD-movies and CD-Audio just fine, but not MP3's. I called the mfg'er and they verified that this model has never had the capability."
1,Most Boring Book Ever Published,"I expected an autobiography from someone who called races. I thought he would describe interesting experiences. I was SO wrong.He goes on and on and on about the most incredibly trivial things such as who he had dinner with and what wine they drank. If they had an interesting conversation, he doesn't describe it. He details bets he placed and the finishing order, which some people could make interesting, but not him. I got the impression he kept a scrapbook and included ever tedious detail, but either he's had a terrilby boring life or forgot most of the interesting things.On one page, I was surprised to find a mention of his wife. Falling in love and getting married isn't included in his autobiography. You'd think something like that would be more important than what wine he drank at a dinner some decades ago, wouldn't you?"
5,Life of the greatest commentator in history,This autobiography provides an insight into the life and times of the greatest horse-racing commentator the world has ever known.
3,Eveything Kids' Mazes Book,This was for my 5-year-old granddaughter who is a maze freak. She loved it.
1,DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY!!,"This is a warning to any buyer that might actually want to receive the items they purchase, because you WILL NOT if you buy ""directly"" from this company. If AMAZON has the item in stock then go for it, because I have NEVER had any problems with AMAZON not delivering my items in a timely fashion. I repeat, DO NOT BUY any book from this seller directly, because you will not receive the product. AMAZON was decent enough to give me a return on my money because the seller never provided the item I bought as a gift for my nephew. Kudos to AMAZON but, thumbs way down to the direct seller."
3,Book for young children.,"The best part about this book is the extensive history that accompanies each maze, giving the child another view of the world. It does require and adult to read to the child as the mazes are quite simple and created for young children."
5,"The Everything Kid's Mazes Book: Twist, Squirm, and Wind your way","A great book of mazes, for the older child or adult. Great pictures and looks like lots of fun. I bought is for my young granddaughter, but I think she will have to grow into it."
3,A bit advanced for little kids,"My son LOVES mazes and is very good at them. This box has a mix of difficulty levels, but several of them are quite hard. Those, of course, are the ones my 6-year-old wanted to do first. I would recommend this book to older children (at least finished first grade). I wish the publisher would have put age recommendations. I managed to put the book up and will get it out again next year. More color would have helped make the book agreeable for more ages as well, not only making it more attractive, but making following the maze passages easier."
3,Good Variation but lacking in originality,"I'll admit, some of the sorts of mazes in this book could not be found on the web *for free* but a lot of them could be. There was no real theme based around the mazes so I do know of children that became disinterested in this book pretty quickly. Better look at it in a bookstore just to see the inside before you buy it. Not the best but not the worst.SC-RG"
4,An enlightened look at post-WWII American culture,"This is a wonderful book which stayed with me for days after reading it. The author essentially boils down the cultural differences between pre and post 1960s America to the rise of personal freedom along with its inherent companion, the demise of societal authority. He does so with a mixture of anecdote and fact, ignoring the mainstream stereotypical view of that era, making for an easy and engaging read.Whether you view that time through the prism of the establishment, the dispossessed, or the child of either, you will find plenty here to mull as we approach the next phase of our evolving American culture. A fun, interesting read."
3,no title,"For a book I started out relishing in, by the end I was most thoroughly disallusioned and thought Ehrenhalt had, perversely, disproved most of his own conclusions. And he leaves out so much. His sense of 1957 seems to come from advertising, which is an always distorted picture of real life. He never mentions the emergence of Elvis Presley or Hugh Heffner as the earthquakes to our culture and mores that they were. Life seems a lot like it was in ""Babbitt"", and at the end, the author does compare 1957 to the 20s. But an early statement is devastatingly accurate: ""The difference between the 1950s and the 1990s is to a large extent the difference between a society in which market forces challenged traditional values and a society in which they have triumphed over them."""
1,The Way We Never Were,Misty water colored memories for an America that never existed by an entirely forgettable writer.
3,Revised product is too salty!,"The benefit of these tomatoes is they are sulfates and preservative free - or at least so says the label. The first two boxes of this product were a bit dry but still had much flavor. They had no discernible salt added. My most recent order was imported from Turkey and had the same overbearing, smoked flavor that cheaper sundried tomatoes on the market carry - a sign of preservation. I'm wondering if Melissa's had to find a new source of their product and as a result of the long journey, had to begin smoking/salting their product?"
3,Good bag but........,"I ordered two of these for my Eon 515's.The GOOD: Nice bag with lots of extra pockets, wheels, and pull out handle to roll the bag with. Seem to be high quality.The BAD: With the Eon 515s in the bag they won't stand up even for a couple seconds if you stop pulling them and try to stand them on the end with the wheels they will fall over. They add 10+ pounds to the weight of the speaker. The wheels seem too small, more like 1"" short horizontal rods. Wheel are fine for hard floors but not great for rough or carpet and horrible for area rugs as the catch the edges."
3,Still good....Just not as Great,"I loved the first two seasons! and I still like this season but it is missing one thing, the football. I like the first two seasons because they would talk about football and trash talk each other, they would refere to things that people playing fantasy football could sypathize with them on. But they have pretty much taken that all out, every now and then they will refer to setting a line-up or something but that is about it. Although still fun to watch they took the defining aspect of the show out."
5,Still hasnt lost its edge,"Season 3 is another good season for The League. Bluray is great as always. Little pricey still at $30. If you see it $25 and under, grab it while you can."
5,Soon to be a classic,This is my favorite season so far. People will be quoting lines from this series for generations. Awesome DVD will cool extra features.
5,Great Adult Series........,"From the writing to the acting to the props (The Sheva), this is one hilarious adult sitcom. It is Great."
5,League- best show on TV,"First couple episodes of season 3 have been great, they picked up right where they left off of season 2"
5,Under the Covers award winner,"Writing Romance was awarded the 1998 ""Under the Covers"" award for best writing book."
2,but Vanessa Grant can't write!,"This book was entertaining, but pretty useless. Most of the ""advice"" consists of personal accounts of Ms. Grant's own writing experiences, with very specific details as to how she came up with all her plots (and very minor attempts to translate this into beneficial knowledge for the reader). It could serve as a decent catalog if you were shopping for her books. She manages to make some useful points about designing characters to produce conflict, but she misuses vocabulary words on more than one occasion, lacks focus and flow, and really doesn't include any other valuable content. I finally had to quit reading when she started explaining how to use the ""omnipotent"" viewpoint (which is presumably one where the narrator can do anything?). ""How To Write Romances"" by Phyllis Taylor Pianka is the way to go for books of this sort, despite it not having quite as cheezy a cover as this one."
4,A good solid read.,"I had ordered the book with some misgivings. When it arrived, I expected to work through it laboriously chapter by chapter. To my surprise and delight it was a very enjoyable, easy read.I found the information helpful and instructive. I really like the fact that Ms. Grant gave descriptions of how she came up with some of her characters and scenarios. It was also interesting to read how some of her characters and plots progressed, changed, then took further twists and turns!Most valuable for me, however, was the validation that I am not going about this all the wrong way! It is nice to hear from someone who has done it, how they did it. You may not do the same, but it gives you a point of reference--that alone makes it worth the money."
3,So-So,"This book is fine if you want to read about writing romance for inspiration, but it does not provide much useful content. The author frequently refers to passages from her own books as examples of how to do something, but she doesn't give much of analysis or practical detail on how to write."
2,Lacking for a better word,There was only one piece of advice that worked for me in this book. With that it was helpful but the rest feltIke a waste...
5,Great for sensitive stomachs,"If your chi has a problem with spitting up food, try Royal Canin. My dog regularly spit up everything until I tried her on this brand. Its no longer a problem and I've noticed her coat (she's a long-hair) is shinier and just looks healthier."
3,Should be a good product,"This is almost a good product for the money, but you need to keep two disadvantages in mind:1. You must find some way to secure the top shelf to the supports - otherwise it will pop off. I drilled some holes near the back and attached the shelf with zip ties, and I have to think that is the best 5-minute fix. Once you do this, the product is solid.2. For some reason, they made the support too fat to fit them side-by-side on the same vertical ShelfTrack, so if you want two of these side-by-side, you need four ShelfTracks instead of just three.Other than that, they work just fine. I have some other problems with the whole ShelfTrack system, but those don't really belong in this review."
5,"I don't like to type ""lol"", but...","So, people type ""LOL"" all the time, and it usually doesn't mean anything.Listening to this album today at the office caused me to literally laugh out loud. As in, spontaneous outburst of audible laughter. As in, people near my office probably thought I was crazy.That is all."
5,very funny,This cd is narrated by weird al yankovic and is very funny.The classical music is very good.You have to add this album to your collection.
4,Replacement bar and chain,Bought this as a replacement of a old Homelite chainsaw that's hard to find parts for. It's a direct fit and works as stated. It was also the best price I could find for this combo set.
2,Too much material,"After reading the reviews for this book I thought for sure it would be a huge help. But... it wasn't. There's around 20 sections and although that might not seem that bad, for someone who is going high school five days a week and has hours of homework every night it is. Also, the information and examples presented at the beginning of each section are not sufficient enough. The book will give a simple example to explain a concept and then when you work on the practice questions they will be much harder. Too often I find myself scratching my head and turning to the answer page for an explanation and so instead of actually working through the problems myself and getting better at the process that goes with it I am actually just trying to remember how the book did it. If you are planning to get a high score and want an all around great book for the SAT I would suggest Baron's 2400 Aiming for the perfect score. It's a much more doable book and the math section is extremely helpful."
4,The Best of The Best,"This book is a collection of short stories that was put together by the great Harlem Renaissance writer, Langston Hughes. Some authors whose works are also featured in the book are Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, and Alice Walker. These stories are fun to read and they speak about the current issues that Black America was facing during the time period. This book is for anyone who is trying to better understand black thought during the 20th century."
2,Not for the beginner,"I was looking for a book that was simple, easy, and to the point. This book has WAY too much information; which is often hard to comprehend. Also, the pictures are really out-dated. This book was not helpful for me to learn about sensual massage."
1,Not what we were expecting,"The cover looked very interesting and tasteful. We were very disappointed that the whole book was in black n white and the photos were old, as it seemed to have been taken back in the 60's. My wife and I couldn't get into the reading as the graphics were not very appealing. We concluded that it was a waste of our money. We ended up much happier with Erotic Massage by Charla Hathaway."
3,"Great, but doesent last long","These filter packets seem ok.They are a great filter system, and filter out almost anything,But at the same time, after being in for about 2 months, they start to sag dramaticly, almost to a manner, wherethey would leach fibres into the tank.. and when they sag, they also sag, to where there will be like a hole in themiddle, to where they dont filter barely at all!If you are like me, and change the packets only every 2-3 months, then i wouldent even buy these types of packets.They are still good filter media though!"
1,Most vile food ever,"I bought this for lunches at college this term, without having tried it before. I pretty much only eat microwaveable food these days, so I am used to sacrificing a little flavor or texture for convenience.The ingredient list on this stuff must be intentionally missing something because it has the strongest chemical odor and taste imaginable. Imagine eating rice with WD40 or antifreeze. It is really that bad. Now I am stuck with 23 boxes that I am never going to eat. Even if you have no taste buds at all, don't buy this. It has to be unhealthy to eat something with this many unlisted chemicals."
5,Opera Gloves,I was amazed to receive my gloves so soon after ordering them. Thank you for your prompt service. The colour matches perfectly and they will make a wonderful addition to my wedding day. I certainly know where to come next time.
4,Great book,"all you need and more to learn about quality control. its amazing book, well written and takes you by hand and introduce to real life examples"
5,It Will Bring Out the Curmudgeon In You,"Worship is meant to be meaning-full. Every word, pause, and action is (or should be) intentional and holy. Dawn invites the reader into (an admittedly one-sided conversation) that reminds the reader of the sacredness of a gathered community of faith; and persuasively argues for the preservation of the rich tradition of Christian worship.Passionate proponents of ""contemporary"" worship will at the very least find points of disagreement. In fact, they may very well be offended. Nevertheless, this excellent book is a much needed and well-researched counter to the current trend towards assuming that traditional worship has no connection or meaning to contemporary culture.I highly recommend this book to anyone planning, contemplating, or participating in Christian worship in any form or denominational tradition. Warning: It may very well change things you have believed for a long time."
4,Making a point,"This book was written in response to the so-called ""worship wars"" in the last decades of the 20th century. However the insights of Dr. Dawn continue to be both useful and applicable for church music in the 21st century. Recommended."
3,"Good food for thought, too much repetition","While repetition certainly gets the point across about the main purposes of worship, it makes reading this book a challenge. I agree with the author on many points, especially the beauty and depth of hymns, but some of her ideas seem meant to exclude. Yes, God should be the focus of our prayers, offerings, songs, etc. Also, the author writes many times about the danger of tradition becoming stale. However, most of her conclusions point to what already is and there are very few ideas leading to a fresh approach to the next generation. Upon finishing the book, I felt glad for a sure focus for my worship life and for the depth in the Book of Common Prayer, but also felt despair at the lack of meaningful ways to involve those unaccustomed to juggling prayer books and hymnals."
3,Good Value for Price,Not bad for $90. The Left mounting bracket should have a screw attachement to the unit like the right bracket does (hardwired version). It was a little loose on that side even though the bracket was secure to the wall with toggle bolts. This improved slightly by caulking around the base of each side.
3,Good Economical Towel Warmer,"I've had this towel warmer now for two years and it's still working well and the finish has held up fine. It cuts down the time needed for a towel to drive to 1/6th of the time required without one.Mounting it was a little difficult as several of the other reviews have noted. If you aren't very handy you may wish to find someone to install it for you.The towels don't get really toasty, but they are a bit warm which is still nice after a shower in winter. Quick drying also prevents towels from smelling after a day or two, and definitely cuts down on laundry loads."
3,Towel Warmer,"Good Size. Because of the shape and stye, it does not dry towels completely. I also have the stand up model and it works better."
4,just as expected,"Product arrived just as expected. Looks like the picture. Lid suctions on during microwaving if not cracked, but that is to be expected.I am satisfied with this purchase."
3,Price isn't right !,"I bought this '' EXACT '' product at the dollar tree for $ 1.00 , the total was $ 1.07 ~~~ You can buy them all day long for a dollar bill !"
5,Love 'em1,"Just like in the restaurants. Tortillas stay warm throughout dinner. I bought two and I am glad I did as my tortillas come out a little thick from the tortilla press. Never counted how many they hold, but if you roll the tortillas out thin you should be fine (dependant upon the size of your family or party)."
4,tortillia keeper a keeper,i ordered the tortillia keeper for my husband and it arrived earlier than stated and works just great keeping his homemade tortillias warma dn cozie while we are enjoying dinner.
3,Seems well built but...,"This tortilla keeper seems well enough built, but there's no marking on it about what kind of plastic it's made of (usually plastic items have symbols showing the type of plastic for recycling purposes). This concerns me a little, considering it's coming into contact with food..."
4,"Action, Nothing But Action","It is hard to remember that action TV show can be 30 minutes. The sitcom seems to dominated the form today, but the Rat Patrol reminds me that you can have a complete action-oriented story delivered in a nice bit size chunk. I remember this show from my childhood and picked it up on a lark. I am not disappointed. The producers failed to include any extra (nothing, not even promo clips are included--clear indication who ever green lighted the DVD release was hoping to trigger impulse buying), but they clean up the episodes and it look beautiful. If you like action shows, The Rat Patrol is worth buying."
3,Rat patrol,"Unlike, most first season collections.This collection did not have the pilot movie. This caused the collection to lose part of it's appeal. Other wise it was very good"
1,Rat Patrol - The Complete First Season,I loved this as a kid... And so looked forward to it... but It was beyond terrible and dissapointing... I could not even get past the first disc... I guess life was different when we were young and only had 3 chanels (4 on a clear day)... spend your $ on hoagans hero's at least it is meant to be funny...
4,GREAT 60'S TV,"Great quality reproduction. Very entertaining and clean tv.The Americans/Allies are clearly the good guys!The military vehicles,weapons and equipment are not always accurate but only a history buff would notice.I plan to buy season two."
5,Youth revisited!,"Here in all their splendor you will find our heroes of the Rat Patrol. The entire first season is on this DVD. It was a wonderful trip down memory lane to once again ride along as those jeeps pounce on the dreaded huns with .50 calibre brownings spewing fire and brimstone.OK enough platitudes. I would have liked to find some behind the scenes trivia at the end of the DVD. Surely there must be some out-takes that they could have included. Oh well, maybe they will add that when they get around to releasing the second year's episodes."
5,At last.,"At last I found this TV series, I found combat and other war series, very good quality in image and sound. I really enjoy it."
4,Well worth the Wait,"I remembered watching some episodes of this show as a kid but NEVER saw it on any of the 500 cable channels we routinely get these days. When I got a chance to buy it I grabbed it.While you have to suspend disbelief (and any detailed knowledge of the North African campaign) this is a fun program. The thing is, I picked this up after coming back from Iraq. It kind of gives me the creeps that these guys run around in the desert all day setting up bombs and ambushing supply convoys..."
3,"Fun to watch, but...","I was very excited to see the series, and enjoyed the season (yes, I've watched it all). It's a don't miss for any fan.But why just 3 stars? For those not familiar to the series, it will probably not be as fun (and a bit repeatative), and the numerous 2 jeeps defeat tank/armoured vehicle column scenes are a bit unbelievable. If you're not enjoying the first few episodes, hang in there, they get better as the season goes on. So it's a solid 3 stars for any WWII fan (but at least 4 from a childhood fan). Keep in mine, it's good, but it's not ""Combat!"""
4,Your loved ones serving in Iraq & Afghanistan would enjoy this series.,"Who would have thought that a 40-year-old series like ""Rat Patrol"" could be so timely? Once again we have American and British troops fighting in the desert lands of Arab nations. Military personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan should easily identify with the Rat Patrol (three Americans and a Brit) and their desert locale with images of camels and Arab townspeople, some of whom are friendly and some who are not. All that's left to do is to imagine the Nazis as insurgents."
5,New research shows 1000 IU is Not too much,"Women can benifit by taking higher than traditionally recommended 400IU, greatly benifiting absorbing of calcium. Newist studies show that 1000UI a day is not toxic. It pays to keep up with current research and not rely on out of date information. Ask your doc and check medical research."
3,Not Sassy Enough For Me,I have to say I have a number of Lee Konitz cd's and this one was a disappointment. Not enough of that sassy sax quality which Mr Konitz is so good at. This should appeal to those Miles Davis fans of the world or the big band addict.
3,"Product great, packaging could use some work","The hair pins were exactly like described, however the packaging left much to be desired. It was shipped in an envelope that was crushed and therefore the plastic container was crushed and the pins were scattered around the envelope."
5,My son's favorite book,"We first found this book at a library. Now we have to read it all the time, and at least 3 times in a row. I don't know exactly what it is about the book, but my son loves it."
4,Football is Educational.,"Using various NFL players in a variety of action and non-action poses, this book introduces young children to opposites. Big & small; narrow & wide; over & under; off & on; and various other opposites are shown. Adults may enjoy this book more, trying to identify the different football stars (some who have left the game) who are pictured in the book (some include Terrell Davis, Will Shields, and Randall Cunningham). However, youngsters who enjoy football will probably learn a thing or two from this book, too."
5,dynojet carb kit,i was extremely skeptical when buying this kit because of the minor drilling that you have to do but i decided to buy it anyways. the kit is the exact one from dynojet and is extremely easy to put on. i highly recommend this kit for anyone with any bike. it does add a bit more top end speed on my bike and allows me to make sure the bike is running the way that i want it.
2,Pitch problems and vocal disappointments,"I really liked Gheorghiu the first time that I heard her. I thought that she was probably the best soprano out there in the spotlight. After hearing this CD, however, I have really changed my mind. First of all, she sings flat in alot in this CD. Secondly, her technique is showing some flaws now in that she can not always pronounce the words correctly. So she makes some strange sounds. For example, ""Tu, tu, tu"" which should be pronounced with a pure 'oo' sound is pronounced 'tuh'. I also feel that her voice is a bit frantic in alot of parts with her middle range and chest voice being weak and uncoordinated. How unfortunate! She needs to get it together or she is going down the toilet."
2,Not worth buying,"This is a depressing release, charaterised by insecure intonation and delivery, which inhibits the artist's interpretative range. The plodding conducting does not help matters. For some time, I have wondered whether Angela Gheorghiu was going to meet her earlier promise."
5,Great Cage...,"I highly recommend this cage for anyone that has small to medium sized bird(s). It's a HUGE cage -(if you have a parakeet, he/she is going to have SO much room -will be a very happy bird for sure), has a very nice look to it, and is quality constructed. Didn't come with any instructions, but frankly it's so easy to put together instructions are basically not needed. I love the dark colored bars this cage has, makes it so much easier to see your bird and looks way more expensive than the price. All in all just a great cage."
2,Pay extra for the good stuff.,"I painted the floor of my 4x4 with this stuff and while it did stick it takes many coats to get the desired thickness, got sticky way too fast (the roller would get stuck and then I'd mess up the coat trying to get it loose) and it had no texture to it. I'm planning on painting over with herculiner so I'll post if that stuff works any better."
1,BROKE AFTER FOUR WEEKS,"After 4 weeks the picture looked like an hourglass,the repair shop had it for one month while waiting for a part from Panasonic. TV was brought back to me yesterday, so far so good. Panasonic people were of no help, they have a ""we don't care"" attitude. I really doubt this set will last very long, unless you are wealthy don't buy this set!!"
1,A Very Poor Television,"A word of warning to anyone considering buying this or other Panasonic TVs: quality is very suspect.Only 3 months after purchasing this model, it was in the shop. The picture slipped, leaving the bottom part of the screen unviewable; the cabinet warped; and the on/off function failed to work (the only way to shut off the TV was to pull the plug).Panasonic was extremely slow to deal with the problem; it took over a month in the shop, and paying labor charges, to get the new product fixed. Even calling their service line you can expect to wait upwards of 20 minutes.Avoid this and other Panasonic televisions."
2,Audio Problem - You will get some Noisy Audio often,"Hi Folks,Well this is the perfect TV with the Brand name called Panasonic. I was thinking that i need to buy some new flat screen TV and ofcourse with good audio system in it. After all i bought this model. Well here is the problem i am facing right now...ofcourse i am getting this noice audio sound often. Once i called the Panasonic people, they said you can go thorugh the operating Instruction Book. This is for identifying the problem what i am facing. Yeah Folks you can see some problem they listed in their Manual Itself. According to their category of the probelm you have to talk to them. SO what i feel is dont go with this model. When there is a Television the one and only brand name called ----SONY----. So sony only introduced this flat model screen on early 90's. So i returned my TV and i bought the new Sony KV27FS13."
2,it`s not accurate,our history and culture is not taught to usit`s always some of the other class that writes their ownslant
4,Slavin's Macroeconomics for Democrats,The book is interesting but I feel it is somewhat tainted with Democratic Party ideals. This book is required for my college so I was forced to read and learn from it. The economic issues seem to bash the Republican Party and others which do not share the views of the Democratic Party. i would not recommend the book unless it is a reading requirement for college.
1,Why is he so big??,"At best a mediocre jazz trumpeter-he should stick to classical music. One would be far better off purchasing music from any great classic trumpet player such as Clifford Brown, Dizzy, Louis, Miles, Fats Navarro, Hot Lips Page, Buck Clayton,- or any other superior player. Just because he plays a Monette and worships Louis doesn't mean he can play jazz."
4,Nice mid-range I-Pod headphones,"Very comfortable, good selection of ear buds. Look pretty cool with the red anodized aluminum look, much better than than the white I-Pod buds.Sound good, does not block out all outside noise like some more expensive earbuds, which is a good thing most times not to be completely shut out of the outside world.Good value for the money.Would buy again!."
1,Not Happy,These ear buds have inconsistent volume side to side. The right side failed completely after only 30 hours of use in less than 1 month. Waiting for the manufacturer to honor the warranty.
2,Nice price but issues,"Nice price on the headphones but unfortunately the cords make noise when bumped. I use them for when I am exercising. The cord is fine up to the point where it splits in two. If the split cord bumps your clothes, face, etc. you can hear the ""thump"" in your ear buds. It can be resolved a little (but not completely) by clipping the cord to your shirt; however there is not clip provided so you'll have to improvise. I do like the sound and the size of buds provided fit great. I would not recommend buying these if you will be moving a lot while wearing them."
2,Too Fragile for Common Use,"While the sound on these was decent, the durability was poor. Within a short time of normal use, the wires came loose from the earpiece. The set was ruined. I had to throw them away. I will not purchase V-MODA products again."
2,Wish They Sounded as Slick as They Look,"In the spirit of keeping it short and sweet: These headphones look really slick and hip, right? Well, they do have THAT going for them. But the bass in them so overpowers everything else that it just ruins the listening experience. There are no highs and lows, vocals get lost, guitars get lost, everything is just clouded over by way too much bass.Also, after about 30 minutes the inside of my ears began to ache as there's only a thin piece of rubber protecting you from a little round nugget of hard metal.'Nuff said."
3,Sometimes Less Is More and More Is Less,"I bought these new as a returned item for $20 and they are of a high quality. As a $70 model, they are the most expensive earbuds I've ever owned. Their superior quality is evident through my radio jack, but on my iPod their high quality may be to the sound's detriment as they seem to highlight the compressed bit rate of the iPod music. The sound is dull, harsh, flat, very unpleasant. Ironically, this could be the high quality of the Red Rexx actually highlights the compressed iPod sound. All I can say is that in my experience the Red Roxx are ill matched with the iPod though a good match for my radio. For every day iPod use, I prefer my $14 JBuds 2."
2,Great while they lasted..,"Well, they sounded great while they lasted.. Which was less than two months. Left earbud stopped working after about 20 hours of use. Too bad too, thought they were comfy and sounded decent. Don't think I can justify buying another pair after reading all of the other comments with the same problem. There is an obvious defect with this product."
3,"Great, but After a few months....","You don't need me to point out the positives, you've read all the great reviews. They sound amazing, look amazing, and well worth the price if you're sort of considering $$$ in ear monitors. The problem I have, and I am very much not alone in this, is that eventually one or both sides of the earbud will fail. And this isn't counting in years, I'm counting in months and weeks.My first pair failed within the first month, the right side gave out very little sound. My second pair gave me three glorious MP3-filled months, then the right side failed again.V-moda being a new company, it's not entirely surprising they QC isn't up to snuff. I've heard of more expensive pairs of Shure that fail within less then that time frame, so maybe I'm just unlucky to catch two in a row.If my third pair replacement comes around and it fails again, I'm not even gonna bother with the warranty. I'm gonna jump ship and move up a an Shure IEM. Until then, please make up your own mind."
5,incredible bass,"I didn't know ear buds could even produce deep bass, but these little buggers definitely deliver. I have not really detected any kind of ""break-in"" change in the sound, the biggest change in the sound actually occurred when I switched to the medium size silicon tips. Be sure you get a good seal on your ears, because the bass response seems to increase dramatically. Also, I believe V-moda has somewhat revised their design, because the stereo jack on my set seems a little more reinforced at the sleeve that those pictured. I would guess this is in response to issues with the sleeve separating."
1,Dead after 8 months,"I bought these in March as a gift for my wife. It is now November and the right channel is dead. I paid $108 including tax for these at the Apple store so they are sold ""as is"" which means i am SOL.For $100 i'd expect headphones to last longer than 8 months. I will not be buying another pair of these crappy earphones."
3,"Good fit and noise reduction, bass dominates too much","These earphones fit in the ear very well, they did not slip out during a full workout and they are comfortable. They are nice in appearance and well made overall. Noise reduction was a real plus - I could not hear the other exercise machines in the fitness center, and less volume is required from the MP3 player or IPOD to be heard. Bass response is strong - indeed you will hear the bass line clearly and notice the bass line much more. However, I thought it lacked high end, and found myself wanting to turn up the treble response. For classic rock, the low end dominated the guitar and vocals too much for my taste. As a musician I am very picky about sound quality, and despite the excellent fit, quality, and noise reduction, I vastly preferred the standard IPOD headphones for sound quality, and high end sparkle. I wound up giving these to a family member who is not as picky about sound quality as I am."
3,"WAAAY too big for two people. Pretty, but has serious issues...","We were borrowing my in-laws 40 year old fondue pot before we received this. I definitely prefer that one (Waring) to this one.Good1) Heats very quickly.2) Very large capacity which is good if you have 4+ adults3) Looks niceBad1) Rubber feet are VERY fragile. One came off and the exposed screw scratched the table2) Heats unevenly3) Too big if it's just the two of you. Also with such a large capacity it takes 2 packages of cheese to get enough fondue to dip - but that's far more than 2 people would normally eat.4) This thing is designed to boil several pints of oil for oil Fondue so it's way too powerful for cheese. As a result it cycles on and off, intermittently overheating and then cooling off.5) Cord is way too short. It says you're NOT supposed to use an extension, but who has an outlet within 16"" inches of their dinner table?If you've found this review helpful, or have questions/comments, please let me know!"
1,WARNING CD-R !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I recently purchased this item from ArkivMusic. The item was listed as new. To my surprise and disappointment I received the item and it was actually CD-R's. This was not disclosed by the seller or stated in the Amazon listing. I believe the seller is ultimately responsible for stating this but I know that Amazon does provide this information for some of the CD-R music on demand products it list, but not this one. My initial contact with ArkivMusic has ended badly with the same music statement I've received before from other sellers pulling this switch but that not the point, which they're well aware of and I'm sure it will end badly. I thought the folks looking at this product should at least know that they could be receiving something other than they thought. A CD-R is not equivalent to a standard manufactured CD - I'm a 100% sure of that. Put it in your car over the summer and see if it plays at the end, I doubt it. Buyers beware of ArkivMusic."
5,awesome shoe,this shoe is a really good pair of running shoes!!!!sometimes they can hurt your achilles tendons if you jump but most of the time you're jumping it's fine. my favorite color is blue and the shoe tendsto have blue in it.buy the shoe!!!!!!
3,"Works fine, But it's big.","Item works as described, It's just big as transformers go. It does the job it's required to do well. Sure beats replacing batterries all the time..."
3,It is edible.,"Not the worst I have tasted, but certainty not as good as Spaa brand. I think the taste is more like Indian (India) curry and less of the Thai taste. Still, it is much better than some I have bought here (watch out for the brand with baby corn in it, I have thrown out the whole order after eating just one package because it was so bad, and I am very frugal).With this, I thought I would save money with the sale. It is edible, but will not buy again."
2,Diamonds in the Mud,"This video leaves much to be desired. It has too much inane narration and not enough music. Rather than presenting the entire concert only excerpts from a few songs are included. Interviews with the performers are often insightful but also laughable. Cheesy psychedelic visual effects were added that obscure the performance so don't expect to be able to carefully observe the band in action. Although this video is mostly disappointing, some great music and great playing does occasionally shine through the mud. Lower your expectations and you'll probably find it entertaining."
3,Decent movie,It brought back memories of shady investors in the early days of Indian gaming in California and how they can destroy the unity of a tribe.I like all of Gary Farmer's movies so that was a plus.
2,Casino Indians of California,"I am disappointed in ""California Indian"". A great crew of Native Actors (Gil Birmingham, Julia Jones, Gary Farmer, Mark Boone Jr and even Dennis Banks), reinforce non-natives view points that all California Indians have casinos and that our tribal councils are medicore at best.My hope for the video was to tell the story of California Indians 1848 to present. Since we are left out of all the other Historical videos concerning Native/United States relations this could have been a real view of History to teach NON-Natives why there are Tribes/reservations/rancheria's.... and that we all do NOT have casinos."
3,Great art with weak story!,"I am a huge Greg Rucka fan and have always liked his portrayal of Diana. Here, I thought the story of a young woman who comes to Wonder Woman for aid is a little lacking. Maybe if this was part of her monthly series and could be fleshed out many times over it would have meant more. Here, you're not left with much and care about those involved very lightly. The art however, is beautiful. I J.G. Jones could do a monthly book, no matter what book, I would buy it. Fantastic stuff. Overall, pretty to look at but not doing much."
2,Where's the beef?,"The good:The art is great.Wonder woman is no weakling.Has a little bit of Mythos.Good story concept.Writing (whats there)is great.The bad:It takes about 25 minutes to finish.Hardly any fighting or combat of any kind.Motivating ideas are not fleshed out. Everything is just vague.90 pages long and about 20% have no dialog, narrative, or any writing what so ever.The rest of the pages average about 15-20 words per page.(Not word bubbles but words.)This is the first wonder woman book I have read and am praying that this is not the norm, but judging from the possitive ratings I guess I'm in for disappointment. Is this really that hard of a character to write a quality story for?"
5,one of the 10 for that desert island,"i love this CD!!! i spent years searching out the two LPs once i heard them. every tune she sang became hers. down in the depths, you are not my first love, lazy afernoon...all of them. you hear her sing and from that moment on you can only hear HER version. others dont compare. she was that good. really. listen to her.Larry Brill"
4,Love hate relationship,I have had my unit for a few years let's say 3 years in the beginning I loved this machine couldn't say enough wonderful things about itnow I fear I am beginning to hate this machine cos it is always having a paper jam or something which holds me up from printing work and running out the door (i'm a very late minute person)so I find myself slamming the top open and closed and cussing trying to make it workI need a new more relaible machine and I am seriously thinking of buying another! crazy or whatThe good old days WERE VERY good!
4,Garcia was a guy like everyone else.,"If you are looking for a uplifting, Jerry was the greatest man ever kind of biography don't bother with this book. If on the other hand you are interested in a candid look at his life and the evolution of his music and groups then full steam ahead. I consider myself a fan of Jerry and the Dead and was glad to see him treated as an individual. One obvious omission was the lack of discussion from the other members of the Grateful Dead on Jerry's life in the book. That may have meant the difference between a good book and an exellent book."
5,The Garcia bio against which all others will be judged.,"Long-time Dead observer Blair Jackson has fashioned the most comprehensive biography yet written. Well researched, it sheds new and interesting light on Garcia's youth, and his pre-Dead folk and bluegrass periods. Perhaps the best aspect of the book (aside from Jackson's conversational style of writing) is the empahsis on the MUSIC Garcia and mates played. Many of the previous books about Garcia and the Dead have ignored the most obvious draw of the Dead over the years in favor of lurid personal details or accounts of the colorful (and often erroneoulsy stereotyped) Deadheads. While investigating and exploring all of Garcia's life, Jackson manages to balance the story and show the very creative side of his musical legacy. A must for every Deadhead's shelf, and of interest of any lover of music. The standard against which all future accounts of the ""long, strange trip"" will be judged."
3,Good book for the Gr.Dead fanatic,"This is a good book for the Dead Head or heavy-duty Garcia fan, but anyone else will find it to be a labored read. To be honest, I only made it about half way through the book. I purchased this book as I prefer true stories, and am a fan of the Dead, (although I have never considered myself a ""Dead Head""). The book started off well, detailing Garcia's early life. Then the author went off into excruciating detail of each song, each album, each show...until I was so bored that I put the book down and couldn't summon the desire to pick it up again. Although I didn't enjoy this book too much, I gave it to a friend of mine who is a Dead fanatic, and he is enjoying it. So, I guess you enjoyment of this book will depend on just how much of a fan you are of Jerry Garcia."
3,Another tired summation of the Grateful Dead experience,"This well written, but ultimately disappointing book, is less a biography of Jerry Garcia and more of a chronicle of the Dead's history with Jerry as its focus. There is not much new here that the veteran fan has not read or heard before. As an introductory primer, it is a success. But for those of us who have digested just about everything in the print media, it is a long read with a few eyebrow raising facts heretofore undocumented. For a more in depth look at Garcia, Robert Greenfield's fine oral history ""Dark Star"" is the choice. Somewhere between Rock Scully's sour grapes ""Living With The Dead"" the Jackson's work, lies a book that will admit the reader to the creative, charismatic, self destructive person that was Jerry Garcia. Perhaps, Dennis McNally's long rumoured tome on the band will fit in that space"
2,"Sorry, this one doesn't cut it","As an overview of the career of Garcia and the Dead this book pretty much gives it all, and that's about it. There is no real insight into the character of the man. What were his demons? What drove such a creative and clearly intelligent man to such self destruction? He was one of the most talented musicians of his generation, and his work was uniquely American in a way few if any others could match. The title implies that this will be explored in the book, but for the most part it is not. If you are familiar with the Dead, there is really nothing new here. Good as a reference book, but not for anything else.Blair is clearly unwilling to tell some uncomfortable truths (he claims the death of Brent Mydland was not a suicide, yet Jerry all but said it was in a 1991 Rolling Stone interview, and the circumstances certainly point that direction as well). I think the author is, in the end, too much of an insider to give a balanced and truly honest telling of this story."
4,The kind book,Finally a book that shows Garcia in all his human-ness. A must for anyone who wants to dig deep into the history of The Grateful Dead. The book is written in such a way as to present Garcia objectively without a lot of fluff about the mystical heights the music brought us. Kudos to Jackson for making Garcia a real person.
4,GREAT TOY!!,"If u are a fan of the virtua fighhter series you should DEFENATLEY get this. the toy comes with its own character card which i kept. a game review of virtua fighter 4 on the back and its awesome. now i have a sega collection! i have sonic stuff, super monkey ball stuff, and now akira yuki. i think those are the only sega franchises that have toys. even though akira looks better on the shelf he can be played with and he is not poseble that much, his only pose is the one in the pic. Still AWESOME and for the low price of 3.99!"
1,Dreadful,"This has got to be the worst recording of Faure's Requiem in existence. The tempo drags like a beached whale, the soloists can't find the pitch no matter how hard they try, and the timing of the orchestra has all the finesse of a two-year-old attempting to dance a tango. In short it's about as convincing as an Imus apology. Avoid this recording like the plague."
2,Avoid it,"I cannot believe Columbia (now Sony) ever went to Japan to record Faure. Had they used adequate soloists, it would have been okay. The chorus handles their part quite well, despite serious diction problems. But the soloists are a disaster and the conducting is not at all in the style of Faure. The recording has been around for a very long time. It should have been deleted years ago. In the meantime, do not buy it. There are too many good versions out there."
1,Bogus.,"This item is bogus. You can find all of it for free at www.dartmouthatlas.org, and it will be up to date."
5,To teach others to love G-d,Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan was one of the great outreach teachers of the twentieth century.In this work he is guided by a fundamental principle of outreach one he teaches by citing the Rambam. It is the great principle that the greatest love of G-d is to teach others the love ofG-d.Aryeh Kaplan who did this so much during his own lifetime continues to do this through his books and other writings and teachings to this very day.
5,A source of joy,"I have just started making flutes as a hobby, because I thought it would be interesting, and to knock out a few cheap Christmas presents for a myriad of nieces and nephews. I did not anticipate what a source of joy making flutes would be for its own sake. This book got me started and will remain the most senior of my teachers as long as I do this. What you do not find in its lines, you will find between them as you grow in the experience. I am sure there are many more advanced books out there, but they will be useless without the foundation that this book provides."
3,It's alright but more how to would be nice,"Personally, I liked the book, but perhaps some more pictures on how to do things would be nice. For example, on how to make a wood flute it says a shell auger can be used to make a flute. Some step by step directions would be nice."
2,Simple Book...,"Too simple....I almost returned it, but didn't think it was worth the effort.This is a PAMPHLET, not a book....there are pages with only one centered paragraph on the whole page, saying, basically, ""you too can play a flute."" Then on to the next chapter!It has some worthwhile information, so I kept it. The title is longer than the book....maybe he should have put the title inside to make it longer."
3,Pretty neat but definitely produced cheap!,"Whitney Design ML-6238 Bamboo Square-Shaped Box with Lid, Set of 2This is pretty sturdy but the lids don't fit very well. I would rate this item a 3/5."
4,Small - But Well-Made,"As everyone as mentioned - this is a very small shovel. The head is not much larger than my hand. However, I wanted to put one in each of my vehicles and on my snowmobile and ATV in case of an emergency, and they are perfect for that application. They fold up into a tiny case - but appear to be well constructed of decent metal."
3,good quality but SMALL,This is a small shovel. I missed that info in the product listing. Probably good for backpacking but I got it for use in my 4WD off-roading and it's really too small for that purpose.
2,"Coleman folding ""shovel""","The Coleman folding shovel is so small as to be impractical except for survival gardening. It is in fact, no larger than a garden trowel. Over all I'm not very happy with my purchase"
1,"The blade is only 4"" wide",This is a solid and sturdy little shovel.My problem is that it is so little. The blade is only 4 inches wide at the widest point and the whole unit when folded fits in one hand.Imagine making diagonal folds on an index card as if making a paper airplane that is what the blade is like.Other than that it is of typical Coleman quality
1,Junk,"Don't waist your money. Its junk. Find yourself a Military folding shovel, and I don't mean a ""Military type made in china"". It will serve you much better for much longer."
4,Smaller than expected,"It is much smaller than I expected, but it is of very good quality. I have actually found the the belt size package is quite useful. If you want a small camp/hiking shovel this is a great package. If you are looking for something to do a larger job, look elsewhere."
2,Horrible quality,"The reason I give this 2 stars is because it's good for a couple of uses, but the pieces wear down and the shovel just becomes a giant spoon after multiple uses. I bought a Gerber folding shovel for 20.00 plus shipping and it's held up great, I would suggest the Gerber as a long term camping tool."
4,"Small, Well Made Tool","What I'd like to find is something like the Army surplus entrenching tool I kept in my car many years ago, but this tool is a fairly satisfactory alternative. It's about half the size of the real thing so you can't go crazy with it, but considering its size (and the fact that it breaks down to a very handy size for storage) it is quite sturdy and well worth the price. I bought two, one for my car, one for my wife's."
3,"Sturdy, but TINY","Coleman's folding shovel is a sturdy, but TINY tool. The product description describes it as being 23"" long when unfolded. I measured it at 16"". The shovel head measures just3 5/8"" x 5"". It would be good for hiking or backpacking and the carrying pouch could be attached to a belt, but it is not the size I was expecting to ""out"" a campfire. I gave it 3 stars for it's sturdy construction."
3,Possible defect?,I liked the price on this combination pick/shovel. The size and weight are good and the quality appears to be there. One major issue is that when locked in the shovel position the shovel will still fold over because of rounded corners on the locking side. I wonder if I got a reject? This is not the case on the pick side? Very strange..
3,Flimsy but effective,This little shovel is perfect for digging your latrine but don't expect to move mountains with it. Also the spade is about the size of my hand so don't expect your latrine to be very big.
2,Bring the pain,"At first I thought this shovel was just really bendy and worthless. Then I REALLY got into it. Have you ever played ""smash the raccoon"" on a mid summer's eve? Not with this ths piece of junk. I cut my hand."
1,Failed After First Use,"I got this product new and was looking forward to using it. However, the first thing I did was dig a fire pit, and while using the tool I managed to round out the pick side. Not longer after I discovered the shovel head will no longer stay straight. I think digging a fire pit is pretty basic camp use. But maybe I'm rougher than most?"
2,Coleman toy shovel,The pictures are deceiving. The blade is about the same size as my hand. Could one use this thing to dig a hole? Sure. Just don't be in a hurry. And don't need a big one. I would sent this back except it doesn't take up a lot of space and will probably work in a pinch.Mechanically it is very nice. The serrated edge won't make it to the level of being a joke. It is nothing more than wiggles in the side of the blade. The blade has been somewhat 'sharpened'. But there really wasn't a lot of effort put into it. The grips are decent.The next time I will definitely take a close look at the overall dimensions.
3,More compact,"More compact and smaller than expected, almost sent item back, but figured I would have some use for the product. Paid for the ""Coleman"" brand name. A little pricey considering the construction and size of item."
2,Little but powerful,"It was little than it was described but works well, I use mine for Metal detecting, the scoop is about the right size for light action digging. Its light an compact!! On the down side Walmart had it for 10 dollars cheaper. I went ahead and bought a real entrenching tool for the same price as this one. Trust me you wouldn't want to dig a trench with it"
1,Thank God he has only written one book,"People like Jim LeCuyer should not be allowed to influence minds - young or old. His perverse sense of human sexuality and indeed, all forms of human interaction, present a danger to anyone who reads his work. He has damaged many a young aspiring writer with his unsavory and inappropriate commentary on the world."
3,Aesop's Fables,"The CD arrived in good condition and in a fairly timely manner. My girls (aged 3 through 6) seem to enjoy listening to the CD. Problem is that the stories seem to run into each other. And the whole CD last maybe half an hour. I was disappointed with the length... kind of expensive for just 30 minutes of stories. However, it is a good introduction to the Fables, and okay for story-time."
5,Met my expectations- no complaints.,Book was in good condition and delivered on time to meet my deadline. Content wise- it is a helpful read with sample documents that provide substantive guidance in drafting of industry agreements.Thanks.
1,La finta Giardniera,Disappointed. wrong viewing region. had to return dvd.It needs to be made clear on the buying info what region the dvd is.
3,Pleasant but not memorable,Well done opera on a small stage with period pieces; made me feel Mozart would come out after the show. If this were not by Mozart I guarantee you this opera would have been buried in obscurity. I bet there were thousands of operas like this in history never heard of again because the composer was not by this famous genius. By all means see it for $15 dollars. You will not remember any thing about it a week later because it is not a very memorable opera.
1,Mozart - La Finta Giardiniera,"I DID NOT LIKE THIS PRODUCTION AT ALL. THE COSTUMES & MAKE-UPS WERE HIDEOUS, THE SETS WERE NOT VERY GOOD EITHER. I'D LIKE TO WATCH A DIFFERENT PRODUCTION OF THIS OPERA, WITH DIFFERENT SINGERS. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DVD."
4,This will be HUGE,"This band is great, and even better live. They've really learned their lessons from Jawbox, Fugazi, and Drive Like Jehu. They have pop hooks but an abrasive exterior. Well written, extremely thought out and thought provoking material. check them out"
5,A 'you are there' feel to discussions of notable moments,"The music of folk singer Woody Guthrie's works lives on in Ed Cray's Ramblin' Man: a biography which charts his coming of age, his many associations with influential musicians of the times, and his shows and stage presentations. Unlike other biographies, Ramblin' Man takes a personal approach and presents a 'you are there' feel to discussions of notable moments in Guthrie's life, offers from booking agents, and stage appearances. Ramblin Man reads with all the passion and drama of the novel but is a solid factual review of Woody Guthrie's inherently fascinating life and times."
4,Good read,"I was quite familiar with much of Woody Guthrie's music prior to reading this book. The author did a great job of allowing us a window into the life of the songwriter. I was surprised that Woody was not more wealthy while he was active. Woody made so many cross-country trips that they start to run together, and it can be somewhat difficult to keep track of all of it. I would have enjoyed a little more insight into some of his most famous songs, but apparently Woody himself paid little attention to most of them.I recommend it."
2,Review of the Book ... not Woody or his life,"Two stars is generous ... I only wanted to give it one and a half. This book is TEDIOUS!! It is just plain difficult to read and the details are way, way too much. I never at any point felt like I wanted to turn the page or that I couldn't put the book down. Rather, I wanted to (and did) skim read the pages and throw the book down. Woody's music was great and his life facinating but unfortunately neither was conveyed in an interesting way via this book. My recommendation is to read Woody's biography ... Bound for Glory.My son hated Stienbeck's ""Travels with Charlie"" ... so I'm keeping this book in case he misbehaves ... I'll make him read it."
4,Heads Up For Buyers,"Since these books aren't labeled, I thought people might want to know that this book is a reprint of the Transformers Generation 2 Comic Books Issues 7-12."
1,More garbage from the writer who brought down Transformers,Yet another piece of garbage written by the same man who brought down the Transformers original comic run and later Dreamwave comic studio. Simon Furman have written crap since he first took over writing duties on the original Transformer comics. I never like his ways in how he write the myths in Transformers lore in every Transformers comics. Furman was always bad luck when it comes to every Transformers comics he wrote. The ending to the Generation 2 was a real downer which everyones wondered what will happened next if it continues. That's why I DON'T recommend reading the two volumes of Transformers Generation 2 because it's all nothing but crap written by the same man who was bad luck to every Transformers comics.
4,Great for the price,"The only thing I don't like about it, is the scanning area is upside down where most scanners you open the lid and put your photo or document close to you this scanner you have to put it all the way to the back of the scanner so you have to open the lid all the way. Also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use. I did like the way XP found this scanner right away with no disks or software. I have a cannon scanner I just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with XP with out cannons software, The cannon was so bad that I purchased this one all in all I like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers."
5,HP Scanjet 4370 Photo Scanner,"For my purposes, general scanning and copying photos, this seems to be just fine. So far, have had no problems."
2,Liked previously owned scanner better,I am very unhappy with my new scanner. My old scanner was very easy to use all I had to do was scan a picture and it showed up on the computer where I could then change the size and output and print it. I tried to get this new scanner to do the same. The reason I purchased a HP scanner is because the old one was a HP scanner and thoughtthe new one would be the same. I do not scan film or negatives - all I want is a good and easy to use scanner.
2,Scanjet 4370,"Painfully Slow!!!!! I purchased the scanner for general scanning, plus to scan a few slides. It takes almost two minutes to scan a slide. Then you have to play with the software to make the scan appear. If I can return this scanner, I will. Overall, I find HP products lack the technological edge of Canon, Epson, etc. The U.S. fails again, something I hate to say."
3,HpScanjet 4370 Photo Scanner,I think this is a very good product and enjoy using it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good quality scanner!
1,Barely works,I have to reinstall the software and restart my computer two out of every three times I try to use this hunk of junk. Avoid at all costs!!!
1,HP get the software all wrong,Looking good is about as far as HP can get with this product. The software has serious communication problems with the hardware. The communication patch that HP released did not solve the problem. After eventually getting the scanner to work the driver information for the scanner was overwritten by the HP Solution center and the Hardware and software could no longer talk again as the operating system now does not see the scanner anymore. This is the worst piece of hardware software compatibility I have encountered in a long time. I am going to get my money back and would not suggest anyone else buy this until HP gets their software sorted out.
2,There are better ways to spend an afternoon with Churchill,"I am thankful Churchill wrote only one novel. I'm not sorry I bought it and read some of it, but, I didn't finish it and don't feel the less for it. If you are writing a biography of him, you might find some philosophy in here that would make it worth your while, but he was an amateur when it came to this form. As someone who thinks that Churchill was the greatest man of the 20th century, and one of its greatest writers, I wish I could be more enthusiastic. However, pick up anything else by him, and you will be enthralled."
5,Love this green stuff,"Kyo-Chlorella - love this green stuff! Arrives when it should, is consistently of quality and works. Helps with all the functions of the body. Not near as much pain from fibro, not near as much plaque and tartar on the teeth and the allergies are much better."
5,Lots of fun,I had so much fun reading this book. I kept my husband up one night because I was giggling so much while I was reading in bed.
5,The BEST strip ever!!!,"Of course, nothing beats the old favorite Calvin and Hobbes, but this is REALLY close. Fox Trot is hilarious. I can guarantee you'll be laughing out loud after reading this book. If you've ever heard anything bad about these strips, you have been lied to. This particular book is my favorite. I've read them all and I promise you will want to also after reading this book!"
4,"great, but short","As always, I enjoyed the content of this Foxtrot collection. I am very disappointed though, that it is a third the size of past Foxtrot collections. It has almost the same number of pages, but fewer comic strips per page. They've shrunk it. Instead of the usual 3 strips per page, its been made smaller and has only 2 strips per page. All for the price that more got you. I guess it is really all about the mighty dollar. :("
4,Very nice,"This is the greatest anime every made. The DVD doesn't really offer any extras...or an English version...but it is an amazing world that everyone should experience. The special edition just includes an audio CD that is way below expectations, so just get the normal edition."
5,A splendid artbook,"The Railway Paintings Of Alan Fearnley is an impressively memorable artbook showcasing Alan Fearnley's captivating, full-color oil-on-canvas paintings of a wide variety of celebrated steam locomotives. Each individual painting (and they are truly gorgeous!) has its own full page of information devoted solely to it, as well as a brief commentary on the history of the locomotive being featured. A splendid artbook in its own right, The Railway Paintings Of Alan Fearnley is most especially recommended for train buffs and railroading enthusiasts."
2,not as good as it sounds,dosn't cover the information in a step by step manner. they just talk about the moves
2,Two Extra Links,"This 20"" saw chain had two more links than the factory installed chain. What's up with that? Now, when I change chains, I have to go through some manipulations that are a nuisance."
2,Not the right chain,"Please be careful when ordering chains on Amazon. I bought the 20"" Poulan and they recommended this chain for the saw but it clearly doesn't fit. It should be the D70 not D72 chain for the saw. I damaged my saw a little becasue I couldn't get the chain tight enough. Lesson learned however."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought a new cub cadet chain saw so I thought I would get an extra chain. Amazon was pushing this one. Well when it came the box was different than the one shown, but the number was the same. When I went to put it on the chain was an inch too long. So I went to the local hardware store and looked at the oregon box....CUB CADET IS NOT EVEN LISTED ON THE BOX. The picture they show is either old or photo shopped. As i took so long to need it i am stuck with it. Thanks Amazon!"
5,I goofed,"I ordered the wrong one, I needed a 70 link chain, but I gave it to a friend that has a saw that the 72 link link fits."
3,NOT FOR POULAN,"I am sure this is a good chain as I have used several in the past, however this will not fit a Poulan as advertised, I had to swap it out at a local store who was gracious enough to take it for a trade even though it was purchased here. Poulan uses an H-78 chain."
1,False Advertising on Box,"The box states that this will fit a Stihl MS290 chainsaw with a 20"" bar. It does not. It was way too short for my Farm Boss. Even with the bar set back as close to the clutch as possible, the chain was still a 1/2"" short. The OEM chain made by Stihl has the same pitch, # of links, etc., but is at least an inch longer than this chain."
1,bad with no explanation,worst book ever period has only stupid combinations that dont improve your chess
3,Education?,"Willy Russell wrote a play about a woman who tries to find herself by being educated.Her name is Rita. She reads a lot of books and with the help of her professor Frank she is also able to understand them. She becomes independent, she leaves her husband and changes her life completely. At the end she doesn't need her teacher any longer and they go separate ways. The tragic point of the play is that Rita can't really improve her life inspite of all education. She can't go back to her former life, but she hasn't a new one yet. Frank is going to Australia, after loosing his job, because he is an alcoholic.The play is interesting, but there are a lot of authors mentioned who make the whole text a bit difficult to read. It has been written in dialogues and threw the whole play there are only Rita and Frank talking to each other. We can recommend the book.(two students) Aarau, Switzerland"
4,Casca's Vietnam experiences in the French Foreign Legion,"Having noticed the unhelpful review below, I decided to write a proper one about the book. Casca is recruited into the French Foreign Legion in the aftermath of the second worldwar - the first part of the story deals with Casca's escape from a shattered Berlin and is wonderfully written - and trains in Africa.He is then shipped to Vietnam and is involved in the bitter war against the Viets fighting for independance. Gus Beidemann joins Casca and the two enjoy a few hilarious adventures before they are dropped into Dien Bien Phu in 1954 which saw the eclipse of France's Indochinese empire. The battle is well written and gives you some idea as to what went on in that terrible siege.For the world of Casca visit www.casca.net"
3,General introduction on i-mode,Interesting introduction on i-mode model that still is not really well known in Europe and USA. I suggest this to anyone interested on mobile consumer added value services.
1,Ringlight Useless!,"This item is advertised as an accessory for Canon Eos cameras. While it may be good for film cameras, it will not work with digital. Nowhere in the offering is/was this mentioned!Further, I have tried to return it, but I get no response from the vendor!This is unacceptable, and I don't know how to proceed."
1,below poor quality,"buyer beware -- does not give even illumination, fits poorly with my eos canon, and just is trouble --- stay away do not buy"
3,Full Power flash and compatible with ETTL-II Types only,"Before you buy this flash , you have to take care that all CANON with ETTL-I is not compatible (LIKE CANON 5D/20D/10D).This flash is only compatible with ETTL-II Types like 40D/50D/7D/5DII.This flash is Full Power flash and no control over the light power , you can only control it from the camera from f-stop number and the ISO speed and shuter speed ,also no High sync speed available , so the maximum Shutter you can take is 1/250 .If you accept all above then it's great one...!!"
5,A Mom After God's Own Heart,"I teach a Mom's Bible study and the moms and I love this book. As the word gets out about what we are doing the class keeps growing and growing. With the help of this book, we are learning that whether we are aware of not we are teaching our children with everything we do. If we want to raise children that love the Lord, we have to show our love for Him not just on Sunday but everyday. This book is helping us to grow spiritually by taking us deeper into God's Word and helping us to better understand the importance of our job as moms. I highly recommend it for small group study."
3,The good verses the bad... Who wins?,"The book is lovely to look at, but who goes around buying books JUST to look at the pictures? The borders are vibrant and catch your eye with their originality and style but what can you really do with them? The sides are extremely uneven leaving no real way to fix and ""pixel-push"" into a usable piece of artwork. There is no hope for this book when dealing with graphical design. You should save your money for something better."
5,Fits great!,"Fits perfect! Not small, or too big for our sink. It was very hard to find one this size. It fits most sinks that are not too small"
2,Not what I expected...,"I had been looking for a replacement dish drainer for several weeks and thought I had finally found the right product. This dish drainer is lightweight and also seems extremely fragile. It is also very small and even though the support bars span the basin there is so little overlap that I was afraid that it might slip into the basin when weighted with dishes, etc. I returned it and my search continues."
3,dish drainer,The drainer is nice but arrived with a broken utensil basket. Spoke with the company and they stated they would send one out immediately and I have never heard a thing!
4,clears up counter space,Before I had the dish dryer on my counter which was so cluttered!This fits perfectly into my sink and really clears up lots of counter space.
3,Good Stuff,did not come with the silverware holder so i was a bit disappointed by that but none the less a good item
2,Just ok...,"It's just ok... does the job but I wouldn't purchase this item again...Keep slipping off border of sink, doesn't hold a lot, and looks cheap..."
3,No plastic utensil holder included,"I have to use this style of dish drainer with my large kitchen sink. It works great for what we need. It didn't come with a plastic utensil holder like the picture showed. Amazon customer service was great and they deserve an A+. They worked it out with us. I wound up finding a utensil holder at Bed Bath and Beyond. Over time, the metal under the plastic protectors gets discolored and rusty (at least for us, ours does). We've bought a few of this style in the past from different places, and the rust happened with each one over time. We just replace them more frequently."
3,Over-the- Sink Dish Drainer,Everything is as advertised. Totally adjustable without touching the bottom of the sink. Only complaint is that the silverwear holder is too small.
5,great little kitchen addition,I am so happy with this product. It simply expands to fit the sinks perfectly. Nice and compact. Perfect for a small space and especially if it is just for one person. Cleans up nicely too.
3,adequate,this item is OK for washing the odd bits.. but the plastic cutlery basket is WAY too small and shallow and hard plastic which is likely to crack.. ep
5,Delicious and easy to follow recipes from the tv show,"A great book with great menus and just delicious. Easy to prepare and fun to eat. The show was a pleasure to watch, too!"
1,For the campus bookstore only,"This book is not very good as a general introduction to programming. This book wants to give you a tool which you can use to solve purely technical tasks. Further, it wants to give you a programming style before introducing any basic concepts about the programming language. Finally, SML is a bad choise if you are a complete newbie, as the SML lives in a very small world. There are 100s of books on other languages, but so far we only have 3 (three) books on SML. Because SML is a technical book for the university. However, I doubt anyone would buy this book if he or she was not a student. Besides, there are many errors in this book ... If you want an introduction to genuine programming, i suggest you read Teach Yourself C by Herbert Schildt."
3,the only reviewer from AMERICA!,"The only thing I liked about this book was that it reads fast- i got credit in school for reading the pages. What i didn't like was that on the back it says it shows kids what its like to be a twin. Even if you like this book, don't be fooled. I have friends WHO ACTUALLY ARE TWINS, and i read this with them. They gave me a list of about 50 stereotypes in this book that are not true. This is not a very sophisticated read, although I understand nine-year-old liking it. But once you turn the big 1-0, I reccommend you read Karen Hesse's ""Out of the Dust."""
5,Amazing Twin Act,"When I read this book, I soon realized that being a twin can be so awsom but it can also be a big problem. They loved their grandma very, very much. She reminded them so much of their mother Opal, that sadly left, but when their dad meats Rose, the problems start happening. First they have to leave their grandma, then Ruby and Garnet get into a big sister to sister fight. The fight gets solved but something else happens too. Find out what happens when you read this book, I know you'll love it! By Tia"
2,Good read but lacks references,While the book is quite interesting from a pilot's point of view it does lack proper sourcing when referring to FAA policies and/or airline policies and more. It reads like an essay from a university student who failed to grasp the notion of references.
5,The Inside Story,"If you are interested in the inside story of the attack on America, how the Federal Aviation Administration contributed to it, how airport security is still a Joke, and how the FAA and airlines are fighting to extend the time a pilot is confined to the cockpit, then this is the book for you.Carl T. Butterworth, Senior Captain, American Airlines, Retired Brigadier General, Air National Guard"
5,The Truth About Aviation,"Captain Power-Waters, drawing on his vast experience in aviation...brings together facts and information concerning the truth about aviation safety and the failures made by the agency tasked with overseeing it-the FAA.William A. Faville, Former Director, Safety and Technology, National Air Traffic Controller Association"
5,"Great for children and adults, easy clean up, keeps paints neat.","I purchased these paint trays for my grandchildren. They are perfect, not too large, and the clean up is super easy."
5,Lucia Popp,"This is a magnificent album; she had a superb voice and the person who selected the songs of this album picked her ""very best."""
4,A very good introduction to Japanese tales and mythology,"Overall, the book a very good general introduction to Japanese folk tales and mythology. The book is aimed at giving just enough information to orient the reader in Japanese culture, and then letting the tales do the rest of the telling. This is both good and bad. It puts the various stories deservedly at the center, but it also leaves the backround very undeveloped for use in research. People looking for a good reference book might want to search elsewhere. People looking for some really entertaining stories will find them here."
5,Cool,"This is an interesting read because it exposes people not familiar with Asian culture to some of their older stories and a few myths here and there, of course. I would recommend it just for the fun factor."
5,Worth it,"One tiny warning: The stories seemed a little more adult than others in the Pantheon Fairy Tale and Folklore Library. Otherwise, a wonderful book!"
5,"A ""Japanese 1001 Nights""","This book is a wonderful treasury of short tales from the Heian and Kamakura periods (Circa 1100-1300 CE) that will be of interest to anyone with an interest in Japanese literature. The stories that Royall Tyler has selected for this collection are often weird and gross but wonderful in their own way and often very funny as well. I have a difficult time imagining anyone turning to page 14 of this book and reading ""The Tapeworm's Sad End"" and not wanting to read the rest. This is a volume worthy of a place on the bookshelf next to that better-known collection of tales from the east, The 1001 Nights."
1,Bushnell Natureview 8x40 Binocular,The binocular is larger and heavier than I expected. Viewing of bachyard birds is an improvement over my 50year old pair.
3,missing something,"Overall, these are good, but they don't have a zoom feature. We felt we couldn't be without zoom, so they were returned. You just can't beat Amazon for customer service."
2,Looks used,"I haven't yet used the binoculars but I'm a little disappointed as they look used, with scratches, nicks on the metal parts. The case looks damaged and used (it has holes in it). I know all this doesn't reflect on how good or bad the product is, but I like my purchases to look brand new and pristine and this is the first time something I bought on amazon looks used. I cannot return them either as I traveled out of the country and will be gone a month. Argh. I'm miffed!"
4,Bushnell Natureview 8x40,It was a great find on Amazon that I purchased for a gift for a person that is really into bird watching. She loves them
5,"My husband LOVES this watch! Well-made, readable, comfortable.","My husband has thanked me again and again for this gift! It is simple, well-made, accurate, comfortable (with a nylon fabric band that does not add much weight), and for someone whose eyes are not as good as they used to be, its face is very readable. Highly recommended!"
2,poor quality,"i purchased the product for its simple, ""swiss made"" design. after wearing it for a few months, the case began to fog up, so i sent it back and had it repaired through the warranty. however, the watch also loses time significantly. not a quality product."
3,Round and round,"Not to be confused with the shorter, snappier 'Dancepieces', this is interesting, in that it's one of his larger, non-operatic works. Although dating from the early eighties it's closer in style to his cyclic music of the 1970's - 'Music with Changing Parts' for example, and although there are five tracks, the first four are more or less the same - tightly-woven, fast-paced organ / woodwind arepeggios, none of which are particularlly 'danceable'. Musically, it's nothing revolutionary, in fact it all seems like a big step backwards - Philip Glass has a recognisable style, and this conforms to it strictly. 'Dancepieces' is more varied, and a lot cheaper, and is, overall, a better album."
2,Basic frame,"This is just your basic steel frame. Sturdy enough unless you're gonna be a wild animal in bed all the time. A solid box spring with it's own strong center support is required, because as shown in the picture, there is no support across the middle. Not for very fat people.Took almost 3 weeks to ship.Beware they charged almost 50 bucks for shipping... it wasn't that heavy."
4,pretty good,I like it although I have to keep track of more peices and it does not hold that much but it is convenient.
1,A Political Soliloquy. Not one useful idea about privacy.,"Don't waist your money. From cover to cover Larry Sontag tells about who is watching and how these evil men will use this information against you. I wouldn't mind that if he gave one useful bit of information on how to avoid the problem. I would recommend ""How To Be Invisible"" by J.J. Luna or ""Bulletproof Privacy"" by Boston T. Party (although it is out of date, he still gives good advice.) Also ""You and the Police"" by Boston T. Party is a valuable read."
5,Worth every penny!,This isn't for the paranoid. Its for those who aren't paranoid enough.This one is a keeper.
5,"Very easy to read, but informative.","Medium sized book, but loaded with interesting and valuable information"
1,Not what they use to be,I've been wearing Gold Toe Fluffies for years but now no more. Unfortunately they are no longer made to the same standard and are thin and cheap feeling...
5,Delicious!,Very good casting and storyI will recommend itI would like to see the seven others seasons for Zone 1
1,I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE REVIEWS,"Usually I can rely on the reviews from Amazon buyers, but in this case they let me down BIG TIME. I could only watch the first hour, then I instantly put it back up for sale. The characters are so bad it is almost laughable. This might as well be Flo at the restuarant with Alice and Mel. How can this possibably get so many 5 starts? We need to investigate this one. I dare anyone to watch this program."
5,OMG the women are HOT!,"Normally I'm not really into prison shows, but a friend of mine taped this show in the UK and sent it to me. Holy wow! This isn't your typical Prison show! No way! This one is chock full of what I like to call the lovely lesbian liberation. haha I kid. But seriously, this show is great. Very suspenseful, intriguing, entertaining, and SEXY! If you're getting tired of the same old crap on the toob here in the U.S. you really should pick this up. It's got everything a show needs to get a rise out of you!"
4,"Intense, quality dramatic series","I absolutely love this show, a fan of dramatic television like Oz, The Wire and Six Feet Under, Bad Girls profiles the inmates of HMP Larkhall. The women are crazy, dangerous, eager and bad, bad girls. The first episode of season one starts with this totally dramatic scene that makes you realize you're watching a British show, it is edgier and more intense then anything you've seen before.I can't wait to buy this box-set and hope to see subsequent seasons out on DVD soon!"
5,Awesome show,"I came across the show by accident & I've been hooked ever since. I absolutely love it & hope it continues. Season 7 started and it started with a bang. Finally, what I was hoping & waiting for actually happened. I thought what happened to Fenna would never happen. He always got away with murder (literally). I got my husband hooked on it too. So we watch it faithfully everyday. I hope the series continues as long as an American Soap Operas do - for years to come."
2,Marginally Functional,"The issues I've had with these hooks are:* The pins that stick into the partition wall fabric are very blunt and do not penetrate the fabric well at all* The hook portion does not have much actual space between it and the backing, so it's not particularly useful"
1,Minnesota 24/7,"I grew up in Northern Minnesota near Lake Vermilion. I do a lot of snow shoeing, ice fishing, snowmobiling, hiking, camping, etc. I was very disappointed that there weren't any types of these pictures in the book. Minnesota is a lot more than the fast life of the city and those that can't experience the wilderness of it, are missing out on a lot. There are so many beautiful National Forests and lakes in Minnesota, it was very disappointing not to see any of these."
4,A good ending to a four-book (unofficial) series,"Loving Katherine introduces the Devereaux family while Maggie's Beau (Shay has good supporting role) and The Seduction of Shay Devereaux continue their story. The Marriage Agreement, is the last one. This book started off very well. I felt it sagged a bit in the middle, but I was also getting interrupted often during that part of the book, so it could be just my perception. In any case, the story does change pace toward the end. All in all, a good read."
1,Looking for help on Programming DTS with .NET?,"I was looking guidance on how to program DTS with .NET; sadly, this book misses the mark with 2 of 3 crucuial learning steps poorly coded (PackageSave, particulary). The examples do not work, and errata does not appear to be available on-line. Visit MSDN and other helpful sites on DTS & .NET (don't worry, there are a few good ones).Although the chapter on DTS is helpful in setting up your libraries, etc., you don't get stars for half-finished, or almost-working code..."
4,Street Scene: An American Musical/Opera,"I list this in both my Musicals and Opera.. I read a review , not of this production,, but of an operatic one , comparing it to ""louise"".. I'm amazed at how fast Weill adapted to the american idiom..I thinks his best work was with Brecht and Ira Gershwin.. that being said.. this is a good recording encouraging me to see,, if I can find one, a production..Anne Jefferies,, I believe was in a revival of kismet and is georgeous.."
5,A New concept of collaboration,"Larry Warren in his book :""Anna Sokolow The Rebellious Spirit"" writes: ""In ""Oklahoma!"" and ""On the town"",Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins had pioneered in the use of dance to further the plot of a musical, but their language was based on a ballet vocabulary. In Street Scene Anna proved that Social-dance forms have an inherent dramatic powers when they are artfully used as an expression of the society that created them. Ten years later Robbins used his genius to bring this concept to its fullest expression on Broadway in West Side Story""."
2,Better than Jalapeno Chips but Still not Right,"I like Pringles Potato Crisps, that is the original variety. These Chili Cheese chips don't exactly have that genuine Chili Cheese taste that they are trying to deliver. They tasted rather strange just as the Jalapeno Chips did. I did not like these."
1,Pointless,"Though I've enjoyed some of White's other books, I couldn't finish this one. It was too boring, too academic, and though I'm a francophile, too *french* (he's neutered the english language...taken away its strength)"
1,"What ""best of""??","All I can say is that whoever made the selections on this set, has no idea what the ""Best"" of Christa Ludwig is. It's certainly not what's on here. About the only things here that qualify are the duet from Norma with Callas and the Liebestod. Beyond that, you'd be better off building your own ""Best Of"" for this once in a life time artist."
1,never used this product,I never had a chance to use this- I changed to a mostly fruit and veggie diet with grains and a little protein with no added sugar and it seems to be working.
2,Thorough yet dull.,"This book is required for PoliSci 215 at IUPUI. It is, in a word, dull. The writing style is reminiscent of a phone book. The sentences and paragraphs are overly long. The information is organized in such a way as to remind one, upon reading it, of punching one's way out of a paper bag. I can't get no traction !"
4,A Flutist's Intro to Bolling,"Get this cd if you want to hear Bolling's works for flute before deciding if you would like to perform them. A great cd overall, maybe another brave flutist would like to redo these works? Although the late Jean-Pierre Rampal was known for doing 'the Picnic Suite' and 'Suite For Flute and Piano' I would like to add another artist to my collection."
3,Very basic,"This book is good only for people who are really discovering the online world. Basically it's a list of web links with a one page comment giving a high-level summary on the site's content. Don't expect to find advanced tips driving you to unknown features of a web site. Some of the sites mentioned don't exist anymore, but this is understandable given what happened in the dot com industry. On the positive side, it's interesting to note that even if the book is published by Microsoft, the Microsoft's web sites are not getting more visibility (some actually would deserve it)."
3,another Interesting production,"What I liked about it was how uncomfortable it made me feel. Some of the singing is great. Yes, Cleopatra has a pet, a pet crocodile that is. This production has many laughable staging moments theat were irrelevant and in bad taste, but a common practice these days when presenting Opera. I wonder if the plot was intended to have any relevance when it was first presented by Handel."
5,Perfect,"Item was exactly as discribed, and fit my KitchenAid Blender perfectly. Shipping was very timely. Thank you."
3,READ THIS FIRST,"This is only the jar. You also have to buy the blade, blade gasket (sealing gasket), base/collar and lid.Also, it does NOT work with the blender model #KSB560!!! I didn't learn this until I'd already had it delivered by Amazon and went to the Kitchenaid website to figure out what parts I was missing. Check their website out before buying anything!!!"
1,not as pictured,had to return because does not have lid or bottom. If you only needed the glass portion I'm sure it is fine. BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT IS PICTURED. This the first time I have ever had to return something from Amazon.
5,Excellent (cap/lid not included),"It's the real Kitchenaid thing and it fits perfectly.It does not chip with the white platic lid shown in the photo. I didn't expect it to, but just FYI."
3,PLEASE HELP,Does anyone know if this glass replacement jar works on Kitchenaid Blender model# K8B5ER? Thank you all very much! Mary
4,A moving story with memorable characters.,This was one of the few Edgerton books that I had not read. It is an enjoyable story with a bit more sadness than the typical humorous Edgerton tale. The characters are still quirky southerners. The play against brothers reminded me of Jim Harrison's Legends of the Fall - I even pictured Meridith as Brad Pitt (the movie version). The use of all the different narrative voices was creative ( especially the vine) Thinking back I can't believe so many stories were woven together so effectively. I'll remember this story always.-It's one of those.
5,My All-Time Favorite,"This is absolutely my favorite book, I truly wish it was my family he was writing about.Edgerton is by far the best Southern author writing today."
1,Pretty Gosh Darn Awful!,Nothing happens in this awkwardly constructed little book. The characters just talk (for a page or two)...and talk and talk. If you like this sort of thing (plotless yammering) you should hang out at the local diner and listen to the folks carry on.
5,Bravo!,"This is a wonderful book that will stimulate your creative juices. I'm the author of ""Thinkertoys,"" and ""Cracking Creativity"" and read most of what hits the market. This book is a must ""buy"" for anyone who is seeking to become more creative in their business or personal lives. Bravo to the authors for a job well done!"
2,not a heavy duty shredder,"I do not understand the 5 star ratings this machine has gotten. I find that after about 50 pages of shredding, the machine over heats and has to be shut down for at least 30 minutes before it recovers. In my opinion this is due to a design flaw in which the motor is totally in cased with no ventilation and then placed in a trash bin.I would have rated it one star except that the machine does an excellent job of shredding. If you are an occasional user, this machine is ok and preferable to a strip shredder for confidentiality. If you are a heavy user, look for a different machine as I am doing."
1,Won't handle thin paper.,"Zero stars. I bought this for a specific application which was to shred newspaper for recycling. Unfortunately this shredder won't handle paper that thin. Would have been nice if Amazon's technical information on the product included the fact that the information was based on 20# or thicker paper. The box the shredder came in had this printed on the outside of the box ""Shreds up to 10 sheets of 20# paper...""Anyway, it won't turn newsprint into the advertised dimensions. Seems to handle 20# paper fine. I wish Amazon had included that information in the product listing."
1,Say it ain't so!,"Season two?! Are you kidding me? How did this get picked up again?The only thing this show manages to teach you -- and teach you well it does -- is never to sell anything to a pawn shop. Head for eBay instead.The show consists of one segment after another of some chump getting way less for his item than he could have, had he been a little smarter about it.Extremely unsatisfying TV."
4,History Taught by Regulars,Can tell that the 'guys are becoming more comfortable with the cameras'. I enjoy the deal making and the items brought to the store.
4,Fun to watch !!!,Fun to watch and it's just amazing what people bring in ! Must take a lot of cash to run this place ! Have fun ! mpc
2,Bought one wish I hadn't,"I bought one after returning to playing after many years. This model is wierd. The neck is narrower than standard tenors. It will not take a standard size body plug. The bell and the body are two pieces held together by something what looks like a hose clamp. Because of the two piece body, it arrived with a post that was bent when someone dropped the package, causing F, E, D, C, and B to not work. It bent becacus of the 2 piece design. The post was straightened but the low D is flat. Rest ok after repairs."
4,Easy to use,"This is a very compact and easy to use pedal board. I use 5 stomp pedals, a wah, and a volume pedal. All of these pedals easily fit in this board. Very quick set up and break down. I unzip it, pull out my wah and volume pedals, plug the wall-wart into the board and into the wall and I'm done. Breaking it down is just as easy. Not very much protection against impact but its small enough it will fit in the back seat of a car along with your guitar. A little expensive but worth the cost if you need quick and easy set ups and have limited space for transport."
2,"The worst ""Planets"" I've ever heard","Disregard the review by Mr.Majeska. This is the worst ""Planets"" I've ever heard and I've heard about 25 or so in my day. I don't like Maazel's Mars the most. It just isn't played very well by the French orchestra and Maazel's interpretation is just about as awful. I think to have a successfull suite Mar's just has to be good and no such luck here. The rest of the suite was kind of mediocre but not near as bad as ""Mars"" was. Maazel is a good conductor but just isn't in this particular instance. There are so many versions of the ""Planets"" that you don't need to mess with this one. Try Karajan's DG version from 1981 (Mr.Majeska is completely and totally wrong in his comments about it. It's the best version out there). You might give Levine, Dutoit, and Gardiner a try too. Sorry but this version of the ""Planets"" is a non-starter."
1,It's Tosh,"Calm down, Andrea. Filippa Giordano really can't sing, technically. Her voice is thin and inflexible, her technique ragged. It comes down to a matter of taste: if you like 'popera' you'll like this. For my part, the clincher was the duet with Frida from ABBA, who sounds like a bullfrog."
4,The Beatrix Potter Knitting Book,"As a collector of all things to do with knitting, I ordered this book to add to my collection. It is a great book for it's time period and is all I thought it would be. Nice patterns, although old, but sometimes old comes back into style. I love it."
3,Not good for 3 year olds,"I bought this for my son because he loves the v-smile and the wiggles. I have to agree that the games, even on easy, are just too hard. He has no problems with the other games for the system. I gave it three star because he still tries to play it because he loves the wiggles."
4,My Kids Love It,"I purchased this game for my 3.5 year old son because he is a wiggles fanatic! Having read the reviews prior to purchasing it, I was a little wary, but I am glad that I bought it. My son is perfectly capable of playing the games by himself. The only one that he can't do is the Jeff game with the addition. He and his sister, who is six, both play and learn from this game. Adults who can't navigate it, hmmm? It is educational; it is fun; it is workable by three year old children, and mine would play it for hours if I would let them. In fact, they argue over it to the point that I am buying a second vtech system and another wiggles cartridge."
2,"Works, sort of","After running some iron-on fabric label tapeBrother Fabric 1/2 Inch Iron-On Tape - Retail Packaging, Navy Blue on White (TZeFA3) - Retail Packagingthrough myBrother International pt-1650 P-touch Handheld Labelerthe head was hopelessly clogged.I wasted a lot of tape trying to clear the printing head to no avail. I tried cleaning per instructions with a dry cotton swab. No luck.I bought this ridiculously expensive cleaning tape and though a lot of dirt can be seen on the tape (use ""Feed Only"" not actually printing) it still didn't print cleanly on regular labels.Finally, I took a swab and some rubbing alcohol and cleaned the head. Now it works.This tapes does clean the schmootz off the rollers, so it's not a total waste, but too expensive for what it is."
3,Fun to watch,It is a little campy but fun to watch. Old school is still good! It is interesting to see howsome of old Hollywood got there start.
5,Good book,My child likes the book. She is an A student but used to hate grammar and often got B for English due to lower scores for grammar tests. The book obviously helped her.
4,Excellent Workbook - but no answer key!,"The exercises in this workbook are fantastic. These concepts are definitely useful when it comes to standardized testing for Language Arts and English grammar. However, if the teacher using this resource isn't well versed in English grammar then you'll also want to purchase the teacher edition with answer keys!"
3,It IS easy if you really don't know anything,"This is just the basics. Really, even though it is put out there for high school, it could be done on an elementary or junior high level. My kids did this in really a few days. If you don't know the basics though this does help."
5,Just the right price!,I was searching a few different websites for my daughters high school books. Amazon had most of them at great prices. Delivery was really quick. The book is almost like brand new. I will order from this vendor again!
4,Easy Grammar for 20 years!!,"I have been teaching in a private school for 20 years. I have been using this workbook since the beginning. It still holds up as the most solid workbook for language arts skills. My original teacher's edition is falling apart, but continues to be my most used workbook. Its approach is simple and straight-forward. It is easy for the students to understand and provides logical sequence of language arts skills. The children enjoy working from this book better than any of the other various publishers I use. I have used these practice pages for fourth graders through high school students. It is what the title says: Easy Grammar."
4,grammar made manageable,"This book is a great tool for teaching grammar to my active boys who hate ""dumb bookwork"". It sounds like they have bad attitudes, but they are bright, hands-on learners. Grammar has always seemed abstract to them. The lessons are clear, yet concise. The exercises re-enforce the concepts without excessive repetition. For my boys who hate to write, this workbook is easier for them to ""swallow"" while they learn basic grammar."
4,Great as a supplement.,My daughter really enjoyed zipping through this book. I did find that she needed a more text book approach to grammar. This has been a great way to introduce parts of speech.
3,Predominantly Christian Perspective,"There are some worthy psychological nuggets within Dr. Livingston's book for anyone experiencing ADHD personally or as a parent. If you are a Christian or you wish to learn more about Christianity, then this book will probably be useful. As for spiritual diversity, there is a smattering of respectful references to Buddhism, Hinduism and Islam, but they are secondary in importance. Dr. Livingston is dismissive of New Age spirituality and advises against witchcraft and nature-oriented paganism, categorizing them with Satanism. For those who find paganism valid and rewarding, from a spiritual perspective this book may be disappointing."
1,dismal video transfer,"Becky Sharp was the first three-strip Technicolor feature - state of the art in 1935. In the original it was exquisite and original Technicolor dye transfer prints will be pristine in colour quality whether scratched and worn from use or not.The DVD I received is clearly a transfer from video - and an extremely poor video at that. The sound is poor and the image quite appalling - to the point where we gave up after about 5 minutes viewing.The way that colour elements break down and separate is nothing to do with the DVD, the age of the film, or the Technicolor release print process - the colour layers cannot separate - it is however a classic indication of poor quality video as an intermediate in the transfer process.This DVD is an insult to any purist interested in seeing a milestone in movie production."
2,Faded public domain copy,"This film is shown from time to time on TCM. They show a pristine UCLA Film Archives restored film.Worth taping or DVDing if you have a recorder.The Alpha video copy is ,well,viewable."
5,Great Double Stroller,"This stroller is awesome for all types of terrain. It rides very smoothly and my almost three year old loves to sit in it whereas with other strollers he hardly sits at all. There is plenty of space to carry the essentials in the basket below. One drawback is there is no cupholder but I bought a ""Carry You, Sicily double stroller organizer"" and it works well enough to hold water bottles and my snacks and keys. I highly recommend this stroller!"
3,Worked well for a while,"I liked this stroller and it really ""rolls"" well with two kids, steers easily. also folds up nicely with one hand action. But the cloth material started to rip and I called the manufacturer and emailed but they never responded. Now it is past the warranty period and the stroller is nearly unuseable. I would have thought a company like this would at least respond to my emails and/or called but never one word from them."
2,whatta powerhouse!,I am the Big Scrumpy. The Big Scrumpy likes a BIG rock sound. Guitar and drums BIG. The big sound rocks the tight dresses. Cherry Valence is not the BIG sound... maybe a better sound for the Little Scrumpy. Like a cross between Wishbone Ash and an imported cheese.
1,Zonet KVM 3202 won't work with your Macintosh,"Oh, my hopes were high for a VGA/USB switch between an old Mac and a new MacBook Pro. But alas, these hopes were dashed when it became clear that the Zonet relies on a ""scroll lock"" key --- which simply doesn't exist on most Mac keyboards --- for USB switching. All calls to Zonet tech support proved fruitless, though I did get someone on the phone within a couple minutes."
5,A much needed book,"When I first picked up this book, I though it was simply a guide on how to find a job after graduation. Fortunately, it is much more than that. It gives some great advice on how to mentally prepare yourself to handle all that uncertanty that comes after getting that diploma. The author is very clear and concise. He doesn't overwhelm you with complicated terms or strategies. Using some of his personal experiences as examples, he provides you with a more optimistic and practical way to approach life in general. This one is for people who cannot stop worrying about the future or finding out what they want to do in life."
1,Concrete in Germany,"I purchased this book because I specifiy concrete and architectural concrete. 85% of this book were projects that have concrete in them, but nothing specific, just basic overall pictures and no information about concrete. The 15% that had to do with formwork and concrete was basically useless to me because it was basically a translation of German to English, using German and European standards, nothing that we can use here in the US.I was disappointed never the less and have returned the book. If Amazon had said something about this book was intended for Germans who read English, I would have not purchased it."
4,The Catalans,"An excellent early work by Patrick O'Brian. It was fascinating to see the developing author of the Aubry/Maturin novels in this book. Even though the characters and story line were completely different the fledgling artist was clearly present. A very nice tale, indeed, from the 1950's."
3,Patrick O'Brian's early work,"After finishing the entire Aubrey/Maturin series, which I thoroughly enjoyed, I wanted to try his early works and found the Catalans somewhat lacking in plot. However, the characters were well developed, the tight family relationships are very interesting and the book is worth reading. But this story cannot compare to the richness of the Aubrey series which is based on early 19th century British naval history."
2,decent,"This camera worked for about 3 dives. The button on the outside housing that turns on the flash broke off, which pretty much is a necessity underwater so now the pics don't turn out good. Also, the little crank that is supposed to wind the film in sometimes does, and sometimes doesn't, and I had to ruin film learning this. There is really no way to tell from the outside whether its fully wound or not. The camera also jams half way through the film more times than not.Good for 1-2 uses, you'll get about 4 decent shots out of a whole roll of film, but I'm saving up for underwater housing for my regular digital camera. Vacation pictures are just too important to mess up with this thing."
4,Great inexpensive waterproof 35mm camera,"I bought this camera to take some snap shots while diving anddidn't want to spend $300 or so on a digital UW camera. So I tried this one and found that it has a rugged case, is waterproof, and simple to reload with film (Snap Sights' previous model was cumbersome to reload).Pics come out best with 400 or 800 speed film. Just watch that youare no further then 10 ft from the object; as the flash will notcarry the distance. Pics of items closer then say 5ft will be fuzzy.The user just has to remember to press the flash-on button and wait for the LED ready light to show that its ready to shoot the next pic.For the money I spent, if its lost or breaks then there is nothing tocry over.Happy diving."
1,"Was waterproof, BUT........","I purchased and used this camera in September and the picture quality is what you would expect for paying under $20. Blurry and dark pictures, but what I really was upset about is the fact that the rewind crank did not work and I had to go into a dark room and take the film out and rewind it myself. I then threw the camera away."
1,Snap Sights 35mm camera.,"This thing is a hunk of crap. The camera is very cheap plastic, and broke when trying to load the second roll of film. don't waste your money. Spend a little extra and get something a bit more quality. The outer water proof case is the only quality thing about it, and its usless without the cheap camera."
5,very beautyful earrings,"I just received this earrings in the mail. By the way shipping was the fastest ever I ordered those Wednesday and got them today Friday WOW. I found them in the Gold box and ordered them for a fantastic price, I wasn't sure though that when I would get them home that I would actually keep them, but when I tried them on they were just stunning even my two kids told me those earrings are a definit keeper. Buy them even for the regular price they are great great earrings. I would buy them ten times over again. Thank you Amazon.com for the speedy shipping and the great products you bring to us."
3,I Scream You Scream,"Sometimes a title says it all. ""Songs for Ice Cream Trucks"" is a delightful set of tunes that ring bells in your childhood memories. Hearst is one of the collaborators on One Ring Zero'sAs Smart As We Are, and the sly sense of humor carries over. You can look at these tunes as ironic and let your friends know you're cool, or you can just take them at face value and smile.Stay clear if you're scared of ice-cream vendors the same way you're scared of clowns."
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"The music on this CD is not like anything I've heard coming from any ice cream truck before. Maybe it's ""new age"" but I prefer the old time stuff better."
4,An Exciting Performance,"Bronfman adds a great touch to these two Prokofiev sonatas. The seventh is excellent. The precipitato is fiery fast and an exciting performance.The eighth was equally enjoyable.He provides the mystery and wonder needed in the first movement, the dreaminess of the second, and the feelings of victory and confidence in the third. His interpretations provide a new outlook to these two very difficult sonatas. This is a definite steer from the traditional, but Bronfman stays on the right track."
2,Not so good...,"I love the 7th sonata and this version just seems to miss the point. It's sad to see such a wonderful piece of music be so strangely interpreted. The wonderful, fiery 3rd movement is reduced to what seems to be almost random emphasis -- the amazing melodic thread through it is completely lost. My favorite version of the 7th is Anthoni di Bonaventura's on the Sine Qua Non label which is apparently not in production anymore."
3,BIG one!,I bought this cage for my 2 parakeets and now they are living in a hotel. It is about the size of six of them little cages that you can buy at wal mart. So far its durable...
3,Disappointed,"I received this much anticipated bird cage today. It was a replacement cage for my 18 year old male Cockatiel. As with the other cages being reviewed here, it came with no instructions. So, when I assembled the cart,it was wrong. On the second try, it worked but the shelf could not be added as there were no holes to insert the bars to hold it between the assembly. Also, one of the screw holes did not line up, so had to use a zip tie in place of it.The perches are iffy and do not fit tight. May have to monkey with them to make sure my bird does not fall."
2,Way overpriced!!!!,"I was considering buying this cage for my 2 parakeets, and decided to check around first. You can buy this exact same cage on Ebay for $41.99!! The listing starts around $39. with a buy it now for $41.99. I just got one for $41.00. and the shipping is only $18. Still a big savings."
4,Another pleasing effort,"Although I own more than one of Tinsley's albums, this is the first one I've reviewed. His hard edged guitar sound and gruff vocals remain but there's also a bit more here. There are elements of jazz, psychedelic 60's rock and Stax sounding sweet soul music. It's as if he discovered that versatility is the key to not being pegged as just another blues rock guitarist. Recommended if you like Robert Cray or Jimmy Thackery."
5,It's About Time...,"...that an artist of Ellis' stature and obvious talent has a chance to fly out of his pigeon-hole and stretch his wings. It seems that The Hard Way has given him just that opportunity. Having followed Ellis' career for over twenty years (and always suspecting that there was more to him than the ""guitar slinger"" persona foisted upon him by marketing types,) his latest effort is a validation of those suspicions; This ain't your daddy's 1-4-5 blues, but a mature synthesis of a lifetime's worth of experiences earned ""The Hard Way""."
4,"Readable, concise history","This is a very readable, but concise, history built around the construct of 6 beverages.Four stars, as some of the history seemed forced to fit the framework of the six glasses.It was an enjoyable read, particularly for the casual history reader."
3,Great idea. Needs a great writer.,"This is a fun book with a nice premise. Sadly, the early chapters are heavy going. The writing is, well, dull. When my son saw this book had been included on his mandatory summer reading list, he thought we might enjoy reading and discussing it as a family, and he should have been correct. At the end of the process, we did truly enjoy discussing the substance, but it was a long hard month before we all finished the text. The later chapters flow better, and some of the observations about World War II and Coke's business plan are fascinating. In sum, the research is great, the thesis is fun, and having at least one of the beverages right at hand while reading it is imperative. We went for caffeinated options. Your mileage may differ."
2,"I second the ""good-idea-poor-execution"" sentiment","...completely. The flow of ideas, the depth of observations, and the style of prose kept me feeling EXACTLY the same as if I was watching a single-episode TLC special on the entire history of Egypt."
5,A Marvelous Book,"This is a well written, easy to read book about the history of drinks and what difference they made to the world. Mr. Standage takes on beer, wine, spirits, tea, coffee, and... Coca Cola! I thorougly enjoyed it."
3,Did not Engage Me,"I see that a lot of people loved this book. I did not. It was a slow go for me - I kept looking at the ""percent read"" on my Kindle. History comes alive in different ways for different people so I can see how this clever approach of history through beverages might appeal to some.For me, it was a whirlwind tour of world history through strings of loosely connected anecdotes and fun facts about beverages. Nothing really stuck with me. It wasn't particularly well-written or edited. Here is the last sentence: ""When you next raise some beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, or Coca-Cola to your lips, think about how it reached you across space and time, and remember that it contains more than mere alcohol or caffeine. There is history, too, amid, its swirling depths.""In a moment, I will be raising some wine to my lips at my book club, anxious to hear what everyone else thought about this book!"
3,"nice anecdotes and perspectives, but was missing something.","The book is organized into six sections: Beer, Wine, Spirits, Coffee, Tea, and Coca-Cola. The author does a great job describing how each these beverages evolved from their almost accidental origins and influenced history in their own way. Overall nice perspectives and anecdotes, but it just felt like something was missing in the writing style."
2,Misleading and biased,"This book is a big disappointment. This is not great O'Farrell ""An Utterly Impartial History of Britain or 2000 Years of Upper-class Idiots in Charge"" by any means.Author seriously pushes a silly theory and supports is with a rather biased selection ofhistorical facts.Simple example - he ignores the fact that Bible is considered as a reliable historical source at least since the nineteen century archeological discoveries, and ignores the fact that Bible is entirely ""wine"" culture a 1000 years before Greeks, beer is mentioned only twice, while wine and vineyards are in every chapter. Then he goes on to claim that the ""Last Supper"" (which was actually a Passover ritual with 4 cups of vine) was a strongly influenced by a cult of Bacchus...Come on - eating Guinea Pig at the Last Supper in Cuzco Cathedral is at least funny:[...]Enough said - but compare what he writes about coffee with other books, at least ""Quick Silver"""
3,Required School Book,"Bought this for my daughter, who needed it for her history class in high school. It serves its designated purpose."
3,I haven't read this yet.,I haven't read it yet. Maybe I will get a chance some time soon. This review process really sucks time.
1,Ugh!,"The author has no knowledge of verbs besides ""to be;"" consequently, the prose sits like flat beer. The topic had such potential--what a pity that the author doesn't."
4,An informative view of the uniique history of beverages,"This book takes a unique view of history. It describes how six different beverages have influenced the world. Looking at it all from the point of view of beer, wine, spirits, coffee, tea and Coca Cola, this book is full of information about these drinks. I learned a lot from the book as it taught me more than I ever thought I needed to know about the how beer has been around for centuries and how tea and coffee influenced world history and the place that Coca Cola has taken in the past century.The book is full of facts and an easy read. I loved its point of view as well as the clarity in which the author described all these drinks. Every page is full of information and I appreciate the scholarship that went into explaining all the details of the manufacture of these drinks as well as describing the impact each of them had on history.I totally enjoyed this book. Not only was it interesting, I learned something as well."
3,"Entertaining and light, But lots of misprints","Many many typos and errors in Kindle edition, irritating since some words are so garbled they are nothing but a string of random letters. Hopefully there will be an updated corrected version down the line.That being said this is a fun and playful history book that takes itself seriously while still being light at the same time. I believe there is a paragraph in which the author jumps from Alexander the Great to the latter half of the Western Roman Empire. Glossing over seven hundred years of history in fewer than 100 words without coming off as ridiculous is a feat in itself."
3,It's interesting,"It is a very interesting book. I enjoyed learning when and where the different drinks came from, how they came to exist. It didn't seem to slow down at all as some books do. If you want to know all about the origins of beer, wine, etc. then this is the book for you."
5,Good History of Drinks,Enjoyable book from a historical perspective. Detailed yet very interesting.Liked the part on beer. It's an interesting concept to write a book about.
3,Interesting,"This is fairly interesting account of how six beverages helped shape history, but it is by no means a towering work of scholarship. Nor does the author pretend that it is. Rather, it's a pleasant survey of world history and the role that six beverages played in the developopment of it. Well-written and not too deep. I guess you could write any number of world histories and link the development of humankind to this phenomenon or that and, in so doing, entertain readers. And that's what this author did. It was a good change of pace and on the whole, enjoyable and informative."
5,History of the World inSix Glasses,Great book--downloaded on I-pad. Very interesting history from the perspective of beverages--starting with the Neanderthals. Amazing--had no idea beer went back so far.
4,Fun!,"This work presents the history of six drinks that are popular today and that appeared at various moments in the past: beer, wine, rum, coffee, tea and Coca-Cola.This provides a pretext to summarize the history of mankind and to highlight links that are often overlooked, say between rum production and the slave trade or between tea consumption in the UK and the prevalence of opium in 19th century China.Some may feel that the author is at times overly generous in his assertions, for instance that coffee is a direct cause of the French Revolution.Still, the original approach and the brevity of the work make it highly enjoyable."
4,Cheers and Beers to the ages,I like history but I especially like it when it is concisely and clearly explained in a way provides a new outlook on the world. This is that kind of book. Placing these six drinks into the historical development of our world compels me to imagine similar drinks today. What will the drinks be in a book written in a few hundred years......only water?One of my new favorite history books....right up there with William Cronon's Environmental History of Chicago and the Midwest.
5,Yummy,"These cookies are a very nice treat for the children to bake themselves, and are as tasty as the cinnamon rolls. I would recommend the dessert refills over the mac and cheese for this oven."
2,Broke quickly,"We loved the toy, but it only lasted a few hours because the string broke. We tried to fix it by adding a new string, but that didn't work. I love the toy, so I wish they would make it so it last longer than an hour."
1,disappointed,My 6 year old loves flying toys and was so excited to find this toy under the tree christmas morning. such a simple toy to bring such joy followed by dissapontment. The teeth on the pulling mechanisim would not grab the blade to start rotation so the blade jumped off the pulley adn flew about sinch inches and to the ground. Very dissapointed. No big financial loss but this product is a dissapointment wish for my sons sake i had better review
2,Great Fun...Poorly Made,"This toy is a blast but, unfortunately like so many things today, the quality is very poor. We bought this for our 4th of July picnic and it was super fun. WE all enjoyed it from ages 5 to grandparents. It soars and flies wonderfully. However, the string didn't last as long as the picnic and we were left holding a pull-string toy with no more pull-string. Really, how many brains does it take to realize that if you're manufacturing a toy reliant on a pull-string that the string needs to be strong and durable?We liked the toy so much we're going to try to fix the string. But it would have been nice if it was made to work and last in the first place."
2,Didn't last long,"This is a very fun toy and my 3 year old loved it, but it only lasted 2 days. The string broke and my husband tried fixing it 3 times and every time he fixed it after a few pulls it broke again. Disappointed."
2,"Grandson loved the toy, workmanship horrible, disappointed boy","Our grandson had the best time with this toy, UNTIL IT BROKE, and that did not take long. My husband and my grandson were having a great time with this toy. I am sure the launching string was pulled fewer than 30 times and it became disconnected from the handle and was not fixable. My grandson was so disappointed. I called the company 3 separate times and was told the ONLY person who handles complaints about this toy was, conveniently, not in but would have her call me. Never happened. Granted, the toy was not expensive but my grandson's disappointment is priceless."
2,Not so pleased,I was excited to purchase this but after playing with it three times the pull string started fraying and broke.
3,"Great diagnostics, not much on treatments","Comprehensive professional reference about rabbit care, diseases and disease processes. It is British. There is scant information on how to treat the things it helps you diagnose. Not a lay person reference, but geared toward veterinary professionals"
3,Quite small,"Fun little football, but it's smaller than a junior size football. It's pretty solid and not as spongy as I thought it would be, but still it's fun to throw around."
3,Great at first but didn't hold up well,"My kids and I had a lot of fun playing with this for the first week we had it, but then it started to get cracks in the foam part. I knew that we only had limited time left! I was right, as a couple of days later my son had picked out big chunks of the foam. We need something that will last a bit longer. For younger kids, this probably isn't the best choice."
4,Fun Football that is Easy to Throw!,"I bought this for the family in hopes it would get the kiddos outside a bit more. While that didn't happen exactly that I hoped, this is a very fun football that can be taken anywhere.This is a must have when going to the park, camping, family get togethers, and is softer than a pigskin so the little kids can still enjoy it."
5,Black Max Football,"Spins well and is very easy to hold for younger kids. It's soft enough that I don't have to worry when it hits my son. My son LOVES this football! For the price, this is an excellent choice."
3,Best Nerf Style Ball but it will not last,"Easy ball to throw and catch but it does not last. First time playing with it on the pavement a quarter sized piece of foam ripped off near the center. Chunks of foam continued to rip off during the year, such that the middle yellow ring will on stay put during throws. That seems to have destroyed the integrity of the ball. Deciding if it is worth getting a new ball every year."
3,Good for young kids,This football is a little on the light side to get any distance or a really good spiral out of it. This is probably ok for kids that are looking for a lighter alternative to a regular foortball or a youth football.
5,"great fun, excellent spirals","It is a great ball, lots of good fun. We played catch for about 1.5 years with it. Started falling apart recently, will replace immediately. The dimples in it, like a golf ball's, seem to be the key to its excellent design. Makes it easy to grip for kids and adults."
5,Best nerf style football ever,"This is by far the best soft (Nerf) style football ever. Throws wonderful spirals, and is very easy to catch.This is my second set of them. It is also awesome at the beach. Floats well and it fights through any tough wind.Overall, a great buy, and a great football"
1,not worth the money,"i thought this football would be enjoyed by all my kids. the first day out , it fell apart from the middle. i dont recommend this ball for anyone. not worth it"
2,cat collar,Nice collar with nice colors but falls off my cat due to the clasp.Better off with a regular collar with a regular clasp.
2,Not As Good As the Old Ones,"I have to agree that these pots are not anywhere near as good as they were before (I've kept a 4-cup of this brand for personal use for many years.) They don't pour well as the spout isn't properly formed. You have to hold it over the sink when pouring... forget about having it on your good dining table! Mine finally broke and I am so glad that I can throw it out and get a new one. At this price and this pedigree, you should be getting a good solid everyday pot. When I was last in England I didn't see one ""brown betty"" and I can see why. This pot has reached the status of tourist junk."
2,There are better options,"I own the 2-cup version of the Brown Betty. It looks nice and makes a nice 'cuppa' but the big flaw is in its design. The spout is constructed in such a way that dripping when poring out your tea, is simply unavoidable. Not recommended."
3,Poor Spout Design,"Purchased 2 Brown Betty's: 2 & 4 cup capacities. The Brown Betty retains heat better than other tea pots I own. The capacity is overstated, in that a cup is 8 ounces. The 4 cup version capacity is barely 3 cups. The biggest flaw is in the poor design of the spout. The spout drips at all times during pouring regardless if the pot is filled to 3 cups or only 1 cup. Tea must be poured over the sink; inconvenient and frustrating. I've gone back to using other teapots with the addition of a tea cosy. The Brown Betty's are now being used as a catch all. Cauldon Ceramics should change their marketing slogan to read ""Made in England Just Like Made in China."""
3,needs improvment,The spout was not configured to prevent spilling down the front of theteapot on to the table. Also the handle is a little small for a comfortable grip.
2,too messy to want to use,"There is no problem heating the pot, brewing the tea etc, as the pot was wrapped and shipped exquisitely well. The problem lies in the design os this BROWN Betty itself, namely the design of the spout which drips copiously and constantly regardless of the angle of the pot. Full marks to merchants for ddoing a great job, just let down by an unusable product. Sigh."
2,drippy Brown Betty teapot,"I am disappointed in the Brown Betty teapot from England. I have used this type of pot for years (mine broke) so i ordered the original thinking it would be the same. I did not want anything from China. The teapot drips whenever I pour, even when it is not full. Shame on the Brits for making such a bad design!"
3,"Handsome, wonderfully old-fashioned, but leaky","I love this teapot: it's simple and good-looking and unpretentious. But unless this is a flaw that only my particular pot has, this teapot does not pour well at all. It always leaves a puddle of tea on the counter or table. Very annoying!"
4,Gave it as a gift; my friends are delighted with it,"The friends to whom I gave this (as a hostess gift) were very impressed, very pleased, and think it's beautiful. I haven't heard how well it works, so can't comment on that."
1,Poorly designed spout,"The teapot sent to me has a short stubby spout. I could tell from its design that it would drip during a pour. After brewing my first pot, and pouring a couple of cups, calling it a drip is being kind. English teapot makers know how to make teapots that do not drip. I have had many. I don't know what went wrong with this one."
1,"Rip-off, plain and simple.","You should anotate that this joker out of Louisiana is NOT theJim Morrison from the Doors. He claims he is channeling Jim's words.He's just ripping people off. His publisher is B of A something or other, but it's a scam. Anyway, thanks for the time.Dread and the Hillside Dance"
4,"retro yes, but good retro","I've seen some pretty bad reviews for this album on this site and I think these people are missing the point. The Ladybug Transistor obviously loves pop music of the sixties. That being said, if that isn't your favourite style, then why the heck would you even give this a listen? However, if you love Brian Wilson compositions, Burt Bacharach, Walker Brothers, Phil Spector, Belle & Sebastian, The Heavy Blinkers, heck, even the Byrds and so on and so on....pick this up immediately. In fact, pick up the previous album Albemarle Sound as well. Sure, they sometimes take things a little too far, sacrificing linear song structure just to show that they can switch time signatures and tempos with ease. The melodies are sweet and cheerful, and the lyrics are introspective and vague without sounding pretentious. If you love melodic pop music, with interesting chord changes and lots of waltz-y interludes and a somewhat baroque feel.....buy this."
2,going backwards,"this isn't a terrible record. it just isn't that good. if you like retro bands and you're thinking about getting married then i suggest you ask the ladybugs to play your wedding. there are some good songs on this record though. ""nico norte"" and ""words hang in the air"" are quite good, however, ""catherine eizabeth"" (a faux middle ages rocker) and ""fjords of winter"" (from the little house on the prairie soundtrack?) are absolutely revolting. also, gary olson's wannabe scott walker vocals are a huge anchor and never let this record take off."
5,My netbook now has SPDIF cable-yay!,"Acer Ferrari newbook wouldn't tell me from customer service but THIS is the proper cable to get digital audio output over to my outboad DAC. My little netbook now has place of pride in a second small but very ""high end"" audio system in my study. The tip of this headphone jack cable has a hidden fibre optic wire to send digital out of the Acer using spdif-optical. The other end is your typical optical fibre optic spdif plug for audio ""in."""
2,"One year warranty warning, not enough","After getting this camera as a gift last Xmas(2005) i was pleased with the features and picture quality. However, when attempting to use it this Xmas (2006) i was greatly upset when it would not turn on at all. It works in the docking station only and a new battery does not fix it. I had only used it about 4 times in that first year and when contactin Kodak about a obvious defect, they blew me off and said it was out of it's one year warranty and all i could do was trade it in and buy a referbished lower end camera for about as much as i paid for this one. I am no longer a Kodak customer due to this and their response to my inquires. This is not to disuade anyone from buying this product, just know about their warranty and how they deal with them before buying."
3,Solid information,"This book, part of Barrons business series, is another fine addition to any library providing solid sales and management information. However, there are other better books on sales to help sharpen or keep sharp those selling skills."
3,50/50,Diana cooper has some interesting theories on Atlantis. Some feel like they miss the mark to me. I guess we won't know some things for sure until we convince someone to check the botem of the attlantic with a submarine.
1,directionless rambling of a made up mythology,"I used to be an avid fan of Cooper's; but after many experiences with validated falsehoods of her indulgant fantasies, I have learned that the ""connections"" she has is really no more advanced than my own truths. She would probably not fault me on that and encourage me to follow my own voice, but this work like all her others just rambles aimlessly with convoluted histories of a far away world that no one can know or have any basis for a timeline as to where it falls in the history of humanity (if at all). Yes, I paid for it but managed my Kindle to delete this tripe."
4,Liberty - What a great concept.....,"I have a special weakness for Liberty tales. This one is top notch with the right amount of excitement, intrigue, mystery, and adventure. Ben Kane as the tough no nonsense governor from Montana is what I would like to see in real life. He is still human though and the thought processes he goes through are, at least I think, quite realistic. All this makes for great read.Regards, Dr. Dan"
4,Belongs on every patriots bookshelf,"Great read. I could not put it down......so I read it on one day (speed reader, heh,heh).If one parallels the story with the actual stranglehold that the Fedgov is imposing on the citizens of our country, you can see the possibility's that can exist if and when people wake up and do something about it.We can say, ""hell no, I am not taking it any more"", and work at changing the system. Make the suckers answerable to the people and not to the lobbyists and power brokers in Washington, District of Criminals."
3,stretches credibility,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is a lively story that butts heads with some crucial current issues. It is no more ""poorly written"" than any other popular novel. People who are interested in the issues dealt with here are not likely to be interested in current presuppositions of fiction writing such as the axiom that characters must ""change.""My problem with the book is credibility. It is exciting to see one man standing up to any big and oppressive organization, whether business or government; yet, I can help thinking that there are many serious problems of which this author is unaware. I hope he (and other readers) won't think me presumptuous if I suggest the recent nonfiction book While America Sleeps: How Islam, Immigration and Indoctrination are Destroying America from Within."
4,Kane '08,"This is a great book, a must read for libertarians. Save time and buy it with the sequel ""Middle America."" The ""speeches"" are much easier to read then John Gault and offer a concise, contemporary and practical argument for libertarianism. For example, ""Statism has become the new religion. Instead of looking to God we have become conditioned to look to the state to provide for us. The left is doing what they continuously accuse the right of doing - trying to legislate morality - but they're doing it with public cash instead of the blue dog laws."""
4,The beginnings of Carey's fine run.,"Mike Carey, John Constantine, Hellblazer: Red Sepulchre (Vertigo, 2003)Red Sepulchre is the first book in what ended up being a three-book miniseries focusing on Constantine and Angie Spatchcock, neophyte wizard. We're introduced to Angie here, as Constantine meets her while looking for his missing niece, Gemma, and the two of them try to figure out what on Earth's going on with the building where Gemma's parents live. We also get the first bits of information about the Shadow Dog, which we'll meet later on, in another volume.Carey (Lucifer) was a good choice to bring into the Hellblazer universe; he's lower-key than Garth Ennis, but not so laid-back as Warren Ellis, and his books tend to strike the best balance of the various aspects of Constantine's character. Whether or not that's a good thing I'll leave to the reader to decide but I find them quite enjoyable. ***"
3,Doherty has Written Better,"This is one of the few books written by Paul Doherty (Michael Clyne's) that I had not read. First published in 1991, Doherty's writing style has vastly improved since then and he has become a leading light on the Medieval Murder Mystery scene.The book is set at the time of Henry VIII, and features Sir Roger Shallot, who is reciting his first journal to an old monk. The book has plenty of murder and intrigue involving Shallot, his friend and master Benjamin Daunbey, cardinal Wolsey and King Henry, and as with most of Doherty's books a puzzling plot for the reader to try to unfold, each suspect for one reason or another is eventually discounted until the final chapter.I enjoyed the book, but found it a little disjointed in the writing. As I said before, Doherty's style has now been honed to a fine art."
2,Do the producers understand opera seria?,"If you enjoy the singing of this cast, buy the CD. The spare sets only emphasize the visual activity of the singers, which is not only a poor substitute for genuine emotional intensity, but is too often distracting from both the dramatic moment and the music. Some of the stage business is very funny, Sesto's entrance with a bouquet of oversize flowers (we get the point) as are some of the actions of Ms. Nagelstad, but what they do is for buffa, not seria, especially in this story, which, while festive, is an at heart an instruction on governing and how a ruler may win the hearts of his people. And to you,""Aficianado,"" I and others who watched with me agree that there is, indeed, a woman entering on a potato, though baked not rotten. And the significance is . . . She is a hot potato? She is the sour cream? -- How about a performance that respects the genre and if possible is in period."
2,"Poor, plastic construction","I was very disappointed by the quality of these clips, especially given price compared to other similar clips available on Amazon. I no more than unpacked them and one of them snapped in two when I pinched the top to open it. The other three work ok, and do hold more pages than the other clips I have, but rarely do I need to hang large numbers of sheets. I would not order these again."
5,Very long of print cd,"If you are a fan of this band and have waited years now is your chance to hear one hell of a cd!! for fans of evoken and my dying bride, buy now"
3,Too late but not too bad,"If only Carreras and Ricciarelli had sung this in the 70s. His most handsome voice and her elegiac singing were perfect for Poliuto! Plus they looked great together on stage. Unfortunately they waited too long and the results are uneven. Neither has lost his/her wonderful phrasing but the voices are no longer reliable. They sing with much conviction and create interesting portrayals.Pons on the other hand, phones in his performance and shows off his large voice. Comparing last weekend's MET Cav/Pag performance and this early testament verified my prediction that his exemplary technique would ensure him a long career. The audience behaves well (too well?) and the sound is crisp.Under the aforementioned circumstances, the vote easily goes to the earlier live Poliuto with Corelli stealing the show, Bastianini a wonderful Severo and Callas fragile both vocally and dramatically (the latter being highly effective though)."
5,Brilliant!,"I rarely listen to the blues anymore, like Bebop it has become a fairlystale genre, mostly white guys that don't know when to take their footoff the gas. But every once in a while someone like Otis Taylor puts outan album that is blues based that is still the real deal. I think ofMr. Taylor as the musical descendant of Odetta as much as he is ofJohn Lee Hooker-Folk Based Trance Music might be a good title for whathe does, anyway I wrote this review just to balance out the idiot'sone star review that never even listened to this great album beforewriting his grievance."
1,Poor quality. Stones fell out often.,"Stones fell out of this ring. The company did replace it for my daughter. I don't think she kept contacting them each time though. Not good quality, but very pretty."
1,What a mess!,"We ordered this puzzle and the puzzle of Maine, both from the same maker. The Maine puzzle was fine. This one of Bar Harbor came with a damaged box, so damaged that we had to use yards of tape to keep it together so that it won't lose the puzzle pieces. Also some of the puzzle pieces appear to be damaged, as if it met with a heavy object. They do NOT fit together well, which ruins the whole concept of the puzzle. The shipping box was totally undamaged, so this had to happen before it was shipped. We have yet to put the entire puzzle together to find out whether puzzle pieces are missing, but we have our suspicions."
3,"Not as Good as ""Ghost World""","I read ""David Boring"" after being impressed by Clowes's previous graphic novel, ""Ghost World,"" but I was somewhat disappointed. Unlike the cynical and terminally ironic teenage protagonists of the earlier book, the title character of ""David Boring"" never really comes to life, and neither do the lesser characters. (One of the notable achievements of ""Ghost World"" was the way in which even the minor characters who appeared in only a few panels would take on sharply defined and believable personalities.) The story also never really takes off, and often seems to be a series of random, improbable incidents intended to give David Boring more reasons for his sullen depression- though the background narrative (never clearly defined) about mysterious terrorist bombings and biological attacks seems prophetic, since the book was published in 2000."
4,eccentric but interesting,"Dan Clowes creates characters and worlds that exist only in his mind ,but they are interesting nonetheless. He lacks the all out energy of an action packed entertainer like Miller and his books lack the unified tone of JIMMY CORRIGAN and I consider both Miller and Ware to be superior to Clowes but he is one of our best cartoonists and DAVID BORING is fine work even though the story is too surreal and cynical to have much of a pontless."
3,Underachieving,"I try to like Daniel Clowes, but I have trouble not viewing his work at crude and vulgar. The artwork is nice and his plot certainly creative, but it doesn't allow my mind to dwell upon higher thoughts and find tangents to meander with. David Boring is simply the story about a guy and his search for love. Twists and turns abound, but other than creating a unique story, they serve little purpose.It's obvious that Clowes has the ability to weave a great story, but in the end, he tends to keep the story simple and not flesh out the more intriguing plots, instead relying on sexual encounters to titillate the majority of his readers."
2,Sex life of Tintin,"Better the pastel-tinted gloom of Eightball (I have #23) than this morbid Lynchian romance for overgrown adolescents - or Austerian possibly? Incidentally, it hadn't struck me till reading this that Tintin never smiles, either. I thought the other reviewer's comment 'What's with the socks?' remarkably percipient, in a doubtless unknowingly Lynchian way. Anyway, this story's remarkably soxy.Full disclosure: I hated Mulholland Drive (my only Lynch) for not being Hitchcock (we wuz robbed!) and I can't hack Auster; now I'm even going off Tintin. But as you can see from the ** rating, David Boring has its moments. Depressive, moi?PS I shoulda posted this highfalutin (or, as we say, poncy) review over on amazon.co.uk. Apologies."
2,don't buy the hardcover,"As other reviewers have noted, the hardcover binding is defective; my book arrive with the binding falling out of the book. I will try the hardcover - thus this review is on the physical hardcover quality but I haven't been able to read it yet."
1,Just Delivered and Already Having Problems,"I just got the cart delivered and it came in a banded cardboard box. I opened the box and discovered one tire totally flat. I pumped it up but then heard a hissing sound coming from the area around the wheel hub. I called Precision but it was after hours and had to leave a message. Needless to say, this is not a good way to get started with the cart. I took over two weeks to get it delivered and I am guessing it will take equally as long to get a replacement wheel. I suppose this means the work I had scheduled for this weekend with the cart won't be happening anytime soon...thanks ""non"" Precision Products. With this lack of attention to detail, I am wondering what else is broken and/or missing."
1,Static is a killer !!!,"I'm sure this phone has nice features and all, but the most important things in any phone are (1) sound quality and (2) battery life. This phone is ABYSMAL in both regards. There is constant static in the background when you talk. (I turned off my wireless router, and the static persists.) Also I get about 3 calls before the battery dies. Who wants a phone like this??? Garbage. Complete garbage."
2,BUYER BEWARE!,"If you are going to purchase the MD681 for it's ""expandable"" feature then you are out of luck. I found ONE retailer (an online telecom site) that has the handset that goes with this phone and it's 150 bucks. It took a couple of calls and several transfers for motorola customer service to fess up to the fact that these handsets will no longer be available. They suggested that I purchase one of their new 700 series units instead if I wanted the expandable feature. I received this phone yesterday. It has not even completed it's first charge yet, and Motorola has already lost a customer. I cannot speak of how well this phone works. But I can say that motorola has exceedingly poor customer service."
1,vtech in disguise,"this phone is actually a vtech phone in disguise.i bought this phone to replace a vtech set that has performed poorly since day one. the motorola phone has the same buttons, in the same layout, the same menu options, the same graphics on the lcd screens. even the rechargeable batteries look the same. i will be returning this ""motorola"" phone as i know what to expect from it based on my past experience with the vtech.don't be fooled by the motorola logo, this is a vtech."
2,phone review,"when logging incoming phone numbers into memory, the phone does not record a 1 in front of the area code, therefor you can not use the Caller ID Log to dial out. If you try, you will only get an error message from your phone company stating that you must first enter a 1 in front of the area code. This makes this phone completely useless."
2,Not that great,The handset did not remain charged and i had to get a replacement from motorola.Now the no. 3 of the handset has to be pressed really hard or it does not recognise it.
4,Very solid but 2 major flaws...,"You cannot share address books between phones or between phones and the base unit as everybody has mentioned previously.What I haven't read is that you cannot check messages from the phones either, only from the base unit! Are you kidding me?All in all, I am satisfied with the quality of the phones and the sound quality is exceptional. I haven't had them long enough to comment on battery life or range, sorry.But, not being able to share address books or answer messages from the phones is a glaring oversight in the included features of this phone.George"
3,"Limited reception range, battery life, intercom capability.","I bought this phone after reading the glowing reviews in this section. This is a well designed, solidly built phone that generally works well. I bought it for frequency, intercom, and range considerations. The 5.8 GHz band interferes negligibly with my wi-fi network, which is great. However, the phone has its disappointments. The intercom rings the target handset instead of just buzzing and allowing speakerphone communication like a regular intercom system. The reception range is about half of my 7-year-old Panasonic 2.4 GHz phone; I have many dead areas in my (admittedly large) house. Finally, contrary to the experience of others in this section, the battery last little more than a day whith the phone out of the cradle, even with minimal use. This said, I have not yet found a significantly better 5.8 GHz phone."
5,I love this phone.....,"I have had this phone with an extra handset for about 2 months now and I could not be happier.I'm using this phone with my Vonage service and the call clarity is excellent. I can't speak too much for range since I live in a Townhouse, but the extra handset works fine on a different level of the house.I've been particularly happy with the speakerphone capability on the handsets. It sounds great and people can actually hear you when you are using it.The only thing that might bother people is that the buttons are softer than I'm used to on phones. I found myself thinking I had pushed the button several times when it was new, when in fact I had not. I have gotten used to this and it does not bother me anymore, but I wanted to mention in case this kind of thing bothers you."
3,Not as satisfied as others...,"Cons:1. Answering Machine is totally seperate from the system.Even you need to setup time and date twice on base. Once for Answering and once for Base callerID.2. Did not find any way to check answering mailboxes through handsets.3. Handsets (and also Base) do not share Phonebooks.4. Cannot use phonebook while on a call. It's good to dial a stored number when using phone cards.5. While listening to left messages, CallerID does not show caller's info (again because answering system is totally a seperate unit.Pros:(Compred to a comparable Panasonic)1. Has Vibra Alert2.(Probably) Clear Noise-less voice. (My old 2.4 Panasonic had a lot of noise when on a call).3. Has a battery compartment for the base too."
3,User interface flaws,"This phone works perfectly, good sound and features. However, the user interface design is poor:1. Menu based access on the phone and base is cumberson and not well designed. I can only wish for the much superior Sony design.2. The Handsets and base do not share a phone book.3. The Handsets cannot access the answering machine on the base."
2,Missing a major feature,"I bought this phone because it seemed to have everything at a great price. I've had it for 2 weeks now, and I've noticed some major flaws:1. The phone DOES NOT HAVE speed dial! This is the feature I use most often when making international calls. I can't believe Motorola didn't provide a basic feature like this one.2. The person on the other end cannot hear me on occasion for a few seconds - and I'm less than 10 feet from the base.3. The buttons are really small and hard to press.On the positive side, the phone looks cool and has a lot of other cool features. Motorola just didn't get the basics right with this one."
2,Don't buy 5.8 GHz if you live in a stucco house.,"I was impressed with this phone until I walked outside the house 20 feet away from the base unit and lost connectivity. I called Motorola and they said it is due to the stucco environment. It would have been nice to know this before I bought the phone. There are other stuctural components that also interfer with the phone's range, so I would check with Motorola on limitations before buying."
3,Watch out for rebate...,"The phone performs well. Minor peeve - does not come with battery for base. Phone book entries do not update from handset to base or vice-verse. Caller ID # of new calls count has to be cleared from both handset and base - does not clear automatically from one (base/or handset) if you answer call on the other.Rebate - Severely disappointing - I purchased phone 6/3/05 - Received ""rebate processed"" confirmation email on 7/19/05 which said I would get my check within 8 weeks. Called today (8 weeks later) and they said they extended the process time on rebate and they would MAIL my check on 10/17!!!! Apart from the inconvenience of me having to check on this, this seems pretty unethical and I am checking into the legality of it."
2,Poor Outgoing Message Quality,"I received this as a gift and am very disappointed with the quality of the outgoing answering machine message. While everyone dislikes the sound of their own voice, this recording microphone is so substandard, that my voice sounds like I'm transmitting from the bottom of the ocean.The controls are very cumbersome as well. One has to push through 5 menu buttons to reset the call counter.I'm returning this one."
3,Product is not good just customer serive is good!!,"I bought it about a month ago & just started use it 2 weeks ago. The battery charger never lights on eventhough it's fully charged. Couple days ago, a straight line underneath the number came out which spilt the number(eg. 8 becomes two '0')which annoyed so much.I called the customer service,& agreed to help me replace a new phone. Hope the other set works good....I got the good price on the phone that's why it's worth to give a try this item."
1,UGH!,"Digital display on main handset failed after only a few months use. Also, graphic interface for the features is not very good. I expected a lot more from Motorola."
3,Motorola speakerphone/answer machine,This product looks nice however; it is not as easily used as other cordless phones. The User's Guide (which had another model description on the cover)was not as helpful as it could have been. I contacted Motorola and was advised the same User's Guide is for both the model printed on the cover and the model that I had purchased even tho there are some differences in the two.
1,bad manufacturer,"bad battery, it's broken after 1 week, have to keep charging it all the time! don't buy! junk! it's not manufactured by motorola."
2,Try to find Expandable MD681,"After reading all the reviews, I hope I will like the phone. I really wanted an expandable phone system, unfortunately, not like other brands, you have to buy an extra for the MD681. Target doesn't carry it, Good Guys and Office Depot doesn't have it either. Good Guys and Office Depot personal didn't even know that this phone exist. Anyway. It would be helpful if anybody could tell me where I can buy an extention. You can e-mail me @:TinyTreasures7@msn.com. Thank you so much."
1,delayed shipment,"I did not use standard free shipment and paid about $7, however, it took longer than my previous orders! I did not appreciate the value of paying extra shipping."
2,dissapointed,i bought this unit and was very pleased until i had a problem.<br />my dog broke the power pack and motorola said i cant get a replacement part. i thought why cant i buy another power pack. motorola said they do not sell replacement parts so my phone is no good now.<br />i bought a uniden cheaper and it actually sounds better then the motorola. it was 1/3 the price
2,And to think I used to WORK for Motorola,"Overall it's really not such a bad phone, but it's quite uncomfortable to hold to my ear and next to impossible to hold between ear and shoulder. You NEED a headset if your conversations last more than a few short minutes.Then today I splashed water... not poured water, simply SPLASHED water on the handset and destroyed it. Motorola says ""if it's been damaged with ``liquid`` the warranty is voided."" Just for giggles I tried to repair it and was largely successful, once I got past all the moisture seals that ARE in place on the unit... there just aren't enough at all necessary areas. go figger... I'm buying a NON-Motorola replacement this weekend."
2,Dead After 18 Months,"Worked great for 18 months of very light use, then handset died. New battery was no help. Unimpressed with Motorola's long-term quality. Outside of the warranty period, so we'll see what they do..."
2,Product Limited,"We have found that this product has limited use in our home. We have to stay right near the main unit in order for the caller to hear us without static on the line. So it is as if we are on a cord phone in essence, due to the fact that we can not move around the room, much less go into another room in the house."
4,Very good phone,"I got it some days back and it works great, even it's wireless phone works for more than 30 meters, I tried yesterday. It's built is very good, handling is very good. I highly recommend it for everybody."
2,battery never charges,"I have plugged this device for last three weeks, but it never fully charges. The keypad is unusable and light is just too much behind the keypad."
1,Motorola MD681 5.8GHZ review,"I am extremely dissapointed with this phone, It does not work well! I live in a two story condo and the sound quality quickly breaks up if I go upstairs? My cheap 900mhz phone has triple the distance! I think that's the most important function not to mention the lack of synchronization between handset and base."
2,Motorola Cordless Problems,"This is my first Motorola product. I've always read good reviews, needed a new phone and purchased the MD681.The Pros were the design, comfort, style, and functions.The cons: Had problems with voice quality, not as good as my older Panasonic (it was the phone being replaced). However, it was something I would have lived with, but the answer machine picking up was a huge issue. The answer machine would pick-up randomly, sometimes yes and sometimes no. I returned the phone for a new one with the same issues. The technical support was a TOTAL joke!! Not only did the persons answer the support lines not understand the issue, but had no clue how to troubleshoot it. I asked for a Tier 2 support number and was given a number that was dis-connected!! Called back and was given a number to a adult only phone service!! This was/is by far the WORST customer support I've ever dealt with!!The phone goes back and I'll try the Panasonic."
3,"good features, buttons are not good","you need to practice and over time, you may be comfortable with the rubber buttons. they are crazy.. who would like a rubber button.. ? ohter than that, it is okay. but i will not buy this again! not comfortable to operate.. and you have to suffer everyday with that problem!"
5,A good phone for the money,"Great sound quality, volume control is better than previous phones (Sony, Panasonic). Nice features."
2,I wouldn't recommend this phone,"The first one I received didn't recharge when you set it back in the cradle, so I sent it back to Motorola and had to wait over a month to get a new one. The second one has a different problem, one which I also had with the first. While you are speaking, frequently the sound drops off and the person on the other end cannot hear you, even if you are standing still, near the base. It is extremely annoying. You also do not realize this is happening until the person on the other end lets you know they cannot hear you anymore. I have had this phone since last September and I'm going to replace it because of this problem.All of the other features on the phone work fine, but if callers cannot hear you, what good is it?"
3,Our opinion of the Motorola MD681,"We like the Motorola MD681 somewhat, but find the ""numbers"" much too small to use without extreme concentration. Also, it is not easy to pick up your caller ID description without pressing too many buttons. As a former Secretary at Ford Motor, I do not find this item customer-friendly.Actually, we are disappointed somewhat in this item and are upset that we have not received the $30 rebate promised to us.Thank you for giving us this opportunity to comment."
4,Pros and Cons identified after 1 year of usage,"Pros:1) The speaker on the handset is what impressed me the most. It is loud and clear. No one ever complained on the receiving end of the phone.2) Battery life has been great for me. I could talk with speaker phone on for hours before battery runs low. Without speaker on, it can standby for a few days.Cons:1) The speaker on the base is poor quality. My friends always complained they could not hear me well when I talk to the base.2) The phonebook entries can not accept a long enough number to accomodate CallingCardPhone#+CallingCard#+InternationalPhoneNumber. I can only save the first two and hand input the last one everytime I call.3) The keypad on the handset is not designed for ergonomical use. They could have been made easier for the finger tips.Overall, it is a great buy for the promo (...)! I paid three times that 1 year ago."
1,Save yourself the aggravation...,"I've had this phone for only a month and the handset is so static ridden and unreliable that it has become unusable. When I contacted the seller their response was, ""We did not get such complaint fronm other customers,"" and I was directed to contact Motorola. After navigating the perils and pitfalls of the Motorola warranty I have decided to simply purchase another phone and cut my losses before this experience costs me more than it already has. If you are looking for a shoddy (at best) product with little to no support from the seller or manufacturer then this is the phone for you. If, however, you are not excited about wasting your time and money then save yourself the aggravation and avoid this product."
5,Motorola phone,"Great buy. This is the best phone system we have ever owned.I recomend the Motorola phone system to anyone, especially if you have been having problems with your other phones. This one is great."
2,Poorly designed Anwering Machine!!!,"I've always bought Panasonic cordless phones but I thought I would give Motorola a shot. Let me say that it was a big mistake. The phone reception is okay with a slight hiss in the backround but the major disappointment is the answering machine. If the caller hangs up before they leave a message the answering machine doesn't hang up and stays recording, which basically sounds like an annoying busy signal and will stay that way until at least five minutes or until you pick up the receiver and turn it on and off. You shouldn't have to do this with todays technology and for a two hundred dollar phone this is unacceptable. I'm stuck with the phone because I paid too much for this. Don't let these reviews fool you here the answering machine definately has a major flaw."
3,Sub-par Phone Compared To Others in Same Category,"I am not sure if I agree w/ some of the reviews here. I would not be surprised if to hear that some of these reviews may have been give by people w/ an interest in Motorola.You see, I find this phone having some basic drawbacks compared to other phones in the same category:1) The handsets cannot access the answering machine to retrieve messages.2) The call id log does not tell you which calls may have left a message in the answering system.3) The caller id display does not match the name stored in your phone book to make a distinctive ring tone (so that you know which calls come from a friend/family).4) Phonebook entries cannot be shared among handsets and base."
2,Handset Loses Contact,"Good sturdy telephone for the two weeks we had it. However, handset would often shut off when you just laid it down on the table. It would restart if you removed and reinserted the battery cover. Obviously, we had to return it as defective."
1,Not Compatible with Verizon in NYC,"This purchase was a nightmare. I called Motorola 5x for support only have them blame Verizon of not providing a strong enough signal (bps- baud rate per second) for my caller ID feature to work. After retuning the phone (Amazon is great about this) I still had the same problem. The worse part is that there isn't enough information about this phone. Verizon must've thought I was crazy asking them to increase MY signal just because Motorola's phone required a higher signal yet this information does not appear anywhere.I used other phones with caller ID box and they workedI completely reset the phone.It is not worth the hassle. The phone is really cute and has great features, if they met the standard for all providers."
1,No Good,"I had this phone for 3 weeks and had to get rid of it, there is nothing good about it. If you walk more then 10 feet from the base theres static. If you want to call a # back from the caller ID theres about 5 steps you have to go tru. And the answering maching has to be one of the worst ever. There has to be better 5.8GHz phones out there"
4,Excellent but has its own flaws,"I have been using this phone system for last 2 weeks and should say am totally impressed by the simplicity and quality of the product. Voice quality on handset, handset speakerphone, base phone on normal phone calls as well as intercom is just too good. Before this Phone I had Sony cordless phone followed by a Panasonic 900 MHz and I must say this phone is far superior then the others.Some annoying features as mentioned by other reviewers also:a) Phone book has to be entered in each handset, base phone separately.b) If you pick up a call on one handset, the other handset and base phones show as new calls.c) Deleting a message from voice mail is a bit tricky and you can end up deleting all messages instead of a selected one.If you are ok with the above limitations then this phone is great."
4,"Good phone, good price","The reception is great, especially compared to my old 2.4Hz and 900 Hz phones. Sound is clear, too. The blue light that flashes when other phones are in use is a bit gaudy, but the overall looks is good. The handset seems a little stiff, perhaps too heavy handed on the ""looks"" side and light on ergonomics. But hey, after all, it's just a phone! I wish the answering machine were accessible from the handset, but that's minor. I wouldn't pay list price, (like I said, it's just a phone!) but at Amazon price, it's definitely worth it."
4,5 Years+ still works fine,"I have the base station and 3 remote phones. Live in a 2 bedroom 1200 sq foot apt. Immediately outside the apt is ok reception and transmission. Inside the reception and transmission is fine.Only static I've gotten has been from the phone line itself. I use Vonage and their internet phone. There is a large FM/AM radio broadcast repeater several hundred yards from my apt. Using a land line with Verizon the interference was pretty bad. 5.8GHz keeps me away from their frequencies. Lower frequencies don't.If the battery power gets low, the distance diminishes. I just switch phones. Buy your batteries from a reputable supply source. Too many small internet retailers sell expired batteries.I don't consider this unit as good as good as a wired phone, but such is the nature of wireless. I'm satisfied with it."
5,excellent product,"This is the best cordless system we have ever found. We have a wireless network system for our many computers and printers and this system has never interfered with the signal. All of the features are easy to understand and operate, a plus for us baby boomers who need our children just to program the TV! We have four remote handsets with the system and the range and clarity are great."
1,Worst phone ever.,The sound quality is barely acceptable and the pins that connect the phone to it's base for recharging break easily.
1,"A product that does not do any good for ""Motorola"" name",The phone died on me merely 18 months after buying !!!! Never ever in my life a cordless phone has performed so badly. Will not buy any more Motorola products and would suggest all to keep away from this phone atleast.
3,Eeh....no,"It appears Bradley and Sarjeant put the Sherlock Holmes canon under a microscope and conducted an exhaustive ten-year examination to find justification for their hypothesis that Holmes was, in fact, female. They point to a few other researchers who have--independently--come up with the same theory, but I'm still not convinced. And in the end, does it really matter if Sherlock was a woman? Or a man? Or even a female alien (sorry...watched Dr. Who the other night)? The stories are just as enjoyable no matter which stance you take. Let's not ruin it by overanalyzing. I'm a fan of Holmes myself, and it never ceases to amazes me that so much research has been published, refuted, supported, and endlessly debated. Some of these fanatics remind me of a cross between D&D fans and Trekkies."
1,Surprised to discover this was not a serious book,"I was looking forward to reading this book. And now I am very sorry I did. It was very disappointing and most of all for the rampant sexism of the authors. Perhaps I should not criticize. Perhaps I should cross my leg properly, slouch on furniture and have black monthly funks. Offensive. Not to mention the presenting/twisting of facts to suit their premise.Sebastian Moran? Really? I appreciate some speculation was needed as the Holmes Canon with its spotty and contradictory facts does present a challenge. However, the huge leaps in this book defy reason. I will be tossing this book away as I would be embarrassed to have someone think this book is my taste."
2,Could Not Hold My Interest,I have many books by this author but I found this one to be disappointing. It did not hold my interest and made a quick trip to my local library as a donation.
1,Cute idea but MICRO SIZED!!! (picture deceiving!),"I have a space pen that I bought at the Kennedy Space Center. I also bought several space pens as gifts while I was there. They truly are the best pens. So I was thrilled to see this neat pairing of the best pen with a great flashlight, the Maglite. I ordered one for us and sent one to my brother as a gift. Oh boy, was I disappointed when I opened ours! I felt EMBARRASSED that I had sent this micro-sized set to my big brother! The pen is about 3"" and the flashlight looks like something you hang on a keyring. Picture VERY deceiving. This is ok for a child's first space pen, but don't order this for an adult unless they are little people."
5,Thankyou!,Shipping was a little slower than another identical book that I bought (from another supplier). But very satisfied with product for the price paid.Thankyou!
1,buyer beware - high failure rate,Two of the three units at the store did not function. The 3rd worked only once after we brought it home. Tried everything - batteries - switch - cartridge - nothing worked. Must not be made very well in my opinion.
3,Broken Bear,"My daughter got this bear as a Christmas gift and absolutely loved it. Within a month the eyes and mouth stopped working but still reads the story. I contacted the MFG and they said I have to ship the bear back to them in order to get a replacement. I don't understand why I should be expected to pay for S&H on a product that lasted less than a month. They then suggested I take it back to the store where it was purchased, well it was a gift and we don't have the box it came in nor a receipt...how's that going to work? I've been so frustrated with the whole thing the poor bear has just been sitting on a shelf waiting patiently to be replaced. I'm very disappointed in this product. I grew up with Care Bears and adored them, I wanted the same for my daughter. It's just too bad that they don't make toys like they use to."
2,good except can't get the accessories!!!,"My [...] daughter loves this bear, but it only came with one book for [...]!! And now that the overpriced stories aren't included I've got to find the other ones, which is impossible! Nobody has them and this toy said it came out in 2005. Even when I do find them there are only 3 others and they are overpriced, I wish I would have seen that before I bought it!"
5,My favorite Hawaiian album,"This is Hapa's masterpiece of slack-key guitar music. Not only are the composition lovely and heart-felt, each piece is immaculately performed and artfully produced. Listen using quality earphones, and you're in heaven."
3,First purchase of Hapa,"I wanted to experience performances by Hapa and bought 3 CD's. There are no spectacular tracks on this CD, but the CD is enjoyable. The best tracks from this CD are also on ""Collection"" and ""Maui"" is more enjoyable for me."
3,An all right album to buy if...,"you're an ultimate Pulp fan. Some good songs, but this album isn't worth a penny compared to Seperations, His N' Hers and Different Class. The lyrics might not have changed too much over the years, but this collection of Pulp ""oldies"" is certainly not a musical master piece!"
