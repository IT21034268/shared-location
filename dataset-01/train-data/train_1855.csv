5,Violence is Golden,I happened upon this band by accident but they were a very worthwhile find. Very punk/new wave and very creative.
5,Card File,"This is an excellent little card file, holds many addresses neatly and orderly.Never misplace a important phone number or address again."
3,Rolodex Petite Open Tray,I am pleased with this product is very easy to use. and very easy to change out an address My other address book fell apart was the reason I purchased this one and so far it seems to be serving its purpose.
3,SoSo,"The rolodex is okay as long as it is not used alot. I bought and use mine for web sites and passwords, especially the ones I do not visit frequently. If it is used often then I THINK it will not last long. I chose this one because of price and not durability."
4,Video Card Shares with Physical RAM; USB Ports Tightly Spaced,"The only significant problem with this computer was that the video card was sharing memory with the physical memory (RAM). This meant that the notebook actually had only 192 MB RAM of the original 256 MB RAM remaining for physical memory use.The only minor problem I found in this computer was that the USB ports were spaced too closely to the round AC power jack. This would be important if you were trying to plug in a wide USB device, such as the iPod Shuffle or a variety of other MP3 stick players.Besides these two issues, the HP Pavilion ze4805us is a very quiet, reliable, and decent-performing computer with excellent value."
4,upgrade the ram,"Upgrade the ram. If you add a 256 stick, it will allow you to allocate 128 megs to video, and it actually runs cs well :)"
1,"Geared for tourist, not thru-hikers","I am thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail right now (today I'm resting in town and using a computer at a church). I started with this book and found that it did not work well for me on the AT. It has lots of stuff that just isn't needed by a thru-hiker which makes it sooooooo heavy and it is hard to follow. I switched to wingfoot's handbook, which is more condensed and to the point. I got criticized by some people who were using this one, but it's one of the best things I have done to make my thru-hike successful so far. I threw my companion away and haven't regretted it. Get a handbook!"
4,Not bad actually.,They are very comfortable and has a lot of pockets. Shipped very fast.The XL is good if your under 5'7.Tottally recommend it if you like vests and want to look like a ranger.
5,Great Shocks!,Great Shocks.I saved over $500 by changing these myself and not using Midas.My brother and I changed all 4 shocks in about 2 hours.
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this book hoping to get more in depth explanations to the answers to the problems in the main text book, but in the end get very little from it. For some, like me, calculus is a difficult subject and any extra help can go a long ways. This student solutions manual only includes answers to EVER OTHER ODD problem. Not every odd, not every other, only every other odd (i.e. 1, 5, 9, etc.) I find the ""hard"" problems in the main text are frequently NOT the ones the solutions manual shows. The few problems from each section that are actually covered do show most of the intermediate steps between the original problem and the final solution in the scope of the section/chapter. Also, there is no explanation on what is being done in each step; the solution from each major step is shown with no information about how that step (or solution) was achieved. In the end the price simply is not worth paying for only a very small subset of solutions."
2,Don't Bother,This manual has very few questions worked out. I find it much more helpful to my learning to check my answers in the back of the textbook and work them out again if they are wrong. Don't bother to buy this.
1,NOT I REPEAT NOT RECOMMENDED!!,"worst solutions manual i have ever ""used"". actually i could not even use this because every problem i was assigned in the class was not covered in this book. i am a parent and full time worker as well as full time student and i have limited time to get lab/teacher assistance and look to solution manuals to help clear any confusion i have on certain problems and this did not do that.if you can find instructors annotated edition, i recommend it."
2,"Calculus, Single Variable, Student Solutions Manual","I bought this Student Solutions Manual as your website suggested along with Calculus : Single Variable. The solution manual was the third edition while Calculus, Single Variable was the fourth edition. You need to correct your website because the solutions manual does not match the text book. I did return this book."
3,Doesn't have many problems,This book does an alright just at explaining how to work out solutions however it only just answers for every other odd problem. In hind sight I would have only bought the text book and just googled any problems I had questions on.
3,Calculus Solution Manual,"Overall experience with Amazon was great, as far as the shipping, purchasing, billing, etc.... everything went very well and the book showed up on time and in great condition. I wouldn't recommend buying it though, it's only got random solutions....I was hoping for all of the even solutions."
2,Ho Hum,Pretty average movie. Little known which is why I bought it. To have a look. I know now why it's little known. Weak story. Give it a miss.
1,Dog gone it!,"I found this a very difficult movie to watch.DogboysIt was bad (capital B), bad acting, bad story, bad dubbing ... you get the idea.I spent most of my time on the FF button hoping that the film would improve, but it didn't.I even made myself sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end without FF button, but to no avail, the film was just rotten, in my humble opinion."
4,X-Mal &#65533;ber alles,This was qiute a revelation. German post-punk gothic rock that was sung by the beautiful anja huwe. It was very very listenable and has aged quite well. The first album would be followed by a much better second one.
4,The carnivorous carnival,"In the begining of this book, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are in Count Olaf's car's trunk. Luckily, they escape. Then, they use the costumes to discuise themselves as freaks, to get into the evil Madame Lulu's carnival, were Olaf and his troupe are staying. Chabo the wolf baby (Sunny)and Beverly and Eliot, the 2 headed guys,(Violet & Klaus) are what Klaus, Sunny and Violet become. At the end, Colette the contortionist, Kevin the ambidexterous guy, and a hunchback guy whose name I forgot, are tricked into being Olaf's helpers. Even farther into the end, something truly sad happens, and I am so glad this is a series, and is not just the very sad end. I highly recommend this book, but I've read other books in the series that are better, so I gave this 4 stars."
2,incomplete guide to beekeeping,"this is a good book for someone interested in beekeeping, but offers little to someone who is actually getting started in beekeeping. It contains an introduction to nearly every important topic in beekeeping, but is not in depth enough to help anyone who has bees and has questions about them."
2,odd movies,odd movies not great films or classics most likely will be forgotten or those that see them will wish they could forget movies
5,Awesome!,I used to watch this show as a young child. It does bring back good memories. Cartoons now adays are not like what they used to be.
4,not bad,This is a pretty good video. It's comes across as more like a pilot for a travel show than an actual documentary. But the production quality is pretty impressive for what I would guess is a pretty small budget. I kinda wish the old lady didn't do any narrating; her voice was a bit harsh on the ears...
2,NOT dishwasher safe!,"Overall, the quality of this product is reasonably good for the price you pay, and the non-slip handle is comfortable in my medium-size hands. The problem I have is that the product description deceptively says it is dishwasher safe, and that is the primary reason I bought it. However, when I received it the package clearly states that it should not be placed in a dishwasher, and there is a sticker on the handle with the same warning. Buy this if you want a decent tenderizer at a low price, but know that you will have to wash it by hand."
4,Serves Purpose,"Before this, I was using a soup can to tenderize my meats. This is obviously a step up in class, but does the same purpose. A side note: I don't believe this should be washed in a dishwasher. It looks like it might rust."
1,Not Diswasher Safe,This Meat Hammer can not be put in the diswasher and thus can not be sanitized!....False information provided. Unsafe item.
5,useful,This is a meat hammer. It smashes meat. We used it for chicken breasts and it worked well. I don't think there is much else to say besides that- the quality is good
2,There are better books,"Baierlein is chatty and presents the material in a friendly manner, however too often the material is simply glossed over and the results presented in a purely qualitative manner.In particular, his development of the early quantum theory has gaps in it, or rather, it is presented in a convoluted manner that does more harm than good.Also, the last chapter, on critical phemonena covers a difficult subject in a totally unacceptable manner."
4,Easily Readable,I had trouble with a quantum book last year due to lacking any real examples. But this book is very nice in providing those examples. Some of the questions in each chapter start to diverge from the book some requiring either to look up values online or to have prior knowledge to something relating to this subject that even a major like myself lacked.
3,Thermal Physics review,Book has fairly good qualitative descriptions. However the books description and work regarding analytically problem solving is minimal at best. Good for courses that focus on qualitative but bad for courses focusing on the analytic.
2,school,"I hate school, but this book helped me out a bit. Thanks for getting me threw another class this semester."
3,Nearly 100 Years of Divas,"Seventy essays on colorful female performers who have titillated the public fancy since 1915. James Parrish covers such a broad range of ladies that one finds Jeanette MacDonald sandwiched alphabetically between Jennifer Lopez and Madonna, while Demi Moore is flanked by camp queens Maria Montez and Mae Murray. You may be miffed that some of your favorites didn't make the cut, but there is plenty of dishy gossip to make up for your disappointment."
2,Useless by today's standards,"Things that are written in this book can nowadays be easily found on wikipedia or other main sites, and they're most of all very superficial and not terribly reliable. Plus, what have Whitney Houston and Britney Spears to do in a book about Hollywood?? Whitney was in two movies, and Britney in one. That hardly makes them actresses, let alone Hollywood people..."
5,"Good and Fabulous -- no ""Bad"" here","James Robert Parish, the author of The RKO Gals and The Fox Girls, has now written a witty and remarkably informative new book about 70 major ""Divas"" of the entertainment world. The most surprising thing about this book is that it contains not only current idols like Madonna and Jennifer Lopez, and perennial idols like Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland, but also some rather obscure (in terms of early 21sts century) idols, including Kay Francis, Mae Murray, and Greer Garson. Yes, this book covers the whole gamut, from Theda Bara to Britney Spears. The quotes are fantastic, the photos are great, and the information is fabulous. Highly recommended."
3,Good book,"Not an awesome book, but a good book about the Didjeridu, and one of the few available.Any didj' enthusiast ought to have it on his shelf though."
1,A Review,"Here is my review on this product. I am sure it would have been a great product but I never received it. When I order, it told me that it will be at the address, I provided in a couple of days to a week. I never received the product. So I would like my money back for this product. Thanks."
2,Disappointing,"I am disappointed with this version in comparison with the older version by the same name that I have on casette tape. To my ear, the older version (no longer available) is much more lively and sounds much more like Bach and the Beatles. This recording also has some production querks, such as overemphasis on the base from a modern piano that seems unlike Bach and low level garble in a few spots. I am not a trained musician, so others who are may have different opinions."
2,"Worth a try, but don't expect much","I like listening to experimental music, and thus I have a lot of respect for this album for what it attempts to accomplish. I had high expectations for this experiment because I am a huge fan of Bach and the Beatles. It's very hard to hear any Beatles influence during most of the album. Unless the money that you plan to spend on this album is disposable, I suggest that you consider spending some time listening to the samples before investing in this album."
2,Too Much Bach,"I purchased this CD because I like Beatles music. This is not one of the most rewarding covers. After one or two cuts, the music begins to resemble bad recordings of lesser Bach works. Too much imitation Bach, not enough Beatles."
2,crapped out after 5 months,"After 5 months this unit has started giving me errors on blank DVDs after I record 1 track, which effectively means it doesn't work anymore.This is the second Panasonic DVD recorder I've owned. This first was the DMR E75V, which I bought about 3 years ago. Both of these units had good quality in the 4 hour mode - when they worked. It crapped out after 3 years and hundreds of discs, but was never 100%. It occasionally failed when finalizing the disc - about 5% of the time. It ultimately would not recognize the disc as the proper format, even though it was the proper disc. On the E75V Many of the discs I recorded from the 75 hung up also, maybe another 3%.So, it's Deja VU all over again. I'd hoped they would have improved on the design over the past 3 years, and because of the good recording quality, I decided to try it again. I got burned. I guess I'll try another manufacturer this time."
1,BEWARE!! Unit failed within one week out of the box,"BEWARE!! My Panasonic DMR-EZ17K has frozen with a new dvd inside and will not respond to any of the troubleshooting options in the manual. I've been using it for just a few days, and now it's useless. The display indicates that the unit is in a recovery process, however this just goes on and on for (hours)... the disc cannot be ejected and no other controls are functioning. I went throught the same options on the phone with Panasonic (at least they we're responsive) but without success. I don't think it's a disc issue because I managed to record several of the same discs (DVD-R) without any problem. It's going back in the box... what a pain!"
1,Unreliable,"I have had this for awhile. When it works, it works well, but they way they have the circuitry set up, it checks the disc before ejecting, which can make the player lockup and you can't get the disc out.I ended up throwing mine away and buying a different brand.Be forwarned, not a reliable product."
1,hate it,Does not respond to my remote. Does not respond to on/off switch. Does not play music CD. Does not work!!!Mine fail within a year.
1,AVOID THIS JUNK,"This thing stopped working right after the 1 year warranty expired. It doesn't recognize any discs anymore. The only discs it recognizes are the Panasonic DVD-RAM and its a 50/50 chance. If you try a different brand of DVD+RW, the formatting procedure will freeze up and destroy the discs and make them unusable. Looks like Panasonic fell into the junk category. I would avoid Panasonic and try another brand. Panasonic will have to find out the hard way that if you screw the consumers it will only hurt you in the long run."
2,Unreliable - fails to record pre-scheduled programs,"This is a great product in theory. The chasing playback is terrific (you watch the earlier part of a program and skip commercials while recording the later part).But the one I bought in Nov. '07 periodically fails to switch on to make pre-scheduled recordings. Half the time, the recording I scheduled never happens.The problem was rare at first, but became more frequent after the warranty ran out. Not all units may have this problem, but that's my experience, at least."
3,pretty good but loud,"After contacting Panasonic for the firmware update necessary to make the unit actually record (it seems that a factory refurb'd unit would have the factory update, but alas..) the unit records great. When I can find a DVD-RAM disk I'm eager to try the slip-time recording. I agree with several of the other reviewers: the unit has the loudest drive that I've ever heard in my life. I haven't yet tried the HD tuner: Panasonic tells me that my rabbit ears are too old for HD channels??"
5,Panasonic DVD Recorder,"An excellent product. Relatively easy to set up and very easy to use. This unit replaced a VCR, and we are very pleased with the result!"
2,Hangs. Had to return. Easy return.,The box would randomly quit responding to the remote control commands and I would have to pull the AC plug and re-plug to recover. Even the unit's on/off switch would not respond when the box was in this condition.Digital TV was fine. Recorder function was also fine. Just the hanging was too much.Amazon made the return very easy with even a UPS pickup at the house ! Full refund including return shipping.I will probably buy a HDTV through Amazon because of their excellent customer service and white glove delivery service.
2,Panasonic Recorder,"I purchases this recorder and had it for about 1 month before I had to return it. I returned it because the DVDs would get stuck in the recorder and not open for several minutes.Also the open/close buttons were slow to operate. You hit the open button wait several seconds before the DVD would open.Finally, I own a Panasonic DVD Player also and it would turn on whenever I turned on the Panasonic DVD Recorder. The remote codes are the same for power.What I LikedThe remote control is nicely designed.Ability to watch a program which is being recorded at the same time.Good quality recordings."
2,Help!!!,Ive seen some reviews on this and its all on the recording and tuner. I havent tried recording yet but the Tuner makes my analog Cable excellent even with just the Tv turned on and not the dvd recorder. However my problem is with playing DVDs. None of mine play. It says cant read disc. These are computer made as well as store bought. Any one have this problem and is there something I missed I need to hit. Honestly my 40 buck dvd players play everything no problem. Why do higher end ones always have problems playing all types of dvds? Thanks
3,"Trust Us, We're Experts","Half the story is missing. Where's the inside story of the junk science funded and propigated by those on the left. Examples are numerous but include the phoney Alar (apples) scare, funded by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Poisonous Plastics (PVC/Chlorine)funded by a coalition called Health Care Without Harm which was a front organization for Greenpeace and included more mainstream organizations which admitted they had been duped including Consumers Union, Catholic Healthcare West, and the American Nurses Association. It's time to tell the whole story."
5,finally!,"There isn't enough that I can say about this book so all I'll say is read this book. Get enraged by what this book has to say and then read Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael LEvine so you can learn how good PR is supposed to be. Trust Us, We're Experts tells us everything we thought we knew but didn't have proof for."
2,Treasure sign listing,"A rather simplistic hodge-podge of symbols supposedly denoting the ways to treasure sites as well as various other activities. Some signs appear to be from Native American petroglyphs intermingled with the Spanish route signs listed. I think there are some from much more recent origins such as scout visitors earning their woodsmen awards. This booklet is a primitive introduction to the subject and if you have nothing, it may be a start. For what you get, it seems way over-priced."
4,Good Cd. Buy it.,Short review. Very Good songs - great for those already with the adiemus albums will like too cause of the new tracks. Very good cd.
1,Look great...just don't wear them!,Gloves ripped first time my son wore them...within minutes to be exact. Very disappointing because they look so great and are very warm.
3,A matter of taste,"I enjoyed several records that Jan Garbarek played on in the 70s (especially Ralph Towner's ""Solstice""), but hadn't checked out anything he'd done for years when I picked up this CD several years ago. It's not a bad CD, but I can't recommend it as highly as other reviewers have done. It's a bit too meditative and New-Agey for me. I've always liked Garbarek best when he played with people who brought him out of his meditative default mode. Check out the Ralph Towner CD mentioned above. (I've also heard that his 1983 album ""Wayfarer,"" with Bill Frisell on guitar and Michael DiPasqua on drums, is a bit livelier than his usual stuff, but I haven't heard it yet.)"
3,Three quarters full,"3 1/2Another powerfully relaxed outing for this sensitive player, TM is mostly solid with the occasional atmospheric indulgence."
4,Rolodex,"For the money a great item to store business cards, etc. Advertised as slightly damaged which turned out to be a small piece cracked off the corner of the lid, hardly noticeable.."
2,"Cheap, cheap, cheap.","I use a Rolodex as a back-up, and also for information I wouldn't want made public if my BlackBerry was lost or stolen. My old Rolodex was over 20 years old and still performing when it was damaged during a move. This looked like a good replacement, but it's an example of the crap coming out of China. The paper cards are not even half the thickness of the previous ones. In less than a year, they are already wrinkled. The mechanism for opening and closing the lid is also cheaply made. The only improvement over the old model is the alphabet dividers, which are plastic and more durable than the previous paper ones. I paid for the Rolodex name (and inherent quality), but I didn't get it. If I hadn't left it in the box for three months before setting it up, I would have returned it."
5,Great CD!,"Just love this CD! I got hooked on Nina Simone when I saw the movie, Point of No Return. My fav tracks are Feeling Good, Don't Let me Be Misunderstood and I Want Some Sugar In My Bowl."
3,Simone,"I heard the song ""Sinnerman"" on a movie soundtrack, so I purchased this ""Best Of"" hoping to find more like it. While it was deccent, nothing special."
5,Perfect,"This little guy is perfect for an already crowded desk. I don't need a monster Rolodex and this one fits the bill. Small enough to stay out of the way but big enough to do the job. And as expected, as a ""Rolodex"" product, it is well made."
3,Okay but cards too small,"My own fault. I should have measured better and taken into consideration the card area had a hole in the bottom. I wanted one with a top to keep the dust out. But these cards are, for my purposes anyway, much too small to write anything much on them besides the briefest info.Again, my fault."
2,file box,the file box is small enough to be placed in a drawer but large enough to hold what I need. I have enjoyed using this because it stays open to the card I am using. Thank you.
3,Disappointing and rushed interpretation,"Listening to this CD makes me think that David Sanger was late to catch a plane when he sat down at the organ to record these symphonies. Rather than explore the nuances of the works, he marches briskly through in as no-nonsense a manner as he can muster.The result is not necessarily offensive to the ears, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I compared the timing of the 3rd Symphony to another recording I have, and Sanger's rendition is about 4 minutes faster...quite a bit, considering that the work is only about 30 minutes in length.The sound quality is adequete enough, but not enough to overcome the apparent indifference Sanger has towards these works."
1,silk and strings : taiwan,"A REVIEWER FROM FREMONT CALIFORNIA this video is with high price low guality and too short ( only 26 minutes), the content is very poor about taiwanese music and art, this video is not recommened to anyone who wants to understand taiwan"
5,It's a welcome addition,"Sam's ""Teach Yourself Object Oriented Programming"" is a welcome addition to your Java arsenal. Whenever I've started a new language in the past, I would start with a Sam's book for an overview on the subject, followed by a Wrox series book to get more depth, followed by an ""Unleashed"" or ""Professional"" book.This Sam's book is more than an overview. It teaches the full scope of OOP which is what Java is all about. If you need a solid foundation in Java, Sam's Teach Yourself OOP is the way to go."
1,Sams Teach Yourself Object Oriented Programming in 21 Days,"Though not a professional programmer I have been programming for about 15 years working my way up the Basic ladder to currently Vba. I can see the benefits of OO programming as I deal with complex business problems. This book seemed a good choice and I started the 21 day journey with great optimism. Day 1 was as you would expect, very basic using very simple analogies and situations. Day 2 seemes to start at a higher level like there are some pages missing and Day 3 makes such a giant leap that I had to return to Day 1 and start again. I repeated this loop about 10 times without any success at all. I have all my life been a ""Book Learner"" but this one has me beat. All-in-all a total waste of money."
5,Excellent,Great movie. The story line was great. Danny Kaye played all his roles as if they were the only role he played in the movie.
5,Beautiful Dreamer,"Like Steven Foster's folk song, which Virginia Mayo tinkles on the piano, this film is simple but perfect, i.e. simply perfect.It's laughable and lovable, thrilling and romantic. Danny and Virginia are a dream team, this one being their best collaboration. This movie has been a life's companion to me, since I saw it at the age of four or five."
4,A Danny Kaye great!,"This movie along with Five Pennies are two great films from the classic Danny Kaye. He does a wonderful job acting out this classic short story. The usual slap-stick with the sincerity of the role of Walter Mitty makes Kaye the perfect actor. I have seen other versions acted of this story, but none compare to that of Danny Kaye. The story gives it a four star rating, it is not as deep a role as that in Five Pennies, but still good. If you do not have Five Pennies, get it also. I feel it is one of his best, but this is a good one also."
4,One of Danny Kaye's Best!,"James Thurber apparently didn't like film version of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, but I do, so there! Granted, not much of Thurber's brilliant story made it onscreen (hey, let's see YOU try to adapt a ten page short story into a feature film), but the end result is a superb showcase for Kaye's seemingly infinite talents. Boris Karloff is also excellent as an evil psychiatrist in a performance that allows him to display his rarely seen comic abilities."
3,Just A Trip Down Memory Lane,"Purchased this so my husband could see it; I am always saying, ""Oh, they are just a Walter Mitty!"" He had no idea what I meant. NOW HE DOES. If Danny would have done less of his singing in this movie, it would have been better. I felt that got silly (even when I was a child and saw it the first time, I felt that way). The story is a good one and the acting in the movie is good too.The VHS tape arrived so quickly, I couldn't believe it! Excellent condition too."
1,The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,"The movie will not track and the quality is so poor it is not useful for it's intended purposes. Guess we should not have bought cheap, but rather a DVD the first time!"
1,Do a lot of research.....,"I recently saw on an Investigative Consumer Report on my local news some disturbing news on these products. Multiple pets had to either get surgery or even passed away in result of improper digestion of this product. When the company was asked to comment, they declined, then issued a statement, implying that the pet's illnesses/death were a result of the owner not using the product correctly. But a Vet that treated one of the cases, says it was due to the product itself. They do not break down in the animal's digestive tract as easily as the package leads on. In some animals, it causes a blockage, which results in infection, sometimes leading to death.If you want to find out more about this consumer report, you can find it on http://www.kirotv.com/consumer/5325021/detail.html"
1,Greenies,"I feel I was misled. Apparently there was some controversy over the safe digestion of the original formula of Greenies that I was told led to a recall of the old product and a new formula product was placed on the market. I made a sizable purchase and it appears as though the product shipped to me were possibly the last of the original stock of Greenies. None of the order I received is the new product. I live in Mexico and the order was placed to coincide with my trip to California during the holidays so I could bring them back with me to Mexico. There wasn't enough time to complain, return the shipment and receive a replacement order. While I was able to purchase in the market a few packages of the new formula product, I am now stuck with a large order of the original Greenies with questionable safety in feeding to my dogs."
5,How'd a White Boy Get The Blues?,"Music fan from Flushing,NY is an idiot. This album smokes and maybe music fan should do that before listening to it again. Popa Chubby is GOOD!! for your mind and soul, not to mention your feet."
1,40 days and 40 nights of unpleasantness,"First you have to go through two 5 gallon bottles of water to get rid of the rubber taste only to be rewarded with a product that starts screaming every time it runs (and it runs a lot!!). I'm told the compressor is going, but they don't seem to care that I can't fill two glasses of water at a time - it only dispenses about 1.5 glasses! It just stops and won't give you anymore until it 'runs' which takes about 5 minutes. Not real handy. I feel like a complete chump for buying the product -- high price/low quality. J&R won't work with the manufacturer and the manufacturer says they will replace it ""when they have it in stock again in about 1 month, but unplug the one you have and put it away"". The water dispenses VERY slowly. Not ideal for a family on the go!"
1,Bad Product / Bad Company,"For the two weeks that the unit worked, it seemed like a great product, although very noisy. Then it started to just shutdown for no apparent reason, and then it started to leak.I have been trying for 9 months to have it replaced. You can never get someone on the support and they never call you back. Email is the only option and I get the run around. I've sent letters and they keep stating that the product is on back order and excuse after excuse. If you buy it, you'd better hope you don't have to return it."
1,Worst Icemaker/Company,"I would rate this -10 if I could. We bought the IceMan in January 2006 only for it to stop working a few months later. We followed all of the instructions. We did everything the directions said. It still did not work. We contacted Windchaser only to be given excuse after excuse. It has now been 8 months of waiting for a replacement product. According to Windchaser, it will be another 6 weeks. Do not waste your money."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM,"I bought the Ultimate IceMan and have had two machines so far. Neither machine has worked. I have had the same problems I read in the reviews - incredibly slow dispensing of water, horrible noise that sounds like gears grinding, no water coming out. My machines have been returned for a total of 8 months. The most recent machine has been in their shop for two months and I can't get a callback from anyone. They keep promising to call, but never do. EVEN THEIR OWN STAFF ADMIT THE MACHINE DOESN'T WORK! I am out over $500 and I am NOT HAPPY. Wind Chaser - get your stuff together!"
4,"Work's Nice,, Look's Great","Work's Nice,, Look's GreatGood for the task, found my self having to buy 4 more refill packages to fill this to a level that would hold all my cards and still have plenty more room for future business cards. Does not come with enough card holders IMO.Quality is there, I do expect this to last a life time for me and will hold up to the daily use I put it through. Do wonder if a covered unit might not have been better? only to keep the dust off of it.Buy this with confidence.RagenRat"
3,Pricey but effective,The rolodex holds the cards really well even if you turn the search wheel at a faster rate. The base is strong and allows for the structure to remain well planted as you flip your cards. The card sleeves are made of good quality material.The question is ; is this is just not worth 31 dollars ? After spending 1 hour and 45 minutes with a service support center in the Philippines trying to solve software problems with my Palm Treo 700 ( without success) my answer is yes.
4,Handy card organizer,This was one of the cheaper Rolodexes I've found to date- I would have given five stars but turning the wheel is not as easy/smooth as I would have liked.
1,"Waste of paper, both book and currency","The PR for Mafia Marriage isn't accurate -- the authors did not give a deep look inside the Mafia in any respect. Bonanno seems to have very shallow values, and never comprehends, apparently, that both her own family and her husband's family were engaged in real crime. Every arrest (and there were several) caught her by surprise; the FBI agents parked outside her house were embarrassing, and she was proudest of her cooking accomplishments, the knack of feeding a dozen last-minute Mafia figures. And yet, she never wondered where the money came from, or really, why there were so frequently armed bodyguards around.Mafia Princess seems to be better: at least the author understands that the family business is crime."
4,How did America achieve her Greatness!,"Russell Kirk explains how 4 major cities played a major role in the founding of America. Russell takes the reader to Jerusalem for America's moral frame work; to Athens for her philosophical makeup; to Rome for her legal frame-work; to London to establish her progenitors.Not an easy read; but very rewarding in understanding and appreciating our Founding Fathers as they looked way back into history; as they pondered, debated, prayed and depended on the wisdom of God to help them create a new country and a new Constitution, built on the framework of these marvelous 4 major cities that played such a significant role in history past! Anybody who would like to know more about America's soul and what she stands for, as the founders intended, should read this book...that is my humble opinion."
2,An introduction for the high school upperclassman.,"The hype on the dust jacket refers to Kirk as widely learned, but when the historian turns in this survey of the West to the pages covering matters on which he himself is expert, he finds errors galore. It may be true that this book is a good introduction, but it should be understood not to be for the educated. In short, Kirk's failure to find success in academia was not related to his political views, but to his rather shallow grasp of his field -- history."
3,"Nice concept, but shoddy keyboard","I purchased twelve of these and two have failed outright in 4 months. Failure is in the keys, which don't register the correct values. The USB feature works well, but overall the product is not a good value. On the plus side, Matias did replace the failed items promptly and without fuss."
2,SW Not compatible with Vista 64 bit,I really wonder if I will ever get this thing up and running. Pro tolls LE is not compatible with Windows Vista 64 bit version. The company does not even mention if it plans any upgrade. I think the solution could be install Widows XP as a second operating system on your PC.
4,No Complaints,This product has worked just how i thought it would. I'm quite satisfied wiht my perchase.
3,Mbox,"Bought it as a gift, not for personal use.So that's what I've heard. Not my own opinion.Arrived well."
3,Just okay,"I love soup, and I am a vegetarian. This winter I was looking for some new recipes to try out and I thought I would give this book a go. I have tried at least 20 recipes and none were anything I would bother to make again. The food is all just okay. It isn't bad, it just isn't that good. I wouldn't waste the money on this book."
5,Deborah madison a genius!,"Making soup is actually a spiritual activity for me. I once brought a friend who had suffered a tragedy out of hysteria with a pot of chicken soup. It sent her back to her mother's Brazilian kitchen. Ever since, I have had a deep respect for 'slow food' and serious attention to the kitchen.This book has been a mainstay in my culinary library. Deborah's keen attention to detail and deep understanding of vegetarian cuisine produced a wealth of soups. Among my favorites are the Senegalese peanut butter soup, the passato, the tomato and red pepper soup with the little nests. Every soup I have made from this book has turned out well. And I have served up dozens of delicious and satisfying soups and am not yet half way through the book!I constantly receive appreciative comments. Even better, my friends have started making soup! And taking soup over to families with new babies has become a custom in my community."
2,Caution,"The layout of this book is terrible. The recipes don't start at the top of the page. Rather, they run onto the pages... in a jumbled mess. It takes away from this cookbook significantly. Why did they print it this way? To save on paper, printing costs? Whatever the reason, we the buyers have to turn the pages just to get the whole recipe... inconvenient. There are other great vegetarian books on soups... that are much better to cook from."
4,Vegetable Soups from Deborah Madison's Kitchen.,"Very nicely illustrated and laid out however for anyone in smaller towns some of the ingredients may not be available. It would be helpful to give a directory of the more unusual ingredients,a description of them and perhaps a buying guide."
4,"vegetable, not necessarily vegetarian","for perspective purposes, i'll start by mentioning that i'm an avid vegan cook. i received this book as a gift, and i will use it mostly for inspiration. this book is best for people who want to eat more healthy, nutrient rich vegetable soups. i wouldn't consider it in the vegetarian category, because fish and chicken broth are included in some recipes. deborah says in her introduction that she cooks a chicken once in a while and will make stock from it, which a seasoned vegetarian would not do. so, if you are looking for strict vegetarian recipes, look for something else. if you want to eat more veggies, or if you are already experienced in the kitchen and can edit recipes easily, this book has a lot of interesting flavor ideas. deborah also gives a lot of insight about the structure of soups, like: which veggies are good for stock and which aren't, how and when to add texture, and how to get the best flavors out of your ingredients."
5,wonderful soup recipes,"The first copy of this cookbook I purchased, I left for our daughter, who is a vegetarian, when we moved. After two weeks without it, I purchased my own copy. We are omnivores, but we love the healthy recipes in this book. The soups are often better the next day (for example, the lentil soup). I recommend the book enthusiastically."
1,Book fallening apart.,"The book was advertise used. This book was falling apart. When you would turn the pages they would fall about the binding was coming apart, 95% of the book had writing in it. I just throw it out,it wasn't worth sending back. Plus,it also looked as if was kept in a damp place."
4,"Nice weight, feel and design - we'll see about 18/0...","Purchased as a gift for my daughter, this set has a very nice weight, feel and design. However it is an 18/0 (18% cromium and 0 nickle), so I'll have to update if there is an issue with staining or corrosion."
4,nice upgrade,great look & feel ! very nice everyday kind of service . the photo does not do justice to this set. supper high gloss finish . real cool design .would get 5 stars if it contained nickel. no problems in the dishwasher.
4,Paper Air Plane Book,Very cool book. There are multiple pages for the same airplane so if you mess up - you can always try again. My son and I are enjoying the different planes.
4,Paper Airplane book,"Arrived on time, except too advanced for my nine year old grandson at this time. Will hold it for later gift. Will start him on a simpler book and build up to this one. I love the plane sheets ain the back. A fine quality book, just not for a young aged person.Do think an adult would have to explain and work with a child to understand this book and my son will be out of town for a few weeks. This will hopefully be great for a later time."
5,Great Craft book for kids!,Great step by step book that helps children create paper airplanes. Punch out parts to create airplanes are included. Creative fun! Such a wonderful alternative to electronics!
3,Paper Air plane Book,"Fast delivery. Book delivered in pristine condition. Dislike the paper plane cutouts in the last half of the book. Otherwise, okay."
2,"A colorful but simple book,","This book has everything that makes a great airplane book except the airplanes. The designs are simple, most of these planes can be learned in any school room. At least one, one of the more clever designs, was previously published in the International Papar Airplane Book, which I feel is a much superior book. This book is more fitting for very young paper pilots with its simple designs and colorful tearouts. The explanation of flight on the author's web page is the best thing about the book and its not even in the book! The only thing this book has going for it is the World Record plane and the story about breaking the record. I felt the folding intructions for this plane were incomplete."
5,better than recycling,"I have too much scrap paper. I was going to throw it out, but at the last moment I decided instead to buy The World Record Paper Airplane Book. Taking a sheet of scrap off the pile, I was able in a minute or two to make an Interceptor, which when launched sailed across the room and slid behind the bookcase. Scrap problem solved. I also discovered that if you make The Hornet with an extra fin in the back it boomerangs back to you when you throw it. Good times."
5,Whinging Americans,"This is a fine Aphex singles collection originally released in Australia and Japan for AFX's January 1997 tour - Warp didn't have much distribution in Australia at the time and this disc served as an intro to many Australian/ Japanese tech fans.The singles included were very hard to find in Oz at the time,and for that reason this disc was great. Also note the price at the time was AUS$20 ( US $12).So why complain 8 years later that this is an overpriced rip-off?It is what it is- 4 top Aphex singles. Also [...]didn't exist at the time for Warp Records Downloads, and buying the four singles (re-releases)seperately will cost similar, and only net you a couple of extra tracks.Its also means you can listen to a full albums' worth of tunes rather than play the singles back to back.Anyway - Donkey Rhubarb, Ventolin , On and Icct Hedral are worth the price, and for most fans, this disc is an easy way to find said tracksMick James"
4,51/13 --> length of record 51 min 13 sec,"It was I who wrote the ""Bulldozer..."" review a few months back and now I've returned to answer a question I found a couple of reviews below mine : the one about the ending of Ventolin [Marazanvose Mix Edit]. On the Ventolin Ep cd it says ""Everything by Richard D. James except laughing by mum on track 2""."
4,Aphex Twin 51/13,"This CD contains some ""great hits"" by Richard D. James aka Aphex Twin. The music on the CD is from several tunes he have composed, but mostly they are re-mixed tunes of tracks like On, Donkey Rhubard, and Ventolin. The Ventolin remixes are very good, like always when Richard do something. I still missing tracks like Hangable Auto Bulb, Xtal, and more. So it's more a remix cd of the very good ""Ventolin"".... Overall I really recommend this CD for the real collector of Richard's music."
4,its quite good but it smells like wanting to make money,"thanks to this cd i could get many tracks i wouldnt have found any other way... and this is aphex's material, so there is very good music in here, a bit disconnected though. From the begining, till the philip glass orchestated Icct hedral, this cd comes to be tremendous, beautiful and with lots of energy, ambient and melody all together as only richard knows to assemble.. after that, the last three ventolin remixes show very little music and more a bit of humor and electric tricks, which i like, but may dissapoint a first time listener, this is why i would recomend other rdj albums to begin, but for aphex's lovers of course very recomendable.To conclude:great... very great album till the 8th track, and nice extrange material for the joy of fans till then on.I only didn like the horrible smell of money for warp behind this."
4,A motley Aphex assortment,"RDJ here shuffles a bunch of tracks together from the Ventolin, On, and Donkey Rhubarb EPs into something rather tastey. Horay!There's not really much I can say on it's behalf, beyond the standard ""if ya likes Aphex, get it! cuz there ain't any other way yer gonna find these..."" It's much cheaper than trying to hunt down the singles, usually. Most of the Donkey Rhubarb EP is on here, and that is one of my favorite RDJ works, it's really fun. The Ventolin remixes are bizarre, even for RDJ. They aren't even related in mood. The end of the Marazenvose mix is hilarious. I don't want to hazard a guess as to what those voices originally were..."
4,rare aphex collected! an idm lover's dream.,"finally some of james' rarer works from his hard to find uk singles are collected here. included is most of the american version of the 'on' single, most of the uk 'donkey rhubarb' single and a couple of the remixes of the uk 'ventolin' singles. although the 'ventolin' singles do at times wear thin (with the exception of remixes by the likes of chris jeffs (cylob) and luke vibert (wagon christ)), the brilliance of the album is contained in the rare beauties: 'on', 'donkey rhubarb' and the breathtakingly melodic 'pancake lizard'. also, in a breakthrough arrangement, conductor phillip glass does his take on one of aphex twin's classic tracks: 'icct hedral'. all in all, if you are a fan of idm, then this cd, though a bit expensive, is well worth your time and money."
3,Good Advice,"Although self-consciously and unapologetically Roman Catholic, Father Sweetser offers a theologically sound vision of covenantal relationships that could help to form any Christian parish. His advice, based on more than 30 years of pastoral experience is not new, but it is practical. This program could reasonably be exercised in most congregations. Father Sweetser dares to address the taboo subjects of those whose Christianity is only marginally expressed and the various ways that the Church drives individuals to such isolation. Any bishop, priest, pastor, deacon, parish administrator or parish council president could benefit by reading this book."
2,Too Clinical,"This book was much too clinical for my taste. I'm a pregnant woman, not just a statistic or a patient. I want to know more than just the basic information, and I don't need to know the technical/medical/Latin phrases for everything (I found this really distracting while reading the book); just tell me in plain language what is going on. The book omitted a lot of information about the various things one can expect to happen during each trimester, and I could have done without the extensive lecture on genetics. The data that was presented seemed to be well-researched, but I just don't think it was presented in the most effective manner."
3,Not what I expected...,"The book was not the original 1974 copyright in pink hardcover as displayed on the site. It was a newer copyright version (2006), smaller in size and different cover displayed. I read through it and it has the reminiscence of what I remembered reading when I was little with pictures in like so I am satisfied with that although I truly wished I could have the original that I lost so many years ago."
3,Cinderella,"Cinderella is about a girl named Cinderella who had to live with her stepmother who hated her. Cinderella had two stepsisters who hated her also. Cinderella is forced to cook and clean for her family while they sit around all day and do what they want. One day a messenger arrives with an invitation to a ball, but Cinderella is told she can&#65533;t go. Her fairy godmother helps her out.It teaches that some dreams can come true and work out for you. I think the age level is around 6-8 years. I think this was a very interesting book and it never gets old no matter how many times you read it."
1,Cinderella,I didn't get the same book as pictured. The book pictured is the one my mom used to read me when I was little and it was my favorite. The book sent to me wasn't even close to what I thought I would be getting. The only reason I bought it was because I thought it was the same one.
3,Pretty good!,"The book was not as great as I was expecting after having read the reviews, but it was enjoyable none the less. I have rarely read a historical set in 1850's California, so the setting was a nice change.Ramon and Caralee were a nice couple."
5,A sensitive and beautiful portrait of loss and redemption.,"Tunstroem fuses the oratorio form and lyrical language to create a captivating intergenerational story of love, loss and faith. It is set in Sweden, New Zealand and Kansas, and is accessible to readers from anywhere on the globe"
3,comprehensive text suffers from opinionated editor,this text is riddled with this very prejudiced editor's personal abberrancies which detract from its value.
4,Read Straight Through - Could not put it down,"Other reviewers mention other books by this author and compare. Since I have never read her books and have nothing to compare this one to, I found the book most compelling. I couldn't put it down. I had to find out what happened to Francie and Stacy, and how Rosalind resolved her problems. I will read other books by this author"
3,Great disappointment when one loved the rest of the series,"For all the repetitive elements in the other books of the C of E series, the others contained gripping spiritual and psychological insight. These elements, though not completely absent from the Wonder Worker, drown in a sea of stereotypes. Insightful Alice's character is diminished by ridiculous but boring stereotypes of the heavy woman drowning her sorrows in ice cream, for example. Jonathan's psychic and healing gifts take second place to his confusing marital problems. The plot twists keep one reading - but, unlike the others in the series, do not lead one to further insight into life and spirituality."
3,Wonder worker was not very likeable,"Nick Darrow, one of the principle characters in this novel, is not one of my favorites. He was introduced in the Church of England series. I did not find the redemption in this book that I have found in Susan Howatch's other books which have a religious theme. I did not really enjoy this read, although after I started I had to finish. So I suppose it was interesting enough to draw one in. Just not one of my favorites of this author."
4,I couldn't put it down.,"After reading the other reviews, I am glad this was my first Susan Howatch novel. I found it a fascinating read and I can't wait to read her other books."
4,Pretty good but not as good as the other novels in the Starb,"I could hardly wait to get my hands on this book!! I loved the other Starbridge novels and was especially fascinated by Jon Darrow i.e. Nick Darrow's father. However, I feel that this book has a slightly repetitious feel about it. I felt more could have been done about Venetia (another fascinating character) and I thought Francie's psychic breakdown rather similar to ""possession sequences"" in the other Starbridge novels. However having said that, overall it was still pretty good. However I look forward to Susan Howatch perhaps taking a whole different direction with her next novel - which I am already looking forward to !"
3,Flawed but fascinating,"I wanted to like this book. I'm an Anglican and an anglophile. It was my first Susan Howatch novel. I knew people who liked it. It was imaginative of the author to write in the voices of four different characters. But! The plot was illogical at times. Most of the characters acted as if they needed emergency psychotherapy a lot more than they needed spiritual direction. The psychological lingo was anachronistic (what professional could diagnose ""an acute psychotic episode resulting from a nervous breakdown"" with a straight face any more?). The only character who made consistent sense was Sister Clare Veronica, Nicholas's spiritual director. Even in the face of all that, though, the book had its strange appeal. After finishing it, I immediately tacked two of the Starbridge novels to see what they were like."
2,A Tedious Installment in a Fascinating Series,"The literary problem with this novel, which so many readers find so riveting, is its construction. The book is broken into five parts narrated by four different interconnected persons. While it is interesting to view events as through a prism, this technique wears thin in page after page of rambling prose. This novel would have been much stronger if it had been edited down. Much too much verbiage! Much too much wandering over the same territory! At one point I wondered why I kept plodding on. The answer is, you get hooked on these characters due to this surplice-ripping series as a whole. Despite several melodramatic moments, nothing much happens in this novel-- it could have been condensed into a fine short story. For a budding Howatch fan, I recommend ""Glittering Images"" or particularly the incredible potboiler ""The High Flyer"" over this book any day."
3,"Interesting at first, but then it fizzled","I found this book to be somewhat tedious to get through. The characters were superficial, stereotypical and so very self absorbed in their own psychology. Howatch seems to be using the characters to showcase her knowledge of psychological processes. However, her understanding of these complexities seems too text book and theoretical when she attempts to apply it to the experiences and insights of her characters. The result is a very self-conscious storyline that at times seemed greatly overworked with shallow characters that remain self absorbed and narcissic and are never really are enlightened in the end. This is my first Howatch book, I won't purchase another."
2,Nothing redeeming,"A drinking, smoking, swearing lady reverend who is separated from her husband and has a lousy relationship with her sister. I read and read looking for something to move Reverend Nash up and over the edge of her constant grieving, but the one character who might have shared some insight for her had a sudden stroke within a few pages of his introduction. Too contrived! The symbolism is too blatant; the characters stereotypical. The only one to love in this novel is the nephew and he had a very forced, brief relationship with his aunt.The author used imagery, but nothing that was especially memorable. The plot twisted every which way. I kept expecting something [anything] to HAPPEN, but Jordanna seemed doomed from the beginning. I had to force myself to read the book after the first few chapters. Don't bother!"
1,Do not waste your money or time!,"I own all 5 of the BSB pocket books, although the pictures are cool and the book is just plain fun looking, the information is totally not accurate! It said that Howie was half Italian and half Scotish, we all know that Howie is half Spanish and half Irish! In Brian's they even spelled his last name wrong! None of the pocket books are worth buying, BSB fans know more than whoever wrote the books!"
2,"Although I'm a HUGE Howie fan, I suggest you...","I suggest you NOT TO BUY this book. It really doesn't worth the price at all! The pictures inside are VERY old pictures of Howie, and the information inside are all VAIN! Those ""secret facts"" inside are all something that you all know, even if you're not a Howie fan! I can honestly say that when I first read this book, I was soooo DISAPPOINTED that I even want to send this book back to Amazon! But still I didn't do that, cos I'm a Howie fan! I love him so much that I even feel guilty to send this book back! But anyway, if you're planning to buy this book and you're looking for something interesting, I'd suggest you to buy another book instead."
4,Texas Geology: One rock at a time,"""Roadside Geology of Texas"" is an excellent resource for amateur geologists and travelers. The illustrations are colorful and the data is organized and presented in reference to travel between points of Texas highway segments. It is an excellent travelogue that makes studying of road cuts and identification of mountain skyline profiles more interesting. It has expanded my appreciation of the geographical and geophysical aspects of the terrain. Great book."
3,Interesting Introduction To Texas Geology,"One of the joys of driving in Texas is the countryside out near Kerville and other hill country towns. The guide provided a lot of insight into the geology of the area which is visible driving through the limestone.I wish the production quality of the book and pictures was better. However, that that and a few other minor annoyances, it's a great book to take on a trip or keep at home if you live in the area. Also great way to introduce kids to geology. The next step is to get them thinking about how geology has affected history. Out in the west topography and the availability of water for drinking, the support of food (both animal and plants) and travel shaped much of its history."
2,A few things...,"Many of the chapters in this book was really good, but a few things I didn't like :* Not a word on concurrency!?!?!? I bought the book to get some thoughts on .Net concurrency strategies, but they completely avoided that subject.* Did the authors of this book communicate at all during the writing of the book? A lot of things was brought up two or more times in different chapters. Propably the last time I buy a book where each chapter was written by a different author./Per Hultqvist"
4,Provides a nice foundation to build on.......,"Let's face it, ADO.NET introduces some brand new concepts and design philosophies that even classic ADO experts are not familiar with.I found that this book provided me with a great ADO.NET foundation to build on. I have read many ASP.NET/WinForm development books and I am of the opinion that ASP.NET/WinForm developers will benefit from a book like this *before* diving into their ASP.NET or WinForm developement books."
4,4 stars,"This book covers just about all the main ways you could want to use the data classes in .NET. If you're used to using ADO with ASP, then the introduction alone maps out the new world of data processing in .NET. If, like me, you are trying to get used to the new way of working in .NET, then you can't do much better than start here.Some coverage of using ADO.NET with Exchange and Active Directory could have made a nice addition to this otherwise excellent book."
2,Good book but not a lot of source code available for VB.Net,"As usual, Wrox gives you a book full of important knowledge, butthe source code in VB.Net, as promised, is rare. There is only a few examples written in VB.net. I was used to much more source code in VB6. I don't recommend this book for somenone that doesn't have time to translate the code in VB.NET.Great book for C# developer"
4,"Solid Story, Interesting Format","The short story From a View to a Kill is a solid and entertaining read. If you like James Bond (and who doesn't?), the story is worth buying just to add to your collection. However, the format of the ""book"" is nontraditional to say the least. It is printed on a ""roadmap"" of sorts - you have to fold it out like any state roadmap - rather than in a normal book style. So, while it's easily transportable and rather cheap, it's not something that you can put on your bookshelf, if that's what you're looking for. But if you want a real Ian Fleming James Bond story to read on the go -- I strongly recommend buying From a View to A Kill."
3,Good but without a cover cards get dusty,"Bigger than it looks and has no cover so if your family rides ATV's around your yard stirring up the dust, get the covered one, I wish I did."
3,rolo,"Kind of bigger and bulkier than I expected. The plastic squeeks. If I had to do it again, I would have bought the more expensive metal one."
5,Rolodex,"I have always wanted to have one of this item for my desk in my room at home. I was pleased when I saw it was on sale. I am enjoying, it flips really easy to get to the alphabets. I would recommend for friends & family.Thanks"
3,"Not terrible, but not great either","I hadn't heard of Augie March before listening ot this cd. Overall, the cd just wasn't that impressive. There was always something that seemed to be missing from the songs. Maybe a tighter rhythm section or a catchier hook could elevate some of the songs from being merely passable. Unfortunately, this album plays it safe and the result is a bland sound that, while ok as background, is just not particularly interesting."
3,Solomon Bellowed,"It grew on me. From the first to the second listenning. But not much. I appreciate the freeness of this CD from the vine program, and understand that I need to review it to get more free stuff. So that being said, it's alright. When I listen to it on my iPod, my gait slows down. I imagine I am the lead character of a hacky prime time drama, thinking vaguely profound voiced-over thoughts as I stare off dreamily while the music comes on. I enjoy that. But not enough to listen through three times. That said, I'm sure these guys are perfectly lovely, and I appreciate the Saul Bellow reference."
2,Bland,"I like a lot of Australian bands: Midnight Oil, The Birthday Party (everything Nick Cave for that matter), Ghostwriters, AC/DC, Regurgitator, Dirty Three, Yothu Yindi, etc. So to hear a band described as, ""...one of the most impassioned and poetic bands in Australia's rich musical history"" sets expectations pretty high. Needless to say from the two star rating, I think a bit of hyperbole was employed in writing that bit of publicity about the band.They aren't terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but neither are they particularly remarkable. It kind of sounds like most bands heard on corporate radio, which is to say, competent performers that don't leave much of an impression on me. ""One Crowded Hour"" gave me high hopes for the record as it is a pretty solid song, but unfortunately, that was as good as it got for me."
3,A Mellow Sound,"I enjoyed this CD. I've never listened to Augie March before, so I wasn't familiar with any of the group's music before popping the CD in.The CD is what I might term ""easy listening."" I don't know if I would call it rock or alternative. The songs are pretty mellow, and none of them stuck out in my mind as memorable- though I did enjoy the first song, One Crowded Hour. It's not the sort of CD I would pop in when I wanted to scream lyrics in my car, but I could listen to it while cooking dinner or reading a book.I guess the most honest way for me to describe the listening experience was that I was underwhelmed. The songs were fine, yes, but nothing to write home about."
3,"Not bad, but gets old","This band reminds me a lot of the Traveling Wilbury's. This album I thought started off well enough, but about half way thru I got bored with it and was happy to hear it end. The songs just start to sound all the same and just seem to sit there. It could have probably been cut in half and been a really decent album. There are some good songs on here, but eventually it just becomes background music."
4,Alt with a 60's feel,"I first heard Augie March on NPR a couple of weeks ago, and was quite taken with their nimble, Dylan-esque lyrics (everyone keeps saying it, but really, it's true) and dreamlike, 60s-psychadelic sound. The album is a terrific compilation of songs that stretch in many directions -- some emo, some jazz, even a little country -- without losing shape for the most part. (My one gripe is that the slightly punk ""Just Passing Through"", while a good listen, just really doesn't seem to fit with everything else on the disc. Perhaps that's intentional, in which case, the joke's on me.)Highly recommended!"
2,I Don't Get It...,"at all. All music is subject to individual taste (perhaps more than any other art form) and this album did not suit mine. I actually liked the openning song ""One Crowdwed Hour"" and hoped it was the sign of more to come but the CD fizzled pretty fast from there. The songs were very non-descript and unremarkable. I kept waiting for that one song that would catch me and draw me in. It wasn't there."
3,3.5 Stars - pretty good,"This 5 piece band from Australia is not that well known in the US yet but this could possibly change that. Their music is very melodic and most of it is not that loud so it should appeal to a wide audience. The singing is very good with okay lyrics and good musicanship throughout. All in all, 3.5 stars with some of the songs, especially the leadoff track ""One Crowded Hour"" better than that. A promising effort."
2,Throw these guys on the barbie....,"I'm not sure why this was a Vine offering, or frankly, why I was given one already released music CD and four books as options to review. I strickly do music reviews, but anyway, I was bored stiff with this band when I first heard them LAST YEAR!The song's all begin the same, a tired croon of a guitar and then his voice is more irritating than the worst of self-indulgent Wilco.There's oh, about 1200 bands in America doing ballad emo better than this Aussie import. And any song titled Victoria's Secret has two strikes against it to begin with, and then when it is basically a remix of the preceding song, well, stop telling this songwriter he's the next Bob Dylan.If you want to hear a brilliant Aussie band try the Lovetones. Their CD blew me away.A Bottle of RainNowhere Near the Sea of Cortez"
3,Excellent musicianship yet inexplicably boring,"this sounds nice, especially in the background. mid-tempo folk rock vibe, reminiscent of early counting crows. but just not as catchy, kind of lifeless (as if the songs are overworked), and the way the vocals are buried in the mix are frustrating in this case. after a half-dozen listens, i just felt like i would be happier listening to something more rewarding--like the new iron & wine, radiohead, beirut, or jens lekman (to give you an idea of where i'm coming from)."
4,"Solid but overproduced, can we get a live album?","Augie March are a talented pool of musicians playing around the borders of musical styles and influences effectively. The lyrics can be overwrought (or overthought) but often come off as a slanted poem.The opening track One Crowded Hour is a prime little piece of tunesmanship, and there are couple of other minor pop gems to be found here. My problem with this album is that it feels forced and studiofied, everything is tight and packed together and shimmers digitally lacking any kind of analog funk or rawness. I prefer their last album STRANGE BIRD by far as it is a more ethereal and experimental experience than the mostly straightforwad songs from this album. An interesting band to keep an eye on as they are talented and driven. Check out the 2004 release STRANGE BIRD to see what they are really capable of."
3,promising,"This album has quite a few excellent moments, particularly where lyrics and sound come into a kind of agreement. They're more literate than most, without being egg-heads, and able to construct some good melodies. I am less thrilled with the music per se, which tends to smear into brown-noise and has a hard time maintaining an idea. Production is much too dense. I'd love to hear some of these songs pared down, stripped of excess wall-of-noise-ness."
4,A Pleasant Collection of Music,"This CD is pleasing enough in an acoustic/indie type of way. Reminds me of some of the innocent '60s bands, early Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, that sort of thing. The lead singer's voice sounds A LOT like Tom Petty!It seems like it would be good background music at a cocktail party at low volume - not intrusive, but more interesting than instrumentals."
2,"Good, but not remarkable","A finely produced Australian effort, ""Moo, You Bloody Choir,"" is a fair record, but ultimately unremarkable. If you already know the band, you may be pleased, but if, like me, this is your first introduction to Augie March, you won't find any stand out tracks or moments memorable enough to recommend the album to friends. You will have all already moved on."
3,average,"MOO, YOU BLOODY CHOIR starts and ends strong, though it breaks little new ground, but the middle -- songs 4 through 11 -- is a mish-mash of mostly mellow music that is sometimes listenable, seldom memorable, and frequently too clever (like weird few-second intros to songs) for its own good. It's in this middle section that Glenn Richards's vocals become most indecipherable and most grating -- unlike in tracks like ""One Crowded Hour,"" where more upbeat (and, frankly, more interesting) melodies carry the song and mask the drawling vocals.""Clockwork"" is easily the best track on the album. Complex and layered, it gradually builds to an epic climax and repays repeat listening. If I had my way, it would have closed the album, not ""Vernoona.""Overall, MOO, YOU BLOODY CHOIR is an average offering, though the brilliance of ""Clockwork"" redeems it somewhat."
3,This album is just ok.,"After this album I either know exactly what to expect from other Augie March works, or I haven't a clue. I feel like there were many different sounds on the album and not much consistency. While the variety of sounds was pleasant, I have a hard time deciding to whom I would recommend this album. There are some solid tracks on here and very few that I feel the need to skip when the CD plays. From that angle, this album is a success. I just wish I could get to know the band more from this selection, but then again if they do not have a signature sound, then I know them just fine. For my money I like songs with a little more energy too them and on that criteria alone Augie March and I were not able to connect.""One Crowded Hour"" is the crowd-pleasing favorite, but as an added bonus I like ""Mother Greer."""
4,"An intriguing mix, well worth a listen","Okay, this certainly isn't the type of album I would typically pick up. But my music tastes certainly lean toward the eclectic and I'm always interested in listening to something different. However, after loading this album into my CD player and listening to the first song that it randomly loaded ""Clockwork"" I was thinking that this was a mistake. This fairly slow, repetitive song was not at all to my taste. As the album progressed though, I was pleasantly surprised. There is definitely a ""Dylan-esk"" tone to the lead singer's voice and the songs themselves are not at all repetitive, ranging from more soft, tender music, almost folksy in tone, to more of the type of hard songs that I would equate with typical alternative rock. Overall there are more enjoyable tunes on here than stinkers and it's definitely the type of album I will enjoy on additional listens."
1,Buyer Beware!,"If You're planning on buying this DVD for *the* scene of Patrick Dempsey's private bits, don't waste Your money.I'd been waiting years for a DVD release of this great film, in the hopes that I'd get to see what was missing on the sides of my full-frame VHS copy. What I got instead was a ""matted"" widescreen, which is basically that full-frame version with the top & bottom lopped off (thus cropping out Patrick's flash).MGM really dropped the ball on this one. They should have included both the matted widescreen version AND the full-frame version like they did with the sci-fi flick ""Supernova"" (it'd easily fit - there are no extras on the 90 min. disc anyway)."
2,SOME GIRLS,"SOME GIRLS is a real curio. The reason why I purchased it was for the talented Oscar-winners, Jennifer Connelly and Lila Kedrova. I remember when I first saw this film on cable. It wasn't a great film, but the cast (especially the wonderful Kedrova as Connelly's grandmother) kept it interesting. Connelly's family is definitely interesting all right. Only recommended for fans of Patrick Dempsey or the beautiful Connelly."
1,"a bad, disjointed movie","Based on other reviews here on Amazon I took a chance on this movie. What a bad decision. They try to portray Jennifer Connelly's family as an ecentric bunch, and they succeed. But that aspect of the movie, as well as the overall plot, never leads me to care one bit about them and what is going on in this film. I had the VHS version and found myself fast scanning through portions after the first hour just to get to the end."
2,Pass on this one.....,"Doesn't any one find it unacceptable for a family to have multiple-sexual encounters with the same guest (stranger) in their home? This film borders on incestous behavior. It is not worth the time of day and has little, if any, redeeming value. As far as putting it on DVD....what a waste of energy. I rated this film ""2 stars"" because even though I very much did not like the film, the 1 star rating stipulation of ""hatred"" is too strong of a term. Why bother to invest the emotional & mental energy of hatred? I would rather stay healthy. Irresponsible behavior is quite a problem within our society today. We seem to CELEBRATE that which is tasteless, worthless, and degenerate behavior. Just wanted to weigh-in and represent another perspective :-) I do however very much appreciate Patrick Dempsey as an actor. Have a good Day!"
2,Will not hold 100 cards...,"Great size and all, but it will not hold 100 cards, as it claims. I have maybe 35 cards in there (probably less), including several credit cards and the lid will not close. I know credit cards are thicker, but I should be able to put more than what I have now..."
5,Works great,"Works great under Windows XP professional. This device creates it own virtual drives based on which type of card you place into the unit. Example: smart media card will create an E:\ drive, Compaq Flash will create an F:\ drive...etc.... The device creates 4 drives on your computer regardless of whether or not you have a card in any of the bays. This might create a problem if you are attached to a network with a lot of mapped drives. Other than that, it works SUPER, and the price is pretty good too."
1,Partially Dead on Arrival,"I am sure this is a good product, but the one I brought did not work properly. It could read and write Compact Flash and Smart Media cards, but when I inserted a Memory Stick or a Secure Digital card I was always prompted to insert a disc in the drive. That is, it did not recognize the latter formats.This must be a sample defect, but it was disappointing and I returned the drive."
1,Dissapointing,"Kim Kashkashian is exhellent when dealing with contemporary composers, but it's apparent she does not understand how Bach should be interpreted.As for mr. Jarrett, its equally apparent that he urgently needs lessons on how to play the harpsichord. Mrs Celine Frisch plays the same repertoire with double dexterity and expressiveness, despite being half Jarrett's age..."
4,rolodex 3x5 cards,"I bought the product b/c I needed the 3x5 rolodex cards and couldn't find them. The product it self is usable, although takes up alot of space. The company that sent it to me ( not Amazon) packaged it poorly."
4,To Veronica Hawkins,"Veronica, an answer to your question about cauls....In folklore, a person born with a caul, a thin membrane of amniotic fluid which sometimes inexplicably remains covering the head of a newborn child at birth, is supposedly blessed with the gift of ``second sight'' and other supernatural powers."
4,3 in 1 Dean Koontz novels,"I enjoy Dean Koontz books, the only drawback is that the 3-1 book is too big to carry around in my purse compared to a paperback book. Great read though."
5,Some of his best ever!!,"Although, I have these novels in paperback, it's nice to have them as a collection. Shattered was an earlier road chase story which I think Mr. Koontz, as he matured, turned into Intensity.Watchers was the first Koontz novel I read and is still my all-time favorite. The pairing of opposites, the lonely madianly woman with the quick-witted hereo, and the introduction of the golden retreiver, for me, was his break-through novel.Too bad they have never redone Watchers and Whispers into quality films.I think that Mr. Koontz could now at least bankroll part of the production and I for one would stand in line to see them.I recommend this collection to those who don't know Koonz's work, you'll become hooked.I also recommed a new religious conspiracy spy thriller Solomon's Key: the COIS Project. Like Koontz, R. Douglas Weber writes convincing, strong female leads.SOLOMON'S KEY THE CODIS PROJECT: A CONSPIRACY THRILLER"
1,I don't recomend this,I only read two of the stories and figured the third was more of the same so I recycled it.
5,Excellent intro to Koontz,"Watchers was the very first novel by Koontz I read when I was in college. I read it over the weekend not only b/c it was the only *free* time I had, but b/c I could not put it down. I read the other novels in later years, but most definitely, if the reader is looking for material worth your time, then pick up a Koontz novel. Also, I would suggest Dark Rivers of the Heart, also by Koontz, this one is great for anyone who enjoys gadgets."
5,Excellent Book! One of Koontzs Best!,This is the BEST COLLECTION OF BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ BEFORE in my life. All these books puts you at the edge of your seat and you will never stop turning the pages! This book is a must get! Koontz grabs your throat and pulls you into his nightmarish wold of horror!
2,The Nativity,The Nativity was a little weak in areas so it would drag a bit.Probally not worth the price
1,Classic rotary file,"It is nice that this is small, but there are NO replacement cards available any where... I have been looking for YEARS for these small cards 1 3/4 X 3 1/4 and there are NONE to be found. Absolutely useless after you fill all of your cards."
3,miscellaneous item,nice to be able to purchase office supplies easily. Item was not quite what I expected but will work for my needs
1,Rolodex,"The product was shipped and received in a timely fashion. Rolodex was damaged when I opened the box.The company (shoplet) explains how to return an item, however when I followed the instructions to receive a return code, the program didn't work. There was no phone number to call to reach customer service."
1,Don't Do It,"Nobody carries the replacement cards, can't even find them online. (And here are a few more words to make the 20-word minimum.)"
2,Desktop roladex,"The item looks great and has great styling but the flimsy cards are really cheap and thin. Additionally, the cards don't flip and separate the way they do on the larger models with thicker cards. I think you are better off with a box style"
3,GOLDWYN AND COLMAN,"After advertising for adventure, ex-war hero Colman is approached by American Bennett whose uncle is being held prisoner. Colman's pleasing, euphonic voice enchanted audiences in 1929; many great silent star's careers were over the moment they spoke for the microphone! The lack of action is offset by Colman's grand performance which was true to the original Drummond character. This rather stiff early talkie is consistently interesting, however a sequel, BULLDOG DRUMMOND STRIKES BACK (1934) is even better!"
2,Not my taste,I thought that I would get a musky smell but it just didn't fit my liking. Maybe someone else would like the flowery smell but its too much for me.
4,Very Fascinating!,"This book is informative and comprehensive about Fallschirmjager in World War II. It illustrates many photos and detailed narration that are easy to understand about German Paratroopers' creation, campaigns of the war in Europe and Africa, and distinctive equipment and weapons."
5,Simplicity is elegance,Because of the simplicity of the language and the timlessness of the ideas...The eternal NOW from the Past and present.
4,soap shop rock,"amon duul II is most def. the better of the two amon duul bands and this landmark 1970 album cements that status. this is often looked at as their best album (this and Phallus Dei) and once the cd kicks off...it's not hard to understand why. the 4 songs that make up the miniature rock epic ""soap shop rock"" starts it up and at almost 16 minutes, it will keep you interested to hear more. the fuzzy bass...the rocking distorted guitar, the strange male and female vocals, the druggy noisy interludes....it's all here. i notice alot of Amon Duul II's influence on modern 'stoner rock' ands like Fu Manchu or Clutch; esp. on songs like ""Archangels Thunderbird."" isn't that a great title?"
1,"NOT a reflection of the music, just the files","I'm a high-fi bitsnob--I want my music so crisp and detailed that only a spectral analyzer could appreciate it. I ripped this album at 192k back before I could tell the difference and wanted to rectify the situation. I downloaded these files and while they are technically a higher bitrate (and larger to prove it) they do not sound as good as the ones I had before. The hiss on these files is audible and maddening. This is an old record, but the masters must be in very good shape because I have heard versions with no hiss, and total clarity on CD. My old 192k mp3s had the expected digital artifacts, but NO hiss. Do not download from here if you're expecting a crisp mastering.Long story short (too late) the drums are muddy.Sidenote: This version has the now seemingly standard truncated track ""Pale Gallery"" reduced by nearly three minutes. Also, the files are not 256k CBR, they are VBR, in the 230k-range."
5,"Brainmelting, indeed","This is the record I have been looking for my whole life. It is an incredible mix that carries and ages well into its 30 plus years. Makes most of the other music that is called psychedelic seem pretty lame by comparison, especially the one always held on a pillar, Pink Floyd, who seemed more concerned with making happy sounds without an ounce of tension to please headbangers, rather than in wearing their art on their shirtsleeve, as it were!This is where it is at. The Whole Krautrock thing splintered into a few directions, and from my knowledge of it, Yeti is essential, along with Faust IV, Ege Bamyasi by Can, the first Kraftwerk record, and a few others. Hopefully it remains available..."
5,Deserves consideration,"Callahan provides a rigorous examination of the Epistle to Philemon, concluding that Philemon and Onesimus were not slaveholder/slave, but rather estranged blood brothers. Thus Paul's letter serves as a gentle attempt at reconciliation between relatives.Although some biblical scholars such as Douglas Moo and Marianne Thompson have discussed (briefly, in footnotes) some problems with Callahan's thesis, the idea that Onesimus was not Philemon's slave, or at least that Onesimus was not a runway, deserves more consideration than it has received.Some doctrinal questions are raised by this theory. First, how does the New Testament approach slavery, without relying on Philemon? Second, should spiritual leaders involve themselves in interpersonal disputes, and if they do, how should they go about it?"
3,fair,"the quality and condition was good. the price was fair enough. however for me personally, the content was not at all what i was expecting from the description, nor was it what i was really looking for."
4,Old view of Onesimus revived.,"Dr. Callahan's credentials cannot be easily questioned: assistant professor of New Testament at Harvard Divinity School. The question that is most important in my mind is his contention that Onesimus was the brother of Philemon. It is not a new idea. Many times the thought is brought forward by anti-slavery clergy in the 1850's because this little letter to Philemon was in Henry Ward Beecher's assessment ""used as a club"" by both pro and anti-slavery advocates. Callahan comes closer than any other writer I know in justifying this theory.This is not just a commentary on Paul's epistle. The author dedicates many pages to relating this to current poitics and social values. If the reader wants commentary only I suggestThe Letter to Philemon."
1,Don't Bother to Buy!,"This production is a waste of money and time! If you like drunk-dirt-bag chicks, then this is for you. Filming, production, editing and quality sucks. It looks like some ""frat-boys"" got a hold of Dad's camcorder! Not one good looking girl in the entire DVD. I am just going to toss my copy in the trash and rid the viewing public with one less copy of this cheap production."
5,Reality !,"This was a good book, and a must read for anyone considering becoming a host family.Joan reveals the day-to-day details of her experiences and describes what life becomes when a foriegn teenager comes to the USA.It reminded me of reality TV. A cross between ""Seinfeld"" and the Osbournes.Very enjoyable."
2,man or astrovan? yes astrovan!,No more starcrunch No more astromen? The poor earthling that is trying to fill our fellow spaceboy Starcrunch's space boots just cannot complete the mission.
4,we really need an updated edition that covers gnu make,"This was a good reference book when it originally came out. But these days, who doesn't use GNU make? O'Reilly should come out with either an updated version that covers GNU make as well as vanilla make or they should release two separate books."
2,You're better off reading the GNU make documentation,"I'm an ardent consumer of O'Reilly books, but I was quite disappointed with the quality of their make book. I read it about 5 years ago with a rudimentary understanding of make, yet it did little to further explain things I already knew.I recently read the GNU make documentation and clarified many fuzzy make concepts. I recommend it over the ORA make book. Besides, GNU make is cooler than vanilla make. 8-)"
1,Didn't add to my knowledge of Make.,"Before reading this book, I had already had some experience with 'make' utilities through my experiences with the OpenVMS Module Management System (MMS) facility (Compaq's version of make). At our site, We use MMS and Make not only for product compilation, but also for product versioning and installation as well. Although this book contains more material then the UNIX man pages, this small book (<125 pages) really didn't expand my knowledge of make (I found the OpenVMS MMS user documentation more enlightening, although still lacking). This book tries to be all things to all people, and ends up being a few things to some. For the next edition, the authors should consider expanding the content to include more real-world examples, shortcuts and tricks. The book should also place more emphasis on using the 'makedepend' utility as well as maintaining products with multiple versioned subsystems."
2,Index very very shallow,"Maybe this is a good book, but you wouldn't be able to tell that by the index. Something as basic as using conditionals with make(if .. then) should be indexed for easy referance. I've had to root through the book for various situations like this because the index was so sparse. I have had much more luck using the GNUmake online manuals which are free."
4,"Dry, but containing all of the necessary information","The style of the book is somewhat dry, but it covers all of the information that one would expect of a thorough book on the subject. Clear comparisons are made between different versions of make, and test scripts are available for download to test your version of make.However, a section is needed which provides a clear answer to the question ""What features can I use to have truly portable makefiles?"" Also, a commons tips and tricks section, which could cover some of the ways that make can be used to accomplish other tasks (related to the building of an application). The information is all there, but the organization needs some work.Overall, a good book. Read it once, and then keep it close by on your shelf for reference. Anyone who has had to re-write makefiles because of porting issues will find this book very useful."
2,Not good for gassy babies!,"I used these bottles for expressed breast milk to give my husband a chance to feed our baby. The bottles do not leak, like I have read in the other reviews. But, I used the #1 nipple which takes my daughter 45 minutes to finish and she constantly falls asleep during feeding. The #2 stage nipple took her only 15 minutes but she had horrible gas pains after she was done even though she was burped several times during feeding. I switched to Dr. Brown's bottles which eliminated the gas problem all together."
5,Great Bottle if you pay attention!,These bottle are wonderful. The onlly problem that you may face is that they do leak if you don't put the top on correctly. You have to pay attention to how you put it on. If it is on the right way it will never leak for you! Another great thing about Avent is that all their products areinterchangeable:)
3,learning the trick to stopping the leaks,"As a first time mom looking at all of the baby and parenting magazines all I saw were advertisememnts for Advent bottles. When we registered at Babies R Us I recognized these bottles and figured why not try them.The first few times we used them they didn't leak. But then one day they just started leaking and I started going crazy. At two in the morning I really didn't enjoy wearing as much of the formula as my daughter drank because the bottle leaked around the rim.Then my husband figured out the trick to stop the leaks! When you pull the nipple through the rim and it is snaps into place, twist the nipple in the ring. That will ensure the nipple is seated correctly then screw the ring onto the bottle. You should feel it when the nipple seals against the bottle.Even though I now know how to do it correctly when my little girl is done with these bottle they will be going in the trash. I do not want to deal with these bottles the next time I have a baby."
5,Great gift,"This set really is great. It has 4 9oz bottles, slow flow (number 2) nipples, 4 sealing disks, 4 travel nipple bases, and a newborn pacifier.This, combined with a 3pk of 4oz bottles makes a a great start to infant feeding. It will also save you some money because you won't need to buy the Breast Milk Storage kit."
2,not as great as it looks:(,"I agree with the other reviews, it is a great set has all the bottles you need to get started. However my child constantly has formula dripping from her mouth. The nipple is too big and allows the baby to get way more then she can swallow. It drips down her face the whole time she is eating. I hate it!!! This is my third child so I wanted to try the newest bottle available and I really like the look of the bottle. Don't like the way her outfits look all wet and stained and can't tell how much she is getting cause she's wearing most of the milk on her clothes.."
2,Disappointed as well...,"I received Avent bottles with both stage 2 and newborn nipples for my baby when she was born a little over 2 months ago. I was excited because of their excellent reputation for nursing mothers. I also received the Playtex Disposable Nurser system as a gift. The flow of the Avent nipples are just way too fast for her (even the newborn ones!!!)--she chokes because the flow is too fast (my sister-in-law said the flow was too fast for her newborn when I asked her about them as well). So, I've been using the Playtex bottles with the slow flow nipples for the few bottle feedings she gets, and they work fine. I hope that I will be able to use the Avent bottles when she is older."
2,Not best for breastfeeding mothers,"I bought these bottles because I was told time and time again that they were the best for breastfed babies. Not at all true! The flow is way too fast (even with size 1 nipples), the bottles leak if you do not put them on just right, and the niplles are too hard. Try the Playtex natural latch nipples,they are so so so much better. My son does wonderfully with them."
2,The only thing I use them for....,"...is to store breastmilk in the fridge, and when it's time to feed my baby, I transfer the milk to a ventaire bottle. WHY? After many parents telling me to try the Avent bottles because they are the best, I decided to do a little research. I checked out the reviews, which were mixed, so I went out and bought the Dr Brown's bottles, and I already had the ventaire set in my baby's closet and the Avent (I also have Evenflo). The Avent bottles never leaked on me, but the nipple was just too hard and my baby was very gassy after every feeding! The Dr Brown bottles I thought would actually work, but more violent gas for my baby! I like the set Avent bottles come in, with the pacifier and the lids, and I've used them all! They are great for storing milk in, but I just don't use them to feed my baby! Ventaires are way better."
1,Do Not Buy These Bottles !!!!,"All the hype and high price tag are not worth it for these bottles. The only way you can get the nipples on these bottles without leaking is to put them on soooo tight that you can't get it off to wash them. Everytime I put the lid on and started to give to my son, it leaked (not a small little drop, I mean like pouring out!!!) all over him and I had to change his outfit. I should have wrote to the company and ask them to reimburse me for all of the laundry detergent that I went through because of the leaking. Several reviews, state if you do this they wont leak or if you do that or dont screw it on too tight or put the cap on and twist at this angle. I am sorry, but when you have a newborn, the last thing that you want to do is have to refer to the directions on the box at 3 am feeding!!!! Its a bottle, not a NASA Rocket! I used the platex liner bottles with my daughter and if I have another child, I will use platex, never these bottles again"
1,Leaky bottles,These bottles leak everywhere. If you dont properly line up the ridges when you screw the nipple they will leak all over you and baby. Save your precious breastmilk and/or expensive formula and buy another brand. They stink!!!
1,HORRIBLE BOTTLES,This brand is a joke. I can't believe they can manufacture and actually sell these things. It doesn't matter whether the lid is on loose or tight - they LEAK everywhere nearly every time. It is SO frustrating. I invested so much money in them hoping they were of good quality - they aren't! You can't even buy disposable refills by themselves or lids to the storage containers. This brand should be ashamed of themselves.
2,There Are Better Bottles,"Although they have a good reputation, they definately have a drawback. They are short and fat bottles, so you really have to lean your baby back to get all the liquid to the nipple. Now that my son is holding his own bottle, we don't use them for that fact-it's just too hard for him to get his formula to the nipple, he gets too frustrated. All in all I'd say buy a different bottle."
5,Great Product and Outstanding Customer Support,"I used the Avent feeding system for both of my children, from newborn through the toddler years. I pumped directly into the bottles, froze the milk in them and then was able to send the bottles to care-givers to use to feed my babies while I was at work. Later, we grew into the Avent sippy cups without the children having any difficulty giving up the bottles.When I had questions about the products, I called the help line. The operators are very knowlegable and were able to quickly and effectively answer my questions. In fact, Avent even replaced a part of my Isis pump for free, with free shipping.As to the leaking issue: do not screw the lids on too tightly! Screwing the lids on too tightly will cause the nipple rims to buckle and leak.Again, I used all aspects of the Avent product line, especially the bottles, for two children and have nothing but the highest praise for the products."
1,Hated these bottles,I tried Avent bottles since they were so popular. I hated them! They leaked all over my daughter during feeding and made her bib and her soaked by the end. I wonder how much formula she really got. We used Dr. Brown's and they were so much better. Skip Avent and try others!
2,Ok bottle but leaks a lot,"I got a lot of avent bottles for my baby shower so I decided I would try using this brand over the rest of them. After a week of them leaking all over everything I gave up and switched to Playtex with drop-ins. My son hated the Avent ones, he was very gassy with them also. Once I switched to Playtex things improved right away.Some good points: they are easy to clean and you can use them in a bottle warmer but other than that I can't stand the leaking and the fact my baby was so gassy."
2,"Leaky, Leaky, Leaky","I used these through out my daughter's infancy, largely because I bought a whole set of them, the milk storage contraptions, the breast pump, and the pacifiers. Plus once she was used to the pacifiers and nipples she wouldn't take any other kind.But the bottles routinely leaked, ruining several diaper bags, clothing, and nighttime feedings.Apparently you have to screw the cap on just right- which is really difficult at 3 AM!My daughter didn't seem to have the gas and colic that other reviews talk about, but we did use quite a bit of gas medicine between 3 and 6 months.All in All, I think the paci's are great, the rest of it I could do without."
1,Ready to throw the bottles through the window!!!!,"Like many others, I registered for these bottles because they were supposed to be the best out there. After they started leaking, I just sucked it up for a while. Then I got aggravated enough to write to AVENT on their website. They wrote back to me that I was screwing them on too tight. So, i took their advice, and now, after washing the diaper bag for the umpteenth time because the contents of the bottles spilled out all over, I have written to them again. I don't think that I should have to worry about how tight I am screwing the tops on. I should be able to twist the top on and rest assured that my child won't go hungry and scream because his formula is all over the bottom of the diaper bag!"
1,Horrible,I am so glad that I did not purchase these bottles for myself (they were a gift). Every single bottle leaks. It is very frustrating when you are up in the middle of the night trying to soothe your little one back to sleep & go to make a bottle just for it to leak all over. Not only is the leaking a problem the vacum it creates & the amount of air your baby drinks is horrible. I switched to Playtex Vent-Air which was better & then finally gave in & purchased the Dr. Browns. I used Avent for 1 month before switching & the day after noticed a huge difference. I thought Avent would be a good brand because of all the items & amount of space they give the Avent products in the baby store but take my advice & spend a few extra dollars to get a better bottle. I am sure your little one will appreciate it.
2,Convenient but unreasonable,"The ideas for the bottles interchanging is great. But unfortunately the nipples cause too much gas. When they're using the bottle, you can hear constant air sucking in around their lips. Every time my little girl uses them, it seems as though she just can't get comfortable with them. I would recommend Dr.Brown's or Playtex VentAire bottles over any of these.Ultimately, the convenience and features aren't worth the massive amount of gas the avent bottles cause."
3,So-so,"To be completely honest I think avent bottles in general have just as many ups as they do downs. I love that they are all interchangeable. I can use them with the spillproof cup tops for my 2 year old as well as with nipples for my 9 month old. However I have on occasion had problems with formula running out the side of my daughters mouth also. And unlike some of the other companies, I can't just go buy some extra rings or caps if they get lost. The only way to replace them is to buy a whole new bottle. So like I said I guess they have just as many ups as downs."
2,Disappointed,"I am a first time mother, who bought these bottles because they were supposed to be the best. My child was really gassy. He also ended up wasting a lot of his food each time because the nipple is way too fast for a newborn. I was really disappointed with these bottles. I switched to the Playtex disposable bottles, and he has been much happier since I have. Also, he gets every bit of food I give him now."
1,One word sums up Avent bottles-- LEAK,"We have bought numerous bottles from Avent and a vast majority of them leak. Don't believe the ""user-error"" excuse as other bottles from other manufacturers are much, much better."
2,Too much dribbling,"We started giving one bottle a day to our daughter at 2 weeks of age, and are otherwise breastfeeding.The first bottle system we tried was the Avent since so many people rave about it.But, it seemed as though she was dribbling out more milk than she was swallowing. I have since heard the same complaint from other parents (with both formula and breastmilk).We had much more success with the Platex Natural Shape VentAire, and continue to use that system today.This is her favorite pacifier, though."
1,Leaky Bottles,"I bought the Avent bottles when I was pregnant because they were babiesrus's ""Best Pick"" Yeah right! I wonder how many are returned on a daily basis. Aparently this company spends all their time and money on advertising and not enough on preventing their bottles from leaking! I would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money!"
2,Really not helpfull,They sometimes leak and it's really difficult to heat the milk inside because the plastic is too tick. It takes forever to warm the milk which make baby really frustrated !!! Think of nightime feeding !!!!
2,Avent Bottle - not as good as Dr. Browns,"I purchased the Avent Bottles because I had been using Dr. Browns and didn't want to hassle with having to wash 4 parts. I was very disappointed with the Avent because it leaked and gave my daughter gas. No matter how I closed the bottle, and reopening and reclosing it, it always leaked. After being frustrated with it, I finally switched back to Dr. Brown's. At least my daughter's clothes (and mine) don't get wet from the leaks anymore."
2,very leaky!!!,"I have a four month old son and when registering for bottles I chose Avent.I work at a daycare and I noticed a lot of the infants had these bottles.I also liked their compact size and wide opening for cleaning.Avent bottles have one BIG problem, they leaked almost every time I used them-BADLY!!!When tilting the bottle to an upright position to burp my son, a good 1/2oz. to 1oz. would come streaming from the nipple ring.It did not matter how tight my husband or I would tighten the ring, the same thing would happen.So if you do not want to waste your formula or breastmilk,look for different bottles!"
2,No Second Chance,"My husband and I purchased this set with my first son, but are going to choose another bottle manufacturer for our second son. The difficultly we experienced was securing the nipple ring onto the base - it had to be in perfect alignment or there were definately leaks, sometimes more than that. It is quite frustrating when you are conducting late night feedings or traveling. I hope a new second chose will brings easier bottle feedings."
3,Bottles did not decrease colic in my child,I have a ton of the Avent Bottles. It was suggested by a friend that I register for them. I should have waited until after my daughter was born. She had such a hard time with the nipples and then she would have a lot of gas. The Avent bottles are supposed to cut down on gas and colic. It didn't work for my daughter. I ended up switching to the Dr. Brown's bottles at the advice of my mother-in-law. We are a much happier family now.
2,Slow Slow Read,Relative Interest was a very slow read. Took to long to get to the plot. A struggle for me to keep reading. There was some good things about the novel but the ending wasn't realistic. Not one I am recommending.
5,unlock your wallet and buy this book!,what a great book! bisiker has written an engaging book on self improvement...pages 26 through 29 are self awareness/ self exploration check-off lists that will have your mind reeling....i have given it as gifts and my friends love it...it is also wonderful to use as a tool with people in counseling.modern and bright style to the fonts and graphics.you will really like this workbook...
4,"Overpriced, but Excelent!!!","If you could (and you can) find this label printer for about half the price, it's well worth it. This is a great little USB lable printer that takes up very little space. Though I find the mouse pad portion useless and small, it can be removed. I agree with the other reviews, the software is limited, but the hardware is great. You can print from 6mm to 18mm tapes. Great for organizing cluttered offices or homes! Very versitile."
2,Limited use,"You can print text by highlighting. However you cannot set it up as a standard printer. If you want to intergrate into your applications, you're limited to selected text and printing it. I have an Avery Label printer which can be setup as a standard printer via the com port."
1,"rough install, wastes tape","Purchased several, had problems each time I tried to install. Poor support. I do NOT recommend. never did get to work with XP!"
1,Ouch,Printer adds unneeded space before and after printing. Very difficult to get backing off label.
1,Poor Performer,"A definite do not buy. There are too many limitations and not enough capability as compared to others. I purchased one, then had to buy another model to get the service desired."
1,knobs cheaply made no replacements,we have only had this rolodex brand for a few years one of the turn knobs broke inside and they say there is no way to replace it so we now have a strong frame as they say and no way to use it hope this makes the next buyer rethink the quality of ROLODEX.
5,"Smoosh is youthful bliss, even with all the growing pains and aches","This is the music little kids ought to listen to. It's made by two (nearly) teenage girls, sisters, from Washington. They play their own instruments, write their own songs, and have indie ""cred"" and sensibility. It's sweet, genuine, and evokes blissful youth along with the intense growing pains accompanied by it.Since their first official album, ""She Like Electric,"" Smoosh has grown considerably. Asya's voice has become stronger, though still bears the honey-gloss shimmer apparent on the last album. Her piano playing has also improved immensely, adding slick, playful harmonies atop her fuzzy, bass-y melodies. Chloe's drumming is also still impressive. This sister team works really well, and it shows easily.All in all, ""Free To Stay"" is Smoosh's way of proving that age has little to do with quality output when pure talent is involved. Hopefully Smoosh decides to stay around, because they are certainly free to."
2,Ever want to listen to a high-school talent show? And not like a school of the arts talent show?,"Honestly, there's a little talent in there somewhere. It's not completely horrible, but the slightly off-key nasal vocal runs become grating quickly. The songwriting is quick, simple and painless, basically thoughtless. Again, it's a lot of vocal runs that shouldn't be done. I'm not sure how these two are making it, but I wouldn't expect them to last without some major improvement. Good luck to them, I hope they stick with it. I'd expect great things in a few years."
3,A nice selection from the album!,"This CD is a great appetizer for those who don't want to hear the whole album. The only bad thing, is that it doesn't include Beck's ""Deadweight"". With that song on, it would have make an excellent choice."
4,An out of print book which is still lovely and useful,I was lucky enough to find a used copy of this text. Still a useful and wonderful book. It has a wealth of information not normally found in other books. A book made for oceanographers.
5,sick album,this album is off the chain. if you dig real hiphop then you gotta hear this. also check out other artist from the sandpeople.
1,End broke,First time I used it it broke. The snap mechanism on the end broke and locked the bit in it.I had great hopes for this item but it let me down.
2,heavy duty flex extension,"Works great for light duty use. But, not very strong. I brokeit about the 2nd or 3rd use. Will buy another flex extension ifI can find one that's rugged."
5,Inspired and Creative Harp Music,"I love this CD! The musical ideas are brilliant, the construction of the pieces is ingenious, and the sound of the work is mesmerizing. The only fault I could find is that there's not enough of it!I used to visit Gail Laughton about a year before he died. He said he played a lot in Las Vegas and on the drives back across the desert, with the sound of the car engine and the monotony, he would enter into a state almost of hypnotic trance, and the ideas for these pieces would come to him, almost in the sense of 'channeling.'The different moods of each piece evoke the ambience of the vaious periods they represent quite successfully; the CD is a total pleasure to listen to."
5,The Endurance,The Endurance was a fascinating acccount of survival. We read it before our trip to Antactica and it made the trip even more meaningful seeing the area where these men fought for survival.
4,Haunting photographs of an incredible adventure by heros.,"This book will satisfy any desire to escape from the mundane existance we all endure. You get to journey with them, and the story will captivate you. I only wish there was an index, as all through the book I had to constantly thumb through previous pages to figure out who was who. There never is a list of who the crew is and who does what. This aspect has to be pieced together. The only shortcoming. Don't let that deter you. The photographs alone are worth the price, and the first and the final photograph (the same one) is quite remarkable for the insight the author provides. To get to know these men and their dogs is quite satisfying."
5,I could feel the cold,I could not put this book down. It humbles me to think that men like this have existed in this world. Every petty trouble melts away when compared to the Shackleton crew. The photographs are also great. Caroline Alexander did wonderful job!
5,The Endurance,"A facinating story of triumph. Caroline Alexander has done a wonderful job of taking the reader back to the romatic era of global exploration. I was amazed at the struggles that Shackleton and his crew faced. The details that are included in this non-fiction story coupled with the stunning photographs highlight the daily adventures of the crew, and bring the reader along for the ride. This retelling of the Antarctic journey of The Endurance is an encouragement to press on through hard times. Excellent book."
4,This is Adventure...........,"If you like adventure.........this is adventure. The author has a way of placing the reader into the book as if you were a crew member of this hard fought expedition. The crew members become real and the many ordeals that they face hold your attention in a realistic way. You feel you too share in the story and it's hard to predict just what's next. You want to take a trek to Antartica without leaving the comforts of home........read and enjoy this compelling story of high adventure, danger and uncertainty."
5,"Lovely photographs, superb text","It is not very often that a history book can combine thorough research and superb photography to bring to life a truly heroic struggle. ""The Endurance"" achieves just that. The unimaginable hardship and the cruel beauty of the south pole literally jumps off the page and transports the reader.In addition, the book is successful in presenting Shackleton's expedition as a triumph despite the fact that it did not achieve its scientific goals. Without any doubt, this is the definitive account of the last and most heroic expedition of the age of discovery."
3,There are other books out there.,"Not too bad ... But try King, ""Endurance-Shackleton's Last Expedition"" published in 1991 in England, and for that reason virtually unknown in America, for another take on the photos and story."
4,A Must-Read for Penguin Enthusiasts,"Being a big fan of penguins, I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Alexander's magical and wondrous narrative. Penguins are found only at the South Pole, a region in which this book is conveniently set. There's also some bit about a bloke name of Shackleton: rather dull."
5,The Endurance,"Excellent book; well presented with photo's. Difficult to put down. It was recommended by Jeff Masters from Weather Underground and is well worth reading. It is surprising the amount of difficulty that people can experience and survive. It really shows how leadership and discipline, something we lack in our socitey, can be used to assist in goal attainment."
5,Sublime!,"After reading Ernst Shackleton's South, this book is much more enjoyable. Caroline Alexander has done a wonderful job of describing the hardships and day to day activities of the Endurance crew without all of the technical data included in Shacklton's memoir. Frank Hurley's photos are incredible and help to add even more life to the text. This is simply an amazing story of perseverance against incredible odds. The story is guaranteed to fascinate you and the gloss print pictures will leave you in awe."
5,great choice,Chains arrived within 2 days of ordering. I purchased 3 and all came in one tiny gift sack. I was fine with that but you might request separate bags if you need them to be separate gifts. These were going to be used with photo ball lockets that I purchased from a different vendor. They work perfectly with the lockets and are just the right size as far as diameter and length. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
3,Lite Reading,"If someone is going to go to the trouble of writing an autobiography-especially one in which the author announces his homosexuality then the reader would expect some insights and truth seeking. This read more like the author was sitting in the seat next to you on a cross country plane trip. He just keeps talking to make the trip go faster but only lightly touches on various subjects. The fact that I was able to complete this book in one two hour sitting says more about the content than anything else. At the end the main question I had was ""why did he bother""?"
2,Unrelentingly sad...,"This is not a very well written book. It's more like rambling memories. I never heard of Ray Stricklyn before reading this book. He was a want-a-be actor that didn't quite make it, disappated his time and energies and doesn't seem to have done very much at all except that he randomly came in contact with 'names' in show business. The dedication in the book is the best thing in it: 'For all the fine actors who didn't get the opportunities their talents deserved...' I guess Mr. Stricklyn included himself in that. Very sad."
5,Next Best Thing to Being There!,"The author has an amazing account to tell and he does it with great skill -- drawing his reader into the world, not only of primeval jungle and native folklore, but of the vibrant social structure of African life, where a visitor's knowledge of American television shows becomes a better item for trade than a pocketful of gold. As I finished the last, breathtaking chapter (it took every ounce of willpower not to peek ahead to it), I was ready to quit my job, pack up my bags, and set sail to Congo to go looking for the legendary beast myself. What a great read"
4,Well written,"Nugent writes well,has a fun sense of humor,but was very little actual monster searching done, as most of his time was spent tied up in beauracratic red tape. Still I enjoyed the sense of adventure, the culture he spied and shared with us.Over all not a bad read,but not what i had hoped for, in that i wanted more monster action, although it did demonstrate the difficulties an expedition faces or in Mr.Nugent's case, a single man has in achieving the goals of their dreams ."
4,Solid Power Metal Release,"I would say either 3.5 or 4 stars. I like the sound and power of this release and the songs generally are well written. The vocalist is pretty good. Sort of your typical high hitter. There is a slight accent which detracts but not too much. This one is for fans of bands like Helloween,Edguy,Sonata Arctica,Dreamtale."
3,not as expected,"very disappointing. i could not find anywhere in product description that cards were blank. wanted ruled cards. very misleading as this is a christmas gift and no way to make it right in time. will not buy again from this buyer. product quality is great, just mislead about what i was getting."
1,Flimsy cards!,Ordered replacement cards initially and was disappointed that they were so lightweight. Ordered the Card File thinking the supplied cards would be more rigid. Unfortunately not. The cards as so lightweight that it's hard to thumb through them. They are nothing like the older ones I was trying to replace.
4,Sacred Companions: the gift of spiritual friendship & direction,A great used book. Thanks. The book was in very good condition and arrived in the promised amount of time. I appreciate being able to order used books.
5,The Dracula Limited Edition Figures,"l saw this movie (Bram Stoker's Dracula) for the first time in 2010. As a young kid l use to see it on the shelf at Blockbuster all the time and the cover would scare the hell out of me. Years later l decided to watch it and l was instantly in love. The next day l bought it on DVD, and l have the gargoyle from the original cover tattooed on my arm. So l thought as a huge fan l should have the collectible figures.The detail is great, and l can perfectly picture each respective scene from the movie by looking at the figures. The delivery was swift and they came in great shape. l know these collectibles will be in plain view on my mantle for probably my whole life.Jay, Orlando, FL"
4,Very Nice Ring,"This is a very pretty and unique ring, with a seriously satisfying weight to it. I love it and would give it five stars if the garnets weren't more orange then red and if it didnt have a few nicks and scratches on the sides. Beautiful anyways."
3,"A Lesson on the ""value"" of Collectibles","Hands Off! ,from the SpongeBob Pants series by David Lewman is contemporary with a couple of ""faux pax""thrown in,in order to challenge the average kid's attention :1.the mailman carrying a package wrong side up with several of this pieces of mail slipping out of his ""mail bag"";2.SpongeBob's snail ""Gary"" who answers SpongeBob with a response of ""Meow"" when SpongeBob says ""Good night,Gary..."";The illustrations by C. H. Greenblatt & William Reiss are remarkedly fine and ""all's well that ends well"":SpongeBob takes his ""Miracle Man and Barnacle Boy"" out of its original packaging instead of holding on to it as a ""valueless collectible item"" vs being useful as a ""toy""."
1,Disappointing,"As one reviewer has already mentioned, this book is god-awful! I felt like I had learned nothing new, nothing insightful about the program, not even a fun read. In fact, Fred Freidberger's ""All That Glisters"" is more entertaining. And the reviews of each epidode are terrible! Talk about brown-nosing! Even the episodes he doesn't like, he has something good to say! Hopefully, this book will immediately disappear, and demand for it will never come..."
5,Great!!!,This is a great planner to track you pregnancy. The size is perfect to carry with you. The stickers are cute! Only complaint is that the squares a on the small side so you can't write that much.
3,okay,"It would be better if it shows the baby development in each month.I like the size, so I can carry it in my handbag."
2,OK,"I like the fact that this calendar will work anytime. You simply fill in the months/dates. I wish there was more info on what is going on during the weeks of pregnancy though. Ok, but I could have bought a regular pocket calendar for this."
2,CUTE . . . BUT NOT WHAT I WANTED,"THIS ITEM IS CUTE . . . BUT I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN AS MUCH INFO AS POSSIBLE. THIS IS SMALL AND NOT WHAT I WANTED, I GOT A PLANNER INSTEAD AND RETURNED THIS ITEM."
3,Boring,"This is not a great dvd, its very slow and boring. Maybe okay for someone who has never done a bit of yoga before but for most not worth it."
1,Disappointing,"I was expecting something quite provocative when I purchased this DVD. I was VERY disappointed with this video. Sorry, but girl on girl doesn't do it for me. Overall, I give Wet and Wild IX a poor rating. And, as for the male nudity being disturbing, there was none, only a couple of shots of a man's behind. Playboy needs to do more couples videos and/or include more male and female interaction (fantasy/daydream scenes would be great!) in their other videos."
1,Ick,I ordered this stuff through Veganessentials about a year ago and was so psyched to have vegan jerky. Blech. It tasted like overspiced cardboard! It didn't have anything in common with meat jerky. I recommend Primal Strips brand instead; it has the right taste and texture of beef jerky.
4,true tough texture,"I love this jerky. Vegan Dream jerky is very dry and tough with strong flavors. Cowgirl is my favorite, with a nice mix of sweet and spice but there are other flavors that have more heat and/or saltiness.Vegan Drean jerky is very different from Primal Strips mentioned in another review. Primal Strips are more of a typical ""textured soy in sauce"" treat but I also enjoy them.If you want to really CHEW the jerky and tear it apart (can you tell I USED to be a carnivore) - check out Vegan Dream."
1,Not for cats!,"Other reviews said these were good for pet grooming - I should have noticed they all included dogs, not cats. I have 2 Napleons (1/2 munchkin, 1/2 persian) which both have very thick undercoats, and 1 is double-coated. They get mats pretty bad, even with weekly groomings. I bought these to shave through the tough under-coat mats, but they don't even begin to cut through even the smallest of mats! They did cut through non-matted hair reasonably well, but not great in my opinion.If you're looking for a pair clippers that will do well with cats, keep looking - and let me know if you find any!"
4,Great cutter,I purchased this after buying many cheaper makes and models of clippers and happy I finally spent the money on a decent one. The cuts the cats fur like a hot knife through butter. The only thing that is a little bothersome it that it does get hot sort of quick. I need to wait in between animals before I use again and if the cat is being extra squirmy I need to stop for a bit to let it cool.
4,great,"For the price, this product works great. It saves you from having to buy a specialty radio in order to play your Ipod or having to wear headphones if your in a noisy area."
4,Works good,"Yes, it is cheaply made, but as long as you do not abuse it you should have no problems. It has a decent range as well. Many power options, since it can run on USB or the Car adapter. Plenty of channels and you can save them.BTW: Anyone know where the antenna soldiering point is on the board? There is no indicators anywhere. I'm trying to output to an external amplifier for a project."
1,"Hoped for the best, but.....","I had hoped for the best, knowing the quality of these transmitters are questionable. I was right. This unit was terrible. I might as well listen to scratched records."
3,Its was working fine and then poof!,"Got this product as a gift. it worked wonderfully at first. then we started switching between ipods and poof! sorry no more transmits. cant figure out why, the batteries are fine, all the buttons work, even if plugged into car doesnt work."
2,=-/,"its ok,might not be right for my car or something but might work for others and what i get is this annoying sound thats part of the static."
3,usb power?,"Ah,, the instructions are on the package. I had to come back to see what I bought here, which indicates that the unit can run on batteries, 12v auto or USB. It has a USB socket but it is type A. So i would think I need an A to A cable which they don't supply. I'll probly bust my unit before I get it jury-rigged to run off USB. The 12v cable that is obvious for a cigarette lighter has some electronics inside it, so it is stepping the 12v down to what, 3v?UPDATE: I saw a USB A to A cable for 12$. Instead, I spliced the ends of a couple of cables and keeping my fingers crossed, It works!"
3,Fair but simplistic,"Understanding Cloning is a useful book for someone with little to no background in debate about cloning. For someone with a modest knowledge of the issue, there is unfortunately very little new little information in it. That's not to say that the essays themselves aren't engaging and well-written - they certainly are. But it's probably only worth the purchase if you are looking for a primer to begin your study of the issue."
1,Save your cash earned from your own corporate lifestyle.,"The ad in BAM caught my attention to purchase this CD along with a few other local bands. The recording comprises of four songs that are a mismatch of a sad attempt of musical trends, past and present. The awful combination of ska guitar, slap bass, dinosaur drums and novice electronics reveals the untrained hands behind the compositions. Even Silverchair's latest effort is craftier than this. I know the rigors of Indie recording and try to keep up on the local scene. Which leads me to the conclusion of either this band has it together on stage or they don't have it together at all. When cruising the local band bin try going over a letter and picking up The Belvederes latest. It's a collection of the catchy songs you'd never be caught dead with but can't live without."
2,Don't believe the hype,"After reading all the rave reviews for these I thought I just had to have them. When they arrived I anxiously tore the package open expecting to hear a big difference in sound. What I found was an awkwardly big earbud sleve that was a very stiff rubber (almost plasticy)They did not feel right in my ears at all, and the sound was lacking. Maybe it's just my ears but I find that the original gray rubber sleves that my e3s came with is far superior to these in both comfort and sound."
5,I don't own these,but the tips are exactly the same as the earplugs i use for rehearsing. I play really loud rock music and would go deaf fast if i didn't wear them. I actually pulled the tips off my earplugs and put them on my Shure I2C-M Stereo Mobile Headset and they worked like a charm. I cut off the third flange like the suggestions on here and it worked even better.I'm pretty sure you could find black tips if you just search for noise-canceling earplugs and then take them off and use them on your headphones. They usually run around $12.
4,Good option for E3c.,The small size fits my ear perfectly. I wanted a second set for the E3c earphones that I purchased.
3,Takes Some Getting Used to...,"I can't stand shoving these things into my ears but my Shure E3s sound MUCH better than the regular earbuds and it's more convenient than the big bulky headphones. As for these sleeves, to me, they are more comfortable than the ones that come with the product, but I can't say that it'll be the same for everyone. Also, a dab of water in each ear helps them slide in more easily."
1,Surprisingly bad - until mod,"I just tried them with my E3c's and was surprised by how bad the sound was. Lost all bass -- like listening to my music in a tin can! However, they did stay in my ear better, but who cares?!--UPDATE--I've added 2 stars after taking some scissors and cutting off the top flange and shorting the stem at the other end. Seems to fit better and I got some of the bass back."
1,For Shure ONLY,"I was looking for replacement triple flange eartips for my Monster Turbine Pro in-ear speakers and mistakeningly thought these would work. Although they look like the ones that came on the Turbines, they will not work."
2,Not as good as the reviews say,I tried these flanges based on all of the positive reviews but I found them to be very painful. I went with the foam attachments and was much happier. I travel on very long flights so these were just horrible and made my ears hurt after 30 minutes. The foam ones I could leave in for 14+ hours.
4,You can cut them,these were way too long for my ears - but like the instructions say they can be cut - I lopped off the smallest flange at the tip and a bit off the back and they fit PERFECT. Easily done with a pair of scissors. give that a shot if you think they don't fit right.
1,Lousy,Hurt my ears. I even followed the directions to customize them. Had to throw them away as they hurt so much.
4,close to perfect,The shure triple flange tips are near perfect except i had to modify it for my westone 3.Modification in that i had to cut the stem about two mm shorter. They isolate better that the foam tips in my opinion but the are less comfortable than the foamies. also u loose a little detail and sparkle but not that much at all.
5,Great fit,The biggest issue i've had with earphones have always been my oddly shaped ears.When I got my new Shure SE215 earphones they came with a lot of different adapters and I tried all of them but none would either stay in place or create that seal you need to hear the full potential of these phones.These adapters are amazing and the fit is perfect for both staying in place and the creating the seal for the full sound experience and noise isolation.
4,Invasive but unbeatable,"I use these with Westone earphones. I have deep ears and comply/shure foams just don't provide the seal needed. If you have not used this type of tip before, it will seem to be quite invasive and possibly uncomfortable at first. Expect to see some deep ear wax come out with them occasionally.You can trim the stalk on these down a bit which can help if they are too long and you want to get the IEM closer in your ear hole.Note that the first few times putting these in, they will be a little uncomfortable and sticky. Once they get a little bit of oil/wax on them (not chunks) they will slide in and out much easier. I have to aim mine UP a bit when i put them in.They are expensive, but if you are buying these, you probably already have headphones in the $150+ range, so you understand that nothing comes cheap in the high end audio world."
2,Cheap...don't buy it!!,Its really cheap. It looks so much nicer on the web then in person. REALLY disappointed and the shipping is way too expensive.
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP,This is good maybe for a kid who is collecting business cards. But for a professional it is crap. Cheap plastic cover....
2,Bad Recordings its not remastered,"I love Ike and Tina turner but stay away from this set, so you don,t waste $21.49 like I did. First off the recordings ARE NOT remastered they are takin off of LPs and various other sources and the book is basically photos of album covers. If I knew this sounded that bad I would not have wasted the money."
2,Hurst shifter linkage,"The product would be what is expected, if the product would have been shipped with all the correctly manufactured parts. One of the linkage tab holes was never drilled nor was the end of the tab properly rounded and formed to allow the use of the part. Since time is of the essence and returns are a pain with awaiting reships, I had to suck it up and do the best I could, with what was provided, do to a lack of proper quality control."
2,faulty carriage return,The Brother HL-1250 monochrome laser printer works great up to one point. The carriage in the laser printer is susceptible to breaking if the paper gets jammed or is too thick like in card stock. It can break. It broke once under warranty; it broke a second time outside of warranty.
5,first songs my kids clapped for,"My boys get so excited when we play this CD. Fortunately, it is very easy for adults to listen to as well. There are a couple tracks on this CD - everytime we here them my 18 month old applauds."
5,Engaging performer/songwriter,"We first saw Justin at the CD opening party for Yellow Bus. His performance is the most engaging experience for both parent and child and guarenteed to make you a fan. His music is light-hearted, humerous and will invokes your child's imagination, yet is simple enough for kids to join in. You can tell he is still a kid at heart, with a great ear for music. We own both CDs and anxiously await #3."
5,Great reliable tool,"This tool sells for more , Amazon has the best pricequality is very good , its a good workhorse very useful ."
2,"Yes, disappointing.","I too was disappointed with this book. I am a full-time mother, so I could not relate to her perspective as a ""dual-career"" mom. Much of what she wrote about was just not helpful, and I really can't imaging it being helpful for a ""working"" mom either. I cannot recommend this book."
1,"High on entertainment value, low on culinary content.","I am a new college grad trying to learn how to cook for myself. After picking up a copy of this book, I found that it did a better job of entertaining and glorifying his show than it did teaching people how to cook. The receipes are fine, but there is little explanation or technique involved. There are also many pictures of Emeril entertaining his TV audiences. If you are a die hard Emeril fan, you might like this book for its entertainment value. If you want to learn to cook for yourself, you might get frustrated with the lack of technical content. If the latter is true, order a cook book by someone who is also a master culinary educator as well as a master chef. Unfortuntately, all of Emeril's books seem to be like this one. I guess that it is safe to say that even though Emeril is popular on TV, his books may not be the best to learn from. He may be entertaining and hip, but he is definately NO Julia Child!!"
3,The hype overshadows the recipes.,"I highly recommend Emeril's ""Louisiana Real & Rustic"", but find the ""super hype format"" of this book to be obnoxious. As for the New York Times, they dislike Emeril, because he challenges the low-fat, low-flavor, dogma of the cooking elite. (I don't recommend the Emeril recipes posted on the Food TV web site, due to significant accuracy problems that I have had with them.)"
4,Not too exciting - just DELICIOUS food!,"Although the book has a few too many irrelevant pictures of his staff, rather than the dishes prepared, virtually every recipe in the book will have you drooling in anticipation. The recipes are easy enough to follow, and I've had nothing but incredible results. The recipe for his Essence was a bonus - I'm using it on everything now!"
2,Does Not Kick It Up A Notch For Me,"I was frankly quite disappointed with this cookbook as it seemed moreabout Emeril than it was his food. I found the chapter breakdowndifficult to follow, and the few recipes I tried were adequate atbest. As [an] Italian Food Host.., I have over 300cookbooks in my collection, and this is one of the few I am sorry Ibought. Unless you are a huge fan of Emeril's, I'd advise you not towaste your money on this book."
1,Good ol Emeril,"I love cooking. It is a true hobby for me. Nothing is more fun than getting together a few friends and putting on a dinner party. As a result, I have bought a lot of cookbooks. Knowing this, some friends have given me some of Emerils books. I have seen him on TV, but never really caught on to what was so special about him. I have tried his recipes from his books. some have turned out okay, but none were 'out of this world'. What I have found is that Emeril does like to have fun with his cooking. That is great. But I have to disagree that his cooking 'aint rocket science here'. His recipes can be very time consuming and expensive. They are not for the average or novice cook. For people who love cooking, I would recommend other cookbooks that have easier to follow recipes, more pictures of the food itself, and far less self-promotion."
2,Missing info,"Although I've only made one dinner from the book, the recipe I chose was inaccurate. There were steps missing in the directions and it forced me to guess. If I had followed the directions as printed, the dish would not have been fully cooked. This book needed to be proof-read a little better."
1,"Better Luck Next Time, Emeril!","What a disappointment! I've enjoyed his show and thought this would be a great first cookbook (of his) to add to my extensive collection. Not to Be! Recipies just didn't work and I'm an experienced cook! I actually tore out the pages with his spice blends to save, and tossed the rest. No point in taking up shelf space! The three recipies I tried failed to pass my taste test and the others didn't even sound good. Just because a dish has weird proportions or exotic ingredients doesn't make it innovative or unique from a culinary standpoint!! After all the purpose of cooking is to make something that TASTES good!!!"
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I didn't like this book at all. Emeril is not a genius. He might be a fair cook, but he isn't a genius. This book was nothing but a bunch of pictures of him. The recipes were less than average. I may try to return it."
4,"Very good cookbook - captures the ""Essence"" of Emeril","I've had this book for nearly a year now, and am not disappointed inthe least. I've made several of the dishes in this book, as well asdishes from his show...and all have turnedout to be delicious. Try the Delmonico Chicken or Shrimp Creole. Thedishes take time and preparation, and some take practice and will bebetter the second time you make it, but they are excellent. Onedownside is that, for me in the Midwest, a lot of the fish/shellfishingredients aren't readily available.I wholeheartedly recommendthis book for the cooks out there who are adventurous and willing toexperiment. You will enjoy it. Those who are more at home withmacaroni and cheese from a box, stay away."
2,Not Impressed,"I purchased this book because I love to cook Emeril's recipes...but was very disappointed. I love to see photos of the food I am going to make, rather than photos of the chef and people I do not know. I also did not like the layout of the book, for example he would put a title of a dish and talk about it on one page, and have the recipe on the next page. I think out of the entire book I will probably make 4 dishes. I would not spend my money on it, but would download his recipes from the Food TV website instead."
4,BOW WOW WONDERFUL,"Four classic Little Rascals episodes starring Petey!1)""For Pete's Sake"" (Wally offers to trade Pete to a bully.)2)""Dogs Is Dogs"" (Spud falls in a well, Pete ends up in the pound!)3)""The Pooch"" (Uh-oh!

1,It is a disappointment,"The order came quickly, but it was a disappointment! After I charged the product for 24 hours, it is still too weak to brush between the gum and the inside cheek. It is a total waste of money!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"I rarely write reviews, but I felt misled by the other review available for this book. The review is both well-written and encouraging. Unfortunately the same can't be said for Ms. Berzon's book. It's full of relationship clichés familiar to anyone who has watched daytime TV in the past 15 years, ""alcohol can affect your sex life,"" ""self-esteem issues can lead to infidelity."" There are a few gay cliches to distinguish this from the trite of the self-help books available for straights, ""gay men are less likely to assume that monogamy is an integral part of committed relationship"" etc. These are not exact quotes, but they're accurate enough. Read the sample pages available here. The book doesn't get any more insightful. I'm sure we're all intrigued by the possibility that we may only be touching the surface of our relationship potential, but this book isn't going to help you."
3,good not great,"the format of this book is some advice from betty berzon (author) backed up with related examples from her counseling career and her personal ltr. this book touches on different areas of gay life but doesn't seem to nail down any real suggestions for improvement and the book left me feeling unfulfilled. maybe i was expecting too much, i think the problem is that the book isn't very focused. i did pick up some good advice but it took me a while to get through the book."
5,Counseling in a book,If you would like to work out your long-term relationship then I would suggest that you give this book a try.It really opens your eyes/mind to things that you would never think about.
4,Good condition,"The book is used and obviously has some wear and tear. Despite that, the condition of the book is pretty good! I was satisfied with this purchase."
2,So much potential...and then the socialism creeps in,"The premise of this book is great; discussing the over-consumption by many Americans. It really does a good job of making you think about all of the junk that you have accumulated during your life, and asking yourself ""Why?"" It really makes you want to simplify your life. Unfortunately, the book is ruined by all of the liberalism it promotes. At one point, there is discussion of Marxism in a positive light. It is hard for me to wrap my arms around a book that would promote such a thing. The book seems to suggest that the government should be involved in reducing Americans consumption. I am in agreement that we must reduce our waste and over-consumption, but it must be a personal choice. That is what is known as freedom. The book loses me as I am sure that it will other readers when it encourages socialist, or even communist views."
4,I wanted it to be better...,"I love the concept of this book, and think it sheds light on a very important epidemic in our society. However, I have to agree with other reviewers that while the idea of Affluenza might have been revolutionary when the show was first aired, in 2007 the book just tells you a lot of stuff that - if you're tuned into the world - you probably already know.Despite the fact that there isn't anything really groundbreaking in this book, I think it provides a lot of insights into a serious American problem (that we're exporting all over the world), and is a nice, easy read."
5,Affluenza,"Without being ""preachy"" this book clearly illustrates some of the absurdities of industrialized and advanced technology life, and how we need to kick our addiction to ""more"" and ""bigger"". It illustrates how we have all been victims of mass marketing, and the price we are paying because of it. A must read for everyopne, not just the ecologically tuned in."
5,"History, facts and insights are pointed and revealing messages addressing the modern condition.","The second edition of AFFLUENZA: THE ALL-CONSUMING EPIDEMIC will reach new audiences who might have missed one of the best nonfiction title nominees of 2001, providing updated details and healthy alternatives to the consumer oriented 'epidemic' of modern times. From shopaholics and bankruptcies to those seeking meaning in material goods, AFFLUENZA details the process of recovery from physical and cultural clutter, and offers both personal and political remedies for the problem. History, facts and insights are pointed and revealing messages addressing the modern condition.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,My opinion about the Affluenza,I think it is a very interesting and well written book about important issues of the life in America. It contains funny illustrations.
1,I Wonder If That Soapbox Is Ancient-Forest Wood,"I was very much looking forward to recieving this title from Amazon.com after reading the first few pages online. And, admittedly, I did like the first few chapters; however, the tone and style of presentation changed very quickly, and became almost smug and self-aggrandizing. The authors seemed far too pleased with themselves, and, by approximately the halfway point I felt as if I were reading some kind of bizzare Conservationist Manifesto. I like to think - as a self-appointed conservationist and vegan - that I try to mind Mother Nature and all living creatures, but after I finished reading this repetitive, pedantic bore, I lost the will to care. Maybe I am being too harsh, but this book seemed to peak in the first chapter; then, it became exasperatingly preachy and redundant. Others liked the book, and that's fine; But I was disappointed."
4,Affluenza Review,"I purchased ""Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic"" in the beginning of September, as I needed it for a Consumer Behavior Marketing course I am currently taking. Although the book was purchased for educational purposes, I recommend it to everyone who wants a humble and realistic view on how the over consumption of goods is changing our world economically, environmentally, physically, emotionally and mentally. The book is written to be more of a ""joy read"", but includes statistics and factual information that justifies the story that is told throughout the book's entirety. It is a fast and compelling read that I would suggest to anyone who wants to improve their consumer mentality and understand the effects of the shopping habits we have grown so accustomed to in our society.Affluenza: The All-Consuming Epidemic (Bk Currents)"
5,affluenza,definitely helped me with purchasing stuff i don't need. i think back to this book as a reason not to buy unnecessary products. i highly recommend this book to shopaholics. :)
4,Japanese express,"This the equivalent of Mario Batali for Italian cooking: there is nothing wrong with it but you are left with the feeling that there is a higher cuisine than this. Pictures are great, recipes are short but you are sufficiently informed. And it would be hard to resist the author's smile.What I cooked was good and I found the ingredients easily despite the fact that I live in small town GA. Plus it is healthy. Plus, it does not take too much time. Almost perfect.What more do I want? More culture, I guess, I like heavy books with an access to the culture, such asThe Japanese KitchenAnd I love to find a few divine things in a cookbook.Well deserved four stars, don't mind me."
5,Great Gift,"This was purchased as a gift for a friend who is an amazing chef. He had not ventured into Japanese cooking very often but wanted to. This book made it easy for him to follow the directions, while still adding his own flare to the dishes. He said it would be a good one for people that are not as adept at cooking as he is...very easy to understand and make the recipes happen."
4,Good Ideas but....,"This cookbook has some great ideas and I will probably try making one or two recipes in it. It is not an traditional Japanese cuisine cookbook. Its like saying that all of Martha Stewart's recipes are traditional American cuisine. All of Harumi's recipes have quality ingredients and the book explains any new or different cooking techniques quite well, but most of the recipes are not something I really want to eat. It is a good book and its not Harumi's fault that I dont like a lot of ingredients she uses. I do think it was worth the price since I love looking at cookbooks to get new ideas for cooking. I may not use very many recipes from her book, but it does give me good ideas for influencing my home cooking."
3,Flawed Book,"I have many Asian cookbooks, but this is the first one I know of that uses unfamiliar terms without explaining them. Worse, the book has no index. It has a glossary, but it is quite short. One recipe calls for an ingredient called ""shokoshu"", without further explanation. None of my five other reputable Japanese cookbooks refer to this ingredient, and even google had a hard time telling me that its something as simple as a form of Shaoxing wine. The same recipe called for ""Chinese Soup Paste or a mix of chicken and beef stock"", and I still don't know what that paste is, though at least in this case I a have a clue about how it should taste.I think the book production team had the book translated, but then failed to do the rest of the job - make it useful to a foreign audience. I will still try the recipes, but I don't like being made to work so hard to do so."
4,wonderful cookbook for beginners,"one of my favorite cookbooks of all time namely because there exists glossy, full color photos on each page (and i guess because the food tastes pretty damn great, too). recipes are laid out in simple and easy to follow terms."
4,Hard Core,This is the Japanese form of hard rock. This band is he kind of rock band that is needed in the world. This cd has some nice sounds and trippin melodies. A must buy for rock lovers.
5,Glay-U always is the BEST-!!!!!!!,"The album'song all i like,like HEAVY GAUGE,FATSOUNDS,BE WITH U,WINTER AGAIN,LEVEL DEVIL,HAPPINESS,WILL BE KING,and all the song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The song in this album i very very like is BE WITH U,WINTER AGAIN,HAPPINESS,HEAVY GAUGE........because the song is very very best!!!!!!!wat character would u like in GLAY?i would like all,but the one i very very like is HISASHI,because i like his hair design,fashion design,lips,..........HISASHI IS THEV COOL ONE..............."
3,A-OK,"The product didn't arrive in the packaging pictured in the description, but that's neither here nor there to me. I actually think I may have gotten more catnip in my bag, than in the one shown.My cat was never really very sensitive to catnip, and he always seemed like he could take it or leave it. I was hoping this would inspire the zen-like rolling and blissed-out scampering that I've seen my other cats enjoy in the past. I don't think it was the product's fault that this in fact, did not happen. I think I just have a cat that cat nip has a negligible effect on."
2,Poor Quality Catnip,Very little response from cats or kittens to this product as compared to some fresh I grew last year (it is a weed and grows easily). I will not purchase again. Shipping and packaging were good.
3,"Oolong Tea, ok, if you keep this in mind","I've always loved oolong tea, but live in an area where it's black tea, or green tea if you're lucky and that's it. I saw the oolong on Amazon and the price on this particular brand was excellent. I ordered 10 boxes. The company shipped very quickly. The tea itself is good IF you don't let it brew too long. Don't let it turn a rich shade of brown or it will be too bitter. After several tries, I finally found just the right amount of time and water and am pleased w/the taste. It might take a little experimentation, but don't give up after the first cup if you don't like it. Try again and it should work out. Supposedly oolong is good for the complexion, digestion and weight control..........we'll see about that. In any case, when brewed properly, the taste is fine and the cost is very good especially compared to the other brands listed."
4,Enjoying reading it,I am presently reading this book and enjoying it quite a lot. It describes the author's experiences as a rower.
2,Horrible Repair Service,"The camera is great. Small, easy to use, great lens, and fine pictures. My complaint is with Panasonic service.After a couple of years, the sensor or something went, rendering the camera useless. Following instructions, I sent the camera to their service center. Got the camera back in a few weeks. THE CAMERA WAS IN EXACTLY THE SAME INOPERABLE CONDITION AS IT WAS WHEN I SENT IT IN TO BE REPAIRED. I phoned them, and was unable to speak with anyone responsible. Finally I received a return sticker. Returned the camera. I just got a new bill charging me for another repair on the same camera for the same money I paid in the first place. It is impossible to speak to anyone on the phone who can resolve a problem. I sent copies of all documents back to them and now await some kind of reply. DO NOT BUY PANASONIC IF YOU EXPECT ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE REGARDING REPAIRS."
4,"Pretty good for the price, definitely not an SLR replacement...","This camera does what it says it does: it takes 16:9 pictures and video at 10.2MP for pictures and OK resolutions for video. It takes decent video, if you put it on a tripod. The built-in stabilization is worthless in video mode and you'll get a palsy type shaking no matter what you do. In other words, this will not replace your camcorder. In picture mode, it does a good job with most outdoors/indoors settings if you're not too picky about the lens distortions around the corners at the highest resolution. This is especially obvious if you take pictures where vertical objects appear near the left or right edges of the frame (like stop signs, light posts, building edge lines etc.)All in all, a decent buy for home use. Not something to look into if you'll be frequently printing your pictures for posterity or for use in professional publications."
4,"Overall excellent quality, but a few issues","Overall, this is an excellent camera. The quality is great for something in the ""ultra-compact"" category. However, the lens juts out about 1"" from the camera body, which I was unaware of and makes the camera a lot less portable. I'm still not sure if the price justifies the feature set, but I'm fairly satisfied. Very happy that grid and histogram options are available. There are also a lot of preset ""automatic"" modes, which are very nice."
5,Awesome camera!!,"Greatest feature on this camera is the 16:9 shooting mode. I'm very surprised that other company's haven't provided this option yet. Besides that, this is an awesome camera to shoot with. Shutter speeds up to 500th of a second to capture fast action! Brilliant!"
2,Panasonic Disaster,"I only found out after I bought it that the 10.2 MP rating was only applicable when the camera was used with the lens set in wide angle form, the self timer never work properly, and the thing died on me unexpectedly after less than a years use. I had thought when I bought it that it was going to be a great little camera because it had a Lieca lens and the zoom range was excactly what I'd been looking for. But this was my first digital camera and I obviously made a poor choice."
3,panasonic versus sony,"The camara is ok and have a lot of posibilities, its not a point and shoot.Pros. you can do nearly everything that you can do with a canon or nikon lens camaras. the anti shake.Cons. Lens cap, popup flash, pics nearer than 2 feets to object not clear in all sectionsI have a sony DSC-P10 it does nearly the same but faster, no lens cap and has automatic flash, pics near 1 feet or less OK"
2,if you are looking for wide - be careful,1. If you have tons of cataloged pictures in the 3:2 aspect and don't want to start collecting 16:9's2. And you are looking for a small P&S; with full control AND WIDE LENSread this camera's test in the November popular photography and you will realize that this camera is only 28mm in the 16:9 aspectIf you collect 3:2's you will be buying something like 33mm in the wide end
3,A disappointment,"There are good things to say about this camera (you'll find them in the other reviews), but unfortunately a noisy sensor, limited dynamic range, and very noticeable barreling at the wide end spoil what could be a really dynamite little camera."
3,A decent point and shoot with good usability,I bought this point and shoot to supplement my Nikon D50 while traveling. Overall it is a very capable digital camera with the following pluses:(+) great lcd(+) 16/9 sensor format(+) usable controls(+) ability to shoot rawand some minuses:(-) noise and details(-) tendency to overexpose(-) color shift (red becomes magenta) when very contrastyIn short it's not as good as a DSLR (by far) but it makes for a good substitute if you don't want to haul expensive glass.
5,Continues to be the best small digital camera I've ever owned,"I've used the Canon Powershots, great cameras, but I love all the manual features this camera offers. 16x9 aspect ratio is another huge selling point for me.I owned the DMC-LX1 before this model and I upgraded simply for the 10 megapixels.This camera can be as easy or as complicated as you want - set to auto and it's really just point and shoot for beautiful pictures every time. Use the manual features and really go nuts. I can't say enough great things about it.Other small cameras will slide in/out of a pocket a little easier than this one because the lens protrudes but it's a very small thing to deal with for what you get in exchange. I don't think anyone would regret buying this camera."
5,Great Camera,"If you take all of your pictures in auto mode, than this is not a camera for you! I agreed there are some noise problem, but you can overcome this problem easily with different manual setting or shooting in raw. You might have to do some editing in photoshop or using the software that came with this camera to reduce the noise on the picture. I'm glad that I made the purchase without holding back about the noise problem, and I LOVE this camera."
3,A little disappointed,"This video was not what I expected, a little outdated but it is good for my lazy days and gives me a change from my kickboxing every now and then. Unfortunately I was impressed by this workout, I wish they would have more moves to keep it interesting."
4,The Real Thing,"Although these exercises look simple, they are the real thing if you want to train for strength and chi. I have trained in Kung Fu for almost 40 years, I know Mike Marshall personally and have met Donald several times. Both are excellent martial artists and both have trained with Buck Sam Kong who is a master in Hung Gar Kung Fu. Hung Gar, in my opinion, is perhaps the best overall art available."
3,fiery force,I have seen bits and pieces of this video on youtube.com and it's not too bad but to make the exercises more difficult add on some more skills to your training to this video by using some body weights. I recommend using Kung Fu iron rings with 10 rings on each arm and you can order them from [...] from Rick Tew that are 3 pounds a piece. I can tell by these exercises they are based on Hung Gar Kung Fu also to make it even more difficult get some hand weights from [...] along with Kung Fu Iron RIngs at the same time and from there some 10 pound ankle weights on each ankle and some weighted shorts while in the horse stance and a weighted vest as well then follow the exercises in this video and you will for sure be ready to work up a sweat compared to not using body weights like they do in this movie. Kung Fu means hard work and hard accomplishment and it's always about making things more difficult!
5,Raveled Ends of Sky is a must read!,"Linda Sandifer has captured the true pioneer adventure west. Well researched, developed and written, her characters will linger in your mind and heart long after you finish the book. So be sure to climb aboard the wagon train and hold on tight. You're in for great ride!"
3,"Fun, but not consistent quality","This is a fun toy and our daughter (12 months) really enjoyed watching the dogs run around chasing the ball. The melody is also very catchy. Unfortunately, the action of the dogs sometimes works and sometime doesn't. We thought it was the battery at first, but after replacing it, we noticed the inconsitent performance continued. I guess that for the price, it is worth it."
2,I returned it,"My old rolodex autodex finder I loved. When I replaced it with this new one it just didn't work well at all. I couldn't get it to slide down the side to the different letters of the alphabet and the cards were bent, just not well made."
1,rolodex autodex,This product is extremely poor. If you at Amazon . com want to offer a decent product you must stop offering this product.
1,Cheap,"Like the other reviewers, I was looking for a new telephone directory to replace my old metal one that was filled up and had lots of crossed out addresses from changes I had made. But this is cheap plastic, the tab sticks, it bends the papers, and often won't bring up the right letter. I prefer the flat ones to the larger round ones, but I might not have a choice. Shame."
2,"Nice try, but no cookie","I bought this as a replacement for a vintage rolodex. I was disppointed when I received this one because it was fairly small and did not have enough room to put a person's name, address, phone numbers, etc. The vintage one was much more useful, just falling apart. This one also seemed a bit flimsy and am not sure if it will come in handy."
3,overall operation,I have problems with the moveable tab ! It seems to stick thus getting the wrong address letter page card that I want!
1,poor quality,product is a bust-- not well made- hard to operate --returned to seller--seller service was excellent despite inferior product
3,rolodex list finder,The rolodex listfinder is handy for quick lookup but the slide on the side tends to stick and damage the cards. It suits my needs for numbers I need quickly.
5,"Tu et nul autre, pour jamais","This is a fantastic book. I read in 1984 when it came out and I must have read it 10 times since then. I love the banter between Aimee & St. Briac and how she drives him to distraction with her crazy schemes. I like to think of this book as a historical romance with a comedy of errors on the side. St. Briac is one of my favorite romantic heroes. I even copied their wedding bands for my wedding. ""Tu et nul autre, pour jamais"". I just can't say enough good things about this book! Can't wait to re-read it again next year."
4,Pretty Good,"I would have given this one five stars but for the lead female character. I lost patience with her often. She is virtually spineless and seems always on the verge of or in tears. Plus, I really hated her reaction (including the final one) to Ghilsane. Really? It was totally unrelatable. And, so was she. It just felt like she was looking for the male hero to be her daddy. Otherwise, a nice read."
4,If you like to look at Morrissey---you'll love this book.,"I would give the book a higher rating, but some of the information is very U.K. oriented and so I felt lost when it talked about certain artistic influences Morrissey had. Great layout and idea behind the book---it looks at Morrissey's choices in art direction throughout his music career (how he picked LP photos, EP photos, merchandise photos, etc.). Nice irony in calling it ""the art of Morrissey"" because most people might take that to mean his music...not actually ""art"" Nice big color phots make it a cool ""loohthrough"" book"
5,wow,"prolly one of the best, least known punk acts to come out about the same time as nirvana..... Mostly ignored and forgotten now les thugs carried on the punk tradition in word and spirit in the 90's. Maybe the finest moment of what could be called the ""never has beens"" for a band who truely lived what they sang. Like Social Distortion and X before them most who heard them formed bands........No one reads these reviews guys good bye to a time......"
2,Good gift for budding cross stitcher,"The designs in this very slim book are very basic and few; more suitable for a beginner,since they are not overwhelming in the least. My ten year old daughter seemed to like working with this book a lot. The simple designs include a cornflower,silverweed,chicory,poppy,tufted vetch,foxglove and a few others. My favorite project was the flower panel shown on the cover which is as complicated as it gets in this book; Shirley Watt's ""Flowers in Cross Stitch"" is more appropriate for higher skill levels."
2,Doesn't push all the way down,"It worked fairly well and seems faster with the side holes, but after going metal to metal, there was still about 1/4 inch left in the bowl part. The piston didn't push down far enough. With some metal bending I could get it to go far enough, but most people don't have a tool shop available. I might check out one of the fancier kitchen stores to see if they have better ones but for now I'm experimenting and just needed a basic, simple ricer.Other than that problem, it works well and fast to produce the ""ricer"" textured potatoes (or steamed cauliflower or boiled eggs).I haven't had it that long but it seems sturdy enough."
2,Poor Design,"I bought one at the local Shopko and am here looking for a better one. I rice pototoes hot as needed for making lefse, and hot water and juice squirts out the holes in the side all over me and the work area. I haven't had a chance to damage it, because its dangerous to use with hot potatoes, and thats what I need.Its going back."
4,It was good.,"I agree with my man above, it was well anticipated but not as good as the first album. It needed more songs like Awesome God, Deliver, Garment of Praise etc. The songs didn't catch my attention like the first album. Don't get me wrong, the choir is still awesome and they have a wonderful sound, but this is harsh but true. When James Hall made albums they got better and better each time, they need to keep that same concept."
2,Not as good as the UK Special Edition,"Despite the excellent transfer on MGM's version, the UK release is miles better and includes 2 audio commentaries (from director and production team; and historical consultant Stephen Walters; PLUS a 50 minute ""making of"" documentary.) It's been released in England by a company called Sanctuary (???)and although amazon.co.uk says it's PAL it's actually NTSC multi-region. I ordered one from amazon in England and the disc plays perfectly on my U.S. Sony player. If you're a fan of this movie (as I am) then this is the version for you."
4,"The Bounty - OK, But!","The movie had a lot of stars in it. Liam Neeson, who's acting ability really showed thru. Daniel Day-Lewis, who I thought was a little stiff in this roll. He didn't seem to fit in. Mel Gibson was really good in this movie. His character had to go thru alot of changes and he seemed to be able to do that smoothly. Anthony Hopkins was great as always. He acted out the nice guy part and the bad guy part seemlessly. I love the music in this film, especially the music over the ending credits. I was greatly dissapointed when I found out that the music faded out at the end of the credits. On the VHS version not only does it go thru the entire song, it also has an extension on the end of the song. I expected the DVD to have the same. However I recommend the movie to anyone who is a Anthony Hopkins fan, like me.(...)"
4,Quite a great tale!,"The story is a grand one and it is well done in this movie. With a very talented cast it's hard to go wrong here. The cinematography is very awe-inspiring. I just loved this movie and another not-so-well-known ""Rapa Nui"". I think it should be rated PG-13, however, for it's topless nudity scenes, done National Geographic style...in other words, not in bad taste. It adds to the realism, if you ask me.I just can't understand why amazon.com will not make available the HiFi version of ""The Bounty"" on VHS and it just floors me that of all the ""junk"" out on DVD, that a title such as this with it's awesome cast isn't yet available on DVD! I will wait till the cows come home for the DVD version. Amazon, do you hear me?"
1,I'm Still Owed A Refund,"I bought this video from Amazon but on receiving the film found the picture to be black & white. So I took advantage of Amazon's 'returns policy'. This was back in July 2003, but I still have not been refunded. Amazon did tell me I had been credited with the amount owed & could access this by buying another product (even although by British law they legally had to reimburse me in the way I originally payed for the product (by cheque)). When I tried to use said credit I found Amazon would not release it as they seemed to have no knowledge of the credit. What is happening Amazon?"
1,Mutiny on this Movie! - [ 1 star is too many],"I was very disappointed after watching this sad, sad, sad interpretation of the glorious Mutiny on the Bounty and find it difficult to believe that so many people gave this movie 4 plus stars. Given the actors and the storyline, I had much higher expectations and was genuinely let down by this shallow rendition. After sitting through all the bad screenwriting, over dramatic acting by Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson and Liam Neeson, and all the long drawn out/miscued pauses, not to mention the psychopathic music accompanying each badly acted, over dramatic scene, I wanted to toss the DVD, DVD player, and television overboard - actually off my balcony."
4,Notice - This tape is recorded in LP and isn't HIFI Stereo,"This is a very good film. It deserves to be experienced with a better quality recording than this. To fit it onto a T-120 tape (the film is 130 minutes) it's been recorded at the lower quality LP speed. Many VCRs won't even play at this speed (mine won't, check yours before ordering it). And it is not stereo hifi but standard mono VHS. Do yourself a favor and bug Amazon to get the SP HiFi version!"
4,A beautifully filmed epic.,"I must disagree with some of the other reviews in that I feel this movie contains some terrific acting by some very young (and now quite famous) stars. Daniel Day lewis gives a fine performance as a sniveling ""dandy"" type officer as does Liam Neeson in one of his earlier, lesser known roles. Mel Gibson's performance is quite solid, especially in the actual scene where the crew mutinies. (I don't know what film the others were watching, but this scene was anything but wooden!) As usual, Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as the stiff and stoic Captain Bligh. The Bounty is, among other things, a romantic story that not only educates, but entertains at the same time. Being a big fan of the novel, the screenplay, although not always perfect, still holds the flavor of the original written work. If you like historical epics, you'll enjoy this movie."
4,Classic,"I wasn't very thrilled back in 1984 at the age of 14 when I went to see this movie with my family on a Friday night. However, I was instantly impressed with the music and very much enjoyed the movie. I recently watched the 1962 version and also enjoyed that, with the exception of the ending. The 1984 movie ending was so much more powerful in my opinion. Also, as I mentioned before, the 1984 soundtrack is amazing. The recording quality of the soundtrack leaves much to be desired, but the music itself is outstanding. Overall, a very solid movie."
3,Essential for fans of the mutiny story but choppy continuity and overly ambitious,"This version offfers a much more sympathetic view of Bligh than either the 1962 Brando/Howard version or the 1935 Gable/Laughton version. Apparently, this is much closer to the historical truth. Excellent performances by Hopkins as Bligh and Gibson as Christian. Choppy continuity though, since the Robert Bolt script was originally to be the basis of a two-part film directed by David Lean. The movie contains a section on Bligh's legendary 3,900 mile open boat voyage following the mutiny. Main flaw of film: it tries to cover too much ground in a couple of hours.Highly recommended for fans of this legendary story of British Navy discipline overcome by a period of lax, idyllic Tahitian paradise. Bligh's big mistake: letting all discipline dissolve while the crew was on Tahiti for many months during the period necessary for the breadfruit to grow. Read the recent book by Caroline Alexander for the details."
5,Tragic Story,"I was happy to discover this movie was quite accurate. The acting superb. The reality of Christian's actions tragic, especially considering his early demise as told by the sole remaining man on Pitcairn."
4,performances carry this film,"After viewing this film a couple of times in its DVD format, I asked myself, ""Did Anthony Hopkins adequately portray Captain Bly's transition from cofident and caring sea captain to driven duty bound maniac?!"" I still can't come up with an answer. In the space of two hours, Hopkins has to convince us of this transition, and it's a hard call to make. On the other hand, I watched Mel Gibson in a performance from twenty years ago (1983) and I was amazed at his versatility and subtlety. He is outstanding in his role as Fletcher Christian. He is thorougly convincing in his transition from London Bon Vivant (lover of fine wine and living) to love sick South Pacific/Polynesian convert. I felt sad for Gibson because his most recent portrayals involve confident heroic characters whom lack the sensitivity of the Fletcher Christian character portrayal. Over-all, this is a well paced film that offers a colorful contrast to the 1950's version starring Marlon Brando."
5,Definitely the best telling of the story,"After muddling through the original ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and Brando's version, I am nicely satisfied at this fresh outlook on the story. Now, I am a big fan of classic movies, but sometimes I think they are too dated to be more than a period piece. The Laughton/Gable version, while full of great actors, doesn't cut it with me: plastic ships in bathtubs, pirates with 30's American accents, and white girls with blackface makeup trying to look polynesian don't work. ""The Bounty,"" on the other hand, strikes me as exciting, dramatic, fresh, tense and sexy (they definitely did the Tahiti scenes well). Besides, who could complain about Gibson, Hopkins and Neeson in one movie? I also agree that that soundtrack is hauntingtly effective. A very good film."
3,"Bountiful enough, but only barely.","The director of this film had a fine cast at his command, and an alternately witty and sensitively intelligent script to place them in, which was provided by the insightful screen-writer Robert Bolt, who also wrote the screenplay for ""A Man For All Seasons"".The story is told very well, and the acting is convincing. But it did not, I feel, fulfill its potential. There are lots of close-ups and tense scenes within confined spaces, which indicates, to me, that the director was attempting to psychologically analyze the events on board the Bounty, but it seems to fail, nevertheless, to plumb the emotional depths of the characters. One feels, for example, that Anthony Hopkins was there to render the nuanced performance he did for ""The Remains of the Day"" a number of years later, but he was just not utilized by this director.So it is good, but knowing, as most of us probably do, how talented the actors are, it is not as good as it could, and therefore should, have been."
4,"Whiskey, Stale Smoke, and Regret","The best way to talk about this album is the images it conjures up. It makes me want sit in the dark, drinking whiskey straight from the bottle, smoking a million cigarettes and thinking about how my baby is dead and gone. It's cheap motels and clandestine affairs, sin and salvation, disinterest and passion, joy and regret. Needless to say, it's good."
2,Disappointing,"This CD is very disappointing. I liked Isobel's first solo albumn. It was fun. But she is not exactly known for her vocals, so I thought the addition of The Screaming Trees Mark Lanegan would make for a kicking mix. But he just sort of follows her lead and sings along with no energy. She is doing her usual whispering. The songs aren't very interesting. It gets old real fast. This albumn seems very self-indulgent and was a waste of my time."
1,I agree,"This CD is a horrible waste of time. The Cd sounds like it is playing over and over again the same song. A ""single"" release would have been sufficient. Lanegan needs to take his rough voice and join a hard rock band, not QOTSA, but something a bit more solid."
2,Not the best for business cards,"I used this strictly for business cards. For them to fit I have to cut the top and bottom off of the card so that it fits and then staple it in. Sometimes when I staple a card in, the actual sheet breaks away from the rolodex. This is not the most sturdy rolodex.Saying this, it is helpful and lets me find my contacts very quickly...after taking the time to cut the cards."
2,Not well made,"Doesn't compare to the MADE IN AMERICA Rolodex I used 20 years ago. Sloppy construction, difficult to rotate, cards fall out, stick together, and tear easily. MADE IN CHINA SUCKS!"
2,Disapointed,"The rotary file came without plastic sleeves to slip business cards into. To make matters worse, I couldn't find plastic sleeves to fit the cards that came with the file. Sleeves for the size cards that come with the file are not being made any more. SOME BARGAIN"
4,White cards are a bit thin,"The cards themselves are a bit thinner than my original Rolodex. I'm concerned that the punches will wear out quickly with use.Although most of my current contacts are stored electronically, I like using the Rolodex for other things such as library card numbers and infrequently needed phone numbers. A Rolodex is great for storing all types of information that typically starts out on little bits of paper.For passwords, I now use ""1password"" and have shredded my old Rolodex cards where I previously kept some passwords."
2,This was for Dad.,He can't separate the pages so its not a good thing for an older person. Wish I could make it work for him.
2,Not what it should be,"I have used Sigma's 50/1.4 on both Canon and Nikon mounts the old Minolta 1.7 and Canon and Nikon's own version. Sony is the worst of them. Sony is trying to get into the pro market but will need to do a much better job. This lens is way to soft in the corners, the focusing ring is not very comfortable to work with and and it is slow to AF on the A350 and 7xi bodies I tried it on. I know Sony can make some decent lenses but this is far from it. Sony users would be much better off with the Sigma 50/1.4 it is a excellent lens that far surpasses this or even try picking up the old Minolta one if you can find it. Competing against the 1.8 Nikon and Canons it would be a fair comparison, but 1.4 is leaning towards the pro side and this lens fails against it's rivals"
3,An excellent primer,"As a primer, perhaps even a textbook, this volume is excellent. The book contains brief essays that cover almost every topic of violence and aggression that I can think of: for a quick overview. There is little in depth material, and absolutely no documentation. They are great discussion starters or first steps for project oriented material, but they really don't tell you where to go from there. Still, I will keep it on my shelf for reference. I'm sure it will come in handy for a long time."
2,Not the right size,I purchased this item in order to be able to place business cards inside so they were easily accessible. The card sizes do not accommodate business cards therefore creating more work to either type out the info or write it out by hand. I would not purchase this product again.
2,Big & Bulky,"The item serves it's purpose - it sits on my desk, right at my fingertips, and I want all of my contacts available if I have to change jobs again. Not in an electronic database on the company's computer or cell phone. That being said, this thing is Very Bulky - a lot bigger than it appears in the picture. I keep it open so as to minimize the appearance of the size. It looks like a huge globe when closed."
2,Not for Me,"I need to return this item. I opened it but have not been happy with the awkward turning of the knobs. It just seems uncomfortable and too large for my desk. Love the looks,love the fact that I can cover it for a neater look but just do not like having to turn the dial. Not easy finding the cards. Seems easier to use my fingers."
1,My First Negative Review,"I am a constant Amazon customer, and this is my first negative review. This Covered Rolodex arrived with many of the Index Guides missing. While this may be nothing more than a few dollars of annoyance in an urban environment, in a rural location, it's not so easy to correct."
3,Bigger isn't better,"When I ordered item, didn't read specs on actual size, and it's alot larger/bulkier than I needed. Would be o.k. if you had alot of contacts."
1,2 out of 3 failed on me,"Got three of these exact toaster ovens as gifts for the holiday, and that was funny but actually came in handy since one of the three was dead on arrival so we used the second and returned the third. Now a month later and 5 to 6 uses and this one is dead too! (no lights, no heat, nothing) The unit just doesn't come on, and is dead. I wouldn't normally report the faulty unit, but 2 out of 3 failed on me so that is pretty bad. When it worked it was great."
1,Disappointed,"Terrible toaster oven!! No catch on the rack so half the time it falls out of the oven and the food goes flying. Takes a while to heat up and, due to rack layout, everything I bake in it burns on the top. Thought I would like it because of the brand and the sturdy feel but - Hate it!! Used it for two months and then bought a Black and Decker."
2,Design Engineering Breakdown!,"A KitchenAid tradition as always been to use quality materials and parts and this toaster oven is no exception, however it appears as though they selected the wrong parts to go with the materials in this instance. The entire unit becomes very hot to the touch just making light toast and then requires a long period of time to cool down. The extremely long period of time required for the heating elements to heat up causes the bread to completely dry out and you wind up with a Melba toast effect. I did not test the unit any further than toast as the unit became so hot just making light toast I could not imagine how hot it could have gotten trying to bake or broil something. I am sure that this unit will be working 40 years from now like so many of the KitchenAid products do, but who needs it."
3,Kitchen Aid Oven,"Nice oven, probably the best one I've owned. I've had it for about 5 months now. Accurate and reliable so far ... But like every toaster oven I've owned, it has a lot to be desired in making toast. Never toasts the bottom and the top evenly. Great for making a toasted open face sandwich or warming up pizza.Would I buy it again? I'm not really sure, I'm done buying cheap appliances for my kitchen, but I expected a bit more for this price."
2,"Worked fine for a few months, now nothing. no lights no power.","I am on the internet searching for a way to repair this oven, and the first link that came up was amazon, so I thought I would put my 2 cents in. We got it for a disabled friend of ours and it worked fine for awhile, but one day it just stopped. No lights, no heat, nothing. Seems to be fairly common with this oven.We selected this oven because the build quality felt solid and the design and styling was good. I would be wary of this model. The funny thing is there is really nothing to break in a toaster. I mean the moving parts (dials, trays, etc) all work fine still. The rest is solid state and should last 20 years. So much for that idea."
1,The worst I've ever owned,"Ever feel like you've been totally ripped off? I did after I bought this piece of junk. Long story truncated, I waited too long to return it. So I've tried to make it work,What went wrong? 1. The oven rack warped. 2. It smells when heated over 350 degrees. 3. The temp settings are wildly inaccurate. 4. (My fault on this) 30 minute timer is too short. Get a ""stay on"" feature if you plan on doing serious baking or roasting. 5. Broil will simply not work,In short, given the general quality of Kitchen Aid products this oven is either a lemon, which I doubt given other reviews, or simply an attempt to cash in on a brand name by using cheap components."
1,Unusual for Kitchen Aid to put out a lousy product,"I have always bought Kitchen Aid products and liked them but I would recommend staying away from the Kitchen Aid toaster oven model KCO1005. Besides minor inconveniences like not heating up very quickly, it didn't last long - no light, no heat. After troubleshooting it, I found a faulty overtemp thermostat which is not available from Kitchen Aid or anyone else on the internet. Don't try pulling it out of the circuit because the oven will trip circuit breakers since there is no control over the heating elements."
1,No wonder KA retired these toaster ovens,"I also owned this toaster oven and I was very disappointed. The first one broke after 6 months (no light, no power) and Kitchen Aid replaced it with another one which I only used for less than 2 months before it died again (no light, no power again!!!). I called Kitchen Aid customer service and they told me that since they no longer manufacture(No Wonder)these toaster ovens, the best they can do is give me a $10 coupon off any of their corded appliances. What a joke! Kitchen Aid further informed me that they might come out with another toaster oven at the end of the year...well, good luck with that one, I thought...no more Kitchen Aid toaster ovens for me!"
1,Short Life,"Bought this to be able to toast 6 slices of bread at a time,Most bread is too large to fit six slices in. I still enjoyed the oven for toasting up a sandwich and such, however, I only got to use the oven for about a year. Like so many other complaints, mine too is dead. No power lights or anything. I am a handy with doing my own repairs and have not been able to locate ANY parts for this. None of the part suppliers stock any parts for these.$130.00 for a year's use is pathetic. Prior to it dying,the timer knob broke off in my hand.It looks great, but looks aint everything! This one is going in the trash and I'm looking for another brand.Do yourself a favor and google this model number for reviews, I wish I would have,I would have saved $130!"
1,Expensive disappointment,"The top heating implement stopped working 15 months after purchase, just in time for the 1 year warranty to expire. Customer Service at Kitchenaid only handles replacement of the whole unit, not parts, so repairing the thing isnt possible. This was an overpriced, no-frills unit capitalizing on its trusted brand name. Big disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"Tried this Kitchenaid model after trying an Oster Convection that ended up being a little big, and the reviews I'd read scared me off. I don't want to worry about an exploding toaster oven! Wish I'd have believed some of the negative reviews of this Kitchenaid, as I think I'm going to have to return it. After burning a few things, I put my oven thermometer in there and found that it heats more than 100 degrees above the set temp. Makes me wonder what would happen if I broiled something. I don't think I'd be happy having to always adjust cooking temps that much, nor having to remind everyone else using the oven to do the same. So, back to the drawing board. I've had a lot of different cheap models that I just bought on a whim when needed, and they all did well enough for me until they finally gave up. I think doing the research now is going to drive me batty! Happy Hunting."
4,Great fun,"I liked playing these games w/ my kids (ages 6 and 7) -- the third one was the best, because (in theory) all three could play -- we didn't have an additional remote or adapter, but I think the boys would have liked it even more then.We started playing video games together w/ Lego Star Wars, Lego Indiana Jones, some anime ones, etc... and since my kids know the HP stories pretty well (what?!? They're mature enough! We talked about it -- and still do!)... they liked being a part of it.A fun one for parents to play with kids, if the parents are like me, from the video game generation. Long live ATARI! ~kidding.. sort of."
5,GREAT GAME!!,I bought this game for my 13 year old. He loves it. It is both fun and challenging for him. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
2,Would not display on TV resolution.,It was very simple to use and hookup to a TV but all the TVs that I connected it to gave me an error. It said it didn't support a high resolution. I tried to find more information or how to change settings but I was never successful. I also do not have contact info for the manufacturer. Still pictureless and frustrated.
3,"There a little cheap looking, but they are rock solid",I'm doing a hid retrofit so these will work perfectly and sense there made from what looks and feels like fiber glass makes the retro fit go so much easier and look nice. There lenses are crystal clear and easy to split from the housing compared to other. But don't get me wrong these lenses were sealed really well.
5,Fit Perfectly,Was Concerned about the fit and quality for the price. Product is good quality and fits great! Replacement was a snap.
3,gran prix headlight,"lamp height adjusters were different sizes, but still a good deal for the price! much better than buffing out old lights!"
4,lights for car,The lights were brand new but they still did not shine very bright. But were received as indicated. Did not have any issues with order.
5,Great value,I got this light for WAY cheaper than any other store or from the dealer...great value for brand new lights. They were easy enough to install and even came with a new bulb. Definitely something I might consider buying for all my cars.
2,Outdated,"I got this guide as a gift. Unfortunately, by the time I got it many of the places had moved or were out of business. I know it's not the guide's fault, and more a trend in this transient city, but it became outdated too quickly."
5,Helps get your brain in gear!,"Ever have one of those days when you just can't get it together? I did and decided to sit down and read Brain Brilliant. It was the help I needed to see what was really going on in my head. From eating a proper breakfast to remembering someone's name, Brain Brilliant helps to overcome ""brain drain"" and get things done. Brain Brilliant answers some of the questions that seem to lag in the back of your brain, and along with simple exercises, helps you to answer them."
5,onward to sky island!!!,"once again luffy and the gang have driven themselves into impossible odds, as this time they plan to set sail to the mystical sky island. but before even getting the chance to attempt it, they must conceive a plan before pointlessly throwing their lives away. This is officially where the anime takes a completely new twist, and thats not a bad thing. get ready for one thriling ride as the straw hats make their way onward."
1,Don't bother.,"I'm going to keep this short. I've read many books on Craps. This is probably the worst or second worst I've ever read out of over double digit books on the subject. It's unreal. It's pretty much ""crap"". I usually look for books that are going to say something different than other books so I bought this one. This one is different for sure, but unfortunately I feel that it didn't add anything to my knowledge of the game or possible gameplay."
5,An Amazing Adventure for Everyone!!,"What could be more enticing than playing against just time and yourself? It's like a reality show where you are the main character and all you have to do is follow the rules. But, in this show, you can play in your pajamas, not embarrass your family, and still reach your goals. This is a neat book, it's easy to understand and simple to play. With almost 3 million books on Amazon, there is no other book that comes close to pure adventure. Just think of what you can do with $50,000! Stop playing the lottery. Stop going to the casinos. If you really want to make money and have a blast doing it, put in some research and have your family, your school, your work or your community get involved. Don't be surprised when your teenager tells you, ""Hey mom, I'm taking the family to Disney World."""
1,What Was Terje Thinking?,"I'm not sure what exactly this album is supposed to be, but it's in no way one of Terje's best. This is some of biggest bunch of nothing I've ever heard. Terje Rypdal may be a great composer, but he's in no way a good classical composer. This album is evident of that. If you're a fan or potential fan of Terje's, then check out these albums:""Descendre"" - 1980, ECM""Blue"" - 1987, ECM""Waves"" - 1978, ECM""To Be Continued"" - 1981, ECM""Eos"" - 1985, ECM""After the Rain"" - 1976, ECMAll these albums are good places to start exploring the sonic world of Terje Rypdal."
3,NOT BAD,"They look and work pretty good, but they don't fill the entire space of the originals. There are sizable gaps on each side."
5,Great Value,"Fit the car well (2001 Grand Prix SE). Took just a couple minutes to figure out how to move the signal & corner light wiring from the original (there are NO instructions), but the rest of install was a breeze. Some have pointed out the profile doesn't seem quite right -- headlight seems to protrude further toward the inside than the originals -- I noticed that, but didn't take the time to find a reason because it's not really noticeable.These aren't exactly OEM replacements, but, they fit, they work, and you cannot beat the pricetag. For an older car, these are great.Best thing: My wife can see again!"
2,Questionable Fit and Quality,"You get what you pay for. The cost of these headlights was pretty good, but the overall fit is poor and both have fogged up under humid conditions. The driver's side headlight takes on water when it rains and when I wash the car. I also have serious questions about how long the lens plastic is going to hold up before it begins to craze and fog up. I would avoid these particular lights."
1,Extremely POOR Quality laminates,"I would be very wary of the positive reviews on this product. I find it hard to believe that such a piece of garbage could be thought of so highly. First off, you must hold the top down to get the item being laminated through the machine. This would be a minor inconvenience if this was the only problem. The really bad news is that the laminate bubbles horribly, and it is hazy rather than clear. How anyone would use this for photos is beyond me. Next, the magnetic backing doesn't stick at all to whatever your laminating. It just falls right off. There is absolutely nothing worthwhile about this piece of junk. I bought this based on the reviews of the others here. Shame on them for misleading people in this way. If you want to use this as an arts and crafts type of toy for pre-kindergarteners, maybe. For serious use, never. Spend the extra money and get a quality heat laminating machine."
2,Not Happy,You cant find the double sided lamination cartridge for it anymore its been discontinued. That really upset me because I bought this machine just to laminate stuff!
4,A fine taste of what's to come from this woman.,"All I can say is that this CD is awesome. I adore the lyrical content on this song and it's nothing but a breath of fresh air for female R&B. Just in time when a lot of female-driven songs were about nothing but ""he done me wrong"" and ""I kicked him to the curb"". This tune shows that women like her has nothin' but respect for the male species and knows that good men are in existence. Aside from the lyrical content, the music is on point and will either make you dance or nod your head. Give it a listen."
4,The Real American Idol,"I have been anxiously awaiting Latoya London's debut album and I have not been disappointed. On American Idol, she demonstrated a range of styles and vocal abilities that was by far the best of the bunch. However, American Idol is a popularity contest so...If you are looking for good R&B; music then you've found it! Latoya does not disappoint. ""How I love the Rain"" is my favorite.I love the album!"
4,Short and not-so-sweet,"Roald Dahl once said the secret to writing a good kid's book is to conspire with the children against adults, and this book is a perfect example of that.This is for the child (and adult) who feels the bears in the Goldilocks were victims of a breaking-and-entering little vandal, who really would like to see a more self-empowered red riding hood, and who thinks that third little pig was a smug git who'd probably taste good on rye with a bit of mustard.The only flaw with the book is its brevity. You can read the whole book aloud in about a half-hour. One is really left wanting more. (Thurber wrote some good fables in a similar vein, but they're less for children and more dated.)"
5,What a Twist!,"Dr Seuss is nothing in comparison to Roald Dahl in REVOLTING RHYMES. I actually had fun reading this book so did the kids I read it to. There are a few words I have to explain but it didn't take out the fun of the book. This book plays around with a few of the very known fairy tales known by kids and swing it around in an interesting parody.The list of the fairy tales with a twist that are being fetaured in this book:1. Cinderella2. Jack & the Beanstalk3. Snow Queen & the seven dwarfs4. Goldilocks & the three bears5. Little Red Riding Hood & the Wolf6. The Three Little PigsThe characters are hilarious and you will enjoy the different look of the old age fairy tales that you knew. So spread the word, buy a copy for yourself, read it to the children. Anyway, you won't regret this particular book."
5,Absolutely revoltingly brilliant,"""Jack's mother said we're stony broke. Go out and find some wealthy bloke."" Each line in this book makes me want to laugh. Boring classics are turned into brilliant tales, which children and adults alike will love. The hardest thing is finding a favourite. Cinderella has to be up there though - I nearly cry with laughter each time I read it.These fairytales have a wicked twist, and it's hard to say if they are funnier for parent or child, but I'm yet to find anyone who doesn't love them."
5,Highly recommended! (for readers about 13+ y.o.),"My dad used to read Roald Dahl books with me when I was a little tyke, and this particular little devil DEFINITELY lives up to its title, so if you're one of those parents who wraps their kid in cottonwool you'll want to pass it up. That being said, I am excessively fond of this book as it gives several traditional fairy tales a deliciously nasty twist that are unforgettable. Language use is about PG-13. If you and your kid are sensible/mature enough to have a sense of humor, you'll enjoy it immensely. My dad has since passed away but one of my many fond memories is that we both got a kick out of this clever little book."
1,THINK before you buy!,"For 20 years I have read Roald Dahl's books to my children and loved them all. After reading the positive reviews posted above I bought a copy of ""Revolting Rhymes"" for my 9 year old granddaughter. I could not be more disappointed! This book goes beyond gruesome, beyond revolting and in this reviewers eye is nothing more than an unscrupulous volume designed to debase the morals and integrity of our youth. (this from a liberal!) Fairy tales have been gruesome from their inception in the 19th century, Strewwelpeter by Heinrich Hoffmann being among my favorites. For those with a taste for the humorously frightful, check out Strewwelpeter. Responsible parents will pass on Revolting Rhymes."
1,warning...not for the young,"We bought this book because my daughter loves all of Roald Dahl's books. Fortunately, her teacher and I read it first because we came across the word ""slut."" I decided to shelve this book until my daughter is old enough to know what a ""slut"" is. I am extremely careful about what my kids are exposed to. I have placed blocks on the television channels that they are not allowed to watch, I read all their books first and censor their music. If you are like me, you'll want to skip this book."
3,smooth but needs to imrpove coverage,"Liked how smooth it was but even with 3 layers on top of the darkest part of my under eye circle, it didn't cover it. So I used the cover creme by dermablend & it worked well on top of the dark part but it was to cakey with the creme which I was hoping to avoid with just the concealer alone. Need more shades."
1,Product has not been received yet.,I can't rate this product as I still haven't received it yet. It has been at least 3 weeks and it still hasn't arrived.
2,Not up to the job,"This liquid in a tube is much too thin to cover up any dark areas. I am middle-aged and on a perpetual quest to find a concealer to cover up most of my under-eye dark circles. This Smooth Indulgence concealer simply can't do the job for me--it lightens them I suppose to a slight extent more than using nothing at all, but that's about it.Too bad, because the liquid itself has a pleasant texture and pretty much stays put. The Dermablend Quick Fix stick (lipstick-style) does a much better job of coverage."
1,Save your money,I purchased this tiny bottle in hopes of covering up an ugly spot on my skin. Well after several layers of this product I still see the spot. I bought regular foundation and it covered better than this product. I only gave it one star because it wouldn't allow me to go lower. This is alot of money for something that doesn't work.
3,Not as good as I'd hoped...,"I'm disappointed in this product because it's quite watery. I bought this because I have facial and body acne, and hoped it would do a better job than the other Dermablend (""light"" body cover cream) I've tried, which doesn't match my ivory skin well unless I have a real tan, and then it's still a little too pink. This one is now too light! Won't buy again."
2,very light cover,the product is not the same of picture. I received the new version of the product and is not the same. the cover is very light and do not last hours like original
3,Rifts Sourcebook 2: The Mechanoids,"Crazied Cyborgs on an insane mission to wipe out all humaniod life from the Megaverse. Live the action in battling an almost unstoppable foe. Share in the terror, the sorrow, and the fear. To drive you on your mission to save the Megaverse, and give back hope to those you protect."
5,Genre fiction at its best,"After 15 years of buying books on Amazon.com, I'm writing my first review following a sleepless night of reading The Hawks of Kamalon. The story is thoughtful and the characters well developed. But what makes the book so magnetic is how well this is accomplished through its string of expertly crafted action sequences. It's impossible to put this book down. And the sci-fi premise actually just provides launchpad for a character-driven narrative about the heroic potential of individuals, regardless of their backgrounds (or planetary origin). A simply enjoyable read that really needs a sequel."
5,Great mag,"I love this magazine! subscription is slow to arrive but worth the wait. ESP. If you live in VA, you need this book!"
4,great,"How do you review an item like this? Well, it did what it was supposed to do, and has not leaked since. For that it should get 5 stars.But I will only give it 4 stars, as the delivery time was longer than I was expecting. Had to hold my finger over the leak longer than I had hoped waiting for the item to arrive."
5,Fabulously Inspirational,This book contains great works of furniture design and I think that it is priced reasonably too. I find it to be very inspirational and just great to own!
1,Petroleum and not synthetic...,"I recently purchased Syntec and won't buy Castrol products again for the bit of deception they pull here.Despite what the market blurb on the bottle might say, this is not a true Type IV-V synthetic which contain no petroleum. This is actually a Type III petroleum product. They should advertise it for what it is."
3,"Pleasant, hopeful fluff!","A delightful read for the budding social entrepreneur. Chock full of practical ways in which the hopelessly hopeful idealist can profit by doing good. Or, as the saying goes, one might hope to use the lessons from this book to, ""do well by doing good."""
5,I loved this book from the very first page,"Buy it now! You'll be a happier person after you read this book, whether you're in business or not. It provides great and much-needed hope and inspiration for entrepreneurs and employees of all stripes and ages, and is both a fun and easy read, with the writers' wit and heart shining throughout. (And I'm a tough-to-please newspaper editor and author!)"
3,"Nice, simple flashlight, but bulb not replaceable (?)","We use these in our labs, but now that the bulb went out on one of them, it appears they are ""throw-away"" technology. Not good for the overall value."
4,A great assistant for your Roomba,"A must have for Roomba (4th generation & earlier) owners with 2 or more batteries. Helps to keep the second battery charged while Roomba is working. In addition, its also useful for conditioning old/new batteries, works better than the 72hr charge on Roomba itself."
5,roomba battery rapid charger,this item preforms as advertised - it charges roomba batteries fast and the charge lasts a long tme
4,Only option for Roomba internal charge failure.,If you have a Roomba Vacuum and the internal charge circuits have failed this will keep your Roomba running. It is not nearly as much fun as having it go home to its dock and play the mission completed tune but it will charge the battery so that your beloved pet vacuum will still work for you. Possibly a practiced hacker could work out how to install the electronics from this unit into a failed Roomba. Not Me. Meanwhile Owsley (The Roomba) once again trundles about the house cleaning the floors and keeping the cats entertained and I do not have to pick up the broom!
4,"Not exactly a Disney ending, but not bad nonetheless","Coldwater is a fascinating book about 3 women Charlotte, Emily and Anne who have lived there last 8 years on the island of coldwater, which just so happens to be a prison. No anne charalotte and emily are not convicts. They are the daughters of Captain Wolf, who owns the prison even as they go about there normal lives the prison is beginnign to affect them too. When a convict attempts to murder there father they're suddenlly faced with the notion of what would happen if he were to die? Where would they stay? Charlotte has the bright idea of becoming authors to make there money so they set out to do this, but then there life begins to take some unexpected turns.Written in four different peoples views, this facsinating novel toys with the idea that your sourroundings now can affect you for the rest of your life. This is a truly magnificent story, but rememer does not end with a Disney ending. A wonderful book for young adults and adults"
4,Catchy and Energetic,"I was privileged enough to get to meet Paul Wright at a concert recently for a retreat I helped to lead. He is a pleasant person, and he even trusted me watch his booth for him while he performed. He is a great performer and knew how to work the crowd. His songs have a hint of Jack Johnson, but with more of a funk feel."
3,just okay...,"my only complaint (kind of a big one tho) is that the sound being produced in extremely rounded. the EQ doesnt allow for boosting of the mids, only cutting. other than that, it does what it's supposed to do."
3,"Very comfortable shoe, but a piece of rubber sole fell off after 2 months","I have absolutely loved this shoe. It is extremely comfortable and looks great. I just now encountered a problem with it though. Yesterday, after only having the shoes for a couple of months, a piece of rubber sole came off the bottom. I will have to find the right glue to reattach it. That is a shame because I really like the shoe."
5,Love it,Very easy to use and quickly turns business cards into useful rolodex cards. After spending time in the past gluing the cards to rolodex pages this really was a great time saving tool.
3,My Review For The Rough face Girl,"Rating this book from a scale of one to five I would have to give it a 3 not because I didn't like the book,which I did, but because it was just another version of Cinderella but with a twist. The twist in fact was what I liked most; the girl had to have seen the invisible man to get married to him.Overall other than giving this book a 3 I give it two thumbs up because I enjoyed reading this book."
1,NoPE,"Did nothing Don't waste your money. Buy xzen 1200 it's the best out there and cheap on eBay, or you can get it at some of your local stores"
5,"""Simply Great!!""","I've just bought the Nordan CD, and I must say it's one of the best records I've ever listened to. It's a perfect blend between modern and traditional music, and there's a lot of feeking in it. My favourites are ""Sven i Rosengard"" because Lena Willemark's singing really conveys the pain and anguish the song's main character experiences, and ""Gullharpan"". This CD really is extraordinary because it it no everyday record; really something special. The only thing which I rather disliked was that they didn't print the lyrics. My Swedish is not too good, and I had trouble understanding the contents of the songs. Can anybody help me?"
1,This is nothing but a prospectus for O'Shaughnessy's funds,"This book does nothing but tell you the formulas O'Shaugnessy uses to run his funds. The book did not teach me how to retire rich, merely some investment techniques. If you want to know how to retire rich, you are better off reading ""The millionare next door""."
2,"Started good, but then...","I don't know how to take this book. On the positive side, it offers seemingly reasonable investment strategies for inexperienced investors. At worst, the strategies are thought provoking. At best, they may be providing strategies that will make alot of people retire rich. On the negative side, I am skeptical of the author's intentions of writing this book. He sells mutual funds that implement the strategies (which is not necessarily a bad thing), but the funds have yearly fees of 1.5% each! That is very high for a passive fund. Why so high? All of a sudden, I want to stop reading. Finally, the book didn't teach me 250+ pages of info. It may be good for the new investor, but for one like me that has read a few books (but not done alot yet), it didn't offer alot of new insight. (I just can't get that 1.5% out of my head...)"
2,Disappointing. Read Carlson instead.,"I expected more. His methods are expensive because of fees and more work compared to other strategies. Charles Carlson's ""Eight Steps to Seven Figures"" is better and more inspirational.If you must read this book, get it from the library, skim it, and invest the money you've saved in a no-load index fund.Josh Sowinfireandknowledge.org"
5,Excellent for our use.,We have used this book for years to record our jobs....works great.Price was better than at our normal outlet.
2,Excellent Conclusion to the Trilogy!,"However, since this is the first book in the series, it can be fairly said that there are some problems here.The biggest one is that Gentle never quite explains how things got to be the way that they are in this world that is allegedly ""a past that could have been"". For contrast, consider the gradual unveilling of the history of the world in ""Ash: The Secret History"". There is nothing of the sort going on in this book.Furthermore, if I hadn't already read some of Frances Yates' studies of the influence of magical philosophy on history and science, I'd have been completely lost. As it stands, I was only almost completely lost. I really don't think one should have to have an extensive understanding of the Hermetica in order to understand what is going on in a novel."
1,Horrible,"The only fantasy genre book I never finished. It is a pet peeve of mine not to finish books even when they are bad. However, I made an exception for this one. I have no idea what the plot of this story is and what the heck was going on, but whatever it was it added up to bad reading. Seems like a good idea for a book; however, I'm not exactly sure what the author was trying to convey with this story or even what that idea may be. Apologies for lack of detail, but I just don't know how to describe this book except that it was bad."
1,Bad read...,"I remember trying to read this book in high school for a book report. I knew I liked fantasy games and that type of thing, but I hadn't ever tried to read a fantasy book before. This was my first and it almost ruined me for good on fantasy. ""Rats and Gargoyles"" was one of the few books I never finished. It is a confusing read and halfway through the book I still didn't understand it. Meanwhile, 2 days before the book report was due my friend lent me ""Darkwalker on Moonshae"" in the Forgotten Realms series by Douglas Niles to read in place of it. I finished that book in 2 days and enjoyed it immensely.Now, 6 years later I'm still reading fantasy. I say skip this book, and check out Forgotten Realms or books by R.A. Salvatore, George R.R. Martin, and the Lord of the Rings books. You'll be much more interested in fantasy and continue discovering new writers."
2,"A difficult, uninvolving book","This book is, first and foremost, a difficult read. That's not necessarily a bad. It's sometimes nice to sit back with a book where language and imagery are just as important as plot. Michael Williams' _Arcady_ and most of Patricia McKillip's works spring to mind as similarly ""difficult"" reads (that I have enjoyed), for comparison.However, where those other works reward the reader's efforts with intriguing characters or classic story, Rats&Gargoyles failed to catch my interest at just about every turn. Too many characters, too much peripheral action, too little time spent on important elements left me feeling ""at sea"" throughout the book, wallowing through page after page of pretty language without any stable character or plot thread for me to latch onto as the ""important"" stuff. In the end, I finished the book more because I had paid for it and felt obligated to finish rather than out of any real enjoyment gained."
3,Kind of Boring,"This was my first time watching a series from the ""Seasoned Traveler"", so I have nothing to compare it to other than Rick Steve's and Samantha Brown European series. Well, this doesn't match up to Rick's or Samantha's series. I felt this video on Slovenia was pretty boring and showed little excitement. I'm planning to visit this country next year, and I hope to enjoy it more than I enjoyed this video."
2,This is not Preacher,"It is worse. It tries to be Preacher, it tries to be Hellblazer... it is naught. Constantine is one of the coolest and most awful characters ever created. When the torch passed to Delano from Moore, there was no loss. Delano's run was just great very intelligent, and the violence vas never to show off or to be a bad boy, it was used when necessary, as a part of the story. But here we have vomit, urination, gore etc. Things a b movie or gore movie fan might find exciting, but which an intelligent reader finds boring. Yes, not a scandal or rebeliuos, just plain boring. It is a sad fact that Ennis, who wrote the amazing ""Dangerous Habits"" story, sunk so childishly low."
4,"This is the complete theatrical cut, it's NOT a cut version, people!","The two comments about this being a cut version are misleading. This is the complete theatrical version as released at 238 minutes. There WERE various cut versions that the producers released without the director's approval, but this is not one of them. It's the version Visconti sanctioned to be released at the time. To speak of the only version worthy of release as being a 6 hour version is certainly a bit extreme. Would you refer to the approved theatrical release of Bergman's Fanny and Alexander as cut?"
2,ludwig,"Saw a special screening of the complete 6-hour version at the SF Film Festival about 8, or so, years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Am truly disappointed that the complete version has not been offered yet in Region 1 format. Criterion did such a great job on Visconti's THE LEOPARD that they will, hopefully, retrieve this fumble in short order.Ludwig"
4,Very beautiful,Enjoyed the film! Complicated story. We are currently living in Germany and for this reason I am fascinated with the whole Ludwig story. Great job.
1,ludwig,"After having ordered much from Amazon in the past few months, and with a great deal of satisfaction for the quality of product and speed of delivery,I must express great disappointment with the movie Ludwig. After havng seen the original years ago and being led to beleive that this new realese was a restored version, I would not recommend the movie and advise Amazon to mention that it is a seriously cut version of the original Visconti masterpiece which I have awaited with great anticipation. Why short change yourselves and us with such an inferior, chopped-up productiion of a truly great work of cinema art????????????????????????"
2,VISCONTI AT HIS WORST,"Unintended illustration of why European royalty had to disappear. Stomach-turning posturing by Berger, superfluous celebration of full frontal nudity, pointless smiles by Schneider, unnecessary elaboration of fatuous court politics, embarrassing evidence that Wagner was a fraud."
2,Totally disappointing,"I used to be crazy about Visconti's turgid movie concoctions, which I must report sadly do not stand the test of time. Helmut Berger in overdrive as the mad king, and Helmut Griem as his loyal pretty face. Romy Schneider and Silvana Mangano as moving decorative objects (count the number of times Romy steps out of coaches). Tedious tirades from irrelevant characters. But worse, a very coyapproach to the whole subject of the king's attraction to males, which in Viscontis' view serves as compensation for his two great unrequited loves: his cousin the Empress and Wagner. Part turkey, part architectural documentary. By now, a historical curiosity."
1,English version of Ludwig,"I saw LUDWIG with English Dialog in the 1973 MGM domestic release.The NYC premiere was reported to be in English. Has anyone noticed that the lip movement is in English....Has a lip-reading expert seen this film, and is still convinced the original ""shooting language"" was Italian ?Where is the English track for this release ?"
3,From Back Cover,"Larger-than-life magnate Jason Fortune didn't have time for matters of the heart - until he was forced to work with Adele O'Neil. And though Jason couldn't deny that the fiercely independent redhead had gotten under his skin, he thought he could satisfy his curiosity and walk away. Until they made love... and Jason realized that he wanted more from this woman who matched him in fire and strength!1st in the Fortune's Children - The Grooms series"
4,A heart stopper! Do you know where your children are?,"Becker is an intriguing character who wrestles with his own past while trying ensure that a young boy still has a future. It will hold you captive while making you squirm in your seat. Don't read this is you are the slightest bit disturbed by crimes against children. David Wiltse writes with such clarity that the reader wants to jump into the book and rescue the victims. The ending can't come soon enough, but the story is so well told you'll want it to go on"
3,Average Read - Just Okay,"An okay book, readable, but I was surprised it was a Main Selection of the Literary Guild. The problem I'm having might not be the book per se, but I really didn't like Karen Crist -- the main character. She is really bitchy. In other words, she isn't anybody I would care for as a character. In fact, one of the villians who is mentally retarded is much more likeable than KarenMy favorite character in the novel is the main villian who is a woman named Dee -- she is great because she is so evil and terrible. Not a person to want to run into in real life, but great to read about.A former FBI agent named Becker is dragged into the case by Karen to find the person responsible for kidnapping and then murdering young boys. Both Karen and Becker do a horrible job of figuring out who the killer is. I guess I wasn't particularly drawn to either of them, which makes it harder to get into the novel."
2,The Heros are Sicker than the Villians,"This is the second Becker book I've read and it will be the last. The plot isn't so bad, and the writing is about par for the genre. If you like your hero? (Becker) whining and full of angst, then this series is for you. I might be able to tolerate Becker's problem for awhile, but to cough up any empathy for the lead female character, Karen Crist, is impossible. All I could think of by the end was -- why isn't Child Welfare coming to remove this child from this damaged, bitter, and abusive mother. By staying with her, poor Jack may not end up dead, but he stands a good chance of ending up being the same kind of ""monster"" (like Dee) the FBI will be looking for in a few years. Im glad I got it at the used book store and didn't pay top price for it."
4,The Music World is missing OUT!,"Everyone should listen to this young lady. When it happens for her, watch out LADIES(Toni and ect.) Louisiana will have another PROUD artist among the group.. This young lady has so many vocal styles, a treat every time I hear her..."
5,Great,"I just got my phone and I just wanted to add a little ""flare"" to it to make it even more spectacular. I love the color and its squishy which I like too."
3,"OK, but not special","These taste fine and are as represented, but they don't have a particularly strong wasabi flavor. The packaging is good--the bags are sturdy and reseal nicely, so they are good for putting in a lunch bag or backpack."
5,The perfect food,"I absolutely love these nuts! Not only are they rich in fiber, and protein,they are also packed with flavor. They are nice and crunchy, and only have a tad bit of sea salt.t"
5,jmd,"Fantastic alternative snack. Same high protein low carb and calories as a can of tuna without the mercury. Taste better than nuts, and have less fat and more dietary fiber. The wasabi is a nice touch. The plain salted ones are great too."
1,terrible,please don't buy this terrible cd. it doesn't reflect the actual turkish music at all. this is just awful.
1,This Song Sucks!,"Once again Barbra has gone to the well of romantic cliche's for another song so sappy it puts syrup to shame. Her voice sounds as good as ever, but emotionally she sounds like a romantic computer program. Competing with a younger singer like Celine Dion seemed to spark our girl on ""Tell Him,"" but most of ""Higher Ground"" sounded like leftovers that a singer of Barbra's caliber shouldn't get stuck with. Hopefully the rest of ""A Love Like Ours"" will be a little more original than this."
5,She just keeps getting better.,"This song is so beautiful it sends chills up and down my spine. You can just bet that this will be THE wedding song from this day forward. Barbra is the voice of the millenium. The words are poetry and the music is sublime. Who hasn't dreamed of a great love, you can tell that Barbra has definately found hers."
4,Very strong meaning,"I was given this CD to view for an up coming wedding and was asked if I could sing it. I hope that I can find a background tape so I can use it. Is that possible and if so where can I find it. Thank you very much so any information you can send to me. Also the music, printed."
2,"This is not Barbara Streisand as we know her, not good",I agree with comments from customer reviews - This is not Barbara at her best - 1st song is the best - all others sound alike - it is almost like she is not singing - all music sounds the same also - wish I never purchased this cd.
1,Repetitive,all of these songs sound the same. One of them would have been enough. I like her music but this one I should have passed on.
4,"The stars are for Barbra, the song so-so","Yes, her voice is still one of those wonders that stir/excite/compels us over and over again. All the new and younger divas may have vocal power, but Streisand has the true gift of making our heart beat faster - when singing appropriate material. ""Dream"" isn't good nor bad, a shade better than ""At the Same Time"" (which I'm sorry to say is one of the few Barbra songs I don't like). All Barbra fans should check out BSMG and see the up-to-date list of her songs on the upcoming album, among them a new version to ""The Music that makes Me Dance"". By just speculating, ""Dream"" may be of the more weaker songs of the album, that she ironically released as a single."
5,This book should be a MUST READ,"There are many imitations to the subject, but there's no replacing the classics. Even though the slang is straight from the 70's, Chaney Allen is one of the most honest and straightforward authors I've ever read. Her wisdom, courage and spirit was felt by this reader. Not only does she give wonderful advice on recovery, but is good for life, period. IMHO, college students should read this book, especially freshmen leaving home for the 1st time."
1,As dreadful as you can imagine,"Activists, unless they have talent, should stay far away from the recording studio. Paul was in love so he provided the backing for this non-musical diatribe. I'm not in favor of landmines, but the best thing about this cd single is that it's hard to find...all copies should be burned."
2,Die-hard McCartney fans only,"This only exists because McCartney was supporting his love interest at the time, Heather Mills.McCartney has long had a passing fancy with dance/techno music. His experimentations in this field rarely even end up on his experimental albums. The first Fireman album, ""Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest"", would be the best and most qualified example of this mostly due to the collaboration with Youth. This one-off song and remixes however lack that energy and creativeness.You know how sometimes you do something for your wife becuase she's your wife and you really don't want to? Like going to see a girl movie or clothes shopping? But you do it anyway because you love her? That's Paul and this CD."
1,Flame does not light up,"Received a malfunctioning product, does not light up. Have not received response to my inquiries regarding returns."
1,Bad Quality,"I ordered these candles thinking I was getting '4' because that's what it said, but I was wrong I only received 2 so from the begining I was dissapointed. Anyways the candles didn't smell that good and they never lasted that long, I put new batteries in them and maybe lasted about 1 week."
3,Gag gift for friend with same name!,This was just a fun gift for my friend that is a novice writer to have a published book with her name. The good news is the story was good too. I always check amazon for my crazy gift ideas.
3,just OK,"the fabric is really stiff. it is still working, the zippers & everything. i like that it has a reflective strip for visibility. maybe it will relax a little eventually.edited to add: a year later it is still working but one of the straps has started to rip, i think its time span is limited."
5,woodland camouflage backpack,this is a good bag. it has three smaller pockets and one great big compartment. i am putting some patches on it to make it look even better.
4,Nice color backpack,I bought 2 one red and one purple. They are very nice color. My sons love it. It's good price and good product. My 8th grader can carry his heavy book in it and it still look after 2 months. Good backpack with good price!
1,only lasted a month,"I bought this pack for my high-school-age son to use for school. After a month of regular use carrying his textbooks and supplies, fabric of the pack ripped along the zipper for the largest compartment, not mendable because the fabric was raveling. I noticed that other parts of the fabric were showing similar signs of failing. The great price was too good to be true."
4,Got Two,These bags are well-made and the colors are awesome. The zipper is really well made and this is not cheaply made.My son is rough with his backpacks and he swings his all over the place and I know he has thrown it a few times...The bag is as nice from when I brought it for him. Very Nice!!My daughter got the Purple bag and she loves it. I had to buy it as a replacement from a cheap backpack that fell apart in 4 days.I hope they last thoughout the year.
4,Pretty good for a scooter commuter,"Highly visible and cheap were the main selling points for me. This is a good pack for your student who walks to school or for bikers (of all ages and CC capacities)who want to be seen. I fall into the latter category as a scooter commuter and even though this pack does not look too cool it is a highly visible fireman yellow with reflective stripe and seems well made for the price. It doesn't seem designed for really heavy loads and does not feel waterproof, but for some school books and lunch it feels just about right. If it lasts more than a few months of daily use I will add another star in the comments section."
4,Almost as advertised,"I purchased this backpack because of the reflective strip on the back. I decided on the black backpack, but the so called ""reflective strip"" was not reflective at all. I tested the reflective strip by placing the backpack in one of my bedrooms, no lights on, almost completely blacked out, and shined a flashlight on it with the results showing no hint of reflective properties on this backpack at all. Otherwise the backpack seems to be of quality material and has a good amount of compartments available throughout. I am still disappointed at the strip not being reflective because I am going to use it for my rides on my motorcycle. I resorted to having a reflective belt being wrapped around the backpack for easier visibility for other motorists on the road.-In short, good quality material, plenty of spacious compartments, but no reflective strip. This was misleading during my decision to purchase it."
5,Great backpack,This is a great back pack. The zippers appear to work well and will be very durable. I recommend the product.
4,A great hunter's pack,"It's a great backpack to take hunting due to its color. You can safely wear it over your orange coat and be safely colored. The straps seem durable enough and there is enough room for hats, canteen, food, a lighter jacket, ammo, etc. and the other zippered pouches provide easier access to things you want to put there. It's not extremely rugged, but seems good enough. The bottom isn't reinforced like some specifically made outdoor packs I've seen but it's orange and not going to be going on 50 mile hikes, just day hunts."
2,Great Backpack - Very Functional - Update,"I received this pack as a gift and it was just what the doctor ordered. I like a backpack that it a bit more Spartan than the ""high-tech"" packs that the kids are carrying. This bag has a large single area that is roomy and allows me to see what is in my bag - it also has two smaller outer zipper pockets that hold the glasses & cell phone kind of stuff. Additionally I really like the way the main pocket opens - it is almost like a huge lunchbox when unzipped and it makes it very easy to pack and organize the bag. This is really a no frills back-pack; if you are looking for iphone holders, ear bud wiring, or speakers don't give this one another look. If you want a big roomy pack this is the ticket. Only criticism is that I would like to have had some pen holder pockets in the smaller enclosures, that is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars.UPDATE -After about 4 months of use the zippers are broken, too bad because I really like the backpack design."
4,Excellent Blend,"This book is an excellent blend of factual information, ease of understanding, and philosophical insight for the beginning student of architecture. There are other books which offer more information and/or insight, but few which are as good for the uninitiated."
4,Great sounds from colorado,"This Colorado band has got the chops, full speed ahead. These guys are fast,chock full of punk rock. Bands like Kid dynamite and dillinger four come to mind but to be honest these guys have their own sound and it sounds refreshing to hear these guys tear it up song after song. Best tracks:""say goodnight"", ""asking for a beating"",""jack knife powerbomb""."
4,Great story but the ending was too short.,"The book was well written the story line was great with all the scheming and misunderstandings and noncommunicating going on. I wish the ending could have been longer I would have like to see what happens to Emily, Dunsford and baby Harriet. I would have like to see what also happened during the birth of Bonny and Radcliff's baby whether it was a boy or girl. Other than the ending I enjoyed the book very much."
4,Gets the job done,"I use all kinds of electronic toys during work/play but still write notes on paper during meetings. Old habits die hard... If I write it down, I'll remember it.This is the best set up I've used. Compact and professional"
4,"High quality, high price","Great notebooks. I'm a heavy user of Android devices, and carry a Samsung Galaxy Nexus and Kindle Fire with me, but I still like to take notes on paper. Maybe someday I'll switch to Evernote, but for now, these notebooks are perfect for me."
4,Unfortunately last of a great series,"Virgin's only 8th Doctor New Adventure, and a sight better than most of the BBC's own 8th Doctor Books, this is a must read for fans of the NA's. The sad thing is it hints at how good a Virgin-produced 8th Doctor line could have been."
4,So long to the Doctor's NA's,"This is the final New Adventure by Virgin to feature the character of the Doctor. It is the only one to feature the 8th Doctor (Paul McGann from the TV movie). The only reason this one is not a 10 is that the Doctor while making a valiant effort to save the planet disappears from the novel. The Doctor leaves the reader and is not heard from for quite some time. The use of the Ice Warriors was terrific, they were very menacing in this work. All in all a wonderful adventure."
2,Derivative,"This book was an enjoyable enough read, but it was too much a rehash of 'The War of the Worlds' by HG Wells. Paying tribute is one thing, but not at the expense of originality."
4,"A compelling novel of ideas and emotion, well worth reading","Gateway to Heaven is a surprising, moving novel. In many ways, it reads as if one of the better Victorian novelists-- novelists of ideas, religion, romance, humor, and emotion-- were transported into the 1960s to write a book about the time. Gateway possesses some of the faults of a first novel (especially a Victorian first novel)-- occassionally it is a bit difficult to believe, and occasionally the conversations are a bit too abstract-- but its virtues in emotive power and intellectual weight far outweigh these vices. A rare piece of art."
2,Subpar novel,"Unlike the stunning book A SEVERE MERCY, Vanauken's novel GATEWAY TO HEAVEN is neither emotionally uplifting nor fascinating. It is melodrama, with most of the conversations being ""overdone"". Too much hype. This novel is not Vanauken's best work. Better to stick with A SEVERE MERCY."
1,Poor read,Unnecessary bad language. I know the area personally. Author misses opportunity to provide insightful view of the region. Save your time
3,Better as it went along,This book was hard to get interested in at the beginning. Too many plots and sometimes confusing. I was surprised I kept reading. Got better.
2,Still trying to read this one,"So far this has been a disappointment. I am having trouble getting into the story line. Perhaps as I struggle through it, I will find the action picking up."
1,not impressed,Too bad no one in mentioned in their reviews the profanity and sex.I barely made it to page 3 before encountering both. I can live without that and it adds NOTHING to the story! I could have saved some space on my Kindle. thank goodness this was a free download.
4,Good Book,Was a good read I was happy with it. The stories was easy to read and follow. It had a nice flow to it.
4,Down home mystery,"Good complicated plot. Good deep point of view in the leading character. Raunchy, slightly slapstick humor. Lots of local color in my hometown area. Enjoyed that."
5,Very nice read,"I have read this as well as several of the author's other books. They belong in the near-upper echelon of entertainment novels and I am surprised that they are on the ""free"" list. Highly recommended."
3,A Decent Read,Bone Dry was a decent good mystery that kept me reading until the end. It was entertaining but nothing spectacular. I've read much worse but also better. I gave it 3 stars because it was good enough to read and complete and interesting enough but nothing really special.
4,Great fun to listen to in the car.,I got this book on CD from the library. It was fun to listen to. I got hooked on it quickly and wanted to go for rides in the car just so I could listen to it. (Good thing gas prices have dropped.) I just put a reserve on the first book (on CD) - Buck Fever.
3,Big Game in Texas,"This fast moving mystery captured the language and culture of small town Texas. Many of the attitudes toward guns, outsiders and law enforcement were believable. Being from a small ranching community which is becoming more dependent on hunters, I am impressed. The characters were well drawn even though they were familiar stereotypes."
4,Fun and interesting!,"This book is one of the busier books I have read, lots of side plots, some humor, with enough intrigue to keep me turning those pages. I really did enjoy it."
5,LOLOL,"Laugh out loud funny, well written and a great plot. Fans of Evanovich will like this one. Can't wait to read more of them."
4,Better than I thought it would be,"I chose this rating because there were well developed characters and lots of ""brain storming"" that was totally off base. Some of the characters were idiots who thought they were smart as anyone else and law officers who were kept in the dark by the combination of different agencies. The cops worked together. The whole book was action after action. Kept me entertained."
2,you get what you pay for,"This was a free book that I got through Pixel of Ink. From the description, I thought it might be OK, but I got about two chapters into it and have lost interest."
4,wacky entertainment,"Being from Texas, I liked reading a story that takes place in familiar areas. I also liked the wacky characters and their odd behaviors. Kindly of reminds me of Carl Haissen's style."
1,Read just a few pages,The sexual content and language is not for me. I read a few pages of the book and closed it.
4,OK,"The book was free, and not bad for the price. I wanted to test out the Kindle app for my Iphone, and it worked just swell."
1,No good,Didn't finish it....Awful...............This is a no-good book as far as I am concerned.I wonder where you find some of this junk !
2,California Dreamin by Michelle Phillips,"This was Michelles' view of what she considered to be the TRUE story of the Mams and the Papas. I found her to be quite selfish, self-centered, and totally ""apathetic"" regarding her poor innocent PETS, who died because of NOT being important enough to be remembered, and kept safe, and regarding putting her ID, EGO, and SUPER-EGO, before those, who she ""supposedly LOVED, and CARED for/about. GROW-UP!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A Tale of Missing Values & Missing Parenting,"Our nation has come to this, after 200 years? A minus-10 would be a more accurate rating.A tale of drugs -- 'Acid 25' -- 'bad checks,' and casual infidelity. After Jefferson, Thomas Paine, Madison, Adams, President Jackson .......?I will never buy these persons' product or 'music'-making, in any format. I could not, in good conscience, support the source.To send your 17-year old daughter off to live with a 'room-mate' in San Francisco, who then takes up with a married man with children? (Today, he'd be on a 'predator list' on some website, if not arrested by the FBI for taking the minor female across state lines.) This young female was among the most beautiful produced by over 200,000 years of DNA effort among our tribe, and yet what was the outcome?The values and behavior portrayed here are beneath our great nation, our people, and our family lines. This tale made me want to join EURO, or some such traditional values effort, and quickly."
3,A Weak Look Into The Mamas And The Papas,I had always wanted to know more about this groupYes I knew the music but I still wanted to know more about the group on the insideMichelle does a decent job in giving some of the information in a very shallow wayShe should of gone a lot deeperIf you are going to write as she does here you need to give all the facts and tell the whole storyI am glad I read itAfter reading it I found that John Phillips had also written a bookIf you want the deep facts and goings on of this this group I would say pass on this book by Michelle and Go and read Johns bookI do want to say in any case The Mamas and the Papas were a great group .....
4,"Michelle Phillips' book almost as good as ""Papa John's""","California Dreamin' is a fascinating autobiography by a woman who's done it all. Lot's of dirt, and names named! If it's the group you're interested in, I'd suggest the book written by her ex-husband and the svengali of the group: ""Papa John""."
5,Loved it!,"Michelle's story is a interesting one...these folks really class-ified the 60s pop music scene, despite John's influence on the drug culture..I really enjoyed the read..."
1,DISAPPOINTED,I gave this airplane to my Grandson for Christmas.My son flew it first to show his son how it worked- My son told me it barely lifts off the ground. Does not fly well at all!!!!!!
2,My first attempt at eating vegetarian jerky,"The texture and toughness of the jerky was very close to the real thing. I was quite impressed. However, the flavor and after-taste left something to be desired. The only one i could eat was the Original Hickory... by far the best tasting of the sampler variety 8 pack. All of the others were inedible to me and my wife."
3,Not Very Good,"This is a mediocre overview of Ingres' work, but, unfortunately, the only one available on the market right now (besides the lilliputian taschen pamphlet). About half of the reproductions are good, the other half are washed out or badly printed. Most irritating is that a considerable number of the precious few color plates are given to the work of other artists... those are the ones that really should've been in black and white.UPDATE!!There is now a much better Ingres book available by Andrew Shelton... more reproductions, better quality, good price. Don't even bother with this one!"
3,Perilous...Not So Perilous,"This book is about twin boys who manage to get in a lot of trouble in one year. ""The Perilous Year"" sounds like a book full of tradgedys and harships, but it's not. Maybe to a 12 year old, but I think the name is too mature for the book. I didn't like the way the book was written, and it was a poor sequel to ""The Hungry Year."" Overall, the plot was OK and I'm sure younger kids would like it."
4,Essays inHumanism,This is the thoughts of a genius brain at work. Whether you agree or not it is very thought provoking and well worth the the time to read.Physics is not the only area of his knowledge.Jermone
2,"Disappointed, didn't finish reading it.","There really isn't too much to say. I was disappointed though & didn't finish the book. Having never read any of his writings, but hearing about his genius, I expected more. Though, it was titled 'Essays in Humanism', it needs the title changed to 'Socialism 101'."
1,Essays in Humanism Albert Einstein,"Terrible, I was surprise he supported socialism, and praised the USSR, that did it for me. When the government provides everything, people looses the initiative to work hard, I lived that in Cuba."
3,interesting but not enlightening,"This is one of those compiled works that is price sensative. There is nothing of depth in this work that would demand a price above $3. (Yes, i know, who am i to set a price?) This work is basically divided into two sections: letters/thoughts on scientific topics and letters/thoughts on socio/political topics. The first section is the best part of the book; but even then, the writing is easy and unchallenging. Still i enjoyed it; as i would enjoy hearing any genius address his field of expertise in layperson terms. As for the latter section of the book; well, let us just say that every person is allowed their opinion and that just because you are a genius in one field doesn't mean that you are gifted with insight into another.Basically; if you are interested in Mr. Einstein as a man, and the price is right, this is interesting. If you are looking for something that sheds light on Mr. Einstein as a scientist then i suggest you look somewhere else."
5,Essays in Humanism,"This is a wonderful and venerable older essay on Humanism. It probably was excerpted in my college texts on Humanism, but I wanted to read it in total. very interesting and worth the read."
4,Einstein's thoughts still apply to today's world,"""Essays in Humanism"" is a good sampling of Einstein's humanistic writings and the topics covered still apply to the world today. Einstein was an imminent scientist, but he was also very concerned about the many problems involved with advancing technology, particularly the possibility of nuclear warfare. I recommend the book to those who are familiar with his scientific expertise, but who want to learn more about his humanism."
4,Essays in Humanism,"Interesting view point of the over all Human experience,from his perspective. . . Many of his observationsare very relevant to many view points of contemporary Americans. The issue of Socialism is a bit overstated; with the ""World Order""/government point repeated through out the piece. . . Good reading forthe retrospective of the re-occurrence of social strife, and the blame it inflames in the population, oras seen by those whom observe dispassionately. . ."
5,Must read,Second to NONE. The beauty is that you don't need to be an Einstein to read and understand. Buy this. Read this. Understand this.
3,“Essays in Humanism by Albert Einstein,I love Albert Einstein but “Essays in Humanism” It is interesting book for those who are interested in politics and social problems.
4,interesting,"Just started reading. Found his subjects interesting, and I can his would be a good read for a lot of people"
2,Strange,Albert Einstein is not a gifted writer. His many gifts lie elsewhere. Made for difficult reading that sometimes made no sense.
4,Esssays in Humanism by Alber Einstein,"Einstein's ideas are great. I agree with his principles. But in the real world, there are too manyvested interests that will vigorously oppose and prevent the adoption of his ideas."
4,Easy Assembly,This wine rack is easy to assemble. Great to help store extra bottles for our kitchen wine storage rack under our stairs. May buy another later.
5,great ice cube tray,"The ice cubes come out beautifully - perfect cubes and intact (not chipped or cracked). To get them out, push each cube from the bottom with your finger.For fastest and easiest results, wait for 5 minutes after taking the tray out of the freezer. This way, the ice cubes will pop right out. If you don't wait, your fingertip will be freezing while trying to push them out."
4,a major improvement over plastic,You need to run some water over the tray or let it sit for a while or it's difficult to get the ice out without bending long fingernails. That said these are much nicer than my old plastic trays.
1,They stink!,"I have had these trays for 2 months and the worst problem is the smell they have. I have tried washing them, but to no avail. Does anyone have any hints for this problem? When the cubes melt in drinks it absolutely ruins the drink as it takes on the oder of the cubes. I also find it is very hard to get them out of the trays, bending, twisting - however reading other reviews, perhaps by letting them stand for a few minutes might help. Any help would be appreciated."
5,A good manual for treatment substance abuse,"This book includes very practical guidelines and charts and record forms for the therapist to apply to the patients with substance abuse. The format of the book is clear, precise and very readable !"
3,Interesting review of the spirit disciplines,"Dr. Willard presents a comprehensive examination of the historical and theological basis of the spiritual disciplines. Excellent blend of biblical examples and personal experiental to compliment the theme of this body of work. I believe this text would be most helpful to those questioning the roots for the exercise of the spiritual disciplines. It is not intended as a practical guide for the spiritual disciplines, it encourages the believer towards the challenges of discipleship and to realize the value as well as cost of discipleship. I enjoy Dr. Willard's perspectives and his observations, I look forward to read more of his books."
5,It will change your life.,"It redefines, or should I say returns to the proper definition of living abundantly through Christ."
5,Wonderful Concept,"The Spirit of the Disciplines: Understanding How God Changes Lives by Dallas Willard is a book of obedience to God and to the scriptures. According to the author we can become like Jesus if we follow exactly the way He lived and practiced the activities he engaged in. It seems to make sense, if one lives exactly the way Jesus did and arranged their life around the way Jesus lived than one would become as close to the fellowship with God as Jesus was. Ask yourself ""what would Jesus do"" than follow in His steps.+ + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +Are you a spiritual retard, or are you on the path to ENLIGHTENMENT?+ + + + + + + + ++ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +"
1,Heresy,"""When the devil wants to cause offense against the true doctrine and faith, he does not do so through insignificant people, who do not rate highly with the world, but through those who are the very best, the wisest, the holiest, and the most learned."" - Martin Luther."
4,Spirit of Dicipline,"a great source of spiritural disclipines, easy to understand and use in your daily life. great writing as ususal by Dallas Willard"
5,Out of the charts,"Wow... simply wow!!!. This book is the S#!!!!T. I really liked book 1, but this one I loved it. Gotta admit is not perfect though. Is a little confusing before the climax, but it's TOTALLY worth it. Kyle Ridner is a helluva Green Lantern. I have more respect for him now more than ever.I hate giving spoilers, so that's why I'm just saying in my very personal opinion that this is (for me) one of the most amazing and exiting JLA stories ever writen. Just give you a chance and read book 1 and 2. You won't regret it."
1,I wouldn't even give it one star,"I bought three PestACator 2000 Plus from Home Depot on 12-15-2010. I had a rodent in my garage that I was trying to get rid of. I put one in the garage and as an aggressive measure, I put two in the home so I wouldn't have a problem.However, I've recently notice some activity in the garage, on three different occasions all within the same week. According to the package insert ""This product is also backed by a one-year warranty on all parts and workmanship"". It's only been 4.5 months. I am extremely unhappy with the product. I would expect these items to last longer for the amount of money I have paid. I not buy this product, recommend this product and at any chance I get, I will discourage others from buying your product!"
3,I hope it works,"Bought 2 of these one for a rented gravel floor garage to scare mice and one the crawl space. Since they work thru the wiring, added some wire by using an extension cord as suggested in the instructions.I hope they work...bend"
5,Pestacator really works,"This little thing really works. We have a one story 3200 sf house and have put one in the front, one in the back, one in the garage, and one in the attic. Beware, however, like the directions say - when you first plug them in, there is a LOT of activity. It soon goes away and you are pest free. I have four dogs who are not bothered by them at all."
5,The mice are gone!!,"We were seeing/hearing mice on a daily basis, and had tried traps, poison and sonic devices. We purchased this device upon a recommendation from a friend, plugged it in, and have not seen or heard a mouse in over 2 weeks. It worked like a charm, and we couldn't be happier about it!"
1,The Mice Run Right By It,"We saw a mouse, bought this item and I've seen a few mice run right by the device. I don't think it does a thing."
5,It Works,"Now I was a bit skeptical at first. I was not familiar with the technology and science involved in how this really works. But I took a chance and low and behold it worked. I had a mouse problem at my home and I tried other methods such as the Nooski traps and poison. Although I killed over 12 mice with the traps, mice tend to reproduce quicker than you can kill them off. Also any mother mouse can have about 8 to 12 babies when they are prego.Mind you I have 3 Corgi dogs so I was worried about whether or not the frequency would bother them. But all was well the dogs don't seem to notice anything out of the ordinary and they are happy campers. This product worked so well that when my father was having mice problems at his place of business (not food related lol) I was confident enough to buy a unit for his office. End result is that I have zero mice issues both at home and in the office. It works well and I have no more trouble with rodents. :3 I give it a 5 star. Definitely worth a shot."
1,Repels mice? I think it brought more!!!,"I bought the pest-a-cator plus 2000 in February of this year and instead of repelling mice, I've got more mice than ever now...this thing did not work and would really like my money back. 26 bux for this thing thats not worth 5 cents to me"
1,Do't waste your money,"This is flat out a waste of money. I hear rats in my wall between my kitchen and bathroom so I placed this unit in the outlet between the two walls which includes wiring. Well, it's been over a month and we still hear them crawling throughout that wall. Just to let you know, my house is only 1000 sq ft. and this is suppose to be good for a house much larger then mine. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
5,Bit hit with my Gang of 5,I have 5 medium sized dogs. And they just love these chews. This is the only treat I buy for them. Since the pet food scare I bake all their treats. But I do still buy these. As they are natural dried Yams.they don't last very long (5 minutes if I'm lucky). But they are a bit hit. I give them each one a week to keep them busy while I unload groceries.
1,Moldy and overpriced!,"I bought these from a store without looking at the price and when I opened the bag, they were moldy. Interestingly, it appeared the mold had been dried along with the yams which means they came that way from the factory. Needless to say, they were returned and I'll never try them again. When I realized the steep price, I decided that I could easily make my own with a dehydrator, since the pooches LOVE yams."
3,Nice table book,"I expected that this book would have more content than it did. Basically it's just some short blurbs followed by some stunning looking pictures. I take it that it's supposed to be an amazing coffee table book, of some sort.The version I received a really high quality print with a very neat texture on the cover. It only took about 20 minutes to read the entire thing, so I feel a bit cheated on that part. But I still like having it around."
4,A forgotten gem.,I came upon this book in my library while looking for another book by an author with the same last name and first initial (his daughter?). This is a surprisingly detailed sketch of the history of phonetic changes in English. Not to be overlooked by students of the subject.
4,Make sure to order these !!!,"Make sure to order these !!! When you buy a card file, Bought four more of these packages to fill out my card file and hold all my current cards and allow room for my future cards as well. These are as good as they come and seem to be the excite card that comes stock with the unit.Price point is great and if you buy these with other items saves shipping on little items.Buy with confidence.RagenRat"
1,A Decade Of Hits? Ah...not quite,"Nothing fries me more than buying what you think is a hits compilation, only to discover when you've torn the packaging off and put it in your CD player that what it REALLY is is a re-recording of a person's major hits done 20 years after the original recordings, when a voice is completely different. Sure, Johnny covers a lot of his own songs here, but his range is gone, and in some places, it barely sounds like the Rodriguez we've come to know and love. I loathe people that have to resort to this kind of trickery to dupe the music-buying public into thinking they're getting the original, genuine article."
3,"Nice blocks, but package is MUCH SMALLER than it looks","I bought 2 packs of these with the intention of giving one to my daughter and one to my nephew. When they arrived, I could NOT believe how TINY they were. The two sets together were barely as big as I expected ONE set to be! (They count several VERY small pieces in their ""20 pieces"" count, including some tiny semi-circular and circular pieces that look to me like more scraps from the larger pieces than blocks themselves.) I was very disappointed in that and ended up having to put them both together to make one decent block set. I do like the blocks, but for $21, I really expected to get 20 blocks, not 9 or 10 blocks and a bunch of little pieces. It ended up costing me over $40 to get a decent-sized set. The picture of the girl building with them is VERY misleading as she is using AT LEAST 3 packages of blocks in that photo."
2,"Nice blocks, but package is MUCH SMALLER than it looks","I bought 2 packs of these with the intention of giving one to my daughter and one to my nephew.

3,It could have been great.,"This is not a bad cd. It has two of Vivaldi's best arias, ""Alma oppressa"" and ""Agitata da due venti."" Kate Eckersley does good work interpreting these. Elizabeth Wallfisch, of course, is an excellent violinist. Still, the main thing that really makes this a lackluster recording is the actual sound of the music. The sound seems very distant and there is a kind of reverberation. While the soloist comes through fairly clearly the accompaniment just sounds very far away. In short, it sounds like a concert given in a very large church with lots of echo. This actually is quite charming when you are in space itself, but on a cd the charm just isn't the same. This is not a bad recording and has some good pieces on it, but it would not be my first choice for any of these works."
4,Accessory Kit for DSC-S60,"The kit is very good, the bateries of 2500 mah are the best of this kit, amazing time without discharge. I really don't like the charger of the batteries, it's very unconfortable to carry with, because it's very width, but if you don't mind to carry it in somewhere else you really pay the money for this kit."
4,Has some good moments,"This albums kicks off with perhaps its best song, The Game, Wiley raps over the beat to perfection. With this album wiley has really tried to push the envelope with the beats which often sound like they belong more on an 80's computer game than on a Grime/2-Step/Eskimo record, but overall it does work.Some of the best songs on this album are Wot Do U Call It?, Doorway, Reason, Next Level (feat. a great verse from Kano) and Treadin on Thin Ice. You cant listen to this album from start to finish but the amount of quality tunes on this means it earns its four stars."
5,This book is based on my 40 years of interviewing experience,"During my 40 year career in business (Bethlehem Steel and Chase) and higher education (University of Virginia and Vanderbilt) I have conducted over 20,000 job interviews and over 2000 individual career counseling sessions. The best of my tips and advice is contained in this book. I hope it helps you get the job you seek.Peter Veruki Author"
3,Very general,"There are some good tips about strategies and about the importance of hitting on broad themes, but, like most books of its kind, it is too general to be of much value."
3,Very Useful,"As an Executive Recruiter, I found this book to be quite helpful. I was able to see the potential in all the questions and not only from an interviewers point of view, but as a candidate. I made a list of ""tough"" and ""my favorite"" interview questions and email them to my candidates and clients. This way they are prepared. I also suggest to my candidates that they use the questions as a guideline to formulate thier own questions for the company. An interview works both ways.I recommend this book as a staple for recruiters, HR Managers, and candidates. It's best to over prepare, than under prepare."
4,The 250 Job Interview Questions You'll Most Likely Be Asked,"Great questions. This really got me thinking. I loved the creative ones like, ""What Color is your brain?"" I went with green because I'm usually quite calm and I'm good at calming people down."
1,the worst ever product,I bought a 1998 Oldsmobile silhouette van Headlight(driver side)#20-5124-00 10368389.I did install it in my car and after three weeks and couple rainings I did check it and had 1/2 inch of water inside(looks like a fish tank).I wont ever recomend an item like this to anybody.I did waste my money.
2,TOOOO Basic,"I have camped a couple dozen times for a few days each time, and wondered what it was like and what was needed to really 'camp-out' long term. Don't think I learned anything new here. Was disapointed in the lack of depth on all levels. All info could use an update. I can easily find more info with a quick search on-line."
4,George Washington...did he tell a lie?,"All to often we believe what we would like to believe, especially when it's about the leaders of our country. However, recent events have taught us that the right circumstance can influence a leader to make decisions that have unspeakable consequences. In his book, Swantek shows us that even a leader such as George Washington, was not immune to these influences. He provides the facts (as we know them) while at the same time showing that the interpretation of these facts can change the course of history. He shows us that what often appears to be the truth is no more than what we want to believe. This is an excellent book for it factual accuracy and it's stimulating fiction. I can find no other book John Swantek has written so if this is his first, I look forward to his second."
2,Ice Maker ruined flooring,"This icemaker worked fine for 7 months, then the internal water line that feeds the icemaker failed, flooding my kitchen and part of my dining room. A service technician repaired the unit, since it was under warranty. Overnight, the same part failed, flooding the entire downstairs of my home, ruining hardwood flooring, and wood trim. I would not recommend this ice machine unless the design is improved.It does make clear ice very quickly and looks nice in the kitchen. It does not have a pump to remove water from the ice bin, so this has to be done manually, which is kind of a pain, especially if you are gone for a few days."
4,This beach adventure is especially great for 3-4 yr. olds.,The illistrations are beautiful. The story with all of sams questions and stellas imagination are right out of a preschoolers mouth. Fun summer reading.
4,Stella Star of the Sea Review,This book is a nice size for holding in young hands and has nice illustrations. It's probably helpful for the child to have a little familiarity with the common sea creatures in the story. My 7 year-old grandson read it to his 4 year old sister.
1,This does not work well on carpeted areas.,"I bought this to use on carpeted areas to lift up dog fur and hair before vacuuming. I have a similar rake that's hand-held and works well, but using it on an entire floor is hard on the back. I'd hoped this would work as well, but it doesn't. I've tried it in areas where my dog frequently sleeps, and it picks up very little fur. I've also tried it on the carpet below the bathroom mirror, where I stand when brushing my hair (which is long). It skipped right over the hair on the carpet."
3,"Prepare to use some ""elbow grease""","Really does do a good job of gathering up the cat hair from the carpet and furniture.... but it takes some effort. My major issue with it is that the rubber ""head"" is a bit too flexible, if the top of it were a bit more rigid -- I suspect it would take a bit less ""elbow grease"" to get the same effect. As it is the wibble-wobble factor when using it seems to add to the level of effort needed to get results."
3,pretty good,"This broom worked pretty well to remove pet hair, although you definitely do have to use some elbow grease. All in all, worth the price."
1,UselessProduct,"I ordered this product expecting it to do so much, but it did nothing for my carpeting with its rubber brushes. I packed it up the same night and shipped it back. I would never recommend anyone purchase this product."
4,Picks up fine pet hair!,This broom is great on hardwood/laminate floors and picks up even the finest dog hair. The only drawback is that it doesn't work with a dustpan so I need to grab my regular broom for that.
1,Did not like but to expensive to send back,"This was a waste of money. The broom did not work on my carpet. I did not pick up pet hair. The shipping was just as expensive as the broom, so I kept it. Maybe I will find some other use for it. Don't know what, but I guess it will sit in the closet until I do."
1,Disappointed in the FURemover,I just received the FURemover and started to work on carpet in my bedroom. I have several cats in the house and thought this might remove cat hair better than my vacuum. As I raked across the carpet the rake would pull cat hair from one spot to another but never picked it up in the rubber bristles. I still had to bend down and pick up each little clump from the carpet. A grooming glove works much better but not practical over a whole room. Seems the bristles should be stiffer. It's not at all what I hoped for.
5,Truly Amazing!,"I have a Samoyed, which means constant shedding! After a bath, you can literally shake out his fur with your hands and it looks like it is snowing! Even still, I never knew how much fur was on my carpet, even after vacuuming, until I used this broom. Every week I pick up enough hair to start a Locks of Love business for dogs! I don't know what I'd do without this broom!"
4,Love it!,"I have two long hair dogs and I use this broom on the hardware floors daily. It works wonders grabbing the hairs especially from the corners so I don't have to vacuum on a daily basis. I tried on the carpet and though it works, you need a little oomph when you sweep. All in all, my place is soooo much cleaner without the fur bunnies against the edges and table legs!!!!! Received it quickly. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that the top part of the broom where you could hang the broom on a hook was broken, but the broom itself works great!"
3,everholder broom,"I use this broom more outside, in gardens, flower beds, etc. It doesa good job, without hurting plant stems. Thank you - Betty"
2,Handle doesn't stay fully extended,"I actually like this broom, but I find it impossible to actually use. The handle has a telescope design, which would be nice for storage purposes, but there is no way to lock the handle in a fully extended position. So I end up holding the broom at the joint so that I force it to remain extended, or I use it bent over. Either way, I give up pretty quickly. The material that came with the broom is no help at all and mentions no locking feature. This thing is gathering dust now."
3,hard to use,"Maybe it's my dog's hair type, but you have to get it at the right angle and press hard for it to rake the hair."
2,Sweepa Broom,"I ordered this because someone I know has cats and just loves it. I am not a fan though. It does get the dog hairs but I have to sweep a second time to get the little stuff that goes between the bristles. I prefer to sweep one time so I have gone back to the ""old fashion"" way with a regular broom or the swifter."
5,Best broom I own,Does the job as advertised and even gets up sand. Liked it so well I bought two. I would purchase from this vendor in the future
3,meh,"It does pick up lots of fur, but you have to move it across your floor so slowly that it takes forever. it also makes a really weird noise as you're doing it, honestly my dog hates this more than the vacuum."
3,Fur Remover Reveiw,The construction quality is fine and the price is good however I have short tight pile carpet and this product seems more suited to long pile or shag. Limited ability to pull dog hair from my carpet. I have better luck dragging a rubber sole shoe across the surface with my foot then vacuuming up the dog hair.
4,Works good for long hair on carpet,"My wife's long hair always gets caught up in our vacuum's brush roll. This thing definitely helps with that. Before I vacuum, I briefly go over the carpet with this broom, and it picks up a lot of hair. There's still some left behind that gets in the vacuum, but it's a huge improvement. I also have a dog that sheds a lot. I haven't really noticed this broom picking up a lot of the dog hair, but it doesn't matter because the vacuum sucks that up just fine."
3,I was not very pleased with this rake,The design of the rake allows pet hair to be pulled from the rug and thrown in the air when you use short firm strokes. This is not very productive to picking up the hair and makes it hard to rake the hair into a pile.Overall I would not recommend this rake to others. There are more effective rakes on the market.
2,works when not breaking,"The rubber bristles work pretty well cleaning hard surfaces, everything from the bathroom and kitchen floors to the tiles on the porch. But the product suffers from two serious problems:1. The head falls off when brushing with too much friction. Cleaning thicker carpet, for example, will cause the head to get pried off. This is because it is only secured by bendable rubber.2. When extended, the handle bends and eventually cracks, leaving metal splinters. The handle is only sturdy when unextended, which would be too short to use.In short, I am trying to return this defective product, but will keep a look out for a better made version."
1,Not good for pet hair,"This product might be good for some things but I found it by doing a search on pet hair clean up and it does not handle this job either on rugs or on hard floors. I wanted something to pick the hair up, so I can pull it out and throw it away. I wanted it for quick use between vacuuming because my dog sheds constantly. All it does is move it around and does not even do that very well. To work with hair on a rug, I had to keep pulling the device over the same area several times to get a clump of hair piled up that I could then pick up. To do the whole rug would take much more time than going to the closet removing the vacuum cleaner, vacuuming and putting the machine away."
2,NOT the sweepa deluxe!!!,"I was disappointed when I received this broom since it is not the actual Sweepa Deluxe Broom -- it's a knock-off. If you want the actual product, don't order from this seller. When I complained, they offered to refund my money -- however, not the shipping & handling. Seems to me if you are not honestly advertising your product, and someone is not happy about it, you should be refunding ALL the customer's money, not just some of it!!!"
4,Works but not all it's cracked up to be.,"After extensive research on brooms that could pick up human hair (I am a girl after all!), I came across this broom and decided I would give it a try for the reasonable price. It works for the most part on my regular carpet (that's all I have used it for). My roomates and I have long hair so I use it to 'rake' up the hair and then I have to pick it up myself. I had somewhat higher hopes for the broom but all in all I suppose it works."
3,Useful tool,My kids like the way it works on the carpet and will use this just to play. I still have not figured how to use as a squeege or on the wood floor.
1,I don't own a pet,I bought this broom for basic hard floor cleaning. I have 2 kids one is 4 and the other is 1 and I sweep at least 5x a day. this broom is awful. It doesn't sweep well and it wont push the crumbs on to the dustpan. I bought this other one which is a million times better and does the job in no time.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032GEHAS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00hope that helps.
3,furemover broom,I was thinking of another product when I ordered this thinking it would be the same but it's just not as good as the one I was thinking of.
4,"Eh, does the job.","I'm not sure if it's just my technique, or perhaps it's the broom itself but it does the job we bought it for and I really can't complain about it.I still think scuffing my feet around with my sketchers on (the knobby soles rock for hair removal) did a better job but this is certainly easier.No complaints so far. Quality actually seems better than I expected considering the reviews.I'll probably buy another one if this breaks. I don't see it lasting a lifetime but it's better than nothing at this point."
5,Great Broom,Works just like described. I would recommend this item to any industrial type of setting that would need a broom of this size and rubber bristles.
1,Doesn't work on carpets,"Just got this and I'm so disappointed. I bought this as something to use between vacuuming. It doesn't work at all on the carpet, it just bumped along it and doesn't pick up any dog hair.It does work well on my hard floors, but that isn't what I bought it for. So if your looking for something that works on your carpets, this isn't it.And if anyone knows of a good product for cleaning up hair on the carpet, leave a comment! I would love some suggestions."
2,A step above just picking fur up with your hands,"A friend of mine has one of these and just loves it, so I thought I'd try it since my vacuum has trouble picking up fur from my very hairy cat. I am not impressed. The handle isn't a problem for me as it is for so many others, but it's the most inefficient cleaning tool I've ever encountered! I used it on one large living room and it took me an hour to get most of the fur out of the carpet. It literally would have been faster for me to just walk around and pick it out of the floor. The rake head is so small that you have to pull the fur off and throw it in the trash after every couple strokes. The one good thing? It's a work-out for the arms. Good thing it's cheap, because it's very close to worthless."
5,This is great on hardwood or tile floors. No complaints. Worth the money for sure.,This is great on hardwood or tile floors. No complaints. Worth the money for sure.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this to help remove the dog hair from the carpet and to spare wear and tear on my vacuum cleaner. I have 3 big dogs and they are always shedding. I spent 20 minutes on a small patch of carpet trying to rake/sweep up the hair. I could have done the job 10 times faster with the vacuum. I also tried this product on the bare floors. No luck. I had to go back over both the carpet and the floor with a vacuum/broom to get up all the hair and dirt. Very disappointing! And I'm out $20 (the cost of the product plus shipping). :\
5,Cat Hair Remover,This is the best investment I could have made!! I never realized how much cat hair remained after using the vacuum until I used this!! Now I feel like my carpet is actually clean.
1,1/2 a star is too much-useless,"If you have a vacum cleaner this is a waste. If you have a swifer this is a waste. As a matter of fact, a broom works better. This did not pick up any fur, and on the first attempt to extend the handle I discovered it was terribly hard to loosen and then never locked again. You can have the original less than a broom length or two seperate pieces. Had I not used an amazon gift card and free shipping I would have bothered to send it back, but it wasn't even worth the shipping.Please don't missunderstand that I do like this line of products. I may have gotten a dud. The other FURemover products require quite a bit of elbow grease but turned a cat bed that had never been cleaned in over a year to brand new shape. The gloves are also excellent. This particular product just does not serve a purpose. Because I am tall I plan on using it as an extra 18 inches to knock down spider webs and such on our deck."
1,Disappointed,"My first complaint is that the telescoping handle doesn't lock when extended. It stays put by pressure against the floor. That works until you lift it up and the bottom half slides out onto the floor. Maybe mine is broken? Not sure. Secondly, I haven't had great success with it picking up dog hair. Maybe my floors are cleaner than I think. Lastly, I read somewhere that it can be used as a pile rake for carpet. I found this to be far from the truth. It just bounces along the top of the carpet doing nothing to the pile."
4,"Pull, don't push","The Sweepa is turning out to be way better than a regular broom; the bristles don't wear out, you can rinse it under the tap, it extends to way longer than I need it (I'm 6' and there's lots of crappy brooms out there that are too short) AND, best of all, it keeps my 2 year-old occupied for at least 15 minutes at a stretch (just make sure to shorten the handle all the way).I even used it to squeegy the wood planks on my back deck after hosing it down.I'd give it 5 stars if it were maybe 2"" wider, but other than that, I mean come on. 11 bucks? You can't go wrong.NOTE: doesn't really work on carpets unless you have a lot of time on your hands. But for houses with lots of hardwood or tile, highly recommended."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,I was looking for a 2 in 1 broom and squeegee for my shower. I love the size and rubber. I think it was a bit expensive for what it is.
3,Cat hair,Works very well. I'm just disappointed in how large the brush is. It's difficult to get in certain places. Would love to trim about 3 inches.
2,Item Was not as Described.,It is barely able to move dirt or dust on carpet. I would look to another product. Not worth buying.
1,Something missing?,I bought this for a friend because he liked mine. He didn't tell me until just recently that the product arrived with about a 3 foot handle. No extension. He uses it anyway but what a pain in the a$$.
1,Nothing special,I cant see all the rave about this book. there is nothing special in this book and it barely contains any material. All of this info is either known to a person starting a business or can be found for free on the net. Not worth the $$ or time to read it. Wouldnt have ordered it if I knew what the book contained.
1,Would give it minus stars if I could,"This book is a joke - where are the rest of the 50 pages it would take to be a useful tool? I'm so sorry I bought it and have learned my lesson about buying books on line. It is unorganized, short, of no use or value. I think a 2nd grader could have written a more organized piece. A complete waste of money. Just goes to show you, you can scam anyone into buying or printing a book; that's where the money was made, not by cleaning. It is going in the garbage; hope someone out there is enjoying my wasted money - I want it back!"
3,Good Reference,"A good book, a bit monotone, maybe, but gives reliable resources on Pu-Yi. Just the thing for a school report, but not for enjoyment (I didn't think so). Note that the book was published in 1987, when Russia was still under Soviet control."
3,Propagandish with bits of history,"The first half of the book is interesting in that it gives some sense of the way an emperor lived and was influenced by his court and provides a description of historic events by the eyewitness. However, the second part of the book can only be read with a smile by anyone, like myself, who lived in the Soviet Union."
1,Huh?,"The shipping charges for this $9 bowl range from $16.79 for standard shipping to $55.79 for one-day shipping. This clearly makes no sense whatsoever, and must be an error, but when I tried to be a nice guy and explain that to an Amazon phone rep, he insisted the charges were accurate. I pointed out that I could pay $330 for shipping my six bowls, and he said that was correct and perfectly in order. I then pointed out that one of us was, without doubt, a moron."
2,concerned,"If it's important please don't attach it in such a way that if you try to read said note it's destroyed, Xs 4 !!"
4,bought as a gift,I have always liked .Corelle. My daughter wanted the simple black band pattern of dinnerware so I added this to her set. Disappointed that not all dishes come in this pattern; some had to be bought in plain white.
4,A must have if you have Duplo,"A base plate will make Duplo easier to use for your toddler. It provides a great base for their structures and towers. And if they want to keep their ""masterpieces"" up for a few days it makes it very easy for you to pick up the entire structure and put it somewhere safe until the next day. An fantastic accessory for any Duplo set."
3,also fits Primo baby legos,"I think this board is an essential accessory for any Duplo set. Our Primo baby legos also fit very well on the plate; they lock onto a block of 4 Duplo pegs. My 20-month-old son is not as impressed with it as I am. He likes to play with it sometimes, but he still prefers to build stuff without the board. That may change over time. My son has dented the pegs in many places by banging his lego pieces against it."
3,More Flimsy Than I Would Have Expected,"I bought this for my son, who loves playing with his Duplo legos. It's thinner plastic that you would expect given how sturdy the Duplo blocks are. As a result, if your child has built something and wants to move it somewhere (and that never happens with toddlers and pre-K, right?), unless you slide it or slide a firm, flat object under it, the structure built atop it will tumble. Overall, it's still nice to have, just not as good of a product as I would have expected, especially for the price."
5,great for our project,"We bought this and used gorilla glue to mount it onto a little table we bought at IKEA. We have 5 boys and we originally made it for our oldest, who is now 6. Consistantly, our 2-3 year-olds LOVE this smaller, cheaper version of a lego table. We keep a bin of the dulpo legos under the table, and it has been played with for countless hours. Even my older boys still use it on a regular basis. It's been a great investment."
3,alot thinner and bendy than expected,"This surely is not the base I remember from childhood. Due to cost-cutting or overseas production, this base is thin and bendy. Does not appear sturdy and reliable.Does the job, probably expected to be glued down to a table?"
4,Don't be fooled...it's a DUPLOS building plate!,"This product is titled as a 'LEGO Large Green Building Plate.' If I had taken the time to look at the actual image, I would've realized that this product was for DUPLOS (a LEGOs product, but not for the LEGO size blocks which I actually was interested in). When I opened the box and saw that it was a DUPLOS building plate I was shocked. I went onto Amazon and sure enough the picture showed DUPLOS, but the product title didn't mention DUPLOS at all. I felt like the product name could be made clearer since other DUPLOS building plates actuallly had DUPLOS in the title (but this one didn't). Fortunately, we can use this DUPLO building plate, but now I still need to purchase a true LEGO (large size) building plate for actual LEGOs. The mistake is mine, but I believe Amazon needs to change the listed product name so others don't make the same mistake."
2,this is for the plate only,I must admit I didn't read the description like I should have. I thought the blocks were included but this is for the PLATE only. And it does not work with the smaller blocks.
2,only for collectors,"From the name and Johnny Winters reputation as one of the great guitarists of all time, I thought that this might be good. Big mistake, the sound of this cd is the worst sounding I have ever heard. It sounds like a home made tape at times. First disc is a curious blend of very mid sixties style rock and roll kind of like beatles or beach boys music not blues. Most of it is forgettable. The second cd is live and mostly blues. The sound is awful but it contains the sets only redeeming value. Some of Johnnys true briliance shines through, it sounds mesmorizing at times. But overall do not buy this unless you are one of those collectors that must have everything Johnny has out."
5,simply amazing,"I stumbled on the Bravia commercial featuring this song and was mystified. The visuals were beautiful, but trivial without José's accompaniment. Not knowing much about José I didn't really pursue his music ... until ... a couple of years later, he played a show in Columbus. The show was in a tiny space making the entire experience absolutely amazing. José has pure talent that just oozes when he is on stage. It was a simple setup so the entire focus was on Jose and his music. You could hear a pin drop between songs because every human in that room just wanted it to keep going. I was amazed when I first heard his music, but hearing him live blew me away. True talent - I am in awe of this artist."
2,Maybe it's just me ...,"We've had Maisy's Christmas at my house for a couple of years and read it all year long.When one of our friend's named her first daughter Maisy, (and knowing the mom as well as we do) Maisy Goes Shopping was a no-brainer.Unfortunately, it's about the Grocery Store, not Maisy at Macy's (or the like).Just helping you manage your expectations.~Doc"
3,NOT what i expected.,"The package says human hair, but as someone that has used many brands of human hair over many years, this is probably the worst quality of ""human hair"" I have ever seen. It looks AND feels like synthetic hair, so ah duh, I'm gonna guess that's what it is... although the package says it is Premium Human Hair. I've been braiding hair for over 10 years and this is definitely not 100% hair. Then again, you get what you pay for.I will say, however, that I bought this hair and it arrived in 3 days. (great on the seller's part.. thank you!) but as for the product itself, I won't be purchasing it again. I went ahead and used this hair on myself and my braids look fine, as they usually do.. but I can definitely notice a difference when I play with it. My braids have been in for about 2 weeks now and they still look good.. so if you don't mind a majority of a synthetic hair as opposed to human hair (blend), then go for it. But you've been warned!"
4,"Great quality, just dont get it wet!","The quality of this hair is GREAT! I've had my braids for nearly 6 months and I dont look a hot mess. My only complaint...well it may be common sense stuff, but. When I went swimming, the brown dye went dripping EVERWHERE. I was horrified!!! I had a white towel drying my hair all sexy then to see brown dye everywhere, I nearly died!! So moral of the story...good quality hair, just dont get it wet..in PUBLIC!"
2,Average,Despite bringing back the Linn Drum machine Prince doesn't really add anything here.it's a fairly safe song made for radio.Prince could do these Ballads in His Sleep.very basic Arrangements that unlike the 80's don't always work nowadays.the Lyrics are interesting though.the mixes don't really add much to a ordinary song from an Artist that is Capable of so much more.
3,"an Acceptable Read, but Lacking","WHile Digimon was on TV, I was a diehard fan. I saw ALL the shows and kept oragnized lists of Digimon, etc. SO of course I jumped at the chance to buy a manga and relive my Digimon adventure (corny, I know).However, once i read it I felt very unstatisfied. It follwed the television show exactly (up to but not including the fight vs. Devimon, but they did not get to the same depth of character that the television show did, and that was the main reason I liked Digimon so much. I felt that the storyline in the manga was very rushed in order to fit the page requirements. It was a lot less detailed; mostly just fighting and wise-cracking jokes.If you have never watched the television show then this is a good manga because it introduces you to the wonderful world of Digimon. However, if you are a long time or die-hard fan, than I suggest sticking to the television show."
4,An Interesting Read,"I bought this because I missed the Digimon cartoon show so much. The artwork is pretty good, but since this isn't a Japanese manga, rather a Chinese manhua, it will be a little different than what many readers may be used to.The story follows the cartoon almost to the letter, with small scenes cut or added to add humor and move the story along.Overall, if you're a moderate to die-hard Digimon fan, I recommend picking this up to relive some of joy of watching the cartoon, since it doesn't seem like Disney will be releasing DVD season sets anytime soon."
5,DIGIMON DIGITAL MONSTERS ! MY FAVORITE,"I LOVE DIGIMON! it's the BEST. i didn't get this one yet but i sene them all on Fox Kids and i have them on tape to. But i like the japanese Digimon books better even thow you can't under stand them FUNNY. But their in COLOR! and thier realy! realy! cool! But their realy heard to find thow. But i also recamend for Teens Dragon Ball/Z, and Zatch Bell."
5,worth every penny,"I got this as a Christmas present for myself and I'm just so pleased with the quality. You can tell that a lot of care was put into the choice of materials and design. Everything fits together just so and feels right as I move around the kitchen.The wok itself is outstanding, same luster as my Matfer Bourgeat pans before seasoning. So far it's responding beautifully to cleaning and seasoning.Edited to add:It's working out exactly like the Matfer pans. Fantastic wok. The rest of the kit is up to scratch as well.I also wanted to mention superfast shipping. My wok was sent out the day after I put the order in. It arrived two days later. Everything was carefully packed so nothing was dented or damaged.They also included some freebies I'm very happy with -- long bamboo kitchen chopsticks, a bamboo wok paddle, a recipe book, and a collapsible back scratcher! Very sweet."
2,I don't like it,"I seasoned it per the instructions, but it only cooked right the first time I used it. If I have to do that process over and over again I don't think I will be happy with it. It was pricey, but I do enjoy cooking in the wok. I probably should return it for a different wok"
5,WATCH IT!,This is worth a watch. My husband is the one who got me into anime's and this is one of my favorites! It's got a really good story and makes you not want to watch anything else until you finish the whole thing.
3,Yawn... Bad boys? Not even misbehaving...,"Story 1 was OK. Nothing spectacular, but an OK read. Story 2 was the one I found most enjoyable... at least until the end. The backstory cleaned up nicely in a paragraph while the heroine sat at home. Pu-leeze. Story 3 was horrible. Overdone drama and a hero that taunted his prey with ridiculous prose and riddles before eating them... and that was the hero. This one was so bad I couldn't stomach reading it.Overall it was OK, but I'm glad I didn't buy it new."
1,Viagra & vampires,"This trite & ill concieved anthology is only just saved fromthe recycling bin by the presence of a fairly readablenovella by Rosemary Laurey.Rebecca York's offering involves an emasculated creatureof the night, whose use of viagra makes him about asdarkly erotic as a piece of wet lettuce.This is a sad, & frankly time wasting bit of nonsense fromthe previously enjoyable Bad Boys series.My advice, save your money for those writers like Angela Knight,Laurell Hamilton, Sherilyn Kenyon & Maggie Shayne whovery definately know how to play in the paranormaldarkside"
2,"Was expecting so much more from a ""Bad Boys"" book","I have bought all of the ""Bad Boys"" anthologies and loved them. This one in no way compared to the others. Night Extasy and Velvet Night were good but not great, and I love paranormal romances. I have read better and frankly expected much more from a ""Bad Boys"" collection. The last story was awful. I completely agree with Traci King. The story was hard to read, I often found myself going ""What?"". And to top all of that off, there was no romance! I would suggest readers skip this book or at least the last story, save their $14.00 and go with a Christine Feehan, Angela Knight, Sherrilyn Kenyon, Christine Warren or Karen Marie Moning."
5,BMFM Rocks!!,I loved this show as a kid. It is reminecent of TMNT. I wish it was out on DVD in the States. They just don't make shows like this anymore.
2,Better books available,"I was quite disappointed when I got the book and read it. The book focuses mainly on growing grapes in England, and some of the information in the book is not all that accurate. For example, when the author talks about pruning, he only mentions spur pruning. There are grape varieties out there whose basal buds are not fruitful where cane pruning is required.The only satisfaction that I got from the book was that someone was successfully growing grapes and making wine in less space and in a less favorable climate than I am."
3,Cute costume but runs super small,I bought this product in size Large for my Golden Retriever. She is 60 lbs and the costume was still too small for her. Cute costume but didn't fit. I couldn't return it since I had my dog try it on(they don't accept returns if it has any evidence it was touched by an animal).
4,Adorable!,"This was just so gosh darn cute on my black pug! Loved it! Because of the reviews I read about this running small I decided to go for a size Large even though 'small' was the recommendation for Pugs. But he is stocky, pudgy pug so I was worried about getting something too small. Large was definately too big for a Pug, even a fat one(22-25lbs). I was able to sew it up a bit so it was still quite usuable and adorable but a Medium would be the most ideal size."
2,Mine was missing its lid too,"I was hoping that somehow the ones that had been received without lids were flukes, but mine came that way too. Bummer! Would have been useful otherwise, even though I don't have a grill!"
1,Very disappointing,"I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED in this CD. Seeing as I had to give it a rating to submit this review, I gave 1 star. It isn't even worth 1/2 star. The CD is a recording of a performance inside a building, not a studio. Volumn varies to it's very hard to hear the music, most times not at all, like you are supposed to on a CD. It should not be recommended to buy with the ""Twilight"" soundtrack. And, being a CD, that had to be opened to listen to, I cannot return it. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
3,Debussy: Clair de lune & other favourites,I was a little disappointed with this version of Clair de lune. Ok CD
5,Oh Clair de lune,Very very soothing cd and wonderful sound quality I recommend this with a good book and a glass of good wine
1,Wonderful pieces but poor audio quality,"The music is good and great piano playing but the audio is poor. It sounds like it has been done in a low budget studio. I would have to guess because the recordings are from the nineties and the equipment was not the best, who knows? I suppose all you would need is a steinway piano a high quality mic and good sound engineer to make it the audio amazing which does not take much for this kind of recording. Anyways I would suggest trying to get something that has been recently recorded."
5,Cute story and wonderfully illustrated,My 8 year old loved this book when I first read it to her at age 5. She still enjoys the book and reads it to her 4 year old sister. Haven't tried the strawberry tea and chocolate tarts yet but we plan to some day.
3,Stick with the vocal music,"The two vocal works, ""Incipit Vita Nova"" and ""Glorious Hill"", are captivating and beautiful, and I give them 5 stars. However, the two ""jazz""-oriented instrumentals, ""Four Elements"" and ""Sub Rosa"", drone on excruciatingly (and I'm a Morton Feldman fan, not in principle opposed to slowly evolving patterns)."
5,Love this product,I have very sensitive skin and have never been able to use a toner. This product is gentle and non acidic and I see a definite reduction in pore size and overall improvement in my skin. I will order this product again.
4,Lots of get-started examples,"John is a natural teacher and a good writer. Reading his books is like having a mentor talking to you, providing tips and ""did you know what I discovered when I did this?"" kind of hints. Given the breadth of Windows 2000, many of his examples are broad rather than deep, but he does do some in-depth ones where needed---for MTS/MSMQ for example. The one nit I had was that his installation chatper focused on using InstallShield and didn't even mention the Windows Installer. However, there are plenty of examples and time-saving hints that make up for this. I've discovered lots of utilities I didn't even know existed. I also liked the example of building a MMC snap-in."
3,Windows for the C++ Programmer but Not a Windows Overview,"The title of this book might lead you to believe it presents an overview of Windows 2000 from a programmer's point of view. This book misses the ""50,000 foot"" overview information about Windows 2000 (what is it? how is it different from Windows 95? what is the impact of Windows 2000 on me? etc.) but does provide a wealth of information to the fairly technical C++ programmer who's interested in windows api, com/dcom, mts, active directory, and windows dna."
2,This book is unfortunately out of date with incorrect facts.,"John Coborn has written some very good books but this one gets the two stars from the brilliant photos. The species doesn't get their english name by the pictures, only by taxonomy, and those are some times incorrect. Incorrect maximum lengths for the species some times as well. John Coborn could have done it better."
1,Disappointing,"The title held great promise, but as a practitioner with over 18 years experience in power projects and project finance deals both at home and in some pretty difficult countries, this book was a let down. It approaches the subject from a theoretical point of view and it is clear that the author has little first hand experience in negotiating and closing deals."
3,Anybody who doesn't like this book,"Please provide me with books that are really helpful in the area of Energy, Power finance in emerging markets. contact me at fininfo@mail.com thanks."
3,(C+),"This is a moderately entertaining mystery, the story is well paced, the dialogue is clever, and the setting has vivid color and depth. The weaknesses are in the uninspired plot, the unlikable and weird characters, and their highly unconvincing motivations (except for the cat, which is by far the most enjoyable character).We are supposed too believe in the main character who has a PhD in English from Berkley, is an unlicensed private investigator, and a Tie Chi master. He's also broke, drunk, slovenly, mentally unstable, anti-social, and not to bright. But he has a nice cat. The supporting characters are even less believable for the most part, and just as mentally unbalanced, particularly his mother.Also the Law Enforcement aspects to the novel are particularly weak, as a former Lawman I was not impressed.OVERALL SCORE: (C+)READABILITY: (B+), PLOT: (C-), CHARATERS: (B+), DIALOGUE: (B), SETTING: (A-), ACTION/COMBAT: (C-), ANTAGONISTS: (C-), ROMANCE: (B-),AGE LEVEL: (PG)"
2,Big Red Tequila,"I chose this book after viewing an interview with the author and the editor of Texas Monthly.To tell the truth, this book was slow to develop and didn't have many surprises.I would not read another book by this author. I will try someone else next time.The service from Amazon and the book seller was great the book was the let down."
2,It can't be this easy to win an Edgar!,"Aside from the cat, there's not an original thing about Tres Navarre. Too many characters, too much plot, too little action. I didn't care if he found the girl or not,if he found his fathers killers or not. I just finished the thing and I still don't understand why these people did half the things they did. If the ending was suppossed to make me gasp, it made me yawn instead. Tres keep visiting the same people over and over again and comes away emptyhanded. If it's this easy to win mystery awards I might start writing my own. In the meantime I'll stick with, Dennis Lehane, Robert Crais, Robert Parker etc."
2,"Designed to be trendy, but boring","A toughguy who likes Tai Chi - how unpredictable. No, really. Oh, and he has a beautiful but neurotic ex, and then a stable ex, and there's supposed to be drama. And then he investigates some plot retired from old episodes of Dallas twenty years ago. This isn't badly written, and if you haven't seen through Robert Parker yet, maybe you'll still enjoy it, but to me it was predictably ""unpredictable"" and devoid of any real reading value."
3,I must be missing something.,"This one was a struggle for me. I never felt like I got to know any of the characters, and thought there were too many of them. The whodoneit was never clearly defined for me. I could not assuredly decide what crime was being solved. It just failed to explode for me. Since it won both an Anthony and Shamus award in 1997 I will give his ""Widower's Two Step"" a shot later this summer. It got nominated for an Anthony and Shamus and won an Edgar. The setting of the scenes and the Texas atmosphere were well done, but the dialog and characters escaped me. I would rather read James Lee Burke or Robert Crais."
4,"Good effort, entertaining read.","Riordan's debut of his series character, Tres Navarre, is a competent mystery written with evocative Texas imagery and a good sense of humor. It remains entertaining throughout- good dialogue, interesting characters, enough violence to be satisfying but not enough to push gratuitous.The novel's weakness is its complexity. For a lighthearted mystery, a perfectly good genre into which this book should easily fall, there are too many characters to keep track of, and Riordan does not give the reader quite enough reminder/clues to keep it cohesive. Only this prevents it from being a great travel companion.I look forward to the rest of the series."
4,TEXAS TALE,"A good yarn with the protagonist Tres Navarre (unlicensed PI - that alone can get you killed) and his enchilada-eating cat named Robert Johnson. Tres returns home to San Antonio and stirs up the dust and finds himself confronted with Texas gangsters,construction fraud, murderers and a lot of people that would like to see his body (and his girlfriend) disappear into the Texas Badlands. The book keeps flowing and held my interest, and convinced me to have another tequila and a side of tacos."
1,Scam Job!,"This is a total ripoff by whoever is selling this item! 30 Pounds?! What are stuffing this thing with dog food for me? These bins are at most 5 lbs. and can be shipped to you for as cheap as $7 from elsewhere (Petsmart, Target). The seller is just tryin' to make an obsurd amount of $$$ off of shipping!"
4,John Reuben - 4 1/2 stars for Talented Rhymer/Rapper,"John Reuben is in a class all his own.If I were to put him in a group with any one group or singer, it would be KJ-52, who are in my mind the two best rappers in Christian music.It's amazing how he can blend such silly tunes, funny (and clever) lyrics and his comical voice. He is pherhaps the goofiest singer in all of music today.But dont take that for weakness. John Reuben, ""Professional Rapper"" (as he very much is)is very good at what he does. But he also loves God, as you can tell. And he gets that message across through each funny song. He will be a joy to your music collection."
2,A for Effort,"The first thing I will say is that the only thing that this album has going for it is the production. The production gets about a 3 and a half to 4 simply because most christian rap has poor production and beats(KJ-52). As for John's rapping? Honestly is wasn't even mediocre. The way things are with hip-hop these days, the focus is on the lyrics. Everything is like a freestyle battle, and though he's not going to be abel to sit there and diss everybody, he has to be able to put words together cleverly. This isn't the eighties where pretty much anything that rhymned and had a decent hook got in. To call him the christian eminem would be so gross an understatement it would be criminal. Go out and by a Jay-z album if you want quality hip-hop."
4,Wrong size,"I guess it's my fault, but this is not the size I wanted. I wanted the size for business cards, and this is larger. It doesn't fit in the Rolodex business card file I got. These are huge."
3,Deadendz & Dung- America's most,"Over the years I have easily spent thousands of dollars collecting all this band has ever had to offer.Right down to a pair of TKK panties!So, naturally I had to buy Diamonds & Daggerz (along w/ the DVD and ""Be/\st of"").I wasn't expecting all that much, and I didn't get much.The greatest track is ""Dope Kult"", other than that the trax just don't go anywhere.I write this not to deter you from buying it;Buy the damn thing!! They deserve the money!!!,But I write in hopes that they realize the ridiculous hold they have on me and other fans is quickly fading.An intervention if you will.Buzz, Groovie, you are so much better than this!!You are so much more than repetitive Rebirth programing, or an opening band for old, worn-out industrial bands!!!It's a shame the world never fully realized how astonishing the Kult is, but now is not the time to give up!Come on.....be one of us again!!(The artwerk is really great anyway)"
5,So THIS is what the Devil Does?,"I have been a fan of TKK as long as some of the posters on this site probably even a bit longer. I have been with them through all of there evolutions and live shows (13 and counting). And yes, like every fan I have been disappointed but more often blown away i.e. Hit & Run Holiday and 13 Above the Night among my most played.My biggest complaint is that there label never seems to try and bring any new listeners on board when their sound evolves. Hit & Run would have been a perfect time to bring on the Sixties Soundtrack Revival that was going on i.e. Vampyros Lesbos and the loyal gay fanbase but they didn't.Anyway, Diamonds & Daggerz is exactly where they have been moving to and I LOVE IT. Fantastic pulsing grooves, sexy samples, overall great dance music. More, more, more please and thank you.LONG LIVE THE MINDWAY!!!!!"
3,I agree,"I too really hope Groovie mann and buzz realize that this hold they have on us will fade. i didnt expect anything from this album and i got nothing but songs are exactly the same as golden pillz and luna. i went to see them last time they were around with pigface and it was just groovie mann and some dude on a keyboard thats it. it totally sucked. i will be seeing them again on the ""evil doers"" tour which i hope will be better than the last time. I will be able to call it a good show if at least i see LEVI LEVI up there groovin to the bass line but im not expecting much. Get with it TKK. Just pump out some of that old darker funk that you used to put out. Get back to the genius samples sexpot riffs that we've all grown to love. i really dont want to have to bail on you."
2,Read better,"Sorry to say that this book ""stunk"" from the start! I've read 100's of books and this one didn't make my favorite by far. The writing was choppy and the story just went on and on and on. Sorry! This is just my one opinion, and obviously others loved it."
4,It's a 4.3...,"The Marriage Bed is a great book. But throughout it I wished I could jump right in the book and shake both Spencer and Olivia. They irritated me, Olivia being too nice and innocent and Spencer just being too grief ridden to care about anything but his own pain. But even with those annoyances I made allowances for them. With Olivia I seen that she finally learned to care about and stick up for herself. With Spencer he redeemed himself 100%. He knew what a big mistake he made (and it was a HUGE mistake) but he stopped at nothing to get her back. I would recommend it to anyone."
5,Stephanie Mittman is the best!,I read alot of romance novels and Stephanie Mittman is one of my all time favorites. She will write a book that will make you laugh and cry. I couldn't wait until I finished the book. The book made you feel sadness for both Spencer and Olivia. Spencer--because he couldn't let go of the past and Olivia--because she always loved this man from childhood. But love won in the end and Spencer realized that life was just to precious to let the ones that came into his life go. Must read.
2,The 'lady' mentioned in the other reviews,"First of all, I didn't really enjoy the album all that much. I do like keyboards, and I do like Flower Kings et al., but I also enjoy harmonical complexity. I find the tracks on the CD not to be developing anywhere, the lyrics are poor, the melodies are boring, and some of the songs just drag on pointlessly with identical repetitions of themes.What I do enjoy is that it's a very personal album, and Mr Ludin's courage to have his daughter intervene on the album (she's the much-criticised 'lady' in the other reviews here) is laudable!"
5,How To Prevent Falls,"As an clinical administrator for residential services for an older population, I have seen first hand the devastating effects of the fear of falling on older people. Betty Perkins-Carpenter has provided a direct, easy-to-use approach to improving balance for seniors. How To Prevent Falls offers a life of continued independence and dignity for people for whom both are easily lost. It can provide the basis for activities of daily living program for seniors centers, and residential facilities. As people remain more independent the staff can focus their services on enhancing the quality of life. It is MUST reading for every person who has influence on or cares for a senior citizen."
5,I plan to order more for elder friends and family,"Simple and easy to understand exercises, progressing from very easy to moderately easy. Good for the frail elderly to the moderately fit or at-risk senior. Simple drawings demonstrate the activities. Large print is easy on elder eyes. As an occupational therapist, I recommend this as a gift to share with a dear elder."
1,Not what I expected,"The cover of the book includes the words ""Easy to use 6 Step Balance System"". I assumed there would be 6 exercises that I could do every day.The book actually contains 14 stretching in bed exercises, 24 balance exercises, 8 ball handling activities, 6 warm up exercises,and 2 how to fall safely exercises. This is 54 exercises, not some rather simple set of things that can be done daily to improve balance.I would say that the book is designed for an older person who has been very inactive. It leads the person through an entire regimen of exercises with a goal of getting the person active. A noble effort.Being one who already attends a gym three times a week, I was hoping for a handful of exercises that I could use to help me increase my balance. Sorry, I have to give it a low rating."
4,excellent book,This is a very helpful book on balance and preventing falls. I purchased one for myself and one for my Mom.
2,Too many exercises and a few important omissions!,"Some good exercises although perhaps too many recommendedHowever I would recommend including the following:1. What to do once you have fallen ..when to stay there, how to get up2. Exercises for the vestibular and proprioceptive system on foam /thick carpet with and without vision .{Well done though for including gaze stability in your exercises}3. More preparation of speed and agility regarding stepping reactions in all directions"
5,BUEN LIBRILLLO,Esencial para mi trabajo en el campo de la comunicación. Aunque se que existen muchos más completos. Es un buen precio por un libro necesario.
4,A thouroughly useful and interesting dictionary,"A good dictionary with clear defitions plus the derivation of the word. I find having the etymology of a word in any language very useful in understanding its meaning. This dictionary provides this. It does not provide any sense of the history of the word and the changes in useage through time, which is a pity, but understandable in a book of this length. Compared to the Concise Oxford Dictionary in English, for example it is very thin in its exploration of the meanings of the word, but often much deeper on the etymology."
4,Fantastic cult doc,"The Jouberts are one of my favorite wildlife documentary teams. They're stories, both on the screen and in person, are some of the most fascinating tales of the Circle of Life I've ever heard. This is one of those documentaries that spawned all that followed. For the time period, this documentary is easily one of the best shot, produced and told."
5,Amazing documentary,"Riveting. This documentary follows a pack of hyenas and a pride of lions in their competing territories. It shows in detail their brutal battles against each other and competing clans of their own kind. I gained a greater appreciation and understanding of both species, but be warned - it's not for the feint of heart. Beautifully filmed and narrated, a must see for any one who enjoys these types of animal documentaries."
4,Good documentary,"The jouberts deliver again with this wildlife documentary. I give it five stars because i found it to be well informed, beautifully filmed and wonderfully narrated, all the ingredients for a good documentary. I am the type that likes to see gore even though that may be too graphic for most but i prefer to see the animal being eaten because as graphic as it is i find that important for me. Anyways there is alot of action in this one and i recommend it!!"
5,Dramatic,"What an amazing amount of drama and action for a documentary!This movie is so brilliantly done, it transcends the genre of documentary in my view.Watching the lioness with her cubs, you would think the lioness would be safe, yet danger comes from unsuspecting sources. The narration is brilliant throughout, with the narrators torn by what happens with these animals they observe for some time."
3,Qualité d'image décevante!,"Ce documentaire est surement le meilleur documentaire animalier qu'il m'est été donné de voir, mais la qualité du DVD est scandaleuse. j'avais acheté la cassette VHS au moment de la sortie de ce documentaire et l'image était de bien meilleur qualité; c'était édité par Warner Bross. j'ai tellement aimé ce documentaire que je voulais le conserver en DVD. C'est vraiment dommage que National Géographic n'est fait aucun effort de ce cté là."
2,Stretched thin,"2 1/2Garbarek's mid-east foray accounts for some interesting background, but feels over-indulgent and underwhelming when agreeable airiness gives way to repetitious bi-cultural bloat."
5,Wonderful,"This was a mother's day gift from my daughter, and a first shot at Reynolds Price. I loved it. This author understands small places in the south. As a mother (and this is in the very first paragraphs of the novel), I just couldn't fathom how Kate Vaiden could have abandoned her child when he was just a baby, and ""down for a nap."" But Kate's life certainly explains it. Understanding why she abandons her child doesn't make it easy to forgive her. It's great that Reynold Price tells the story in the order he does, because you keep asking yourself, ""how could she possibly have done such a thing, and how can she ever be redeemed?"" The expressiveness in the dialogue is especially great. Kate Vaiden's story will linger for a long time; I feel better for having experienced it. And bravo to a male author who can write from a female protagonist's perspective like this."
2,Kate Vaiden: Drag Queen,"While I would never assume that a man couldn't write in a woman's voice, Kate Vaiden sorely tempts my judgment. Reynolds Price tries to capture the female voice and consciousness of his narrator Kate and fails wildly. Kate is so laughably unconvincing that I thought perhaps I had misread it. However, when I showed the book to several other women, they all agreed. Kate is so clearly what a man envisions a woman to be (and so clearly NOT a woman), that I'm tempted to call the book a post-modern attempt at drag, and badly done at that. While there is some nicely honed prose, the story itself relies too much on contrived plot twists and thoroughly sentimental epiphanies. The dull story aside, the real interest lies in Kate's voice. Like a poorly rehearsed ventriloquist act, Kate Vaiden betrays its author's voice and bizarre conceptions of feminity again and again, transforming the novel from unintentional parody into high comedy."
3,"Sure it's lovely, but why keep reading?","Kate's narration is tight and sweet. Her analogies are completely original, ""the dogs spread out like a stain,"" ""it was silent as rocks."" Beautiful.And so promising, up through her parent's death. But then...meh.Just being lovely and Southern and coming-of-age will keep a lot of ladies reading, I bet. But, there just didn't seem to be any more conflict to resolve. I mean, Kate says there will be, I guess there is more to know about her parent's death,and why she didn't keep her baby, but it is too slow coming and satisfactory answers are too easily guessed at.Authors need to meet more a little more than halfway. Give me a reason to give you my time and attention, besides being lovely and lyrical."
3,Not a Ghost Story!,"This is a very interesting guide to where to find the artifacts and unexplained relics of Cornwall. It includes a short synopsis of the story or folklore of the subject and then tells where it is located in Cornwall. It's almost a visitor's guide, but with the legend behind each place. A must for those visiting Cornwall. It includes lots of pictures and drawings but alas, with only 72 pages (including the index) it does not go into much depth."
3,You can tell it's very old,"You can hear Steely Dan growing in there somewhere, but it was before they developed into something great. Good first effort."
5,mattress protector works,"I bought a couple of these when I adopted my new puppy (he and his older brothers sleep with us). While they work well, even after washing they are a bit stiff. I suppose that is necessary if they're going to really protect the mattress - and most people would put them under the fitted sheet.I would recommend them to anyone who needs to protect their mattress, couch, chair, etc from liquids of any kind."
5,The personal memoir of one woman's experience with menopause,"Thank You: Your Opinion Means Nothing To Me is the personal memoir of one woman's experience with menopause. Retelling physical, emotional, and spiritual stresses and trials with a twist of humor and the candor that comes from enduring sustained tribulation, Thank You: Your Opinion Means Nothing To Me is a sober and insightful reflection upon what it truly means to grow old, accept oneself, and find one's voice. From adjusting to her elderly mother moving back in, to the miffed realization that her sex drive is in neutral, to exploring revelations of mortality in flesh and spirit step by step, Thank You: Your Opinion Means Nothing To Me involves the reader by virtue of its very nonchalance in addressing everyday concerns as well as larger than life issues."
3,Thank you. Your Opinion means nothing to me.,"So far the best part about this book is its title, I've only read about half because it just hasn't ""grabbed"" me yet. The author is a little too hippie-ish for my taste. Some of her experiences with menopause are interesting, the recipes sound delicious - all in all, I am glad I purchased it used for a very good seller an Amazon."
5,A compendium of six romantic stories.,"Each story is centered around the change of the millennium. Each author takes a different approach to the theme, and the result is an intriguing variety of looks at the possibilities. All six are highly engaging, enjoyable reads. We're now well past the start of the millenium, whether you believe that event happened in 2000 or 2001, but that didn't dim my enjoyment of these stories in the slightest. The group as a whole is so strong, they can be read at any time and still be as charming and delightful as if you'd read them on New Year's Eve.----Karen McCullogh, Scribesworld Reviews"
5,Tom Sachs is All Things to All Men,"A brilliant look into a staggeringly creative vision, Nutsy's is represented well in this book. Tom Sachs will one day save humanity, if he has not already."
1,What a load of garbage.,"I bought this as it was a recommended companion to Tim Hawkinson's book... The Tim Hawkinson book is amazing - the Tom Sachs book is absolute crap. The ""art"" looks like something drunken college kids would set up in a dorm somewhere. Not impressed."
5,One of the best soothing dark albums ever,"The sonorous cello tones that rhythmically ride through this album make it one of my favorite albums ever, and a favorite of many I have shared it with. It is not a typical taste. It is dark and, literally the feeling tones of a dark wood instrument come to life. It is the feeling of moving through a beautiful night in a dark forest. A music to match a heavy heart and lift it up into something more sublime and optimistic. Highest recommendation if you like rich slow music that is never boring."
2,NOT USA MADE AS ADVERTISED,"I am not writing a review for the performance of this wok, but do want to make it clear that the wok I received is indeed NOT USA MADE, as advertised on the listing. In fact, upon examination of the wok upon receiving it, I found a stick on the bottom that says ""MADE IN TAIWAN, IMPORT: NEW STAR INTERNATIONAL"". If you are looking for American made products and are looking to purchase this wok based on this, then look elsewhere. I'm not sure if the sellers are intentionally falsely advertising their products but when I pay for something that says USA made, I intend to get something as such. I'm extremely disappointed in this purchase and will be taking further actions with Amazon to see if something can be done about this."
3,Nice but small!,"The sides of this stainless steel wok were not very tall at all, so for a 12 inch wok, you can really only manage to make a meal for one to two persons. I have family coming over all of the time, so this was a disappointment. For the size it is, after you spend the time seasoning it, which is not uncomplicated, it did cook well. For the money, a great little wok for a tiny kitchen."
3,"inexpensive, works. some caveats","I got this wok along with the bamboo wok cleaner (which I can recommend)Seasoned as per instructions... after using it a few times, about half the seasoning has come off. I have been careful not to scratch it.It is also not as hot as I had expected. My nonstick pans get much hotter than this on gas (it not good for them, but they do)"
3,Not very good...,"I hate singers who are singing these songs that doesn't have own rhytm and stuff! If I would be singer I would do absolutely new music, not these dance songs that's been already heard. Christina doesn't even have very good voice and this song was... Fine but not as good as ""Genie in a Bottle"" or ""I Turn to You""."
5,"""da genova"" by De André - a collection of songs by a great master","I purchased the disk ""da genova"" by Fabrizio De André a couple of months ago.It is a great one. This is a mix of songs that appeared in previous disks of De Andre.Some great songs that I like in the disk: ""La Guerra Di Piero"" (The war of Piero),""Suzanne"" (a translation of the original by Leonard Cohen),""La Ballata del Miché"" (The Ballad of Miche), and more (there are 14 tracks).The voice of De André is clear and pleasant, and the lyrics (in Italian) are genuine poetry.You will just fall in love with his work."
3,"Good for the money, but...","Has a very light fragrance, OK at first but makes me miss the pungency of Drakkar-like colognes. Also, doesn't really announce itself or stay with you thru the day. Thought I'd try it for the low cost, but..."
5,The BEST BEST roaster,"We have used this type of roaster for over 20 years. Our original which belonged to my mother in law was lightly chipped inside so after a little over 40 years of contiued use in two families we decided to get a new one.This pan guarantees the best turkey, roast, etc. No basting no worry.Don't waste your money on fancy designer roasters, they cannot compare."
5,I will never go astray again!!!,"I owned one of these years ago and got rid of it due to space constraints. What a mistake, my birds have been nothing but a total disaster ever since!!! The same end result -under cooked thighs and drums. These pans take all the guess work out. I always had excellent results but I just chalked it up to my own cooking expertise ( yeh, right!). I figured a more universal=($$$)roaster would be better & more practical, not the case. I'm so happy to have it back and so glad that such a great product, at an excellent price is from the good old US of A!!!P.S. - an 18 1/5 lb. turkey fits like a glove in the 19 in. roaster!"
1,Not the product I ordered,When I ordered this roaster the description said the handles were on the side of the lid and the picture showed the handles on the side of the lid. I discovered the roaster I received had the handle in the top of the lid. Now I can't use the top as a second pan as hoped. Amazon disappointed me this time
2,Inces,"When I am looking for a 19inch pan, is because my turkey was that big, why in carnation would your measurement be from handle to handle??My turkey did not fit!Grr!!!measurements should be the used part of the pan, No??Your measurements are useless!!"
5,Great Roasting Pan,"I received this in a reasonable amount of time (only paid for the cheapest shipping) and have used it several times now. I feel it's well made and the lid fits nicely. I had one similar to this that was so old that a hole rusted in the bottom (used it to go sledding in when I was a kid, lol!) and wanted to replace it. This one is a bit bigger than the one I had, but the next smaller size sounded like it was going to be smaller than my old one so I picked this one. I am going to order another one in a smaller size too as this one is larger than I would normally require, but will be great for Thanksgiving."
1,Damaged,One of the handles was warped. The enamel was chipped and the metal under it rusted. I ended up with a nasty enamel splinter in my finger. I also did not have a pan to roast my turkey in. :(
5,great for my turkey,This is great and very large. It hold a 20 lb + Turkey. It was very easy to clean. Also youcsn not beat the great price here.
5,good for industrial operations,"We use this size Borum & Pease record book for our control room logs. It's big enough to stay open when sitting on a desk. The pages are the right size for extended description log entries. Quality is very good, as we have used them for years and they don't fall apart."
1,Don't waste your money,"Short and simple end of it, the dvd is super cheesy an inaccurate. You will be sorely dissapointed if you purchase any of the series. I actually own the whole thing and have only watched one and a half episodes with my son. I couldn't watch it anymore."
3,Is it a joke?,"Some things about this video are well done. It's interesting enough. But the whole time, you're wondering if the producers were out to undermine biblical faith. Adam, in particular, looks and talks and acts like a complete goofball. It's bizarre how goofy he is, and impossible to believe that the producers didn't spend a lot of time laughing at what they made. I gave it three stars because we borrowed it from the library; it would be even less if we had purchased it."
5,Excellent book,"This is an excellent book, but this, as well as others on reed organs, do notinclude enough information on the simple little MELODEON."
2,A very poor audio quality cd.,This CD was apparently made from a damaged analog source. There is a lot of distortion present in the lower frequency's that greatly detracts from this fine musical performance by Jose Larralde.
5,Sarah Spenser had a perfect life --,"a life that revolved around the future she planned to build with her fiance, Justin Tolbert. But when she leaves home, returns with a baby and sends her fiance a ""Dear Justin,"" letter, that life she envisioned is forever changed. Four years later, Justin is the new Earl of Wynfield, a title that carries more debt than anything else. And Lady Sarah has an offer -- marry her, provide a role model for her four year old, Drew, and she'll pay off the estate's debt. Their marriage could put an end to their problems, but can it be the beginning of something rare and wonderful as well?LSS is a definite skip-to-the-top-of-the-TBR-pile read. Sarah and Justin's rediscovery of a love that never truly died, and their love for one small boy is a heartwarming read that won't let go of you for some time to come!"
5,GREAT EMOTIONAL ROMANCE!,"Gayle Wilson has done it again -- great story!Loved the emotional and mental growth of Lady Sarah in the four years that she takes sole care of her ""child"" not to mention her father.Justin Tolbert, the new Earl of Wynfield, has nothing but debts and a wounded body to offer anyone. His greatest fear, would Lady Sarah be tolerant of his being less of a man? It takes the child, Andrew to soften up Justin's emotions that he can tolerate a marriage of convenience. But the worst fear happens as he realizes he has not lost his love for Sarah over the past four years.The threat from the natural father of Andrew really ties up the story -- and what a way to end -- couldn't help but grin.Cant't help it -------- but dahh! N.Y, something tells me that you have no understanding of the emotions or morality of the regency period. They didn't think like the general public of this day and age.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- a story that should be enjoyed by all."
2,"wonderful hero, horrible heroine","My God,I suffered with the hero in the book, she is just so mean to him.I know she thinks she has a good reason, but is a death bed promise a good reason to repeatedly hurt the man you apparently love?I just could not feel any of the love, she is just not at all open and honest with him through most of the book, and hurts him terribly with this, and I did not feel a real justification for it.He is great but I would not recommend the book."
1,1080i instead of 1080p,"this film on blu ray was mastered in 1080i resolution instead of 1080p resolution INTENTIONALLY. it was done to compensate for the framerate of this film and had it been mastered in 1080p it wouldn't have been compatible with north american television's frame-rate capabilities! amazon, PLEASE BRING THIS ITEM BACK! the one star review is just to get this review noticed so more people speak up, and it in no way reflects my opinion of the title itself***EDIT 10/21/11***hey! someone listened! amazon brought the item back!"
2,Good light but large and HEAVY!,"Sadly, I'm sending mine back.I was very hopeful. The concept looked solid, and the placement (on the handle in the center) seemed optimal.I'm not returning it because it failed, or because it didn't provide enough light, but because the first time I clamped it onto my Char-Broil grill handle, and opened the cover with it was attached, the lid would not stay up unless I held it open. For lawds sake, it has 4x D batteries in it, and has to weigh about 3-4 pounds!Sorry Brookstone, I'm a fan of most of your products and innovations, but I think that since you are using LED lights, it would be better to run it off of AA batteries (solar charger maybe for the next generation?) that need to be changed more often, (maybe this is the Alaska version?) rather than designing it around D cells that make it heavier than the boom box I owned 20 years ago in High School.Still looking for a good (non-gooseneck) BBQ light..."
1,Not waterproof,"I used this once. Next time I tried to use it, I found it was waterlogged. Doesn't work anymore even after drying out for a few days. Brookstone did not state that it could not be left outside. Big rip-off, especially for this price."
1,Anything but weatherproof!,"Brookstone advertizes this product as being weatherproof, great for year 'round grilling, and states that 'it's okay to get it wet'. I didn't have mine for more than a few months when I noticed water had leaked into the lamp area (even though it was kept completely covered for all but a couple of rain showers). It stopped working shortly after, even though I brought it in doors to allow it to dry out. It was a gift from my wife, who inadvertently threw out the receipt; but still had the bank statement showing date and location of purchase. Brookstone refused to replace the product. This is an expensive item, and for a company not to recognize when it is defective and replace it in good faith (especially when branded with their own brand) is inexcuable. I will never purchase another Brookstone product again!"
5,The Truth about Communism,This book gives previously classified material about the communist infiltration of our government and nation. It proves that the Rosenbergs were spies and got what they deserved. A heavy but great read.
4,Excellent book,"This is an important piece of the History Puzzle that is ""Communism in the USA."" The story of these documents, their creation, and the revelation of many facts about communist activities is crucial because their secret status for so many decades made it possible for leftists to shout accusations about government paranoia. Now, it is clear. There was no paranoia."
3,Decoding Soviet Espionage in America,"I guess that I was hoping for a little more excitement in this account ofSoviet spying in the West. A lot of facts and names, some good information but presentation style is very dry and does not hold the attention of the reader for very long."
5,Superior service,Perfect Amazon sale!Book received in perfect condition in minimum shipping time.D.Cathcart
2,Works wells but only lasted 4 hours,This item works well. However after 4 hours it quit. I think the mike is broken. They tell me I will have to ship it back to them on my dime.For the price I paid for the item I am disappointed.
3,Surviving Walk to Survival,"To understand and appreciate Walk to Survival, you need to reflect back on your life as an early teenager, the target audience of the book. I read the book back in 1974 when I was 14 and was deeply moved by it. I re-read it several months ago (Jan. 2000) and was impressed how ""out of touch"" I had become to my own 14 year old son. The book follows the bitter two day journey of 14 year old Palmer, his older sister Jackie and younger twins, Jonah and Jan, who have survived a plane crash in the Colorado Mountains in which their parents both die. Paralleling this journey is the path Palmer makes in his own mind, coming to grips with his self-doubt and budding manhood as well as his relationship with his siblings and parents. The book wonderfully conveys the emotions, the insecurity and confusion that we all have gone through as teenagers but which we may have forgotten."
1,Piece of junk - to quote my niece,Not worth the money... It hardly worked at all and we ended up throwing it away less than a week after Christmas.
4,REPLACE THE BATTERY IMMEDIATELY...great fun!,This was fantastic after we replaced the cheap Chinese battery it came with. And the bubble solution that comes with it is the best we've found anywhere.
1,DOA - Do not buy.,This toy arrived in a box and was not functional at all. Spend some more and buy a better product so you don't disappoint your kid(s). My son was looking forward to his bubble gun and I felt bad that he could not play with it when it did arrive.
1,Toy stopped working after 1 use,We put the batteries in and let the bubble battle begin. The next day only one of the 3 I purchased was working. Poor quality.
4,A bit hard to get going at first .. but worth it,"For some reason, this thing is picky and can be hard to get going at first. But once you get it going, it's great .. streams of bubbles, lots of fun.A bit hard for a 3 year old to operate by herself."
1,Cheap chinese piece of junk,"1) It came in half-open box. Not shipping box, box of the item itself. Looks like somebody tried to pry it open. Probably was in some corner of the warehouse and somebody found it :)2) Didn't work well since start. Took couple of tries to get a single bubble. Once it would start it worked fine though, but it is more temperamental than my lovely lady, and that is something.3) Finally broke today. Took it to electrician to take a look at it. Looks like it is assembled by a half-blind Chinese monk who never saw something like this in his whole life.Don't waste your money. Buy something better...if you can find it."
5,Motorola V series Marlin Blue Phone Wrap,"It was a brite, beautiful blue to easily cover your Motorola V series with! Great buy! I recommend it to anyone who wants their cell phone to be well covered!"
3,GOLF GLOVES,VERY COMFORTABLE; NOTE PURCHASE LABEL IS FOR HAND GLOVE IS WORN NOT ORIENTATION OF CLUBS.
4,Good Glove,"It's a great value glove, obviously it's not going to be the best glove you'll ever own but for the price it's a very good practice glove or even playing glove for a casual golfer. Make sure you select the ""right"" hand. I don't know if they cleared up that problem yet, read other peoples most recent reviews for help."
4,Happy with it,"It's as good for me if not better than most of the $12 gloves I've bought.It does seem a bit more snug than most XLs, so I believe the reviews who said they have size problems.On the other hand (no pun intended) I don't believe that this glove is not durable. I've been using mine for at least 10 rounds and it's still in perfect working shape."
2,Tore right away.,"After playing three holes with this glove the seams in the webbing of the fingers came apart. The glove can still be used, and works well, but is low quality. You get what you pay for."
2,Poor quality,I found this glove to be of poorer quality then what I have been accustomed to getting for similar price in golf specialty stores. The leather seemed thinner and sewing poor. Glove started to come apart after only a few rounds. Would not recommend
4,feel good,"feel good, it is something you can use in the course.just fine. Ya, it is fine and good enough for golfer."
5,great golves,This intech design carbetta golves are the most best golves for the price and they are so comfortable!They are great in all conditionsLasts very long for about 2 years if looked after properly
3,sizing relativity,"The material thickness of this glove is fairly thin, giving impression that its life is limited with normal use. More to the point is the size. Fitting tightly, it seems to be suited for SMALL male hand. Not at all a LARGE as advertised. Then I think that it would be better to have a little elasticity in the areas which will be in stress during use."
3,"Lacks ""feel""","Although this glove seems to be durable and has a fair price, it lacks the ""feel"" that higher quality and more expensive gloves offer. But I don't think higher handicap and week-end golfers would notice the difference."
5,good quality,"been an amateur, I can't tell the difference between this and the $20 branded glove. Fit nicely and feels good."
1,poorly constructed,"On my first round out, the glove ripped at the wrist as I was putting it on. Of course, that was 32 days after I bought it so no refund for me. The leather was nice and it fit well, it just seemed to be a design flaw. I guess this is to be expected of a $7 glove."
2,Poor Stitching,"I noticed the stitching on the inside of the glove was uncomfortable and played 2-3 rounds with this glove before it became a glove I use on the driving range only. The low-cost is nice, but truthfully, I am more impressed with the generic gloves sold at Roger Dunn Golf similarly priced."
2,didnt last long,"Got this glove and maybe by my 10th round already have a hole in it. My last one lasted years. Wouldnt buy it again, spend a little more and you will be saving money in the long term"
5,Love it,Very nice fit and nice and soft Cabrera leather. Would order and buy again. Very good value for the price
3,Okay Glove,After only the second time that I used the gloves they were already ripping. But it is still holding up after awhile
3,cheap glove,"Be sure to read the other reviews and order this product the way suggested. It is a small fit - I have big hands and normally take an XL, but this glove is smallish and hence not as comfortable as other gloves. The old saying is true, ""you get what you pay for""."
3,not great,This is an OK glove. I have used it for about 10 rounds now and its getting stiff and showing some wear. So its not too durable
1,Might be my last Amazon order!,"I placed my order 2-4-07, and on 3-8-07, I'am still waiting for the order to be shipped. I have not received a e-mail stating why, or heard anything from anyone. The order was supposed to be shipped 2-23-07.Very UpsetWayne"
2,UPDATE AND APOLOGY TO INTECH,Not a good choice. Ordered my usual x-lrg and glove was small. Later ordered an xx-lrg and was exact same size as x-lrg. Go to WalMart and get their house-brand synthetic glove for a little less in price but far superior in value and correct sizing.Wish to amend this review. Glove actually stretched to a perfect fit after a few wearings and is still going strong months later. Turns out it is actually a very good glove. The inexpensive price is just an added feature. My apologies to Intech.I plan to order more of these.
3,it pretty good,The glove actually looks kind of cheap to me. my boyfriend and his father golves an i got this as a birthday present for his dad i was kind of embarrassed when he opened it but i guess you get what u pay for. so i guess this is a good gift if it doesnt really matter about quality
2,Didn't last three weeks,"Been having a heck of a time finding an affordable glove for my right hand. I have soft hands, and really need gloves for both hands or I end up with blisters after 18 holes. Finally found this on amazon, 4 star rated for $6, figured I couldn't go wrong.The tip of the thumb ripped after about 6 rounds, and this is on my right hand- not the one that gets the most abuse. The (I assume) vinyl coating separated from the fabric, and I could see it was very thin and easily ripped. For comparison, the Nicklaus gloves I've been wearing on my left hand that I got for a comparable price in a 3 pack at C****o have lasted for months and I only replace them because eventually they get gross, but they don't wear out or tear. Have better feel than these also. If only they were sold for the right hand.Almost got the 12 pack. Glad I didn't."
5,great glove,This is a very good glove for the price! Fits nice and has good grip on the golf club! I would buy this glove again!
5,Great Golf Glove and Value,"This is a great golf glove for the money. It fits well and looks good. It's a nice, soft leather. It is comparable to gloves that cost $15-20."
3,OK but not great,"The palm of the In-Tech glove is made of a rather thick leather, thus reducing feel. Good for cooler weather, though."
3,Spend a little more for a good glove.,"If you got it to spare, spend a little more money on a better quality glove. Breathability is averaged. Already see worn damaged occurring in palm of glove after first use. I guess it would be worth it it you only golf a few times a year but if you play a lot, I would not recommend this golf glove."
1,Never received what I ordered,"I ordered the BOOK "" Fasting for a Spritual Breakthrough "" instead I get a study guide. I called Amazon back twice after that and was shipped the study guide two more times! It seems they can't get it right when shipping this book. If you are looking for the study guide - it seems interesting but it is hard to know when I have never read the book that goes with it!"
1,fasting for spiritual breakthrough,"I ordered three books. I got only two of them. I never got the ""spiritual breakthrough"" book. I don't know how to get the book. Let me know"
1,I do not recommend this book,"The ideas expressed in this book are troublesome and not supportive of a healthy and positive spirituality. Other, more balanced books are available."
5,Different types of fasts explained,Excellent. Provides detailed information and education on a variety of fasts and the purpose of each fast. Easy to understand and validated by scriptures.
2,flat,"I miss Jack Dejohnette. The trio seems to be back too far off the edge here, and I think tis is due at least partly to the lack-luster drumming of Paul Motian, who is filling in for the groups best drummer, Jack Dejohnette. This is ho-hum compared with the real trio."
2,HUGE!!!!,"This watch is EXTREMELY H-U-G-E !!!!!!! If ""bling"" is a word that you use on a daily basis, then you may love this watch. Otherwise, it may be the gaudiest thing you have ever seen. I got it for a guy who is 6'3"" and 300 lbs. It was ridiculously gigantic, even on him. It is a huge hunk of metal with (you can't see this in the photos) a bright yellow bubble-type cap on the center dial. Everyone who saw it just stared. I eventually bought him another watch, but I showed him this one before I returned it just for laughs.Another word of caution: I was able to return this without any problem because the band had a scratch. I don't know if that's a common thing with this brand, just something to mention.That being said, the blue watch face is beautiful and the gold plating was impressive."
4,Great costume,"I purchased this costume from a different website for Halloween last year. I am almost 5'5"" and 140 lbs and a fairly well endowed DD. I wore a garter underneath it so I wouldn't have to suck in my stomach all night. I also wore some little spandex volleyball shorts because the skirt is fairly short. The sizes do run a little small, I was glad I got the XL, anything else would have been too small."
3,The worlds most dangerous kult?,"Being a fan for 15 years, I thought I'd give this a rent. It wasn't bad to see once, but i'll probably never see this twice. I guess the videos weren't as good as I expected them to be. ""And This Is What The Devil Does"" was ok, as was ""Kooler Than Jesus"", ""Sex On Wheels"" and ""Blue Budda"", but most was a tad on the repetitive side, and rather boring. Lot's of stage shots, etc. You can get the drift of each video in just the first 30 seconds of the song. Songs like ""Glamour Is A Rocky Road"" have more potential. Also, why are there no vids for ""X-Communication"", ""A Daisy Chain For Satan"", or ""Cuz It's Hot""? The live stuff was decent, and the film short at the end was something anybody could have done. Still, something to see for the major fan. Otherwise just enjoy the kool music, and make your own videos in your head."
5,LOVE them,"These are awesome, stay flat and don't bunch up (via floor hooks) and easy to clean, not sure why I put up with carpet mats for so long for my e39 540i. No chance of jamming the accelerator like a toyota and doing 120mph into a concrete wall :-)"
4,Perfect fit for E39,"As mentioned before, this is a perfect fit for the E39.Includes new mounting brackets and instructions.After 3 months of usage, there are some dirt stains that won't come off. But overall they still look great."
4,BMW rubber mats,"Nice mats, good fit. Got these for my 525i to use during winter to keep water & dirt off my BMW carpet mats."
2,They don't honor their money back guarantee,"As a scientist I used to swear by these lab notebooks, until the last few started falling apart by the time I was through with them. When I tried to take the company up on their money back guarantee all I got was a deafening silence. Their quality (and customer service) is certainly not what it used to be."
5,Wax On Radio,"I have been following Wax on Radio for about a year. I have bought their first album along with the new EP. The bass lines are forceful, and the drumming is very creative with a new sound. The singers voice also carries with you for a long time afterwards. I would reccommend the album to anyone who likes music. ""Dawn Architects"" is one of the newest and best songs, only rivalled by ""General of Medicine City"". The triumph of the new EP is old favorites such as ""Give Me a Place to Stand and I will Move the Earth"" and ""Today I Became a Realist"". A defintite must have for any Chicago Indie-Rock scene fan."
4,Nice product!!,"Previously I owned a Nissan/Thermos Stainless steel 16 oz. backpack Vacuum bottle with a flip lid. The plastic bottom broke when I dropped it. I try to preserve things, yet as time persisted the plastic lid also fell apart and lost it's seal. Not much to really go wrong with this unit since it appears to be mostly stainless steel. I am a little weary of the interior non-stick coating though. Nevertheless I use this product every day and have been satisfied 100% so far. I'd recommend it!"
1,Teflon lining unecessary and possibly toxic,"Although this manufacturer has a reputation for vacuum bottles' retaining their temperatures for a long time, I returned this bottle when I realized the interior was completely lined with Teflon! Why?? Teflon is not a clean substance, and is a carcinogen at high temperatures. For sustained very hot temperatures, as in storing hot coffee, there is no advantage for the consumer. As far as cleaning, Teflon would stain more than a stainless steel interior, and would probably affect the taste of the coffee. Hopefully, this manufacturer's major mistake will be rectified."
2,Problem with internal coating,"I bought this thermos for my wife to take her coffee to work. Unfortunately, she said the coffee picked up an unpleasant taste from the coating on the inside of the thermos."
3,So-so,"This product is good but not excellent. The reason is that it's Teflon lined which is not heathly for you. Also, it's doesn't keep liquids hot as I was used to when using my other bottle (it broke). It's not bad and it's certainly better than Sigg bottles for instance but I like my liquids to stay hot; not warm. It helps though to put hot, boiling water in the bottle before putting coffee in it but who has time for that."
4,one of the best,I had this for 1 and 1/2 years...it's so great! Since I lost it last week I will get another one just like this again. Work with cold as well as hot coffee... I use this product every day and have been satisfied 100%. but remember don't put anything sweet! neither milk in. I'll recommend it!
2,not the best thermos,"this thermos initially kept my coffee hot for hours but after bringing it to work on my bike a few times (i assume, no visible damage was done) it's lost that ability. the outside of the thermos is now quite hot after filling it with coffee & consequently heat loss is rapid.additionally, the cap has a lot of space where water can hide so after i wash it it doesn't dry all the way and eventually that leads to a mildew sent. if you live in a dry climate it probably won't be an issue, but it was for me.spend your money on something else."
4,A Duck Hunters Best Friend,"Anyone that has sat in a cold January duck blind for several hours knows the value of a good thermos bottle. After trying everything on the market from the big, honkin' gallon size to the teeny weeny designer bottles, the Zuji is by far the best I've ever used. As long as you 'season' the bottle for a few minutes with very hot water, you will have hot coffee 'til the last drop. Pours easy, but make sure you have stopped pouring before you pop the button closed or you will end up with a little hand shower of scalding brown liquid. After two seasons of hunting 30-40 days a year, I did have to read the instructions and disassemble the top and give the rubber stopper a good thorough cleaning, as it has started to drip. Aside from that, I've ordered a backup and my only complaint is that it doesn't come in camo!"
1,"Crap game, even for its time",One of the worst games I have ever played (and I am 49!). Graphics are a joke. The game freezes up and kicks you out. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
2,Uncompatible,"I bought it for my S460, as it clearly says for S Series Notebooks, never mentioned for the Old versions of the S Series Notebook. It's voltage output is 16 V which is not compatible with my ""more advanced"" S 460, that needs input of 19.5 voltage. So the replicator works with all periferals, except the power supply. My notebook doesn't get enough Power so it shifts to battery usage and doesn't get enough electricy to charge the battery after its consumption."
1,NCV audio review,"While this CD set is in a very nice carrying case with a magnetic clasp, and the sound is clear, unfortunately the background music (with an ocassion drum beat etc) is distracting, and, and for me personally, the person narrating it has a 'southern preacher' sound that I don't care for. If you prefer a southern preacher reading this and background music then you will really enjoy this. I'm used to Alexander Scourby with no music/dramatization, so this was a let down for me."
5,Simply Amazing,"Jarrett's _Standards in Norway_ quite frankly blew my head off. It was one the first jazz albums that I owned, and in this sense was a realy introduction to modern jazz for me. The trio's sound is so textured; the listener feels as though he's actually sitting in the concert hall. Jarrett plays with a kind of frantic yet tempered emotion, the notes crescendoing up and down the keys.What a wonderful album. I listen to it almost every day."
5,Invicta Ocean Ghost II Chrono 2635,"This is one large watch; however, it sits comfortable on the wrist! The three mother of pearl chrono dials are outstanding! You will catch yourself looking at this watch constantly!"
1,Cheap quality,"We purchased this watch two times. The first time the watch leaked, fogged up, and stopped working. So much for being a dive watch. It couldn't even pass a short dunk in the sink. Amazon was great about the return. We then ordered the same watch again. The second watch was also broken. The knobs on the side would turn. We will not be buying another Invicta watch."
3,This is a kids book,"I bought this book thinking it was an in-depth look at the band and the stories behind the break-up...but it is more of a superficial collection of info. It was definitely interesting, but be aware that the book is aimed at children, and won't really give you massive insight into the guys. :)"
2,For the kindergarten set,"When other reviewers called this a ""children's book,"" I imagined a chapter book for an elementary school student. So I shrugged and bought it anyway, figuring that's better than nothing (if there's another book about Savage Garden out there, I'd love to know!).This is not for elementary school. This is for kindergarten. Short paragraphs, simple vocabulary, arranged in verse format like Dr. Seuss. Sample paragraph: ""Daniel is blond. He is shy.""And since the inside is all black and white, it doesn't even make that good a picture book."
4,For the occasional user,"I have had this fax machine for two years now and it has performed flawlessly. Admittedly, it is not a high volume machine but for the person who only sends or receives an occasional fax, this little machine is ideal. I am impressed with Sharp's ability to publish a completely understandable instruction booklet. It is well written and features pictures to guide one if a problem surfaces. Additionally, the display window sends messages and prompts to help operate the machine. Even the imaging film hasn't been a problem. After two years, the first roll finally ran out and was easily reordered and installed. All in all, a very good purchase and I have been very satisfied."
5,My experience with Amazon,"I am very pleased with the fast delivery. The price I paid was unbeleivable, and I am very satified with my Sharp Fax Machine. Thank you Janet Haralson"
1,This fax/copier stinks!!!,"The people who wrote the positive reviews for this must work for Sharp. I trusted the reviews and ordered a machine. What a mistake! I've had it for only a month. I was able to make less than 20 copies on the machine before the ink roll ran out. The ink roll is a sheet of what is like the old fashioned mimmeograph sheets our teachers used to make copies, loosely rolled on a cheap plastic cylinder. It's hard to load and feels like it could easily rip. I would never recommend this machine to anyone!!!"
1,"It is a terrible experience,","I bought a Sharp UXP115 Fax Machine, and it is a cheap and bad fax machine. I dont think to buy again, the bond paper is expensive and it is very complicated to remove and put it on the carbon paper inside the fax....I have broken simple plastic pieces in the change of reposition carbon paper...very fragil....and it do not support more than 5 paper sheet in the paper tray....it is the worst fax in the world."
1,This fax machine stinks,"I hate this machine, it worked for maybe a year and then it started jamming every time I attempt to send or recieve a fax. Get a higher quality fax machine. This machine is garbage."
4,Easy to use and works great,"I needed a fax machine to send occasional outgoing fax documents. This machine works great. It is simple to use. Just plug it into your phone jack, place your document in the feeder, enter the recipient number, and press start.I have no experience with incoming fax on this machine. If I were to receive a lot of incoming fax, I would prefer a plain paper machine that uses toner (rather than imaging film as this one does).Overall, for the price, this is a good machine for limited usage."
1,lousy product,"Our surge protector died one month and one week after we purchased it--one week over the time given to return it. Now we have to buy a new one after already wasting money on this one. Thanks for nothing. Best Buy, here I come."
2,6 outlet version,"There is a 6 outlet version that looks like this one, but the 6th outlet is on the other side. Do not bother with the 6 outlet one unless you have very narrow width plugs (or only about 4 you need to plug in). For example two typical three-prong plugs will not fit side-by-side. The unit itself has a narrow width three prong plug and it appears that is the standard they used for the spacing.The concept of these smaller UPS units is nice for all the ""little"", but critical, gear like routers and ink jet printers. APC usually makes good UPSes, in my experience. However, the 6 outlet version needs to be returned to the drawing board and the engineer given some real world plugs to design by."
2,click click click,My APC unit went bad after the first power loss. Battery back up plugs became useless and the unit began making clicking noises at times. It still serves as a surge protector (I think) but battery function can't be used and noise from the unit is annoying. I'd look at other brands.
2,"Not Durable, Click, Click, Click","We have the 6 outlet version and have used it for two or three years. It has always been temperamental during and after power failures, and recently let go after one. Now it just goes click, click, click. I certainly wouldn't recommend it."
2,Unimpressive quality,"The unit I bought failed just out of warranty. Unimpressive reliability for something with no moving parts. Also the two outlets for battery backup are not far enough apart to accommodate any two plugs. The unit did work for the occasional power outage, but for the price I'm looking for higher quality this time around."
2,Oooooh Nooooooo!!!!!!!,Another diva with an enchanting voice fallen down the electronica abyss. Has anyone heard of Electribe 101?? The music was as lush as her voice. What happened?
2,it's billie but...........,"I bought this CD and was waiting for ages for it to show up, then when it did finally arrive, I excitedly put it in the stereo and cranked it up, only to hear rather bland, run of the mill, dated drum and bass with BRM singing over the top. Not very thrilling or original and even Billie's gorgeous vocals don't do much to redeem this effort, the only song worth noting is the last track, ""Pacemaker"" with more sparse beats and clever lyrics and vocal stylings. The rest of the EP sounds like a demo, and in fact could be as I have since read on the official BRM website that Billie does not endorse this product and has re-recorded some songs on her latest album, ""18 carat garbage"". It was the old record company that issued this EP. Anyone who wants more BRM should go to her official website which is billieraymartin.com, there's some great stuff there, check it out."
2,This game is bad,"This was the first and, at the time, hardest game I have ever played on a system as a 6 year old. 14 years later, I pick it up again with all the rage I carried with me to that day, I beat it.4 lives total, no continues, no saves, nothing. You either beat it all in one go or you start all over. So I stuck around the house for half a day and you know what happened? A 16-bit CONGRATULATIONS and I got to start all over again.The game is nice to look at and the music is catchy. You get to stomp on woodland creatures and they suddenly bolt past you off the screen. Pass by flowers and they bloom, jump on baskets to collect extra points, again, all this for no reason. Points don't matter, they're not saved, it doesn't add up to anything. It's also very easy to die.Whomever made this game probably did it as a joke."
4,I feel like I have a treasure.,"Although the book was somewhat worn, it holds together well - physically as a book, metaphorically as a collection of thoughtful and insightful words."
5,On Woming turning 70,Interesting book. Very motivating and inspirational. It made reaching 70 not so bad of a transition. It is nice to know that at 70 you can still be productive.
2,Didn't fit well and leaked,"I returned this for a refund because it leaked, no matter how tight or loose it was fit. Depending on size and shape of face, it may work fine for the right person, but not for me."
2,Not really a biography,"Instead of being a biography, this book is really an annotated list of Jane Austen's letters. While this prevents the author from a common sin of biographers, that of describing the era to the detriment of the subject, it also precludes her developing Austen more fully. Why Austen is regarded as the foremost female novelist in the English language, for example, is not addressed. The author also does not prove her thesis that Austen lived a double life.The author has an irritating habit of not giving years, particularly for important events such as Austen's death. C or C minus."
5,Helpful,Have two children late teens with ADHD and learning to help them and this bookcame well recommended. Easy to understand
3,"Cute design, cheap fabric.",I am happy with the colors and designs of this set but the material is not very soft/plush and it has an overall cheap feel to it. I would not order this set again if I had a choice.
3,A little less than expected,"I didn't want to spend too much on a crib set and still wanted it to be cute. This crib set is almost satisfactory, but I think for the money spent they could have used better materials for the sheets. More pictures of the product would have been helpful also - because the sheets and bumper are plain, no monkey pattern."
5,I depend on Amazon for books that aren't in the stores anymore,I had read the first book and wanted to complete the stories of the three sister's. Enjoyed them all.Anybody that likes romance would enjoy this book.
3,Not a slow cooker!,"This may be fine for reheating food as long as you monitor it closely. It cooks way too hot to be called a slow cooker. I used it on the lowest setting still quickly resulted in a charred mess and discolored lid. I contacted Coleman and they said the high heat is to be expected and that I should ""stir it every now and then."" If I want something to reheat food while constantly monitoring, I'll just use a pot on the camp stove."
3,Didn't use it,Purchased for a Christmas gift and returned it because someone else also bought one for the person I purchased it for
2,Not a slow cooker,"This was advertised as a slow cooker but it is more like a roaster. A slow cooker heats from the sides and cooks slowly, this cooker heats from the bottom and burned even on the low setting. I can still use it to cook some things but it is not a slow cooker."
2,Sits on a shelf,Cooker is made of too thin of a material for direct heat. Everything I have tried to cook in it burns or stick in the center unless stirred constantlym even on low heat.
2,Too hot!,It was too hot and everything either burned or stuck to the bottom. I would return it but it cost too much to do that.
3,"Not a slow cooker, but a fast reheater!","This ""slow cooker"" heats up very fast. I wouldn't put food in it and walk away. That said, if you cook your stew, soup, chili, etc. ahead of time, you can heat it up really fast in this portable cooker. No muss, no fuss."
5,Coleman Heat N Serve,The shipper totally ROCK!! He was very kind ship the same day and was here in 3 days arrive as we were leaving for vacation!! We love this product and was worht the price!
3,Not for fountain pens,"This rating reflects the quality of paper in the Boorum & Pease. Just a warning to other foutain pen users. The paper feathers horribly and bleeds through easily even with Japanese fine nibs that are on the dry side. The paper is also toothy and I would not be pleased with the quality even for a ball point pen.Three stars because the binding is good quality and the organization was done well with contents pages and numbered pages. Two stars taken away because of the paper quality, which is, after all, the bulk of what you will buy and use."
3,This book is okay but,"This book is okay, but it has no index.This is a cardinal sin, especially for a reference book.The publisher should be ashamed. They know better.They're just trying to save a few bucks.Also, in the Command Prompt Commands section, instead of providing the commands which have been added with XP, over the ones available in Windows 2000, it gives the commonly-used commands which are already provided in their Windows 2000 Commands Pocket Reference book."
4,A document of a time that has long past,"Not exactly what I was expecting, I thought this book was an extensive history of the Haight. It's instead a very light read focusing on the music of the era. Lots of good pics and a fun (albeit short) read."
4,Barney did good,"Extremely well done. Not only did it bring back a flood of memories of names and places I hadn't thought about in years, but captured the feelings, both good and bad, of a very strange time, something every good history should do"
1,Yawn and great disapointment!,"...Great photos and much ado about music. In short, I lived in the Haight-Ashbury during those wonderful years. And this book reflects nothing of what life was really like. At all, to us that were not directly tied to a band. I partied at 710 Ashbury and other places. I had hopes this would address what street life was truly like back then. It does not."
1,Quite Disappointed,"I am quite pleased I ordered a used copy of this book, and would have been quite disappointed if I had paid the [money on the] price tag.. Nice photos and much ado about music. In short, I lived in the Haight-Ashbury during those wonderful years. And this book reflects nothing of what life was really like. At all, to us that were not directly tied to a band. I partied at ...Ashbury and other places. I had hopes this would address what street life was truly like back then. It does not."
1,Loud. Louder. Loudest,"Sounds like a 747 taking off, perpetually.Unacceptable for desktop use.Be warned, I bought through MacConnection and they charged a 15% restocking fee of about 100 bucks. When I complained the product description of ""Quiet"" was wrong, I was told I could seek service through Western Digital. No way was I going to get sucked into that trap either. There was no way I was keeping this thing so I paid the restock.The Lacie 2TB drive has horrible reviews too but I've never had problems."
2,Deafeningly LOUD !!,The MyBook - is very big - very bulky - and EXTREMELY LOUD - don't know about smaller versions of this drive but the 1TB is a beast - and a noisy one too. The silver version more or less matches the look of the Aluminum MacBook Pro. It also vibrates a lot. I have tried several different orientations - eventually I put it on rubber isolating blocks. The rubbery mounts that it has don't do much. When it is quiet it is fine - looks kind of cool - but way too big on my desk. I use it at work - every so often the fan comes on and it makes a huge amount of noise. People have asked me if it ois going to blow up. In a noisy office with noisy blocking headphone and music playing I can still hear it. What were they thinking. I don't hate this thing - I have no idea of how reliable it is. But I would never buy one for myself or have one in my home.
2,Never Again,"I've been using numerous Western Digital drives for the past 2 years and in fact I have 2 of these 1TB drives that I've been using for video editing on a Mac.My main gripes are:The drive seems to spin down in like 30 seconds after not being accessed. Normally this would not be (as much) of a problem for other types of use, but it's absolutely unacceptable for video editing.The cooling fans are super-loud and seem to blow super-hard at odd times (not necessarily when they're working hard).I have to do all kinds of workarounds to get the drive to mount.I cannot chain more than 2 of these drives together and WD tells me I might have an issue with my computer motherboard which is BS.I'm not buying these drives anymore."
1,Well beyond noisy,"Some seem to have had good luck with this drive. Please count yourselves fortunate and leave it at that. I have never seen so many bad reviews for a product, and for good reason.I've had all of the problems mentioned by others with this drive, plus an intermittent high-pitched, shearing whine that smells of imminent drive failure. I've put in with WD for a replacement and am hoping to not have a repeat, but judging by the overwhelming numbers of people who've had trouble with this drive, I'm not feeling optimistic.Give this drive a 5-star review if you've had good luck, or if you work for Western Digital, but don't even begin to impugn the rest of us as whiners. You got your $400 worth.Steer clear of this drive."
5,EXPECTED SOME ISSUES..THERE WERE NONE,"I wanted the WD My Book II to back up years of pictures and DV. I read the reviews of just about every similar 1TB hard drive. Finally I selected the WD. The setup was simple, even the change from the Mac OS to Windows NTFS. The concern of the fan noise was non-existent. I've had the unit now for 3 days and everything is 100% perfect.. I'm satisfied."
1,disappointing,"I was very excited after I ordered and received the My Book Pro II. I set it up to use RAID mirroring. Unfortunately, within two months, one of the hard drives inside failed on me. I was hoping that Western Digital drives had become more reliable in the years since I last used them and wrote them off, but I have been disappointed on that front. I am going back to Seagate, as their drives have performed much more reliably for me."
4,Loud but I only use it for backing-up,"This drive has performed well so far and I have no complaints. The fan is loud as described by other comments, but since I only use it to back up my PowerBook and 4 other FireWire drives I only have to put-up with it once a month."
2,My Book Pro II External Hard Drive,"Disappointing, the drive is very noisy, when you reboot the drive runs with the fan on high then shuts down. I would not recommend this drive to anyone."
1,"bad hardware, bad software","1) The fan is very noisy,2) I had a *catastrophic* failure within few days of purchase,3) you need a driver to use this drive,4) I tried updating the firmware to 1.4 to deal with the noise - it failed every time I tried it."
2,Fan is so noisy its unusable,"I bought one of these drives recently and was *shocked* at how loud the internal fan is. Within 5 minutes of turing the drive on and copying over files the fan kicked in and it was like I had a leaf blower in the office. It's totally unusable. Maybe other people are fine with high levels of fan noise or put them in already loud areas, but put this thing in a quiet office and it's brutal. I'm returning it asap. I have no idea if this is a one-off situation or they're all like this. It doesn't seem to be defective and there is nothing in the software to reduce fan speed or lower the noise level. Just thought I'd post this as a warning to people who are looking at these drives. Buyer beware."
2,"Runs noisy, limited throughput in Windows XP","High data rates cause this drive to whine like a rusty gate and/or dismount with data loss under Windows XP. I have had four Western Digital My Book drives in the last two years, in sizes from 320 to 1TB, and all have been less than reliable, completely eroding my faith in WD."
2,Loud fan! Annoying high pitch drone,"Bought mine in January of 2007 for music storage. The loud fan and annoying high pitch drone makes it unsuitable for use in a hifi system. If noise isn't a problem, it works like a champ."
2,Not compatible with Camcorder,"First of all, fan noise not a problem for me. It has a loud mode for a few seconds, then its regular volume is fine.Second, it is (was) fast, and transferred files reasonably quickly. Raid1 set up was a breeze, would have given it five stars but....My whole reason for buying was to have a raid mirrored external drive was to download video from camcorder to the MyBook.Plug in a camcorder - The MyBook immediately disappears from the system. It can be brought back, but not easily.Now maybe I am a firewire newbie, but I thought the point of Firewire is that you could connect multiple devices. Apparently not. They can not even be connected at same time.THERE IS NOTHING ON WD's SITE (which I researched thoroughly before buying) THAT INDICATES THAT IT IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH CAMCORDERS OR ANY OTHER DEVICE.*****DO NOT BUY IF YOU PLAN TO CAPTURE VIDEO OR EVEN CONNECT A CAMCORDER TO YOUR SYSTEM****"
1,Run don't Walk away from this thing!!!!,"I have tried three of these MyBooks and each one has the same problem...file errors. The problem is it turns on and off by itself and if you leave it on and then decide to copy files over it will copy the files and then won't allow you access to them! It is a real piece of garbage. Western Digital should be sued over this useless, hack of an external hard drive. Don't trust your data to this because you will be sorry."
1,never worked,"I was excited to find this. On paper it looked like exactly what I had been looking for.The unit made all the loud ""launching"" sounds as described elsewhere, but would not communicate at all with my network. Documentation is next to nothing. Only comments in the documentation on the failure of the software to find the unit is ""check to see if power is on"" and ""check to see if network cable is attached"". This is supposed to be helpful? Phone support not available during the evening.After wasting several hours wrestling with this I gave up in frustration. Returned it."
2,NihLyle,"Died within 5 yrs. Second WD drive to do so. 4th WD drive from my work xp. WD have a 5 yr lifespan. That's 5 yrs of use. that's a planned 5 yr at max use. Though I've had 8 iPods with the same 5 yr lifespan. I suspect conspiracy. WD and Apple products have a 5 yr lifespan... of use. And I base that on over 8 computers and 6 ipods. I <3 Apple, but I think they are seeding destruction."
3,TOO LOUD FOR A HOME OFFICE,"I decided to ignore the negative reviews warning about the noise levels of this and when I found it on a great sale I picked one up. ""How loud can it be?"" I thought. Well, PRETTY LOUD - and unfortunately the sale was final.If truth be told, the Pro edition of these WESTERN DIGITAL external HardDrives is the best one: not only does it come with a triple interface (USB and two types of FW400 & FW800) but it also offers a RAID protection for one's data (halving its capacity though).I have a number of these and so far I had found them reliable and solid. Luckily I do not keep them constantly ON but use them as cold storage. I planned to keep everyday backups on this one but there is no way I could stand the fan noise on a daily basis.Good for corporate back up. Too loud for home applications."
4,WB 1TB Drive,Great drive just makes a lot of noise from the fan... You would think for the price that you pay for this drive that WD would have thought of making this quiter.Western Digital 1 TB My Book Pro II External Hard Drive with Triple Interface ( WDG2TP10000N )
4,rolodex 67620 laser/ink jet rotary file cards,the only problem i have with this is that the instructions are extremely unclear as to how to set it up in the address file on a computer. most labels tell you exactly which label format to use
5,Beautiful Photographic Review,"Braynard's history of the Normandie is an eloquent photographic argument that the Normandie was probably the most beautiful liner ever built. Although the historian or marine engineer would likely prefer more historical or technical narrative than is presented in this book, for the lay person and ship lover this collection of stunning photographs says it all. All phases of the ship's brief life are represented -- the boldness of her design and construction, the excitement of the maiden voyage, the glamor of her glory years of transatlantic and cruise service, the loneliness and decay of the early war years, and of course her horrible demise. Through these well-organized and high-quality photographs, the reader can immerse himself/herself in the bygone era of the great liners and experience something of this wonderful ship. Such a nostalgic trip is more than worth the low price of admission!"
5,Fascinating: the story of the language.,"I really enjoyed this.Traces the evolution of English, pinpointingthe first use of many words now ineveryday use.For instance, when did people start talking about'politicians'? Or 'originality'? Not so long agoas you might suppose.I'm buying another copy for a friend."
4,A Wolf's lovers must to read!,"Picked this book up soley because it concerned wolfs, and found it to be far more that a story about the Pack. The reader truly lives every moment with Helen, Luke, Buck, Eleanor etc. This book is a must for all who like the excitement of the outdoors and all the splendor and heartbreak it has to offer."
2,"Predictable, stereotypical, unchallenging","I LOVED the Horse Whisperer. However, this novel by the same author was no where near as good. The characters were shallow. The story dragged and was boringly predictable. The people were all very depressing. The book skimmed over the biogoical aspects of wolf restoration. It treated participants very stereotypically. I was very disappointed overall."
3,"Interesting plot, but controversial.","The depiction towards the beautiful scenery of Montana in the book was impressive, the plot was also intriguing, too bad some of the chapters seemed digressive and dull, but the last 10 were breathtaking. I don't know much about American ranchers, however, I found some of the characterizations were insulting and mostlikely to provoke controversies."
4,Another excellent book by the author,Nicholas Evans again uses the nature of wild animals as the metaphor for human relationships. Definitely recommend this book.
3,Entertaining Read,"This is a entertaining read from a good author. This book will be especially delightfull for individuals that have a love of nature and wolves. I am a true wolf admirer and will devour almost anything concerning these beautifull and misunderstood animals. I enjoyed how this book portrayed wolves as the intelligent animals that they are. The story was very well written and moved along at a nice pace, enabling you to stay focused and read on. Althought the players in the book are at the forefront of the book, in my opinion, the wolves overshadow them in this book. This is a noble work by a good author."
5,Excellent literature,"Not as intense as ""Horse Whisperer"" but still a very good book. I don't know a lot about the wolves and their habits, maybe the author was not very accurate here (as one of the readers suggested). But the beauty of the language of this book kept me flowing. That's what the Literature is all about, isn't it?"
1,Terrible,"This was typical ""New York is best and the rest of the world is full of country bumpkins"" stuff we see ad nauseum today. Why not a book about Montana ranchers setting alligators free in Manhatten ? New Yorkers are ""Tan and fit "" while people from Montana are inbred country ""Hicks"" who hate everything. Oddly enough, I wonder why the writer pushed smoking as so glamorous ?"
2,Love wolves but not the book,"As someone who enjoyed The Horse Whisperer (except for the ending which I disliked in both the book and the movie) I couldn't wait to read The Loop. Especially since it was about wolves -- a subject I have intensely studied for more than 15 years. I ended up very disappointed in all areas. The book failed to make me ""care"" about any of the characters like I did about the girl and her horse in The Horse Whisperer. And although I appreciate the author's research of the wolf reintroduction program, he may have set public perception of wolves back by decades. Wolves do occasionally kill livestock but this story portrays the killing of domestic animals(and sometimes not even eating them) as a regular event. Wolf lovers purchasing this book be warned!"
1,don't step into the loop,"Reading The Loop on our holiday, we (two girl friends) came very quickly to the conclusion that The Loop isn't wat we were expecting of it. It's a love story like 1000 before, no surprising plot, no character building. As the Horse Whisperer disappointed us, this book was even worse."
1,Dreary schlock,"I bought this for my daughter. She hated it. I read it (or most of it) afterwards. I am glad to see that my daughter has good taste. This book is awful, silly and sentimental and badly written. It goes to show what Robert Redford can do for a 'writer's' career - ie everything. Maybe he should move into publishing..."
3,Captivating but Insulting,"The book has a fantastic plot. The characters are interesting and the story line develops well. However, Mr. Evans would greatly benefit by more thoroughly researching his subjects before publishing a supposedly believable novel on the subject. Granted, most of his facts were accurate, from a rancher's perspective. I was impressed by some of the details he put in the book. However, there were some glaring faults in some of the details. I felt insulted that he just assumed that no one reading the book would know better. I found it hard to take the book seriously after encountering some of these faults. I think the book is a wonderful representation of some of the emotional idiocies in which humans tend to engage. I applaud Mr. Evans for his excellent writing skills but this applause is shadowed by contempt for not caring enough about his topic to research it correctly."
3,The Loop,T his was an OK story. I did not find it as satisfying or as well written as the other stories Nicolas Evans has authored.
5,"Incredible, relatable experience of a masterminding story.",This book brought tears but made up for with smiles. The perfect thought of life sets the scene of a town that falls apart. A natures' reality of instincts are expressed with vivid but breathtaking scenes.
3,"MISSING SOME ""LOOP""HOLES BUT YET, VIVID!","I was intrigued by the cover as any curious person would be. I read The Horse Whisperer and felt Evans had drawn out the character developments too far. It was slow going. When I started The Loop, I felt the same, waiting for the storyline to appear. As someone has said, wolves don't often stalk out family babies or dogs. So I found that a bit far fetched. Yet as movies are made dramatic to entertain, so too are novels for the sake of drama. Finally when Helen Ross arrived in Montana, I got to know everyone closer, more intimately. In the end, the introduction of wolves seemed to take a backseat to backcountry ""bigger gender organs."" Buck Calder could have easily been played by actor J.T. Walsh before his untimely death in 1998. Helen Ross could be acted by Suzy Amis or Annette O'Toole. But the reader of Evan's latest book will always remember the roundup of the plot...love conquers all and cowboys always get their girl. A good book in Montana or Florida."
2,He tries and fails,"The author tries to write a book about wolves yet hardly includes any content about them at all. He tries to create interesting characters but their development is so haphazard that it only serves to break the flow of the story. He tries to write a love story yet fails to make it compelling enough to draw the reader in. Don't buy this book if you're looking for something about wolves, they are the cause of the story yet rarely enter it. Don't buy this book for a love story unless you're into temporary happiness for the cynical and self-destructive. The only positive point I'll give the book is that I read the entire thing so there must be something there ... but why waste your time when you could read something of more literary value?"
3,Wolf behavior was inaccurate.,"Nicholas Evans lost complete credibility in the first pages of The Loop by his depiction of wolf behavior. A wolf would never entertain the idea of a confrontation with a human as Mr. Evans had the wolf in his opening pages do. Only a rabid wolf would have acted in the way this wolf did, and that was not an explanation given. This type of misinformation does a lot of harm as people who are not knowledgable about wolf behavior read it, believe it and fuel a misunderstanding of what a wolf is capable of doing. Mr. Evans made this same type of mistake in the latter portion of The Horse Whisperer when, contrary to the main character's ideals, the horse was totally tied and forced into submission. This would never have happened with a ""real"" horse whisperer. Mr. Evans is a potentially talented writer, but lazily reinvents facts or behaviors that are false and/or misleading. I won't purchase Mr. Evans' next book because of this major fault in his writing."
2,"Great setting, good pacing, but Evans fails to deliver","I enjoyed the Horse Whisperer because Evans made an effort to acquaint me with the main characters of the story: the mother and daughter, as well as the horse. I also got some feel for what life on a ranch might be like.The Loop felt like a poor reformulation. The characters seemed thinner -- almost caricatures. The wolves had almost no identity, and I learned almost nothing about ranching from the story.Too bad, because the story idea is a good one."
2,The Loop would make a so-so TV movie of the week.,"It's too bad that Nicolas Evans can't carry off an entire novel. The first couple of chapters always get your interest and you want to keep reading, but fairly soon the characters seem dull and the story doesn't develop. After the first few chapters I was able to scan through the rest of the book just so I could get it over with, and return it to the person that loaned it to me. We wern't able to have a discussion about the book because there was nothing to discuss. A waste of time."
4,Stop Analyzing and Just Enjoy!,"Hi there. As a college student taking advanced literature, I have to say, sometimes we just need to drop the deeper thinking and enjoy the story line. I've read both of Evans' novels and enjoyed them immensely! They have great story lines, lots of interesting facts, naughty interludes, and they provoke incredible emotions in the reader. Now sure, if you want to break it down the book isn't that glamorous. The characterization is weak, the story is somewhat predictable, but for an Englishman trying his first time at writing American fiction, I think he did a hell of a job, even if his research isn't perfect! This book is not for the analytical type unless you're like me and enjoy getting away from that sort of thing once in a while. However, if you're the average reader looking for a good story, I HIGHLY recommend The Loop as well as The Horse Whisperer! A++ on bringing the reader to the emotional level of the characters!"
5,Excellent character development with much intrigue,"Another of Evans' wonderful dramas with real human characters and the real trials and tribulations associated with life and living. The plot was exciting as was the storyline. There was never any question of understanding the feelings of the characters and beliving they were real. The story was a real page-turner, a book not to be put down until finished!!!"
2,Softies Only!,"I originally had good expectations for this book, it being critically acclaimed and all. But when I picked it up and began to read, it struck me that although the first few chapters were good, it rapidly became a tired good-guy, bad-guy issue. And, surprisingly, I actually found myself rooting for the bad guys! The two protagonists, Helen and Luke, were a couple of lovey-dovey softies, while the antagonists, Buck Calder and Joshua Lovelace, were intelligent and had real inner strength. I was disappionted at the ending, not only because the ""good guys"" won, but also because the ""bad guys"" were turned into softies like them too! Not a very enjoyable read.."
2,"Loved the first chapter, then I was bored","the book fit most of small town Montana, applies exactly where I live"
1,Spare Me,"If you want to read about wolves and the wolf recovery effort, read Barry Lopez or one of the other experts Evans credits. If you want to read about real evil and human/wildlife conflict with all of the complexities, heartbreak, and enigma this presents, read Cormac McCarthy. If you want to read something by a good writer who just wants to sell books, read this. Soap Opera. Very disappointing. Couldn't even finish it."
3,Kinda Female Appealling,"Evans' prose styling is not bad, but kinda too femanine. Therefore, for most female readers, it's a very good book. But it's too digressive and too out-of-the-loop again like what he did to his Horse Whisperer; horses became so vague and remote and romance and love-making became major issues. Wolves' howlings in this one, again, could only be heard in the far far away background."
2,The Loop,"This audiotape arrived damaged. The first two tapes had not been rewound AND could not be moved forward or backward! I had read part of the book, so it wasn't a huge problem I just read to catch up to where the tapes were playable. It was very inexpensive, so once again, it was not a big deal. When I finished, I tossed the tapes, since they were worthless."
1,Depressing people,"I read ""The Loop"" after the well-minded suggestion of a friend. It seemed to me that everybody in The Loop scenery is divorced or absolutely worried about their own egos. From the spiritual point of view, I found it depressing: no normal people and no valuable spiritual growing up to the end.""The selfish gene theory"" in the first chapters and the insistent description of Mr. Buck Calder as a sexual glutton were EVERYTHING I needed to have a nice reading ;-(Unfortunately we can not put a ""zero"" star in the score. If you really like people and wolves, I believe you'll not like this book."
4,"Not as good as Horse Whisperer, but nice to read","I loved the Horse Whisperer and they way that when you read it, you got ""that feeling"".. like you wanted to know the people, wanted to visit the places. The Loop is interesting, it tells a lot about wolves, but I wish we could have known the characters better. I wish it was 100 pages longer and that it told more about Helen and Luke. Nevertheless, it is NOT a waste of time it is still a beautiful book and yes, it still makes me want to visit Montana. I guess being a soft hearted girl, I wanted to know the wolves better, the characters better, the love story better and the killing of the wolves less (some is pretty brutal). I would recommend this book to anyone who likes wolves, wilderness stories,this author, or Montana. It's worth reading!"
4,"Descriptive, empathatic, keeps your attention!","The audio version reaaly takes you to Montana, the scene of much of the story. The descriptive way the author speaks about the surroundings as well as the wolves' features makes your mind wonder to exactly that place. Audio books that capture your spirit & imagination are a rarity-- great book!"
5,Nicholas Evans will not let you put his book down!,"This book had me attached from the get-go, once I started I couldn't put it down. Nicholas Evans does a great job of pulling the reader in, even if there is a rough spot of some information not relevant to the plot that you have to muddle through, you want to keep reading because the descriptions he gives are so compelling, and you know there is something completely exciting once you get there. There is always something to look forward to and I was wishing at the end that I could continue on reading about these characters that had so much to say and so much to offer. They were real troopers when the going got tough, on both sides of the wolf debate, but they were easy to relate to because at times you thought they would give up just like all of us want to. They all kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what each would do next and to see how much they had grown by the end of the book. It was like seeing real lives in action."
4,Slow going but definitely worth finishing!,"I didn't think I would like this book because it didn't pull me right away like his other novel, the Horse Whisperer. However I did finish it and am glad I did. I absolutely loved the characters, especially Helen. It turned out to be a funny, sad, exciting, and suspenseful read. The ending really surprised me. What a great book Mr. Evans, keep it up! I look forward to others."
4,Even better than The Horse Whisperer !,"Nicholas Evans has given his readers a great story about an interesting, controversial subject. His character developement is better and the story more believable than his first novel, The Horse Whisperer.It is thoroughly enjoyable. Anyone who loves animals, and has a love of nature will appreciate this book. I can't wait for the next one!"
2,Wonderful Story that went no where,I wanted to like this book but it drug on and on saying nothing. I could not wait until it ended to see if there was a end that would make it worth while. It was not there.
3,Wait for the paperback,"The Horse Whisperer blew me away. (The book, not the movie) The Loop was a nice story but I really expected more. As a devoted lover of wolves, I was entertained but not impressed or surprised. I never had the urge to flip ahead and read the ending. You know what is going to happen before it happens."
3,ENTERTAINING,"Mrs. Evans' second novel, ""The Loop"" was not in the same class as ""The Horse Whisperer"", but I still found the book entertaining. It certainly was not a waste of money. I recommend the book, but I believe that anyone who read ""The Horse Whisperer"" will have the same reaction as I did."
2,Yawn,"It is obvious Mr. Evans did most of the research for The Loop from his home in England. Cliche after cliche Mr. Evans leads us through a ""Spaghetti Western"" of a novel.None of his characters are allowed to grow or fully develop. The drama is as predictable as a ""Made for TV Movie."" Spend your money on something much more fulfilling, like an ice cream cone."
3,Not as good as Horse Wisperer,"The story was a little different, but not much. It pretty much mirrored The Horse Wisperer."
1,Lacking in depth,"This book is rather uninspired, with a weak story line. Very cliche. In one instance, Helen is awaiting a letter from her boyfriend in Africa, which conveniently arrives on the same day that someone decides to trample her mailbox and we are told how her letter floats away in the breeze - COME ON! I've seen better writing from high school students... I expected more from Nicholas Evans after the acclaim he received for The Horse Whisperer."
1,Author does NO research,"I was going to read this book but leafing through it and come across a sentence saying Old RED John Deere........now come on, that done it, I'm not reading a book that the author doesn't bother with any research."
3,The Loop,Although this book was enjoyable I found it took a bit of getting into and on the whole it was not well written. How ever towards the end I was absolutle glued and found it very hard to put it down. I think The Loop is a holiday read. Read it when you have a lot of time to get into it and you don't want too much brain exercise!
2,A flawed book.,"The Loop is a book that would have been so much more relevant if it wasn't so political in its hatred for and steroetypical depictions of ranchers. They are important, also. The book made them seem like uneducated savages. That is a crime that the rest of the book is not quite capable of redeeming."
2,Not a real picture of Montana!,"The author needs to stick to places/subjects on which he has more experience/familiarity. This wasn't a Montana we recognize! Another book on the same subject, the reintroduction ofthe wolves, which handles and portrays Montana much better is BIG SKY DREAMS. ""The Loop"", unfortunately, misses the loop."
2,Just boring,"The books according to my personal taste could be divided into several categories it could be soul opening of Fedor Dostoevsky (Brother Karamazov), it could be terror by Stephen King (The Stand), entartainment-adventure by Tom Clancy (Clear and Present Danger) or it simply could be a good book by Ray Bradbury. Now, there are probably thousand books that won't be put at any category for only and only one reason-they (books) are written by talentless writers. The Loop is a such book. Plot is weak, characters lack good description and so on and so on. The book is plain boring. I barely read it to the end."
4,Abridged Audio version has a different ending,"I enjoyed listening to the audio version of this book. The voice was extrememly well done. One of the best narrations I've heard. The story was gripping. So much so that when I was close to the end, and had put the car in the garage, I decided to finish up the last little bit by picking up the paperback version. (Which I own, but haven't had the time to read.) The next day, to my surprise, as I listened to the last 10 minutes, the ending was different than the book! And different in a rather significant way! Still a great car trip tape, but you should definitely stop by your public library and read the last chapter."
3,Just a story,"I love wolves and was expecting a great deal from The Loop. I was dissapointed. It was a fine story and not borring at all really. However, there was no passion, no fire. I did not fall in love with the characters. There were a couple supporting characters that were new and inviting, but most of the main characters were flat, borring, and some were plain annoying. Despite this, The Loop was still an enjoyable read, it just did not stay with me afterwards. I did not long for more of the character's lives or want to revist the land I was introduced to. If you simple want a decent, entertaining story, The Loop will serve quite nicely. If you are desiring an epic that infiltrates your mind, look elsewhere."
1,I did look again!,"I did look again and you should too Mr.Hornung because that is indeed the Lexington Hotel and not the Metropole as you stated.Believe me when i say that i know my Capone history.And getting family and friends to do reviews to counter my first negative review is quite tacky if not childish.Best regards,"
5,The Best Capone Biography,"This is a great read. I found the information and pictures enlightening and accurate. Take this book on vacation with you to Chicago...it's a wonderful tour guide. Just make sure you are packing, or carrying if you are female."
4,Unrealistic but real good,"Not a story you will be able to believe,but plenty fun..Copied from the movie BIG,the Sweet valley Twins wish they were grown up(at a carnival)and their wish comes true.They wake up in the morning as 18 year olds."
2,Shame... they are so very cute.,"Cute as a bug. But the sole is so thin, so useless, like a sheet of plastic.walking on hard floors in these shoes made my feet sad. Seriously, it was like those cheap chinese mary jane slippers, as far as padding under the feet. For this much money, i think Tsubo should give a darn how they feel.I won't buy this brand again."
2,Small!,"These shoes run very small. I had an old pair that was a 39 and fit me perfectly, but this new pair of 39s was so small I had to return them."
5,Wonderful Stuff,"Once again we have Keith Jarrett's ""Standards Trio"" in a live recording on ECM, and once again the result is a CD that is highly recommendable to anyone interested in the art of the jazz piano trio. Mixing standards such as ""Autumn Leaves"" (26 minutes!) with some Jarrett originals, this set sucks the listener in with its impeccable playing and unflagging good will. Wonderful, wonderful stuff, and if you want more of the same, ECM released a 6-disk boxed set of Jarrett's trio at the Bluenote, of which this disk is one of the constituents."
5,Does the job.,I wanted a weatherproof label that I could use in my garden to label my daylily collection. I think I will use these for other plants too. They are easy to read and hold up well in summer heat and frequent watering.
5,Ralph Towners Lost and Found very noteworthy,"I usually dont delve into specifics about an album or cd rather however Elan Vital one of the tracks on Ralph Towners Lost and Found worth mentioning certain jazz guitar albums enter the theatrical and Elan VItal one of those songs enjoyed it very much, even more so Mon Enfant gets intimate very relaxing whisks you away, the opening chords of Harbinger also sweet its nice to hear songs with the capability of taking you to another place, Taxis Waiting busy little tune feels like a taxi taking you on a ride through the streets of Manhattan taking in the sights. Towners Solstice album was note worthy however I believe Lost and Found was just as fantastic as Solstice was. Summers End, another tune A Breath Away, wow this album could be his best"
3,Umm its a really expensive Digital Optical Cable that Monster forces you to buy for the OGXBOX Component cables,"5.1 sounds the exact same on any fully functionaly Toslink cable. The hook here is that if you have monster component cables like I do, they force you to buy this obcenely long and over packaged cable.A fully functional toslink is $7 on a bad day. $25+ for this ""shielded"" toslink is absurd. In fact longer optical cables are a bad thing and can cause problems. Its an absolute must buy if you bought the monster components like I did, there is no standard toslink out, you need the adapter, which is conveniently packaged w/ this cable. What a coincidence.Sadly because Microsoft stopped manufacturing their HDTV AV pack, Monster is the only one I have found that supports 5.1 AND has no signal loss at 720. 98% of 3rd party component cables either lack 5.1 or have signal loss higher than 480p."
2,Be careful before buying this!,"It looks like they were correct, on some xbox systems once you plug in this cable the xbox dont count it as a being dd5.1/dts and dont add the dd/dts option in the audio setup menu.Now I have to see if its some cables or xboxes that are defective. :("
2,DONT BUY IT!,I bought the monster interconnects and I was getting dolby digital STEREO sound.. but no SURROUND sound with these cables!! I called Microsoft and they told me that they were having problems with these cables.. I returned them.. bought the XBOX AV pack plus I got separate normal Monster S and Digital cables.. and now I get 5.1 Dolby Digital sound from my games!!! Stay away from these cables.. since they take an anlog signal and turn it into a digital signal thus loosing surround sound info..(see the other end of the cable) I warn you. Happy gaming!
1,NO 5.1 or DTS,"I would stay away from these cables. I purchased them, and could not get them to play a 5.1 signal. Of course I checked the audio setting, but Dolby Digital, and DTS were not an option. Also, I do have a Dolby Digital reciever. For those of you that claim that this product works, good for you! Although, I can not recommend these cables because they simply will not play a 5.1 signal."
1,"Way over-priced, even for Xbox Green.","Funny how a company like Monster continues to get away with charging several times what a simple cable is worth. The green color is a nice touch, but not worth (price) extra. I bought a GE-branded optical cable at (a local store) for (price) instead. Since the cable is hidden behind my TV, its color doesn't matter. And yes, the digital stereo quality is just as amazing."
4,"Works Well, But Expensive","I use this cable to send 5.1 audio from my XBOX to my receiver. It works very well with the Monster Component Video Cable.Two reasons I gave it 4/5 stars:1) Cost - it is very expensive for an optical cable. The only difference between this one and a normal one is that a normal one won't stay attached to the Monster Component Cable.2) While the cable feels very sturdy, the rubber boot near the end has separated from the end slightly. They could have done a better job in securing this boot onto the end of the cable. After all, it is there to protect the cable and keep it from bending so much. Because it is coming off, it doesn't fill this role completely.Overall, I am happy with this cable. I now have XBMC running in 5.1 surround on the original XBox."
3,is there much difference?,"I'm not totally convinced that I can tell much difference between a standard audio cable and the fiber optic... I use all the monster junk but I'm not really sure why. It's as nice of a cable as any, I just wouldn't expect to see a HUGE difference in sound quality."
1,software bugs no support,Purchased Quicken 2003 home & business converted MsMoney files over okay but after you close Quicken then open software back up it then reverts to Quicken 2003 Deluxe. Tried several different ways to get around problem. Also tried Intuit tech support but got nowhere. Am going to try MsMoney 2003 deluxe & business.
1,D**ned if you do...,"Although all the previous reviews I've read about Quicken 2003 have been right on the money about this version of the program, no one has offered any solutions! After lots of research, I was able to get q03 to print from windows xp - open the printers folder, highlight your printer, right click and click on properties, click on the ""advanced"" tab on the top, click on ""print processor"", choose ""winprint"" and ""raw"" and click ok until everything is closed. Doing this enabled me to finally print reports and statements. Hope it works for you."
1,Agreement with support issues...,"I have to agree that Intuit's support is dreadful. I am a programmer, and I develop software for a company in Switzerland sort of similar to Quicken/Quickbooks. I felt that I had found a bug in Quicken 2002 when it corrupted my financial datafile.Now Intuit's policy is to NOT charge you for support if you actually find a bug in their software. Thing is, I did find a bug in their software (this is what I do for a living), but I spent most of my time arguing with the support rep that a corrupted datafile is most likely a bug in Quicken and not something I could cause as a user. In the end, his conclusion was that some other program on my computer must have damaged the datafile, and I should ""reinstall the software.""I really didn't need their help to try this approach, and I certainly didn't need to pay for their advice. Intuit support is quite poor."
2,Buggy Quicken 2003,"I've used various versions of Quicken for well over ten years, upgrading just about every year. Quicken 2003 is a huge dissapointment. I download transactions from my financial institutions and then reconcile the online balances. For some inexplicable reason I periodically get the error message ""The total of the previously cleared items in your register no longer matches with the ending balance of your prior statements."" I very much suspect that Quicken 2003 has a bug in its reconciliation module and that this problem is not due to operator stupidity, as I never had this problem with past versions of the software. Technical support for the product is miserable."
1,Don't Trust Intuit,"Last year Quicken Home and Business made a $12,000 error in the balance reports for my tax return. We found this error ourselves during an audit. When we requested a fix from Intuit, the reponse from The Office of the President at Intuit was, ""Sure it's a bug, but Quicken is sold AS IS with NO WARRANTY. We don't guarantee that our software does anything at all, so we're under no obligation to do anything to help you. We will, however, give you a 5% discount on the upgrade, which *might* fix the problem."" (Yes, that's 5%, not 50%)My recommendation: if you need a reliable accounting package for a small business, look elsewhere."
2,So complex....you'll never get it to work.,"Too much stuff, most of which no one needs.Seems to try to get you to pay extra $ per month for Ebill pay,when all you're signing up for is to download your banks data.I've stopped using it. My bank's on-line system works fine."
3,Not Worth The Price of Update,"I have used Quicken for about 6 years now and love most of the program. However, the 2003 version is no improvement over 2002. The didn't fix many of the bugs and added a few new one. For example, you still can't edit your ESOP transaction once you enter them. One of the new bug is you can't resize the search results window.Also, Quicken has gone way overboard with advertising. The software in now basically ad-ware, which would be ok if they didn't sell it to you. Finally, the business functions are so cripple they're almost useless. You can't even chose the columns or entries on invoices."
2,Goofy reading!,"The book is good and interesting (especially for someone with very little prior knowledge about the Corps), but the reading is absurd! He (I mean the narrator; the supporting cast is good) is so melodramatic as to be incredibly distracting. GOOFY. Only buy it if you are able to ignore the reader's voice and style; otherwise, order it in print form!"
5,Simply Amazing,This audio is a great telling of this amazing journey. Any history buff should order this and play it over and over. The facts of the ride and the aftermath of the characters will leave you in awe.
2,Great picture but no replacement parts available,"I have had this VCR for several months now and have enjoyed it since the day I bought it and hooked it up. The sound and picture quality are excellent.After a few months of moderate use (weekend movies, etc.), the power supply started acting up. The VCR has continuously reset itself while in use (losing channel information, clock settings, etc.) then locks up (needing to be unplugged to reset). I have turned it in for service, only to be told that the repair costs are greater than the cost of a replacement (thanks for the 90 day warranty, Sony).This is my second Sony VCR. The first lasted three years. With the rapid death of this one, I am giving up on the Sony Brand. Anyone have any good suggestions?"
5,dis vcr rulez!!!,"i received this as a gift and boy was i pleased. because i didn't pay for it? no! because it's a bomb vcr, that's why! great picture and sound quality from things i've recorded, and a classy looking unit!"
1,A bust!,"I've hooked up lots of VCRs and this is the only one that wanted a cable mouse! What the heck is that? 2-4 weeks to get one. Nothing worked as described in the manual. I wanted a Sony but I've got a learning disability and I couldn't figure this out. Neither could my wife who has a 4 year computer science degree. And no you skeptics, our clocks don't flash 12 at the house."
1,Very disappointed,"Although I'm sure this product is just fine, the packaging and delivery completely destroyed it, making it unuseable."
5,NOT A PORNO!!!,"Sorry ppl it isn't a porno. just a more mature show that has sexual themes such as side boob, panty shots and near nude/after sex scenes.but besids the fan service for those that are just into that stuff, it does have a pritty damn good story.well if your into the secret agent stuff with some kick ass fight scenes and are into a modern retro anime look then 009-1 is someting that you should defenatly check out. and with the cheap price tag its a bargen"
1,Not Interesting at all,"I think I'll mention its good points first. The animation and art in this series is good. The Female lead is a pretty lady. That is the only thing that made keep watching it. There is plenty of action, but it wasn't too intense because I didn't care if the main character died and the series ended. All the bad guys are chumps. They are probably related since all of their noses looked like wieners hanging on the middle of their faces. They also have really stupid sounding voices. The series is kinda like James Bond, if he were a cyborg chick with mentally handicapped enemies. I found it impossible to care about this series at all. Out of the many anime series I own, this is the worst. I agree with the review that said, ""at least it was cheap"". If you pay money for this you will probably be very annoyed."
2,At least it was cheap!,"Oh where do I begin?There's alot to be upset about but im going to be brief so I dont stress myself out again.Here's the deal. I recently watched 2 spectacular Anime series' and then I bought this. ""Ergo Proxy"" and ""Claymore"" are at the top of the game but ""009-1 is so painfully underdone and that's the problem! They should have started with the main story from the begining and built from there. They did not do that so you will have to go through 7 out of 12 ""official"" episodes before things get even mildly interesting.I can go on but that would just be nit-picking. ""009-1"" was intended for adults but has a child like appeal when it comes to story telling. I cant recommend this Anime unless the price gets down to 5 bucks and you've got 5hrs to burn."
1,Don't get it,"you will be very un-happy with this buy my honey & I were putting together a cd of adult sextoons, need less to say this one will not be in collections.."
1,waste of money,"First of all this is a suet feeder, not a window seed feeder as stated here. I bought this somewhere else but the birds wanted no part of it. Tried sticking branches in it but no luck. The mesh openings are too small. When filled I believe there is too much weight pressing on the screen keeping the birds from grabbing on. I ended up taking the roof part off & pressing it onto a standard wire suet basket which has worked out perfectly. Now the suet stays dry & it keeps out the big birds allowing the little guys to eat in peace. This was an expensive way to get a covered feeder."
4,HD,"I read the book in two sittings. I wish there were more explanation or background given for the pieces presented. I guess this book is designed for people in the profession so an excess of background information isn't needed.Having never heard of any of these teams, I wasn't exactly blown away by any of them. The one section that captivated me the most was the flag section. I love the idea of encoding all the possible graphical elements of a world flag and then displaying the output in a long color chart."
3,...journey through a life,"(I wish I could give this adventure 3.5 stars.) When one takes into account the life and times, the journey itself is more amazing than the writing."
2,Print too small for my eyes,"So I had to order it on Kindle. The book is printed in very small fonts. Just a warning for anyone with vision issues. Otherwise, it looks like a good read and the problem can be solved by reading it on a Kindle."
4,A very insightful insider's view of travel in Italy,"I travelled alone through Italy with this book by my side. It was such a valuable tool for finding cheap lodging and great places to eat. The book breaks up lodging, meals, and shopping by the regions of Italy. The only criticism that I had was that it neglected to cover the southeastern regions of Italy, where I felt I could have used the book even more so than in a city like Rome. All in all, I felt like I had the insider's track on Italy, and as a result, I had a great time and came home with many wonderful memories."
3,Clinical Studies Focusing Mostly on the Underweight,"This book is meant for people who are 1) thin or underweight and/or exercise too much 2) a medical student or one interested in the mechanics of fertility or 3) Overweight/Obese women looking to understand WHY being overweight/obese is impairing their fertility (BMI > than 27). For the average women who does not fall into these three categories and is looking for insight into her infertility, I would advise this book is not the right one for you. If you are still curious, check it out from your local library (as I did), and you won't be disappointed you spent any money."
2,Adorn is the best!,I have been a long time user of Adorn hairspray. I'm 61 and have been using it since my teenage years. My mother also is a long time user. I have tried other more expensive hairsprays and I always get a build up or my hair is too stiff. I like the frequent use Adorn. I don't understand why they have such a great product and we can't find it anymore. All the new products on the market don't even compare to Adorn. Even the Salon expensive products.What can we do to get this great product back on the market?
2,Product switch,"I ordered Adorn in the white can with red oval label as shown clearly in the ad.I received a substitute. When I called to report this I was told that sometimessubstitutions had to be made when the product you order is not available.I think this is outrageous and at the very least a customer should be advisedso that the option to cancel is available. The alternative is to try to send theitem back, and attempt to get Amazon to reimburse. This is a great deal ofwork for a very small amount of money.This is very discouraging for ordering on line.Jean"
4,Anointed worship,I encourage anyone who enjoys good praise and worship to purchase this CD. This is the first time I've ever listened to these folks...I really enjoyed their music. This is anointed music that will really minister to your heart!
5,Prophetic Worship,"This worship cd will take you to the throne of God. Their private worship with God, is evident through the anointing/fragrance on their lives. A must have for true worshippers!!!"
1,The Sound of Heaven,I bought 3 copies of this cd and all 3 of them are messed up. Really disappointed. I thought these were suppose to be new but i'm wondering now.
5,The Sound of Heaven,"This dual Cd is filled with inspired music. I first saw these two perform on Praise the Lord one night on TBN, and I wanted to find their music. The stand out song is ""Pray for Rain"". All the songs are great."
4,Used them all....Quicken is the safe bet,I'm a long time (more than 10 years) Quicken user. My only beef has been that the interface has always veered away from the Windows standards. But it never lets me down. I recently took a mistaken journey and converted to MS Money. What a let down. Money is sexier than Quicken but is missing basic functionality and can't hold my 10 years of quicken data...slow as a snail unless i purged years of transactions. The final straw...the portfolio tracking does not allow for the most basic asset allocations. Doesn't show International asset category.If you only do simple checkbook tracking either product works fine...but if you want to track your whole financial picture...run to Quicken!I ran back to quicken and life is good again!
2,Problems with Quicken 2003 H&B,"I have been a Quicken user for many years, and have never seen a product as unstable as Quicken 2003. Bank accounts that were solidly in balance somehow becomes ""out-of-balance"" and Quicken forces me to put an adjustment entry that is not needed. This then forces it out of balance, although Quicken says it is balanced. Huh? Also, the Backup utility somehow stopped working and stopped allowing me to create a backup file. I get all sorts of errors now. Maybe the other reviewers are right. I probably should switch to MS Money. Arrrgh!"
1,Wait before upgarding!,"If you REALLY want to upgrade to this version, you might want to wait until the on-line reviews calm down. I upgraded awhile ago and have to agree with the complaints that:1. It hogs memory and theefore crashes or freezes lots (and I have LOTS of memory).2. It is buggy.3. It has this wierd registration thing.4. You WILL spend quite a bit of time trying to figure it out.I am not impressed. If you still want to upgrade, at least think about waiting awhile until it gets a few fixes in it."
1,Do NOT Upgrade,"I have been a Quicken user for many years. Since I upgraded to Quicken 2003 Premier, I have had nothing but problems. Very unstable! Crashes my computer! Screens freeze! Do NOT upgrade to 2003."
1,"Too much, too little.","As a previous user of quicken basic and quickbooks, Premier version has just added lots of additional,unnessary and irritating options. Advertising for more of quickens features are displayed on every menu, screen and report/graph. Quicken basic has all the good fundamentals for the average guy or small business even, and if someone outgrows basic move right to Quickbooks Pro. Forget about messing with these useless features that add no value just cost."
2,Not good on its own,"While this book was very interesting, particularly if you're a Norse Mythology fan, you really need a real guide book to accompany it if you actually want to see where these places they discuss actually are. It should not be used as a tourist guidebook, but as a resource for learning about Iceland's history and culture."
1,"Book Disappoints, Iceland Does Not","Very sorry I ordered two of these books, one for myself, one as a gift for a sick friend. Very disappointed in two things: the writing and the photos. There are far better books on Iceland. Was expecting better quality of writing and photos. Perhaps Jon Krakuer should stick to writing (he did the photos). I thought the book would have had details of their trip, not stories of mythology."
3,"Ok, not great","The printer ink doesn't stay put - it runs, without being put under water. I bought the waterproof labels for use in the kitchen; the adhesive nature of the labels is fine, and works well, but the printing doesn't stay put while the ink dries. The labels do stick to whatever I want, including zip-top packages, but the label itself smears far too much for a quality product. Disappointed with my results, especially after I saw these advertised in conjunction with a Martha Steward printable."
3,Use of printer cartridges is excessive,"I have been so disappointed with the amount of ink this printer uses, and what a short time the cartridges last. I hardly EVER print on it any more. To top it off, I generally only print black, and yet...the magenta tank gets emptied fast. SO, does this printer use magenta for making black? I wouldn't think of printing an oversized print with it. I take my disk to a copy center, because in the long run it is a LOT cheaper. Sure...the prints are great...but who cares if they are too expensive to print on this printer? My old HP printers never used this much ink. It's fine if your company pays for your printer cartridges I guess, but my costs come right out of my pocket."
3,Dye-Based Inks?,"It's a great bargain for a wide-format printer, but you can get better results (and archival prints) for around the same price if you shop around for other models.Canon's new 9180 printer uses pigment based inks and Epson's R1800, which has been on the market for a few years also uses pigment based inks. The benefit to these inks is that they produce archival prints lasting 200+ years. Dye-based prints (such as those used in the Pro9000) have a tendancy to fade after a few years if not kept in perfect conditions.If you care about the longevity of your prints, pony up for the time tested Epson R1800 ($500 street) or new HP 9180 ($600 street) instead."
3,Broke down after 5 weeks,"First of all this is a great printer. I am very happy with the quality of the prints. I now enjoy taking photos even more because I can see the tangible results right away.But, it broke down on me after 5 weeks. It gave me a 5110 error message. When I Googled this error message, I found out that it is a common error, but it requires service attention. When I called Amazon to see if they could replace the printer, I was told no since I had just missed the 30 day return policy.That's why my review is only a 3. If it had not broken down on me, just after 5 weeks, I would have given it a 4.5."
5,What I got was what I wanted,The Canon Pro9000 is my 4th Canon printed. When I purchased the printer I hoped for if not expected the image results that I received. I use Adobe photoshop CS3 Extended to alter and print my photos and have worked on a photo for hours just to have my HP printer fail to print the picture exactly as I wanted it. The Pro 9000 has the ability to print in the CS3 environment giving true colors excelent sharpness as well as other desired outputs.
5,Great Printer,"This printer produces very nice pictures.I am very happy with the 13x19 size,so far there is nothing that I don't like about this printer."
2,Printer failure after 2 months,"After 2 months,printer fails to print , front feed never worked,all troubleshooting fails.When you pay this much for a printer the failure rate should be low.This is it, after buying at least 5 printers that failed spending 100's of dollars on inks, I feel the best thing is to buy the cheapest printer then throw it away, Sadly, I had high hopes for this. My HP all in one prints just as good of quality 4X5's, and is sub 200 dollars and wireless. I will miss those great 8X10s, however shortly they lasted."
5,Great printer for large photos!,"Brand new .... loved output .... nice details!Will update review after I produce more photos.Love that it uses seperate ink tanks! Quick shipper!Plan to use the 13"" capacity to make custom cut laser cut puzzles!"
1,Broke in less than one hour,"The Canon printer worked well for less than an hour. Then it died. Canon technical help tried on the phone for 45 minutes to get it to work. They failed. They offered to trade it for a used refurbished printer. I refused to trade my new printer for a used printer. I went through three levels of management over two days and got nowhere. Canon policy is to trade defective products for used refurbished equipment. Would you want to buy a new car, have it fail the first day, and be offered a trade for a used car by the dealer. Or, how about a defective toothbrush being traded for a used refurbished toothbrush. I will not deal with Canon ever again. I got my money back with the help of the Amazon guaranty. Thanks Amazon."
5,Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Photo Printer,its pretty large. It takes up 1/2 of my desk. I can't wait for USB wireless to come out later this year so i can put it somewhere else.First thing i printed out was a 11x8 portrait of my daughter and its absolutely stunning. All the colors are exactly the way they look on the computer.I would say that this printer is mainly for larger pictures because i printed out some 3x5's and 4x6's and the quality isn't much different than my Canon i470d which costs $50.Plus i like the idea of having more cartridges rather than having to replace an entire color cartridge when only one color runs out. I've had it for about a month now and i'd recommend it.
2,Disappointed,"I received the product, set-up was easy, it made beautiful pictures and sharp documents. The problem with the item I received is it broke within 2 weeks after I received it. Now, I have to find time to go downtown Houston or to Conroe, Texas to have it repaired. While the product was working I would rate it a 5 star item. I rated it low because I don't know how long it will work when I get it back."
1,"Canon Service Poor, I will never buy Canon product again",Bought this printer about 2 years ago. Right out of the box had to have printer head repaired but under warranty. Just a hassle taking to get repaired. Then 2 years later the print head broke again. Canon was very smug and only said that the print head is regular maintenance. I don't think buying a printer for $400+ is a deal if I have to have $100s of work done every couple of years. Not impressed. I will never buy another Canon.
5,canon pixma 9000,i am extremely satisfied with this purchase. the printer is delightful and the amazon experience was highly satisfying.
2,Poor Borderless Printing,"I have the i9900, I do a lot of greeting cards, the main reason I purchased it was because it said it did borderless printing.It will print borderless, but you get ink splashes all over the card."
2,ink drinker,I waited for 5 months to buy this printer after I was told at Comp USA that this was the state of the art printer. WRONG. This printer drinks ink and costs hundreds to keep running. I had a paper feed problem which no one at Canon either understood of cared to involve themselves with. So my $99 Epson does most of my printing. I have also found it difficult to calibrate with my Mac so a lot of ink is wasted getting the color right. Too much money for too little.
4,Good printer but very large,"I have had this printer for 2 months since excellent delivery by Amazon. It makes great prints, but to my eye the prints are not any better than the i9900 printers I also have. Perhaps the archival quality of the cli-8 ink is better than the bci-6 ink used in the i9900, but definitely not a big difference over the quality of the i9900 prints. Ink is quite a bit more expensive for the pro9000, and the cartridges have a chip to detect if you are trying to refill the cartridge. Chip can be bypassed, but at the loss of low ink warnings, and probable loss of warranty. I use Canon ink in all printers, and source images are from Canon 20D and 5D."
2,Another Printer Failure at 2 months,"I just recently got married and bought this printer to make up some photo albums as gifts to everyone in the wedding. While the pictures print beautifully, the machine broke after only a couple months of very limited use. I called customer service and was informed that the way it was flashing indicated the machine needed to be taken in for a repair or sent back. The problem with sending it back is that you get a ""refurbished"" one as a replacement. This seems a little ridiculous after buying a brand new one and using it only a few times, especially considering the cost of the machine. So do I send it back and get a used one, or have it fixed and pray the machine is not defective??I love the printer, but don't plan on buying a Canon again due to the unhelpful warranty."
4,Canon Pixma Pro9000,"This is a top of the line professional grade printer. I use it to print postcards for my business and some large photos. I love it. It was easy to install and it's extremely easy to use. The only thing, if you print black and white photos, it doesn't do a very good job on those. The color is great.I recommend this product to anyone who is serious about printing their own photos."
1,never worked well,I did not have time to figure this out and it never worked well. I gave it away and would never buy another Cannon because of this.
3,OK Quality but printing software is buggy. Revise up a bit.,"Moved to this after using an Epson R1800 with clogged ink jets that was off warranty. Was not in a position to spend $600+ on a new 13 x 19 printer. Bought this one for $350 with a $200 rebate. For $150, it is an adequate printer. But, besides the print quality being less good than the Epson (images are blurrier than with Epson, colors are not as good) there are also software glitches in the print software that are just ridiculous...For instance, when you go to print 13 x 19, the software constantly jumps back to 8.5 x 11 (which means you get a lot of useless printouts that waste paper and ink). You also can't print onto cd/dvds. I miss my Epson...==========Moved it up a star to 3, because it really is a decent (just not great printer). And, the ink consumption is not too bad--even in a situation where I print primarily on weekends (with lots of printer ons and offs)."
1,Still waiting for delivery after one month,"The printer may be the best thing since sliced bread, but I would't know because to the best of my knowledge it has not yet been delivered to the shipping address specified in the order."
1,Fails on day one and Canon wants to trade for a used one.,"The printer failed after ten prints on day one. Canon tech service spent 45 minutes on phone trying to fix and gave up. They said I could take to local computer repair geek, Friendly Computer, or exchange for a USED PRINTER. What a shock. How would you like, to buy a new car that fails on day one and be offered a used car in exchange. Shock beyond belief. After half an hour of arguing with tech service and supervisor, policy is still the same. Canon will trade new defective products for used refurbished. Customers are the quality control inspectors. If the unit fails after one second or one day they will cheerfully exchange for a used unit. Unbelievable but true. DO NOT TOUCH CANON PRODUCTS WITH A TEN FOOT POLL. These crooked people should go to jail."
4,Perfect for curious minds,"This product was recommended to me by our son's teacher. My 6 year old son loves the challenge of creating the designs that are included, as well as building his own structures. My 2 year old daughter also plays with her brother - she practices stacking and trying to figure out how to build as tall a structure as possible. I thought they might get tired of playing with it after a little while, but we've had it for at least 1/2 a year and it is something they play with at least a couple of times a week. Pieces are sturdy and have withstood some punishment- being dropped, stepped on, etc."
5,None stop action and romance!,"I am not an avid reader, but this book somehow caught my eye when I read what it was about. I read the whole book in two days, and I was enthralled from beginning to end. The love story that unfolded between the two main characters was fantastic, and the action was outragous. Nancy Allen Campbell is a fantastic author, and I cannot wait to read the rest of the books that she has to offer."
4,"Pretty good, just not as good as the first book","Nancy's first book was excellent and a hard act to follow. This one is still a fun read, but it doesn't quite measure up to the first one. But I think Nancy's doing a great job and should definitely keep it up."
3,Excessively weird,"This is pretty weird. Terje Rypdal is the composer and electric guitarist, along with drummer, bassist and strings trio. There are two or three decent tracks on here, notably Dancing Without Reindeers and Blue Angel, but the others, I'm afraid, are too weird to be pleasant. I respect Rypdal, and I'm in no doubt that this is highly artistic work, but It's too far out, mostly."
2,Kindle transcription errors?,"My comments are entirely restricted to the Kindle edition of this very useful book.The transcription of mathematics into an electronically typeset form is significantly defective here. While it is correct most of the time, there are incomprehensible lapses in critical formulas (e.g., between eqns. 1.92 & 1.93) that significantly affect readability.Buy the printed version until these cases of carelessness are repaired."
5,A capivatingly complex story by Holden!,"Holden, in Four Corners of Night, creates another ""Can't Put It Down!"" novel.Although the story line builds around police detective work and the criminal elements, it is really a story about family, friends, and complex relationships - it is definitely not just another detective novel.Holden introduces the characters, their pasts, and their desires, such that the reader feels that they have known them for years.I love it when a carefully developed story line comes together skillfully, naturally, not forced. And ""Four Corners"" is one of those books. Holden has weaved the story line so completely that he leaves the reader wondering if the book is really fiction...I have already passed my copy on to a freind!"
5,interesting and exciting from beginning to end,"After suffering through numerous books from previously successful authors Patterson, faye kellerman etc. its a pleasure to find a book that does not insult your intelligence.It is a page turner with emotion that makes it extremely difficult to put down."
2,unthrilling and uninvolving,"I had to force myself to finish this book. Only a comatose reader would not have seen the supposedly spectacular ""twist"" coming. Mr. Sensitive Guy Narrator who spent the entire book wringing his sensitive hands about his partner and himself was easily the most tiresome narrator I've encountered in this year's reading."
