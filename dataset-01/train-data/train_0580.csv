3,"Cool but forced, especially as contrasted with the film","The idea, of course, is fantastic. A premise no-one would think of. And the plot, of course, is equally brilliant (the frog DNA, the Nedry subplot). What is unfortunate is that too many people die just too easily. John Hammond should have seen his mistakes, so should Henry Wu have. What happened to John Arnold anyway? And why does Ian Malcolm come alive again in ""The Lost World""? The film, which was screenwritten by Crichton as well, makes up for some of the book's small failings."
3,The movie is better...,"**Spoiler Alert**I prefer the movie over the book. There were some things I didn't really like in the book....Like how the boy was older than the girl, and Malcolm dies. Overall, it was a fun thrilling adventure of a read. I recommend it for that reason."
4,Bambi's intellectual book review,"In this book 2 paleontolologists go to an island for $20,000 a day to come and check out the amazing Dino park, and get it ready to show off to people. In order for the Dinosures to come to life they have to Clone DNA from amber thats deep down in caves from millions of years ago. Figures something is too good to be true and something horrific happens that will change the lives of virtally eveyone on the island...I really enjoyed reading this book, it wasnt hard to follow at all, its very exciting and i just jumped in to the lituature.I recomend this book to anyone whole like tos read. If you liked the movie you'll love the book!"
5,Excellent!,"I read the book, saw the movie, and thought both were great! Good Job. If you haven't read the book, I suggest doing so."
5,Best Book Out There.,"This book is THE best book I've ever read. I've seen the movie and read the book twice, and the book is even better than the movie. Michael Crichton does tons of research before he writes his book, and in Jurassic Park it shows. The action and suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat even if you know what happens. You could read it 10 times and still not get tired of it. If you like Michael Crichton or action in general, this book is for you."
5,THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN,"IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSE!!!!!! I have read this book, like, four times, and I could never ever ever ever get tired of it! The characters are vivid, the explanations make you feel like it is real, and you feel like you are THERE! Every time you think things can not possibly get any worse than they are, MC just twists the story further! Nothing can be said to match the sheer majesty of this book!! How about a third installment in the JP series?"
4,WOW! A great Book!,This book was my first Chrichton novel I have read. It was great. Although at times it was a greusome or vulgar it was still a great book! It makes you think what if... My favorite part about the whole book is that it isn't one of those extrealmy predictibe you know it will turn out all good at the end books. THis book left you hanging at the end of each chapter! I even stayed up till 12:30 one night just reading it! I saw the movie before I read the book. The Movie left so much out. If you thouhgt the movie was good then you will LOVE the book!
5,"Realistic, exciting and well ahead of its time","Michael Crichton knows how to create realistic science fiction without sacrificing the story he wants to tell-- a real rarity in this genre. He's raised the standard for science fiction. Very few writers compare.Jurassic Park is one of his best novels. The story is well ahead of its time, terrifying and plausible. Chichton never lets the story become bogged down with technical explainations, but stays focused on the human element. A very satisfying and exciting novel!"
5,Great Book!!!,"When I first read the book, I didn't realize how much Crichton really emphasized his support for the chaos theory and the whole nonlinear dynamics. The manner in which he portrays this theory is almost convincing. After I read the book a second time, I was asking myself the question of whether this strange but oddly captivating theory was true or not. A masterpiece. If only all sci-fi/thriller novels could be as intriguing as this book is. It will leave you on the edge of your seat up till the very end. I would suggest this book to anyone seeking a thrill ride."
2,Not a good hardcover edition,"I like the book, but the hard cover edition leaves much to be desired. It is reminiscent of what one might find in an elementary school library. It is smaller than standard hard cover editions of books and the type goes so far into the center binding that often one has to exert too much pressure on the binding to read these words. Though the price may be tempting I would not recommend this hardcover edition."
5,Lex?,"Did anyone read this and NOT want Lex to get eaten? Seriously from start to finish that's all I wished for. Other than her character, the book is great. I really enjoyed it."
5,"Jurassic park, the best","So much supense in the story, and fascinating description. truly a classic piece of literature. nothing like the film. consider teading the book. seriously"
3,A good read,"It is very hard to take up the novel without thinking about the movie since it was so masterfully done. And the novel is not that far removed from the movie. So one would wonder if it is worth the time just to pick it up. The answer is : yes it is worth the read. Because it is just different enough to warrant the time (for one thing there are actually villains in the novel !). And, since it's an adventure novel, the ""prose"" of Michael Crichton being very effective and dynamic, it doesn't take that much time anyway. It is fun to read and one cannot help but wonder how the scenes, that were NOT included in the movie, would have turned out. All in all, a good entertaining moment."
3,An OK book in the myriad of diet books out today.,I have lost 50 pounds in the last year. I was having trouble taking the last ten pounds off so I thought that I would give Diane's book a try. Most of the information was interesting but I found the diet itself to be lacking a little. Stick to the 8 glasses of ice water a day and don't eat after 8pm and I think you could take off a lot of weight without even reading the book.
2,Not her best.,"I have absolutely loved Diane's other books. She brings such a fresh approach to beauty in a nice concise manner. However, I was sadly under the impression that Boot Camp would be as good. I suppose it would be a helpful book if you were, let's say, 14 and just learning. But for those of us who would go for this type of book, all of the information is old news. The journal portion is really kitschy. It is almost as if she had nothing else to write about so she took stuff from her other books, threw it together and added the journal portion in line with the current trend. We have all heard about sequels never besting the original. Save your money, I'll send you my copy!"
3,"Good, but not her best!","I really like Diane Irons' books. However, this is not her best book. It does have some good parts: the CD is very motivational, and her ideas are also good. The main problem with this book is that there is too little content. There is nothing wrong with what she writes, but the book should have included more hands-on tips. The principles are interesting but some can be found elsewhere, such as decluttering, focusing and journaling. This is not necessarily something problematic, but as I have said above, there is not much content overall. Many pages consist of empty diary pages. I think this will work best for someone young or very inexperienced in the beauty field, because whereas the basics are covered, the rest is not! I think it can also be used, as she says on the CD, as a check-up on yourself. If you are well-read or informed about beauty basics, this book will probably not have anything to offer you."
2,Dissapointed,"This book is more about the author talking to you about her preferences and idiosyncracies. It doesn't let you in on her beauty or weightlose secrets which she markets to the stars, though that's what she leads you to believe. I read the book in 1 hour and wasn't at all impressed."
2,Not Bad...only if...,"Great book great CD,only if...1-I had more time (I am a working mom)..2-The menu was more flexible and more variant(no variety)...3-If I had a strong throat for ice cold water(one of the most important points in the camp)...I just think its too restrictive...but it's a boot camp...right?"
2,Disappointed,"Much of it was practical, no-brainer suggestions..... a few helpful hints but not worth the price."
1,Don't spend your money,"Most of her ""ideas' can be found in any monthly magazine except for some of the suggestions that were a real hoot: ""apply polish only to the center portion of your nail"", ""apply honey and yogurt over body and let soak in for five minutes"", for puffy faces ""carry a metal spoon...and keep it in a glass of ice water and hold it wherever your face is puffy"", apply coffee grounds to cellulite, etc., etc. So, buy this only if you need it for the humor!"
3,"Very primitive, for people who don't have a kitchen","This cookbook is geared toward people who live in a dorm room and no access to a kitchen. Recipes are meant to be cooked in a microwave, hot plate or blender. It's not really cooking, it's just throwing together a quick meal in your dorm room."
4,Swiss Army Women's Base Camp SM STL watch,The stainless steel double lock wristband is plenty big. One thing to remember about stainless steel as it tends to scratch easily. The picture doesn't do it justice.
1,I regret this purchase!!!!!,"The watch does not work properly, I have to adjust the time every morning, I really regret having purchased this watch."
4,Very good,"This is one of the better biographies of Voltaire, and would be useful to those who have never studied the man and those who are quite familar with him. In addition to providing a fairly thorough outline of the events of Voltaire's life (it would require a massive, multivolume work for a complete picture of the man), this book also properly puts Voltaire in the context of the 18th Century Enlightenment, of which he was the brightest light.While highly-researched and scholarly, it is also very readable and does not descend into the pedantic writing style so many academics are guilty of. Both the professional scholar and the interested layperson would find this work valuable."
2,Not like the movie soundtrack,"I was dissappointed. The main stomp song from the ending was not even on there, which is the reason I purchased it.It was shipped on time and packaged well"
5,Stomp The Yard,"It's simply outstanding when old school meets and welcomes new school.This DVD was an eye opening experience that was sure to entertain,. and did not disappoint."
1,Horrible,These vitamins were expired and over a year old!Its ashame people are so devious!But they did almost arrive in two days!
2,Not this time,"I am a fan of hers. Terrific pianist,beautiful and talented. What's not to like? This album. To be fair I'm not that hot on avant garde jazz which this record largely is.My preference is when she does covers and more traditional improvs. While I admire her musicianship,this album for me is definitely a one and done."
3,A mixed bag.,"Cartoon Craze has it all -- old cartoons, new cartoons, American cartoons, foreign cartoons, good cartoons, bad cartoons, well reproduced cartoons, badly reproduced cartoons. After looking over all 39 listings and at least one duplicate listing, and with many thanks to amazonians who have taken the trouble to list episodes, I recommend three of these, as having good cartoons you may never see elsewhere -- but beware of poor reproduction:Daffy Duck and the DinosaurBugs Bunny: Falling HareDonald Duck/Woody Woodpecker: Pantry Panic (with Inki and the Minah Bird by Chuck Jones)The others are for cartoon fanatics only."
1,Don't let this book keep you from reading more of J. Krentz!!,"This was the most awful book by Jane Ann Krentz I've ever read. It's definitely dated, and there's quite a bit of 'You're my woman and I'm going to take you where I want to' and rape-that-turns-into-willing-love-making. I have read a bunch of her other books under her various pseudonyms and I really enjoyed them all. If this is your first read of hers, please don't give up, it's definitely worth it!"
4,Queen of Romance Does It Again,"I'm big fan of Jayne Krentz. Her novels never disappointed. This is no exception. The plot involves Honor Knight who tries to convinced Raven a mercenary hired to bring her back. That she is in danger. So you have the right recipe for romance,suspense,anticipation. Finally the climax of the story. If you want a great read this is it."
3,ok cover...,Cover does what it advertised but I just thought it would be a bit thicker than what I got.
5,this is not your gramma's Bob Carlisle...,"Bob Carlisle and The Allies were ahead of their time, like PFR. Many people don't know that Bob grew up listening to and imitating his favorite singer, the fabulous Mr. James Brown. The Allies rocked the house up until the release of ""Light Years."" When Bob released ""Butterfly Kisses,"" people swore it could not be the same Bob Carlisle who scorched the rafters with his incredible pipes with the Allies. The drummer for the band has an incredible almost progressive-jazz like style on some cuts. The cut ""Take Me To The River"" is reminiscent of Wayne Cochran and the CC Riders, to which Bob's voice and the horn section will testify. Come back to your roots Bob! My middle school age kid has two Allies albums on the ever present MP3 player, and is still sharing the sound with friends."
1,Not for the Ebay savy!,"I have been selling on Ebay for years and this book looked like a great way to keep track of my sales. WRONG. I could have done a better job myself! If you only sell a couple of things now and again then maybe this book is for you. Otherwise, it is 100% awful. It has actually made me consider publishing one myself to replace it! Don't waste your money. It's worth $1.99 not $9.99."
3,No connection hose,The reel seems to be a high quality product. The price is good except that I had to purchase a 25 foot length of hose to connect the reel to my compressor. All I needed was 3 feet but I could not find a source to purchase a short piece of hose.
3,NO CONNECTOR,"Good product, but DID NOT come with hose needed to attach reel to compressor and no where did it mention that."
5,Excellent Product,This hose reel is nice and compact. Its very light but very durable. I would highly recommend this to anyone with space constraints or to someone looking for something of high quality for low cost.
5,must have for surgical residents!,must have for surgical residents! great help for dictating as well as good review right before going into a case!
1,Car Charger not for Treo,I've purchased this car charger for my Treo and theorder was delivered promptly. Unfortunately theconnector that was suppose to go into my Treo 650 didnot fit (too big) so I wasn't able to connect it andcharge the phone. I send it back.
4,An Uplifting Party Song,"While this song is not among Carolyn Harding's most distinguished recordings, it is an uplifting party song that mildly encourages unity and good times to be had. This was one of two collbos Carolyn did with Soul Solution. Like the previous single, ""Let It Rain"", ""All Around The World"" also peaked at #1 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. All of the mixes are enjoyable and well produced! A worthy addition to any Dance and House music lovers' collection."
5,Pleasantly surprised!,"Had to read this for a Macroeconomics class. Thought it would be dry. Boy, was I wrong!!! This is a great book about the thought patterns of modern Americans and how to look ahead with out being too far ahead of the ""parade"". Way to go Naisbitt!!"
2,Mind (is) Set against this one,"I was given this book by a fellow professor and after reading the first chapter I was, honestly, excited to be working with her class and it. But after the 3rd mindset or so the book lost it for me. I read some of the other reviews here on Amazon and agree with most of them, so I won't bother repeating what others said well.Here's my advice:Read the table of contents - that's all you need for most of the 11 mindsets.Read the first 3 chapters of part 1.Read the last chapter (ch 5) of part 2.I'm not sure, but perhaps you can skip all that and just read part 2, chapter 5 and you'll have something to really think about.As an educator, I'm fascinated with America's general views on science and religion (especially compared to the rest of the world) and this last chapter, if a good prediction of the future, will make everyone think/rethink about what it means to be human.^^Rob"
4,Quality Product,"Very nice book. It will be useful to track expenses and revenue on my farm. In the front, the column closest to the binder is a little tough to get at, but I see it gets better as you get further into the book. It appears to be a quality product that will last the rest of my life."
2,ok,he has better music s s s s s s s s s s s s sssssssssssssssss sssssssssssssssssssss sssssssssssssss s
4,Wild Woman's Guide to Etiquette: Saving the World One Handshake at a Time,What an AWESOME resource! I am one of the first in my family to get a college degree. There were so many things that I didn't know and needed to learn. There are many things that I still need to learn. What you don't know can make or break a business relationship. I plan to share this book and others written by this author with young women attending high school and college.
4,DEXTER GORDON LIVES ON!,"This beautifully remastered CD is a joy for those of us who are too young to have enjoyed this musical genius during the 50s. My favorites are the slower tunes ""Darn that Dream"" and ""Autumn in New York"". The other four selections have a be-bop feel to them and are great, but you won't be playing this CD during a romantic interlude. Also, be warned: Whoever printed the song list put #3 as ""You Can Depend on Me"" when it's actually ""Darn that Dream"" (listed as #6)."
4,Good basic metrology.,"I have always liked Asimov's style of writing. His books, no matter how complex the subject are always very readable and this is no exception. Since I have studied weights and measures for a long time, I was looking for more depth and more obscure units than I found here, but the book does not pretend to be a work on ancient and obscure, so I can't fault it for that. If you are looking for a good basic understanding of measurement systems and units with some interesting historical sidelights thrown in, this book will do the trick."
2,Use Caution,"If you know anything about wicca and pagan practice, some of these spells are dangerous and not something you should be using. yes, it has a disclamer in the start...but why print them if they are not to be used. I leave with you the wiccan law ""And HARM YE NONE, do ye what will"". It's a known and important part of our practice that we do not harm. Many believe that what you do will come back on you, threefold. so just be careful."
4,Provocative and Informative,"As someone who usually writes their own spells, I picked up this book warily, but am so glad I did! Unlike some of the previous reviews, I believe this book has EVERYTHING to do with witchcraft AND wicca. Some of the spells, like those for revenge, are not ones that Wiccans might do per se, but it is nevertheless interesting information.Creating powerful talismans and amulets, and working useful spells is what this book is all about. Pick it up and see for yourself!"
4,Crone Spellcrafting,I found this book to be very useful in helping me create my own spells. It will stay on my shelf for a long time to come:)
3,"""Charming"" but of little value","I loved reading through this book and still pull it out from time to time, because the writing style is endearing. But I have't used a single charm - though that one that involves boiling a chicken heart in civit oil is - um - fascinating. ;-)I would think, for a beginner, too much emphasis is given to what symbols to carve and what words to say and not enough to the mental state and concentration required to make a charm or spell effective. And an experienced practitioner would be more likely to create her own charms for her own purposes. These As someone mentioned, some of the materials are obscure - and I would *not* want to try to carve these detailed symbols on little wooden disks!"
2,This isn't a good book for a wiccan...,"There is a pretty satisfying section on herbs and lotions in this book,but the spells don't please me.Some are against my morals,yet some are in a strange language I can't even understand,as an earlier reader had said.This book has magickalsymbols and their uses,but I'm sure any reader would like to know their origins.I'm not comfortable with the spells and symbols,but I think the herbal information is quite useful."
2,a waste of money,"Yo,I bought the set of two and I found them both almost totally useless. They were meant more to be used in a medievil setting, and also most of the spells didn't work. Hate to be negative, but that's just my opinion."
3,eeee.. not so good,"Information contained is superficial.Very basic on herbs. (What kills me generally when I read about herbs is that I live in Europe. In a big city. English is not my mother tongue. I know squat about herbs, let alone herb and plant names in English. I need PICTURES. As, I guess, vast majority of american readers do too).Section on charms and talismans, again kind of vague. LARGE section on observing holidays, written for a coven, which I will never be a part of. Altogether? Dunno, I expected much more.Oh, one more thing: for a foreigner, written in a language not so easy to follow."
2,It was a very advanced book,If you are a young witch then i don't recomend this book it is very advanced and deep. i myself didn't understand it until i was nearly 15. If you are ready for advanced magic go for this but if you are a beginer I recommend somthing a little less deep
2,Eight Bucks?,"I think the comment above in the synopsis about the ""old woman in the isolated cottage"" is demeaning to witch's in the first place. That's the title we are trying to avoid. Now about the book....I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I first started to read this book.But my fears diminshed,somewhat.Some spells are downright nasty! All in all the book is okay,but for the price, thats what you get. The last chapter on Ceremonies For The Year was better than the whole book."
4,The Crone's Book of Charms & Spells.,This is a great book for the advanced witch. I have read and loved this book! I recommend it because it offers a great deal of useful spells and talismans.
5,Nothing to do with witchcraft? I beg to differ!,"Not all witchcraft is the nice, post-Gardnerian stuff that we find in Ravenwolf and Cunningham. Ms. Worth's teaching are diffeent, yes, but most people taught by family trad have ways different from other neopagans.This is an excellent book of various charms and things, and wonderful suggestions for new workings. I enjoyed reading through it, and i believe Ms. Worth has given us a book full of interesting new and unique info. It is a shame we cannot tell her thank you on this plane of existence now."
2,Not too great...,"This was my first spell book and by far the worst. It had NO spells in it, only charms. And the material needed to make the charms were extrememly hard to find. It did have some good talismans on it though."
3,"Not a practical book, but charming and quaint","Most of the spells and rituals in this work are so complex and intricate as to be totally impractical for a contemporary witch.However, there is a delightful charm to the work, and its old-fashioned Victorian-style language makes me think I've actually found some old crone's book of spells. Spells for love, healing, cursing, revenge, and peace are all mixed around each other, like you'd expect in a private book. There is no attempt to impose modern magical morality; as was the case not so long ago, the magic is a tool, neither good nor evil.There is a marvelous assortment of talismans and sigils, which to me more than make up for the rest of the book being all pretty-words and impractical metaphor.Again, not a practical book at all, but one that I enjoy having on my shelf."
2,Very difficult stuff here...Not for begginers....,"Of all my expierence of practicing Wicca, this book here has got to be filled with the most difficult and advanced spells I've ever read of. Several of them could be described as IMpossible.Many of the items crucial to do them are either very expensive, or are only available in certain parts of the world! This being said, im sure that they're much more affective because of the lengths needed to go thru to complete any of these."
4,Sandi Patti voice of Heaven,"Sandi Patti opens up Heaven when she sings ....this is the song that they played at my Moms funeral celebration while her slide show was on, it was perfect...God must smile when people sing this song...."
1,NEVER USE THIS SELLER!!!!!,"This item was supposed to be ""like new"" but instead it was a copy of an original. It doesn't play in ANY of my devices and the CD is of a sub-standard quality. Wish I could have given it ZERO stars!"
1,Not What I Thought,"I wanted to see whether the saint Paramahansa Yogananda had published a translation or commentary on the Gita. My search led me to this work. Only later did I realize the controversy surrounding this author, his expulsion from the Self Realization Fellowship, and the prior work by Sri Yogananda himself on the Gita (God Talks with Arjuna). The latter is in my view a much superior work."
1,Not as good!!!,"This book does not compare to the two volume sacred and scholarly classic God Talks with Arjuna: The Bhagavad Gita by Paramahansa Yogananda published by Self-Realization Fellowship.Self-Realization Fellowship was founded in 1920 by Paramahansa Yogananda as the instrument for the worldwide dissemination of his teachings. Readers can be assured of the authenticity of anything written by the great saint if, and ONLY if it is published by SRF.Pass this one by."
5,Video of Swami Kriyananda on this book,Length:: 5:38 MinsListen to Swami Kriyananda himself explain the value of this book.
5,A New Scripture is Born!,"This book is spiritually thrilling! It's the most inspiring book I've read since Autobiography of a Yogi. Where Autobiography fills you with inspiration, The Essence of the Bhagavad Gita shows you how to proceed. If you are a spiritual neophyte or if you have been practicing meditation and yoga for years, this book will overflow you with inspiration, clear practical guidance, and hope like never before. I read a little every night before retiring and smile in spirit as I drift into sleep. I cannot recommend it highly enough!"
5,This is a really good book for python keepers,"not much to add,but in general I can say that this is a professional book with all information for experienced pythons keepers,who want to know more."
3,a choppy beginning- a magnificent end,"there are so many girls at the may of teck club ( group housing for 'the girls of slender means)- with so many third person points of view, that one almost needs a chart to keep them straight- who's rationing what? who's dating whom?a few of the girls stand out, but their tales are so intermingled, & their lives so distantly described that i had a hard time caring. but as a fan of muriel spark's work, i kept at it, and was well paid off by the poignant & shocking ending.spark did quite the job of showing the reader wartime london- with its' almost purposeful frivolities, willfullness to get on, and its' crushing realities.i recommend it to fans of her work. i suggest starting with the 'prime of miss jean brodie' if you've had no prior introduction."
2,The body has a life of its own.,"This small novel has too many characters and too many themes (intelligence work, coupon smuggling, the 'literature' business, religion, sex and love -'Love and money were vital themes in all bedrooms.')Also, the allegories are a little overstretched, e.g. a bomb for a war that didn't end with the armistice, or the fate of the girl who believes that 'once you admit that you can change the object of a strongly-felt affection, you undermine the whole structure of love and marriage.'The action of the latter part of the novel is caused by a deus ex machina.On the other hand, it gives a lively portrait of poverty-stricken London after World War II with food-rationing. Also, the elliptic writing and the use of poem excerpts were captivating.But all in all, not a convincing work."
1,Got the wrong bag color,"We ordered a red crumpler salary sacrifice, instead we got a black one, which is considered cheaper.When you buy this item , pay attention, although the page contains other colors, like red and blue, they probably have only the black color, which is available at a lower price in other e-shops."
3,God has more names than 99,"This is a nice book especially if you're learning Arabic---that is how to read Arabic because the Calligraphy is large. The introduction gives good and necessary info. This book gives the major names (99)however; God/Allah has 2,999 names. The book is simple and easy to use. It would have been nicer if the names were colored or colored in."
5,A remarkable debut by a band full of raw energy!,"It's exciting stuff, simple yet deadly effective! Even if you've been fortunate enough to hear these guys live, they still sound more vital, more likely to make you form your own band than anything else out there. You probably won't hear a better CD all year long!"
2,Not too much there,"The textbook has poor illustrations and is meant as a guidebook to the ADAM Interactive Anatomy 4 Student Edition. One would do far better purchasing Netter with the CD, plus the ADAM Practice CD if you like to quiz yourself with the pins in anatomical objects. The ADAM CD is facinating as it allows you to slowly dissect the subject but it lacks many landmarks. I still feel as though the scope of Netter is far superior."
2,Wait for the bug fixes,"There are many useful features in this edition. It's a shame they don't work. One of the most heavily used features is Find; it finds things and displays a list properly, but gives no links to the View in which the item exists! You have to use the dropdown lists for each of the Views to actually find the View for the item. Find worked in Version 1, so someone must have fixed it. The product is virtually useless without Find, IMO."
2,Middlin' yarn,"The Sign of the Spider is really two books: a wordy late Victorian romance novel, which bloats the early part, and a fun adventure cryptozoology yarn in the latter part. The 'hero', really an anti-hero, doesn't really make us yearn to follow his activities, as much as we want, rather desperately after a while, someone more Indiana Jones-like that we can root for. All in all, the style and padding make this only a modest read. Too bad too."
1,Innacurate description,"The actual product looks great. But the item description states that it is a DVD, but in reality it is a DVD CD-ROM, which can only be viewed through a computer. So make sure you contact seller before purchasing."
1,"High expectations, low results","This book is about 52 pages of fluffy reading if you don't count the big font, inapt quotes and over spacing. All the info in this book can be found on the internet or on Ayana's website. I purchased this book because I went on her website and was impressed with what she had to say regarding going natural. However; this book is a really bad attempt at capitalizing on the ""going natural"" craze. There is nothing new or inovative in this book and furthermore, I really wish a woman of Ayana's statue would write a book for the thinking person. She's a thinking person. Why assume that all who are interested in what she has to say are complete idiots that would be impressed with this pamphlet (and I'm being generous by calling it a pamphlet)? Come on Ayana. Stop joking around and give your fans something they can sink their teeth into, or should I say sink their hair into."
1,Not so pleasant smell,These wipes leave an unpleasant after-smell. I've only used one towellete and can't use because of the smell. I haven't tried any other scents so I'm not sure if it's just in the peppermint scented wipes.
5,It really works!!!,"This Daewoo DVD player is definatly a ""code free"" player the manual is simple to understand and the setup options are easy,but people should know is that many DVD players that are ""code free"" will register as region 1 on both the box and on the player itself so don't be discouraged.. Some electronics experts told me that these players and recorders are modified outside thier facility--Whether that is true or not I don't know..I tried this player with a PAL formatted DVD region 0 and it plays like normal. Anyone who has import music cd's with bonus DVD material (PAL formatted) will benifit from this player,It's a really good buy!!"
5,Works as it is supposed to.,"Works just like it says it does. I found by shopping around, a better price can sometimes be found, but the ease of Amazon Prime, with the 2 day shipping, is just hard to beat."
2,cheaply made,Product was not as it appeared on the website. It is very thin and cheaply made. I doubt it will last very long.
4,Great Information On Past Events,"I bought this book for a educational psychology course. Typically, I never keep my books after the semester ends. However, this book I decided to keep, because there is so much information about event in America that I have never heard about. This book covers many multicultural historical events and aspects that are important in my opinion to know."
3,Good Stories,"These are good Southern stories...one stands out as truly special and touching: Kimberly Brock's ""Never Promised You a Rose Garden."" The book price is worth that one alone."
4,Great travel reading!,"I bought this book unsure what it was really about. It is a compilation of short stories of life in the south, some bringing a smile and others a laugh. I purchased it to have something to read while traveling and it was the perfect book. I could read a story before bed or catch a couple while on the plane without worrying about having to re-read the last couple of pages to remember where I was when reading a regular novel. If you have ever lived in the south, most stories will bring fond memories. If you haven't had that particular pleasure, then this book will give you a taste of what life is like. The one thing I didn't like about it? It ended too soon!"
4,Like sitting on the porch and chatting with friends,"This is my kind of book, good stories and great recipes! Several 'southern' writers have gathered their favorites...in both foods and stories and these stories make for a wonderful summer's read. From the dilemma of what to do with the (somewhat functional) outhouse that the man of the house just can't let go of, to the rememberences of our first time at Vacation Bible School and the original ""what would Jesus do"" we all struggled with at a young age, these women have tapped a vein of southern storytelling that runs sweet and deep. Some will have you laughing out loud, some will send you back in time, but all are infused with a real knowledge and love for the south. Danna Ball, Sandra Chastain, Debra Dixon, Virginia Ellis, Nancy Knight and Deborah Smith combined for the 16 stories tht will enchant any lover of southern fiction."
3,Enjoyable read,"I really enjoyed this book! Being a Yankee myself, it was fun to get a peek in the the way of the Southern Woman. The stories were short and humorous. Even though I'm from the North, I could relate to so much of these stories because when you come down to it, no matter where you grew up, it's all about family!These ladies share hilarious events from their personal histories which makes it all the more precious. Truly an enjoyable book. So grab cup of coffee I mean Sweet Tea, and this book and have a nice read!"
5,LOVED this book,"I bought this book because I'd just finished reading Mossy Creek by the same group of authors, and I was NOT disappointed. I've loaned it to one friend and have another waiting. Wonderful, wonderful."
5,funny,"this is a great book. very funny, found myself laughing outloud a lot. i love books like this. they leave you wanting more."
5,Amusing and Quirky!,"The title ""Sweet Tea And Jesus Shoes"" hooked me in but the funny anecdotes kept me reading. I was sad to see the end of the book getting closer."
2,disappointing,I bought it because it came up that it was by Deborah Smith but in reality it is by several authors. I love Deborah Smith's books but even her one chapter in this was disappointing.
2,Not ideal for make up wearers,"If you wear make up, this is not the cleanser for you. I was so excited to try and all natural product, though the price was higher than I wanted to spend. I am bummed out!! It doesn't get my make up off and I am left using a second cleanser to do the job. I guess it's back to Clinique for me."
4,Far Wes--but not that far out,"I bought this for Harold Land's appearance on the first 7 tracks. Wes contributes some nice solos, but it's an ensemble effort, and he's not the sole focus. Monk Montgomery displays some flash on the Fender Bass.It's laid back jazz, not the dazzling display of virtuosity of some of Wes's Riverside work. If you don't have the major albums he made for Riverside, you can put off acquiring this without missing anything essential."
5,Excellent,"I saw this yesterday at a listening station at a Borders store. I gave it a try and found, to my delight, the magnificence of Fleisher's playing of Schubert's last piano sonata. It was only later that day that I discovered the greater meaning of this disc, for it is the first disc in decades that has a recording of Mr. Fleisher playing two-hand piano pieces. After suffering from dystonia in the right hand for years, he recently received treatment and again received the performing use of his right hand. A portion of the proceeds of this disc goes to the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation. These facts make the sweetness of his playing on this disc all the greater."
1,The Last Supper,"The movie has an interesting idea that encouraged me to watch it in its entirety. The weakness is the script, with long dialogues that seem disconnected from each other, making the movie seemignly slow and long. The actors are natural and the movie is shot in the perfect background and environemnt."
4,barbarism vs civilization,Great movie! It is a must see for people interested in Latin-American or Spanish American Studies.
3,Glad to have it in my library - but....,"I found this video to be hard to use. Nate breaks the song into sections which is a good way to learn. It would have been nice if there was a way to repeat a section or go back to a mark other than the beggining of the song. Some accompanying tab would have doubled the value and made it much easier to follow. I think this would be most useful to someone who could already play the song but wanted to add some authenticity to the presentation. I expected to spend hours with this video learning these songs, but I haven't gone back after the first viewing. I will some day!"
5,A Gem,"This book is thought provoking, encouraging, and convicting. I was changed in the reading of it. Buy it, read it, again and again."
5,Excellent Paschal Resource,"I purchased this book to read during our family devotion times leading up to Easter, and it did not disappoint. All of us became more aware of the deep suffering of our Savior as He moved through the days leading up to His crucifixion.I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to fix their attention on what Christ suffered so that those who would repent and trust Him could be counted as righteous. It is appropriate as a read-aloud for families with children as young as middle grade school. Younger children can benefit just from listening to the discussions and from hearing Mom and Dad reflect on the Passion of Christ."
2,Disappointed,"I was rather disappointed with the selections and the orchestras that were featured. For such a large collection I thought I'd enjoy more of what was offered, but overall found it boring. In addition, I felt the audio quality was poor. In fact, there's only one piece out of the entire set I can say I really enjoyed and liked the performance. I would have found it a much better buy had there been more interesting and popular selections chosen. In hindsight, I would have done better buying individual discs rather than the collection."
5,#1 Wiggles Fan,"My 3-year old loves the Wiggles videos, so when this came along, I had to get it for her. She listens to this every day on her way to grandma's house. Her favorite is Dorothy the Dinosaur. The tunes are so catchy that she has her 2 brothers ages 12 and 13 singing along with her."
5,"Wiggles wonderful - Parents, watch your spelling!!",This Cd is fantastic! keeps the children amused while we are driving and shortens the journey time too!I'd just like to say that there are a number of parents who review items who apparently can't spell the simplest of words. Check your spelling before you send!!!! You are setting a bad example to your kids by not being able to spell even simple words!
3,"stupid, yet funny!","its so dumb , its funny , i.e. fruit salad , theres some guy saying ""yummy yummy yummy yummy FRUIT SALAD"" all emotional , thats why im getting it for friend as a prankster gift, but really getting him a gift card."
5,Excellent!,"This is one of their best CD's, and they are all good! You won't regret spending money on this one, and your kids will love you more. :)"
4,hot potatoes!!,my 2 year old boy really loves wiggles.His favorite shong is hot potato~~ with dances.
1,Buyers beware,Beware of this seller.. If you dont do what shewants then she will harass you and will not leave you alone.. Beware of Marenson228
2,Yummy Yummy,"I ordered the Wiggles disc ""Yummy Yummy"" which was the title on the disc holder but the disc inside was ""Top of the Tots""."
4,Innate Ability,"Oscar Peterson, who ought to know, said once during npr interview, ""anyone can play fast"". maybe tatum could play fastest but that's not the bestest. Listening to this is like watching a 12 foot person play basketball. I've been listening to Tatum for 50 + years and it remains one of the deep pleasures of my life. If this were the only kind of recording i had, i'd be bored long since. a curiosity for once in a while. so buy it, hear it, but don't think you've heard it it all. get the Norman Granz solo masterpieces series and the Norman Granz Group Masterpieces series. lifetime investment. Volume four of the solos good start, but any disc...you'll hav e favorites..., volume 8 of the group series, with Ben Webster ,is one of the greatest treasure among jazz recordings. With Benny Carter on volume 6, there are a couple blues tracks and the whole disc elevates life. this stuff is astonishing, but in the long run its the rest of his oveure that will become part of you."
4,Soft but dramatic,"I've never heard anyone quite like her. Simple but interesting lyrics, full symphony. The music and her voice are very soothing."
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this CD specifically for the song, Se Meg, which isn't available on US CD's. I was extremely disappointed! I guess it's time for me to move into the 21st century and get an MP3 player so I can pay 99 cents to download a song rather than waste my money purchasing an entire CD. Lesson learned."
1,very poor,it's has very poor holding end. The screw driver fell apart the end slide off to easy. I would not buy this again.
2,inshore CD,"was ok but really didn't apply to North Carolina Coast , not C.D. faught but fishing is a little different"
2,Ok video for beginners,"I've been fishing since I was a kid and thought this would help get me familiar with saltwater. Most of the fishing I've done is inland on Freshwater. Mostly Lake Erie, but also in freshwater lakes all over the US. I'm new to saltwater and looking for a good video to understand the tide and fishing from shore as well. Offshore salmon fishing in the pacific is great but I don't want to pay a charter everytime I want to go fishing."
3,"Sizzles, but only a couple of explosions","I heard this the first time in Hong Kong in 2004, so it isn't as new as the publication date in the States might suggest.It's a pretty good collection of home-made European hip-hop stuff, lots of French and middle-Eastern influences (also some Dutch stuff from Suriname, I guess), ambient noise, musique concrete, snippets, cut-ups and samples.The first three or four tracks are awesome, then it gets a bit iffy and picks up again nicely towards the end with a couple of really good tunes.It's by no means horrible, but isn't a stunner all the way through. What's good is very good, but what's mediocre is, well, terribly mediocre.Try it if you like ""abstract"" hip-hop and something cool and unusual.Great for hipsters, arty types, vipers and dinner parties..."
3,Thanks Jerry.........,"The movie is alright......but the bonus is having the one and onlyJerry Lewis helps by lending his voice for one of the Characters.Even the animators did their best to not only hear Jerry , but to seehim through his character...good job guys/gals.The movie itself is not too bad...3 stars."
4,Yo soy un feo!!!,"I love the cd. If you are buying this cd because of the Columbian soap of the same name it only has the theme song, but 2 versions of it. There's the ever popular salsa version, & the original version that uses an accordian. (I believe that's the instrument used in this version of the song.) It's mainly a Salsa cd. So if you like salsa this is a good cd for u. Enjoy!!! Un FEO"
1,No sirve - Abysmal quality,"Carlos Mejia Godoy es el mejor compositor/cantante de Lationamerica, pero en este CD se paseó. La calidad de la grabación es tan puerca que no dan ganas de oirlo una segunda vez.Carlos Mejia Godoy is the best composer/singer in Latin America, but on this CD he blew it. The quality of the recording is so low that you will not want to listen to it a second time."
5,Wind & Water Proof!,"This jacket is totally wind and water proof, to the extent that it does not allow air in or out. As a result, you sweat in it. It can get very hot and clammy if the sun is out, at all. But, it will definitely keep the rain and wind out."
4,Surprisingly nice for the Price,"I bought this jacket not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. Don't expect it to keep you warm whatsoever (it has no lining), to keep you completely dry in a hard downpour (although it did keep me dry washing my car), or to give you much protection from the wind (it's extremely thin). On the other hand, if you're just looking for a light jacket to put on when it's drizzling out, this is perfect.The Carbon color is quite nice. It's coloring is identical to theColumbia Sportswear Men's Cougar Peaks Jacket."
2,Smells great but scent is too strong,The first time I applied this to my dog the scent was so overpowering it gave me a headache. The scent was strong when first applied but it did not last very long. The only reason I am rating this product with 2 stars is that it kept my dog's coat shiny for a few days. That is the only positive aspect of this product. I'm going to keep looking for a better dry dog shampoo.
5,Loved it. Get your tissues out. & Watch the extra features Clips,Loved the story and how is played out. The quality wasright on and was well worth the money. Would recommendthis movie to others
5,When they say complete they mean it,"A very useful book for both the beginners and advanced cooks. The beautiful photographs give you and idea on how the final dishes should look like,best of all, the book is fairly priced. One of the very best books in my collection."
5,Good Pasta Book,"As a housewarming gift, I received this book which weights 5 earthly lbs., which is for the serious cook--not for the faint heart. My former love and I utilized one recipe of the Saffron Risotto which resonate a very good entree shared with four people. The recipes are good for large parties which we used this for a dinner party. The quality was very creamy and moist without any dryness and nor swimming in an ocean of water or salt. This book mainly comprises of traditional Italian staples that are native to the culture of pasta, limited soups, Risotto with the least concentration on meat. It is good for vegetarians or foodies who focus less on meat. The photos are incredibly deceptive to draw foodies to prepare the entrée. I would recommend this book for the beginner or advanced cook as the instructions are relatively easy to follow and understandable. The ingredients are somewhat difficult to attain for select entrées."
2,Not very good,"I attempted to follow a lot these recipes exactly, almost all were way off or too bland for consumption. I'm hoping this not indicative of all W & S cookbooks, but this is not a good start."
4,Pasta Perfection,"For those who adore pasta, this book is a bonus. For those new to the pleasure, this book will hasten the love affair. Straight forward text presentation, plus informative images, insure a number of memorable dining experiences."
1,Completely Disagree,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There was absolutely no plot. Nothing. It was a complete waste of my time and taught me nothing about the Cuban experience in NYC. I love most Cuban movies, and all movies by this director. But, el Super was horrible!"
1,Ripoff - Save your money,"This is a ripoff. Save your money. I have seen charts published by BarCharts and free ones provided by Java Report. I expected this to be as good, but no where near.I wonder publishers like AW can publish such thing and put up a list price of USD 5.95.Of course that is the negatives of buying some thing without seeing. I dont see how some other readers found it useful.Rather than spending money on this, one is just better of copying a few pages of Nutshell books and pasting on the wall.A free poster from Java Report just came in. That is much better."
1,One size does not fit me,"Technically I could get this on and zip it up but it hit the trash can shortly thereafter. Trying for a good Dr. Girlfriend costume and because this purchase did not work out abandoned the whole concept. I'm guessing the model is about 5' tall because on my 5'10"" self the skirt was WAY too short for public (even on Halloween). The quality was really cheap and I cannot imagine trying for a ""Jackie O"" look in this mess."
1,big disappointment,"There has been a lot of fascinating research recently about the biology of transcendence. But you won't find it in this book. What you will get is a personal reconciliation of his Christianity. Not that that's bad--but it is not how the book is represented. A fundamental problem with this book is one that bedevils (so to speak) many works by authors who write on subjects outside of their field of expertise. Pearce is a theologian (apparently). He is not a physician, physiologist, biologist, or anthropologist--and this really shows when he writes about those subjects. The theology is OK. The physiology is ho-hum--the same any intro course would give--except that he strays into details that are unfounded or absurd. As for the anthropology--whew! where does he get this stuff? Ancient cities from 20,000 years ago?! Early Americans that were 7 ft tall?!! This the stuff of fantasy and unfortunately really discredits his attempt to study the phenomenon of transcendence."
2,Hokum Pokum,"If you're the science type who goes out and enjoys conerts and people and ""experiences"" then you'll swear this guy must be married to a kindergarten teacher. But if you're the type who's kind of bookish, and likes to stay home you'll probably like this book."
2,Pseudoscience,"I was shocked by the sheer amount of pseudoscience in this book, from the central tenet that the heart is literally a brain, to the notion that the planet Venus passed Earth in historical times on its way to the current orbit. In all fairness, the book is at least politically balanced: It brandishes the liberal idea of the noble savage and the paradisical state of the pre-patriarchal societies, but at the same time echoes the lament of conservatives through the ages: That young people today are greatly inferior, intellectually and emotionally, to their ancestors. Never mind that all of these views are contrary to any coherent scientific worldview.The book is recommended in so far as it makes a good case for spending quality time with babies and children, and there is some realistic science related to brain development in that part. The rest of it, however, seems more like science fiction than science fact."
4,Liberating WomanHood,I had to watch this film for a class on Latin Studies in my college. Thought it was very well written and directed. There were many points that hit home and showed the brutal honesty of even today's society.
2,Ermm what was I thinking?,"Ok well to be honest it was the price that made me get it and being Blu Ray. Content is generally crappy, make no mistake about that but if you want some cheap nonsensical entertainment for a few bucks well then its a maybe. King Tut was the better quality blu ray from memory. otherwise hardly worth remembering anything about them."
4,Good baseline book for those preparing for a dissertation,"As a Ph.D. student that is about to start my dissertation I found this book extremely helpful in wading through the various research and analysis methods. Filled with examples (although principally focused on Psychology), the book has helped me plan my dissertation. A great reference book and in my opinion a must have for those who are about to start their dissertation."
3,Waterproof until you get water in them.,"I bought these shoes for a vacation to Costa Rica where it frequently rains. When I put the shoe on it clung nicely to my feet, and I was hoping it would be enough to keep water from pouring in. It doesn't and once this sucker fills up with water, it's over! Also, my foot got EXTREMELY hot, there is no breathing in this shoe. With that said, I think for cold rainy days when I won't be subject to sloshing through deep water, these will be great. If you want them for traipsing through the rainforest and wading in puddles, get some waterproof socks (or go bare inside shoe) and some mesh drainable shoes like solomon tech amphibians, or my favorites, New Balance SW920's. With those shoes you expect to get drenched and will appreciate the water draining out and nice comfort too."
3,Not Waterproof,"As a year-round bicyclist and resident of the Willamette Valley in Oregon (where it rains a LOT), I need shoes that definitely don't hold water! Unfortunately, these did not keep my feet dry; in fact, after a thirty minute ride in the rain, the shoes and my socks were completely soaked. Fortunately, customer service at BOGS are really great and stand by their product: they sent me a different pair of BOGS for free, to replace the Osmosis. The woman at Bogs who helped me said that they've had problems with this particular shoe. A friend of mine has a pair of Bogs and she swears by them. I have yet to try out the Timberlines that Bogs sent me. I'll vouch for the Osmosis being true to size, comfy, and keeping my feet warm on dry-weather walks though. And I am very satisfied with the excellent customer service I received from the company (the replacement shoes shipped out same day and arrived very quickly)."
5,Best shoes ever,"I ordered these just in time for a nearly record setting wet spring in VA. I had a pair of Bogs Osmosis that I bought several years ago and wore a LOT, they started leaking at the flap at the bottom of the laces, that was sad. I highly recommend these shoes, I wear them in tall grass, mud, light snow. They are very comfortable and I hope this pair lasts at least 5 years."
4,Replaced BRK 4120B,"I just replaced my 8-year old (at least the house is that old) BRK 4120B smoke alarms with this first alert model. There are 8 alarms in my house. The old BRK units began to fail by going off, not the low-battery chirp mind you, but the alarm, around 4AM until I disabled the whole system to figure it out. After re-enabling everything WITHOUT the interconnect wiring I found that 2 were bad. Rather than just replacing them I decided on a complete upgrade.I thought about another brand such as Kidde, but in the end purchased these. I bought 2 individual and one contractors 6-pack (also from amazon), so the price was right. The installation went very smoothly. The only worry I have is the age of the included batteries. I didn't see a date on the units themselves as some others reported.I plan to take better care of these with regular battery changes. Fingers crossed."
5,good product / great replacement,"I purchased 2 of these to replace some old AC only detectors that were probably 14 years old. Since the wiring and boxes already existed, install was easy. My old harnesses were slightly different so I did have to replace those, but no problem. I saw some other reviews about the 9V batteries not making good contact and causing units to chirp indicating low or batt issue. I have not had that happen. The batteries seemed to make contact just fine. Good products and awesome price. Local hardware and retail definately did not have this good of price"
3,NO Hardware included,No mounting screws or wire nuts included so I had to come up with them myself. After the install issue the unit is working good so far.
4,Four Years and No Problems,"I just purchased the 9120B combo smoke and CO detector for my home. I plan on replacing one of the smoke only alarms that is hardwired with battery back up. These are all through my home and were installed by the builder in mid 2008. No problems with them. I have only had to replace the batteries one time. I had one that started the random chirping even after replacing the battery. But, I cleaned it well, not just the surface, but the inside using ""air"" like you would for a camera and a small brush. That took care of the problem. If you have pets, as I do, I it's easy to get dander and hair in the alarms; dust too. Keeping them clean inside seems to be the trick. I've had several neighbors tell me they cleam them inside every year. They haven't had problems either. Hope my new Smoke/CO combo works as well."
1,Alarms not really complete.,"These alarms work fine. However, since they are hard wired, they need to be attached to the ceiling. There is nothing with them that enables them to be attached to the ceiling. Therefore, I cannot use them."
1,frequent false alarms at night,frequently goes off at night. i replaced all six alarms and still have the problem.
1,False alarms,"These smoke alarms are awful. They are the same ones made by BRK. They constantly have false alarms. They started to have false alarms the first week I put them in. The only good thing about these were the false alarms would only go off using just one alarm instead of the whole house and it would let you know which one went off. The false alarms were very annoying and we have 3 small children, so it was great fun at night."
2,"Excellent shipping, avoid this manufacturer","I bought 3 of these smoke detectors to replace old dectectors from the same brand (First Alert) in my house. The ones I was replacing had problems with beeping inappropriately.Of the 3 I bought, 2 worked fine. One had to be thrown away because it would not stop beeping, even after following ALL suggestions for stopping random beeping. It is just defective. If you look at reviews for First Alert smoke detectors on various sites, you will see that First Alert seems to have the lowest customer satisfaction of any smoke detector brand. Apparently they make a low quality product and then don't even bother to test them before shipping."
5,The Power of Prayer is encouraging...,"I'm not one to read a lot of christian books, but this one is excellent. The book basically restores your faith and teaches you how to pray and live. R.A. Torrey paints the picture plain enough to understand and apply it to your everyday lifestyle. Through the pages of this book I have become a better christian, believer, and follower. In addition, I wouldn't say that this is a book you can read in one day, it's definately a book that you read and meditate on because of so much vital information. In closing, this book should be in everyones library, young and old.God Bless~"
3,old-fashioned prayer,"Many post-modern readers will likely find The Power of Prayer old-fashioned, simplistic, and maybe even starchy, but also biblical. For Torrey, power in prayer is inextricably linked to holiness of life. He repeatedly says, ""We must study the Word of God every day of our lives to find out what the will of God is, and then whenever we find it, do it every time.""The Power of Prayer is fundamentally a primer on prayer but also a celebration of prayers answered. Torrey draws heavily from his personal experience and from the Bible to teach Christians how to pray. If there was ever a time to dust off this classic book on prayer it is now."
1,I'm sorry..,"This hardly compares to Torrey's CLASSIC 100 pg. pocket booklet, 'How To Pray' which every christian should read. 'TPOP' just doesn't cut it for me."
5,Best Cleaner for Contigo Cups,"People are smoking crack if they don't think this stuff works. The directions suck and they really don't tell you how much water to use. The only directions tell you to use 7 ml and the rest are worthless pictures. I probably ended up using more than the recommended amount, but after two hours of soak time my contigo cup looked brand new. The inside of the cup was a nasty brown And now it's perfect. I tried using ice, salt, and lemon juice but that didn't do anything."
5,Katana for coffee stains < cuts right through!,"After careful review, I decided to try this for the grind-and-brew Cuisinart coffee carafe. 2 squirts and swish - added hot water to about 1/2 full and swish - let sit a few minutes and there were NO stains left behind. Absolutely the bomb. I am thoroughly impressed."
5,Amazing Product,"My office had Clearly Coffee in the kitchen. My so-called stainless steel or metal coffee mugs were stained with brown coffee stains. No matter how I tried to get them out, I was not able to do so. I used Clearly Coffee and could not believe the result. They came out as spotless as they were when I bought them years ago. I bought a bottle to use at home. I highly recommend this product."
4,Great Percolator Cleaner,"I add several drops to my percolator, add some water and brew. I rinse and wipe down the insides thoroughly. You must clean a percolator regularly or the flavor of the coffee will diminish."
3,Cleans up coffe makers,This one was for my caffeine-addicted wife. No complaints; it works.Who knows? Maybe it'll clean something that I use...
1,Not able to clean a really dirty pot,"I needed to clean the stainless steel thermal pot on my Bunn drip coffee maker. Sadly, this product isn't able to even touch the staining coffee oils enough to soften them so I can brush the pot clean. Heck, even a stainless scrubby won't even remove the oil stain in my pot!If you clean your pot at least twice a week, or more often, this product might work Ok but if you seldom clean your pot don't waste your money on this product 'cause it's not up to deep severe coffee pot cleaning.This product is for something besides coffee pot cleaning since it doesn't do that very well."
5,I'M LIFTING UP THE NAME OF JESUS !!,"A TRULY JOYOUS WAY TO CELEBRATE IN JESUS NAME THAT THE FABULOUS HELEN BAYLOR SO BEAUTIFULLY PERFORMS !!SHE SHINES THE BLESSED SPIRIT OF JESUS IN ALL OF US !!THIS SONG SHOULD BE PLAYING ON ALL THE RADIO STATIONS ROUND THE WHOLE WORLD,AMEN TO THAT BROTHERS N' SISTERS,SHE'S THE GREATEST !!!!JOEY HOFFMAN (USA)"
2,NOT GOOD FOR RUNNING,"I began serious running about a year-and-a-half ago using cheap running shoes. Everyone kept telling me I needed to upgrade before I injured myself. I finally went to a running store where I was fitted with a pair of Brooks Beast due to my over pronation. As I first started running in them they seemed fine, but with each training run they became more uncomfortable. By the end of a month I was in such excruciating pain I could not run a full mile. I switched back to my cheap shoes and had immediate relief from the pain. I was back to running 10k distances in a few weeks. People who walk in these shoes seem to love them, runners seem far less taken with them."
4,Faithful for years,"I have been wearing the Brooks Beast for many years and thousands of miles. I am a ""heavy"" runner who puts in 700 - 1000 miles a year, and alternates my Beast with one other style. The Beast solved my foot and leg pains, as well as allows me to continue high mileage. They are a great shoe."
2,Disappointing for active children,"I'm a huge fan of LeapFrog toys. But this one never clicked for my twins. When they were younger it took to long to accomplish each turn and as they got older, it was just boring. At every turn, the game tells kids what to do, then they find a letter card and put it in a special slot. But there's just so much talking and singing going on, the kids get bored. They want a game that moves quickly and this one doesn't do it."
4,"Not for me, but","You know, I found this game to be quite annoying (there is a lot of singing in between each players turn)- but my 5 year old son loves it. There is no dice, no spinner (so none of those pieces to lose :), but it tells you how many spaces to move. So, one player with an easy question may get to move 8 spaces, while a player with a hard question only gets to move 3 spaces. I guess that's a plus because you can't cheat (it even tells you which color you land on), but in the process, it makes the game rather simple. My son would rather play by himself so that he doesn't lose. The questions are not challenging for my son (he just turned 5 in May), so i guess it gives him a since of ""Hey! I'm smart, I know all of this stuff""."
2,Pieces...,"You know, I had lots of games with game pieces when I was a child in the 70s. My closest sibling was four years older, so we weren't interested in the same games at the same time when we were young. My kids are DELIGHTED to get a game. Currently, they are 8, 6, and 3 years old, and we still have issues with losing pieces before we've played the game more than a time or two. And, nowadays the games all have thin, flimsy pieces which are easily bent, torn, and mixed up with all of the other game pieces out in the game room. I guess this would have been a great game, if it were the only one we had and the pieces didn't get scattered and lost right away.Game manufacturers: PLEASE make the pieces more sturdy, and provide packaging to hold them once the game has been opened."
4,Great game!,"Like most Leap Frog toys this is a fun and educational game. 1 to 4 players....so a child can even play alone. Be careful with the cards, however, because you can't play if you lose even one."
3,OK Movie,I am a big fan of William Blatty. This movie is certainly worth a watch. Some may like it better than I did. Some may not. I thought it was decent enough; certainly different.
2,5 star movie ....0 star DVD...equals 2 1/2 star rating.,"I love this movie...and have been anxious to receive the DVD.....and was amazed to see it was coming out with a director commentary, deleted scenes and alternate ending!This is all too much to believe for a fan and the bad news is as follows: The commentary is great, the featurette is fine , although it was widescreen and is cropped for full frame thus chopping off copy and on and on..but the worst news of all? The transfer is disgusting...poor color correction and dirty beyond belief. You will enjoy the fact it is on DVD if you are a fan but DON'T get your hopes up that this will look like an improvement over your previous video tapes etc."
3,Blur Boundaries,"It is the US movie in a post-Vietnam line of exploring psychiatric effect on servicemen involved in different military projects.Mix of paranoiac, mystic, gothic while boundaries between professional researchers and their objects, asylum and outside life are really blur and invisible sometimes."
3,What's with this disc?,"'The Ninth Configuration' is a wonderful, strange, and ultimately profound movie.That aside, what's with this DVD edition? I understand that the elements used were perhaps the best elements available. But there's some problems with the transfer.First, there's a loud, piercing hiss throughout the first half of the film. Okay, now, maybe this is attributable to print damage. But what about the brightness? I had to substantially turn DOWN the brightness on my display because the image was abnormally bright. The letterbox bars were gray and not black because of this.That aside, there's some nice extras on the disc that make it worth the purchase price anyway."
1,Can't view,"I guess I'm a total moron. I only saw where it said ""All Regions"" on the order page. This disc will NOT play on standard DVD players. Guess what - WHO THE HELL HAS A NON-STANDARD DVD PLAYER?! STOP SELLING DVD'S THAT DON'T PLAY ON STANDARD DVD PLAYERS!!!! GO SELL ON AMAZON.UK IF YOU WANNA SELL PAL DVD'S!!!!"
4,Like it or not God exists,"I have watched this movie since the 80's, and I never grow tired of watching it from time to time. W.P. Blatty takes on fear, loneliness and God with a dash of mental illness for flavor. Vets of all people just can't admit their fear, and unwittingly become slaves to it. Fear and faith are both things that mankind struggles to understand while courting an addiction to science. Science cannot even explain human love, yet we cling to it, like dope, hoping that maybe next time it will work on our problems. So, what is truth? It's unfailing love in the heart of each human being; and science is grievously jealous and impotent."
2,Misleading,"As the previous review stated, this only comes with one arm. What I thought was a really good price on this, turned out to be a rip off. I can find a pair of these online for about 140-150. Having to buy two of these, no deal at all. Returning and buying something else."
1,Que Pena!!,"Recuerdo cuando temas como ""satania"", ""hasta que el cuerpo aguanate"" entre otras, te ponian la piel de gallina. Ahora esa sensacion parece que no se volvera a sentir.Desde el lansamiento de ""Gaia"", el grupo cambio muchisimo tanto en lirica como en musica; seria tonto dar ejemplos, vasta con comparar los trabajos que le preseden a este con los que le siguen para notar la diferencia.En resumen, ya el grupo no vale un centavo. La musica de Gaia II parece musica de bar de la edad media y canticos de marineros borrachos.Gaia II: Un asco. Sus temas ecologistas y de superacion no sirven, el ""viejo"" mago de oz no volvera."
1,De mal en peor!,"Nunca he sido un fanático de Mago de Oz, pero he tenido (lamentablemente)la posiblidad de escuchar sus discos, nunca me han gustado la voz del vocalista ni tampoco las temáticas de las letras de sus canciones, aunque le ponen mucho sazón a las letras yo creo que es demasiado, y en este disco continúa reflejándose esto. Ya ni siquiera hay creatividad para sus canciones. I hate them!"
5,Sencillamente espectacular....,"Para los que no han tenido la oportunidad de ver a Mago de Oz en vivo, les comento que son la mejor banda del mundo en directo, cada canción parece que estuviera sonando en el cd, pero en realidad son ellos tocando en directo.Creo que Jose es la mejor voz que yo haya podido escuchar jamas, podria ser comparado con Timmo Koltipelto (stratovarius).Y simplemente gracias Txus por existir y crear canciones que tocan el alma y duermen nuestros sentidos......"
4,"Misleading title, but good music nonetheless","The title of this recording seems very misleading. Although one will find most of Cannonball's most popular work (songs) here, the title should have read something like ""Live Cannonball"", since the entire recording is that of live performances with his band that included Joe Zawinul and his brother Nat Adderly. Truthfully, Cannonball did very little of original significance with Capitol Records. With that said however, I still enjoy this recording very much. The two featured bands really cook, Cannonball is at his soulful, playing best, and the digital sound production of Michael Cuscuna is typical par excellence. So despite the misleading title, I consider this a strong recording and a good introduction to Adderley's music."
2,Pecular Mix,"Cannonball Adderly recorded in two styles - serious jazz and pop/soul. For the jazz listener, this CD has only two of Cannonball's best jazz tracks - Jive Samaba (a recording borrowed from Riverside Records) and 74 Miles Away. Other tracks are not as good as they could be. For example, the CD includes Work Song but Capitol itself owns a much stronger version of Work Song that first appeared on Cannonball Live - an LP apparently not converted to CD. Jazz listers interested in the Cannonball's Capitol years should try ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy - Live at The Club"" which, despite the title, has a lot more real jazz."
2,Look elsewhere for Adderley...,"To be direct: Cannonball's best work was not recorded with Capitol. Better recordings of Work Song and The Jive Samba are available on superior albums, and Mercy, Mercy, Mercy shows up on superior compilations, as well as on the wonderful same titled '66 album. Fiddler is good, but the album isn't worth the one track. Unless you're a Weather Report fan looking for some early Joe Z, steer clear."
2,disaster disappointment,"First movie ""Apocalypse"" was a wash out. Story line was weak and special effects were terrible. Second movie on disc was better, except for the constant jerkyness of the camera which I found very annoying. The story line was much better and had moments of emotional substance which came across in a dramatic way."
4,10.6,"Well worth the price. Great Quality. Even though the script is a bit cheesy, the special effects more than make up for any bad lines."
1,Very poor quality,I can't believe that a Bluray movie has so very poor image quality (Worst that a VHS)
2,Good thing the DVD was cheap,"Category 7:I'm the type of person who likes almost every movie out there. Hence why I still gave it 2 stars. I recognized some of the actors in the film and that helped the movie out a little at least. Even for a made-for-tv movie I'd say it wasn't that good. It started out really slow and we kept debating wether or not we even wanted to continue on watching it. But we did, and it got a little better as the movie progressed. I doubt I'll ever watch it a second time, but I'm not asking for those 3 hours of my life back either. Needless to say I still haven't watched the second movie ""10.5"", but probably will when I have no more new movies left in the bin to watch."
1,Brutal,This is the worst of the worst. TV disaster movies. With the biggest disaster of all: Kim Delaney on bloatload. Man she could miss a meal.
4,Lots of fun for my 3 yr old!!,"My daughter loves this book. She likes to ask everyone in the house what they'd like to eat and then fries the egg, makes up the sandwich, etc. While I understand that the previous reviewer was disappointed with the lack of ""proper nutrition"", I feel the food choices are basic, simplified and fun. If I have any issue with the book, it is that the pieces can be difficult to fit back into their puzzle-like spaces. (The pictures need to be aligned exactly, or they won't fit back in.) Still, a very good purchase."
4,Truman reading his masterwork.,"I only just discovered that this a CD of Truman Capote reading passages from his masterwork ""In Cold Blood."" Mychael Danna's music has a haunted quality that perfectly compliments the author's voice. Listening to this singular artist read his own words is too brief a treat, I only wish there were more."
1,Large V not a true V,"I was disappointed in these blocks, especially at the high price.I figured the least they could do at Starrett is to complete the larger V in the block.Each block has a small complete V and a large V that rounds out at the bottom so it is more likean opened up U; this makes it impossible to get square stock in the larger (so called) V.For the life of me, I can't figure out why people that make machining products would do this."
4,"Inexpensive, but worth it.","This Generic Multi-Tap for PS2 is succsessful for PS2 games only.Whether original (fat), or New (slim) ,it does its job for a very reasonable price!This is as good as any name brand; honestly. {:-)"
3,multi-tap controller for ps2 systems,"it got to me on time, but i wasn't aware that it only could be used on certain games"
1,Terrible customer service and order cancelled,"I was looking forward to getting this product in the mail, alas, it has been discontinued. Nevermind the fact that the status says ""In Stock"" on Amazon. Nevermind that they gave me no reason in an email notification that the order was canceled. Unprofessional company. Musician's Friend exists only to screw you out of your money and not deliver!"
2,Was great now very out of date,Almost everyone of my group of Grand Canyon boaters owned this guide and it was great but now it is so dated that it is hard to recommend. Many of the rapids have changed and new ones have formed from the early 1990s. The flows have also changed. It would be great if someone would bring this up to date and print it on waterproof paper.
3,not bad,not a serious fan of this kind of stuff but just letting the maggots and funkateers know that bernie worrell plays organ and keys on here.
5,True Gospel Classic.,The Tommies are the best Choir I ever heard. I reccomend this album to all who love great gospel music.
2,This was definitely less than I would prefer,I considered the recording of poor quality. The fidelity was a long way from the blu Ray recordings that I have been getting. I would dearly love to find a good recording of Petrushka on Blu Ray. Does one exist? I realized when I bought this that it would not be of the best but I hoped for better.
5,a few cool songs,but 50 bucks? um they sell it on the official site autographed for 10.Im considering it myself. Heck even ebay is cheaper then 50
2,Tattin' Madeline,"This book isn't the best way to teach kids about tattling. I do like how it teaches kids the consequences of tattling, such as, having no friends and being made fun of. It also talks about why kids might tattletale. The pictures and lyrics seem kind of old fashioned."
4,Tattlin' Madeline,"This book was suggested on a substitute teacher website as a good resource for handling tattling in the classroom. It clearly illustrates tattling and its results, i.e., classmates do not like a tattletale. The book also gives clear guidelines for when to tell a teacher, such as when someone will get hurt. I am planning to use this book in grades K-3 this year."
5,for teachers,I read this book to my elementary students and also use it as a reminder when needed. It helps the kids know the difference between a report and a tattle.
1,BEWARE!!,"I bought the packaged deal with the Vacuum hose, Hose Adaptor and the Weighted Butterfly Pool Head. Got the box and NO BUTTERFLY VACUUM HEAD!! Very poor customer service here!!!"
2,Not impressed,"We had a vaccuum head for our pool that worked great. This one does not. It's not very heavy and doesn't have a lot of suction. It does clean the pool, but it takes double the time of other vacuums."
4,Hydro tools vacuum head,I ordered this hoping that it would work better than the one that came with my pool. It does! The weight of it keeps it on the bottom of the pool which makes it easier to use. I would recomend this to anyone looking for a new inexpensive vacuum.
2,Not recommended for Pebbletec Pools,"The brushes make it difficult to push along the bottom of a pebbletec pool. I had better success cleaning our spa using a vaccum head that rolled. The brushes kick up the leaves before they can be sucked up, therefore to use this head you have to hover it above the bottom. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Never underestimate the power of these brownies.,"I do not know what is in these brownies to cause these reactions, but hear and heed my warnings. I wish I'd read the truth, the naked truth, the unvarnished and ugly truth:1 Brownie - strange tummy rumbles. Sounds like thunder. Caution, you want to be near the plumbing fixtures.2 Brownies - Thunder, plus the most unexpected gastro warnings. Think a high wind on the Sahara. You might want to move the chair closer to the bathroom. Start practicing your prayers.3 Brownies - You should just make your bed in the bathtub. You'll be there all night.More than 3 Brownies: The refrain: ""Dear God in heaven"" is heard echoing against the porcelain."
2,I REALLY wanted to love these!,"I agree with all the other reviewers who say these are just like ""regular"" brownies, with a rich chocolately flavor and great texture. I agree, they taste great, and go down really easily. However, it's what they do to your body after eating them that I object to -- you will get really awful gas! It's not just me, it happened to my entire family, my husband, and both boys, teenagers. Not pretty. I don't think it was the sugar alcohol that caused the problem, but what was it? Who knows? I am so glad I didn't go crazy and buy a case before I checked them out. Just be cautious!"
4,"Rich, satisfying chocolate treat without the guilt!","These CarbRite chocolate chip brownies are a real treat when you are craving a rich, gooey treat! Chocolate chips can actually be found in the baked brownie. The brownie cooks up moist and really satisfying. I am a chocolate lover! The chocolate flavor leaves absolutely no funky aftertaste. It is moist and really pretty good. In fact, I bought four boxes this time.... saves on shipping. The brownies will not be as thick as a fat-laden one.... but they really are the best low-carb chocolate dessert I have run across.. Enjoy!"
3,"If you have to completely avoid sugar, this will do","I'm diabetic and need to watch my sugar consumption, but I'm not dead yet. With just a couple of these brownies, I had gas for about two days making for uncomfortable moments at work. I'll look for something else."
2,A touch odd,"I can't get enthusiastic about these. They didn't taste exactly like brownies, and both my husband and I had stomach problems with them. We were not gorging on them, either. They lasted 4 days. Doubt that I will order these again. (never say never!)"
3,I ate it.,"As I reformed brownie addict I found these brownies very edible. The texture isn't quite right, sort of like fudge with a thin cakey crust. All the chocolate chips sank to the bottom of the dish, making them difficult to remove. Never-the-less, I found myself hiding them from the kids and my chocolate craving was temporarily tamed."
4,Good Stuff,"These brownies require a little unusual preparation, but they taste very good. The only reason I give them 4 stars and not 5 is because they make you go to the bathroom."
1,[WEAK],"...It claims to have 20 songs, it only has 10. Picture quality is poor, because it is taken from [another] tape.Sound is not bad. There is no menu. A total [disappointment]. ...Wait for the official release from either Numan himself or IRS Records..."
4,LouLou,Just watched it. It is a good film; slow but accurate and interesting. Don't think you need to buy it but worth watching once.
4,A Great Find and addition to your Asimov collection,"I found this at a thrift store in an old ratty paperback edition and, as an Asimov lover, I had to have it. The 25 cents I paid were well worth it. A detalied but not lengthy murder mystery that Asimov approaches like no other. It doesn't have anything to do with robots, which is ok. Asimov's whistful sense of the future and knowledge of science, the cliffhanger, and suspense show true in this find. An excellent read and magnified by the fact by the unique view of Asimov as the diverse writer he was. By far not his best work, but in his 'experiment' into the murder mystery genre, Asimov hits a home run."
2,Lot of pictures and few contents,"This book is a neat collection of photographs which show the several appearances that a minimalist garden could take. Some of them are very well know for anybody who has read a gardening book once at least. Tadao Ando, John Pawson and Claudio Silvestrin among others famous architects had been chosen as well as icons in minimalism concept like Ryoanji Temple in Kyoto. There are few pictures from a wide range of gardens all around the world and a brief explanation of each one. There are some hints of what minimalism is, but it is not a deep and accurate publication about minimalism and the way a garden should be built following minimalist principles. But if you are looking for a book with beautiful and inspiring photographs and very well designed this book is what you need."
4,"Makes it seem achievable, but it's not easy...","After reading the book, I found myself still interested in attempting a voiceover position. But I knew there was still alot to do and prepare for in ""the business."" Alice does not mince words, nor does she make you think anyone can just walk off the street, make a quick copy on their cassette or tape player, and run into a recording studio to make money hand over fist. She is honest, sincere, and knows what she is talking about. I realize I have many things to do, including getting a professional tape and professional training."
4,A return to the old Pro-Pain!,"This is a much better album than their last couple efforts. The muddled, sloppy thrash sound is gone, replaced by their familiar (and much better) grind-core style. Check out track four for some classic, ruthless, old-school Pro-Pain!"
3,Amusing but with much superfluity,"Interesting insights into the personalities involved during the last decades events. Reads like a popular highbrow novel. It's the sort of thing you'd expect to be serialised in something like the (British) Sunday Times.It is certainly not a bad book by any means if you skip much of the superfluity present, often seemingly to highlight the authors access to particular personalities.However the books complete omission of the role the US played both at an economic and political level compels me to come to the conclusion that this book is seriously flawed in its objectivity.There are many other books that will deliver you that objectivity, check out Stephen Cohen for one."
4,A Indispensable Account of the Human Side of the Story,"As other reviewers and readers have noted, Freeland's book _The Sale of the Century_ offers a vivid account of the human side of the story that is so essential to grasping the magnitude of what really happened in the Russian Nineties. The narrative clearly reveals the author's exceptional competence in the area of Russian current affairs. Her familiarity with the turns of history so central to Russia's shaky experiment in marketization makes this work indispensable for the student of contemporary Russia. While the myriad anecdotes, names, and intricate descriptions of events can definitely require slogging through, a careful reading will be an excellent education in the political and economic history of contemporary Russia. Also included, scattered amidst the detailed journalistic narrative, are intense historical insights on the nature of Russia's destiny and self-image in civilizational history. Overall, highly recommended."
5,Wow,"This book is awesome. I teach adult ESL, and I'm always looking for supplemental material to use in my class. I used these centers on Monday, and the students loved them. The centers look so nice when laminated and having them each in their own packet is great. Nearly all of the centers were challenging for the students, but lots of fun. They didn't want to quit when class was over! I'm sure elementary students would love them too. This product is great. I highly recommend it."
5,A Quality Work!!,"I have this book and I am so glad ,I discovered it. I am, a painter,and have always been influenced by Van Goghs work. However most of the books I own do not have very good quality , printing .This book however is excellent! It is very close to , standing in front of the original painting. I would recomend this book to anyone that loves Van Gogh. I am so proud to make this book a part of my art library. Get it while you can!!"
3,Not bad..,Interesting to read things about Vincent that I hadn't heard before. Guess my main disappointment was none of the paintings I was wanting the book for was in the book. It was interesting to see some of his earlier paintings. Many of the early ones don't look anything like what I've come to recognize as his. Could hardly believe the skeleton head was done by him. =)
5,PERFECT!,"Perfect product, perfect, prompt shipping! I was very excited to receive the product- and when it arrived I was more that satisfied with it!"
5,sailor moon,This ROCKS!!!! for all sailor moon fans who have been waiting for this now there isnt even a long wait! now after only about a month in between the second season is coming out! this is soo very exciting! the first season was incredible! anyone who is a sailor moon fan cannot be complete with out this box set!the first season was incredible no doubt that this will live up to the first box set if not better!
3,Kind of a disappointment,"This box set was not nearly what I was hoping it would be. Not only did ADV use dub terms for Sailor Moon's weapons, but there is also a section in episode 68 where they used the dub track instead of the original Japanese. Added to the fact that episode 67 is missing (which isn't ADV's fault) there are no extras to be found on these disks. ADV should have looked at the Pioneer releases of Sailor Moon to see what kind of quality they should be aiming for, as they are far superior to the R box set."
2,sigh,"If you intend to make a bare-bones DVD, at least try to make sure the video and audio are up-to-par. Not to mention preview and opening placements. It is as if all the money for this project was placed into the box art itself. This is a real shame for stateside fans who have waited so long. ADV could have gotten better quality just by ripping the R2 import DVD's, slapping a sub-title track on it, and selling that. Many people would have been willing to pay more if the quality was worth it. A real shame that Pioneer didn't wind up with the license. The worst part of this is that ADV has nowhere to go if they even wanted to make a better quality version. In all honesty, I would have been perfectly willing to wait a year or so more for ""restored"" versions..."
1,Sailor Moon - Season Two - Uncut (Japanese Language Edition),I pay for it and i thought it was the real US one but i receive a bootleg. I try to contact the seller for a refund but one respond i will never buy from this seller.
4,one thing bites. . .,this is the most fantastic (and painful for serena) season of all sm seasons. but one thing bites is finding the english subtitles in this jap box set. i mean i finally get to see what DIC had deleted but it kinda hard to see what the original voice lines is. took me 3 dvd players to find the english subtitles.
4,The Best Uncut Season!,"I love Bishoujo Senshi Sera Muun, AKA Sailor Moon. I looked at this set shown here, and I saw that episode number 67 was missing. I also noticed that the pictures were different from the one ADV has on its website. I don't know if it really is just a typo, or if there really is no episode 67 in this version. this cover is more politically correct though, because in ADV's they have Sailor ChibiMoon where Dark Lady is on this one. And Chibimoon didn't appear until ""S"". In ""R"" we see three forms of Chibi-Usa, Chibi-Usa/Small Lady, Dark lady, and the Moon Princess. If you love Uncut Box Sets like I do, You can order the ""S"" uncut box set from ... it is an import and has all 38 episodes from the ""S"" season, where Pioneer only put out 37 episodes even in their uncut format on DVD, without the box. If you want, email me at ... becayse I have asked ADV about the covers and the ""missing"" episode. This is a GREAT season and will be even better even if they don't have the episode 67."
1,Worse Than the Season 1 DVD Set,"Since I owned season 1 DVD set, my expectation of season 2 was lowered accordingly. Unfortunately, the audio of season 2 is even worse. I wish the fans are not that forgiving of ADV, because by lowering the bar, you are going to guarantee lower quality in the future. The only thing we know for certain is that since ADV has the North America distribution rights, we are not going to see a decent release in the forseeable future. I bought the set to watch the series, but I am not a satisfied customer of ADV."
3,Edits,My God! They Edited It! They Edited The 2nd Opening! It Destroyed Everything! RIP Them Now! Do Not Buy It.
4,This is a great set.,"Despite the price tag, this is a wonderful set to own.If you have only seen the english dubs before now, trust me this is vastly superior. It tells the whole story behind these wonderful characters.The rating for this is 13+, this is a bit high in my opinion. I think you could show these to a younger child without problems, but it is best left to the parent's discrecion.My only problem with the set I have is the audio quality in some disks. They sound as though someone was running a lawnmower in the recording studio at the time.Other than that, it was a joy to watch."
1,WARNING!!!!,"This is just a note to all Anime DVD collectors (as well as Sailor Moon fans). DO NOT BUY ANYTHING THAT SAYS PERFECT COLLECTION UNLESS IT HAS AN OFFICIAL LOGO ON IT (E.G. ADV, MVM, MANGA, ETC). DO YOR RESEARCH. ONLY BUY FROM REPUTABLE DEALERS. A CLUE IS THAT FAKES WILL BE REGION 0.I bought the 4 disc Sailor Moon season 1 DVD and the quality is bearable and watchable, but the CD is a little more PRONE TO SCRATCHES (more like a audio CD)than a proper official DVD. The problem isn't all that bad tho. But the DVD smells of bootleg.Please Amazon, get your act together. Stop supporting these pirates as the fans want the real thing."
5,Episode 67,"As taken from www.advfilms.com""*Note: This release does not include episode 67-despite ADV Films' every effort, it proved impossible to secure the masters for this episode.""Everyone is saying that they have a filler for it and that 67 was boring anyways. As for people saying that the performance of the dvd is low quality, you have to remember that they are taking the original cartoon UNCUT. The sound of course is going to be off. I really enjoyed Season One UNCUT and the subtitles aren't distracting at all although I first thought that they might be. I recommend this to anyone who likes Sailor Moon and have seen the edited North American ones because this is the original in the true way that it was meant to be and wouldn't you want to enjoy it just as how everyone did in Japan when it first started? Yes it is costly but it really is worth it."
2,Season two Sucks in Japanese Audio........,"Like I said in my review of the season one box set......DON'T BUY IT, IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!Update: Reported by ICv2 in April 2010, Toei is now offering all 200 episodes refurbished of the series for internatioal soliction( I don't know if they included the two specials and the three movies though(please have someone answer that part)). Sorry it came so late."
1,disappointment,I am a runner and a advid reader. I purchased this book hoping it would give me some insight as to how she completed and trained for a marathon. This was not the book's goal. It turns out to be her life's story.
4,Divine Energy and Purple Love,"In an age that is no longer gilded, Purple Love will become a classic. As families struggle through the destruction of the WTC and the loss of countless lives, Purple Love can step in and be a source of inspiration, closure and hope.The extraordinary illustrations of Goro Sasaki and the timeless message of Susan Faith will urge your family to take a new look at death . . . but more importantly, a closer look at the miracle of life itself. The loving, trusting relationship of Sarah and her Mother may cause parents to stop. Slow down. Think about teaching life's true lessons. Love. Trust. And, a child's place in the universe.In ""Purple Love"" Sarah learns that the cycle of life does indeed go on. As adults, we learn to contemplate a different message to confront the inevitable task of helping our children understand death. Purple Love is just that refreshing vehicle to offer alternatives in discussing life's most difficult subject, with hope and love at the center."
1,Not the same as pictured,"I ordered from amazon specifically because of the advertised pacifiers blue baseball and red, and received one of their other styles instead, green with a pink star, and a solid pink one. I'm having a boy so I'm returning these very feminine ones. This is a common problem for Amazon with products that come in different styles, they don't allow style selection or you may not know the vendor has the product in other styles."
3,Bittersweet,"I had been searching EVERYWHERE for these! I thought, ""Wow, these are the only pacifiers my daughter will use and I found them here! I'll buy them all!!!"" BUT...when I got them, they turned out to not be what I expected. In the picture, it looks like the ends are slightly angled (like the ones she uses now). They look as if they are made for a baby with a higher pallet. The ones I got in the mail turned out to be the new orthopedic ones...BIG AND ROUND. NOT what I expected. Long story short, she will tolerate them, but prefers the angled ones better. Are all the companies making them big and round now?Here are some pics of the one she likes and the one I got in the mail. The one on the left is the one she likes.[...]"
3,Quick Read,"This is a very short book. Even slow readers can finish it in less than an hour. The information in the book was interested, but a little out-dated."
5,Heart Challenge for Leaders,"Nouwen uses the temptations of Jesus in the desert to help leaders analyze their motivation and methods in leading others for Christ. This small, easy to read book possesses amazing depth, yet is spiritually challenging for even the most experienced pastor. Nouwen hits the ball out of the park. This classic should be read by all church leaders."
4,Solid and Concise,"This book is not just for formal Christian leaders, but for anyone who wants to be focused on what is really important in the Christian life. It is really short, and you could definitely read it in less than 2 hours (probably closer to 1 hour). But it will remind you of what being Christian is all about--being genuine and vulnerable, and loving others through that vulnerability. It is a beautiful picture of leadership, and about how as a leader we can be set free to be ourselves and enjoy God and love others. In a lot of ways, Nouwen shows how the most effective leadership is very simple and has been done for a couple thousand years. It's about emptying ourselves, taking up our cross, and sharing that journey with those in our care. This book is well worth the short amount of time it will take to read."
5,Super book!,"I first read this book in college with my fellow resident assistants. I've also read it many times since then. ""In the Name of Jesus"" is short and challenging. It's terrific.I'd recommend this book both for those who've never read Nouwen and for those who've read all he's written."
3,"More of a pamphlet, really.","This book is a transcription of a speech Father Henri gave on Christian Leadership in the 21st century several years ago. He encourages leaders to flee from desire for relevance into contemplative prayer; to flee from personal heroics into confession and forgiveness; and to flee from possible power into the mind of Christ.While it is a solid pamphlet that many will benefit from reading, it lacks the profundity and depth of some of Nouwen's other books, most likely simply because it was written as a speech, not a book.Father Nouwen is still my favorite Christian writer, and I envy those who were able to hear this talk, but I like some of his other books better.discuss? williekrischke@hotmail.com."
5,Vash the Stampede Rules!,"The first time I watched the first episode on this tape, I was hooked. This incredible series is Action-packed and hilarious at the same time. Vash is a total dork when he's not fighting, but when he is, he is a stud. I really recoomend this series to anyone, anime lover or not."
1,Boring and I hate the humor!,Animated comedies suck. The series is not at all what I thought it would be. I thought I was getting a gun sling action worth the money animation. Instead I got a boring not at all funny now in my trash DVD. If you think your getting an action flick or even a good movie; think twice. The cover completely fools you.
1,Woweee...what a nice frisbee I have,"Dispicable...truly NOT funny, truly VERY annoying. I hated seeing it in my apartment so bad that I had to do the next best thing....put it in a waffle maker, then the toaser, then the oven, then douse it in lighter fluid and light. That was the most exciting part of the dvd."
1,One of the all-time worst,"I hate anime comedy. I'm not going in to any detail with this DVD, because it sucks. Final Criticism: Story line - Sucks/ Animation- Okay/ Overall - Don't bother, don't even consider it."
4,Surprisingly good,"I was a bit hesitant to rent this DVD since I'm usually not a fan of comedic anime (I prefer the romantic/dramatic variety), but based upon a friend's recommendation I decided to give it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised by this first Trigun disc -- it was quite funny and sweet, and the light plot contained deeper undertones than expected. The animation was quite good, although episode 2 did possess some strange fuzziness that was a bit annoying. I haven't seen the rest of the series yet (I plan on renting them from Netflix ASAP), and so far I don't love it so much that I would purchase it, but I think any anime fan will like Trigun and thus I strongly recommend it."
5,TENGO DOS ADOLESCENTES EN CASA,"Y ME CREES QUE VIVIMOS EN PAZ? ( BUENO, RELATIVA !)Este librito hizo milagros con mis hijos junto con el de Tus Derechos como Adolescente""Te recomiendo los dos.Son el paso a la cordialidad"
5,The Best TLC CD YET,The girls of TLC really know how to sing and they know how to treat there fans. This CD is filled with catchy songs well thought lyrics and great back round music!!! My faveorite songs are NO SCRUB and SILLY H@ ...If you do not have this yet then you need to get up and buy it!!!!
4,This new wave video is cool.,I think TLC picked a perfect time to return. This is the year where you can do as you please and We all love it.
2,{T}otally {L}ousy {C}rap,"That describes this much-anticipated follow-up to TLC's 1994 smash, ""Crazysexycool."" Unfortunately, too much hype and such high expectations might have been what killed this album. For one, the style here is soooo much different than their previous (more enjoyable) albums... I wouldn't call this album hip-hip but rather scratchy, robotic, flashy techno album that lacks substance. The usual charm of their light, sensual R&B grooves are gone. Now there's ""hardcore"" garbage like ""I'm Good At Being Bad"" or ""Silly Ho."" It's pathetic how they try to drift in with the new fads. ""No Scrubs"" and ""Unpretty,"" which by coincidence are also the only singles so far, are the best songs. Track #8, the ballad ""I Miss You Much"" is okay, but the rest is just horrible filler. I can't for the sake of me understand what TLC was thinking and doing, but regardless of this stinker, I still love them and admire their other music. If you want their true talent, pick up ""Crazysexycool."""
1,This album disapponted me truly.,"TLC is well known for recording good music. In this case, I would have to disagree. Not only was it bad production, but bad vocals. The girls could have put more of an effort into their vocals. If this is for their fans, I don't think they are showing it very well."
3,"Okay, but a little disappointing","I think the first half of this CD was pretty good (with the exclusion of 'No Scrubs', which I got sick of pretty quickly), but the second half is filled with a lot of slow songs, which gets a little tiring. As mentioned by others on this board, the vocal range is pretty limited on the album and so is the lyrical content. How long do you want to hear about 'hos' and how someone wants to get in to bed with someone? How about something innovative? I prefer 'CrazySexyCool', which covered a wider range of topics, but if you don't mind buying an album for a few songs, then this isn't so bad."
1,This CD is a piece of garbage!,"I hate to diss TLC like this because I do think that in all they are good. However, their new cd fanmail is definately worth your money! There are only a few good songs and after a while No Scrubs gets annoying, and it's the only really good song in the album. Listen to this review and go get yourself another cd... as for this one... LEAVE IT ON THE SHELF!"
4,What a change!,"I have listened to TLC since they first emerged, but never have I heard them explore so many different sounds and tones in their music. Not many groups attempt this, but TLC had the guts to and it sounds great!"
3,Pretty good.,"Fan mail was OK, but I think it could have been a lot better. The only good tracks are #'s 1-9. T-boz really has no meaning. Left eye can rap bomb, and chilly can sing. T-boz can't do either. She is the one that makes some of the songs sound bad. She still my girl though!"
4,"Them my GYRLS, all of their albums are straight !","TLC, portray how some friends should be, everyone of their songs is like something they have experience. I like them because they are not rapping nasty, or negative Lyrics. They seem to be down to earth, I would not knock them if they were not my favorite, but I hope they keep up the good work, and I pray they NEVER split up, good female groups are so hard to find, We all Know it's alot out there trying to copy Yall NOT! that is M'Possible. Just ignore the Playa Haters, and a word from the Wise, Your Music is OFF THE CHAIN'! Baller B'."
5,THIS is woman power,"How I wish we Brits could turn out brilliant female groups like this instead of the drivel of Spice Girls, All Saints etc. Absolutely excellent, the lyrics are powerful and meaningful and yet not submissive. Excellent."
5,This is the bomb CD,This CD is tight. I have always been a TLC fan since 1992 when they came out with oohhhh on the TLC tip. TLC has been so successful so if you ever get to read this keep on doing what yall are doing and I promise you'll be on the markets for a long time.
4,ONE OF THE BEST C.D'S I HAVE!,"I BOUGHT THIS C.D FOR ONLY ""UNPRETTY"" AND ""SCRUBS"" BUT THEN WHEN I LISTENED TO THE C.D I THOUGHT THIS IS THE BEST C.D! IF YOU LIKE HIP-HOP AND T.LC'S MUSIC THEN THIS IS THE C.D FOR YOU! THEY ARE REALLY GOOD SINGERS!"
5,TLC - What a comeback!,"I got Fanmail on the strength of hearing No Scrubs, and Unpretty, I'm usually a fan of rock music, but like hiphop as well. The album contains some fantastic hooklines, great singing, brilliant grooves, and catchy songs. Stadnout tracks: Dear Lie, No Scrubs, Unpretty, I'm Good At Being Bad, Silly Ho, Fanmail. I also love the interludes - 'Whispering Playa' is very funny! I expected some good songs, but others pretty weak. I was mistaken - there aren't any weak tracks. I would reccomend the album to anyone who likes hiphop/soul music - this is a classic album!"
5,Great CD!.,"I think this CD is great. one of the best works for TLC so far. one of my favorite female Rap group around. ""Scrubbs is one of my favorite songs on this CD!."
3,how did all three get together,would yowl like me to write to you chilli you have very pretty voice all of you did good on that song scrub. good job
3,The writting of this album was horrible. 3 stars for music.,"The tracks for this Album for the most part were descent. No Scrubs is one of the tightest beats of the year, but the writting of that particular song and most of the songs ont the album were horrible. Like some kid wrote the lyrics or somehting. I was definitely expecting alot more from these ladies. This album as well as most of the music coming out these days does not show a hint of love put into it. I understand TLCs' crossover appeal and I wish them the best of luck but if you're not into it, you shouldn't do it. I know somebody's going to read this and think I'm crazy because everyone seems to love this CD. I don't know why though. They need to go back to the lab and have Jermaine Dupri do the whole album."
5,These are the girls that can't be stopped!,"I really love these girls! Ever since the release of ""Ooohhh..."" I knew that they were da bomb. I have been waiting for five long years for this release. I can not wait until it hits stores! ""Silly Ho,"" and ""No Scrubs,"" just wets the palate for what is to come from that album. I believe that they will rule the pop charts again with the ""Fan Mail"" album. Such sultry hits like ""Don't Pull Out On Me Yet,"" ""My Life,"" and ""Dear Lie,"" are bound to make all of pop America and the world want this album. Please go out and get it on February 23. Make this a multi-platinum album, just like their previous ones! If you are a TLC fan like myself, e-mail me at: chauncmanhere4u@hotmail.com"
4,Better than expected,"I bought this when it first came out and at first I was a little disappointed because I loved every sing off of crazy, sexy cool but this has grown on me and I recommend it highly"
4,All-round all-fun!,"TLC does a great job on this CD. The beat really picks me up and is awesome to dance to! Their lyrics are alittle on the inappropriate side sometimes, but beside that-awesome!"
3,Whatever,"Well I have to say this album is o.k but not the greatest. I loved CrazySexyCool but Fanmail doesn't compare to that. I really like I Miss You So Much, Unpretty, and If They Knew."
3,Just a notch above mediocrity,"Although I didn't particularly care for the slow songs, the fast ones should catch on. I give them credit for making a different-sounding album, but the interludes with that computer (or whatever it is) is kinda annoying. For die-hard TLC fans. Everybody else: buy at your own risk!"
5,"The hottest and most coolest ALBUM,ever heard!!!!","This album was terrific. I actually did not regret buying this album,like I did with Lauryn Hill. TLC never dies,they'll just keep on going. They'll just keep on being the best and nobody would compete with them,actually they can't be or compete with TLC....... THE BEST!!!!!"
4,"VULGAR, YET VERY TALENTED AND VERY BLESSED.","AT TIMES THIS CD, CAN BE INSULTING(SILLY-HO), AND AT OTHER TIMES YOU CAN TELL THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE TALENTD AND , VERY BLESSED.THE MOST INSULTING SONGS THST THEY HAVE RECORDED(SILLY-HO, NO SCRUBS) SHOULD TEACH THEM A LESSON ABOUT PEOPLE AND LIFE. THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ONLY DO SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE IN CONDOMS THEY ALSO BELIEVE IN GOD. NOT TO CRAMP THEIR STYLE."
2,Would you buy this?,"Well, the quality is good, the advertisment is strong but I spent almost an hour listening to this at Tower Records and have a very simple thing to say: scrap sold to fools who don't know anything about real beats and hard work in creativity. But the quality of the sound is good, but not great."
3,TIRESOME BUT CATCHY,Listening to FAN MAIL by itself is a chore. All the songs seem the same and I personally felt that I was experiencing deja vu. TLC has done better. CrazySexyCool was their finest album by far.
3,THESE GIRLS ARE PIGEONS,THESE GIRLS SHOULD TAKE A LESSON FROM SPORTY THIEVZ AND LEARN TO MAKE FUNNY SONGS.SHUT UP ALL OF YOU ARE PIGEONS HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
4,Well Worth Your $$$$,"I don't listen to a lot of hip-hop, but this CD is da bomb! There is one song that should be skipped (I Miss You So Much), but otherwise the CD is great- great beat, great lyrics. My faves are If They Knew, Unpretty, and to dance to Silly Ho."
5,"A SEXY, INNOVATIVE THIRD ALBUM!","When TLC released their second album in '94, I knew they weren't finished. But the ladies have kept us waiting a good five years for this album. ""Silly Ho"" is a slammin' song with a catchy and soulful beat. TLC is definitely going places."
3,"Good album, but felt unplanned","You know how an album has a flow to it? This album has no flow. It seems as if the tracks were layed down without a plan.I was upset because this album felt commercialized and fake. I missed the rawness of original TLC work.I'm torn, it isn't an artists fault when they want to expand their horizons and push their talent to the limit. Just seems like something was missing on this album. I've owned it for a long time now, I can't believe I'm just getting around to review it now :)Otherwise, it is a MUST HAVE for any TLC fan, for sure!"
2,WHO'S A SCRUB NOW? Fanmail - A Major Disappointment,"After two hot albums from T-Boz, Left Eye, and Chilli and over ten million album sales, the third album from TLC was destined to be a classic. Right? Sorry scrubs, try again. This album has FIVE really good songs out of about 14. Silly Ho, No Scrubs, Miss You So Much, Unpretty, and Track#6. So why did I only give the album two stars? Because the rest of the album is at best mediocre. The songs are either lackluster or very repetitive. The production on much of the album is weak like Canibus' first joint. The album tries gain appeal by hving a futuristic theme, but it simply doesn't work. The 'futuristic' sound may be popular 10 or 20 years from now, but today it's simply not good enough. I just hope this disappointing album doesn't spell the end of the line for such a talented trio. But reality is, these women need to rush back to the studio before it's too late to save their once high-flying careers."
4,Catchy Song,"I'm not a huge fan of TLC, but this song has a great hook, I find myself humming it a lot. I've previewed the rest of the album and I may buy it in the future but I'm not breaking my neck to do so right now."
3,I THINK THE FANMAIL CD HAS ONLY TWO SONGS THAT ARE GREAT,"I THINK THE HAVE CAME OUT THIS BETTER THAN ANY YEAR BEFORE, BUT THERE ARE ONLY TWO SONGS ON THIS LP THAT I REALLY LIKE, AND THOSE ARE ""SILLY HOE"" AND NO SCRUBS."
1,A waste of my precious time.,"I strongly dislike the song, ""No Scrubs"" by TLC. It makes the people from generation x seem like they are shallow and materialistic. Also the song is too repetative and they could have put a little more time into writing it. A 13 year- old could've written a better song than that."
1,You've got to be kidding.,You've really got to be kidding. How does something like this get to be numero uno? Just proves what the world is comming to.
3,It's okay,"There is only on esong i like on it, so it's acually a waste of money. I should have got the single CD."
1,Don't waste your $$$$,"This CD is nothing like their first and second CD's. I know that everybody will want it because they heard ""Silly HO"" and ""No Scrubs"" and they thought they were tight, but those are the only good tracks on the entire album. I have bought the two previous CDs and judging by them I thought this was going to top them all, but I was definetly wrong. They must have just thrown this together to get some money. Please, don't waste your $$$!"
2,A Disappointment After Crazy Sexy Cool,"I was disappointed by this CD - although some of the tracks are good, it isn't as good as their previous CD. And T-Boz, what's up with the red/orange hair? You are too beautiful for that! I wouldn't recommend it - if you want to hear TLC at their best, buy Crazy Sexy Cool."
4,luved it except 4 1 thing,"i really luved this album, except i think they should really have more of Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes in the songz"
4,THEY KNEW WHAT THEY HAD TO DO!!,TLC went into this project with high expectations giving their fans glorification for their great success. This part is more true than most... without their fans where would they be. They'd have no money and no job...but see they do have fans so what can I say they knew what they had to do this time and they did it..
5,TLC IS THE BOMB,"YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,THIS ALBUM IS BETTER THAN THEIR LAST ONE. I GIVE THEM MAJOR PROPS FOR THEIR SONGS,""NO SCRUBS"" AND ""SILLY HO"".WELCOME BACK GIRLFRIENDS!!!!"
4,I love TLC!,"This album is pretty good. My favorite songs are ""Silly Ho"", ""Dear Lie"" and ""I Don't Know"". ""No Scrubs"" is cool but they're playing it too much on the radio these days! You really get to hear Chilli's voice more on this album, especially in ""Dear Lie"". They're so cool & they're good role models for today's young women. Be independent, have safe sex, don't take sh** from any guy!"
4,this cd has a song for every mood!,"Ok, first I would just like to say to the music fan from New York, TLC does not sing about nursery rhymes and they do not have immature voices either. Personally I don't see why you have the criticize the group so much... you probably couldn't do any better... Anyway, back to the cd. Although I'm not a huge fan of TLC, I must say that they have matured a lot between this cd and their last. The lyrics are powerful (not nursery rhymes) and songs such as ""Dear Lie"" and ""Unpretty"" have inspired me, and probably others too. I think that this cd can be enjoyable to anyone who likes R&B or rap... (because this cd has a little of both) However, for the people out there who have to ruin the cd by criticizing every part of it should have never listened to it in the first place! If you can't enjoy something for what it is, and you know you don't like that genre of music, then I have some advice for you... don't buy the cd!"
2,This album does not contain TLC's best work,This album contains two good songs and the rest are not very good
4,"The CD is really good, especially ""No Scrubs""","I am not too impressed 'bout all the songs. Overall though, its cool, and I 'll recommend it!"
3,Uhhh....Not as good as their last ones,The album has a few BOMB songs. The rest are aiight. I think TLC's first album was the best.
3,"TLC's Fanmail was a dissapointment compare to Crazy,Sexy,Coo","TLC's new album was good, but compared to Crazy,Sexy,Cool, it was nothing! I know artists like to change their image and take new direction on different projects, but on this album after the fifth song I was falling asleep. I just wasn't feeling this album as much as Crazy,Sexy,Cool, alot of the lyrics didn't make since along with the words. Also I think they need to let Chilli do most of the singing, because TBoz really can't sing all that great, she just has a unusal voice for a woman."
5,TLC is back on the charts- KICKIN ASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"As most of us know, TLC has been together ever since like 1992. I think it is amazing that they have not gone stale over the past 7 years. GOOD LUCK IN THE FUTURE TLC!!!!!! (Even though you girls don't need any since you have became bigstars)!!!!!!"
5,Unpretty is the BEST song in the world.,"I definitly request this cd it is da BOMB. My personal favorite it Unpretty, it set a good example for girls that if your boyfriend can't accept you for who you are they are not worth it. But I enjoy the whole cd well gotz to go. Bye!!!!!!!!"
4,Good,"I didn't know what to expect from this cd at first. But it is pretty good. There are a lot more slow song than previous albums, and I don't really know what I think about them yet. Overall the cd is good so far."
4,"The new TLC CD is ""a strong show of perserverance""!","The ladies have really done a pretty good job proving that they have what it takes to exist in ""the business"". Their sound is unique and their new look is complimentary. Also, dedicating the album to their fans was a wise decision. I wish them well. --KK"
4,sounds good...,"no scrubs is my favorite on the kube. makes me smile everytime I hear it. very plain and rather funny. the melody is good. however, everlasting. once you hear it it's going to stay with you for the rest of the day... I like it."
4,I am feeling the lyrics to No Scrubs!,"I haven't heard the entire CD, but I am feeling the lyrics to No Scrubs. TLC seems to have matured lyrically.."
4,LEFT EYE'S LAST CD,THIS CD WAS GOOD. IF YOU WERE OR ARE A TLC FAN U LIKED IT. NOT AS GREAT AS CRAZYSEXYCOOL. BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY GOOD SONGS ON THIS CD:NO SCUBSSILLY HOUNPRETTYMY LIFESHOUTDEAR LIECOME DOWNMISS U SO MUCHTHIS CD IS A LITTLE MORE EDGE TO IT. BUT STILL GOOD.
2,bad,"I'm sorry to say this, but TLC really let themselves down with this one. There is hardly any Left Eye, and most of the songs are just some standard R&B garbage (not to say I don't like some standard R&B garbage, but I'm expecting something a little different from TLC). It's nice that Chilli had some more lead singing, but most of the songs it seemed like hardly anyone from the group was there except the lead one singing. Basically, this CD is boring. That's the basic thing. Yes, No Scrubs and Unpretty are good, but really that's about all. Some, like Come On Down, are sort of pretty to listen to for a while, but they are not enough to hold the whole thing up. TLC's first two albums were awesome, and I can't help but agree with Left Eye's disagreements with the group. They started out great, so wwhy did they want to regress to mediocre? They don't even sound like a group anymore on this CD. I hope they get it together better next time. Well, that's it for this diatribe. Buy something else though."
1,TLC blows because they are a bunch of pigeons,Well i guess no scrub song is ok but no pigeons is the bomb
4,Scrubs,"This song is so true,I can really relate to the words,I always have some SCRUB trying to pick me up,so thanks TLC now i just play them the song. KEEP UP THE FUNK."
2,I HEARD NO SCRUBS & JUST NEEDED THE ALBUM. ONLY 2 GD TRAX,"no scrubs is an absolutely HEAVY song of soul, r & b and a touch of hip pop. Its perfect & 1 of my fave songs 2 date. But im sorry 2 say Unpretty & No Scrubs are the only amazing trax. Dear Lie & I Miss U So Much r ok, but the rest are $hiT im disapointed & woulda given the album 1 star if it werent 4 the amazing No Scrubs & Unpretty... BUY ALICIA KEYS OR LAURYN HILL INSTEAD!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I really liked ""Crazy, Sexy, Cool"" and bought this cd immediately. WOW, it was like night and day. I don't know what happened, but this album is not worth [the cost]."
3,"Good, but too many boring songs","I think TLC deserve a lot of credit. They could have played it very safe with this CD and made a ton of money. Instead, they clearly wanted to take some chances with their music and explore some new styles. T-Boz's songs ""Unpretty"" and ""Dear Lie"" are great!!! Chili has a very appealing voice and it makes ""No Scrubs"" cool. Despite this, a lot of the songs on FanMail are just plain dull! ""I'm Good At Being Bad"" and ""Shout"" are the only energetic songs on the CD. The rest are slow jams, if that. By track 9, I was getting sleepy. I kept skipping to the next track because I was getting bored. The songs just lack energy! There needs to be more rapping from Left-Eye to liven things up. FanMail is an okay CD and it proves that TLC wants to grow musically. Maybe their next CD will have better songs to showcase this."
5,Tlc Returns,"Fanmail is totally awesome. It's a great comeback for tlc and my fave songs are 'No Scrubs', 'Silly ho','dear lie' and most the others had a nice dance beat. i'd definitely recommend it......."
3,There is some hope for these Three Lame Chicks afterall.,"It was once said that TLC was the female Bell Biv Devoe. Well it is unfortunate that their male equivalent is no longer in business.These ladies actually have some good offerings, if only they would just grow up. Off of all their cds they have had really great songs. This one is no exception. I really liked Dear Lie and Unpretty. I would really like to see some of their other more mature mature material get promoted as well as their immature No Scrubs did."
1,It's not worth the hologram in the cover,"I was just taking a look at some of the reviews people have been giving this album and I thought it would be important to let you know that there's some serious opposition out there. I was a die-hard TLC fan since their first album and I stuck with them even through their condom fashion stage. I was extremely impressed with the production, lyrics, and thought that was put into the second album, Crazy, Sexy, Cool, but I'm sorry to say that Fan Mail is seriously disappointing. The lyrics suck, the interludes are utterly cheesball and were put there just so the album appears to have more tracks, and the only good songs, Silly Hoe and No Scrubs play so much on that radio and in clubs that you're sick of hearing them by the time you pop in the cd. Sorry TLC, but if I could take back your new album for a refund I would. Borrow this one from someone if you're a hardcore TLC fan, then think about buying it."
2,"sorry,but this cd is a huge disappointment........","I've heard all of the songs on Ooooohh...On the TLC Tip, their first album, which was excellent. Then came CrazySexyCool, a great follow-up. And now,this.... Is it the swearing? No,it's not the swearing... Some people are shocked and appalled to hear such a ""fine music group"" swear. I ,personally, don't care about the swearing as much as i care about the bad music... Yes,this is bad music,very bad music indeed. What happened to songs like ""Baby,Baby,Baby"",""Creep"", ""Case of the Fake People"", ""Waterfalls"" and ""Shock Dat Monkey?"" No one really knows. Well,I do. They've been replaced by trashy tracks such as ""No Scrubs"" and ""Silly Ho"" This CD is a huge waste of money. The only worthwhile tune here on ""Fanmail"" is the meaningful ""Unpretty"", possibly the only reason why I gave this horrible CD two stars instead of one."
1,ACTUALLY - A ZERO STAR RATING,"""Silly Ho"" Wow, now that's a deep subject! Does this MTV featured trio have any brains? They're definitely wealthy. It amazes me how the rap industry and MTV (Viacom) has brainwashed America into thinking that rap or a good video is music. TLC is definitely not music."
3,OK but i know TLC could have did better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THERE FIRST TWO CD'S WAS THE BOMD.WITH THIS ONE IT SEEMED LIKE THEY JUST RUSHED THOUGH IT TO GET BACK ON THE MAP.IT WAS NOT A WASTE OF $$$$$ BUT IT ALSO WAS.TLC KEEP UP YOUR ""GOOD""WORK AND FIND A NEW WAY OF REINTRODUCING YOUR SELF.GO BACK TO YOUR OLD STYLE AND TRY AGAIN!!!!!!!"
5,Verrrrrrry Good :),I loved this cd! It is the best one I have! I couln't have spent my money on anything better! I give it 2 thumbs up also!
3,i've never heard y'all curse so much,i love yall to death but damn yall are the inspiration that most girls need to today.the cursing was cool because yall showed yall weren't just goodie girls.luv ya
5,Brimming with appeal!!!,"TLC are still top and this cd proves it! For all the fans who waited through the 5 year absence and wondered whether the group could do it again, i say a big YES!!!! ""FanMail"" picks up where its predecessor left us - it still has banging beats and smoooth harmonies oozing style to the fullest! These girls do not have to worry about disappointing the fans, because ""FanMail"" has delivered the goods big-time. Highlight tracks are: - ""I'm Good At Being Bad"", ""No Scrubs"", ""Silly Ho"", ""If They Knew"" and the intriguing upcoming single ""Unpretty"". All songs on this album keep you wanting more!! I recommend all lovers of the group and the genre buy it!!!! Album of the year most definately!!!"
3,I feel Cheated,"I loved the CD musically. I went for the safer edited version so that I could play it wherever I wanted to without offending anyone. Still I have to say I feel cheated. I bought the CD basically for No Scrubs and the deciding factor was Lisa's rap. Unfortunately Lisa's rap was not on the CD version. I thought maybe it was on the explicit CD, but from reading the Reviews it isn't there either. While I do love the rest of the CD I feel like No Scrubs is missing something w/out the rap. I'll be sure to more carefully consider further purchases from the group."
4,THE CD WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY,I THINK THE CD WAS A GREAT ONE. I THINK THE CD WAS WORTH THE WAIT. I AM GLAD TLC RECORDED BOTH SONGS WITH FAST AND SLOW BEATS. THE CD IS ONE THAT YOU CAN DANCE TO OR JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX. I DEFINITELY HAVE MY FAVORITES SONGS. I CAN ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THE WHOLE CD WITHOUT FAST FORWARDING THROUGH ANY SONGS.
5,Ahead of its time,"When I first bought this album in 1999, it didn't sound like anything else out there. Listening to it today, what's most striking is that it now sounds like something you could hear at almost any time on the radio. I mean that as a compliment. TLC proved with this album that they didn't follow trends, they created them. It's a shame they can never make music anymore, but they did leave behind impressive albums, like this one. ""No Scrubs"" didn't sound like anything on radio at the time; now it's almost impossible to not find a ripoff of that song on the radio. ""Unpretty"" was surprisingly inspiring and another huge hit for the trio. My favorite song is probably ""I'm Good at Being Bad"" simply because it is nasty and completely tuneful at the same time.This is an outstanding album that was ahead of the curve. It sounds like it could have been made today, and it is that very thing that will ensure that TLC's legacy will never be forgotten."
5,Brilliant!,"At the time, no one has ever made album like this! They DID forge new ground with this CD TLC are definitely the trendsetters."
5,R.I.P LEFT EYE,"I just found out about Left Eye(Lisa Lopes) this morning.At first I didn't believe it BUT after seeing the very real statements from L.A Reid,T-Boz,and Chili on VH1's ""Morning Start"".I can't believe that Ms. Crazy Left Eye passed away.She will be missed.I now listen to ""FanMail""-TLC's last release together-with sorrow.The falmboyant Left Eye is no longer with us.But she is surely in a better place.R.I.P Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes(1971-2002)"
5,THIS C.D IS THE BOMB!!,I think that their album Fanmail was much better than Crazy Sexy Cool. It has a lot of good lyrics and my favorite song from the cd is No Scrubs. If you like rap music and you like the rhythm of this cd you should definitly get this Cd.
3,Fanmail,"I think that this new song ""Scrubs"" is really one of eveybody's favorites. I would buy this CD if I liked the rest of the other songs....I haven't heard any of the others!!!!"
2,worse than last album 'crazysexycool',"It has been the best album in this year until SUEDE have released their latest album--HEADMUSIC.Now,they(TLC) are second."
1,A CD DEFINITLY WORTH NOTHING,THIS CD WAS HORRIBLE THIS BUNCH OF SCRUBS SHOULD KEEP CHASING WATERFALL
4,its dedicated to the fans,"this was once my favorite tlc album(now its 3d). the girls were so creative on this one and it was dedicated to the fans.though i wish left eye was used more on this album,not that it upsets me,but we never got a chance to really know her(well all we know was she was crazy),but like t-boz said,it's a figure of speech.most of the tracks are boring but those that make up this album would be:SILLY HONO SCRUBSIM GOOD AT BEING BADI MISS YOU SO MUCHMY LIFE-WHICH IS MY FAVORITE ON THIS ENTIRE ALBUMDEAR LIELOVESICK"
4,Providing Role models and motivation,"TLC's Fanmail is filled with motivation for young women. The best example being ""Unpretty"". It gives motivation and confidence to young women and makes them look deeper to find internal beauty. The majority of the songs talk about female independence and gives females the courage to go solo, implying that they do not need men to make them whole. The hit single ""No Scrubs"" gives women a power boost. In the song ""My Life"", TLC sings about the freedom to make your own choices, even if it means making mistakes as well. This CD has everything from dance music such as hip-hop to slow ballads that shows off their singing skills. Even though none of their songs are as good as ""Waterfalls"", they give you a good message with a nice beat. This CD is filled with postive messages and encouragement. I definitely recommend this CD."
5,they've grown,"TLC has since been a group based on sex, women's rights, and more sex...I have found that through all their cd's there has been a leel of materilization that they now comprehend that they have a deeper meaning, and that they as women and african american women are important, and deserve respect. With song's like ""dear Lie"" I see it as a coming of age song, where which ever ones wrote it knew it was time to give up the childish games, and move on. I give big up 's and MUCH RESPECT to TLC on this and all thier other albums~"
2,BORING,This album is boring and the worst album tlc have ever released. I expect better work on an album especially the thrid one. Waste of time and money.
5,TLC Totally Living Coolness!,"I LOVE! This CD it has great songs and great music I enjoy No Scrubs,and UnPretty, those are my favorites but all the songs are cool in there own special way I think that people should buy this CD cause it is great like I said Totally Living Coolness Keep it up TLC!"
4,"Dynamic Vocals, Versitile.","I think that TLC really has something going with them. Although not quite as good as their sophomore albumn,""CrazySexyCool"" they are heading for a Y2k sound that is taking them back to platinum status. ""Unpretty"" is a very inspirational song, as well as their other ""anthems"" i.e. ""No Scrubs"" ""Silly H*"", and ""I'm Good at Being Bad"". As for people who claim that TLC isn't music, they must be, as they are multi-platinum artists, don't be jealous and say that they aren't music, you probably are the main ones buying their records."
2,I was dissappinted!!,"I used to be a tlc freak back in my younger days I bought this album without hestitation, which I have now lived to regret. I really liked Fanmail which I think is the best song on the album and If they new. The remix of Unpretty is so much better the rest of the album is boring."
4,better than crazysexycool!,I thought that this album was really good except some of the songs dragged on for a bit. My favourite songs had to be unpretty no scrubs and my life but i also liked so good at being bad. definately buy it if u haven't already! got to go love ME!
5,"The ""self-discovery"" in the title also refers to yourself...","Whether you are a parent or someone's child, you will see yourself in it - perhaps more clearly than if the book had been directly about you."
4,Hello Kitty Unbrella,"This is a very pretty umbrella, so girlie! It does not fold up or collapse into a smaller size like a Totes umbrella. It folds down nicely enough but is still long and old-fashioned like. It opens up fairly big - just right for a 5 year old girl to carry and keep dry under in a rainstorm. We haven't yet gotten to try it out in the rain, but the quality of the fabric is pretty good, and I doubt the colors will bleed when wet. If it does I will certainly update this review. I think it's worth what we paid for it and my 5 year old was really very happy Santa had left it for her under the tree. It was the first thing she went for."
4,"Bad trailer, good movie","Surprisingly strong performance by Maya Rudolph, well-written, and a strong movie overall.DVD transfer is also pretty good, though I feel the sound could be a tad better. Nothing that isn't solved by cranking the volume up."
4,Authentically amusing,"So much of what passes for romantic comedy contains not one iota of humor. However, this little piece of work is an exception. The two central characters are not that funny, but the cast of relatives they meet on the road while they check out potential places to move to are indeed kind of a laugh. Though each of these other couples are stereotypes, they are still pretty well done. The New Age couple I found to be the funniest, right down to the Zen details in their university-ish Victorian abode. The Arizona pair were also good, the wife bipolar and the husband alcoholic. Least amusing were the Montreal people, though they were the least exaggerated. Miami is barely portrayed, and I don't know where the family home was supposed to be located because it sure didn't look like any piece of Miami I know and I once lived there. This is well worth your time."
4,Finding a place called Home.,"""Away We Go"" is directed by Sam Mendes and stars John Krasinski (Bert) and Maya Rudolph (Verona). Early in the film we meet Bert's parents (Catherine O'Hara, and Jeff Daniels) who seem anxious to leave for Europe on a two year leave just a month before Verona is to give birth. This sets Bert and Verona off to thinking that maybe they should move somewhere different and start a new life themselves. So off they go, first to Phoenix, then Tucson, and up to Montreal before eventually landing in Miami. This journey takes them on a comical tour of their past as they meet old friends or family members whom they haven't seen for years. But the road trip doesn't end there as no place has yet seemed like home so off they go again.This film has a wonderfully disarming quality about it, and is spiked with a playful sense of humor. Bert and Verona are just two very normal and real people who are trying to find their place in life. Go on a journey with them..."
2,"Cute, but tedious","The story of two people on a journey to find their home is poignant and familiar to most of us - we've all looked for a home at one time. The lead characters give viewers an interesting take on this search, but the remaining ones are exaggerated and uninteresting stereotypes (far-out college professor, loud-mouth redneck, etc.) who contribute nothing original to the story. Overall the movie is just tedious and I found myself hoping that it would end sooner rather than later."
4,Some indie-related irritations but a good story,"As is common in many indie films, there is too much music in the soundtrack, to the point that it almost drowns out the dialogue at times. Also, there's no good reason for some of the profanity--not that I am prudish, but it feels lazy to me when writers resort to profanity for no particular reason.Otherwise, Rudolph and Krasinski do a fine job as a young couple, Verona and Burt, who at least have the sense to realize that they are imperfect. The other couples they visit are not as cognizant of their own flaws, especially the annoying and cloying yet somehow superior/contemptuous LN (a superb Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her husband. No matter where the couple goes, they can never quite find a place that feels like home until the end, when they go back to a place that Verona has not seen in many years.Director Mendes does much better work here than he did with Revolutionary Road."
5,"Wonderful, feel good movie","I loved this movie. My husband and I were expecting our first child when we watched this, and our situation was very similar to the characters. We found the movie to be hilarious and yet thoughtful. I recommend this to anyone, not just those who are having babies. It's truly a feel good movie you can watch over and over."
4,Good movie,"The DVD holder inside the case was broken so the DVD doesnt stay in place, otherwise it was a good purchase"
5,Magnificent,"Away We Go is hilarious - its deft situational humor had me gasping for air between my bouts of laughter. This movie offers wonderful and wholesome insights into the ethereal quality of life. Also, the soundtrack is entrancingly beautiful, and harmonizes with the movie perfectly."
2,Overrated movie.,"Rented this flick recently. I think the critics liked it, but I just didn't get it. Bored in the first 30 minutes, never recovered. Maybe I'm just too shallow to get it. Lol."
2,A serious down-grade...,Not even two percent of what American Beauty was. Just goes to show you how important the script is. And someone on hereactually said this movie was believable? Almost none of the minor characters were believable at all.
4,"Charming, real and funny!","Loved it! The acting was awesome... especially Alisson Janney, who practically stole the show, in my opinion! So cleverly written, brilliantly acted and with a musical score that was perfect for the film. Great flick for people who have the stillness and emotional maturity to tolerate a film that's mostly dialogue with no explosions or car chases!"
2,Stay away...you've been warned,"We rented this based on the positive reviews...i wish i had more energy to give this a thorough review. there are some decent parts in the movie, but there are so many cliches and John is basically playing his Office character with a disguise on....its gets very boring and tiresome. Not worth your time."
5,Great movie.,"Missed this one at the flicks, nice bitter sweet romantic comedy about finding your place with your new baby, good stuff."
1,save your money,"Away We Go is just depressing! I expected to like it, I wanted to like it but this flawed, lonely couple and the obnoxious families and friends they meet along their journey left me in a major funk!"
2,Away We G ... PLEASE GO AWAY!,"A preposterous film that isn't funny at all. A very strange set of characters chasing, well, who knows what. It tries to hard to be quirky and to emulate the ""Juno"" soundtrack with its acoustic indie rock background score.It didn't score with me.I think I'd rather have my teeth drilled without Novocaine than to have to watch this boring flop of a movie again."
1,Away We Go DVD In The Trash,"I'm sorry...I really looked forward to seeing this flick with Jon Krasinski, my personal favorite from The Office, but from the start it was lewd, rude and crude. Cut right to Jim Gaffigan who really can get me laughing got me totally depressed as the husband with no cajones. Maybe it got better after half way through, but for me it wasn't worth the wait. Like I say, So Many Movies, So Little Time."
3,As mentioned previously...,"As mentioned by the previous reviewer, while the narration is top-notch and very accurate, the same clips are used multiple times for very different events. The reason I gave it three stars as opposed to the previous reviewers two, is because despite having the same clips repeatedly, it does do the job of presenting the battles and major events of the Second World War in a comprehensive and accurate manner. The images are good for something to look at, but the talking is where you learn about the war. It's basically a set of really good lectures that the professor decided to record and stick some images on. Never heard of that happening, but I think that's what it would look like. Worth it for the audio."
3,things to do in denver when you're dead,"this collection takes you in many directions, some are excellent and might even improve your life..."
4,Classic Punk from the band from Vancouver (Not the UK),"Peopel who expect this album to be from Dick and the UK based Subhumans will be disappointed. It is classic anarchist punk from the Canadian Subhumans.Lyrics are simple and highly politisized. It is angry, some times funny, and very good.The band included Gerry Hannah, famous as one of the Squamish Five (eco-terrorists who blew up part of a cruise missle factory and part of an unenvironmental hydroelectric plant). Memebers also went on to form DOA.For anyone who thought there was only one classic band named the Subhumans, this album lets you peer into early Canadian punk at its best."
3,good album by the subhumans,"this comilation came out in 1996 from Virgin Music Canada.TheSubhumans lps and singles are long out of print including this one now.It is fairly consistent but doesnt hold up to Incorrect Thoughts, or even the 12 inch from 1979, and the single Firing Squad.Their last album No wishes No Prayers is okay too-that lprelaesed in 1983 by SST RECORDS..I like most of the early songs.I'm still waiting for Joe Keithley and Brian Goble to re-releaseall the SUBHUMANS STUFF ON jOE'S LABEL-sUDDEN dEATH rECORDS.kUDOS GO OUT TO JOE FOR RE-RELEASING DOA'S HARDCORE '81 AND SOMETHING BETTER CHANGE AND THE LOST TAPES ALL THOSE CDS ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ANY SERIOUS FAN OF 1980S CANADIAN PUNK."
2,They must have been on sedatives.,"This reminds me of how the DeadMilkmen became some mellowed out post-punk band. When I first heard this album, I thought that some new band had formed under this great bands name, it sounds nothing like what they have sounded like. If you like the album ""From the Cradle to the Grave"" or ""Worlds Apart"", then save your money and don't buy this. Wait till your friend buys this album and then listen to it. I sold my album back to the music store, that's how usless it was. Of course if you are looking to spend your money on trash, or if need a new ashtray, then I highly recommend it."
1,"Not from England, but from Vancouver",This is an album from the Vancouver group Sub Humans and NOT the great Subhumans from England.
5,Hope you're not expecting regular badman material!,"From the opening question, 'Is there anyone out there?', I was instantly captivated by this album. Perfect for long-time listening, with a steady and rhythmic beat throughout, this is ideal for long and lonely journeys. On a day like today, should introduce more listeners to this artist's music, as Waking up the Neighbours did in 1991. It was well worth the wait."
2,"Good, but...","This is Adams' least loved album, and only sold 3 million copies.However; it's still a great record, but a pop record - not a rock album with a few nice rock-ballads, like Adams' ""Waking Up The Neighbours"" or ""Into The Fire"". There is only one familiar Adams sounding rock song, ""Before The Night Is Over"", and the rest of the album is soft pop-rockers and alot of beautiful pop songs. So my advice is; buy it if you like great melodic simpel pop music, but not if you're expecting the old Adams sound! ""18 Til I DIe"" highlighted Adams' other rock/music styles, but this one is just way too soft - kindda boring, but nice."
3,no so good but mel c do it,when your gone is the best song in there 2 stars becuese mel c spice up your life!!!
4,ON A day like today bryam adams,"this is by far his most complete collection of pure music, since the mid 1980's. it is worth listening to all the songs on the cd again. no filler but pure music and soul. if you have been a fan for years, from his early days, you can tell he is getting fun again to listen to. may 2000 bring more of the same."
5,Another Awesome Arrangement by Bryan Adams!!!!!,"Bryan Adams continues to write and perform some of the best music around. The album is catchy right from the beginning, and he can bring out emotions better than anyone. His lyrics can reach right into your soul, and some songs you think were written specifically for you. Great CD - all the songs are addicting. Can't seem to stop playing it!! AWESOME!!!"
5,Definately different without Mutt Lange.,"Adams has written with Lange for about 8 years and has cranked out pop hits (4 albums to date I think)- albeit some were thanks to pop movies. Now on his own, he is back to orginal Adams talent. This album has style and quality. It evokes originallity and modern diversity while maintaining a pop rock centre piece. - Adams just gets better with age."
5,GRAB IT NOW!!!!,"This is one of those rare albums you can listen the whole way through without thinking of switching off. Lyrically, this is his best ever. It's not his usual rock-based stuff, but I think this album works best for him because it shows off his wonderful sore-throaty voice! For once I also did not have to wait for the singles to come out for me to appreciate this album, just the first listen at the record store. You'll be missing out if you don't grab this. Spice Girls fans there's also a duet with Melanie C. called When You're Gone which would also be released as a single."
5,Adams In True Form,"The CD might not be available yet, but the first single is. Entitled On A Day Like Today, the single gives great promise for the upcoming album. A nice mid-tempo rocker, with a very catchy tune, this single leaves this reviewer anticipating the upcoming album, which, among other things, will feature Cecile Thomsen (actress and Adams' girlfriend), as well as Mel C from Spice Girls performing alongside Adams."
5,Not just for actors - a great introduction to Shakespeare,"As a life-long fan of Shakespeare, I was intrigued by the idea of reading ""alternate"" monologues from Shakespeare. It did not disappoint, I was reminded of important, albeit smaller roles, paid attention to fantastic speeches that I'd hitherto missed and got a new view of plays that I previously only seen through the viewpoint of the main characters.I think this would be an excellent way to introduce people who are new to and/or reluctant about Shakespeare. A mother telling her son to lie in order to get power, a inn maid advising the ingenue to be careful of men trying to seduce her - so much that is applicable to our lives now, monologues short enough to not overwhelm and so on.Very highly recommended."
1,"Cute, but doesn't work in textured tubs!","I bought this for my daughter because she LOVES Dora, but our tub unit is slightly textured and none of the suction cups will stick! It floats up when you fill the tub which defeats the purpose of a non-slip mat!"
4,durable and my kids like it,"We did not have any problems with this mat. All the suction cups work fine in our tub. In addition, this mat is very durable we have it for couple of years now and looks like new. My kids always like to have it on the bath when they are taking a bath."
1,not the right one,"this is not the film that is received when ordered. i have ordered it twice and received a different one both times. instead of disc four you get collection 4. totally different episodes. a mistake by the manufacturer, but still a mistake."
5,Excellent look at early 20th century wilderness expeditions.,Patterson makes a 200 mile snowshoe trek in 50 below weather to pick up the mail seem like slightly unusual walk to the post office!
4,"Extreme conditions, related modestly","The Oxford educated author, Raymond Patterson, chucked his staid life as London banker for the extreme conditions of the 1920's Canadian far north, traversing barely navigable rivers and wintering in 40 below conditions far from the nearest supply post.The accounts are highly colourful, occasionally humorous and truly amazing as real life survivor accounts. Unlike some modern adventure story-telling, the author thankfully omits hyping the risks and achievements, avoids ominous foreshadowing and such devices, and relates his account in a modest but richly descriptive style."
3,Is this for dust?,"I bought this respirator exclusively for work in woodworking-dust. Unfortunately I relied on all the reviews. However, upon receiving the mask and the P100 filters, I do not see any mention of dust. Paint, pesticide sprays/vapors, muratic acid,lead abatement,asbesteos, and mold, but no mention of dust. Don't try and call AO Safety I tried until I gave up. Definitely, lousy customer support or maybe they are overwhelmed for customers wanting clarification? So if you are looking for something better than a regular dust mask, make sure this product is for dust. By the way, you can see this product and filters at Home Depot paint dept. They have other filters but none for dust."
4,Worth every penny,"Fits great around my face. I use it for cleaning with chlorine and other chemical cleaning fluids. Works great, can't smell a thing. As an asthmatic, I was breathing a bit harder about 15 minutes but to save my lungs from harsh chemicals, I'll still highly recommend it."
4,good price,"I purchased this Respirator for occasional use in shop. It works well and achieves an excellent seal even with a goatee I had no problems. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is the face piece rubber/plastic feels cheaper than I expected. Time will tell if that becomes an issue as it hasn't thus far. Then again for the price you wont find one better, I've had several and this 1 is tops for the price. Do like the drop-down latch which takes it off your face 1 handed for short breaks. [...]"
5,Great Respirator,I bought this respirator to put on some willbond paint stripper and it worked great. There was no odor and the mask fit very well too. The quick latch system is really nice as well.
5,"Keeps vapors out, quick release is awesome.","I was staining some wood and getting sick doing it. Once I started wearing this thing, I couldn't even smell the paint anymore, even with my face practically in the bucket (I was running my own tests!). It is quite comfortable, and the quick release latch makes it so I can easily be free of it and breathe fresh air if I ever have a few minutes to do so, without taking the whole thing off. I really appreciate that feature. I'm glad I bought this."
5,The best respirator out there,This is a very comfortable respirator with easy on - off features. I am allergic to latex. This is latex free. I paid $30 for this on Amazon. This is the best price out there. I wear one of these 40 hours per week due to allergies and the type of materials I am exposed to in my work. Look no further.
1,hard to find replacment cartridges,"The mask works great! Loved it. However, replacement cartridges are unavailable. Do a quick search before you purchase. When it came time to buy my first set of new filters they were unavailable from top sellers like amazon.com and grainger. Can't find them anywhere rendering this mask as a waste of money"
3,Educate yourself before buying,"There is a little more to buying/using a respirator that you need to consider. First - chose the correct size/fit. That's hard to do over the net. Second be clean shaven - beards render the face mask/fit useless. Three - make sure you use the correct cartridge for the contaminant you are protecting yourself from. Four - clean and store them properly. Sanitize and place in a clean bag. Last but not least - perhaps most important, make sure you are physical fit to use a respirator. All respirators are restrictive, so if you have diminished pulmonary function or cardiac issues check with your Doc. Get a professional opinion on your fitness to use one. As an aside particle dust masks for wood, non asbestos plaster, not lead, not cadmium, dust etc. are far less restrictive and do the job well that they are designed for- again with the proper fit and care. The 3 rating is not for the produce but rather lack of information."
3,You cannot use it for formaldehyde,"I bought this respirator for my wife to use it for protection against formaldehydes, but she cannot it use because on the instructions it says that this respirator cannot be used for ammonia, formaldehyde, paints or coatings containing isocyanate materials, and abrasive blasting, including sandblasting. I rate 3 stars because the respirator seems to be a good one, but it does not serve my purposes at this time and the product's description on the website is incomplete."
3,Cartridge Respirator,"I used the Quicklatch PRO Dual Cartridge Respirator while crawling inside an old sewer tunnel made with asbestos and fiberglass lining. It's not very good for bad odors, as I could smell the noxious old stench but for keeping out flying particles, I think it worked, although I don't know because I would need an X-Ray to tell. The replacement Cartridges might add up after a while, but it beats getting a metal lung in your chest or a sewer pipe in your eye.Sewers: Replacement and New Construction(Vol 2)Cinema Sewer: The Adults Only Guide to History's Sickest and Sexiest Movies!Camco Manufacturing Inc. 39551 Easy Slip Ready To Use Sewer Kit"
4,"nice, but exspensive",it's a vary nice unit. but the next day i found another. this unit was returned
2,too much but not enough,"this is not good enough for the serious pug owner - it is too general regarding dogs but not nearly specific enough regarding pugs. the format is haphazard - one gets the impression that the author has 'read up' on pugs in order to write this book, but i doubt if she had owned or shown a pug. the index is all over the place; avoid this book and buy one by a professional pug expert."
5,Buen libro,"Es un buen libro, tiene muchas sugerencias y recomendaciones de para vivir plenamente con nuestro Pug, lo que si es importante es que hay que dedicarle tiempo a nuestro Pug para entrenarlo y educarlo, esto desde pequeño."
1,skin deep indeed,"This book added nothing to my understanding of how to treat my skin concerns: it was, in fact, really just a dictionary of skin conditions and treatments with none of the opinion or ideas needed to facilitate medical or cosmetic understanding or decisions."
3,Defective?,I ordered these clubs and received in time for my golf outing with my friends. Problem is.. I believe they are defective.. Every time I hit the ball.. the ball just wouldnt go where i aimed. This has to be the fault of the clubs..... Nice set for the money spent. Golf bag is excellent quality. Cant find a better set for this amount of coin.
1,NOT FOR HAPPY GILMORE,"ON MY FIRST HAPPY GILMORE DRIVE WITH MY PUTTER THE HEAD SNAPPED OFF. I AM VERY UNSATATISFIED WITH THESE CLUBS NOW I WILL NEVER BE LIKE HAPPY. AFTER MY PUTTER SNAPPED I THEN USED THE DRIVER. THE SLIPPERY HANDLE MADE ME LET GO OF MY CLUB AND STRUCK HOME MY NOW DEAD PARTNERS HEAD.SINCERELY, CHUBS"
3,Average product,"I used it few times so far and I feel this is a ""not bad at all"" product. Quality of the carry bag is not good. Clubs are average. I used it 20 odd times and no damage yet to the clubs. This is a good choice as a first golf club set."
1,Disposable Clubs,"After only about 20 swings, the head of my 4 iron snapped off. On the next outing, the head on my 5 wood came loose. Great bag, but the quality of the clubs is reflected in the price."
2,Hobo tool,This product was smaller then I thought it would be.Gift for grandsons who are in scouts hopefully it will be something they can use.
3,"Small tool, cool look, good enough, I guess.","I bought this tool thinking it was the size of a typical pocket knife (approximately the length across the palm of your hand when closed). I was a little disappointed to find that it's only about two-thirds of that size. That said: it's a little small for serious function, but it's very portable and does the job in a pinch.The design and materials look good and feel solid, but the size of the tools is disappointing overall (the spoon especially).Bottom line: If you're going backpacking and space is at extreme premiums, this is a great tool to consider. Also, if you like taking precious, little, baby bites when you eat your Dinty-Moore stew, this is your multi-tool."
4,lunch box pal,fits well in my little lunch box easy to clean and store use it almost every day at work never leaves my lunch box and i never have to look for a spoon or fork for its size and price i am very pleased
3,more cute than functional,"If you are looking for a camping tool-look for a more decent size. If you are going to use this as a lunch box tool-open packages, eat yogurt, etc-this is a good tool.pros: sturdy, quality carbon steel, functional-knife, fork, spoon and an opener.cons: size of the spoon is so small, that it's not practical for anything, really."
5,lunch box buddy,fits in my lunch box because of its small size sharp blade great can opener easy clean up my son loves his its his first pocket knife he take it camping and road trips
4,Good for someone on the go...,"This hobo knife is great for someone who is on the go. I leave it in my purse and whip it out when I'm at work, school, or not in the kitchen. I have gone out on the jobsite and either have a yogurt or something that I need a fork for. This tool is great because you don't have to carry around a spoon, fork, and knife. Great tool for someone who goes everywhere! It's a wee bit heavy, but not that bad..."
2,Somewhat dissapointed,"Don't get me wrong, I think Mana is a great band and Alex Gonzalez is probably one of the best musicians around . I just think that AEC is a boring CD. It seems like this CD is ( and maybe should have been) an extension of Revolucion de Amor (like a double CD). What bothers me is that the band took all these years to come out with an average, not very original material. A Cd about love is ok, but Mana already made one...their last one.I think they are sticking to what Warnermusic likes. Moneymaking...I hate to say this but this CD is not good."
4,Amar Es Combatir from Mana,"This is the old Mana that I've known and loved, I really enjoy listing to the CD it brings back memories and the sounds of old when I was down in Mexico. I can hardly wait for the concert tour."
4,Very Good CD,"You may have bought this one for Labios Compartidos, but Tu Me Salvaste is the song you'll replay over and over. Best songs on the disc are Tu Me Salvaste, Arrancame El Corazon, Combatiente, and Labios Compartidos.The disc covers the familiar Mana themes of surreal sirenic women and heartbreakers with heavenly bodies. I've come to expect and enjoy that about the group. They also as usual show versatility and mix up the style of play.I was disappointed in the CD version of Labios Compartidos. It wasn't recorded with the same force or passion the the single being played on the radio was.In my opinion Tu Me Salvaste is Mana's best single and Amar ES Combatir as a CD is second only to Suenos Liquidos."
2,Amar Es REPETIR,"Nunca me ha impresionado la letra de las canciones de Fehr. Escribe como que esta inventando la letra al mismo tiempo que canta. La musica no ha evolucionado, pues siguen atrapados en los ochenta. Pero de alguna manera todavia me gusta Mana. Siempre comerciales, pero siempre entretienen. Mis favoritas obviamente ""Labios Compartidos"" y ""Bendita Tu Luz"", que son las mas originales. El resto del album se nota que Fehr estaba desesperado por terminarlo. Todas las canciones mas o menos son iguales. Pero chequen: ""Tu me salvaste"", ""Manda una señal"", ""Arrancame el corazon"", y ""somos mar y arena"". Estoy seguro que esta ultima va a estar en la radio con algun exito."
2,IT'S ONLY ANOTHER ALBUM,"I like the music of mana many years ago, but personally I don't like this new album because the sound are the same, the lyrics are the same than the others albums, anyway you need to listen a lot times, maybe you like it."
2,nothing new...love...love...but that is all Maná about,"Well what can I say, this album hasn't anything new, if you buy this CD you won't miss anything you haven't heard from Maná. There are a couple of good songs like ""Bendita la Luz"" with special guest Juan Luis Guerra and the reggaee song ""Dime Luna"". The other songs are the same songs from previous albums, the difference is new music and re-written lyrics. These are the best Maná's albums:1.¿Dónde jugarán los niños?2.Sueños líquidos3.Cuando los angeles lloran4.Revolución de amor5.Amar es combatir6.Falta amor7.ManáSorry for the 2 stars, but if Revolución de amor wasn't a good album, is better much better than this."
1,"ES IGUAL, ES LO MISMO","Hey, if you are a fan of this band I am sure you will love this album, but this is just more of the same. This band certainly sounds on every new record the same. They always have to include something as ""El rey tiburon"" on every records and ""Labios compartidos"" is almost a clon of ""mariposa traicionera"" or whatever its name was. Production is awesome but thats all its worth it. Oh, and did somebody notice that the letters they use on the cover art are the same from Madonnas American Life?? Geez!"
4,practicle casting,is mostly clear and to the point.illustrations are good.examples are a little lacking.navigation through the book is easy.its hard cover is an advantage in studios.
5,Another McCreight Gem,"Tim McCreight's books are always excellent, and PRACTICAL CASTINGis yet another gem. I especially appreciate it's easy to follow format and the author's generous ""make-it-yourself"" directions for tools and gadgets that can be easily put together by the jewelry crafter. These tips really come in handy and save having to buy yet another expensive doodad to complete a process."
5,Love This CD!,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS CD! Smooth stylings of the 90's with some of the best R&B vocals. Buy it. NOW! :)"
4,A Piece Of Spanish Heart !,"Well, Well, Well !Here is an Album i Loved it from first ( Sight ) hearing this following Song's;Title 4 : Te Necesito ! Spanish way to say I Need You !Title 5 : Come TO Me !Title 8 : Kiss And Make Up !Title 9 : I've Got What You Need !Some song's are not bad becuz you will dance to 'em but this above song's are Really Great no Joke, they are SlowJam song's that's my Favourite thing when it comes to relaxin' on Sunday's !A Must Collect Album !"
4,good movie,"well, maybe the guy in the main role could have a better perform (specially when they recreated the video clip of ""Rock me Amadeus)but anyways, is a good biopic"
1,Incorrect item description,"Be warned, the description for this regulator states It has a maximum input pressure of 250 PSI but when I received it, the box states the maximum input pressure is 150 PSI. I called Campbell Hausfeld directly and they said the box is correct, and that they need to update their description of the item. This looks to be Cambell Hausfelds fault as every place I found this regulator on the web had the incorrect description ""From the Manufacturer""."
4,does the job,"does what it is suppose to do, if needed i will buy another one in the future, would reccomend this to others"
2,A big let down,"Blue Seed 2 lacks the story and plot developments of the original. The only episode I liked was the third one, which had nothing to do with it! The english voice acting was lacking as well. Kusanagi just sounded so mono-toned all the time. I thought the old drawings were better. (I mean, look at what they did to Kusangai!)"
3,"Enjoyable, yet...","I'm a fan of the Blue Seed series and was delighted to hear that they were putting out this OVA on dvd. As far as sequels go it was decent if unspectacular. Maybe if they had made the episodes longer or had had more of them it might have been able to flesh the story out a bit more, it kind of felt rushed. Some of the humor of the original series is missing here and also some of the heart. Please don't get the idea that I didn't like this...I'm glad I bought it, I was just hoping for a little bit more..oompf."
1,Beware those who enjoyed the original!,"I brought this because I really enjoyed Blueseed. I fell in love with the characters and the storyline! You can imagine my utter boredom while watching this supposed ""Blueseed Beyond"". None of the characters are developed, the guy who made this was riding off of the characterization in the original Blueseed. The story was very unengaging and went very fast ... maybe it went so fast because there wasn't much storyline at all. This sequel lacks the emotion and genius the first one had. They changed the voices ... if you thought Momiji's voice was annoying in the first one, wait till you hear it in this second one! The actors who did the voices lacked the passion of the original actors. All in all the frist two episodes that dealt with the Aragami sucked, but the third one that had nothing to with the Aragami was fantastic ... that's said considering Blueseed's focus was destroying the Aragami. It could have been MUCH better!"
2,Skip it!!!,"If you're a fan or even seen the original Blue Seed, just run quickly away from this second series. It was positively horrid! Forget the action, the majority of this Seed seems to focus on annoying would be love connection between Momiji and Kusinagi (keyword being annoying!)."
2,not even close as good as the original,"not good enough as i was expecting, the plot is slow and the characters are not as funny as they were"
5,Can't believe the price,"Halston Sheer is a floral fruity scent, featuring apple blossoms, sandalwood, lilac, pear and musk. Women who wear it claim it drives men wild. I bought this for my wife, and have to admit there may be something to that claim. The head notes last no more than 20 minutes, but the middle notes are pleasant and keep the thrill going for an afternoon or evening."
1,Never received this order,I have never received this order unitl today (April 26th 2009) although my credit card was charged. Letter to Beautiful Perfumes was not answered. All my other orders from Amazon com in the past few years were without problemsAlma Dzubur Kulenovic
1,Dental Hygiene,"Heard this in my dentist's office while waitingfor the novacaine to numb my gums. After listeningto Richard Elliot, I didn't need the novacaine.If you want to experience the clean numb feel ofa dentist's office, here's your man!"
5,Goodtime is an excellent album,"I'm not one to listen to a lot of Gospel Music, but I just can't put this album down! Lee Williams & the Spiritual QC's get my vote for the R&B Group of the millenium. From the title cut down through the tracks to ""Let's Get Down,"" I was clapping, stomping & grovin' my way through. Then I got to ""You've Been Good to Me."" Blues at its finest, it had a powerful effect on me... I pulled my car to the side of the road and reflected on my life.Can't wait to see the video!Favorite cuts: You didn't Have To,"" ""Let's Get Down,"" ""Goodtime,""You Been Good to Me"" If you just plain love great R&B, make sure you give Lee & the QC's a look."
5,Good Time - CD,"Lee William's & the Spiritual QC's is a group that does not play when during the work of God. By that I mean, when they are ministering to you in music they are about God's work. You can feel this mans spirit and know he is about the Father's business.He stands flat footed and sing. No talking in between song, just singing the praises of God. God has truly blessed him. I find him to be a true christian off the floor as well as on the floor."
5,God's Gift,"Listening to Lee Williams is like listening to the wind calmly blowing through the trees. His voice is so calming, it will bring peace into the life of the biggest devil. Lee Williams and the Spiritual QC's are the best. I really enjoyed seeing them live in Albany, Georgia and look forward to seeing them again and again. Can't wait until they come back to Southwest Georgia."
2,Instructions,"I wish it came with some instructions. I have the loupe, but don't know how to use it. What exactly am I looking for when I look at gems / stones. I am a novice and need a little guidance as how to use this thing."
4,Hoodia SuperThin capsules,"Have used product for 2 1/2 weeks and it does what it says, It curbs your appetite without any side effects, no headaches, heart racing, blood pressure stable. I haven't been on the scale just yet but my clothes are loser"
2,Not enough of a good thing,"There are two things the buyer would not know about Amazon's Hoodia from the advertising until it's too late (after the product has been delivered to your door): 1. that it comes in gelatin capsules (not vegetarian) and 2. that the dosage is a low 250 mg per capsule. By comparison, Costco sells 150 Hoodia tablets of 500 mg each for about $34 (plus tax, but no shipping charges). The best Hoodia I've found is Hoodoba Pure, available at [...] They are vegetarian, 60 tablets per container of 750 mg. Hoodoba Pure may seem a bit more expensive, but it's the most effective I've found."
1,Didn't do what is says.,I took this product for about 6 weeks and I didn't see any change. If anything I was even more hungry. I would not reccomend it.
3,One inadequate sampler plus an unwieldy elephant,"This collection, like ""The Gentle Side of John Coltrane,"" assembles a number of ballad highlights from a major tenor troubador's seminal sessions. And like the Coltrane collection, which closes with a furious, on-location ""I Want to Talk About You,"" this one closes with on-location fireworks--the hyped-up approach Dexter characteristically brought to ""Body and Soul"" toward the end of his career. Problem is, his sensitive reading of the tune 7 years earlier on a studio date, ""The Panther,"" on which he's joined by an equally inspired Tommy Flanagan, beats this one hands down. With the exception of this inferior B&S and ""I'm a Fool to Want You"" (from ""Clubhouse""), all of these tunes are on indispensable recordings that no fan of Dexter would want to be without. Go with the original programs, and pass up this elephant for The Panther."
4,A thoughtful look at money ... and the world,"Thomas Elpel's book covers a broad span of topics, from do-it-yourself skills around the house and garden to international economic theory and practice, but its core message is that many people seem to plan their lives backwards. They go out to make money without first thinking about how to spend it to make themselves secure and happy, or how their work might hurt the environment and other people. Elpel proposes that we first decide what we want in life, including material wants, then work toward those things as goals, making money when we need it but not as our primary objective. Not everyone will want to move to the country and raise their own food, but every reader of this book will find food for thought and kernels of insight into the way our lives, the economy, and the world function. A lot of people who frequently get themselves into financial trouble would benefit from this book but, unfortunately, they're probably the ones least likely to read it."
5,Paradigm Shifting,"I discovered Field Guide to Money about ten years ago and was so struck by the power of it that I evangelized everywhere I went about the simple truth that he was able to so eloquently convey within it's pages. That truth is this: Money is a token to represent calories, and we live in a system designed so inefficiently that we waste as many dollars as we create, and so we effectively burn our calories without getting any work from them. In closing the loop on waste in our lives we can effectively give ourselves a pay raise, have more free time and reduce our carbon footprints. I was so effected by that book that I restructured my life in many ways and now, even in this recession my wife and I are able to live well and put money away. This is an amazing book and the one of the best investments I have ever made."
3,Lots of information,"Lots of Information, but hard to read. I really liked the message though.Brian Housewert"
5,a great entry level MP3 player,"I recently purchased the Creative Zen Nano 512 MB MP3 Player Black and use it in my car with an iRiver FM transmitter.Pros:Flash drive, no moving partsHolds about 9 albumsEasy to use softwareAt $70, much better price than an iPodCons:Should have opted to 1GB model, have to load new music weeklyJust copy MP3s, if you use the built-in compression program, you can fit more, but it sounds tinnyNo built-in interface to car stereo, like iPodI am happy with the purchase, my goal was to try out MP3 player technology and hook it up to a car stereo for around $100.When I upgrade my car stereo, I'll buy an iPod, simply because you can plug in and control directly from stereo head unit."
2,Cheap at the time,Bought for my wife and haven't seen it in along time. Even my son doesn't want to mess with it.
2,Cheap plastic leads to shoddy product,"We expected this item to be at least as good as the older Creative MuVo TX we've had for over a year, but we were wrong.The cheap plastic on this Creative Nano MP3 player leads to two drawbacks we experienced within the first 3 weeks we owned it:1) The tiny plastic clip that holds the battery cover in place easily breaks off, and it takes weeks to get a replacement cover from Creative.2) Even when it's inside the plastic case (which you have to buy separately), the unit turns off, loses its settings, or forgets what song it was playing when it experiences light impact, such as dropping 3 inches onto a table.We never had any of these problems with other MP3 players we've had for over a year. The Creative MuVo TX is a much sturdier product, and it even has a better cover. This product was a waste of my money. It gets 2 stars because the software is very easy to use."
3,Good wired router with no great range of signal,"The router its easy to install and work well whith wired conections the wireless conection its not too good because the range of signal its poor (about 24 feet indoor), thats no its so good I install a access point of belkin that has a good range of signal about 40 feet indoor, I have one sugestion if you want a good wired router this is a cheap and great router, if you want a wireless router that not its a very good choise."
2,Kind of Flimsy,"Admittedly, I got this because it was cheap but it's kind of delicate. When it arrived it was already in a couple of pieces. This didn't actually bother me, as I was just planning on using it as a pumice stone- but if I actually had an aquarium I would have been unhappy about it. As a side note, even if it arrives in one piece, I'm pretty sure one minor fall would smash it up pretty good.Additionally, for those who are planning on using this for scrubbing the embedded cat hair out of your oriental rug- don't bother. While the cat hair comes up (slowly), the pumice flakes off and eventually it falls apart entirely."
1,Very Disappointed,"My father purchased the bundle pack for my son, his grandson. The videos appear to be made in someone's home rather than in an academic setting and the man does, on occasion, misspeak as to required functions and rather than editing them out, he tries to go back and correct himself. They are poorly made and certainly not worth the expense. I am fortunate that my child catches on to mathematical concepts fairly easily but these DVD's are not helpful in any way."
4,A very readable story,"This was my first Outlander book. Though I thought it went on too long, I enjoyed the read. The climax for me was the choice of going back or not, and that was long before the end of the book. Excellent storytelling."
5,Great read!,"I bought these books (7 of them, I think) for my daughter who lives in New Zealand and she told me to read them as I'd love them. I'm approaching the end of Cross Stich and can't wait to get started on number two. It's a rip roaring yarn with a bit of something for everyone. Although it's basically fantasy, it's historically interesting too and quite raunchy in places without being too specific! Highly entertaining."
5,Once you have read this you will be hooked!,This is the first of the series by Diana Gabaldon and not only is it an interesting fiction with some romance it incorporates the concept of time travel and history. These books are a great read and like me you won't be able to wait till you read the next one.
4,cross stitch,I have previously read daina garabaldon books couldnt put them down really good read. great characters. good story line.bit of history bit of romance bit of adventure.
5,First Outlander book,I loved this book. It's a great read with strong characters and a good storyline. Something a little out of the ordinary with the time travel aspect. I could not wait to download another 4 of the Outlander series.
5,An excellent read,This is the first book in a series of seven. The author has totally mesmerized me with her writing - I feel like I am living the story with the characters. Despite being fiction I am learning a little about the geography and history of Scotland
3,Bubba Keg,The Bubba Keg in the picture is what I was expecting to get in the mail but instead I got a navy blue Bubba Keg with an orange mouth piece. I wish I had gotten the item that is pictured.
1,Leaks,"We had high hopes for this, but it totally let us down. It was inteded to be used as a drinking cooler for everyday outdoor use, but it leaks from the mouthpiece soaking you as you are drinking. Very dissapointing."
4,wrong color,I love the Bubba Keg line. They keep your cold drinks icy cold all day....but....I ordered blue and received a grey keg with a pink spout. My daughter is not thrilled.
2,WRONG color...,"We have had bubba kegs before and only order new ones because they are lost, they are great! This order as pictured is light blue, they sent navy blue..not thrilled with the pain of having to return. Get the pictures right!"
4,Love the 1941,"This is a classic replica of the 1941 lighter. It's price right, great quality and a nice throw back to a older design. I remove the fluid insert and replace it with Z-Plus Butane Insert. The Z-Plus light fits very loosely in it and you need to use a piece of aluminum foil to make it fit snugly. The standard insert fix perfectly but the Z-Plus with the aluminum seems to push the top part of a slight alignment. It's still a great lighter and definitely worth the money if your looking for something unique."
5,Great lighter and price too.,Great company great price and no shipping! Cheaper than buying a Zippo in your local store!
4,nice,"small, elegant, zippo clicks on open and closed. Hinge seemed a little wiggly for a brand new zippo but it was purchased as a stocking stuffer"
4,Great quality and looks,"It came when they said it would.I really like it. Classic Zippo click,looks, quality but different enough that it has gotten nice comments."
4,A veritable romp one step beside the reality we know,"Rascal Kopf Monkeys is a veritable romp. Three school kids -Frank, Joe and Nancy- embark on a dungeon-crawl (including monsters and treasure, though not in the traditional forms) through some likely and some increasingly unlikely locations and situations, only one small step beside the reality we know and perhaps occasionally love.The force of Good continues to (narrowly) triumph over the force of Evil in the guise of said monsters, bullying hall-monitors and truancy officers. Despite barely escaping death and/or a viscious spanking, the three have a whale of a time and live happily ever after."
1,Stick to Chanson,It is almost painful to listen to the rendition of La Vie en Rose and Hymme a' L'amour compared to Edith Piaf's heart-wringing chansons. I have not yet come across a successful experiment when classical singers attempt to go pop. Shudder!
1,Informative but not for workout,"There is too much talking, too much time looking at the route on maps, not enough scenery along the way. Instead of riding with the camera along a river side, it cuts to a map to show you the route.It would be informative if you are planning that exact trip, but it doesn't show much in the way of scenery or the country."
4,This is true grindhouse,"This movie isn't that bad. It had a good story line and the acting wasn't that bad either. Quentin Tarantino tries to create movies like this and here is one that is true grindhouse. Give it a try. If you like this one, you will really like ""Shallow Ground"". It has about the same budget and the story line in that one is very good as well."
2,Quality well below my expectations,"I love NewBalance shoes because they have great quality and extra wide sizes. But not this pair!First of all, it looks nothing like the picture. It actually looks really green. The logo on the tongue looks so bland and ugly (it just says ""780"")And it isn't made in the USA. (Usually NB shoes are.) I have nothing against stuffs made in China, but this pair was so poorly made. The green paint on the side wears off on my jeans! I can feel some threads of strings on my feet when I am wearing it (and I wear socks).The insoles are really thin too. I bought two pairs of NewBalance shoes. The ones in 780 are thinner. The shape of the insoles is kinda different from the other pairs too.It's functional; it's not like it's falling apart out of the box. But I am not getting my money's worth with this pair..."
5,"If you like HOCKEY and PUNK ROCK, this is for you!","The Hanson Brothers combine wall rattling punk rock with witty hockey-related lyrics that are sure to put a smile on your face. It sounds like a gimmic but these guys back it up with inventive and high-powered music that stands on it's own. I have a punk record store (Zed Records in Long Beach, Ca) and this is a top seller!"
3,It's not the 3 brothers known as the Hanson Brothers it's a Canadian Punk Rock/Death Rock Group,First of all this turned out to not be my kind of music. When I purchased this item I thought I was purchasing a music CD by the Hanson Brothers (the 3 brothers boy band). Instead I found out that this was the Hanson Brothers (the Candian Punk Rock Group). I had no idea that there was two sets of Hanson Brothers singing Groups--The Canadian Hanson Brothers and the American Hanson Brothers. People should be more specific when two groups have the exact same name so that a purchase like this does not happen to some one else.
4,I gave it a four because,"like one or two songs are kind of slow. But I love ""Let Me Break It Down."" Also ""Spend Some Time,"" ""Sounds Of New York,"" ""Well I Guess You"" and ""Morning After.""I'm waiting on it's ""A Matter Of Time."" But it is on it's way."
4,"Love the book...fun, easy and entertaining!!!!","My nieces and nephews love mac & cheese, so I bought the book to surprise them with some new recipes. So far I've made 5 recipes and each one has been delicious. Now they argue over which mac and cheese I should make. They all have a different favorite. I'll probably surprise them by trying a new recipe each time they come over. The book is not only full of great recipes, it is charming to read. I especially appreciate the witty quotes and wonderful cartoons."
5,Way to go ADV!,"I am thrilled to see Beastmaster finally released on DVD. Out of the three seasons, the first, in my opinion, is the best. ADV-Films have chosen to release Beastmaster in season sets. The picture quality is what I'm beginning to expect from ADV. It's beautiful. ADV releases some of the best quality picture & sound ever. It is presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen, which makes it appear cinematic. The only extra features are all 22 of the episode previews and some ads for other ADV releases. Episode previews are something that I enjoy and want when TV series are released, so I am thankful that they at least added those. It would have been nice to have more extra features, but the show is being released more quickly than some other ADV series. (Mutant X, Farscape, & Andromeda for example.) Considering the price and the quality of this set, you should buy it today."
5,Wonderful series. Trekkies: Try this out,"I was very sceptical when I bought the first series thinking I would hate a series based on a muscle bound Tarzan like man. I am an avid Trekkie and have watched every Star Trek episode made, up to and including the 2nd season of Enterprise. What could I possibly see in a Jungle based series with no scientific implements or space exploration.The very first episode blew my mind with it fabulous cinematography and excellent sound effects. Once I got into the series it started to look very similar to the original Star trek. With Dar replacing Captain Kirk and Tao as his right hand man the thinker (Spok without the Vulcan ears). They are out to explore the world and right its wrongs. Amusingly the sourcerers even have their own version of the ""Prime Directive"" which prohibits them from interfering in human affairs.The special effects are great, the costumes are wonderful and the setting absolutely spectacular."
4,The Cruel Sea,"This is the only Cruel Sea album I have heard. Great stuff. The Australian band do a great job of mixing swamp rock, blues, and pop to acheive a compelling mix. The lead singer shows passion and swagger. The guitarist has a wide variety of hooks and does a good job playing to the song. If you like blues with a dirty pop attitude, you'll like this."
5,"GREAT CD, GREAT PRICE!!!!!","This the perfect CD to start with for an introduction to The Cruel Sea, and you can't go wrong for under $1.00!!!"
1,Disappointed,"The music is fine, but I was misled into thinking this was the full-length album, not a four song EP. I don't think the product description made it clear this was just an EP."
2,Rest doesn't match the title track; lyrical content disappointing.,"This album has a good atmosphere, a rootsy surf-rock sound.But as completed tracks, nothing else on this album has as much finish and is as satisfying as the sublime title track. I recommend downloading that from itunes (or wherever), cause its magnificent.The album has an unevenness: the instrumental tracks feel part of a different album to the songs with vocals.The main disappointment is the lyrics on the rest of the tracks: first off, there's only about four songs with lyrics, and the lyrics aren't that good."
1,Hard Gun,"This is the worst action movie on BD as I have had ever watched. Although the pictures are clear, bright, but not as impressive as BD can provide. The sound as 2.0 surround is miserable, does not make the movie exciting any more. However, for entertaining, it is quite acceptable."
3,Tony Jaa,"This one has my karate king, (next to Bruce Lee) in it but Tony died right off the bat in the very first fght. Dumb."
2,Tony Jaa,"I would have to say, unfortunately this is one of his movies that i did not like at all. Probably one of Tony Jaa's first. I prefer his newer films like The Protector and ONG-BAK:The Thai Warrior(2005) which happen to have better story lines,acting and visual effects."
2,GREAT FILM,"This film ia about 8 years old,not an up to date release.The print is watchable, sharpness is excellent,though there are some badly shot Interiors.but the film is filled with negative and print scratches,TOWARDS THE END OF REELS. It's then ok for about 17min of each reel.Having said that the film is quite goodI quite enjoyed it, there is a terrific fight at the end with Tony Jaawho plays one of the bad guys ,and he is in the film about 30min tops.The rest of the cast are OK.Recomended to Tony Jaa fans.,one of his early appearencs.Navarre who put this out should be congratulated for releaseing this warts and allThey are also putting out 2 Shaw Brothers films with Restored prints,done in Hong Kong by Celestial Films.great ,Can't wait."
5,the best novels of world war 2,"The best of Evelyn Waugh works, this trilogy is the perfect combination of story and history. Waugh's actual experience during the war leaves its mark all over the place, as well as his particular brand of humor - and his distaste for communism. Great read for anyone who wants to be entertained by a touching story, and see how the war was fought by the British, and why they turned against Churchill when it was won. Even if you don't care about any of that, the jokes are still fantastic, and most of the characters are brilliantly developed. They don't make novels like these ones anymore."
1,Why you should not buy this book,"This is the poorest assembled book I have ever seen. The pictures are dark and blurry, and look like they where copied on a cheap copy machine. As for the content, I could of got the same information out of the manual that came with the copy machine. Save your money."
4,A great book for the Gemini of the world,This is a great book for any Gemini. It has a lot if useful information about us air signs.
5,Great magazine,"This magazine has such great variety, from current world new coverage to human interest stories. It's a great magazine for someone with German as a second language. It always comes on the same day every week.... I highly recommend this magazine."
3,a good overview of some important topics,"This book is excellent reading material for anyone who isn't nervous about delving into controversial topics of bioethics. It's clearly written, covers a wide range of topics, and is sure to spark lively conversations."
5,nice blend,"My 7 month old really like this blend. It seems to me that you can taste corn better that squash in this combination, and it's more on the sweeter side- that's what babies like best."
3,Good but not great,"I bought this CD after listening to ""Be Be Your Love"" and ""Reason Why"" on her website. Those are two great songs but unfortunately, they're also the best songs on her CD. The other songs are less unique and less memorable. ""Worn Me Down"" and ""Quiet"" are thoughtful and personal but they just didn't ""get"" me. That said, this CD is still a whole lot better than many CDs out there and Rachael has a very good voice. And ""Reason Why"" is a great sad song to have on repeat if you're driving alone late at night."
1,No Thanks,"I appreciate the music and would have given this album 3 stars, but I won't buy anything with copy protection."
5,Happenstance,"I loved this album when I first heard it and listened to it every day, as it was in my cd alarm clock. My daughter started listening to it recently and I came to realize how well Rachel's music holds up over time. I still love it! Looking forward to hearing something new."
5,Beautiful,"Rachel Yamagata has a beautiful voice capable of expressing a wide range of emotions. Happenstance is the kind of album that never gets old; I bought it in late 2004 and I still play it non-stop. I am quite taken with Yamagata's apparent talent as a singer, musician, and songwriter. She's someone to watch out for."
4,Good Stuff,I liked this cd. I had to listen to it a couple times to really like it though. I love be in love.
5,worth the money....and then some,"I saw Rachael Yamagata in concert with Liz Phair and then was lucky enough to catch her on her own tour. She has an incredible voice and sings from her heart. If you can get her EP, I reccommend that too... it has a different version of Worn Me Down."
4,Kinda like Fiona Apple - only optimistic,"Her voice is a lot like Fiona's. Dark, smoky, the fluctuations in her voice telling almost more the story than the words themselves. She's also quite fond of the piano, reminding me of the Tori Amos albums I listened to obsessively 10 years ago. But her lyrics aren't as out there as Tori's or as dark as Fiona's. Her songs are primarily about love - the getting together and breaking apart of relationships. In Worn Me Down, she sings about her current partner's affection for another girl, in I Want You (my favorite track) she sings joyously and rapturously about a man met in London to what sounds like a well-orchestrated carnival in the background. Track 6, 1963, is another glorious love song. I'm not quite sure what she means when she says ""I feel like I'm loving you in 1963"" but it sounds lovely, doesn't it?"
5,Emerging talent,"Yamagata at first sounds a bit like Fiona Apple, but she has a lot more depth and range in her songs. A beautiful voice with soulful, sad lyrics, but one of the best albums I've heard this year. She also gives a great live show. Give more then one song a listen, although if you pick just one, the first track, 'Be, Be Your Love' is one of the best."
3,"Awesome music, but won't buy on principle","My friend owns this cd, and we have played it until we know every word to every song. It's awesome. But she can't save it to her computer-it's ""copy protected."" For that reason, I will not buy it. The law states that it is ok to make a copy of a cd for your own personal use. I always make a ""car copy"" of my cds so they don't get messed up from being in my car, and I use my computer as my stereo (like many people these days), so i need to be able to copy it to my hard drive in order to keep my disc drive free. The most ridiculous thing is that, for 30 bucks, you can buy software to rip copy protected cds. what's the point? RCA is hurting this artist, not helping her. The only people they are helping are themselves."
5,Rachael Yamagata - underappreciated,"I first heard Rachael Yamagata in the movie Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and was absolutely in love with that song in the movie (Be Be Your Love, which I think is the best track). I went to get her CD right away and was so surprised that she isn't more well-known. She has a very sultry voice that is extremely captivating. She has kind of a warm, relaxing voice similar to Norah Jones. But, she's more upbeat then Norah Jones such as with tracks 1963 and I Want You. But then there are those tracks that make you want to sit back and relax and just listen to that gorgeous voice (I'll Find A Way, The Reason Why). There's a mix of jazz, lounge, pop. This is definitely worth getting and listening to. Her EP is also a great addition if you like this type of music. I hope to see her more often."
2,I was not impressed,"I realize that this was one of Nora Roberts' earlier books, so the fact that the writing was not as good did not surprise me. However, I was very dissapointed that she speant almost no time letting the readers see Seth's thoughts until the very end and then, in a very uncharacteristic move for Roberts, allows her heroin to forgive him without too much changing or apoligizing on his part. I think this was an interesting book to read because of the fact that it was so early into Roberts' career but as a novel, I was just not impressed."
5,Great book,"This book is probably one of the best all around guides to buying property, and was on time and in great shape."
1,Complete Waste of money,"This will be my first and only online review of any of my 200+ books in my library. But it needed to be said... The Biggest disappointment I have ever purchased...1 StarTwo Thumbs DownA Complete waste of money!212 total pages (With Huge fonts and Filler pages after every Chapter Title Page)4 Pages of Filler for ""note""-taking in the back17 Pages of ""Constant Payment Tables/Remaining Loan Balance"" ChartsThe Book Averages 4 pages (Sides not full) per chapter of infoPage 151 is the Start of the Appendix"
1,Waste of money,"This book is a total waste of money. It is comprised of just one ""hypothetical"" case study spread out over 20 chapters. Save your money and buy the cheaper ""The Complete Guide To Buying And Selling Apartment Buildings"" by Steve Berges or Making Money With Small Income Properties"" by Gary Eldred. Both are far better and more comprehensive books."
5,Probably The Best Book On This Subject,"I have read and own numerous books on real estate investment and found this one to be one of the most concise and detailed books on apartment house investing on the market. I really don't understand what a previous reviewer meant by that it was a total loss. I found it to be detailed and informative. It literally takes you by the hand leads into investing on a property. I will be following the author's advice and begin investing in small apartment properties. If you are seeking true financial independence, you would be wise to purchase this book and not the crap promoted on late night t.v."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Former investment banker Jeffrey C. Hooke now carries out financial deals in the developing world. He describes the potential for doing business or investing in the world's 156 emerging markets. Hooke is realistic about the great risks - such as unstable governments in impoverished countries - but he highlights future potential. His book is a solidly researched and clearly written guide to assessing the business climate and deciding what types of products make the most sense in different developing countries. After an overview of the nature of emerging markets, why companies want to participate in or avoid these markets, and how to invest and make loans there, he looks at particular markets in Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. We [...] recommend this worthy book to those considering working or investing in emerging markets, but academics or readers interested in how business is conducted in foreign places may also be intrigued."
2,An Almost- Ordinary Book,"A few of the stories stand out; most do not. Even as a nurse, I found many of the stories to be important perhaps to the teller but not necessarily to a reader in any walk of life. I guess I was expecting something on the level of the Chicken Soup for Nurses and this, to me, fell short."
5,Capra-Corn at it's Best!,"This is a great movie, one of Frank Capra's best. Gary Cooper gives one of his best performances as the 'pixelated' Longfellow Deeds, and Jean Arthur is also great as the 'cute' reporter and Deed's love interest. Capra-corn to the bone, but also extremely entertaining and a very honest cinematic experience. From a scale of 1-10 I give this movie a 9!"
4,Mr Deeds Goes to town,One of the classic movies of its era. One that you can share with your grandkids.
3,it's OK,"Great setup, but Babe's perfidy was so vile that she should have hanged herself about halfway through the movie. She didn't, and she gets forgiven, which I don't buy for a second.I would like to see a remake that's not so naive. That is, a remake in which an innocent man eventually becomes corrupted by wealth and power, which is what always happens. Duh.Another thing: I sure do miss the days when you could punch people. Sigh. Now everybody's got their lawyers in tow."
3,Mr. Capra Goes Overboard,"Director Frank Capra's work doesn't hold up as well today as some of his contemporaries' because of his habit of over-inflating his scripts. ""Deeds"" starts out wonderfully well when the tuba-playing small-town yeoman Gary Cooper inherits a fortune and heads for the big city to look into it. But Capra can't leave well enough alone and transforms the funny contrasts into a ridiculously overblown sanity hearing. Capra repeated the same missteps in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Meet John Doe"", straining for social commentary and ending up with pomposity. Still, I would recommend Deeds and those other two pictures for all the scenes Capra got right. Cooper serenading the townspeople by playing ""Auld Lang Syne"" on his tuba from the back of a departing train is a real classic."
2,just to naive to be true,"This kind of social comedy, with its naive eulogy of the simple man, the inocent farmers and the small american town, just gives me the creeps. Look out for the way it is satyrized in Preston Sturges' ""Sullivan Travels""."
4,Mr. Deeds,Good show. I enjoyed the updated version with Adam Sandler more than this one but this version was very good also.
4,Mr Deeds Goes to Town,Gary Cooper never gave a poor performance and this one is in keeping with his simplistic acting style. But it is Jean Arthur that really is the glue that holds the film together -- another under-rated actor
4,This is a helpful little booklet.,"MSM is such a wonderful supplement. I now take it quite regularly. I have so much information on it now, I've become quite a little storehouse.You can get a lot of information via email from: msm@wiseinformation.com (The information is send automatically when you write to the above email address).Get the booklet and read about something natural. Amazon also offers a couple other titles on MSM ..."
2,Motor burned out,"Bought one with this model number and made by Phillips in 12/05 but doesn't look exactly the same, must be last years model but the motor burned out after 4 months. It did fine until then but you could here it slowly getting tired each use. Probably repaired about 25 disc before the end. Doesn't even mention anything about warranty anywhere. Oh well...."
1,Simple idea S-T-R-E-T-C-H-E-D too far...,"The premise of the book is summed up simply if you put contrasting colors together, they...ummm contrast...Pretty pictures sure but nothing in techniques, or theory that shake the foundation of quilting. There are many other authors who have put more work into color theory, and design whose books would be a better addition to your collection."
5,Contemporary look to quilt,Love this book. I like a more contemporary look and this book fills the bill for ideas for a more contemporary looking quilt.
4,REALLY good book!,This book is all a romance novel should be. I love the fact that Isabelle loves Simon but she's been so damaged by her father it takes her a long time to even realize it. Simon's love heals Isabelle & makes her a loving woman. And their passion is so sensual. This one is a keeper!
4,a queen and a princess,i strongly recommend for you to buy this as well with the cd 1. this single features 3 more great remixes of this dance hit. a bonus is a video mix instrumental which is a good music bed for any audio visual production. the copy i have was an import from australia and it comes with a small free britney poster. good for any britney fan...and madonna too.
1,I broke my copy of this!,"This song is ok, in my book. That is not why I broke the cd, however. I broke it becasue every mix on this, except for the first one (which appears on the album) is instrumental save for some snippets of vocal here and there on the two club mixes.Perhaps if the record company is going to screw us cd buyers out of some mixes which are only available on vinyl, can they least give us the vocal mixes? These lame dub-instrumental mixes are designed for the clubs more than the vocal mixes.Perhaps they could have put the FULL Peter Rahforer mix (whose short version appears on EVERY different cd single!) instead of one of these boring and monotonous mixes on it. Oh, and by the way, usually when a mix is mostly instrumental can they at least call it a dub mix which such mixes are usually referred to? That way I know what I can expect.Great, a no-helpful vote. So that person likes dubs. Probally doesn't like Britney and since everything is instrumental....."
3,They're big.,You can put two Manhattans in each glass! I did not know from the explanation that they were so big....you just don't have to mix so many drinks!Maggie
4,Great budget martini glasses,"The Libbey Vina Martini Glass is a fantastic budget glassware. They feel durable and look clean and elegant with a traditional martini glass design. They are a bit on the lighter side and it is clearly visible that the stem and bowl were originally two components fused together (as expected for glasses at this price range). This really doesn't pose a problem for me though as I'm not entertaining the NYC bourgeois.Pros:InexpensiveClean, classic martini glass designDurableCons:LightVisible two-piece designBottom line: Budget martini glasses that get the job done well for simple entertaining."
4,great value,"These glasses are generous size, good shape and feel, good quality glass and (so far) seem strudy. Good quality at this price."
5,Perfect,I love these glasses! They were packed very well and are the perfect shape and size for lovely martinis. They are a little deeper than your average martini glass and therefore you (might) will not slosh your drink all over yourself everytime you pick the glass up to take a drink. (or is it only me who has this problem?)
3,More stemmed bowl than glass?,"As far as martini glasses go, these are pretty much built like tanks. Big, strong, and sturdy. They are very stable and resist breaking.Yet those qualities are ultimately what drag the glasses down.With a 12 oz capacity, they're more bowl than glass. I have a very hefty pour in general, and I don't want to seem skimpy by pouring an 8 oz drink that only fills 3/4 of the glass. As a result, I'm pouring at least 10 oz and guests are getting hammered after only 2 martinis. 12 oz is eight shots of hard liquor. So while the extra capacity might seem like a benefit, it means you have to fill it all the way up.Really thick, inexepensive glass keeps costs down and minimizes loss in the event of breakage, which won't be frequent anyway. But that makes the glasses heavy, clunky, and have very poor optical clarity.I use them for serving food in. I served tuna ceviche in them the other day, and the guests all enjoyed the presentation afforded by the glasses."
5,Classic Design and Sturdy,"These are great glasses. The design is classic, clean, and unfettered. The glasses are sturdy, and they all arrived intact with a decent packing job. The price is reasonable, and they are manufactured in the USA (how rare is that!). I bought several different styles of glasses all from the Libbey Vina series (martini, red wine, white wine, champagne flutes, tall and short tumblers with a thick base), and I am very happy with all of them."
1,POOR QUALITY,The glasses had sharp seams along some of the stems and around the top some of them weren't formed properly.
5,Love these glasses!,"These glasses were very durable and theyre deeper than a lot of martini glasses I've had. The drinks tend to not spill out as easy, which is nice! And I've had these tip over on the counter and in the sink and none of them have broken yet!"
5,Great if you love HUGE martinis,I bought these as a gift. Good price and great shape. They are massive glasses but I knew that's what my friend would want! I would not purchase if you're looking for a good two shot martini glass.
4,Good value in martini glasses,"I've been enjoying my new martini glasses. I agree with others who reported that they are on the large side, but there's no need to fill the glass. The glasses do have a visible ""seam"" which makes it seem less expensive. Still, the price was right!"
4,Shaken or Stirred -- these are a classy bargain,"These glasses are truly a great bargain - elegant, well priced and durable. They arrived in time for our James Bond themed party to boot. My only complaint is that they were packaged in very large boxes but this is a minor quibble. Great buy."
2,Way Too Big!!!,Calculation:1 shot = 1.5ozThese Glasses = 12oz = 8 Shots!!!Review:If you are looking for a huge vessel to hold razzle-dazzle choco-tinis this might be the right glass for you. If you like me you were inspired to make a martini after a 3 day Madmen bender... you want to get a standard sized cocktail glass. The standard size according to wikipedia is 4.5oz.
1,It won't come in one piece,"This was my first foray into online glass buying. Big mistake! Poorly packaged product and someone playing 'catch and crush the package' did just that. Four survived. It was not clear to me where this product was made, but it is not 'fine' glass wear. The glass is unbalanced and does not rest flat on the table, hand-made hopefully, but with little craftsmanship evident. Says it is from Libbey, Ohio on the box but does not state anywhere where specifically where it was made. Pass on this one, and go to 'crate and barrel' or some other glass shop to select your martini ware."
3,Nice glasses if I wanted a set of 5,"Arrived with 1 broken. Not a big deal for me since I was only looking for a set of 4 anyways, but I would have been pretty upset if I was looking for a set of 6.Besides the broken one, they are nice glasses and appear to be of good quality. I'm sure I could contact Amazon to send out a replacement if I cared for it, but this item gets docked a couple stars due to the inconvenience factor."
2,Beautiful but...,"Beautiful, but after 6 months use, they break too easily. 2 down, 4 more to break. Will need to buy a different martini glass soon."
1,This band craps on its fans,"I ordered CD's directly from the band on their website. They happily took my money and never sent me the discs, or replied to any of my followup emails. Is that a band you want to support?"
5,Great films!,Love these films! It's nice to have them together in a nice case. Both films are timeless classics and a must have for any Shah Rukh Khan fan.
4,Carol's review,"Good stuff, I have used before. Not satisfied with the delivery. Took forever and was shipped from Hong Kong. I will not buy from this guy again.Carol"
5,This series just gets better.,Each and every book Tanenbaum is always on target! 5 stars are always the best rave and review I always can give them. What a joy to read.
4,A good bargain set of clubs.,I got this set of clubs when they were on sale for $89.99 with free shipping. The clubs have a good appearance and feel. I'm just starting and I think this a great set to start with for the price. I've used them alot in the in the last 2 months and I've had no problems at all. The bag is also very nice.
2,disappointed in the quality,Disappointed in the quality of the irons. the 5 and the 8 iron each broke after about 100 swings over a period of 2 month. The rubber handle feels cheap and hard in the hands. I am almost becoming paranoid with the rest of the sets. I feel like they are going to break if I swing too much. For its price you get what you paid for.
3,US Crush,"Atomic Boy broke up when one of the members lost it after they racked up too much debt. Members then formed Kickball, which is now US Crush. The drummer joined The Dogs for a bit, now he's in The Symptoms."
2,still not sure,I have used this outside on some of my plants. I haven't noticed changes. I was hoping it would prevent some spiders from leaving webs on my plants but that hasn't happened.
5,Best fun you can have with a stuffed animal,"If you have one of these Bubba Bears and don't laugh you have NO funny bone! I have the orginal Bubba that first came out and the one that goes in the car...I had bought 2 each for my mom and I and we always laugh at that lil bear! I will collect them all, for my mom and I and never take em out of the packages. Heck guys I am just turning 46 years (old guy) and get the biggest kick out of that lil bear! He is great for kids and adults and always brings a smile to your face if you are down in the dumps! I can't wait to get this next lil guy for my collection!"
5,A feast for your eyes!,"If you've always wondered what's actually down below in some of the gorgeous boats you've seen - well now you know! This is a fabulous coffee table book. Maybe a gift for somebody who has everything? For somebody who THINKS they have everything? Or for one who has very little, but loves to dream..."
4,A complete pleasure,"This is the first jazz I've purchased in a very very long time... And it's a beautiful reintroduction to a n artform I'd long forgotten. Tyner's complex stylings are dense yet expressive, and the resulting music is a complete pleasure."
2,shiny chrome,"The product is described as ""polished"" but the metal appears brushed in the product photo. These are pretty shiny."
3,"""Bloody"" Romans","The Roman invasion of Britain seemed an exciting premise for a book, and Scarrow develops a good enough story that that gets even better during the last quarter of the book.However, there are several problems. The biggest is that you never quite feel like you are reading a novel, instead the book strikes you as the introductory episode of a series of short, simple stories. It's as if Scarrow has an eye towards multiple volumes and multiple sales instead of writing a standalone, fully developed novel. The characters are as a result, rather thinly developed and stereotypical.There are also numerous typographical errors throughout the book. Lastly, even though they only get to Britain at the end of the book, the Romans and particularly Macro, continuously use that most British of adjectives...""bloody"". Hearing Roman soldiers ""bloody"" this... and ""bloody"" that... all throughout the book was especially distracting and annoying and struck me as a ridiculous editorial miscue."
3,Young Cato becomes a man,"This is the first book I've read by this author, and I've just recently began reading historical fiction. I like the setting and the battles and the tough lessons that the young main character had to learn. You get a real sense of just how organized, professional and serious the military of the Romans was. I'm sure many of our modern military strategies and techniques were based on what they perfected. You understand the political intrigue that accompanied, guided and hindered the military conquests. The dialogue between the soldiers left me out of sorts, though. It seemed too modern and unfortunately threw me out of the time period with the manner in which they spoke to each other. Otherwise, quite a good read although I didn't learn too much of the history. A little Historical Note at the end explaining and clarifying the facts and/or myths would have been appreciated. I will definitely read the next book in the series, but I'm in no hurry."
4,Eximius!! (Latin for superb),"If you enjoy the writings of C.S Forester or Bernard Cornwell, then you will enjoy this historical fiction. Under the Eagle takes place AD 42 when Claudius was Emperor. Claudius's challenges to remain in power became politicaly difficult because 'Money talks and Bull Crap walks'. To ensure his authority, Claudius appoints Vespasian as the Legate of the Second Legion to acquire a treasure lost in Britian from when Julius Caesar reconnoitered Britian 96 years before.Cato and Marco, the main characters under Vespasian's command are assigned tasks to aid in the completion of the mission which positions them in the middle of a twisted mystery. Imperial spies, traitors, political manipulating, and bloody battles all unfold which completely maintained my interest. I will look forward to reading 'The Eagle's Conquest' (Scarrow's second book) when it becomes available."
2,Weak,"While some of the insights into Roman conquest were helpful, the plot line and characters were distracting at best.The secondary plots of intrique and spies contributed little to the action.I will not further read anything by Scarrow."
4,Under the Eagle: Cato and Macro,I really ejoyed this description of life in the Legion and how young Romans were entered into its ranks. The adventures of Cato and Macro intrigued so much that I have purchased all the following titles of their adventures.
3,Under the Eagle,An OK read. I enjoy fiction from the period and it was entertaining but not as involved as some other authors.
1,A few hours I'll never get back,"I regret the time I wasted on this clunker.For a so-called ""military adventure"" there's an awful lot of chatty, head-in-the-clouds characters. Most of the book consists of cardboard cut-out characters sitting around thinking out loud. What little action is there is poorly described. It's a ridiculous story with completely unbelievable events. If this waste of paper is enjoying any success what-so-ever I would guess this is because it rides upon the coat-tails of other better books that truly deserve the title of ""military adventures"" such as Pressfield's books or those by Jack Whyte.Look into those authors !"
1,Adventure? Heroism? Very funny.,"Not so much adventure and heroism more like the usual B-fiction stereotypes or Rome: people in togas reclining on couches, sipping wine as they pontificate about politics and philosophy. The military types, what few there are, are cut straight from bad WWII movies and moreover rely upon modern slang. A terrible, terrible book."
1,A miserable novel,"A ridiculous story written poorly. Very little about this book can be characterized as military, reckless, heroic or even having much to do with the legions. Preposterous and clumsy dialogue might be worth a few laughs otherwise avoid this terrible book."
1,Bad Book. A Very Bad Book.,I've been walking this earth long enough to know a good book from a bad book and this stinker is BAD. I pity the publishers that agreed to make it a series!
5,its not a history book,"this was a great book start to finish. i cant stand people who judge these kinds of books based on their historical accuracy. they nitpick the smallest things. it historical fiction people, FICTION. if you want to read about what actually happened during this time frame in rome then open a history book"
3,Not close to Pressfield--but worth a read,"Unlike what a recent reviewer wrote, this novel does not hold a candle to Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire."" That book is by far the finest historical novel ever written. However, Scarrow's small book is a decent read, keeps you turning pages, and the characters are well crafted and presented. The place Scarrow stumbles is when he uses occasional modern phraseology 2,000 years ago, and a few thread lines don't fully hang together. (The plot and its outcome is also obvious.) If you enjoy ancient history, read it. (I would have given it 3.5 stars if that choice had been available)."
3,To march with a centurion,"Mr Scarrow has written an enjoyable and readible book that places the reader in the Roman Army in Gaul during the mid First Century AD. The plot is a little far fetched but the action and the characters place the reader back in time and carries him through the book at a rapid pace. I had a little difficulty with the fact that the Roman soldiers spoke with a British accent and used English expressions but since I don't know Latin, I guess that is accepable. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and look forward to his other books."
2,"I understand literary license but man, seriously?","I understand this is historical fiction and not history, but seriously, do some homework. I was cruising along enjoying this in a very history-lite fashion until I hit a major stumbling block: the award of the grass crown to Cato for saving one centurion's life. Probably just me but this sort of thing really angers me. It's lazy. You can practically count on one hand how many generals and legates were awarded the grass crown in nearly a thousand years of Roman history. According to Scarrow they just handed those things out like after dinner mints. Not even Marius or Caesar were awarded a grass crown. To earn a grass crown you had to save a legion or the entire army-not one centurion, not one cohort. Crack a book guy.Do yourself a favor and read Colleen McCullough's Masters of Rome series."
2,Feeble Effort,"It's as if this book were written for teenagers. The story and all the characters were flat and cliched. The plot is weak. The dialog is laughable and all too contemporary. Even in a modern novel, I expect Romans to sound like Romans, not like 21st century teens. I like Scarrow's four-part series on Napoleon and Wellington but this book pales in comparison. Don't waste your money."
5,Wilton sugars are the best,This sugar is so pretty and perfect for decorating cookies for Valentines Day. Also nice on birthday cakes and cupcakes
5,"Awesome Commentary, BUT...","I think others have reviewed these commentaries much like I would, but just to let you know, you can get it for about $200.00 at christianbook.com"
5,It was as good as it she said it would be.,The product was wonderful and everything she said it would be. What a wonderful low price for such a priceless product.
4,Almost perfect,"When I placed this on my counter, I noticed it was a bit wobbly. I was going to send it back, but decided to work with it. The size is great. Seems to wobble less the more I use it."
5,Un disco fuera de serie,"Es la septima compilacion de la serie Aqui esta la bachata es realmente espectacular. Creo que cada vez mas Platano Records mejora la produccion de esta serie y compone todos los exitos de la bachata del momento en una sola grabacion. Si eres aficionado/a o no a la bachata el disco te va gustar porque tiene lo mejor de lo mejor de cada artista y es probable que despues de escuchar el disco compres algunos de cada artista porque es buen ejemplo de la calidad y talento de los bachateros. Te voy a decir esto al escuchar las canciones que estan en el cd no falta nada. Empieza con la mas renombrada cancion de hoy en dia ""Pegame me tu vicio"" y continua con bachatazos que van a hacerte apreciar esta musica que por fin esta recibiendo el reconocimiento que definitivamente merece."
4,it's ok for start!,There are CD's. There is NO book inside. It's ok if you want to learn to listen and speak. The method is to listen and repeat. Sometimes they repeat the same sentence a lot but it's a good way to remember. Basically they teach you to ask and answers to very common questions and at the end of the course you can understand a lot of conversations.
5,Excellent Source!,"This is a great product to use if you want conversational skills. I have many persian friends and I wanted to have some conversational skills to meet some iranians visiting from overseas. I have only completed 4 lessons ( there are 5 audio CDs with 2 lessons each on them) and I really impressed some natives who think I have more vocabulary than I really do. Its because this method teaches you conversational skills. You learn phrases, not individual words which makes it helpful. It is quick but repetitive. I would highly reccomend it."
4,Basic Farsi,"Very good language program, along with the phrase books that I also purchased at other locations, I am on the way to speaking this fluently very soon. I put the discs on my Ipod also and can listen to them anytime, I also plan to work on all the dialects of the language. I also plan to learn all of the other language of the region. Thanks."
5,Canon PIXMA iP6220D Photo Printer,This is an exceptional printer for the money. The card reader capability is a great bonus. Print quality is excellent!
1,No cable,"I just received the printer. In trying to set it up, I realized there is no computer to printer cable included, nor any explanation of what kind you need. You have to bail out of the setup and solve that little dilema."
4,Great Printer!,Love the printer. Nice pics as well as documents come out looking great! Great value! Works fine with Windows Vista!
2,No more canons,"Bought two of these from Amazon and setup the first one ok.Then thought i should try out the second one just in case it didnt work while still under warranty. I didn't want to waste the two ink tanks as i was only going to make sure it printed ok then put it back in the box. So i took out the cartridges from the first one to try in the second one and got an error message that the ink was empty. I then tried to put the orginal cartridges back in the original printer and again wouldnt work, Had to call canon and found out you cant take out a cartridge or try and refill it as it will reset itself and not work. Canon rep had me use the other two cartridges from the second printer and finally it worked ok. Canon is sending me out two new cartridges but i am not happy with canon anymore if i cant refill as they are very expensive and dont hold much ink anymore. NO MORE CANONS OR MAYBE ANY OTHER PRINTERS."
3,Vol. 4,This is a really fun series and I wanted to collect all the volumes. I've enjoyed the mix of adventure and mild fan-service.
2,Fahrenheat baseboard heater,This item arrived fairly quickly and heats well but the construction of this item is very bad I had to redo most of it I have several of this very same make of baseboard heaters in my home but this one was poorly put together no care or pride was used in the construction of this one and no quality control appears to be at the factory that this was made at!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Love Knows No Boundaries,"I had the honor and pleasure of meeting the author, Irene Weinberg, several years ago. I met Irene at the time she began her very private moments through the often confusing and very painful days of mourning and grief after the very sudden and abrupt loss of her husband, Saul, who was the one and only true love of her life. As a result of this unexpected life altering experience, Irene takes the reader on a personal journey of healing as she reveals and shares her many lives throughout the centuries with Saul, her ever present and constant soul and life mate. Enlightening and profoundly spiritual, Love's Eternal Marriage is a book that must be read and reread, for throughout each page, through Irene's profound experiences following the loss of her husband, lies the very essence of the meaning of love, in its simplicity, in its complexity and in its most unconditional form."
4,only one problem,This was an excellent collection. I bought it as a gift for my dad. We listened to it together and the only complaint either of us had was the variation in volume between tracks. It wasn't mixed correctly so some songs were too loud or too quiet. Other than that one problem it was great.
4,"great little show, why no Region 1 dvd?","The story of a single mother from London who persuades her best friend Kenny to pretend to be her husband and accompany her and her two children to Ronansay, a small Scottish island, whose inhabitants advertised for a young family to take over the local B&B and help keep their small school open. This series was shown on PBS stations in the US so it is a great disappointment that it is not (yet?) available on DVD here. Sweet, funny, and sad, and also a realistic portrayal of the stuggles of people on remote islands to prevent a way of life from dying out. Good acting. Paul Kaye is especially fine as Kenny."
5,Have to have item for HD owners,"This is a handy item to have around if you own a sportster. The price was a little high but it's cheaper than bringing your bike to the shop for a diagnosis. Easy to read volume featuring both engines, pre-1986 and also the new EVO motor. Even if the projects in the book are out of your scope to tackle yourself, at least you have an idea of what to expect from the mechanic!"

5,Fun for Little Fingers,I originally saw these at Pottery Barn Kids and my son loved playing with them. He sat and played during my shopping adventure. I did not purchase them at the time but today I pick up several of these at Tuesday Morning for one dollar and 99 cents for a stocking stuffer. They are quite durable and fun for little hands to make silly things with. I don't know that I would personally pay what the P.B.K. wanted for them but for that price they are well worth it. They snap together easy enough for a 2 year old to do it with no problem.
3,Great Ball not Great Rope,This is the third romp-n-roll that I have purchased and if it was my first I wouldn't have purchased 2 more. The rope was shredded almost instantly and my dog isn't allowed to sit and chew on it...just from retrieving it and tossing it around. Looking to get a rope to replace the one that is no longer there.
4,Pretty good,My puppy loves it. He's a lab/boxer mix but the only problem is he destroyed it rather quickly. He had fun with the rope while it lasted but it didn't take him long to pull the rope out the ball. lol
4,Amusing Toy!,"I bought this toy yesterday at a pet supply shop for my boxer/boston terrier mix 2 year old dog. She attacked it when I brought it home and didn't stop all night until it was time for bed. This morning the play resumed and the rope is now in 2 pieces on the floor and she's still attacking the ball. There are holes from teeth marks all in it and it looks like a year old toy, not a day old toy. I would recommend if you have a larger/strong dog then I would recommend buying the version that does not have the rope. In fact, I'll be impressed if this toy lasts a whole week at this rate. Also.. it is very destructive for a rubber ball. It is bouncing all over my living room as I type this... little black and white dog racing behind it. My suggestion is to get this toy for outdoors only unless you have a larger house."
2,Lasted a day.,My dog got the knot out of the rope on both ends. Now she can not manipulate the ball with her mouth because the ball is pretty big. String from the rope is everywhere and she's done with it... I swear my dog should be a test dog for toys.
2,Not tough enough,"I bought this toy for my dog and it claimed that the rope tie could never be pulled out of the ball. Well, that might be true but my dog chewed through the rope part in less than five minutes so I'll never really know. She's not the least bit interested in playing with the ball now."
4,dog ball,"My dog really likes the ball, however, I ordered two and she has already destroyed one. It could be tougher rubber, but otherwise very nice. Will probably reorder unless I find a sturdier one."
2,Not good for a chewer,My dog is a big chewer. He had the rope chewed up in an hour. The ball it's self is good. He has not chewed that.
3,My dog could care less,"My dog loves balls and we love dock jumping so I thought the purple ball would be a visible, attactive lure for her to jump off the dock for. I've seen other dogs jump after them. No luck. For some reason, my dog couldn't care less about it."
3,Safer than push-and-play but not indestructible.,"This toy is much safer than the push-and-play hard plastic ball, as it didn't cause any bloody noses. However, once the rope was removed, my dogs were able to chew off pieces of it near the hole that goes all the way through. One of my German Shepherds played with her ball for months before destroying the ball, but my more aggressive chewing male tore his up in less than a week."
4,80 pound Pit Bull does not destroy,I thought the product would have a bigger rope but my 80 pound Pit Bull loves it! He was able to pull the rope through the hole in the middle so now he has 2 toys. The product is very durable and he cannot tear it up! It's hard to find products that my dog cannot tear up so I would highly recommend this product or any Jolly Balls. The only negative is I would have bought a Romp-N-Roll with a bigger rope so he could not pull through the hole and could take to play fetch in the water with.
5,Boxer loves this item.,"My boxer is a tough chewer. He will work at a new toy or bone like it is his JOB. This is a great toy for him to chew on, carry around, and throw around the yard."
5,Miracle,"I've had this for about a month now and my dog still has not destroyed it! Considering that he can chew through a tennis ball within minutes, I am very impressed with this product. He can still carry it around with his mouth but it's big enough that it won't get stuck under piece of furniture. It is completely covered with teeth marks at this point but there are no signs of holes yet. The rope part only lasted a few days but I almost prefer it that way. He would shake the ball by the rope and I worried that it was going to hit and break something. A must have for all dogs that love balls but also love to chew."
3,OK,I was searching for a song and it was in this CD. So I had to buy the CD to get the song. Maybe it was an impulse to buy a whole CD for 1 song...Will I do it again....?????
1,What can I say...,"about a TV that quits working after 22 hours. Well, for one, I would be hesitant to buy another Samsung product. This may be the finest TV since sliced bread, but it would be hard to prove by me. In addition, their so-called Customer Service Center is ill-named. All they do is serve as a middle-man for the third party repair center. Apparently Samsung has no quality control standards for these centers as it is a mystery to Samsung when the repair center will contact a customer and how long it will take to make a repair. I have been waiting over 4 days for a call back. A TV that doesn't work, can't be returned, and no one knows when it will be repaired."
5,St. Ignatius' improbable legacy,"It may seem very unlikely that an ex-soldier, persecuted by the Spanish inquisition, would oneday win favor with the Pope for himself and his followers. This eventually led to the creation of the Society of Jesus. Their legacy includes the precurser of post-secondary education for the masses. Originally free of charge, this education in science and the humanities was offered to woman and the poor or anyone else who sought to be literate. The Society's influence reached throughout the world, and showed that Christianity could adapt to many cultures including closed societies such as China. Where through years of patience and purity, the Jesuits were the first foreigners to penetrate the forbiden city. This is a very informative read."
1,Naturalistic Spirituality,"You don't need this book for a Dynamic Spirituality for the 21st Century. Instead, turn to the works of the brilliant and ever-so-wise George Santayana. There you will find a genuinely humanistic vision, totally chastened and realistic, yet devoted to cultivating the spiritual life.....within THIS world. Hint: Santayana's influences include Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus, Lucretius, Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and Arnold."
4,great CD,"I just bought this CD, and this is what I have to say about it: the early Stuff Smith recordings from the 1930's and 40's are more swing oriented, this CD is from recordings in Europe (Denmark and Switzerland) during 1965-1966. It is more hard driving, straight ahead jazz, but Stuff still makes it swing. Great backup by Kenny Drew on piano, and the always great Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen on bass. Not what I expected, but great nevertheless."
5,hope it's not their last,"faithless just keeps getting better....""no roots"" is no exceptionthis album is so cohesive and complete i can only hope the linernotes,which allude to the fact that this may be their lastalbum,are not true.....i want more!!!"
2,blah,"I gave this cd a few listens and just couldn't get into it. It's nothing like what I got used to them from outrospective. I was used to the girls subtle voice over some catchy beats. But this album was filled with that dude trying to rap. As for their references to US Politics I wasn't too impressed. It's always a bad idea for a band to inject politics into their music. They can alienate half their fan base with one song. Usually it's just stupid stuff like ""War is wrong blah blah blah"", that sort of nonsense. It wouldnt be so bad if the music was catchy like the previous stuff, but the devolved into some sort of trip-hop act and they dont pull it off. Instead of giving this any time, I'd just listen to the better songs off outrospective again."
4,A Great Fourth Album,"I found ""No Roots"" to be an excellent fourth album from this trio with little flaws musically or lyrically. The single ""Mass Destruction"" is a great song with strong lyrics that follow a style known to fans from maxi. Sister Bliss's beats are still amazing always proving she is one of the greats in djing. I found it an easy listen and would recommend it to anyone wanting to find a new sound. If you are a faithless fan, its a must!!!!!!!!!"
5,Very excellent! With a twist!,"Well what can be said about Faithless? What indeed. They certainly have been around for a looong time now. Dating back to when dance/trance/club music was making huge waves over in the UK scene. But out of all of that, Faithless have grown, lost members and gained new ones. Throughout all of this, the sound of Faithless has remained for the most part constant. Until now. No Roots brings Faithless over the threshold into a new era. Gone now is the signature ""trance/dance"" stand out song we all expected to hear from their releases (IE, We Come One, God Is A DJ). We have instead, a more music and vocal driven selection. Added is a new frontline vocalist along side Maxi Jazz, who brings a soothing change to the group. There are also some really spectacular music only tracks here which can take you on quite the journey without the use of drugs. I highly recommend this cd even if you are not a true Faithless follower. Go for it, you won't regret it."
5,Excellent poles,"Great poles for icefishing, I use them for making Tip Downs. Really good sensativity, well made, and I will buy these again."
2,Disappointing - Better Choices out there ...,"I want to give this DVD more stars b/c Darshan is a great dancer & lovely human being ... but as an Instructional DVD it was a waste of money.World Dance NY's more recent products have improved. This was one of their earlier efforts and suffers from terrible production.In many of the scenes, the image of Darshan is super-imposed over a digitalized backdrop. Imagine small dancer image against spinning magenta or neon green spirals and trying to learn moves from that. It is just plain hard on the eyes. In fact, I watched this DVD once then gave it away b/c it literally hurt my eyes to watch. The psychedelic spinning backdrops reminded me of bad acid.Darshan is wonderful ... but if you want a DVD to learn & practice dance ... I suggest Ariella, Elisheva, Anasama, or Love Potion DVDs which all have much better production.Happy Dancing!"
4,tribal fusion,"This DVD is for intermediate bellydancer.The explications are clear,the teatcher-dancer is amazing , like the choregraphy!And there is french music inside (I'm french!).It's a great moment of tribal-fusion bellydancing!!!!!"
1,Just plain Bad,"Hard to follow routines, no explaination on how to do the moves and frankly no incentive to want to do them. Boring. One for the trash can"
2,An OK choice for beginners,"I bought this DVD with Sera's ""East Coast Tribal"" DVD to help facilitate my at-home practice and I have to admit that it is dull in comparison. The combos are less than stimulating and the crazy lava-lamp background really is distracting from Darshan's teaching technique. Unlike Sera's smooth, graceful combos, Darshan's seem to be a bit tame and boring. Most of them are variations on ATS movements (arabic hip twist, for one) that you can find on Fatchance DVDs or are small isolation combos that you could feasibly make up at home.The one that that is amazing on this DVD is her performance pieces. Darshan really is an amazing dancer and well worth watching... but I have to admit that her lovely performance wasn't enough for me to keep this DVD.I WOULD suggest this DVD for its drills and combos for a beginner, however, since they're simple and clear-cut. However, if you're an experienced dancer who is looking to expand your horizons, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
4,Awesome yet a dissapointment.,"I will say it straight forward, this series is good, but sadly it has one major flaw to it. When I first got into Sorcerer hunters, I was first reading the Manga, then I watched the animated series. Both are awesome, but the one thing that got me down was that it didnt follow the manga one bit. It only has a couple of random parts from both the manga but not every one.The manga is awesome, compared to the animated series, which seems to just fall into a giant loop of insanity every now and then along with emotional heart filled parts. So If you have read the manga first, then your in for a dissapointment, because the chapters from the manga, that had you ready to die laughing, you will never see."
2,Don't know why I bought this,Story line was disappointing. I feel stupid after watching the whole damn thing. This type of anime really does murder your brain cells.
5,Wonderfully funny anime,"I really loved this anime. I loved the stories, how they explored the human condition, and the characters are just great. I loved Carrot and all the troubles he could get into. It made for a very amusing watch."
4,CoffeeAM was out of chocolate mint,"Used to get Barnie's before they discontinued it. A very good substitute for CoffeAM's product, although slightly different. Some might like it more, even."
4,"Not as good as the first one, but........","I've bought episode one as well, which i like better, but the more i listen to this one and i often do, the better it gets...Great for a relaxing moment!"
4,Better than expected,"Considering it's sort of a stunt, this is surprisingly listenable and clever. Not something you play for grandma, but a Christmas classic nonetheless."
4,Love this case!,"My mother fell in love with it, so I bought her one too. It's really small, and the camera fits perfectly! The leather is excellent quality as well.I only wish it had a space for an extra battery. It does, however, provide space for two extra memory cards."
5,Very stylish case,"I ordered this for my Stylus 1010. It fits nicely, a little snug but I love the look of this case."
4,Camera Case,"Very nice case, like the way it looks, but my camera is quite snug inside it, making it hard to snap the closure."
2,My Man (VHS),I was most disappointed in this film. I thought it would be more of a love story than it portrayed. The end was most bizarre.
4,Invaluable Information at so little cost!,"As a ""mature"" student I was in awe of the insights the author was giving us which he has obviously learned on the anvil of experience. As an avid reader I was able to relate to his comments and advice and found myself nodding in agreement. This book is easy to read and full of practical advice, and examples, just the book for budding writers."
3,Exhaustive Information - A Good Reference,"Who knew there was so much to setting? This is a difficult read from cover to cover (as I trudged through it), but it is a good book to keep around as a reference. Not excellent, but good. This isn't so much a ""how-to"" on writing setting but more of a ""why setting is important"".At the beginning of the book the author (Jack M. Bickham) explains that not enough detail is given to setting in writing classes and offers this book as a means to fill that gap. However, Bickham touches on most aspects of writing from the perspective of setting. So, is your plot weak? Look at it from your setting.I would recommend that you read the first chapter or two and then keep the other chapters in mind if you feel you are stuck in a story and believe that an adjustment to setting could bring your story back to life."
4,One of the best,"This is probably one of the best books out there on Setting. Some of the chapters get a bit long winded, but all in all this is the worth getting."
4,Setting: a discovery,This was actually the second copy of this book I've bought. I enjoyed the first one so much I bought the second for a friend.Bickham covers the subject of Setting and how it can be manipulated to enhance your story very well. I particularly liked the sections on how it can be used to advance the plot and build tension.Teresa Reasor
1,Third grade comic book level reading.,The diagolue was really silly in spots. Lacking contractions and other normal conversational parts of speech especially found under combat conditions.
5,Really good read,"David Meadows has a real ""been there, done that"" feel to his writting. Have read all three of his books and while 1 and 2 were good TOMCAT is the best. Can't wait for the next one..."
1,deception,95601 replacement cartridge does not fit the quicklatch respirator I purchased from you.The picture you show is the right picture for my respirator but the 95601 has a mettle base with threads on its outside not the hole in the back with the 3 prong slots.I'd send you a picture of the mask it fits but can't see how.The cartridge I needed has the #8053-p100stamped on it. The 95601 has the #R53-p100 stamped on it.Needless to say I went to the hardware store where I could see the cartridge I'm getting.
2,Fatal Flaw,"Actually the book was a good read until the last paragraph. At that point the author shows great stupidity by revealing that the wealthy rancher has 60 acres. She created a land baron in the book. I felt duped. Sad thing is, the author thinks 60 acres is a lot. This was my first Peart book. I doubt I could read another one. For me, that error, was a fatal flaw."
3,Not a bad book for beginners and intermediate level use of SPSS,"This is a good guide for beginners and intermediate users of SPSS. Provides a good overview of the main functions available in SPSS. My main concern is that the book does little to relate the available techniques to possible combinations of analyses. Perhaps, that's OK since as the title suggests, the book is on ""SPSS made simple""."
4,worth the wait,im in australia and ordered the book from amazon on 17/6/11. It arrived exactly after one month. I ordered two more books together to minimize my shipping cost. Overall it worked out well. The combined cost of three boooks including shipping is equal to the cost of one book I can buy here in Aus. The only issue I have with this purchase is; tracking order showed that the books had arrived in Melbourne and cleared customs on 27/6/11. Why did it take another fortnight after that to reach my place? Oh well I'm enjoying my purchase now and glad I did it from Amazon. The book seems to be bit daunting at first go. It has lot of formulae and calculations. However if you go past the maths there are some pretty interesting and easy to use techniques. I have not been through entire book yet but can't wait now...
3,Great bargain,"The three stars are more for the condition of the book itself, not the overall transaction experience. This is the classic case of getting what you pay for, and I think I did. The book was listed in ""good"" condition, but is falling apart at the binding (pages are falling out) but the print is clear despite the fact that it seems to be soaked with some kind of light oil or perfume (maybe spilled on it?). It would have helped if the seller mentioned this problem, but even at less than 1/10 the price of a new book, I might not have chosen to buy it if I knew this. There are only a few pages I needed from it anyway, and after xeroxing them I keep the book in a plastic baggie to contain the smell. I am satisfied with the amount I paid for this book."
3,Technical in nature - a bit out-of-date - Lacks CCD info,"Just getting back into the astrophotography after 15 years and found the book was a good refresher. It would be a good place to start with film photography. This title is almost 8 or 9 years old now, so the mentioned film types are dated, but the general concepts are good. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for a technical introduction into astrophotography. I will refer back to it often."
2,The book- Not the Diet,"I'm writing about the book itself, NOT about the diet. I feel the book is NOT worth the money. Unless you can gag-down all the self promotion that Suzanne does, please do yourself a favor and try another book! Every chapter is full of her telling us about her ""wonderful"" trips across the world, her ""beautiful and perfect"" family, endless bragging of her showbiz life (how LONG has it been since Three's Company's been on the air? ), ""Tacky"" photos of family outings, constant display of ""snubbiness"" (do we HAVE to hear how she likes to be served on her silver tray while resting on her silk sheets?), and to top this off Do you ever remember Suzanne Somers as FAT? Is the diet hers, or is she a paid spokesperson for this diet? It's basicaly the Atkins Diet only with some fruit added. I find her rumblings of herself takes away from the writings of the book. Get a life Suzanne- get over Three's Company's- stay with the imformerials- those we can turn off!"
1,same book over and over again,"I have read both of the schwartzybein books and suzanne sommers and all my friends agree with me when i say this, stop copying dr. atkins and get your own ideas. the same ideas are rehashed over and over again. dr schwartzybein writes a review in suzannes book and visa versa, are there both getting a profit from each others books?"
4,non starving diet,This has been the best weight control program that I have ever been on. It has been four weeks and I have lost 13 pounds and I am not starving. I am eating as much as I want of the appropriate foods until I am satisfied. I have got my sister and mother on the program and they have also lost weight. I have about ten more pounds to go and even if it takes three or four more weeks it is worth the weight because I finally feel like I can be on this forever. P.S. I have had cheated here and there at picnics but have not gone overboard and did not gain any weight.
5,"GREAT WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT, and easy too!","I was very skeptical when my sister explained the diet plan used in the book, but after Christmas my weight was at an all time high 201! (I am 5'10"" male). So I borrowed her book and started following the plan. I am now 176 lbs (LOST 25 lbs in 3 months!) and having a great time on this plan. The plan works and you still can eat and not starve yourself and still lose weight. I just had bacon, sausage and eggs for breakfast (but no toast or OJ). You eat what you want you just got to choose the right combinations. Easiest diet I've ever been on and I've been on a few."
3,"Update to Oct 15, 1999","Ok, so only 2 out of 7 people found my comments helpful. That's ok, but I guess I won't get the Amazon helpful reviewer award. Anyhow, I am now 136 pounds which is a loss of ten pounds to date. I have not been sticking to the diet very closely, but I have used some of its principles in my ongoing battle with excess weight. I made some of the recipes. I enjoyed the fritattas, but the chocolate cake recipe at the end of the book was downright awful. It tasted bad, turned to stone, and got thrown out. Another minor critisism: How can anyone bring themselves to use the word ""somersizing""? All in all though, I think that the book contains good advice. I will endeavor to follow the diet plan a little closer for the next ten pounds. I still have high hopes (and a few more clothes that fit)."
4,"Love the book, and starting soon",I have read the books through and love the program. I have just had a hard time with motivating myself into doing it. I am a sugar addict and that always messes me up. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to rid my sugar cravings? Please e-mail me with advice.
2,Too much focus on food and food preparation.,"This diet would be good for someone who has nothing else to do but spend all their time in the kitchen. To follow this diet, one must think about food and its preparation all day, every day. Deciding which food to eat or not to eat with another food is more than a busy person can handle. Suzanne Somers is a beautiful lady with a beautiful figure and was never REALLY fat. A person with a lot of pounds to lose would be wiser to find a life-time eating plan that is sensible and includes proper nutrition from all food groups in limited quantities. Bottom line: Calories do count!"
3,"Eat Great,Lose weight","I found the book very helpful, although I didn't start the diet yet. There are a few things that are unclear and it is very hard to find bread without some form of sugar in it.I was wondering what brand bread is used.If anyone out there knows I'd appreciate an email.Also there is no reference to ketchup in the book and besides making your own salad dressing is there one on the market that can be used.masu12@aol.com"
5,"Not a diet, a way of life!","I have been Sommersizing since January and can I tell you that this is the best 'change of eating habits' I have ever lasted through. It will work for any one. Once you get through the reprogramming of your eating style, you will become so relaxed with your new eating habits. I have added walking to my routine and the weight has dropped. Since I do not own a scale, I am not sure of my weight loss total. I can tell you that I have gone from a tight 14, sometimes even 16 to a loose 10! That's 3 sizes dropped, with little effort! I do cheat, on the weekends. I give myself a break on those days, and you know? I have never gone overboard. Go for it! You nothing but weight to loose?"
1,Moving on to something else in Ohio,"Sorry to tell you but it doesn't work. My mother and I tried it and it really does work to maintain your weight, but not lose it. At least it didn't work for the two of us. Everyone else GOOD LUCK."
2,Lose weight,"This book was a shock and yet a chuckle for our diet club. I bought it, thinking it was a regular size book, (guess I didnt read the small print) and when I received it, it was only 2"" big, however, I read it and she had some good ideas. The diet club had a chuckle but still enjoyed the suggestions she recommended."
3,Never been on a diet - Trying this for the first time,"I am trying this diet. It seems to have worked for many people. The only dieting I have ever done is attempting to skip meals. I want to lose at least 36 pounds. I am 5'1.5"" and I weigh 146 pounds. I just had a baby so that's the problem. I have always had a nice figure, and hate being this heavy. Sincerely Janetp.s. I'll update and let you all know how I'm doing. I want to succeed at this; I've got high hopes."
1,Too small to see let alone read,"How can one read a ""book"" and I use the term loosely when the print is so small. What a waste of money !!! Awful."
1,Flies in the face of other research,"If Dr. Dean Ornish's research is correct, this book is not only false in certain respects, it would be outright dangerous for some. According to her book, one can lower cholersterol by eating the fats one likes: cheese, sausages, etc. It even offers an illustration of an individual whose cholersterol was INCREASED by following what would amount to Dr. Ornish's plan featured in Newsweek a year or two ago. After having a borderline ECG treadmill test (lowered ST depressions at max) in September of 1998 with a HDL cholesterol at 30 and LDL at 159, I followed Dr. Ornish's advice and in 6 months the HDL was 33 (better but still not great) but the LDL was 113 (a drastic reduction of the bad cholesterol). I dropped 10 lbs. too. Somebody is right and somebody is wrong. Who is it?"
1,Healthy eating?,"For those that would like to believe this is a healthy way to eat, go for it. If you believe that we are a fat, unhealthy country because we eat too many carbohydrates and not enough meat, this book is for you. If you would just like to look at Somers' picture, buy it. But if you are overweight, have diabetes or one of many other problems related to diet, look elsewhere. We are being duped in this country-the message from people like Somers is overwhelming the truth. Be careful."
3,Terrible Sugar Withdrawal,"I was really excited when I saw this book, because I thought finally I could lose weight without using diet pills to curb my hunger. I have read this book at least 5 times since I ordered it last week, and finally started on the program last Saturday. I think it's a great book, it makes a lot of sense, but the only problem is, I am having terrible sugar withdrawals. Could someone please advise what to do? I really want to lose weight and I think everything sounds terrific, but without sugar I really feel terrible and I am having terrible headaches that I have to take my migraine medicine twice as often. I am eating lots of fruits and fruit smoothies with Equal, but it doesn't seem to help. Has anyone gone through the same thing? Would appreciate any comments. Thank you!"
3,Recipes Not Realistic,"I thought the book was well written and it probably works for some people, but the recipes were not realistically possible for someone like myself. I work and go to school, so I don't have time to cook any of those meals. My meals are on the go, so I need something that I can make put in a bag and not require heating it up. Have any suggestions?"
4,Ditto to Z. Anzelc,"Zoran Anzelc is absolutely correct about the similarity between Ms. Somers' book and M. Montignac's book; I have read both. He is a scientist and researcher; she is not, and in all probability, she must have borrowed from him. His book is worth reading as he allows CERTAIN carbohydrates with protein and lists those items in numerical order, indicating which are permissible. In fact, if one eats those carbohydrates with protein, the weight loss may be quicker as that interaction effects a quicker metabolism. Also an aside, not mentioned by either writer, but by Susan Roberts of Tufts University, ""adding fiber to low-fat diets can triple the weight you lose"" (water-based meals - soups, stews). Hope this is helpful."
2,"Right concept, wrong execution","I did this diet through the summer of 2002. Yes, I lost weight. Yes, I have since gained it back, and lost it again through other means.Pros:By eliminating refined sugars, carbs and other processed foods, she has the right idea of how to eat. This got me eating more veggies and fruits, while limiting processed foods considerably.Cons:Now that I'm older and wiser and have done research on how weight loss really works, I can tell you food combining and ""hormonal imbalances"" have nothing to do with it. It's calories in, calories out. From what I recall, she also puts little emphasis on the importance of exercise. It's nearly impossible to lose weight and keep it off without regular exercise.There are better ways to do this. I recommend The Eat Clean Diet, by Tosca Reno."
5,suzanne somer's get skinny on fabulous food,"I am on the Suzanne Somer's diet and i love it. I feel great and never get hungry. So far I have lost 4lbs., in two days. Some may be water weight, but i don't care, i love to see the pounds come off. I feel its going to work for me. I have 50 more lb's. to lose. Since i am a newbie, i would love to hear from others who are on her diet. My email address is: dcsaf@prodigy.net"
1,DIDN'T WORK FOR ME !,"Followed the diet exactly, ate more food than I ever have before for 4 weeks, looked better, but weight remained the same...think the low carb diet does dehydrate you, which makes you appear slimmer. Also, serious concerns over cholesterol levels."
1,"Nothing ,more than a spinoff from Fit For Life (same concept",This is the same info that Harvey Diamond wrote in Fit for Life about 14 yrs ago. Food combining was the main topic in his book. The only thing about Fit for Life not enough meat. At least Suzanne's book does allow a lot more meat and eggs.
3,I think the concept is exciting - but I have some questions!,"I read Suzanne's book (from the library) I did not buy it - I am a poor student! Anyway - I got the gist of the program. Food combining, eliminating funky foods, etc.I haven't had the awesome results I had anticipated - could I be eating too many grape-nuts with skim milk? They are such a simple breakfast and lunch! I eat them with Stevia and skim milk like she says. Do you think I should eat less for more weight loss?Does anyone have any advice on coffee drinking. I drink two cups of regular (black) coffee each morning - could this too be ruining my results?Also, can someone let me know where to find the Somerizing web-site! Thank you!"
3,sounds good not working for me,i was on alow fat healthy diet with only 10 lbs. to lose. this sounded great til i tried it and began gaining weight. my energy did increase with eglw but im gaining around the middle. yes i followed it exactly. afraid to give it more time than i have. 2 weeks. happyb for those with results. i gave it a 3 for content and stories.
4,Healthy concept that makes you feel great quickly.,"I think her concept is very good if you don't go crazy with the fat/meat allowance. This program is more like a ""lifestyle change"" than a diet. As a mother of two small children, I found the program easy to follow in a busy household. I liked her recipes, but think I would have enjoyed more family-oriented dishes. I lost eight pounds in the first three weeks and did not feel deprived or hungry. My family is all eating more whole grains and vegetables, a healthy change for all of us. I would have liked more health information in the book, and less vacation and family stories. Overall, it's a plan that is easy to follow and satisfying. I am thrilled that it has worked well for me! I welcome letters from anyone who would like to share support, recipe ideas, etc."
4,Helpful and Enjoyable,"This simple to follow and charming book allows people the freedom to eat a variety of foods while still losing weight. Somers is candid and humorous, which adds to the enjoyment of the reader."
4,Eat as much as you want.,"Sticking to the diet in the book I lost 35 lbs in five months. I find, interesting the fact that I can eat as much, or even more that I need as long as I keep the named proteins and carbs separate. This is the second copy of the book I have purchased and did so for my son and his family. He needs to lose about 20 pounds. I suggested that he follow the book suggestions very strickly and he should attain his goal."
4,It's slow,"I have been on the diet for two months and lost four pouns. I am 53 and on estrogen..so I know it's a sloow battle. I would appreciate any tips, hints or encouragement from anyone out there!"
3,I am stuck,"I am stuck. I have completely converted over to this way of eating and I love it. I feel better and have more energy. HOWEVER, I have been on the plan for 2 solid months. I have only lost 4.5 pounds. I run 2.5 miles 5-6 times a week not to mention rollerblading and tennis. I am stuck I can not lose anymore weight. I normally do not include breads or pastas in my diet any way or it is on a very rare occasion that I do. I have eliminated all the funky food and still nothing. I intend to continue eating this way only because I feel good, but as far as a weight loss program this is not the one. Does anyone have any suggestions as to get me unstuck?"
1,Sheila,"Was extremely disappointed in this book, i thought it was more updated then it was, when i received it not only was it an used book, which didn't know that is what i was paying for but it was a very old version of what she has written. was completely disappointed and put it in my stack to go the the Thrift store, not worth reading"
5,Good easy to follow eating plan,Since I turned 40 this is the only way for me to lose weight. I lost a pound a day in the first two weeks. The plan is easy to follow and the recipes are quite good and simple.
4,"Very motivating, easy to relate to, cant wait to start!","I am in my mid-thirties and never had to worry about calories, metabolism and fat grams. Well, as life has it...because of my invinsiblism to this, I have started to show the signs of my age and naiveity. I get bloated after eating a meal, or worse I get indigestion or acid reflux. The combining of foods seems like a way to not only relieve these symptoms, but loose alittle of the unwanted 'packaging' I've gotten! Suzanne's style of writing is very motivating and I can certainly relate to her stories. Can't wait to see and feel the results!"
2,"Eat ""Less"", Lose Weight","I was so excited to start this new way of eating and possible weight loss but only two days into it I felt light headed and weak. I can't imagine eating this way for life and actually enjoying it. After cutting out all the funky foods, you're left with eating sensibly(which most people already know that's how to lose weight), but it doesn't stop there! You have to disect the healthy stuff into meal combining and time schedules that left me feeling deprived. I felt too restricted and ended up eating too little. I must admit though, it did lead me to eating a little better and cutting out the junk. I've lost some weight but not from the food combining, just making better food choices! I give it two stars for inspiration to eat better. Good luck to those that make it work."
2,Buy it!,"Buy this book, now! First, it's inspirational. It makes you want to be healthy and fit. Second, it's easy to read and understand. Third, it's got great recipes...over half the book is recipes. This is how I want to eat for the rest of my life. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I respect the food I am eating. Can you relate to not respecting the food you put in your mouth? I take pride in the tasty, satisfying, healthy meals I prepare and NO MORE GUILT. Yeah!"
4,"don't buy this book, buy ""Get Skinny on Fabulous Foods ""","I bought both books, but the second one (Get Skinny on Fabulous Foods) had more recipies and a recap of the ""Eat Great, Lose Weight"". Along with the recap was some updated information. Get Skinny has all this book has and more. Save some money. The ""diet"" itself, however, is great! I've only been on it for 1 week, but I feel great! Never felt better."
5,"Great book for losing weight and...Yes, Entertaining!","I have read both books and have prepared several of the dishes and abolutely love them! I have been on the program only a short time but have really noticed a big difference! I highly recommend it! It is so easy to follow. You can also entertain guests using the guidelines and no one would ever complain! The Almond Tart and Creme Brulee are to die for! I also love the wonderful veggie dishes! My husband and the kids love these dishes. I have so many ideas for recipes and have altered many even from Bon Appetit to fit within the parameters of this program. I hope Suzanne Somers comes out with another book featuring many more of her recipes. Just think, you can eat like royalty and lose weight! Thank you Suzanne! Would anyone like some recipes?"
3,This works but.....,"Well, I bought and it does work!! I lost about 10 pounds within a month. The only problem is that this is not a diet. It is a lifestyle. You have to continue to eat like this!! No straying. That's just too much work for me. (What do you mean I have to wait two hours to eat fruit after eating! and I can't ever again eat carrots or corn)Once you do stray, the pounds creep back on. Instead, I joined Weight Watchers where you can eat whatever you want! I've been on the program for 6 weeks and I've lost 13 pounds. This is an easy plan that I can follow without a problem."
4,Rich Color and Sparkle,"Cake sparkles are intended to give just that; a bit of twinkling color. If used alone, the impact is subtle. If you want to enhance the effect, use them in conjunction with a purple or lavender color underneath. I use them with royal icing (it hardens) on cookies. After spreading the icing, immediately sprinkle the sparkles on top. The icing will hold them in place. The two layers create a beautiful, richer look. Think of a precious stone. Without being cut properly, the stone won't sparkle. But, with facets and light, it comes to life. That's what the cake sparkles do for your flat icing. I keep a supply of several colors and have never been disappointed with my finished products.This is not a product that you can taste. It's not sweet. Its purpose is to complement your baked goods, unlike sanding sugars or sprinkles/jimmies.Wilton consistently provides excellent quality supplies and I've been using their products for about 34 years."
3,Vibrant sparkles that don't add much sparkle.,"Like other reviewers have pointed out, these are not sparkles. They just add a little shimmer. The flakes are large, not glittery. No taste or crunch either. They just kind of fall on icing and look like really thin shards of glass. Not pretty, just shiny purple. My mother-in-law thought it was plastic that fell on the cupcake and was picking it off until I told her what it was. Not very impressive!"
2,Nice color but not so sparkly,"Purchased this lavender sugar to put on lavender sugar cookies. The cookies were great, but the lavender shgar wasn't that sparkly. I was looking for edible glitter; this is not it."
1,NOT BLACK!!!,"These sprinkles looked black in the container, which says ""Black Sugar"" on it, but I was annoyed to find that they are very green. They are definitely hunter green sprinkles. I took a random poll of members of my household and 3 out of 3 confirmed (with no prompting or leading questions from me besides ""What color are these sprinkles?"") that these are undoubtedly green."
3,Not very sparkly,"These sparkles made my cake look great, but were not what I was expecting. The picture led me to believe that they were sparkly but they really just looked like black opaque crystals."
4,The Autobiography of Malcolm X was a...,Great book. Prose is easy to read and understand. All around a must read for college and high school students alike.
5,Read this book and you will acquire knowledge you need as a human being,"This book was recommended by my co-woker, and from when I picked up the book I was unable to drop it until I was done reading. It tells the story of man who never limited himself and continued learning and acquiring wisdom until death. There is wisdom in this book, appreciation for life, and admiration for the brave once who were not afraid to make mistakes, admit it, and still not compromise the important principles of life. Rest in Peace to the Great El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz."
5,"The Socrates of the slums, in a good way","As a white dude and a non-Muslim, I would like to say that Malcolm X dedicated his life for the betterment of his people. He was a student of life, had an open mind, and was always learning. Too bad that the racist society had limited some of the innate potential he possessed for which we would have done even greater deeds had he been given the opportunity. He was like Socrates, engaging, challenging his fellow people to stand up, to see the situation that they were in, and to demand one's rights. America really lost a giant when he was murdered.I found it inspiring how he educated himself during his time in prison. Malcolm X got more education in his time in prison that I got in my 6 years in the navy, which looking back I admit was a complete waste of time.May he always be remembered and his spirit lives on. If you haven't done it, read the book, it reads quick and hard to put down. You'll be glad you did.Enjoy!"
3,Interesting look inside a famous man,"I thought I wanted to read this book for about 8 years now, but just started last month and didn't read every day. I liked it. I think because it was Malcolm X's real words. Alex Haley explains how he was told the story through the years and he doesn't change what it said even after he comes back from Mecca and changes his beliefs.Reading this book made me want to go back and do more research on the Civil Rights Movement. Malcolm X was controversial, but he did make people sit up and listen."
3,Pages Fall out,"As I starting to read the book's introduction, the pages began to fall out of the book. I am on the 80th page and approx 20 pages have fallen out. Good luck. Book is great though."
3,Pleased,"I was a little disappointed with Malcolm X's Autobiography. Although the book shipped quickly and arrived between the 7-14 day window, it's a different version than the one seen in the picture. The book is in good condition like it stated. Overall, I was pleased with the service and quickness."
4,Excellent Read,I gave this book to my 15 year old daughter. This is a history that is slowly fading away in our society. It is so important that young people have a chance to understand the foundation of this country and the people who came before them to pave the way to a freer society.
2,Poor,"It arrived on the estimated time but the book's cover was torn and falling apart. And while it was not missing any pages, not having a proper cover made me have to be extra cautious while reading the book. The only reason why I did not return it was because I really needed it for schoolwork."
1,Weak,"I just listened to this CD and after the first two songs which are OK, the rest seems to be a lot of filler. There are better ways to occupy your time than trying to get into this group."
4,Excellent!!!,"This is one of my all time favorite bands (along with the Judybats, Gene l/s Jezebel, and Slowdive). This album is not as fierce as their other three, but still emerges with great emotion and feeling. Very inspiring in a way. All 4 albums are excellent!"
4,most solid,"Probably their best album. Poetic lyrics, atmospheric guitar. This is a late night/rainy day soundtrack for when you're feeling blue-gray."
4,"My favorite ""otherworldly"" sounding band","Gee it's too bad that most of the Kitchens of Distinction catalog has so quickly gone out of print in the U.S. and can only be found as imports (pricey) or the used bins. The band has an instantly recognizable and ethereal 'otherworldly' sound. COWBOYS contains some nicely written tunes, but the group's best album in my opinion is STRANGE FREE WORLD (A&M from 1990). Let's hope this album and the Kitchens' 1992 follow-up, THE DEATH OF COOL (also on A&M), will be available again soon."
5,What my dad used to play on his 'record box',"For nostalgia's sake, I wanted to hear 'Satin Doll'--and I felt that it wasn't enough. One of the last of the great song stylists, Nancy Wilson deserves to be played over, and over and over to get the full effect. A great voice."
4,Honest scholar,"While many biblical scholars had published researches that incur the wrath of fundamentalists, Friedman's book has received mostly positive reviews, even from the fundamentalists. The author has displayed great humility, sincerity and restrain in this book, and I surmise these qualities are what set him and his work apart from his peers."
5,"Along with Burton Mack ""Who wrote the NT""","I use this excellent and manageable text along with Burton Mack's treatment of the NT as handy sources to review prior to discussions on Biblical topics. This book in particular was recommended to me by a colleague after my ""Book of J"" disappeared during a class. (It took a while before I got another copy). My colleague recommended this as a better book and in many respects I agree with her. I still like the poetry in ""The Book of J"" but the analysis by Friedman is excellent and easily led me on to his other books."
3,"Good Book About the ""Good Book,"" and a Recommendation","Friedman's ""Who Wrote the Bible?"" is a good book that explores the documentary hypothesis quite well. It is easy to read and interesting. However, a more compelling and convincing argument about the authorship of the first book of the Bible can be found in ""The Genius of Genesis"" by Dennis Shulman. Read both of these books if you want a more balanced perspective on the questions Richard Friedman and the modern biblical scholars raise."
3,Good Information,"This book is informative but maybe too detailed in some aspects, description, etc. I found myself doing a lot of scanning looking for real information."
5,One of the Best!,"If you are searching for readable, solid scholarship that will help you get a handle on critical insights of the Hebrew Bible (sadly, too often called the ""Old"" Testament), Friedman's book will be a priceless resource for you. Step by step, the author walks his readers through a series of chapters that offer background and insights into the sources and environment that produced the Hebrew scriptures. For Jews and Christians alike, this book is a must. If there are still too many details about the development of the Hebrew Bible that just won't come clear for you, the clarity and organized thinking of this fine volume will prove to be an amazing benefit."
5,Eye opener,One of the best books I've read in a long time. Friedman has the ability to make obscure subject seem fascinating. A must for any serious Bible student.
5,Now I understand the battle of the trees--,"I earn my living as a social scientist but I have a strong background in biological science. My reading has included scientific works by Strauss, Needham, Mauss, and others--and I read the Golden Bough by Frazier and the White Goddess by Groves when I was in graduate school. When I read Friedman's ""Hidden Book in the Bible"", then ""Who Wrote the Bible"" and then to the ""Disappearance of God"" I experienced a flood of illumination. Then I read ""Noah's Flood"" and had another flash of insight. A year or so ago I was visiting the John Muir Woods north of San Francisco. As my son and I walked through the magnificent redwoods, he asked me why I was whispering. I said, ""Because this is a cathedral."" I mentioned this to my friend who is Nez Perce. She said, ""Yes."" Now I see through a glass darkly."
1,Deer Off 2.5 Gal. Concentrate,"Ordered from UnbeatableSale, Inc, the very expensive (almost $300 for 2.5 Gal) Deer Off is constantly plugging up the sprayer. I had to discard 2 sprayers because I could not clear them even with a reverse flow from a compressor. I noticed the hardware store has a ready-to-use spray with a ""new formula"". It has a stronger smell and a different consistency. My container looks like someone added some grits to it. Very disappointed. UnbeatableSale, Inc did not respond to my feedback."
2,Didn't seem to help at all,"I used this product on half of my roses and left the other half without anything. Literally a day after application both of my sets of roses were eaten by the deer. I think the deer are going to eat my roses no matter what, but I won't spend money on this stuff anymore."
3,Deer Off,This has been our number one choice for keeping deer from eating plants for years. Only 1 complaint through all those years is that it clogs spayers way to easily. Well that and the cost.
3,Not impressed much,"This guys flow is not that good, at times it's unbearable. His beats are OK for the most part, but I just did not feel this CD. He has clever wordplay I will give him that much at least."
1,Cooking in the Nude is nothing more than a misleading title,"I ordered this book with high expectations which were quickly dispelled after opening the book. I guess the title is justified by a mild twist on words(ie. ""Appeteaser"") becuase I find no other reason for it. However, the fact that this piece of garbage(which I returned so minus one of those) has sold over 400, 000 copies has motivated me to wrie my own book. Thanks."
1,Bad,"I have had this screen for about a year and a half now. And even though it was fairly problem free in the beginning, right now as i'm writing this it has lost over 50% of its brightness, the refresh rate even though it still says 60 I am 100% sure it has fallen below to. The screen is slightly blurry.First I thought it was the cable, so I got a new cable. Now that I finally know its not that, and the screen is just messed up. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS SCREEN TOO ANYONE"
5,Great Value,"I just purchased the Mitsu NXM76LCD from Surplus Max, and I am very satisfied with this LCD. At 400.00 this is truely a great buy. We have played some games on this monitor and there is absolutely no problems. The monitor has a great response time. We are using the d-sub connection. This LCD also has a digital hook up as well.The only draw back is the 1 year warantee, which you can buy from NEC."
3,Disk won't work.,"Thomas Guide is the best in maps, but the disk that is included will not work with the new Vista operating system."
4,Three well-written short stories,"I picked up this book at the recommendation of a local librarian. Although they are written for a young adult audience -- and two of the stories center on young adults -- these stories are well-written enough to appeal to anyone who enjoys a well-crafted story. Although actual dates and places aren't given, all three stories seem to take place in the 17th - 19th centuries, two in New England and one in Italy, and a statue figures in each; hence the title of the collection.Recommended as a nice, short intermission between other books."
3,This book was Graven Images was good!,"This book Graven Images was good! In this book there are three stories. My favorite story out of all of these is the ""Binnacle Boy"". The ""Binncle Boy"" is about a boy who dies in a ship reck. There are not alot of pictures in my book but I still thought it was a good book."
4,Well writen stories about morals everyone can use,"This book was a pleasure to read. It was easy to understand. There was no violence and it had many morals we can all use. For example ""don't be 'nitpickey' about things."
4,After listening try not feeling like you can overcome!,"More an experience than a CD. The band here is crunching away, fighting back, and still has time for lasting humour in tracks like ""Je Declare."" The band has better CD's but this one's intensity, both lyrically and musically, from start to finish cannot be matched."
1,Great movie. Terrible dvd quality. DO NOT BUY!,This movie is great. Great characters. Great music. Great dancing. It's very entertaining and funny.BEWARE!! The dvd quality is absolutely horrific. This dvd is a copy. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE FROM AMAZON! Please find a better quality dvd elsewhere! The picture was pixelized for most of the movie and the sound cut out during parts in the beginning. It is recorded off the TV from Eros International so there are commercial breaks and advertisements on the screen during the movie. It was very annoying.
1,great film -- amazon copy not so great,"Hindi High School Musical with terrorists -- in fact terrifically charming, though many will want to fast-forward through the gratuitous, sometimes cartoonish, belabored violence towards the end. This film belongs in every bollywood home library -- it includes director/choreographer Farah Khan's characteristic wit throughout (and that's especially clever during dance sequences), some fun and memorable songs, a very strong cast, and what is admittedly a rather silly, strained meta-plot that still manages to generate a sweet and sometimes even moving film.What I wish I had known before purchasing? that the Amazon copy sold to me was a pirated dvd with painfully obvious bootleg qualities -- occasional bad pixilation, etc. Buyer beware..."
1,Don't Buy!,"This is a bootleg version of the movie! Don't buy it! Amazon probably didn't know that it wasn't a proper version, so I don't blame them. Buy it from Eros, the original production company- it's definitely worth it!"
1,Couldn't see anybody's faces...poor quality DVD!!,"We have bought many things from amazon and never had any issues with any item until now. The print is very bad and we couldn't see anybody's faces especially during songs. Amazon, please check with the merchant and make sure they are shipping quality DVDs and not the pirated ones!."
2,"Fantastic movie, bootlegged dvd","Poor quality, bootlegged DVD. That's too bad. The movie itself was very funny, thought. I would suggest researching where you're buying from, which I'll be doing next time."
3,not bad,I first heard this back in 95. Not a bad cd. Too bad I never heard any thing more from this artist. Her voice is pleasant and somewhat Faith-ish.
5,Best Toner and Makeup Remover!,"I have used this product for years and years, it is one of the few things I buy over and over. The scent is wonderful - light and rosy. It removes even the most diva of eye makeup and leaves my skin feeling fresh."
3,Good product for small pollen particles,Much better than a regualr store bought skimmer. Gets the smallest particles that flow through a normal store bough skimmer.
4,A good read; made me want a sequel,"I enjoyed Deep Structure very much. Many of us could identify with Gatsby, the main character. We are all capable of much more than we will ever believe and that is exactly what keeps us from reaching our greatest potential -- even when it stares us right in the face. Deep structure is seeped in mystery and the paranormal. I really would like to see a sequel as it leaves one wanting more."
4,Try and get past the cover art...,"...because this is a great album.I always thought Dupree was a sort of icky ""smooth jazz"" artist, and worthy of little but scorn. My mistake.One of my new favorite hobbies is buying ""lots"" of used CDs on eBay.com and plowing through the random inclusions. This is how I came upon this disc.I would be hard pressed to call this jazz. ""Can't Get Through"" really plays like jazzy acoustic blues; a little more produced than good blues, a lot less sterile than most contemporary jazz.Let's rename this album ""What if Muddy Waters were still alive, feeling frisky and played with a jazz quartet."" I think that covers it.Not broody blues, but not ""smooth jazz"" either. Good driving tunes."
1,if you have enough money you can build the house you want,"All this proves is that ""ski style"" is ANYTHING you want to build in a ski area. Some of the places have no ""ski"" feel at all."
4,Great CIA novel,I have read all of Mr. Buckley's novels and find them to be riveting and insightful. The details seem to be true to life and it gives an interesting twist to modern history.
4,"A good Oakes novel, entertaining dual story line","While not the best Blackford Oakes novel, it's readable with a moderate amount of suspense -- not necessarily about what will happen (real-life history already contraindicates the potential of the main plot line about Gorbachev), but about why it didn't happen. A nice touch is the decade-wide dual story line with Oakes being called to testify in 1995 about the events of 1986. Characterization in the Soviet story line is a tad light; too many of the characters in the 1986 thread appear interchangeable. But it's a pleasant, fast read in the series."
3,"Poetic, episodic, but no real story line","While the writing is beautiful, the oft-alluded-to mystery gets lost in the many characters and anecdotes that make up the bulk of the ""novel."" This isn't really a novel, it's a memoir, thus the inconclusiveness of the ending. That's fine, but why call it a novel? Too much ruminating about the family agony; by the end I simply didn't care."
2,Great Expectations,"I had high hopes for this book, only because it won a few awards, but it didn't take long to be discouraged. I didn't like the short divisions between chapters; it made it all too confusing. The plot could have been made into a good one, but it seems as though the author threw in a lot of nonsense that had nothing to do with the ending. It seems as though the book actually started midway through the novel. Perhaps I just needed more of an Irish backround to fully enjoy the story/memoires that this book talks about."
4,"Grim and Charming, Funny and Sad","Seamus Deane has added another fine book to the amazing collection of novels looking at Ireland and the Irish in the twentienth century. The most delightful and charming aspect of Reading in the Dark is the voice of its unnamed narrator as he struggles to understand the world he is growing up in (Northern Ireland in the 1950's). Every situation can have so many solutions to him, some mundane, most wondrous. It is surprising how much humour can be found in the life led by this boy, as written by Mr. Deane. The wit of the writing helps cushion the reader for all the very many sadnesses and horrors which occur throughout the book. The reader and the narrator will together learn to navigate this world and survive. An effective and powerful read."
5,Cultúir Fásta,"Fascinating mixture of Irish tales,Northern Ireland political situation, religion and as well a growth story of a young man. Deane takes no sides in the war, but describes the feelings and emotions behind scenes quite well..."
4,A well written read if you give it time.,"I just finished ""Reading in the Dark."" I'm a great fan of Irish authors and Seamus Deane did not disappoint me. The story is very well written and the further along into the book you go, the more engaging it becomes. As a warning, do not begin this book thinking that it will be reminiscent of Frank McCourt's ""Angela's Ashes."" Should you do so, you will be disappointed and lose appreciation for a distictly different book. Stick with it; it is worth it, if for nothing else but for the imagery."
4,Excellent writing with a full command of human emotion.,"This is a truly inspired book which transcends its Irish setting. Although achingly sad, the reviews do not do the book's humour justice. The chapter on the maths lesson is a masterpiece of surreal humour. There is also no bitterness in this tale despite the tragedy."
1,Has no substance.,"Reading this book it is clear the author is originally and more naturally a poet. His lyrical style did not translate well to prose and as a result this book is boring and slow. I always finish a book I start, but it was pure torture to finish this one. After the story line finally develops it turns out to be so trivial it is not even worth mentioning. Poetry doesn't have to have a story line prose must have one and this book doesn't. On to something more interesting to read, like the dictionary."
5,Absolutely beautiful!,"I read this book for a class, and it was truely one of the best books I've ever come across, (it made me cry- no small accomplishment)! At first sight I was worried it might be a rip off of Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, but not at all. It was fresh and had a totally diffrent feel, almost like poetry. I encourage everyone to read this, Irish or not, because everyone can understand the narrator's struggle. Truely a beautiful read."

1,"This is a Pamphlet, not a Book.","If you want to learn about U-Boats pass this one up. What you end up with is a cleverly marketed first half of a small booklet. I was enfuriated to see that I have to buy the second volume just to end up with what is a 100 plus page pamphlet on U-Boats for twenty five dollars all told after purchase.Osprey does well in presenting targeted overviews of certain subjects but they are starting to carry this marketing strategy to an extreme. I have seen enough of this now with other Osprey titles that I have this advice for would be book buyers: If it says NEW VANGUARD somewhere on the cover...pass on it. If its an ""Osprey"" publication, get a good look at it before you buy and make sure its not part of one of their ""series"" ploys first."
1,Save your money!!,"Poorly written, narrow-minded and vague, this book is a total waste of paper. Let me sum it up in one sentence: Find something wrong with you, blame your ancestors, pray to God for forgiveness for stuff you didn't do, and you're as good as cured. I have a feeling a little silver is also expected to cross the palm of the religious representative who is acting as your ""hotline to God."" Ridiculous."
1,Beware. Printer is faulty.,"The printer is rarely used. Only printed a few documents over several months. We never put off-brand ink in it. It's almost new. It gets the Ink Cartridge error mentioned by others that it does not recognize it has a cartridge in the black slot. Also, is says I have TWO of the same color cartridges installed. I don't. So now it won't print anything. It's a like-new printer with full ink cartridges that are totally useless to me. This will FOR SURE be my last Canon printer, and maybe my last Canon product. Their website offers no help, and no firmware updates. The customer should have some recourse against Canon for this kind of issue. Many people have the same problem with the printer. It should be recalled and replaced. DO NOT buy this printer."
4,Excellent looking and printing,"I have had mainly Epson printers starting with the 760 and 770 series and was happy with them. Then when I bought my iMac it came with an Epson C86 that was noisy and ended up dying after about a year. It also looked horrible, like a plastic bubble. I then wanted to try Canon as I have always been a Canon camera user and found someone selling an unopened i6600D. After owning now for about 6 months the looks and quality of the prints compared to the C86 is much better. Build quality is much better. The printer is also very quite. Sometimes I can't even hear it printing. Overall I am very pleased with the i6600D and will stick with Canon."
4,Check for ink,"Once you decide on the quality of printer you like, one of the first things to do is check on the ink cartridges. Replacement cartridges can run into big bucks, especially if the printer only takes 2 tanks and you have to replace the entire color one even if only one of the colors run out. This printer uses multiple tanks, which is good, BUT I could find no generic/compatible cartridges available for it yet. Try looking on the web for the CLI-8 cartridges and see how much they cost. The other Canon Pixma's like the 6000 have compatible cartridges that are available very cheap, so watch your wallet when considering this product."
2,CARTRIDGES DO NOT LAST LONG AND ARE TOO EXPENSIVE,"Considering the number of individual color cartridges in this printer, I expected a much higher quality print. The colors do not seem any better than my old HP printer, and that printer only had a tri color and black cartridge. It also cost much less. The cartridges do not last long and are quite expensive. Recently, I experienced two clogs in the print heads.Long story short, I'd gladly sell this printer, but do not recommend it."
1,Way too expensive per print,Please do yourself and your wallet a favor-buy another printer besides the Canon i6600D. The inks are very expensive and the amount of ink in each cartridge is so small you will be replacing them every other week. Canon wont let the consumer purchase alternative ink cartridges so they charge huge prices for each one. I wish I had read this review before I bought my printer.
3,wheres the ink?,"Got this printer from Amazon about a week ago now, we are very impressed with the photo prints and features but it seems that Canon is not willing to lose the big money by allowing cartridges out on the market. I'm afraid that we will run out of ink before we can find a reasonably priced source for canon ink!"
4,Compatible Ink Tanks for iP6600D,"Just today I ordered the 6600D online to replace my old Canon S900 (great printer!), which used the Canon BCI-6 line of ink tanks. Part of my decision to buy this printer was that I spoke with a Canon rep on the phone who told me that the 6600D will take the S900's ink tanks. Just before my S900 crapped out I had ordered 18 BCI-6 compatible ink tanks from an online site and I didn't want to have to just get rid of them. Besides, I have always liked the idea of changing out individual color tanks--more economical. I believe the tanks for the 6600D have been renamed CLI-8, but as I said, according to the Canon rep, the BCI-6 tanks will work! And they can be found cheap on any online ink supply site. We shall see . . . I'll post again to when I find out. I don't even have my new 6600 yet--I had to rate this item before submitting this review--so I just chose 4 stars randomly."
3,Canon PIXMA iP6600D,"The print quality of the Pixma is fine--I have no complaints. But the reason I downrated this model is because the manufacturer has gone to extreme lengths to prevent the user from using any inks other than their own. My previous Canon, i960, allowed the use of generic inks. We all know WHY the companies do this. Frankly, it would be more honest to ask more for the machine & let us use whatever ink we prefer. But, hey, this is America, & it'll never happen."
2,Do not buy this printer,"This printer does not always work. The printer will either not recognize an ink cartridge, or indicates that there is more than one of the same cartridge even though there is not. The cartridges do no last long and are expensive.If, and that is a big if, you can the printer to work it prints fine.I would strongly suggest you purchase another printer."
4,Durable and nice printer,"I use this in production and probably put 8000 sheets of various wait paper through it in a year for greeting cards and it never stops. Would be nice to have auto duplex, but that is why I have two set up, one doing each side to keep production rolling. Recommend."
2,Nice Print Quality But Awful Construction,"I've had this for about 2 years now. Print quality is excellent. Chassis of printer is flimsy. Paper sheet feeder not designed well as it allows the paper to shift sideways when being pulled in which makes the printing on the page crooked at times. Also, got an Error 5100 which could not be cleared even though I did everything recommended by the service manual to fix the problem. Printer is now dead. Check out a cheap color laser instead."
2,Print Quality Is Mediocre,"I received this iP 6600D printer about a week ago to replace my malfunctioning Canon i9900, and I am very disapointed. The print quality on the i9900 was excellent, but the print quality of the 6600D is mediocre at best. Specifically, the colors are really washed out, particularly the reds, but all are to some extent. The colors are also not as true to life as they should be. For example, the mountains in a photo I used for comparison purposes looked too blue rather than as green as they should have been. The quality is also inferior to some prints I obtained from a drugstore photo printer. Before you buy this photo printer (or any photoprinter, really) you should have some digital photo examples printed on photo paper and compare them to the same photos printed on the printer you are considering. It really sucks working to take good photos and then knowing the quality of the resulting photos in your photo album will be less than they should be."
1,Serious red tone problem,"I'm a Canon fan. I bought this printer as a replacement for an old Canon i850. Brand-new, out-of-the-box, the 6600d produced photos with an annoying red cast. Photos would require a lot of guess-work in post processing to reduce the red so the prints would come out correct. Most of the time, this 'correction' caused photos to have a green tint, so you'd have to go back and try again. Totally unacceptable. An internet search turned up a number of owners who experienced the same red cast problem.I returned the 6600d and bought an Epson R320 which produces much better prints with no additional work. For the record, my monitor is color calibrated, and the red cast happened regardless of what photo editing software I used to print my work."
2,Red color problem,"The photo output of this printer is really quite good except for one GLARING problem - the overwhelming redness of flesh tones. A lot of pictures of the baby are coming out like he's scalded or badly sunburned. This leads to a tremendous waste of paper and ink, not to mention effort in trying to adjust for this problem. Even a call to Canon TS didn't solve anything. Apparently, I'm not the only one with this problem. I would love to return this printer if I could... Too bad I stocked up on a bunch of Canon paper already. Any suggestions for a fix (besides the usual calibration, red tone slider, etc.)? I would love to try the MP series, but this experience has really soured me on Canon printers (I love their digital cameras though - bought 3 within the last year).My Epson 300 and even the 3810 perform much better with good picture output all-around."
3,Very nice but....................,"This printer does a nice job and prints out very good photos, but, if you alter or enhance your photos with photoshop and then try to save them to disk and print then it will not work. You must only be able to do your editing in the printer, not a convenient way to do editing. Overall I would give it a 3 out of 5 due to lack of editing ability."
3,canon printer,when i was shopping for the printer i put the old printer with the compatable inks i still have the printed was on the list. but the inks were not compatable.
3,what ever happen to her,"Best kept secert in the 90's. Album went gold,never heard or saw from her. Turn it up was the sh*t"
5,Supertrapp Megaphone,"What I hoped for and more, nicely made and finished. Fit the 2 inch head pipe perfectly, really like the Supertrapp adjustable configuration baffles. These replaced other after market mufflers and made my 1985 Vmax a pleasure to ride again, a lot less noise and still real decent performance."
2,Awesome Actors Gone to Waste,"With Gary Busey and Arnold Vosloo starring and a great story idea, how could this movie go so wrong? Simple. With a script that can't live up to its full potential and weak directing that leaves these talented and charismatic actors with egg on their faces.Throughout this movie, lines are forced and emotional outbursts come flying out of nowhere. At times the actors are left to grope for a connection, or worse, they are made to violate their instincts, turning powerful moments into awkward ones.Like harpies from the sky, these senseless moments make the viewer want to run screaming for shelter. What seemed like a promising thriller of intrigue and insanity turned out to be a disappointing groaner of missed marks and flat presentation.It's always a shame when such awesome actors have been wasted, but they say that any experience is a good one if you learn a valuable lesson. I sincerely hope so, but I want to know ""Is it too early to do a re-make?"""
2,A Poor Man's Psychological Thriller ...,"Sad to see such wasted talent as Arnold Vosloo (who is horribly miscast as a far too attractive and far from menacing serial killer) in this unfortunate excuse for a psychological thriller. If, like me, you have recently become a fan of this sexy and darkly intense actor since this summer's mega-hit ""The Mummy"", you will be pleased at the amount of screen time and dialogue he has but sorely disappointed if you are a fan of the psychological thriller genre. Gary Busey seems to sleepwalk through the movie when any other journalist would likely be traumatized at being stalked by a serial killer. More interviews with the killer would have provided more insight into this character. Lots of potential for an interesting study of the mind of a killer, but somebody missed the boat on that one. In short, if you're a Vosloo fan, give it a look but if you're a psychological thriller movie fan, give it a definite pass!!!"
2,DIARY-EA,"Gary Busey and Arnold Vosloo star in this lukewarm thriller, diminished by a pedestrian script and its failure to really be a ""diary"". We don't really find out why Vosloo does what he does. While Vosloo's performance is effectively chilling, Busey is horribly miscast. His journalist role is weakly performed, and little conviction is evidenced in his relationship with Vosloo or his live in girl friend (the lovely Julia Campbell). Add Michael Masden (B movie's Bruce Willis) as a cop whose daughter was killed by a serial killer and Reno Wilson as his obligatory African American partner, and the soup thickens. Masden sleepwalks and Wilson tries to be Ice T. Wilson's actions at the end of the movie are highly unprofessional and hard to swallow.This could have been a better movie with a tighter script and someone else in Busey's role."
2,For Vosloo fan only,"I rented this just to see Arnold Vosloo. He looks great, but the movie is dumb. I'm not a horror fan, so I can't compare this film to others in the genre, but the story is pretty weak. And Gury Busey is fat and sluggish in his role (literally and figuratively). I couldn't believe how weak his character is... especially in the scene where he stands there and evespdrops during a murder. I kept shouting ""do something!"". Even Arnold loses his edge sometimes when the script calls for him too talk to much... sometimes less is more. But if you are a Vosloo fan, you can't miss this one."
1,a waste of time,I had high hopes for this... I was expecting a fun light read for the pool. But this book really disappointed me. It was completely unbelievable and just riduculous. I gave up about two thirds of the way through... not worth my time. I have no idea how some people gave it high ratings. It was one of the worst books I have read in a really long time.
4,I love this pen,"I've been a Waterman fan all of my life, but I was given this Mont Blanc at my last job as a going-away present. The pen is wonderful. I use it every day and it feels great. The ink flows beautifully, and it fits perfectly in the hand with a nice balance. I highly recommend it..."
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE,not a Mont Blanc. Fell apart. Do Not Buy This Pen. Not even a good replica. A total waste of money.
4,good product but engravment voucher removed,good product god condition but the engravment voucher was removed from the box before shipping
4,Newer Waylon,"i have this album...from 1992...it's good but i prefer old Waylon from the 70's...mainly Lonesome On'ry and Mean, Are You Ready for the Country?, the Ramblin' Man, theTaker/Tulsa, Wanted-the Outlaws, and I've Always Been Crazy"
3,Oliver's Mom,"We bought this bath mat for my son when he began taking baths in the bathtub. It serves its purpose but the suction cups usually don't stay suctioned to the tub. It's frustrating because every night I have to reapply it. That being said, it was affordable and probably works as well as any of the other mats."
4,This is programmers dream.,Visual Basics is a dream come true for the game programmer. I thought it was very enlightening and thoroughly read and understood it. I rate it as a superb learning experience.
3,Foggy morning..,I use this product for anti-fog on shop glasses and swimming goggles. It seems to do the trick and was priced right.I cannot comment on how well it controls rage.
1,does not work at all!,"just get urself a thermal goggle, this is just a 2 oz bottle of distilled water."
4,No Problems Yet,I live in NJ and the humidity is intense here during the summer months. I use this product instead of a regular lens cleaner to help my glasses from not fogging up. I haven't had a problem associated to my glasses fogging up as of yet.
3,"Decent product, Check before you install","This switch arrived quickly, looks great and was easy to wire. On the bad side of things, it did not work properly. In the middle position it did not make connection with both contacts. easily fixed by bending the contacts, but a pain to pull back out of the guitar after everything was wired and I was ""done"" with the project."
2,Just Okay.Not Great,"I should have fondled it at the store before I ordered it on-line. My biggest complaint about this product is how the clipper is attached by plastic. It looks like over time it may break. Also the knob you press/pull to extract the clipper is also the key chain ring.(so I can see clipper accidently being pulled out when there is tention on the keychain ring. I think it's a bit big to attach to your keys. 2.5 inches long and 3/4 inches width. also the twizer and toothpick is facing down when attached to key ring so I wonder if I will end up loosing it. Time will tell. Good points are, it is very light weight, coming it at 1.4 oz. Clippers it self seems to function very well. I had no problem clipping my nails with it. this product is just okay. I'll keep it but I wouldn't recommend this product."
5,Great sturdy puzzle,"I can't believe there aren't more reviews on this puzzle. This is a great learning puzzle for the alphabet and different professions. My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves puzzles and this one was the perfect addition to our growing collection. The pieces are very thick, even holding up to my 14 month old son. The inner puzzle is a neighborhood with different shops and buildings, and moves separately from the outer puzzle with the alphabet and professions. The little neighborhood can even lead to discussion about the different places around town - an added bonus.This is definitely a unique puzzle and is worth adding to your collection!"
2,Missing puzzle piece,There was a missing piece when the giftee tried to put it together. That's not good for a little child as they like to complete their projects. Very cute puzzle otherwise.
5,Recomended!,This is a great and easy puzzle! My son loves it! so many thing to discus and learn on this puzzle! Would definitely recommend this puzzle!
5,great,my son really love it! enjoy it to put it together and he is learnign the abc! is a big help to learn the alphabet.
4,not bad puzzle,Not bad puzzle at all. Another way to learn all the ABC's. I didn't find the pieces too soft and we can build it perfectly on our carpet. Another nice addition to our puzzle collection;)
1,The Horror Is That This Was Made,"This movie is a shocker and should be avoided. It has a weak script, poorly acted and the visual effects would easily be surpassed by any child with six months experience on a computer. To say that it is amateurish is a gross understatement.I bought my copy after reading excellent reviews on Amazon.UK and thought it was worth a look at. I have seen the movie twice now because I couldn't believe how bad it was the first time round, not because I'm a glutten for punishment. My judgement stands that it is absolute rubbish. I regret having spent my hard earned money on the item and hope those that apprecieate movies made to a reasonable standard will heed my words and give this movie a wide birth."
4,Southwest Culture gets a historical perspective in this book.,"Tracing the indigenous tribes of mezoamerica and the conquest of the southwest by the Spaniards sheds a historical and accurate accounting by Edward Spicer. Details and maps provide an overall picture of the movement of culture that shaped the southwest and south America and the blending of Native American, and European cultures."
5,He's Just a Friend by Mary B. Morrison,"He's Just a Friend is a fabulous read. It starts off with a bang and hooks you right into the lives of Fancy, Desmond, and SaVoy. It's a page turner and gives the word friend a new meaning. This is a beautiful book and I would highly recommend it."
3,She needs help!,I actually felt sorry for Fancy. It's quit obvious she grew up in a defective household so she only did what she could do best sack chase. She obviously didn't know what a good man was. Dez was a good man. Hopefully the next installment of this series will let her find true love and happiness. At the end of the book she did have a change of heart. She decided not to give herself up so easily anymore. Maybe she'll change Darius' Jones heart and help him be a better person.
4,this women can do know wrong,"to be honest thier was a couple of thing's I didn't like about the book like what was up with fancy and her mom? and i didn't really like the ending, but i know this women's history and i have grown to love her unconditionally. I think afther she wrote soul mates dissapate and never agian once more that was i't for me."
3,Disappointed at the end,Over all this book was good.Fancy was a trip and i was really hoping this sista would get it together and maybe got together at the end with her friend.After i finish reading this book i was disappointed because the ending didn't have a true meaning to it.Fancy was still doing her thing.They show SaVoy character very ignorant and dumb and i would like to see more of Fancy mom character.
5,"Mary, Mary, Mary!","I read an excerpt of this book off Mary's site and knew this was going to be one of my ""must reads"". I was pleasantly surprised to find that what I thought I knew was waaaay off. Mary did an outstanding job with the complexities of her characters and had me tearing up pages 'til the very end. I read this book in 1 day & can see why this book is flying off store shelves."
4,He's Just a Friend,"In the beginning of the book I thought Desmond and Fancy would end up together, they didn't...that's why I like Mary B. Morrison's novels, they're different. I did want Fancy and Dez to be together though. The next book will be about Darius and Fancy, they are probably are soulmates since they kept running into each other in He's Just a Friend. I can't wait til her next book."
2,Needed more depth,"Well I won't say this book was a total waste of my time, but it's definitely not one I would recommend to someone else to read. I usually enjoy Mary B. Morrison's books, but this one just left a sour taste in my mouth. The characters weren't developed fully... we never got to understand WHY Fancy was the way she was. The little snippets of information about her past and her mother should've definitely been explored further considering Fancy was the main character and it would've helped us to better understand her make-up. It was too many things that should've been explained in more detail that just kinda left you hanging. Overall.. it was one of my least favorite books that I've read!"
3,Shocked,"I was shocked to find out when I read He's Just A Friend that it was not to my liking at all and I repeat my liking.Typical story of giving up the kitty kat for cash, clothes and cars. Wanting a man, but know he is no good for you and ignoring the one that really loves you. There was no twist to that lemon of a book at all. All of Mary B. Morrison's book are the bomb except this one. I don't know what was the point in that book. The only highlight was she reintroduced Darius Jones from Never Again Once More. Darius at the end of the book hooked up with Fancy, the main character of the book. Don't know what happened with them I guess we will have to read the next installment of this drama.There was some mediocre plots to the story, but nothing to right home about or tell a friend.Later!!!!"
1,"With Friend's Like This, You Don't Need Enemies","There is a week of my life I gave up reading this book that I will never get back. The book was preachy, it had no direction, it had no plot, the characters were shallow, the author was on some kind of soapbox, and it read worse than bad soap opera copy. This is too bad to even recommend for in-flight reading.Horrible book, horrible writing."
2,Boring - Couldn't follow at all,"I dislike this book. I couldn't even finish it. I guess the plot was ok. I just could not follow the book at all. he only thing I got out of the 4.5 chapters that I read was that the main character is a gold digger and she has ""a friend"" that wants to be more than friends but he doesn't make enough money for her. Andddddddd ... She was dating a married man without knowing he was married."
3,Okay,For the most part He's Just a Friend was a good read. I gave it a 3 because there were some boring parts.
2,NOT WORTH THE READ,"I WAS NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL WITH THIS BOOK. THE STORY COULD HAVE BEEN OKAY BUT THE WRITING STYLE WAS NOT VERY GOOD. SHE DESCRIBED THE SEX SCENES IN GREAT DETAIL...TOO MUCH SOMETIMES...HOWEVER OTHER IMPORTANT SCENES WERE JUST ""BLAH""...I DON'T KNOW IF THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF HER EROTICA WRITING OR WHAT BUT.....THE SEX FOR FOXY WAS OF COURSE IMPORTANT BUT IT WAS TOO MUCH AND THE OTHER CHARACTERS/THEIR SITUATIONS WERE LEFT FLAT....LIKE WHY EVEN MENTION TANYA??? IT WAS LIKE A MENTION BUT THEN NOTHING...IT WAS CRAZY....WOULD NOT RECOMMEND( READ FOR MY BOOKCLUB AND GENERAL CONCENSUS WAS 2 THUMBS DOWN)."
2,Not as good quality as they used to be,"I bought a pair of Chacos over 10 yrs ago, they were amazing! Well they finally started wearing out so I ordered the same exact model and size (10 wide) , not only were they not as wide (very important) but the straps were thinner and skinnier too. It really makes me mad when a company thinks they can charge a ton of money for a sub par product. Looks like I will be looking for a different brand sandal."
3,Not for all feet,"I ordered two pair, the z/1 and z/2. Loved the style and color of both, but I have to agree that Chaco's are not for everyone. I have a medium forefoot, high arch, and narrow heel. I'm also a large-boned woman with thick ankles (don't translate that to fat).By the time the foot straps were adjusted correctly, the buckle landed at the top of my foot sitting on the first metatarsal. So, not comfortable and definitely not attractive. There was plenty of black strap, but not enough of the color. It might have worked if the strap was free at the side supports and allowed the strap to slide completely around, but it's secured with triple stitching. No hope there. Also there is no allowance for heel strap adjustment. It is what it is, leaving you with a flip flop feel.Loved the foot bed, loved the color, but couldn't live with the buckle rubbing on the top of my foot. Back they go. :(Chaco Women's Z/1 Unaweep SandalWomen's Chaco Z2 YAMPA Big-Toe Comfort Sport Sandals"
2,So far? No good.,"After reading several reviews online I visited my local B&N, sat for a few minutes reading the opening pages, compared it to some others and ended up taking it home. I'm halfway through already but am finding that it's lacking in help. While it contains some valuable information and quick tips, I feel it's relying/blaming too much on my parent's rearing. I'm still waiting for the brilliant wisdom to shine through as so many had said it would. Will post again if it gets any better but for now I must say, so far? No good."
5,MUST READ for rediscovering yourself,"I discovered this book at a perfect time...in between a break up and another go round with him. Reading this book has allowed me to not only open my eyes to my own self-defeating habits, but has also allowed me to tap into my little explored self-conscious. I now feel like I have a better handle on why I am who I am, why I've done what I've done in relationships, why I never allowed myself to be alone...and more importantly, how to control these things.It wont permanently fix you because it will take a lot of time and work to follow the advice of this reading, but it will set the wheels in motion. The rest will have to be a conscious effort. As I type this review I also acknowledge how much work is still ahead of me, but I go forward with the knowledge that I have the power to make those changes."
3,Good but...,"A friend recommended this to me after an excruciating break up. ""She"" was my one and only, or so I thought. This book covers many areas of bad relationships. I myself had fallen deeply in love with a married woman, and I just knew we'd get it together. We didn't. This book helped me recognize that she wasn't leaving him. And so I was all over the place. This book held my irrational fears up for what they were, irrational. However, it begs you to examine your relationship with your parents. While my parents weren't perfect, I don't feel like they were as big a responsibility as the book suggests. Also, be careful, this book might make you confront fears and reality, and many aren't prepared for that path. But overall, if you're suffering, read this. You'll take away positives."
3,Good Read,"This book was helpful, yet not the best thing for my situation. I did not find the tactics so helpful, and I already knew my parents have created the foundational issue that I have in my relationships. It told me things I already knew, but this information may be helpful to others. Overall, it was a good self-help book, but it just was not for me I guess."
4,Great Insights -,"The insights represented in the book have been key to helping me take purposeful steps to begin to realize God's best for me.Addiction will almost always lead to destructive behaviour. The insight here helped me understand how, through my addiction I had placed a relationship before God - and with the end of the relationship a couple of years ago, I took a path that would surely have led to my destruction.It was an incredibly painful eye opener - I chose to sin after a break-up, yet my break-up was not with God - so why did I betray God? Howard Halpern's book will encourage you to find that source of insecurity and need for validation and help you on a road to realizing the gem that lies inside every one of us.I would recommend picking this book up, going through the table of contents and selecting three key topics that are most relevant to you right now and dig in. You will be blessed for taking the chance."
5,AUTHOR REVIEW,"I recently read ""How to Break Your Addiction to a Person"" by Halpern. He offers some unique insight into a problem that many people deal with. Chalked full of practial advice.---John D. MooreAuthor of Confusing Love with Obsession"
1,Yuck,I was looking for help with my relationship addiction. This book is so stuffed with mumbo jumbo I couldn't get through the first chapter.
3,There is no HOW to change it part,"I like the description of the ways relationships can be addictive and some practical advice on easing the breakup, yet I miss one very important part - how to actually ease up on the infantile neediness(how to do the internal work), so one won't be attracted to these kind of relationships in the first place.The author writes in the page 212:""The basis of my own approach is that the addiction is best stopped through a lot of thinking about it in the form of recognizing its infant nature and using this recognition to keep Attachment Hunger from dominating.""This doesn't sound like a good solution to me. Knowing the problem doesn't translate into fixing it.I recommend reading this book, but you will need others as well."
1,Meh...,"This one wasn't for me, but I am sure it was very helpful for others who have struggled through a loss."
5,"Reader from Reading, PA","Read this book a long time ago, if your going thru a bad time getting over someone, this book is for you. It helped me alot during a time when I needed it, in fact I loan out this book to people who I know who are going through the same thing, a book cannot completely help you, but this one should help see you though and realize alot about yourself and others in the process."
5,Great Tea!,"This tea is probably the best tea I have had. I am a fairly new tea drinker, but am afraid that this brand has probably spoiled me."
3,It looked interesting....,"Occasionally I'll buy something because it looks interesting, and this is one of those purchases. Maybe I'm just not ready for it, but it wasn't quite what I expected. Maybe it was a bit too orchestral, or not quite latin enough, I'm not sure. It's neither a love or hate. It's just there."
5,Song book with Piano Accompaniment,"Songs from Oklahoma, Carousel, South Pacific, The King And I, The Sound Of Music, State Fair, Allegro, Me And Juliet, Pipe Dream, Cinderella, Flower Drum Song, with commentary on each Musical."
5,Be prepared for compliments!,"This lotion smells absolutely delicious! Whenever I walk into a room I get tons of compliments on the scent of this lotion. Also, it lasts all day long. Not to forget that it is a great moisturizer keeping the skin super soft. Shockingly, I was expecting to get chased by bee's more often but that hasn't happened yet!"
1,Building Heidi,"The plans are often inaccurate, e,g,. measurements for the temporary backbone are way off. The plank marks on the stem make no sense. Over size lumber is called for wasting a lot of money.I emailed Wooden Boat as no one was listed for help but never received an answer. Definately not for the first time builder."
5,Fantastic,"I am very pleased with this purchase. Great price, the mouse works wonderfully and the Fingerprint Reader is awesome. Our family shares a computer and it is great to simply touch the reader to access your Vista login with out having to type a password.The login manager works with all websites I have tried and works better than expected.I would HIGHLY recommend this product. If you have Vista, you will have to download the updated driver, but it is easy to find and easy to install."
1,mouse not worth the time or money,this mouse is a flop- trying to get it to read your fingerprints is an exercise in futility- does not save time or secure anything
3,Microsoft hates FIREFOX......,"Because Firefox is their competitor browser wise, they are not compatible. Even opening them as an IE tab, the fingerprint scanner won't recognize it as a 'log in page'. The mouse is great, the scanner cool too, but I always use Firefox, so we'll see how often it can be used..."
3,The best ATV game available (but still mediocre),"Let me start with the good things about this game. It is relatively fast paced, the graphics are pretty good, the physics engine is nice, and the controls are, for the most part, intuitive.Now the bad. This game is supposed to be about tricks and the ability to kick your opponents off their ATV, but the tricks are nothing special, and the kick option is very limited. You hit the B button (which means you have to take a finger off the throttle), and the game decides which direction to kick. If there is an ATV on each side, it's a coin flip who gets kicked. And the supposed variety in tracks and riders is just a lot of the same-old same-old. (Who cares how many amateur or professional riders there are to choose from. Can YOU name a pro ATV rider?) Oh, and the music is insipid.But, if this is your thing, you might find it enjoyable. The game isn't BAD, it's just not that GOOD."
2,I'd rather listen to Cohen himself,"I feel the interpretations here lack the depth found in Leonard Cohen's interpretations. These songs sound like yet-another-song from these singers. If that's what you're looking for then okay, but it's definitely not something I would buy.And I find Leonard Cohen's voice quite interesting, as opposed to what the critics say on this page. I don't like all of his songs, though (esp. not the recent ones)."
2,Not so great tribute...,"I like many of the singers on this ""tribute"" CD (except Bono - I think He is a real fake), but Cohen sings his songs best (just like Gilbert Becaud, Neil Diamond etc.) and his voice is just fine! Don`t spend any money for this CD."
4,I love cohen,"I love leonard cohen, and he is the most influential writer in my life. I love his voice, and i think he is a great singer. The review ... wrote was one of the most childish, immature, and un-professional review i have ever seen on amazon. I am discusted, and at a loss of words that somebody would be that verbally abusive to a man so creative and under appreciated. You make me sick ... whatever your last name is."
2,Not The Field Commander....Himself.......,"Although,it is very ""nice"" that other artists appreciate Mr. Cohen, and try to ""pay tribute"" to his works, it is NOT The Field Commander......Sting does a very commendable job....however, the remainder is just that.....remainder....Cohen's voice may leave some ""cold"".....but no one can do someone else's poetry as the originator......Cohen does Cohen perfectly.......leave it alone....and for all you who have not had the ultimate privilege of experiencing The Field Commander first hand.....keep away....OR....try to get a video of LC performing live for ""Austin City Limits""......you may change your mind......he is absolutely brilliantly sexy....bad voice and all......"
4,A Great Introduction to a master poet and song writer,"Like many others, I love Leonard Cohen's brilliant writing, but find his voice less than beautiful. This albun has some great renditions of his wonderful work. Don Henley's biting tone is perfect for Everybody Knows and Tori Amos is poignant with Famous Blue Raincoat. Trisha Yearwood and Jann Arden give sweet melodies. Bono and Martin Gore's versions are interesting and very unlike any others I have heard. And I could listen to Billy Joel sing Light as the Breeze all day -- very sexy. Unfortunately, the album does have some low points. Peter Gabriel and Willie Nelson seem to drag their songs out forever, and Suzanne Vega seems quite uninspired by the Story of Isaac. All in all, though, this album is one of my favorites. And if you like this, be sure to get Jennifer Warnes' Famous Blue Raincoat. It's incredible."
3,"OK, but the source material is so much better....","I should start off by saying that, personally, I always prefer Cohen singing Cohen over cover versions. However, tempted by the idea of Bono doing ""Hallelujah"" and Sting doing ""Sisters of Mercy"" and ignoring the voice in back of head telling me that I should know better, I purchased this AlbumLet's face it: a cover version will nearly always entail a shift in meaning from that intended by the artist. At best this will be a mere shift in tone and sentiment (read: Willie Nelson (Bird on a Wire) and Peter Gabriel (Suzanne)) and, at worst, the song is ruined almost beyond repair (read: Elton John (I'm your Man and Don Henley (Everybody Knows)).The three stars go to Trisha Yearwood (Coming Back to You), Billy Joel (Light as a Breeze) and Peter Gabriel (Suzanne)."
4,Nice eclectic collection,I bought this in spite of Willie Nelson and because I really like Hallelujah. Turns out Willie's performance is one of my favorites while Bono performs a forgettable version of Cohen's primary claim to fame. Nothing wrong with Bono reinventing the song in his own image. But who would expect even Bono to do THAT song as something between a native American tribal chant and a techno dance track. If he didn't want to sing the song why not just give the chant treatment to something more obscure. But no one else dissappoints. Billy Joel and Don Henley are excellent. Elton John and Peter Gabriel aren't bad. Probably as good a collection of Cohen covers as there'll ever be.
4,famous blue raincoat,"I owe much to this CD because it introduced me to Tori Amos. Her rendition of Famous Blue Raincoat is simply overwhelming. Unlike other reviewers here I found Billy Joel unbearable, Elton John is always lukewarm. The real gems are Peter Gabriel and Bono in addition to Tori. But if you absolutely love the originals then you will not aggree. My comment is only for people who think Cohen is a very interesting but somewhat dull singer/songwriter."
2,This Tower Should Never have risen.,"I was so looking forward to this recording after all these years it's been available.But what a disappointment, from Bono's thumping contribution on which his vocals can barely be heard to two versions of ""Coming Back to You."" Whatsa matter, couldn't anyone find another Cohen gem to build this tower?I like Don Henley's ""Everybody Knows"" Aaron Neville's countrified ""Ain't No Cure for Love"" and Billy Joel sounding unlike himself on ""Light As a Breeze,"" but the rest of this recording does not to justice to a great songwriter and performer.Skip this unless you want to cringe as the tower rises!"
3,Don't buy if for just one song,"Very nice. HOWEVER, don't buy it because you wanted a particular song unless you are sure of the performance. I bought it for Hallelulah and am very disappointed. The volume on this song will not go up and the version is totally unlike what I expected."
5,Great songwriter!,Leonard Cohen is a great song-writer! Wish I knew about him when I was younger. No more needs to be said.
4,Dryver Series Subwoofers,"This sub kicks hard, moves about 8 or so inches. it is powerful enough that, when on full blast, will knock tea-cups off the shelf upstairs. the only difficult part is finding a box that is 8+- cubic feet. otherwise it pretty darn good, better than any JBL for the price!"
5,Pyle Dryver 15,"Good subwoofer for the price, I have two of these on a american bass vfl 200.1 and theyhit like no other, in my 93 deville they beat the hell out of my buddies 4 L7 12's in a blazer."
3,Not that bad...,"I didn't buy this sub for fantastic sound quality but did expect it to hit hard. Always beware if you can't find the RMS for a sub, anyway I had one hooked up to a Kenwood 9104D at 2 ohm in a 5 cubic foot ported box. It sounded pretty good but when i pushed anything near 800 watts at it the distortion was terrible. Finally the front plate that says pyle came off and the plastic cone just started breaking apart. For 75 bucks it would do as a home speaker in a huge box but not for anything close to 4000 watts, not even 1500 watts. Do not buy if you are expecting any low or heavy bass notes"
2,For the price I'm not upset,Bought these in June along with two Pyle 2000 watt amps. They hit hard as hell three months later I lost a voice coil. Today they started smoking and pooped out. For what I paid I'm not upset.
1,need negative 5 stars!!!!! junk junk junk,Should have believed the old saying you get what you pay for!!! Low price for low quality junk! Didn't last a week on kicker 1000 watt amp turned way down. Following the break in process. Called about warranty they want you to pay to ship there and back and a 25.00 fee. So more then what you paid to start with!!!! What a joke!!! Save your money buy better speakers these are not for you. The people that gave anything over 1 star are crazy!!!
2,They're okay..,"This sub was installed, used, they worked pretty good, then... both of them had cracks on the plastic, don't know why, so i decided to buy a new set(they are cheap enough), got a new vented box, then, wham! cracked again....would not recommend"
4,pyle dryver 15s,"Most people say the brand name pyle make their equipment cheaply. I don't care what anyone says about these subs, they are rediculously loud. They literally take my breath away. But I would not recommend putting them in a ported box"
1,Sucks,"Blew in one day. sucks ass. dont buy one. It will blow on you under any wattage. you get what you pay for. no offence to the seller, just the brand"
1,junk,one speaker blew out and I wasn't even driving it hard... Allot of buzz buzz and not solid kick.. Even tried in vented and non vented... junk....ran two together at 4000 each yea right 4000 each.. what 4000 watts were they using ppmo or real watts? doesn't say....
2,not so good,its an okay sub but for being such a high wattage its not that loud i built a box to spec and i had one 12 inch kicker that was like 10 years old and it still hit harder than this one not that impressed with it i know its cheap but kicker is like 20 bucks more i would def go with that one instead plus you dont need a massive amp to power it
1,Edible is a questionable term,"I was so excited about these sprinkles for my cupcake decorating needs... that is until i tried a cupcake that i had LIGHTLY dusted with the glitter.It feels like tiny razors in your mouth and absolutely ruins the texture of your baked goods. Go natural, dump these ""edible"" flakes."
4,like,Haven't used this yet but like the shimmer to it and can't wait to use. It looks nice and glittery
4,Fresh and good quality,"Nice and fresh, exactly what we needed. This product seemed to be fresher than what I had previously purchased at the local grocer."
2,it's not waterproof,"So on one hand this watch is actually super cute, it isn't fancy but it is classy and stylish looking at the same time. BUT, the real bummer is that I thought the thing was waterproof. It immediately filled up with condensation and broke. I might order another because I love the look of it, but I really need a waterproof watch so I might have to try something different."
3,late night moods,"disc no. 1 excelent, speciality ( soleil) roxane) ain't sunshinenature boy) disc # 2 so.so."
3,Anti Virus subscription is only 6 months,"Product seems to work good except: 1) tells me I am not registered, yet I am and all functionality works. 2) No email support. 3) Initial antivius subscription is only for 6 months. Clicking on the renew button takes you to a ""The page cannot be displayed"" page. On the website, renewing is $34.95/year."
4,Zone Alarm is alot easier to use than McAfee,"I set up my sister's new computer and it had a 60-day free trial of McAfee Security Suite. She uses a dial-up connection so before I took it to her house I connected it to my DSL connection to get the latest updates. McAfee keeps wanting to validate the subscription and even after updating on my DSL, when I set up the computer at her house, McAfee had a download that took over two hours. She recently called me in tears because McAfee had shutdown her virus scan software because it could not validate the subscription. So, I've countered with buying Zone Alarm AntiVirus 2006 and I don't expect to hear from her over fear that her new computer is not protected. Zone Alarm makes it easy."
5,A great working product,"It does exactly what you want it to do. It protects your system and lets you feel secure about it. It's easy to use and intuitive. Once it has your directions which it prompts, it's set it and forget it."
4,ZoneAlarm AntiVirus 2006,Good overall package if you need virus and firewall. Works in the background with little impact to other processes once it has learned and set rules for your applications. Nice price too.
4,antiVirus with hidden attributes,"It does do what is promised..but, I come from many years of using Norton. Getting use to the constant pop-up questions took some time; as Norton never ask me anything! Zone does have a smaller footprint than Norton, thus saving many MB of space. A lot easer to use and to dump if you MUST!...Norton took me weeks to figure out HOW to get it OFF my computer! Would I buy it again, YES..I am still looking for a firewall, if zones sales team has one, I have never been approched to buy it..if it is already ""in there"" I do not know! I DO KNOW, My computer has NO BUGS! and THAT's what counts at the end of the daycomisar in Ohio"
3,It's OK - You get what you paid for,"I chose this antivirus based on other reviews and comments, hoping I would have the same experience. I agree that it is user friendly, but I find it very annoying. Everytime I try to run software that is already installed on my computer, it takes Zone Alarm forever to ask me if its ok for that program to access the internet. It takes so long that I end up thinking that my computer froze. I've had to uninstall it twice because my computer kept crashing on me. I'm finally where I need to be but my computer runs slower than when I had Norton installed. I switched from Norton thinking all I need was just a simple antivirus, nothing complicated and I have yet to see software out there that will do that. I am hoping that Microsoft's antivirus program will be successful so I can switch. After the rebate, it comes out to $10 bucks - not bad to have an antivirus software for $10. You do get what you paid for."
1,zone alarm fails again,"today ZoneAlarm renew failed for 18 tries , ZA refuses to have phone support the ultimate in tech service abdication. Za also failed to run once downloaded and can not find a manger or tech person to bother to address. the issue . They actually would like to charge us to answer tech questions even though they know they are having server failures.This once responsive comapany has joined the Big Oil Enron ranks in refusing to address customer needs."
2,not for the novice,"I run XPPro and after 10 days of back and forth with the customer service people (very helpful by the way) I still do not have the product installed. This is NOT, at least for me, a case of put the cd in the drive and all is well! I have used the downloadable freeware versions and they preform well. No doubt this will also IF I ever get it installed. Right now it is a case of having to dig deeply into hidden files to do so! Hopefully other users have better luck."
3,I love the firewall don't love the AV snd spyware tools,"The firewall is great.the AV and Spyware plugins are just that, if ZoneAlarm didn't load nether did the AV. Very uncool. Also AV is a CA product Boo Boo. Don't trust CA as far as you can throw your car.I do think it has growth, would love to see them get another AV company as their backed and to make the AV a stand-alone process, that loads with out ZA needing to be loaded."
3,If you're headed to keet seel this is not the book for you,I agree with the editorial (Kirkus) reviewer; which you ought to read and pay attention to before buying. This is strictly one man's impressions of what the Colorado Plateau means to him. It is not authoritative as to the ruin's archeology or anthropology. It could better be classed as poetry.
4,Jill Scott and Hil are alone at the top,"Only Jill Scott and Hil are at the top of today's true R&B voices. If you want someone who can blow, pick it up now. The production is solid and Hil performance shines."
4,Laidback street soul from Hil St Soul,"Laidback street soul from Hil St Soul, led by UK vocalist Hilary Mwelwa -- sounding really great here on this Japanese album that nicely mixes up her groove! There's a strong sound of urban London running through the tracks -- a melange of city sounds that differ nicely from the stereotypes showing up on US soul albums of this nature -- really setting the scene for Hil to open up her groove, and state her unique perspective on things. Titles include ""Copasetik & Cool"", which features guest work by Roots Manuva -- plus ""All That (strings mix)"", ""What's Goin Down"", ""Blue Tears"", ""Alright"", ""Shine"", and ""Reach As One"". (Reviewed at www.dustygroove.com)"
4,Disco as an artform.,"Chic managed to turn repetition into an artform. Aside from the outstanding rhythm guitar foundation of Nile Rodgers, the rest of their sound was built from fairly simple elements. The vocalists had limited range and the string section arrangements very ordinary indeed. However, the sum of the parts is a very attractive package. The track When You Hear this Song for example has only a sad two line refrain which is repeated over and over again by a girlie chorus to a sort of hynotic bass/guitar pattern. Sounds dull but somehow it works and leaves its mark on you. Although this album does not have the variety of C'est Chic, it is probably their most consistent work and includes the timeless Disco Anthem Good Times. As with all Chic Material the rythmn work is second to none. Its got a tap dancing solo as well."
4,"C'mon, can this group make anything NOT good?!","Mr.Rogers at his best. Chic IS the 70's, and like everything else they've done, this is smooth as glass. Shame on you if you haven't added this to your collection."
4,at the end of 79',"I was in the 10th grade and I remember going to the neighborhood Record shop and buying this album earned from some cash I made mowing a lawn. As I recall on the Dick Clark Rockin' New Years eve show Chic performed ""Good Times"" for the 1980 new years celebration,it was a blast.I also brought that Queen album with ""another one bites the dust"" and Queen made the bass line slightly different enough to avoid any lawsuits. (the Sugarhill Gang had previously settled for pirating the Bass line on ""Good Times"".) I later lost the album when I lent it too a friend of mines and learned it was later damaged, I accepted some cash and never repurchased the album until now on disc, it's a great album. Now Nile Rogers is the only man standing from this ensemble R.I.P....Tony&Bernard."
5,Chic is Bad!,"Chic has Never gotten the Love it Deserves.Nile Rodgers&Bernard Edwards are The Cornerstones.this is a Tight Album.THe Grooves Never Let up.Good Times alone is a Timeless Classic.it Has Inspired Countless Other Artists for Instance Queen,Sugar Hill Gang etc... In The Pocket Grooves Never Miss Here."
5,It Works!,I didn't believe in numerology before. I couldn't see how numbers could affect our lives. This book has made me a believer. I calculated my numbers based on my birthday and used the book to interpret the results and they were about 90-95% accurate. I also calculated my numbers for this year 2006 and they were again right on the dot. It's as if it was reading my mind as to what I intend to do this year. This has got me started on numerology. I am planning to go deeper into studying numerology.
3,Low production quality,"An interesting film. The debate meanders quite a bit and the close-ups of dictionary definitions of simple words seem very art-student / high-school-video-project. I am in total sympathy with the director's politics, however I think 5 dollars would be a fair price to pay for a DVD with as low production standards as this. It really smacks of the amatuer.However, there are really very interesting interviews done - and if you do get it make sure to watch the special features. The story of how one politician tried to make some modest policy changes at the FCC is very revealing.In short, some quite interesting points, not very well presented. I am not at all sorry I bought it and have found it interesting enough to watch a number of times."
5,Want the truth?,"If you are looking for what is really happening in this country or how the world is being manipulated by corporations, this is the beginning of the truth. This is where the true investigative reporting has been relegated. You will have to search for what is really going on about what you are being conditioned to know. No where on the mainstream media will you find this kind of information and it is a relief that there are people out there that are not subverting the truth and believe it is your right to know what people and corporations are doing to keep you in the dark.This should be required viewing and should be in the curriculum of just not colleges but in high schools. Open your eyes and be aware because keeping your head in TV, listening to radio and talking useless talk into cell phones will be catering to the entities that don't want you to know or be aware about the truth."
2,level vials failed,"I have owned the LM30 about three years. I have had the same problems others here mention: spinning occasionally requires assistance and the level vials leaked. I contacted CST/Berger via email asking for repair cost and got a quick response without cost info. I replied asking again for cost of repair and received assurance on September 21, 2009: `The maximum cost your repair will reach is $125.00 plus shipping at which point they will replace your unit at that cost.' So I sent it in. I got a call for credit card info to start the repair, then another call saying the unit will have to be replaced - cost $150 plus shipping. I called to object and was told the price went up in February. I am still negotiating. The support people seem helpful, but I will not use this business again."
4,Conrad's Second Latin Attempt,"This latest CD by Conrad Herwig is very good, but something seems to be missing from it. Maybe it had been hyped up too much in my mind, but when I played the music, I felt like it was missing an element. An important element, sadly. Just like the Latin Side of John Coltrane album, I didn't hear as much inspired playing as I am accustomed to hearing on Herwig's albums. He certainly has set a high standard level for himself! I have seen Conrad Herwig live and was BLOWN AWAY. If you have the chance, I would suggest hearing him play at any price.Back to this CD though... I think I was missing his compositional capabilities, although his arrangements are always strong. Regardless, this is a strong CD, and if it was the first CD I had heard by Herwig, I know that I would have been hooked on him forever. Unfortunately, I have heard many CDs by Herwig that had more inspired solos than this one."
4,Not quite as good as his latin Coltrane,Granted it's a live set (a plus) and perhaps not the beneficiary of as much rehearsal time but some of the arrangements (So What and Blue in Green) are a bit ragged. Five stars for what Conrad is trying to do. A bit lacking in the execution. Would be interesting to see what trumpeter/conguero jerry Gonzalez would do (better yet if he occupied the trumpet spot in this session)>
1,Unkinda Blue,"Perhaps if one has never heard Mile's original, this attempt might slip by. For those who know Kind of Blue, this CD is like someone trying to do a ""latin"" version of the Eiffel Tower. Rather than trying to push the originals through some kind of latin strainer, it would have been interesting to hear a fresh interpretation of the music."
1,Rip off!!,"The book, which is in spanish, gives pretty good instructions on how to do the will in spanish. But the actual will forms to be completed and used as the person's actual will, are in english!!-----making the book totally without value to spanish only speakers. Want to sign a will written in a language you can not read?...then this is the book for you!"
5,Very original,"I have a vinyl LP of Los Saylors that I really enjoyed alot. This CD is fantastic, because it has all the great songs from my old vinyl and then some. Although ""Sonreir and Paloma deja me ir"" are not among the most popular songs, they are my favorites. It's great to hear 'em and all the rest of the songs with no poping and scatching sounds. Recording sounds like the originals. Although many other artist recorded some of these songs, I truly prefer Los Saylors' version. They have or had their very own style. One of the better buys."
4,Nice Feel...Durability is an Issue,"I found these balls at Target ($8.49 for 18 balls). For less than 50 cents per ball I wasn't expecting much, but I was wrong.These balls give decent distance off the tee and don't feel like you are hitting rocks on impact with your irons. Like most ""distance"" balls, creating spin around the green with these isn't always easy, but it is no worse than most similar balls I've played.My biggest complaint is durability. After just 9 holes, the laminations started peeling off the cover and small scuffs quickly turned into large ones.These are good ""value"" balls and are ideal for golfers who lose 3 or more balls per round and/or have a 20+ handicap. If they were more durable, I'd give them 5 stars."
2,Tiresome faux-Irish,"I bought the album because of the excellent rendition of ""The Patriot Game,"" but, unfortunately, the rest of the songs are nowhere near as good. I know the US-based Irish descendants love to hark back to the times in the ""old country""; in this case, the sentiments just seem forced."
3,"""Manana,he was convinced,properly translated to ""possibly someday or perhaps not at all."" Manana,indeed.","In this episode ,we find Longarm being sent to the Mexican border town of Del North across the border from El Paso to extradite a prisoner from Mexico. Longarm ,soon finds out ,as if he didn't already know,nothing gets done simply, when dealing with Mexican authorities.What should be a simple procedure,turnd into a convoluted cat-and- mousegame,that seems never ending.As usual, Longarm finds lots of other things to occupy himself with;some interesting and others just plain drudgery.This story never really lives up to the kind of tale we look forward to in this series.Its characters are okay,but not really stellar. The colorful and descriptive writing just isn't there either. There is a fair storyline to the novel,but nothing exceptional.The best that this adventure has for Longarm,is an opportunity to get out of the depths of a cold Denver winter;and enjoy some warmer weather."
3,Not one of her best,"While I love JL, I have to admit this was not one of her books I could really get into. I have read everysingle one of her books everytime I started one of those I was hooked but, there was something about this one."
1,Yuck!,This is one of my least favorite books by Lindsey. The spanking scene was just a bit much. Sorry.
5,awesome,this is one of my favorite romances of all time! Rannulf id my dream hero and the time period is rich with life!
3,Great rendering of the medieval period,"I really liked the heroine in this story. Reina was amazing, determined, confident, caring, intelligent. The hero... Well, I wouldn't mind it if it wasn't mentioned all the time that he was a giant. And he had some TSTL moments - like 'Wives are not supposed to enjoy it'. Sometimes I just wanted to hit him with something, and he really seemed slow at times. Not to mention rude, obnoxious, inconsiderate. it didn't help that the heroine kept calling him names. But what I liked was that he wasn't the perfect lover from the beginning, and that he was always trying to improve himself. The book had its moments, and I really got the feeling that they lived in the middle ages. So if you are looking for a little escape into the middle ages, this is the book for you."
5,:),"I am slowly trying to convert my paperback collection into a Kindle library. This was one of the first Lindsay novels I read many many years ago now, and while my paperback is still in fine condition it is definitely starting to show it's age and use. It was a definite pleasure purchasing this old favorite in Kindle format so I can continue to revisit it for many years to come."
4,Medieval Adventure,"Ranulf is a soldier for hire. He is hired to kidnap Reina and return her to her betrothed husband. All too soon he discovers that he has been tricked. Reina's real betrothed husband died and her father also has died before arranging another marriage for her. Realizing that she and her people and lands are vulnerable, she offers to marry Ranulf. He has money, but no lands. She has lands, but little money. At first, Ranulf is hesitant. He doesn't have much use for a Lady, but realizes that it is an opportunity he can't turn down. Besides, he likes a woman that will stand up to him. As you can expect, these two fall in love despite their initial annoyance with each other. A charming and amusing story."
2,I Just Couldn't Get into It,"I am a huge JL fan, and I have to say that this one is not nearly as good as her other books. I found the girl, Reina, to be annoying and the guy, Ranulf, to be a stupid brute.The sudden change in feelings toward each other was also very bizarre. They would be yelling at each other, he would threaten to beat her backside, and then they'd have sex that Reina didn't enjoy. Then, to add a conflict I guess, Ranulf visits the village whore for advice.I just felt that this book didn't have any of Lindsey's usual delightful humor that grabs my attention. And, I found the battle scenes more enjoyable than the love scenes, which isn't exactly romance."
5,"FUNNY, REFRESHING AND VERY SPIRITED.","This book was great. This is one of my favorite books by Lindsey. The heroine had spirit. It's not often that I read about the hero needing to learn the ways of a female body. It was very interesting. His handsome and has women constantly falling for him, not knowing that women were also to find their pleasure. It's neat how he goes about learning, though."
5,Wonderful,"I was not disappointed with this book. I was DEFINITELY one of my favorites. At first Ranulf seem so dangerous and cold, but with Reina help he turns out to be a man any woman can love. I found it very heart warming that he took the time and effort to find a way to give his wife pleasure with his fears getting in the way.Both Reina and Ranulf were WONDERFUL characters. Reina was soOO sprited and so fun. Ranulf was so caring, understanding,& fair. I love the relationship they have going on. If it wasn't for Reina wit and spunk we wouldn't have seen Ranulf playful, sexual side. I LOVED THIS BOOK AND RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO READ IT. Johnanna Lindsey biggest fan."
4,Engaging,"I am not an avid reader of romance books but I have read all by Johanna Lindsey. What I found appealing about this particular book was the relationship between Reina and Ranulf. It demonstrated how important laughter is in love and how once it has been found, how it should be savored. A lovely book."
4,Kallmaker leaves me wanting more.,"I read Touchwood before I read Watermark and I have to admit to having mixed feelings about the first book. While I thought Louisa was a great woman, I never really bought her relationship with Rayann. That said, I absolutely adored Teresa in Watermark. She was intelligent, witty, and well-written. She is, by far, one of my favorite Kallmaker characters. I was definitely hoping she and Rayann would be successful in their romance. Kallmaker handled Rayann's ""hurt and pain"" throughout the book realistically. While the romantic in me wanted more from Teresa and Rayann by the book's end, I still recommend the book. Kallmaker succeeds once again in presenting us with two beautiful leads and a bookful of wonderful and memorable characters."
5,No matter what I read I come back to this one,"I have written over 500 reviews, with my name and without. I've read thousands of lesbian novels by now, some wonderful, many OK and some terrible. Whenever I'm asked about outstanding books though, I always come back to this one and it's companion Touchwood. The first one is a May/December romance, told with humor and great understanding. The second is about wrenching loss and second love. Together they tell a wonderful tale of the power of relationships. Both should be read."
2,"Heartbreaking, Disappointing","After being enthralled by Touchwood, I was hoping that there would be a sequel in which the Louisa's and Rayann's life together would be further explored. What did they laugh about, cry about, fight about? How did they dance the dance of their existence together? So many avenues to explore.Without knowing what happens in Watermark, I bought it and was deeply disappointed. I was asked to believe in the depth of Louisa's and Rayann's love for one another through the mechanism of grief preventing Rayann from exploring love with a more suitable, ""younger"" partner. I didn't ""buy"" it. I don't think there will be any more Rayann sans Louisa sequels for me."
1,Say no to Bamboo!,"The first one of these I got promptly broke because of the design - the center section, when fully extended, is poorly supported. When made of bamboo it just breaks. I have a similar one made of hardwood and it will last forever. However, not realizing this at the time I asked for a replacement and Amazon did this promptly. After one month one of the floor panels warped so much it broke a glue joint. It was just easier to repair it than return it, so learn from my misfortune and only buy hardwood when buying a utensil holder."
1,Poorly made,This item is very flimsy. It arrived with improper packing and the tray was cracked & broken. The small nails that hold the panels together were bent making it difficult to repair. Still debating on whether or not to send it back or try to repair it.
4,Great Shipping!,"Got this to organize drawers ! Make sure you measure width, you may not need expandable product! Overall product looks great!"
1,Horrible Quality,"I ordered this item along with one from the company Axis. This drawer arrived broken in multiple pieces. Even if they packed it better, I still would regret the purchase. This is the cheapest quality and would have broke easily eventually. I'm going to try to find a similar product through Axis, which my organizer from them was great quality and was in perfect condition coming from the same shipment."
1,Piece of junk!,"Very cheap and flimsy. The head band is a thin wire, very large and does not adjust to my adult head. The mute button has to be held down to use. The mouthpiece is very cheap as well. Not happy with this purchase at all!"
5,THE Christmas Brass album to own!,"If you intend to only have one Christmas Brass album, make sure this is it! Virtuouso playing, clever arrangements (The Twelve Days of Christmas especially)and wonderful acoustics.Two thumbs up!!"
3,Book incomplete in the U-Boats images!,"This book ia not very good. The U-Boat ilustrations are bad and change or error in the Types... Best regards,"
3,Good Info,"Would have been happier if the book was twice as long, and had more details on the men who crewed the boats.."
1,Automobiles - Buick History channel,"I cannot recommend this video to any but the most diehard Buick fans. I expected to see a history of Buick. Instead I got a leftist commentary on unions, poor quality Buicks, etc. The writers were clearly anti-business. I could excuse the misidentification of various Buicks, year and model, but I didn't need social or historical commentary to put things into context. I will make sure I do not order other automotive titles from the History Channel. I wasted my money."
5,A good Introduction,"A great introduction to Ken Wilber. An overview of his main ideas as well as some material from his new book ""One Taste"". Easily Recommended"
3,The height of pretentiousness,Wilber makes me tired. His conceit drips from every word. Jesus! Reading his journel feels more like an ad for his ego (which clearly has no boundry). I've written a journal for years and I haven't the foresight to keep a book of famous quotes at my side for the spontaneous urge to plagarize or name drop. I think he ghostwrites for Donald Trump.
5,Aah...Nostalgia,"It's about time someone re-released the entire Babys collection. Way to go One Way Records! It's difficult to choose the best release by this highly ""under appreciated"" band but this cd merits much consideration. From the rocking, upbeat title track to the sentimental classic ""Every time I think of you"", this cd has it all. Although the greatest hits collections are an excellent means for those venturing into the Babys ""realm"", it has long been my opinion that the real gems are interspersed amongst their five cd's. This especially holds true here. ""You (got it)"" and ""Love don't prove I'm right"" are just two examples but overall the whole cd is fantastic! If you like ""Anthology"" but don't have any of thier other cd's, start collecting!"
2,"Do the words ""undeveloped plot"" mean anything to you?","Well, I knew this movie was going to bad after all the reviews I read, but something still compelled me to watch it. What a stupid choice on my part. I expected to be at least a little entertained, but by the end of the movie I was confused. The movie was a jumble of nonsense and an undeveloped plot. While sitting through the credits, I pondered about the actual purpose of the movie. By the time it was over, I was still asking myself if it ever really began. And that kid, Patrick, was so terrified and traumatized through out the movie, and then at the end he was suddenly okay with everything. It didn't make any sense! Well, my point is that it wasn't a very good movie. It was a waste of time. If you are willing to waste 90 minutes of your life, by all means, do so, but I wouldn't recommend it!"
1,Scaly and smelly,"How anyone could have actually enjoyed this film is beyond me, and I'm one of the easily amused lamers who thought Lake Placid was a good movie. Aside from the special effects, there is nothing here. Fake, stereotypical characters made even more intolerable by some of the most horrendous acting I've seen outside of Seventh Heaven stumble through a plot that would insult the intelligence of a retarded howler monkey. It's a shame, too, because real life Komodo Dragons trully are some of the scariest predators around. The fact that there's not a single effectively tense scene in the entire film, then, is even more proof that whatever team collaborated to shove out this piece of garbage should never do so again."
3,"Cool effects, bad plot","I was really excited when I saw the box for Komodo at the Video library, but it was gone. I went home dissapointed, but learned that my friend had just rented it that same day. Ironic, huh? Anyway, I went over to watch it with full hopes and left both satisfied and dissapointed. Good Points)cool jurrasic park CGI effectsmoderate excitementAccurate Komodo dragonsBad Points)Almost no plotBad actingwhen they switch from cool CGI to horrible finger puppet effectsdoesn't go into depth with the dragonsBasically, when somebody made a Komodo dragon movie, I was hoping it would be better than this one. Oh well, I guess I'll have to wait a while longer. Too bad.p.s.Watch the making of the film at the end of the movie. It's interesting and it shows a real water monitor and several real komodos.signed, world renowned volderfreak reviews incorporated"
3,Cheesy Good Time With Some Nifty Lizards,"""Komodo"" is an enjoyably silly, occasionally creepy thriller. The premise of a bunch of Komodo dragons (the world's largest lizards, and very nasty beasties in real life) living on an island off South Carolina is preposterous, and the script and acting never rise above the standard for this kind of thing, but the lizards are impressive and worth checking out for fans of movie monsters. It's basically an old-fashioned ""giant animal"" b-movie (a la ""Them"" or ""Black Scorpion"") with slightly more believable monsters, some nice effects work and a splash of gore here and there. Not a great movie by any means, but then it doesn't try to be. Have a few beers, chuckle along with the stiff dialogue, enjoy a scare or two, and cheer on the dragons! (For anyone interested in a fascinating take on the real Komodo dragons that manages to be both scary and quite funny, I heartily recommend the book ""Last Chance to See"" by Douglas Adams.)"
4,"Great Movie, If you just want to sit back and enjoy a movie","From all the reviews here, I thought Komodo would be crap, but I also felt that alot of people here don't know what they are talking about. Most of the people who gave this movie a bad grade didn't even enjoy the movie because they automaticly assumed it would be crap before they popped into the VCR. This is actually a great movie if you just want to take your mind off things and watch a movie with great effects, although we could have done without the ""Nature Boy"" scenario."
2,Tolerable,"I rented this one with low expectations and I got exactly what I wanted: a goofy, essentially plotless action/thriller that was easy to make fun of. There are a lot of things that are just plain bad about this film: the acting, the direction, the characterization, the unoriginal storyline etcetera, etcetera. However, the few good things (some cool special effects; the overall corniness) actually make the film watchable. It's kinda fun to laugh at the stupid choices that the characters make, then laugh even harder when they get gnawed on by the impressive lizards. All in all, if you're in the mood for a light comedy, errr, I mean, thriller, then this movie is okay.."
2,Plot?,Why were komodo dragon eggs dumped on this island in the first place? How come nobody noticed these big lizards breeding on the island in the intervening years? Who knows? These questions are never answered in the course of the film. I didn't like or care about any of the characters in this slow moving and not very scary movie. Its one saving grace? The komodo dragons are the first movie monster that actually looked and acted realistic.
3,A LITTLE DRAGON IN PLACES,"Low budget films rarely achieve this kind of excellence in the special fx department. Director Michael Lantieri, an Oscar winner for visual effects for JURASSIC PARK, obviously brought his class to this Australian thriller.There are some richly intense scenes, and Lantieri does well in creating atmopsheric tension. Unfortunately, there's no explanation as to why the Komodos have grown so huge; and why didn't the oil company get rid of them sooner?The holes in the plot hurt this film some; the acting by Kevin Zegers and Billy Burke is commendable; however, Jill Hennessey doesn't seem to have the range to carry the lead.Not a bad film, just an average one."
2,"An ""okay"" movie","Hubby and I rented this movie a few weeks ago. It was your run-of-the mill ""monster"" movie. The graphics were good; however, I think it ""demonized"" Komodo dragons. (Anybody who has watched the Crocodile Hunter episode of Steve Irwin being on Komodo island with those lizards will know exactly what I mean.) They can become ferocious, yes, but not near as so as depicted in the movie. The movie is scary enough, but not a collector's item."
5,Heartwarming Christmas Story,"MY CHRISTMAS SOLDIER is a heartwarming story of the true meaning of Christmas as seen through the eyes of a child. Despite language barriers, the threat of ""evil enemies"" and the paranoia surrounding war-time America, a young boy is able to reach out and find common ground and humanity in a group of strangers desperately in need of solace on Christmas Eve. Superb performances and riveting story-telling. A wonderful Christmas gift for adults and children alike."
2,Too corny,"I purchased this to possibly show at an evening service at our church around Christmas. One review I read said it sounds sappy, but it's really not that bad. Don't believe it. Too sappy to show. There is an interview (included with the extras) with a former German POW from WWII that might be worth the price. It's much more interesting than the title video."
2,Wrong Item,Different item came and when I called back they did not have KVM switches at all. I was given a full refund.
3,"Not Her Best, Still Better Than The Rest","Well, perhaps my rating is unfair. If it were anyone other than the fantastic Patricia Veryan the rating would probably be five stars. Unfortunately, she has in the past shown her readers that she is capable of attaining far greater heights than this book. However, the story of Val and Susan is quite entertaining. The subplots are more engrossing than the actual romance. Valentine is a suitable hero but Susan is the screechy, quick-to-jump-to-the-worst-conclusion-possible type of heroine I deplore. Having made that clear, let me just say that anything Patricia Veryan writes is worth looking into, and this book is no exception. Regardless of your personal feelings towards the main characters, this story is carefully crafted and comes to a surprising finish. One more bonus, especially for the Dev-otees in Veryan land: Alain Devinish makes a cameo appearance, as does the mysterious Diccon."
5,yes,sissy spacek is a good a actress this is one of my favorite movies it is really good plus its a move I can relate to
5,A real page-turner,"A fun and gripping story about global politics and the ""war between the sexes,"" 'A World Between' does an excellent job of showing how fanaticism can warp perception and thus alter reality. When the peaceful world of Pacifica is subjected to 'missions' from the rabid Femocrats of Earth and the male-dominated Transcendental Scientists, both intent upon converting Pacifica to their own viewpoints, it's a real challenge to the citizens and the government. Public opinion is moulded through the media, and Pacifica prides itself on being the most media-savvy and sophisticated world in the human Galaxy. Only now the Pacificans' own 'First Amendment' type laws are being used against them..Frequently graphic, occasionally disturbing, and always enjoyable.Warning: This book contains some explicit passages that are definitely adult in nature. Despite my immense liking for it, I have to rate this title 'R' because of the language and sexual explicitness."
4,Very Healthy Product!,This product is very healthy for you. It did NOT leave a nasty taste as some of these Flax Oils do. Happy with it and it came very well wrapped.
2,this is not an ultimate collection,"If you anticipate an ""ultimate collection"" will span an artist's career, contain hits and lesser known gems, come with information other than song titles, restores low fidelity recordings, and offers something to every fan, then this collection is poorly named to say the least. What you get is 138 minutes of studio sessions from 40 years ago that sound like they were rescued from the bottom of a pond and thrown on cd with no care for continuity or quality. Serious fans might be glad to have these dead-sounding tracks in one place for cheap but the poor reproduction quality, lack of anthological inspiration, and no companion literature would better be described as the ""whatever collection."""
4,Egalitarian behaviour,"A finnish geneticist wrote a book about the relationship between humans and dog: the wonderfull relationship, as far I know has its basic rules in the forest were we learned how to handle another individuals and also other animals near by us. Understanding the basics is very important; this book is most valuble."
4,Great deal on comfy shoes,Bought a pair of these for my 11 yr. old son who is very attentive to name brand at the moment. He loved them and said they are the most comfortable skate sneaker he has ever worn. We will be shopping for another pair soon...same brand! The price is great too!
4,Etnies Men's Calicut Skate Shoes,Nice shoe! Looks really sharp in black suede with brown/tan Etnie accent. My 12 year old absolutely loves this shoe and wears it every day. I recommend getting these on sale as they wear out relatively quickly with boys hard daily use. Fits true to size and my son prefers these over Vans for both comfort and durability.
3,"Great info, very bad editing","The information in this book provides a reasonable overview of the people and music highlighted, and the photos are terrific. HOWEVER...I was very disappointed to discover that this beautiful book is filled with LOTS of typos, incorrect and missing photo descriptions, and stupid mistakes such as a completely incorrect inset of songs attributed to George Gershwin, and no listing of the ones he did write. These errors are inexcusable and the fact that they weren't corrected before publication cheapens the work and makes it very clear that the publisher had no interest in creating a quality product."
4,Good Pics-Interesting Stories,"Book is loaded with excellent pictures and gives good insight to composers and singers who helped to make up the ""great american songbook"""
4,Excellent tape,"The first short is very good, and the others are good as well. I have seen the Hoi Polloi short more than 10 times, and am still not bored of it. It is full of laughs and one of the Stooges all time bests.John"
4,Cute refreshing and entertaining,"I enjoy the workings of Sandra Oh so I made the choice. The little girl co-star will soon be Sandra's competition. Both worked so well together. The plot was cute, it unfolded a little predictably, albeit in a cute and humorous way.The movie was good entertainment. A glass of wine and my easychair made it extra special."
2,"I like Sandra Oh, but...","Did anyone else think this movie didn't make any sense? Why would an Asian woman with excellent English skills be working in a Chinatown restaurant kitchen? I get that not all Asians have to have college degrees and work as doctors or lawyers, but it doesn't make any sense that Sandra Oh's character would be doing a service job in Chinatown. It also didn't make any sense that the butcher wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. What Chinese immigrant goes to Canada or America so that his son or daughter becomes a butcher?Could somebody please make a movie that reflects the real, contemporary Asian America/Canada? I'm so tired of watching movies that talk about ""saving face."" Yes, that's part of Chinese culture...but that theme has been done to death, and in more compelling films."
5,Life Changing,"The Hathor Material is a wonderful opening to the Interdimentional Beings the Hathors. Tom Kenyon is a incredible channel for the Hathors. The book offers many tools for Ascension that can be used to surf the ever changing times that we find ourselves in. I found the material to be enlightening and life changing. It offers practical material to follow that will support personal and soul growth.Tom Kenyon offers new information and insights from the Hathors at his website [...]Susan Mavity Author ""The Light Within, Gift Of A Rose"""
5,Wowee....,"I love this book, it is filled with really terrific information and is a book you can refer to as you walk your path towards enlightenment. Tom Kenyon and Virginia Essene are awesome."
4,My favorite,"I'm not sure I believe in ascended masters anymore but the messages in this book were outstanding! It's mostly about appreciation at all times, great read."
4,A great little book to get you motivated,"I found this book to be very nice. The author does a good job of getting your ""mojo"" working.She explores an array of sexual experiences that should be able to give even some ""seasoned"" couples food for thought."
5,Awesome,"Amazing book with great insights that brings together many of the concepts taught in Think and grow rich, As a manthinkith and many seminars I have attended."
1,can you spell metaphore,this book makes one point painfully over and over and over(if you have faith in god everything you ever want will just appear)dont waist your time.
5,"Discover the Secrets of How to Be, Do or Have Anything You Want","WOW! I just finished reading 'The Jackrabbit Factor' and wanted to share my thoughts about the simplicity and power of this book's message. Leslie Householder is truly a master story-teller and I just couldn't put the book down. She has brilliantly weaved in all the secrets I've ever learned about how to tap into the extraordinary power of your mind to be, do or have anything you want. 'The Jackrabbit Factor' lays out in narrative form a simple yet powerfully effective blueprint that virtually anyone can follow in order to consciously create their own circumstances and transform their lives. I moved so quickly through the story that by the end, I felt like I had been talking to a friend for a few hours, instead of reading. A unique, uplifting and transformational book!"
3,"OK, but not for MT13","This tray was purchased for a new MT13 ladder. Although it does provide a very sturdy step, it cannot be used as described with the MT13 in standard stepladder configuration. The step is supposed to fold away while you climb the ladder and then be opened with your foot. In order to descend, the reverse process is needed. The problem is that you are directed to step up to the next highest rung in order to fold/unfold the stand behind you. However, the MT13 in standard stepladder configuration does not have a higher step.We are getting around this by using a small step stool placed next to the MT13 to gain access to the step, but are unable to use the fold/unfold option. The step is far safer and more comfortable than standing on the normal ladder rung. However, think twice before purchasing this for the MT13 ladder."
3,Comfort Step? Maybe. Tool Tray? No.,"This item is easy to install and remove. However, despite its claim, it is not a tool tray or a paint tray. I purchased this for use with a Werner MT26 but there are far better tool trays available for this ladder."
3,"Great desgin, made in China and it shows","Firstly, the layout and design of this product is very well thought out and for the money I paid I suppose it is a reasonable good deal.I had a missing rivet in a non crucial area and this, while inspecting the other rivets I noticed numerous inconsistencies in how they were inserted into frame.One complaint I would have about the ladder itself is that it is pretty heavy; my wife could never handle this on her own. Depending on the application of your ladder this could be a problem. We thought we would use it while painting the inside of our home but we soon realised that moving as often as we needed to was very burdensome for such a heavy ladder."
4,Villa Lobos from Brazilians,There's nothing quite like a Brazilain ensemble to bring these amazing pieces to life - like the music itself the passion and fantasy outway any minor imperfections. The music benefits form an all-or-nothing approach - i loved every minute.
3,This is a personal journal of sailing during the 1980 winter,"The author has taken his personal cruising journal of a past period, the winter of 1980-81 and has created a book that documents his thoughts and activities in a chronological fashion. Although it does provide insight into his life and career in sailing journalism, it does miss the mark in terms of usual ideas for the would be island sailor today. The book does provide good armchair cruising although I personally found it a slow read. The author does provide some useful tips on various anchorages in the Virgin Islands but the text does not provide much island detail outside a brief stay in Antigua. It probably is far removed from the cruising patterns of the typical sailor who is cruising the Carribean basin on a realistic budget. At any rate, it was enjoyable reading and certainly provides insight into the author's family and cruising friends"
3,Good but gathers dust,"This is a good book. It has topics for everyone, but it is for the more advanced user. I like database stuff (every jobs gotta have it) and this book spends enough time on that subject. I wish he would have got rid of this ""on the CD"" stuff that is included in the table of contents because it miss represents the topics in the book (give a table somewhere 'cause I didn't notice it when I bought it). I really liked the DirectX stuff."
1,Complete waste of money,"This product could not have been more disappointing. The first time I used it for my Halloween party, the mold broke into pieces as soon as the water froze. They market it as a ""durable multiple use product"", which could not be farther from the truth! If youre going to spend the money for a one-time use luge, you can get a much better one than this!"
2,"good, but could be better","This is a great idea, but it could be better. I just did a quick search and found LugeCubes, another mold that is modular. When you put it together the luge is 2 ft high... very cool!"
1,Epic Party Fail,"So this was a great idea as a reusable Luge for a party, but it is a super pain to get out of the mold not to mention the constant cracking. And with a melting block of ice sitting on an angled piece of plastic with nothing holding it there look out for the luge to slide off and shatter. Better off getting a one time use and calling it a day (much better success with the single use ones). Every time I have used one it has SERIOUS problems, of which I don't experience at all with the single use molds. Try searching for the mold from ""Lugez"" works great!"
1,"Fun, but poor craftsmanship","I bought this item in anticipation of a wild evening with friends. Logistically, this item is difficult to prepare, especially if you have a small freezer. The width of my freezer could not accommodate the tray, so I had to use my neighbor's freezer, which was a pull out drawer. You cannot fill the entire tray with water, or you will get it everywhere. Instead, you fill it half way, then add the rest by hand via glasses of water. The mold came out looking ok, but cracked as soon as I tried to remove the ice. They should have constructed it with a stronger plastic. Additionally, the pegs should be longer. The angle is far too shallow to get an experience of reasonable length. I ended up having to place books under the pegs to elevate the luge so people weren't standing there for 10 minutes waiting for the liquor to come down the shoot."
1,Cheep Plastic,This product is fun but it only worked once before it broke. Also when it melts the water just hits the floor. in turn making all the towels you have wet.
1,Luge is a LOSER,"I was very unhappy with this product. I made the Luge 3 times and all 3 times the product had problems. I followed the directions and I know that it is not that difficult, It is sorta like the book ""How to Boil Water"". The main and difficult problems that I had was getting it out of the tray. Plus freezing it so it comes out level. We followed the directions. The on the third time the plastic gave way and cracked and I ended up not having the Luge at my party. I was pretty upset but I didn't let that get in my way of having a good time."
5,introduced tons of fun,This product was introduced to many people and provided entertainment. It will be continued to be used at social gatherings!
1,Dont waste your money,"Not worth the $20.. Find a local place that does Block Ice and make your own luge. The plastic container is cheap and doesnt carve out trails well and the mouths are too close. In the NY/CT area, try the Icehouse of danbury, thats the only place I know who does block ice around here."
1,Great idea poor design,"I have to say once the first shot goes down and the edge is wet and melting all the shots are going to dribble down the edge and not into the glass. I would also make it so that you could make each side by itself it takes up less freezer space and you could run one luge at twice the length. When filling make sure it is as flat as possible because if it freezes with any lump/bump it will almost never sit ""safe"" enough in the tray.Overall I was not happy with this.Not worth the money."
2,"Fun, But It's a One Time Use Product","I read the review by someone else that warned it was a one-time use product, so I was really careful when I dumped the ice block out of the mold. I ran hot water over the top to loosen it up a bit. It came out reasonably easy and it was fun at the party. However, I just went to fill it up again and there is a hole in the mold now so it's basically useless.If you don't mind spending the ~$20 for a one time use thing, it's pretty good. But if you want to use it more than that, you will be very lucky to be able to do so."
1,Sounds more fun than it really is,"The mold broke the first luge I made. Then when removing the ice luge, it broke in half. Made another one after a temporary repair on the mold. Difficult to get the luge to stay on the holder, ice melts fast (it was only 46 degrees outside) towards the bottom and makes it difficult to get shot into glass at bottom. Shot glasses started at the top as full and by the time it went through the luge and into the shot glass (after spilling) shot glass was only half full. Sounded like a great party idea but I was disappointed and would not recommend."
2,"Fun, but only if you skip the shot glasses","I bought one of these at Urban Outfitters, and thought how fun it would be to have an ice luge at a party! It's very important that it freezes on a level surface, but there's no way anything you pour down the chutes will end up in a glass like the picture suggests.If you're throwing a party with really close friends that don't mind sucking off the same block of ice, this is the ice luge for you."
1,luge is a loser,"We froze this three times. Once it cracked upon loosening it. It got bubbles in it that prevented the booze from flowing down the path. We used a small torch to attempt to improve it, which ice carvers do, and we still couldn't make it work as the pathways are too shallow, and there is no lip or funnel design at the end of the run to place your glass under. So the liquid just runs all over the place. It's a loser."
2,"Great gift idea, but flimsy product","I got this luge as a birthday gift...So excited to ry it out at the next party - definitely takes a few days to freeze and takes up a lot of space in the freezer so be prepared. The base cracke the first time it was used, and had a hard time getting the ice to mount in the first place. Got about 4 shots out of it total before it was a wet, melting mess. Unfotunately the luge isn't long enough to chill the alcohol, either - so start with something cold! Pretty disappointing product."
1,Cod fever!,"In this lusty tale of cape cod's lush countryside, Thoreaumanages to do everything wrong! I give it a two only because ofThoreau's thorough description of a beaver frolicking in a pond."
5,Hilllary Rubin is the new face of yoga,"The DVD is incredibly well done and properly planned for user interaction. I have followed the rise and success of Hillary Rubin and would absolutely recommend her uplifting, motivational and spiritual mindset as it applies to yoga and life in general. If there is a Hillary Rubin product, DVD, book or other, BUT IT. You will not be disappointed."
5,Awesome DVD!,"This dvd was very enjoyable and one every Elvis fan should add to their collection. Mike Freeman takes you to many of the places Elvis visited and hung out in Memphis. Everything from Humes high school to Circle G ranch to the places he lived to a restaurant he frequented is covered in this dvd. The indepth conversation with George Klein is very enjoyable and the ""roll story"" made me laugh. Basically, if you ever wanted to know the places Elvis frequented or just wanted a new fun and informative dvd on Elvis...this is a must!"
3,Artist receives no royalties from this album.,"This is Billy Vera. Although this is a pretty good album of mine, from 1976, I receive no royalties, either as the singer or songwriter from it. I will leave it to the conscience of my fans as to whether you wish to support a company that does not pay the artist.Billy Vera"
2,Better than nothing,"....that's about what it was worth. It was helpful for some things that I didn't have a particularly good background in. However, you HAVE to have an earth science background to do well on the actual exam. Also, the sample questions are not at all similar to the ones on the exam. I have yet to receive my scores. So, this review is totally about how prepared I was for the exam. I found the Earth Science Regents Review book by Barron's and the practice guide provided by the testing agency to be the best. Also, you must read the basis for the exam. There are lots of questions on the test that are within the parameters presented there but not on any practice test that I took before the exam."
3,Another LDS Comedy,"There are a ton of LDS comedies out there, but this was one of the least impressive ones. I did chuckle a few times but it seems they are running out of things to joke about.It was okay and worth watching once (if you are into LDS satires), but it had so much lost potential. Especially since this was made by the same people as Singles Ward. The only thing I really enjoyed was the performance by Kirby Heyborne.If you are looking for a LDS comedy I would suggest several others over this one. However, if you've seen them all then there is no reason to not see this one as well."
1,Not sexy.,"Men here is a tip. If you want to please your lady, use a sexy thong instead. We love how a man looks in a thong."
2,There are Better Options,"The waistbands on some of the pairs I own have rolled down, and no amount of ironing seems to be able to straighten them out. Oddly, this seems to affect the blue and gray pairs. Of the four black pairs I bought, only one has this problem. I also had a seam fail on one of the eight pairs I bought.I have since bought some boxer briefs from Nordstrom that have held up much better, with no rolling in the waistband. I'm going to start replacing these Calvin Kleins with Nordstroms. Maybe not as chic, but it's better than having a rolled waistband digging into your hip."
5,Best Boxer brief out there.,"Calvin Klein underwear is the best. The regular boxers are very spacious and comfortably soft. The boxer brief is more form fitting but not tight and just as soft as the full boxer. Extra large fits a 6 foot 2, 190 pound, 34-36 inch waist man just fine."
3,I used to like these,I used to like this product until I found 2-xist - I like the briefer style of 2-xist.
2,Only so-so,"Comfortable only for the first wearing. The waist band on these rolls very easily and then even repeated washing, and ironing can't take the roll out. Otherwise, well made and they tend to wear well."
5,CK Boxer Briefs are worth it!,"Tried other brands like Hanes and that was a bad idea! Hanes use some cheap material and it tears easily. Calvin Klein material is the best, these doesn't draw up in the waist band or lose it's shape or form, so these can last longer. Definitely recommend! If you want your stuff wrapped up nice then buy Calvin Klein!"
1,Bulky head.,"The head portion of this brush is enormous, I have trouble moving it around the outside of my teeth where my cheeks are. The brush also feels like it lacks power compared to other electronic brushes. This was recommended by my dentist, but I still have no clue why."
2,brushes overpriced and don't last,The head is OK but the brushes are overpriced and they are crappily made and designed and don't last.
3,"great for some, with personalized training only","My take as a professional. I have been using it with patients for over 10 years: It is only for very motivated, dexterous patients who are willing to take the time to LEARN how to use it and be trained how to use it in a dental office. It is a lot like a hygienists handpiece, only it is battery powered and uses brushes not cups. The hygienists are taught how to use it as part of school. This is the only way it should be sold. Using it improprerly as most do even without training it is not effective. It often takes 2,3, 4 sessions before the patient gets it, but when they do it it works great and can do things that other brushes can't."
4,After reading the reviews about the Rotodent I almost didn't buy. now I'm glad I did. I had my first Rotodent foy 20 yrs,"I have had a Roto Dent for twenty years,and dropped it on the tile floor. I Looking on line to read about the Roto Dent and was worried after reading the reviews. I took a chance and not only was the new Roto Dent an excellent choice but the transaction went through with out a hitch. Love the Roto Dent and the fast delivery from Teeth N Things."
4,Very good product,I have being used mine for 7 years and it is in very good condition. I just bought two more for my children because I have tried a lot of brands and the dentist told us they were not doing a good job with the cleaning. My children say they feel their teeth very clean now. They only use it at night because it takes a little time brushing their teeth. As everyone says the head is very expensive. If you feel the battery is not lasting is because you need to replace the head. It happens with the heads you buy on ebay which I think they are not the originals. If you replace the head it works like a new battery. I would say It is the best electrical one I have had and I think is the only one that spins like the one used by the dentists.
4,Good product but a little pricey,"After brushing too hard for years, my gums receded and I got the Zila. I should have had it years ago. I alternate between using it and a manual toothbrush; it helps to have a choice. The brush speed is gentle. Customer service is excellent. The only drawback is that the cost of replacing a brush head, which only lasts about one or two months, is 15 dollars!!"
5,STATE OF THE ART,THIS IS A ROTATORY MACHINE LIKE YOUR DENTIST USES. THIS ONE COMES WITH A ONE YEAR WARRANTY. IT IS ALSO AVAILABLE AT MANY DENTIST'S OFFICES AND SOLD THERE WITH A LIFETIME WARRANTY. THE WARRANTY DOES NOT COVER THE WALL CHARGER BEYOND ONE YEAR BUT REPLACEMENT IS NOT MUCH . FOR WARRANTY THEY JUST SHIP YOU A REPLACEMENT AND YOU PAY ABOUT $8 SHIPPING. MUCH BETTER THAN THE VIBRATING POWER BRUSHES SOLD AT STORES.
1,Replacement brush tips impossible to find!,"Before you buy this toothbrush, try to find replacement brush heads (plastic piece and brush tip); or just the brush tips. You can find the brush heads on the internet for $17-$25 EACH. While the brush tips are easily replaceable, and Rota-dent makes them, they are impossible to find, even at Rota-dents website. (I know they are made by the manufacturer because a dentist gave my wife two packages, because he was discontinuing carrying the product. That should tell you something!)My wife bought this toothbrush from her orthodontist. She likes it, but I'm ready to throw it out the window! It is fast becoming an expensive doorstop. The price for a brush head is ridiculous. Consumables should be much more readily available for an item that is this expensive initially, and should be reasonably priced. Rota-dent fails on both counts."
3,"Works ok, but the time & expense involved should be considered","My dentist told me i needed this too. ""The last toothbrush you'll ever buy!"" Great, sounds like a worthwhile investment at $125. And it does work ok, but i suspect that taking 5-8 minutes with it WOULD make a difference. Subsequent dental visits proved otherwise, I still have the gingivitis. The hygenist told me I should be using the Rotadent and seemed surprised when I told her I was. Perhaps that much time spent with a regular toothbrush would yield better results. Regardless, I own it now and am commited to it. Now that i need replacement heads, I'm astonished at the price. Not exactly proving to be ""the last toothbrush I'll ever buy!"" Think twice about this unit."
2,Uncomfortable,"As the previous reviewer says, I think you can only get this from your dentist, or at least I was told that by my dentist. So I'm a little surprised to see it listed here. I was satisfied with my old Oral-B but it was getting old and my dentist recommended the Rota-Dent One Step. So I bought it. I find it uncomfortable to use. It either tickles or causes an uncomfortable vibration that I can barely tolerate. It does clean well, but I've gone back to my old Oral-B."
1,Expensive Trap,"This toothbrush has been cleverly marketed directly through the dentists' offices at extremely high markups that are shared with the dentist by the manufacturer. Unlike the ""razor blade model"" that gives away the razor for free to lock you into purchasing expensive blades, this is a double whammy: 1. Unlike the razor, Rotadent is outrageously priced because it is only comparable to the cheapest models from Oral B or Sonicare that cost one fifth (20%) the price of a Rotadent. 2. Furthermore, the ""blades"" or the brush heads, that the dentist recommends replacing every 3 months, are equally outrageously marked up."
2,big problems with technical information,"This book has a lot of big ideas, but is very weak on technical details. The author repeatedly uses phrases like, ""We tried this, but it didn't work very well"" without offering a follow up of something that DOES work. Maybe some of the suggestions would work better in an arid climate, but around here many of his suggestions are recipes for mold growth, rot and indoor air quality problems. Also, much of what is suggested is in violation of building codes, such as using a single wall heat exchanger in a solar water heating system where the heat exchange takes place between glycol-based antifreeze and potable water. Use the book for ideas, but please get your technical information somewhere else."
3,Looking for info on Slipform (slip form) Stone Masonry?,"While the author is a knowledgeable on the subject, if you are looking for a book that covers the slipform (slip form) stone masonry in greater detail then check out Tomm Stanley's book ""Stone House: A Guide to Self-Building With Slipforms"". The material is covered in greater detail and in a well thought out manner."
1,"slapped together, poor effort","I had expected with a title like Living Holmes: Thomas J. Elpel's Guide to Integrated Design and Construction a scholarly and practical book. Instead it strikes me as someone who put this together to make a quick buck.The review by Charlamaine Taylor, you should realize that they are in business together (see my review of their video on slipform walls).I cannot speculate on a persons motivations for writing, you can get some good information from the book, but my best recommendation is to view this book and his distributer Charlamaine Taylor with caution. We need less hastily produced books and more informative professionally produced books"
5,This is the best book I've read on Free Masonry,"John Robinson outdid himself, which I didn't think possible after Born in Blood. His explanation, in clear terms, of the opposition to Masonry on religious grounds is especially insightful. It is a great book with an especially bad and misleading title."
3,"Good book, but not great","The writing style lacked the quality of some of the author's previous works (Born in Blood, Dungeons Fire & Sword). While his arguments were good, against opponents of Freemasonry, he adds a little too much emotion to those arguments. I must say that the description of some of the Freemason's (I'm not one) charitable works is very moving. That fact that Masons don't tout their good works is equally impressive."
2,Pilgrim Path,"Wasn't quite what I expected after ""Born in Blood and ""Dungeon, Fire and Sword"". Lot's of repitition from both books. Sorry"
4,A GREAT READ,"Talk to your friends and to your neighbors, and ask them what they think of the Freemasonry. I am sure that you will receive answers that are both positive and negative. Then, pick up this book and read it. If you are a person that loves to do good for people and for those in need then read about Freemasonry. Although, some things are left out this book does a wonderfuol job of protraying Masons.Mr Robinson, for example tells you a story about him going to a Shriners meeting. A little girl had severe burns all over her body. One man stood up and said that they needed to discuss what was in their budget for this little girl. Another Shriner stood and replied, ""No whatever this girl needs is our budget."" For those that feel Masonry is a negative. Is helping a burn victim a negative?Hurray for Mr Robinson. And, Greetings to all Masons reading this review. For I am not a Mason yet, but hope to be soon."
5,Outstanding read on Freemasonry,"Freemasonry and the Religious Right, by John J. Robinson is a fast paced and enjoyable read about Christian religious fundamentalism and Freemasonry.It shows a lot of the tactics used by Antis (anti-masons), and delves into the truth behind the lies that many anti-Masons (most notably Rev. Pat Robinson) mention such as ""Lucifer as God"", worship of Baphomet, and the strange belief that Freemasonry is a religion.Like Born In Blood, this book is in two parts. The first part details his investigations among the general public and with the antis themself.The second part of the book deals with his interactions with Masons and their families, and what Freemasons think of the anti-mason backlash.I suggest this for all Masons, and for people who might have heard negative things about Freemasonry, but still are not sure."
2,Hodgmen Waders lasted only 1 year,"I bought these waders in the Spring, and they worked great. I left them in the outdoor shed and the following Spring they were all cracked and trashed. Not sure why, as I have owned many pares of waders over the last 40 years and never had this problem on new waders. The only thing that I can think of is having had my boat nearby on a trickle charge over the winter."
5,"Cuts great, can't beat the price","If you're on a budget, these are terrific. They're not Freud, obviously, and they don't cut quite like Freud, but they're darn close enough for basic work. Just take care of them, and you'll be satisfied."
4,Interesting,"The critical matter of the book consumes almost half its pages, but the letters themselves are charming.The other review -- though very helpful -- seems to be literally retyped from Millicent Bell's excellent introduction to the book. The phrases are exactly the same. Hello? A Reader? Is your name Millicent?"
3,SNL Bad Boys DVD,Some of it was not very funny. It had some humorous parts but not enough to keep me watching.
3,Feel a bit mushy!,"Got these for BP based on price. After about 2 months of BP, find these don't fly nearly as far as other 44/375 balls. In the BP bag I have Thunders and Sharks, and they typically fly about another 40-60 feet. They seem to be OK as far as durability..."
3,Not much new here,"I felt there was not much new on this album from John. I sure liked Darren's remix of 108 Grand's; Te Quiero track. Overall it is a fine album, but not a must buy.I give it three stars, which is quite ok. One another reason for not getting more starts is that it's not a double album like many of the competing ones..."
3,wha?!?!,"man i have to jump on the wagon with this set. i am probably the last of the original(pre groove, at least five years) john digweed fans to get this mix so late(thanx ups) and in a sense i am glad. since ive already studied the reviews enough times while waiting, instead ofthrowing a fit when i heard this mix i sat back and just listened. being that i dont really anticipate too many compilations coming out having been around the block and back for so long and doing my own thing now, every sound is old but one and although there are some tracks that are really great and rare and well, nonexistant...i am sure me and the vast majority of true diggers fans hope that amazing 2 am signature sound isnt extinct."
5,Digweed Delivers,"I'm a big house/trance DJ fan. But Digweed and Sasha sets are the only ones I can listen to again and again and again.The thing I like about Digweed is that no two of his disks are the same. You never know what to expect - except the unexpected and a high quality set. Some people have called MMII ""boring."" What would have been boring is if he'd churned out a clone of his stunning but brutal Global Underground LA set.Digweed isn't that dull. Beautiful, strange, and ultimately uplifting, this disk may well be his best effort yet."
4,OK...not as good as Los Angeles,"see title of review, if you want some good digweed, go for los angeles, though this one is alright. Didn't have a track that I wanted to play over again, overall its OK and the mix and transitions are typical great digweed. for the price, good deal, came exactly as described, would use this seller again."
3,Digweed does Chill,"Digweed has always had a bit of dark, subliminal tone to his stuff, but this takes it to an extreme. Those looking for a dance mix can look elsewhere. This is a chill mix that is probably best listened to in a dark room through headphones. I admit, this was not what I expected and I was a little put off at first. But taken on its own merits, this is a fine CD. Digweed's ear is still great and his textures are rich and interesting. And there is a kind of ""way down deep"" groove that emerges. But you won't find the kind of high point ecstasy of a trance or house mix here."
2,What happened?,"Is what I would like to know. Not up to par for Digweed. And I have seen him spin and listen to his radio show all the time, and he is the man. This cd is bland, lifeless and just average, which is really not necessary for someone with his skill and selection set. Oh well, disappointment for a long awaited cd after his great LA set. Don't buy."
2,Digweed shows his chill out side,Warning: if you are looking for another Digweed progressive house style look somewhere else. This one is more of a chill out album than his Global Underground releases.Im not saying it is a bad album. It's just that Im not into the chill out style of dance music out there. It does have some nice ambient trance like feel to it but that is about it. This one is really for the true Digweed fans out there. So if your looking for something to bob your head or dance your bottom off then you'll be dissappointed.
1,Not what I expected,If you listen to this CD you will not believe that John Digweed came out with something like this. This type of music is completely different to what he has done before. I cant understand why he would do such a thing. His music was the best and now it has turned for the worst. Very dissapointed
1,failed experiment,"i have been listening to digweed for years with his collaborations w/ sasha, his bedrock productions as well as his solo work (as well as seeing him live at spundae) and this effort is unbeleivably bad. it would be much easier to understand if it was bad because of taking chances, but this is bad because it is boring. absolutely no risk taking and completely spineless.don't buy this..."
5,A Well Articulated Roadmap--By Those Who Have Been There,"This book is an outstanding compilation of 31 articles, by current and past organizational leaders, futurist, authors, etc., who share their knowledge and experiences. As they point out, the leader of the future must be serious about communication and not just pay it lip-service, they must share as much of their power, as possible, with members in the organization to make it a more powerful organization. This open communications and power sharing leads to a learning organization, that is inculturated to adapt to the changing enviornment and more importantly help ""lead-turn"" the organization to ensure a sustained competitive advantage."
5,Most excellent - (hide it from your kids!),"Legend of the Overfiend just plain ol' kicks bootie! If your easily offended or squeamish, I REALLY wouldn't watch this. But if you like anime, and don't mind a little nudity, brutality, or destruction, look no further. This movie blew my mind, the graphics and story line are excellent. If you like Akira, your going to love this! I read other peoples reviews of this movie and bought it, and am glad I did. You won't be dissapointed! :)"
1,Pure Anime Hell!!!!!,"I could not sit by and watch this monumental pile of garbage get five star reviews. I've been watching Anime for eight years, and this is one of the worst I have seen. The flimsy plot is completely drowned by triple X rated pornoraphic rape scenes. If you have the intelligence of a small woodland creature, or are a pubescent sadist with a jar of vaseline and a box of tissues, then this movie is for you. Sex and violence are great , but if I wanted to watch a porno, it would not be animated porn!!. If they would have pursued the destruction of three worlds to create one plot line, instead of plumming the depths of depravity it might have been good."
3,"Did someone say ""non-gratuitous sex scenes?""","I hate to burst some people's bubbles, but I can't sit this one out. The way I understood it, this movie's plot was have sex, turn into big, demon things, and destroy the world. I have to admit that it has more of a plot than some other, well-received anime movies that I have seen. It has quite an interesting plot. Saving the three worlds by destroying them and making them into a new, single world is relatively refreshing. If they had cut out some of the myriad sex scenes it would have been much more interesting. I don't mind sex scenes, but seeing sex scenes for most of the movie does not appeal to me. On the up-note it does have really good animation. The scenes are fairly realistic and very well-drawn."
2,Mini-DVD's have limits,"The reviews here are well done and pretty comprehensive. Check out the CONs before you buy. The Mini-DVD's won't go in my Macbook, which I should have realized before buying. I thought for sure I could pop the dvd's in and use Handbrake to grab the clips. You can't, and only 15 minutes of HD video on a DVD is not practical at all...AND -- I'm also VERY disappointed because my camera died 91 days after I bought it, which means it costs me $165 (plus tax and shipping) to send the camera to Texas to get it fixed. I bought it in Feb. 2009 for $359.00"
4,Cool Movie Camera!,The Sony HDR-UX5 is a decent little HD video recorder. It's light and very easy to use. Transferring the AVCH format was tricky at first but I learned that not setting the camera at it's best setting made it a lot easier to edit on the computer.
2,Carrie Underwood Karaoke,"I bought this specifically for ""I'll Stand By You"" which I was hoping could be used to be sung at my wedding. However, the key is higher than Carrie's version, and WAY too fast. I was a bit disappointed, and am trying to find another version, if anyone know of one."
3,Not as advertised,The CD itself is great but a bonus track is advertised and there is no bonus track.
1,Poor in detail. Wrong exit numbers. Confusing layout. Avoid this atlas!,"I bought this at a quickie mart in Florida after we moved here and have since found it VERY difficult to use. The exit numbers are the wrong, old numbers (as another reviewer points out). In addition, the maps are sparse on detail and confusingly laid out. There are map numbers and page numbers and the adjoining edges are marked with map numbers, not page numbers, so you have to find the maps yourself. Everything in the book is done this way.Although I had hoped for a Thomas Bros. map (Look them up for California -- They're the best!), the company doesn't do Florida. I'm ordering the Delorme atlas today. It seems to be the only one that ISN'T published by American Map (A division of Langenscheidt, I'm surprised to learn).-- D"
2,"Started out OK, but...","The recent film ""The Illusionist"" was said to borrow heavily from this book, so I snatched it up. As can happen, the movie was better than the book. It's an interesting work, but doesn't really go anywhere with its story. Buy the DVD, forget this."
5,simply amazing,"funny, i've never heard of this group until a few weeks back when i was just doing my random cd buying and if it wasn't for the fact that they had this cd in the bargain bin, i wouldn't have looked twice! but the minute i listened to this album, i was hooked. one of the best to come out with nu bossa, horizontally reclining sounds which is getting hyped up lately. there're no bad tracks in this album but you might want to check out lovin' you, piece of my heart, no evil mind and my favorite, einfach leben. the singer's voice reminds me a little bit of smoke city vocalist though but all the same, it's a great album and a winner all around."
5,I know they are brilliant,"Jazzamor are german, if you like that album, you should look for Lazy Sunday Afternoon!Their first one! Less electronic but with piano sounds!"
2,They don't hold charge and lifecycle is too short,These batteries will not hold a charge for long on the shelf. You're lucky if you can store charged ones more than a week. This means you have to charge them right before you use them. It also means that if you have a low drain device you want to use them in you'll still have to recharge the batteries after a week or so. I also noticed that they quickly loose their capacity after too few cycles meaning you have to throw them out. The Eneloop batteries are much better.
1,Bad quality,It did not hold the charge for long. Bad quality battery from Sony.I was so mad I throw them away.
5,lasts all day,"I take about 700 - 1000 photos a day (640x480)res. with a olympus sp-550uz.These sony batteries charge quicky (I bought the sony quick charger) and they will last you an entire day or more.Buy these batteries if you take a lot of photos, they are worth it.I bought these to replace a set of cheap ""power 2000"" rechargable batteries. (amazon sells these also, I got the ""power 2000"" batteries free and they were not even worth charging or using. They consitently died after about 150 photos.)"
3,"Batteries great, case overrated","I like the batteries, Sony's chargers and batteries are very satisfactory. Buy the batteries.The key-ring case is overrated. It works ok but is flimsy and I don't expect it to last. It also isn't very secure with four batteries in it.Buy the batteries. Don't spend any extra on the slide case."
5,excellent deal,This is a very good deal. Th capacity of the batteries is very good with 2500 mAh. Lasts really long. I use it with my DSC-H5 camera.
3,Too expensive and dont last long,These are too expensive and dont last long before needing to be charged again. When fully charged they still arent powerful at all.Ive gone back to buying regular batteries because of the lack of power.
1,Batteries are supposed to be standardized,I have two Ni-MH chargers and sony batteries won't charge in them. They probably use some proprietary technology to prevent using other brand chargers. They force you to buy their own non-standard charger that probably won't again charge other brand batteries. And of course this is not mentioned anywhere. No wonder these batteries are the cheapest. Don't waste your money or support Sony's attempt to bring non-standard products into a standardized market. Soon we have to carry bunch of chargers instead of the good old times when just one was enough.
5,Great for my digital camera,These batteries have been awesome. My digital camera uses 4 of them at a time and they last for 100's of photographs. Flash recharge is very quick. Highly recommended.
2,Rechargeable batteries,Like these but you really need to charge no more than 24 hours prior to use otherwise they are prone to die very quickly or have lost their charge all together.
5,"One of the best children's book, in any language","I first found Sven Nordqvist, and his wonderful books while working as an Au-Pair in Germany, where he's extremely popular. Imagine my surprise when I got back to the U.S. and couldn't find his books _anywhere_ in English. I haven't read ""Pancake Pie"" in English, but the story is delightful in German--for both children and adults, and the pictures are great no matter what language you speak."
2,Boring,"If the characters spent less time in their heads rethinking the same time over and over the book would be 1 chapter. The action lasts 5 seconds and the characters are weak. The first book was seriously stuck in f*&k and c*&k land it was used every other sentence. Not bothered by crude language but it was overused especially towards the end. Felt like the author was running out of something better to say so use filler. Not impressed, not even a good mix of sci-fi and action. The characters get stuck in their heads thinking about their mates and can't stop admiring them over and over - again feels like filler. Read the first book and tried to read the second book but it's just not holding my interest the story doesn't move just spins around then some action is thrown in."
2,"""Barely ok""","After reading this book several times to find the hidden deep, and profound 'wisdom', I gave up. Sure, this was an interesting book- even though it contained only 60+ pages. I actually bought it through an ad. which made promises of wisdom, wealth, understanding, etc., etc., etc.. Like I said this book was okay. My biggest gripe was that I paid ..., hardly a deal. At Amazons price this book is worth the money and the time required to read it. In my book however, this book still rates just two stars."
5,"The finest album so far, by the finest player around","Doug Smith's music is very accessible, yet complex. His playing is perfection, yet his technique is not in-your-face virtuosity. Like Mozart and Bach, his tunes are the kind you can hum along with, yet they reward repeated listenings. I enjoy Doug's music so much that I made the trek (pilgrimage?) to Portland just to take some lessons from him. That's how much I think of this man's music. So my advice to all lovers of acoustic guitar is: BUY EVERYTHING DOUG SMITH HAS RECORDED! Other top recommended CD's are Order of Magnitude and Alone Again. If there were any justice in the world, Doug Smith would be a household name."
4,A Very Enjoyable Read,"This is my fourth Dicey Deere mystery I've read and I wasn't disappointed! Most of the story goes pleasantly along.........untilnear the end, when everything gets solved rather fast! I did wish there was more character development......I like to ""know"" thecharacters. Also, the 'slave trade, DNA' etc, seemed a little far-fetched for a small Irish village. Except for that, thiswas a very enjoyable read. Now to look for another Dicey Deere book!"
2,Smug and Self Absorbed,"Once again, the cover art is the best part of the book. The characters continue to be very shallow and one dimensional, the plot goes way out in left field - way way out - to the point of the ridiculous. Slave trading and DNA in the 1650s just is a bit of a stretch in a charming Irish village? The Torrey Tunet character is shallow and smug, and cozy mystery lovers won't find much charm in this tome."
2,Pure Drudgery,"Good god, this book is pure drudgery to read.I was looking for an engaging description of how FL evolved from being the no man's land of horse breeding to a significant factor.This book was pedantic and dull. Example (assume horses X & Y are both FL-bred):""Horse X won $600 dollars that year. Horse Y won $25. The grand total of FL horse earnings that year was $625.""Durrr...thanks for the rudimentary math lesson. Basically 1/3 of the sentences in this book could be discarded without loss of information. I never made it beyond chapter 4.The tome does contain many excellent historical pictures."
5,early example of outer space end of the century Sherwood dub,"The usual Sherwood suspects (Prince Far I, Bim Sherman et. al)in some early examples of his dub style. They were all released on ten inch singles originally. Some of the synth stuff sounds dated (ie casio-ish) now, but the soul is still there and I'd recommend this to anyone who likes Lee Perry, King Tubby, Laswell etc."
5,Beautiful relationship with nature,What a God give gift to communicate with such beautiful animals. Such a lesson of the great kindness that touches the soul of Gods great creation.
5,A horse owners must!,Simply perfect...moving and informative. I saw the film and also went to a clinic before reading this book. I still couldn't put it down. Buck is an inspiration. Thank you.
3,Faraway Review,"It was an ok book, not what I was expecting. I'm not sure I bought the book I thought I was. I was looking for a book with the horse's perspective of training. My fault."
4,He does have some adventures,"I like the book, it is interesting. I am drawn to keep reading to see what's next in Buck's life. I also keep reading to see if there are any tidbits that might help me to be a better horse person. If you are looking for a good read for enjoyment then this is okay but if you are looking for a book about training or re-training a misbehaving horse then this is not the book you are looking for."
5,Great book,The first horse clinic I ever went to was a buck brannaman clinic. I wad about 8 yrs old and I admire him and his family.
4,Wonderful story,"I love the cadence of this book, a good read! I enjoyed his journey with various horses and his life. I recommend this book, not as a guide to training, just as a trainer's story."
3,The Faraway Horses,A brave insight into the childhood and early adulthood of the author. Inspirational reading.
1,Shame On You Buck,"Pretty good story, too bad I found out from this book that Buck was the horse technical advisor on the the movie The Horse Whisperer. That movie was another awful Hollywood misrepresentation and misleading work on horses and horse training. It's a shame that a real horseman like Buck could be a part of such garbage. Maybe someday Hollywood and a real horseman will get together to make a movie that shows the real nature of horses and horsemanship.12/21/11 Update: Buck's no real horseman at all and he proved it in the movie ""Buck"". Buck's mishandling of a stallion in the film resulted in a man getting bit in the face and the stallion given the death sentence. A real horseman keeps people safe and saves horses lives. Buck is just a show-off that knows a few tricks to exploit horses and people that don't know much about horses to make a buck. If you really want to learn about horse behavior and horse training read ""Equitation Science"", by Paul McGreevy."
5,"a beautiful honest story-about horses, yes, but truly about humans","The faraway Horses is what the author's young daughter refered to when she spoke of her father's job that took him away so often. As a horselover, trainer, teacher etc.. the term rang true to how faraway we can get, horse and equine alike, from where we want and need to be. Buck Brannaman's stories are introspective and beautifully told. A powerful book moving and beautiful."
3,An easy read....,"I laud Buck's philosophies about life and horsemanship. I had a hard time as a child, nothing like Buck's by any means, but I agree. It may shape who you become to some degree, but you have the choice to become what you want to be as an adult. I am always looking for ways to connect better with my horse and would love to attend one of Buck's clinics, but almost feel guilty taking him from his family."
5,Book about life,"Great book.Not only for horsemen and horsewomen, as it is about life in general.Highly recommended."
5,Great Book Great Man,One of the most insiring books about Natural Horsemanship and any instructor that I have ever read. I wish I had read it before I took a clinic with Buck. I most certainly will continue to Study with him when ever possible and with the instructors he has taught. Ricky Quinn & Paul DietzThank you Buck for all that you are and all that you do for us and our Horses we love and revere so very much.Donna PetermannGilbert Arizona
4,A continuation of the T.V.show,"This is a more complete story of Buck's life.For horse people,it reflects a common sense approach to dealing with horses and people.If you have seen the show,it is a little repetitive.."
4,Happy with Canon,This is our second Canon and we have generally been really happy. We got this one as a cheaper Multi-Function and I am happy with what it does.Copying - Does better than expected.Scanning - Seems to do a great job also.Printing - Very fast and happy with itThe only thing I am disapointed with right now is the fact that the ink seems hard to find right now. My best luck so far was at Office Depot.
