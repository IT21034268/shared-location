5,Great Read!,"This book rekindled my desire to read all those books from High School, like Heart of Darkness, and Moby Dick, and Huckleberry Finn. It could use a bit of editing here and there, but so could Moby Dick! I loved all the literary references which rooted it in a deeper context, which is something we rarely see these days.The mixture of Guns & Roses references with Shakespeare quotes was humorous, artfully done, and insightful. I love both the band and the bard, and if you like either one, this book's for you. And the website's cool too. Bon voyage!"
1,My experience with this component was not good.,"I received the part promptly and packaged well. I installed the component in the vehicle and it worked for about a week before it failed. It appears there is a rubber seal in the discharge of the pump that should seal around the discharge line from the fuel pump and this seal popped out of place for some reason after about a week of being in service. After that, the seal would not remain in place.I purchased a replacement fuel pump from O'Rielly's and replaced this pump."
2,Brando and Maldon,"Brando and Maldon were not at their very best in this old timer ! Maldon was great in Patton, and Brando was excellent in Viva Zapata, one of my all time favorite Brando movies, along with him in Sayonara, with Red Buttons ... who won an Oscar for supporting actor."
5,one of the best books on algebraic topology,"This is a charming book on algebraic topology.It doesnt teach homology or cohomology theory,still you can find in it:about the fundamental group, the action of the fundamental group on the universal cover (and the concept of the universal cover),the classification of surfaces and a beautifull chapter on free groups and the way it is related to Van-kampen theorem .After reading this book you will have a strong intuitive picture on ""what is algebraic topology all about""(well at list on part of algebraic topology)read it an enjoy it!!!."
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed in this set. I was looking for movies that were family-friendly enough for my kids to watch. We have watched 2 and did not think either were what we were hoping for.Yes, they are cheap, but I would not recommend this set, no matter the price."
2,poor quality,This is poor quality dvd as it has waves in the movie and not clear. I only watched Family Thanksgiving and didn't try the other ones too disappointed in the one I tried.
3,added to the Christmas library,"Needed more holiday movies so this looked goodI have yet to play any of them, just wanted kids to have more shows to choose from."
2,Holiday Collector's set V.5,"I would give this item a 2 1/2. Of the four movies, two were quite good, the other two were just this side of ""unwatchable"". I'm not sorry to have the two good movies and even though all four movies are on one disc, the menu allows choice so you don't have to watch the less-than-good movies. I'm not sorry I purchased this."
2,ELVIS PRESLEY : The Back Story VOL 1 and 2,Being an Elvis fan I try to purchase any new Elvis dvd release.This dvd THE BACK STORY VOL 1 & 2 was a big disapointment.It is an exact copy of the dvd ELVIS THE MISSING YEARS the only difference is that the this dvd is made into a 2 volume set.Your better off buying ELVIS THE MISSING YEARS which has a bonus audio cd and is cheaper.If I had known this earlier I would not have bought this 2 volume set.
3,"required textbook, but not a great reference for the future","This course is required for one of my classes at the School of Public Health at Tulane University. The professor seems to think that we should find the long passages with long stories amusing. Frankly, though, the stories only make for long reading. If you are new to the subject then the stories help drive the concept home. If, however, the material is overlapping with other subjects studied in the past, it will seem boring."
1,"Earle Babble's, you sleep!","Guaranteed to cure the toughest cases of insomnia! Read a few pages in this book when counting sheep won't put you out. If this is the textbook for your class in Social Research, let me first offer my condolences to you; you are in for a long long semester! Earle will babble away for nearly 60 pages a chapter. The information is presented in a boring, wooden, and hopelessly lifeless way. The occasional bad joke only makes reading the chapters more painful. I can easily sit and read chapter after chapter in most text books, but I often found myself falling asleep after reading less than 20 pages in many of the chapters. Thankfully, I had a wonderful teacher, so she was able to explain much of what Earle couldn't to save his life. I'm glad this is behind me now, but I can't help but grumble when I think back to all the times I would wake up, face first in this book, hair matted and pages well salivated. ZZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
4,Good Intro,"This is a good intro for non specialists in the matter.How to do a Research Proposal, how a scientific social research has to be done, etc. There are very good points in this, however, it would be a good adding to give a real example of a program and its complete evaluation in roder to see the tools in action.Very good bookBestAldo"
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,It is marketed as a heavy tension but a little kid could easily bend this this thing and I could not be more disappointed! DO NOT BUY!!!
1,its not even a challenge!!!!!!,i dont recommend this product for adult men this product is for females or kids.....im not happy with the product i need a more heavy duty resistance
4,"Awesome, OUTDOES THE FIRST TWO!!!!","Even more excitement than the first 2. 2 flaws, they don't go to woodward and no Mat Hoffman, but other than that very cool."
4,The drink itself is good. but I don't like how it was shipped,"I'd reccomend it on taste and content. Does the job as an energy drink.But, I just got a 30 pack delivered from amazon and the cans were just placed in a cardboard box, meaning that they were free to move around. That's not a smart way to ship drinks! All the cans are dented and there's some leakage. Fortunately, its not too bad, but all the cans are sticky and one of them has a hole."
1,Dangerous as provided,"These would be just fine except for a critical flaw - the 1-inch screws that were provided were inexplicably too long for the bars to seat properly. Tried contacting Thule on-line (twice). The instructions had some drawings of the screws - presumably to scale at about 1/2 inch or so - however the actual screws that were provided were longer.The lack of proper seating (screws too long to completely tighten) means that these bars wobble and are unsafe - a serious accident waiting to happen.Half-inch screws would have made these ok - unfortunately these aren't provided (the Thule screws have specialized heads).Thule really needs to address this. These would have been simple to replace.Other than that, the rack system seems fine (except that the system doesn't accept existing bars from other Thule systems).But the screw length is a show-stopper."
2,"Somewhat interesting, but ....","While the soundtrack for this DVD is Stravinsky's famous ballet score called ""Le Sacre du Printempts"" [The Rite of Spring], the film is not the ballet story at all, except possibly for some common theme of redemption. The film plot is a rather different, surreal story, somewhat interesting, but hardly as compelling as Stravinsky's own ballet plot. If you're looking for Stravinsky's music with a ballet performance, this is NOT it. I wish someone would do the real ballet on DVD! This DVD may be interesting only for some film buffs."
1,Terrible visuals,Avoid this DVD...the visuals are laughable at best...It is a catalogue of cliches and there is NOTHING musical about the flow of the film...I found it annoying and wish I had never wasted my money....
1,"This needs a ""Parental Advisory"" label","First of all, the playing of the Berlin Philharmonic is brilliant. Now... the depiction of prostitution, naked dancing, and a gang rape should be enough of a reason to stay away from this. You've been warned."
5,Still Relevant,"This is a great book that proves the value of a determined citizen. Had Mrs. Ives just backed off and believed what she was told much of this information may have remained buried. Although this book speaks about ""long ago"" events it is still relevent today. Pick it up and read through, I bet you find more than one recongnizable political figure within the story."
3,Arkansas political corruption,"This investigative effort by journalist Leveritt is interesting, but the conversational style can be annoying for serious nonfiction. A ""cast of characters"" would have been helpful."
1,No pretty blooms here,"Boring writing; relies too much on flashbacks to tell her story. I was unhappy as well with her veiled ""fataphobia."" The ""bad boy,"" is typical, and the entire story did not hold my interest."
2,Not Worth It,"The mystery itself wasn't bad, although it was easy to figure out. However, the character of Abby had to be one of the most annoying I've come across, and because of her, a book that would normally take me two days to read took me more than two weeks.Abby's meddling was stupid. There was no reason for her to be involved in the first place, let alone keep putting herself in more jeopardy. And it wasn't just the meddling that was stupid -- Abby herself was stupid.I might give the series another chance down the line just to see if it improved at all. If not, I'll be done with it."
4,Quick and cozy,"Mum's the Word is a quick read with enjoyable, quirky characters. They are warm and familiar without being too archetypal. Abby Knight, our flower-shop-owner-turned-sleuth, is sometimes ditsy, but always funny! Her romantic foil, Marco, finds her both intriguing and infuriating, a trait he shares with every man who's ever been involved with a woman.If you like Janet Evanovich, give author Kate Collins a try."
3,Good Read,"I enjoyed this book for a summer read. It was not a fantastically laid out mystery that had me itching to discover the culprit, but the characters are endearing ane relateable. It took a while for me to become interested in the plot and not until 2/3rds the way through was I really turning pages. I found myself smiling as I read about the poor yellow vette and the capers of our heroine. This book is light, fun and loveable. I will probably read the next installment."
3,Fun and enjoyable read,"I would rate it 3.5 stars if I were able, actually. The characters are enjoyable, fun, and identifiable. The main character is spunky and adorable. The plot is decent, but there is not much new under the sun, so it is predictable to some extent. The action/danger involved keeps the book from being just ""ok"", but the budding romance/attraction seemed initially a bit forced and not introduced in a smooth way. However, I am looking forward to reading more from this author and recommend this book for cozy mystery readers who also like just a touch of action and romance."
3,Skip It!,"I love mysteries - but not this one. I can honestly say that it reminded me of the Nancy Drew series. I'd have absolutely loved this at 12-14 but now it was just a time waster. I will eventually try another and see if maybe it was just a funk I was in but, unless you enjoy the wholesome Nancy Drew mysteries, I'd skip these."
2,So so,"Most books have a place and this one would be entertaining on a long flight. But, there were many disappointments in the novel: the huge amount of unnecessary detail. Whether Abby likes her sandwiches with mustard or mayo neither advances the plot nor builds character -- just space filler. I was also shocked to find some grammatical errors -- ""forcing Nikki and I to cool our heels"" -- If writers don't understand pronouns, who does? Still, this book was loaned to me by a friend and I read it it cover to cover. That means it was okay."
3,Has Potential,"At first I didn't think I would get past the first chapter of this book - but, having purchased it, I pushed myself to read it. As I moved through the book, my interest increased and I have now decided that I will read the next to see if indeed it is a worthwhile series. The main character isn't the brightest, and that is my biggest issue. I love to read about smart, together women. Abby fauns all over the hot guy, takes quite a while to put two and two together, and takes risks that suspend belief. Her good qualities though, include her caring heart and her willingness to help people. If in the next book, she is written a little smarter - and less droolly over the hot guy, and maybe a bit more info about flowers and flower shops -I will continue to read these."
4,Flower Shop Series,"I really liked this book. It's not going to win a Pulitzer, but that is not why you read books like this! If you want a fun, easy read, this is it. However, the ending needs more closure. I was disappointed that not all the storylines were neatly packaged, (or at least semi-explained) at the end. It felt like there needed to be a few more pages of epilogue."
3,A liitle annoying,"I love mysteries and when I found this new series I was excited. After reading it I was very disappointed. The main character of Abby Knight is a little annoying. She finds herself in these ridiculous situations mainly because she doesn't take the advice of her friends, boyfriend or her family. On more than one occasion I wanted to strangle her myself. She keeps wondering why her flower shop isn't doing well, if she put as much time at work as she does trying to find a killer her store wouldn't be struggling. Read another one to see if this was just a bad start but the second was just as bad. They are actually hard to get through."
4,LIGHT FUN BOOK BUT HIT-AND-MISS SERIES---,"An enjoyable light read. Not my favorite series though as I have only enjoyed reading every other book. Books 1, 3, 5, and 7 were worth keeping in my library. The rest ranged from mildly annoying to out-and-out torture to finish and were happily given away."
2,Most Annoying Mystery,"The main character Abby came across as the most annoying character created. As a cozy mystery it was okay, but not very believable. Jeopardizing herself the way she did was foolish. Some of the other characters seemed more interesting than Abby. I will not buy anymore from this series."
2,too slow,Wow! What a slow paced book. It could have been consolidated down to 75 pages. Great detail from the author but not enough movement in solving the mystery.
4,Rhode Island customer,"This book is part of a pleasant series. It provides a couple of hours of pleasant distraction. It loaded well, was easy to read (print quality). I may read another one someday."
5,What a great book!,"What a great book! This is a story about Cat Kinsey, a girl, about 12 or 13. Cat is the fastest runner at Brownwood School, so naturally she wants to compete in the race. Cat wants to wear slacks while running, but her father thinks it unseemly for a girl to be wearing boy's clothes. Cat is so upset that she decides not to race at all. Cat finds a grove in the woods and decides to put some of her possessions there. Then, a boy named Zane Perkins, an Okie, comes to Brownwood. He won the race, so everyone at school eggs Cat and Zane to race, but Cat doesn't want to. Cat meets Sammy, Zane's little sister, playing in her grove, with ""Lillybelle"" (that's what Sammy calls Cat's doll). Cat and Sammy become great friends. But Sammy gets pneumonia and she is likely to die. Zane and Cat finally get to race, running for a doctor, but this time, it's not for fun or entertainment, but it depends on life or death. This book is one of my favorites, and I think many people would enjoy it."
3,Running for Someones Life,"Cat Running is one of the better books I have read. It is abouta girl ,Cat, who is in sixth grade going on seventh. Cat is a fastrunner and won the Brownwood school race last year. The race was easy last year but this year she is not running. She is not running because her father will not let her wear slacks like the other girls. There is also a new kid at school and his name is Zane. Zane is an okie ,as they call him. An okie is a junkie or a poor farmer or farmer's kid. Cat became very good friends with Zane's sister, Sammy, but not Zane himself. That is until Sammy is dying very quickly. I liked this book even though it was slow at times. If you like The Egypt game and other books by Zilpha Snyder then you would most likly like this book!"
2,B-O-R-I-N-G!,This book has no plot! All the Cat does in the book is run to different places. She also thinks she is very fast. Don't waste your money on this book
2,B-O-R-I-N-G!,This book has no plot! All Cat does in the book is run to different places. She also thinks she is very fast. Don't waste your money on this book
2,IT AIN'T EASY SPITTIN GREEN,"Somewhere in this low budget shocker there might be a plot, but it's so muddled and incoherent, one may just wonder what in the world went on. Needless to say, it's kind of a rip off of THE BODY SNATCHERS. Some alien beings have invaded the earth and they take over human's bodies in an effort to populate and conquer the earth...I think. Muscular Paul Sloan plays a convicted serial killer who is used to host the body of a ""friendly"" alien who is out to stop the hundred or so aliens invading us. Colleen Porch plays Logan, his earthly partner whose role is minimalized and romanticized, too. Writer/director Alex Villelonga plays Porch's enigmatic boss and mentor and Tony Denison shows up as the homicide detective investigating the murders. The movie is poorly lit and directed, and lots of padding too. Minimally entertaining."
4,i love chisel.,"chisel is one of the most under-appreciated bands from the late 90's. they were the new ""indie rock"" before the new indie rock actually became popular. it's a shame they are no longer around, because they were awesome live. they are catchy without being annoying, which is a pretty hard thing to master.even years after buying this album, i still play it every few months if i feel like dancing alone in my room."
2,Quick Read but not enough meat,"The dust jacket has a picture of the New York Stock Exchange on it. I should have realized that the book is written from a financial market perspective (Both authors are from the securities industry). Their knowledge of business backend systems seems to be limited. One quote: ""All enterprise resource planning systems are now designed to be fully EDI compliant and XML capable."" If only that were true. I would recommend the book to people who are thinking about starting a b2b exchange (although you will be a little late to the party). Otherwise, there is a good article in the March 13, 2000 issue of The Industry Standard that will probably give you all the informaiton you need."
2,Below Average book,"It is an ok book for B2B introduction. That is all it is worthwhile reading. Also, some of these information are somewhat outdated. Financial market is very different than electronics market for example. Sure some of the market fundamentals are similar (such as liquidity, and transaction level....), but the nature of the underlying assets is very different. Get an used one or borrow from someone for a quick reading.... I bought it brand new while visiting Hong Kong.."
4,Wonderful orchestration,"I agree that this production is static. But the orchestraton is wonderful, if you like period instruments. It's worth getting for the orchestra alone...Savall and his players are terrific."
5,A Wonderful Production,This DVD is a wonderful production and highly recommended to those people who love early music and in particular the Savall family and orcchestra of talented musicians.
5,Showtime,"What a show! This thing called ""opera"" might just catch on if performers take this kind of attitude towards it. This DVD more than any other demonstrates the difference between ""historically informed"" and ""academician dictated"".Deflo's production is genius.Savall... what can you say. Brilliant musician, leader, scholar, and showman."
5,Fabulous Villain,"Well written, this book is easy to get caught up in. Sara William's strikes gold with her villain and gets inside his head. She points out how easily someone can be conned and how difficult it can be to seek justice."
4,"Interesting information, nice production",This is a nicely done DVD with an interesting segment on history and some well done segments spotlighting some of the most interesting places on the island. Photography and production are very professional. This one is definately worth the price for anyone interested in taking a trip to the Big Island.
1,Elvis fans will be disappointed! I know!,"This dvd contains the same information as Elvis - the missing years! If you want a better dvd with more information, buy that one. Very disappointing."
3,Rare footage for deep fans,"This DVD concentrates on perhaps Presley's least reported period - his Army years. There are several people here to reminisce about Elvis from 1958 to 1960, when he was stationed in Germany. Too bad that the names are not provided throughout the tape. The afficionado/historian might enjoy guessing who is being interviewed. I recognized the great Charlie Hodge, Elvis' close friend and musical mentor. His story about Elvis turning down the chance to crawl out the snow and visit the Vatican is very touching: Elvis was not about to abandon his fellow Servicemen.The musical soundtrack features an Elvis imitator."
5,Fabulously in Your Face,"Gretchen writes with a wonderful ""in your face style"" that I found refreshing. The title of the book is not only an author's ""Keyword Dream"" but the book answers the how to questions implied in each of those words. This is not fluff reading. If you are easily offended by the way the world really is out there, read another book. If you want to see life in the fast lane, here it is. This book is a winner. Kevin Hogan, ..."
1,Depressing,"If you think of all the good things a book can do and then turn them upside down, you have this book, which is a monument to the victory of vanity and trivial self-involvement over every worthwhile human value that a good book examines or celebrates. Maybe it will end up being a humorous testament to the excesses of our age. If that was its secret purpose, it succeeded, but that doesn't mean you should waste your time on it."
1,Egotism run amok,"It's hard to imagine a more cynical and manipulative book--it should be subtitled ""How to Become a Servant of your Worst Impulses"". How an author with such credentials could produce such dreck is amazing. Justice O'Connor, for whom the author clerked, must be crimson with shame. An extreme level of self-absorption and narcissism is needed to benefit from this ""wisdom and fun"". If you cheat on your spouse, lie to your friends, and want to be known as a grasping sleaze---then buy this book."
3,"disgusting ideas, but true","I'm still reading this book, but I find it totally disgusting in that it shows how phony and manipulative people can be. The descriptions of people in the ""power"" section I find nauseating. I'm too kind a person, I guess and don't like all the ""sloppy joes"" people put out trying to be so important. I am a person of power, but I didn't get it like that; even though I *do* see ways that--according to Rubin--I relinquished some of my power. I'll keep reading and comment again later, perhaps.I just like people to be straight up; cut all the mess. Be real."
1,"expert in academia, novitiate in tales of real people","There are very few Lisa Birnbachs, fewer still good anecdotalists,and virtually no readable satirists. Inappropriate displays of fragmentary erudition do not make a novelist-merely a candidate for more training in the art & craft of writing. This writer NEEDS an original or novel idea . Fragments picked from here and there can never make a page of writing--perhaps a vertiginous patchwork quilt which causes nausea, but never pleasure. Living in Washington is not the same for inspiration as La Place des Voges or chez une soiree of the Guermantes."
4,Machine Embroidery,"Purchased this when I was new to Machine Embriodery and it is a help. When you are new to embroidery, you need all the self-helpers that you can find. This was another good tool."
5,Great Sale,"I purchased this for some help with ideas and helpful instruction with some of my existing designs so that I can make items for the craft shows for next year. The bonus designs are great but were just that, a bonus. Most of what you buy really don't come with a lot of instruction and I have little time for chat rooms and forums. Great idea for me!"
3,Not impressed,I found that the roller ball is difficult to use. Also was not impressed with the instructions for downloading music and can only use ITunes. The Ipod is not as user friendly as I had hoped.
1,what was apple thinking?,"Well apple's marketing toads are at it again, this time to put another picture of it's precious ipod on Amazon's front page, the only problem is, its the same ol' ipod.The only difference is that the HP company has smeared its logo on the back. Thats all. If apple really wants to get the PC market, they need to add WMA support. I have 5,000 songs in WMA and theres no way I am going to degrade sound quality by converting to apples proprietary AAC.If apple were willing to allow WMA files on this player, perhaps I wouldn't have returned it."
1,HP Invent? Innovation?,"OK, so we all heard of HP's tag ""Invent"". And Carly Fiorina vouched for offshoring of US jobs as ""Freedom to Innovate"".So what's this? Freedom to copy?Please do not support HP."
2,"Broke after 11 months, hp initially claimed not to support",The hard drive on my ipod is predictably going after about 11 months. It won't boot.In my initial call to HP the representative said they did not support the product. It was just a branding thing. Then I went to the apple store and they said they didn't support. I called back HP at night and got an indian represenative that was very knowledgable and have found the support to be good since then. Apparently I got a bad person on the line.Hopefully HP will ship me a new one. Otherwise I like the IPOD quite a bit.
1,don't buy this ipod,i would rate this ipod a -5 since it is so bad. I bought 2 years ago and now my harddrive from the ipod crash. Now i don't have any more ipod. I went to the store and they won't give me another to replace since my warranty is up. Now i don't have an ipod and i waste my money from buying an ipod that doesn't work.
1,WORST PURCHASE OF MY LIFE,"The 40GB HP Ipod I purchased in February 2005 was my most disappointing purchase to date. With a sticker price ~ $400 you would expect the product to last longer than a year without the harddrive crashing completely.HP customer service said I could send in it to be repaired for $270 plus shipping, and that ""might work"".The HP factor was unknown to me at the time of purchase (ignorant, I know) but had I known I would not have purchased. I have friends who easily have their ipods troubleshooted/repaired/replaced in person at Apple stores (where they were purchased).I will never buy another HP product again.My advice: Go to an Apple Store, pay the extra $20 bucks, and receive a quality product and service."
1,DON'T Buy the HP iPod If You Have a Mac!,"I got the HP iPod as a gift, and even after three days of playing with it I still haven't figured out how to transfer songs from my iMac to the iPod. This one comes with instructions for Windows users, but not for those who have Macs. The Apple website has instructions for those with the regular Apple version of iPod, but nothing on what to do if you have this version and are trying to use it with a Mac. Additionally, Apple tech support won't help (because I have the HP version) and HP tech support won't help (because I have a Mac). Everything seems to agree that this iPod theoretically *should* work with my computer, but you're very much left to your own resources to figure out how to make it happen. Mac owners should save themselves the headache and avoid the HP iPod."
5,A wonderful addition to any Flash library!,I really enjoyed Hillman Curtis's insight and I think it is a great book! A must have for all Flash libraries!
1,I don't get it!,"Don't waste your time and money... buy the "" New Masters of Flash "" book.Better work, Better Ideas, More variance. As a designer I think very little of this book. As a Flash developer I think very little of this book.Spend your money elsewhere."
5,Finally a book that does not start off on how to draw topic,"I think this book is excellent, because it get right to the point on how to do animation. Not like other books how half of the book is dedicated in learning the drawing tools, and how only a small portion is dedicated in learning the animation part. Another thing I like about it is the easy step by step planning."
5,A book that belongs to a new wave that shines,"New Flash 4 books are starting to appear quickly, after the success of this product faced a scarcity of books and tutorials in the market. Different from the introductory and drawing-based nature of the other books, this book gets even better than ""Flash 4 Magic"" (the second best)."
2,Design over substance,"While it's nice to see a little design in Flash books finally, Flash Wed Design pulls the ol' trick of giving you so much glitz and glitter that you're fooled into thinking there's content in the book. To be fair, there was some decent info on Quicktime and 3D with Flash, but beyond that Flash Web Design is woefully behind the standard of books like Flash 4 Magic and Graphics, Animation, and Interactivity: with Flash 4.0 in all areas except design. The lack of a CD is devestating and is it just me or does someone have a serious ego trip going here (the motion blur employed on the author's mug on the cover is actually telling because most of the techniques within the book are brutally fuzzy at best). I'm puzzled at all the five star reviews. Either there's a lot of people who want a good looking coffee table book, or Curtis has a lot of friends pullin' for him. As for me, I can't recommend the book and I am ashamed of falling for the design over substance trick."
5,great book,"I didnt even know flash until I bought this book, now everybody thinks Im a hammer at flash! this book rocks..............loved it man"
5,Well layed out and easy to use,"This is the best flash book that i have ever seen. It accomplishes its task of explaining the methods needed to produce quality flash animation. The layout was phenominal as was the content of the book. I have yet to see any book which simplifies the production process of any computer based work, whether it be a straight coding guide or for other art related programs. Overall this is one of the most helpful resources that i have found to date."
3,The most expensive maganize i've ever bought,"Yes, the book itself is well designed, but most of the proyects treated are old and the new ones on the companion site you can't donwlod the source. END"
3,Not for those who can't afford EVERY Macromedia product,"I bought this book hoping that it would teach me some real neat tricks with flash design. The step-by-step was great, but after chapter 2 or 3, he started using programs that were way beyond my budget or my expertise. In order to really use this book, you have to know/own almost every Macromedia design product.I would deem this book worthy of those who have designed for many years and are looking for a broader design base, but not for those just learning or looking for ""cool effects."" This book will merely serve to confuse you.Good luck to all my designer comrades! I hope you'll find this book more approachable than I did!"
3,Errors in the book,"I'm not sure if there is a revised version of this book or not,but I ran into trouble starting with the shockwave chapter. Afterrereading the steps several times and then finally downloading theproject file itself website I found that there were errors in thebook. Because of the errors in the book, I don't recommend this forbeginners otherwise you will be spending several extra hours trying totroubleshoot your work."
2,Terrible layout / typography,This book might have useful information about using flash in web design but the layout and typography is so terrible that I can't really use it as a reference.
3,Flash Web Design,The concept of this book is good teach me the 20% that I will use 80% of the time. But for someone new this book was not tested. It should have been put down next to someone who has never worked with animation or maybe Macromedia products because steps are missing. I have encountered this in the first couple pages. If this book went through a rewrite and those steps taken care of it would be a great book. In short it did not live up to its potential.
3,good for a beginner,this book gives a lot of insight and good tips for someone just starting off with flash.
4,good book with a few flaws,"This book is a good one for novice or professionals - It gives good design tips and show ideas you may never have thought ofHowver - The biggest flaw of the book is in the projects - Each chapter has a project that it consists of to show the techniques - Each chapter uses certain video clips, or sounds, etc. - There is no CD with this book that contains these supporting materials so you actually can't follow along with each lesson and try it out since you dont have the required files and as far as I know there is no way to get them - The only chapter you can try out is the first one since it just works with animating text - The others, you just have to read and try to grasp concepts, ever though you can't try them out as you work throught the lessons.For $45.00 they could have at least included a CD with all project materials."
4,Good Book - No Supporting Material,For a $45usd $67cdn book they could have inc. a cd-rom with all the support material!
5,I loved this book,"This is a beautifully written and emotionally courageous story of a man and the way in which he circles endlessly towards and away from the woman of his life, Claire Marvel. The tension between these two characters has such weight, and builds with such suspense, that that I stayed up until almost two in the morning to find out how the book would end. A terrific read."
2,excellent writing except....,"This book had very poignant moments but overall the characters seemed just too idiotic to be believed. The main problem for me was that it wasn't obvious why Claire Marvel was so great, why she was worthy of unremitting love. She has a few witty remarks and is supposedly beautiful but what of it? Her acts are not justifiable and therefore you can't relate to her or to the protagnist. In the end I just wanted to knock both character's heads together because they acted so stupidly. I suppose their inability to commit to each other might be some underlying theme of the novel but it makes very frustrating reading!!!"
1,I Marvel that I Managed to Finish This Book,"Most of this book was pointless fluff. Why do we need to know every detail about the main character's teaching and his marriage and blah blah blah? The few chapters with Claire in the beginning were not enough to convince me of a great love -- and the reason for their (prolonged) seperation didn't convince me either, so nothing in-between held me. At many points I wondered what I was reading for. He seemed obsessed, she seemed morose -- I didn't care one way or the other by the end. And I'm a romantic!!!"
2,pretentious and silly,"I did not find this book believable -it read as if done by a high school student. The characters had no depth. I kept thinking abour Mistry's book ""A Fine Balance"" and how real and engrossing the story and characters were. Mr Schwartz should be praised for his fine effort -but this book was not for me -sorry!!"
4,A Brilliantly Readable Book,"If you've read anything about Love and Longing, this is the story that will make you sob. The last book I can remember to make me feel this vulnerable was Scott Spencer's ""Endless Love"" some 22 years ago. This book is just as beautiful and haunting as that. Oh, please, buy this book and read a rapturous story that will leave you gasping for air! I can't recommend it more highly!"
5,Claire Marvel--An Obsession,"I admit to some trepidation in picking up a book that is marketed as a love story. But I have to confess, that after I'd read 30 pages of Claire Marvel, I could not stop reading it. Despite having to juggle family and other obligations, I finished it in one weekend, although I savored the images and feelings for weeks afterwards. I was even tempted to read it again, immediately, something I never do. In short, I was obsessed with Claire Marvel. And I'm not the only one. My husband and most of my friends who have read it have become obsessed by Claire as well. This book really makes the reader feel love--in all of its glory, ambiguity and agony--in a way that no other book I have read before does. Put this book at the top of your list, but be warned that it may become an obsession."
3,Pretty good,"I thought this book was worth it for the feelings about young love and lost love. I enjoyed how the love experiences of the different family members brought varying perspectives to the main story line. BUT...the first part, the development of their relationship rang false and the writing was affected. The metaphors felt like lists from work, and the rhythm was very annoying. Also the main character was quite the wimp, and although he was young, the whole tormented young love thang felt like a Herman Hesse novel (I'm over that phase, thank you). The remaining two thirds of the book was good, but I don't recommend it unless you're into being melancholy and love-torn for the duration..."
3,Good for the Christian Qabbalist,"It's a good book for people interested in the Revelations and its qabbalistical meaning, the whole book comments it."
4,McBain is in his usual top form with this one.,"Ed McBain manages to fill the short space of two-hundred pages (exactly) with a normal 87th Precinct corpse, and the mystery that follows, plus two side stories-how Bert Kling is trying to hold on to his model wife, and how an ex-con psycho is out hunting for him. Try this, you won't be disappointed."
2,"Really bad, but entertaining","I'm ashamed to say that I enjoyed this book; it is actually quite entertaining, with a suspenseful storyline.Regrettably, it is so plagued with errors (typographical as well as historical) and it is so blatantly reactionary, that it ruins the story. Instead of being a good spy-thriller it ends up being nothing more than cheap right-wing propaganda.Pity!"
5,The power to recover,"This book is wonderful - honest, heart-breaking and triumphant, funny, reflective. Any one of us could experience the challenge of parents with sudden illness - and the dramatic and irreversible shift that causes in our relationships, sense of self, priorities, and plans for the future. Susan Edsall captures with sometimes painful honesty the hard path towards recovery - one that leaves you physically better but forever in a different place. Read this, and you'll be thankful she shared her story."
5,Laugh Out Loud!,"Someone you love suffers losses from a stroke that potentially changes them forevcer and you feel helpless! The doctors and professionals know what they are doing! RIGHT???? NO, sometimes the pit of your stomach is a far better guide. Two feisty sisters know no better than to bulldoze boldly forward in their attempt to recapture the father they know and love without contraints. This is a hilarious account of a very serious situation. It is a book you will not want to put down. It is a story of strength and most of all, unquestioning and unconditional love."
5,Great read!,"This was easily the best book I've read in a long time. The story kept me captivated, and I laughed and cried with her as Susan told her story. She does a great job telling of the struggle when her dad has a stroke. She also mixes it with stories from her childhood, and through it you begin to relate to her family and you see the growth she and her sister go through as they walk with their parents through this struggle. I also found it amazing that there was so little help for people who go through strokes, at least in her neck of the woods, although her husband reiterated it in his research, and they lived across the country from her parents. Pretty appalling, really. But the story wasn't centered around the care or lack thereof by the medical profession. It was about the walk she and her sister took with her dad. Great, great book. I received a copy from Librarything.com"
5,Lamp shade,This shade was absolutely perfect. Could not find this size in our local stores. I love the size and the color.
2,"Good At First, but.......","I actually listened to this book on tape (unabridged). The first three cassettes on how to do things right were hilarious! But, the remainder of the book was for the most part was a disappoinment. It had some funny and/or interesting bits, but the remaining was one rambling paragraph after another."
3,Retired man beats Fussy man,"Have you ever heard of Rust Hills? I had not until I came across this book. He has quite good literary credentials that are evident in the unhurried, readable style. The Fussy Man's essays are funny, especially the one about how to eat an ice cream cone. However, the retired man is much more interesting to me. For one thing, he's real. The author humorously and philosophically discusses being retired. How to banish the angst? Routines and pursuits. He compares Thoreau and Montaigne on leisure time. He is spot on about the retired life, both in his humor and personal solutions. BTW, this book is still on my currently reading shelf since it's one you can dip into, enjoy, and leave for a while."
3,Re-read recently,"I read this book again recently after finding a copy at the library. I still am not overly fond of this book, but I don't dislike it as much as I used to. A lot of Mr. Hill's oppinions on life in general are very witty and reasonably funny. However, I still think that he dwells to much on the (un-funny) day-to-day routines of his life. Perhaps if he had sped things along a little I could have given his book four stars instead of three."
2,Rambling old man,"This guy really knows how to put people to sleep. I attempted to read this book on a flight from Dallas to Cincinatti. Thirty minutes after take-off (and when I began reading) I was fast asleep. As I never can sleep on planes, this can give you some idea how dull this book is. The first chapters were sort of funny, but the latter half seemed to be just a reproduction of his Day Runner (""6 pm January 17. Drool on self "") I think it could have been far better if the author had stuck to the actual title of the book (namely- How to do things right) instead of Ramblings of an old man."
4,Great photo illustrations and easy to understand text!!,"As a novice puppet maker, I think the book is very good for all ages. I teach secondary art and introduced the book to the students by leaving it on the front desk. Students could brouse through it on their own. Bad news/good news: someone stoled it--that's the bad news. The good news is it is good enough to steal!!! I recommend it!"
5,"so touching, so moving, so beautiful...","i was incredibly moved and touched by this movie. and even somewhat tearful at the end. not in sorrow, but in the fact of being reached down to my soul by this animated work of art. the illusionist and his relationship with the girl is a piece of poetry that is highlighted by the artwork and the pacing of the film. it moves along exactly as it should, so that you are drawn into the adventure and begin to believe in magic. in the magic of believing. i loved this film and wished that it had received a broader audience so that more people could have the wonderful experience and joy of seeing such a beautiful work of art."
4,Not your average bag of animated tricks...,"the Illusionist perfectly enables the audience to experience realism at the first hand of an animated presentation. This works as both a good thing and a bad thing: Good, because of the moral lessons it evokes as well as its ability to translate. Bad, the end can't always be as happy go lucky as one would hope. The Illusionist is a beautiful film with wonderfully crafted--if albeit, quiet--characters that are more than likely to make you shed a tear or two. This film is nothing short of magical."
1,"No special features for DVD, despite product claims!","Here's the deal. Yes, the film is wonderful, and is the last lovely Tati script. The animation is brilliant, etc.BUT ARE YOU KIDDING ME, SONY PICTURES CLASSICS? Does it mention anywhere on the package that the special features are NOT included with the DVD? No. It does not mention that. So...A) You force us to get the movie in the wretched Blu-ray case even though most of us have absolutely NO NEED for the Blu-ray disc, because we didn't buy this ridiculous, pointless technology in the first place.B) You mislead us by NOT stating on the package that the special features are NOT included on the DVD, because you think this will compel me to go out and buy a stinking Blu-ray player.I'm sick of corporations treating consumers like garbage. ONE STAR for a great film used as an excuse to rip people off, thanks to the greed of Sony Pictures Classics."
1,JUST AWFUL !!!,"I was so looking forward to seeing this vidoe. I had purchased it on amazon instant video a few weeks ago during a weekend sale- $1.99As soon as the video started it was boring, too, too, too slow. Had no charm. Nothing- just wasted viewing time. I am so glad I didn't see it in the movies- i would have demanded my money back. Gail S."
3,I don't know . . .,"I knew this was a French movie, and I don't mind subtitles and foreign films, but I was a little annoyed when the subtitles said ""speaking a foreign language"" or ""speaking in French"". Well duh! The only words that were translated in subtitles were the English ones. I don't get it. Isn't that what the subtitles are there for? So you know what they're saying in the ""foreign language""?I'm also not very happy that I had to buy the Blu-ray to get the DVD. At least offer them separately to give you the option, but making you buy something you don't want to get the thing that you do want is a rip-off. The movie is reasonably sweet, but the other stuff kind of ruined it for me and makes me wish I hadn't wasted the money."
4,The animators magically capture the essence of Tati,"A beautifully made movie with considerable charm about an itinerant magician and the gold digger who insinuates herself into his life - until she finds a young hunk to replace him. The Illusionist, disillusioned, abandons everyone who depends on him to proceed through life alone. The style of the hand drawn animation is perfect for adapting the Jaques Tati story and the animators magically capture the essence of Tati in the title character."
4,"Unusual, Poignant and Endearing","This is an animated Euro-style movie with very little dialog, not that it needs it! Complicated issues and feelings are expressed well regardless. The artwork is well done, and the scenery absolutely pastoral. Although I did find it somewhat slow moving, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.This is not your childhood animation, it's strictly for adults as kids will find it confusing with adult themes.In essence, it's about an aging Illusionist in the late sixties Europe who has made a living travelling from one small venue to another, never developing close relationships with exception of other performers. When he is ""befriended"" by an unsophisticated teen-aged girl, his life (and that of his obstinate bunny) is changed... in a good way for the bunny, but not for him.I did find myself fast forwarding through some of the uncomfortable moments while he's trying to fit into a mold that's just not him, all for the well-being of the girl."
5,Great for Gifts,"This is my second book in this series. I was given a box of canning jars and with this book, I can layer the dry ingredients in the jar, top the jar with a cute little ""hat"" made from scraps of material or paper, attach the recipe card and tie with a ribbon or twine. Give this to anyone who likes to bake. All they have to do is pour what's in the jar into a bowl, add the wet ingredients like eggs and vanilla, follow the recipe/instructions on the card to bake. They make really nice little gifts."
2,"ok, but messy","The size was ok--I ordered one size up after reading other reviews that said it ran small, my daughter is a 18-24mos./2T now, I ordered a 3T. (my daugher has longer legs)The fabric is thin and the pink feathers come off everywhere! The tail fell off and the elastic for the headband fell off after 2 uses also. I just stitched them back on and then they were OK.Overall, the costume is OK for limited use and is cute, but feathers are messy."
2,Pointless book,"I hated this class so I hated this book. College Writing 1 is pointless. I already knew everything I ""learned"" in that class."
1,I NEVER GOT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,YOU GUYS SUCK! I NEVER GOT THIS BOOK AND HAVE A PAPER DUE SUNDAY NIGHT! I BORROWED A COPY FROM A FRIEND AND WROTE 18 PAGES WORTH OF NOTES SO THAT I WOULD HAVE THE MATERIAL I NEEDED TO ATTEMPT TO WRITE THIS PAPER!!!!!!!!!!! YOU GUYS SUCK! THE POST OFFICE HAD TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION TO FIGURE OUT WHY I NEVER GOT THE BOOK AND WHERE IT IS. THANKS ALOT.
2,Way too tough.,"At first, we thought this would be an exciting game as my friends and I all have a good background of sports and we all watch ESPN semi-frequently to frequently.. So we were all confident that we would have a good chance at getting a lot of correct answers. But, all of us were probably clueless on 95% of the questions posed by the game. It was simply ridiculous and turned out to be not fun at all, I mean the only way we could win was by rolling high numbers on the dice or getting team logo questions.It was very disappointing for all of us, even my friend who we all thought was a genius with sports struggled to even get an answer right. We all left the game shocked at how difficult and not fun this game was, and to be successful you probably would have to watch sports and sports history literally all day long to enjoy this.Not recommended to any group of people whether sports fanatic or not.."
4,fun for sports fans,This is a good game for sports fans and the party mode is really good as well. Very good replay value.
5,Where's season two?,"Okay, there's several other reviews out there. They basically say ""great show, very cynical, very funny."" I agree whole heartedly. Loved it. Bought the boxed set immediately when I saw it. Low on extras but still fun. Now where's season two? I'm still waiting."
4,good pick,great to see this season all over again. just like live tv all over again. I would buy it again if I had to.
5,This Series Was Great!!,"I was so excited to get this at the way low price. 3 discs, my husband loves Ned, wish I could find Season 2. Highly recommend, my daughter thinks its a laugh as well, family friendly!!"
4,Not Will and Grace,"This DVD set is not Will and Grace, it's better. Too bad audiences didn't catch on quick enough, it could have been a classic. One of the best canceled tv shows."
5,Bargain.. and great show,I got this for a dollar at the dollar tree. I started to get at Burlington Coat Factory for 10 dollars. I saved 9 bucks by waiting. And I love this show. Its fun and funny.
4,"An engaging read, the commonplace made almost sacred","Browning's journeys through the world of apples are exhaustive, lyric and compelling. If you like NPR, or the old New Yorker, you'll love this book on the fruit of English Yeoman, Thomas Jefferson, French Nobelmen and Johnny Appleseed. You will never look at a grocery store Red Delicious the same again."
3,Interesting content - needs editing,"Interesting material, but I found myself been flipping forward in many of the early chapters because the content is so poorly edited. A couple of examples: the mythological anecdotes come across as a stream of connect-the-dots and I'm not sure what the takeaway was supposed to be. And when the segue from the power of genetic engineering to the tragedies of biotech is a half chapter on a Japanese researcher who killed himself because a US researcher figured out that there was Fire Blight in Japan, the linkage is just confusing, and the point of the first half of the chapter is mostly lost.The second half of the book is stronger, when Browning returns to the modern US apple industry that he participates in, and his own efforts to develop a cider business. If you are looking for a patchwork quilt of apple-related essays, some strong, some not, here it is."
5,so satisfying,"Such a good read! I give this book to friends all the time, even in 2011. Comparable to John McPhee."
5,Core Collection in Nursing.,"Selected by Brandon & Hill (Nursing Outlook, March-April, 1996) as one of best books for small nursing and medical libraries."
1,:(,"I kept waiting for the story to pick up. when it finally picked up it was over. I have read books in a series before but each book had enough story in itself to be satisfying. Sadly, I felt reading this book was not time well spent."
4,she IS the preacher's daughter,"This book is good, but doesn't capture your attention that well. Not many people can relate to this book because it revolves around the Amish world, not the modern, American world. It still stands, in my opinion, with the reputation as a sweet story. It isn't my favorite, but I enjoyed reading it, and it didn't bore me. It was enjoyable. If you crave action, though, or modern stories, don't bother to buy it. You'll be bored. Although, if you like anything and will enjoy everything, or if your attention thrives in a sweet, well written novel-like-book, you won't be wasting your time."
1,Grade School,A sweet and simple chapter book of a grade school level of reading comprehension. A waste of time to read for anyone over the age of 14.
5,Another Lews hit,"Intriguing and another Beverly Lewis book that I have become engrossed in. I believe this is 1 of 3 and I am currently on #2, so looking forward to finishing this series."
3,eh,It's not my favorite. It still has a decent plot nd ok characters. This makes me wonder if Lewis was desperate at the time.
1,Not an accurate portrayal of the Christian Faith,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is not genuine Christian fiction. I read the Preacher's Daughter and The Englisher and I found them to not be an accurate view of the Christian faith. The books (and the Amish faith) portray a legalistic religion, put their authority as supreme rather than a direct relationship with God, and don't allow people to say they have been saved through a personal relationship with God. This thinking is contrary to what the Bible teaches. The Preacher's Daughter also leaves you hanging. There is no good closure to the book and it does not stand alone as a book. You have to read the next book to continue the story and it doesn't conclude well either. I would not want people to buy these books thinking this is what it is to be a Christian. A relationship with God is personal and brings freedom not legalism."
4,A good read,"I have read several Beverly Lewis books in the past and have found some more enjoyable than others. This one I particularly enjoyed mostly because of the title character. Annie is an amish girl and intends to remain one, except for the fact that she is an artist at heart and cannot deny her longing for self expression. That self expression is strictly forbidden by her church district. Annie continues to paint secretly. When a well meaning friend enters her in an art contest, and she wins she truly forced to choose between her art and her people.I liked Annie, her character is developed and not overly simplistic as too many christian novel characters can be.What I do find frustrating is that book only stops not really ending, you have to read the following two books in order to discover what the tragic history that is hinted at is and how that effects Annie."
3,extremely upsetting,"At least in this series, so far, the young women are not in tears every time they turn around. That was so tiresome in another series by the same author. This lifestyle look at one Amish district made me so mad that it was hard to contain myself. Since the author grew up in an Amish setting, I am supposing that she knows what she is talking about. What was portrayed in this story should be against the law. How could any intelligent person follow this type of theology?! The hint of a mystery intrigued me and yes, I will definitely continue the series, hoping that the young woman with the artist abilities comes to her senses and escapes the tyrannic rules of her (?godly?-I DON'T THINK SO!) father! This book portrays a perfect example of a male control freak playing the role of God with his family."
5,Great book,"This is the first book in a series of 3. It takes you on a journey inside amish country and follows a young amih girl and her longtome penpal from the ""outside world"" when they finally get to meet face to face. There is a mystery of a yopung boy who went missing and a budding romance I am on the second book of the series and don't want to give away too much but it is a really good book and I highly recommend it!!!"
1,Written on Napkins,"This is a very disappointing work. Even given the paucity of biographical data on Catullus, a good ""life and times"" work could have been written about this poet at the nexus of some of the most intense political and sexual intrigue ever.This is not that book. It reads like it was written one paragraph a day: it's repetitive, meandering, unstructured, and riddled with generalities, unsubstantiated ""everybody knows"" opinions in lieu of scholarship and a few outright whoppers of historical errors.I've never gone to the trouble of posting a bad review before, but this book is so dreadful that I feel obligated to post a warning to others.The author's approach to the sexuality at the heart of Catullus's work is equally muddled, occasionally viewing sexuality from the Roman perspective but often veering off into the perjorative language of a bookish, sexist erotophobia."
2,Elusive Catullus,"Given how little we know about Catullus, it is amazing that Burl has yet managed to produce a book-length study about the famous Roman poet. More the fool I for purchasing the book and expecting to find out something, anything new about Catullus. What I found instead was a hodgepodge of well-established facts and well-known gossip about virtually anyone who may have known or been influenced by Catullus. There's little new here, and Burl's undistinguished style does nothing to redeem that little. Not even the translations are new, having been first published in 1985."
5,A Very Well Written Book,"I have never heard of the poet Catullus before coming across this book. It is well written and quite interesting, unlike many scholarly works that are as dry as burnt toast! The previous reviewer must have been expecting a book on poetry! Sorry! But this is a book on ancient history, with poet Catullus as the focal point!The bottom line: Ancient Rome was an incredibly violent place, run by many unscrupulous and depraved individuals. Never ending murder, assassination and incredible brutality were the norm. It's a pleasure to learn that least one individual, the poet Catullus, could rise above the unending fray!"
3,Alright,"It Was pretty good becuase i just wanted the Blue Eyes, the pack wasnt all that i got no rare cards, the best card was the Attack Of Dark Magician"
3,I can say right away that this is a shaky deal.,"Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon IS NOT a good card for tournaments because it takesa lot of effort to get out and it has no effect. But, if you want it as a collectors item, go for it if you must. Though the comic book won't appeal much to some duelists."
1,BLOODY BAD MOVIE,"This is like watching a home movie made by a couple of guys who meet in a bar and throw their 200 dollars together and make what is supposed to be a movie. Yuck! Repulsive. Redundant. Horrible performances, script and direction. You can tell from the opening you're in for a trash ride. Not even a great ""B"" movie. This movie as the vampires would say sux!!!"
3,"Really bad, but hilarious","I only rented this movie to laugh at how bad I knew it was going to be. And yes, it was very bad, but I was laughing throughout the whole thing. The movie was about a group of dwarf vampires who attack the ankles. As they say in the movie, they're ""3 feet tall with 2 inch fangs and an undying thirst for blood."" Haha. Only see this if you want to laugh at a corny, low-budget film and not for serious purposes."
1,"three feet of crap, 2 hours wasted","This movie isn't worth the time it takes to watch it, and I LIKE crappy movies like this. It's all a rip-off of Blade, with a couple of midgets. Unwatchable even with beer, I only give any stars because you have to applaud the fact that they actualy got the thing made."
3,HILARIOUSLY BAD!,"""it'll either kill him, or make him a helluva lot stronger...""My favorite line! Ha, if you enjoy mocking bad movies, this will give you plenty of material-- i won a 'Bad Movie Contest' with this one."
1,It doesn't get much worse,"Low budget homemade movie about vampire midgets who go around attacking people......IT'S AWFUL!! There's minimal action, poor acting, crap for a plot, and the cinematography sucks. I wish people would STOP making their own movies with camcorders!"
1,Oh wow....,"This is the most amazingly horrible film ever made. I've decided it might be worth buying to use as a practical joke on people, or better yet, show it to some unsuspecting person, get a group together, and take bets on how long before they stop watching it. I think I may have lasted 15 minutes myself, but I felt my brain melting so I stopped. However, if you ever get the chance to watch this movie, do it. Even if you cannot last more than 15 minutes, it's an experience you will never forget. There is no movie that will not seem better by comparison. I only gave it one star because 0 (or less than 0) was not an option."
3,Bring It On,The first one was really good and the second fair. I enjoyed watching the cheerleader acrobatics and are not abd stories. I just wish they would use the same actors/acresses in sequels.
4,Very well targeted,"I suspect regarding some of the negative (1 star) reviews this book has received a bit of guerrilla marketing.This is an excellent text on the subject and easy to read. It is far less confusing than most texts on the subject and makes a perfect text for upper undergraduate or graduate level geochem classes. It's a shame it is out of print at the moment. For presenting geochem in an understandable light, it is far Superior to some of the more popular texts.It is unfortunate that acceptable texts in this subject for the advanced undergraduate or graduate have become so hard to find. If Drever comes back into print, I would recommend giving it a good look.BTW, this is not a ""do it yourself"" book as some may surmise, it is a text that, while easy to understand, is best with a professor/staff/faculty member as a guide."
5,Valuable Reference for Aqueous Geochemistry Concepts,"Drever's has long been a valuable reference in my own work and in the classes I teach. It is one of several references I use for understanding geochemical processes. The first sentence of the preface states that the text is intended for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses. I first used this text when I took Aqueous Geochem in grad school and it really made a difference in understanding applications. Spend an hour with Stumm and Morgan and then look at Drever. You'll almost see the lightbulb go on over your head. The example calculations are great and the addition of the geochemical models enhance the applicability of the text.However, I would note that if you need to start with introductory chemical concepts this isn't the book for you.If you are weak in chemistry start elsewhere.Still... two thumbs up from this reviewer."
1,This book overcomplicates even the simplest of topics.,This book fails to explain topics in a manner suitable for beginners in this field. I recomend choosing any other book over this one.
3,"A Gemmell work, but not his greatest...","Having read almost all of his most recent work, I turned to this novel for my Gemmell pleasure.Unfortunately, Gemmell's usual flair and style for narration is scattershot in this piece and the cast of characters hold no real special appeal for me.While there are good ideas in this book, there is a much better read in any of his other novels."
3,A master of the English cozy,"This turned out to be a fairly compelling mystery, after a slow beginning. I did have trouble tracking the many peripheral characters, even with their odd names and quirky attributes, but the obsessive passions of the protagonist, Ellie Haskell, drive this amusing mystery about a murdering club whose purpose is to create widows. By the second half of the book, the question of who the founder and leader of the widow's club was, distracted me from the character confusion and in the last third, the climax was compelling enough to remind me of what I like about Dorothy Cannell. While not my favorite of her books, she remains, for me, a master of the English cozy."
4,EXCELLENT & INTRIGUING IDEAS!,"The Widow's Club itself is a very interesting and unique plot idea. The most interesting part of the book was learning about how the Widow's Club worked, the exact arrangements, etc. The rest of the book was fairly slow and I found myself skimming and just plain skipping a lot of it that was repetitive. I hated the frequenty Ellie whining about ""what if Ben finds out"" -- when it comes to Ben she is so wimpy and illogical and it is plain boring and disappointing to read those parts."
2,Blah,"At first, the book's premise is interesting: women banding together to do in errant spouses. However, it quickly becomes boring as the plot seems to meander and the same type of wit is used over and over. The characters are too one-dimensional to be of much interest."
2,Indigestible prose mars plot,"I found the prose style of this book to be disjointed, jumpy, and choppy. It is definitely not the clean, clear, direct, stick-to-business prose of say, Agatha Christie. The writing is not smooth. The ""plot"" or story line seems to get lost at times; it becomes rambling, episodic, and seemingly endless. At times, it reads like a ""bodice ripper"" instead of a mystery. It is told in the first person by Ellie Haskell, interrupted by occasional comments from the Tramwell sisters. But would Ellie really tell her most personal and intimate thoughts to the Tramwells--complete strangers? I think not"
4,"It's Korngold, but it's also Hello Dolly","This is a dark production, and one in which many viewers will find cause to quibble (that ever present dolly clutched by our troubled hero). It is also a well sung and recorded performance that is quite moving at times. Until something better comes along, this will do nicely."
3,"Good singing, beautiful music, odd production","The production designer seemed to think the primary focus should be on his talents rather than the actors or composer. Angela Denoke was wonderful, Toesten Kerl efective as the ill fated hero. They had to do battle with the sets and costumes. It was difficult to understand Korngold's opera because of the poor production."
3,"Singing 5 stars, Production 2 stars","Korngold is an over the top composer, but this production tries to out do him, and as a result, is confusing. Denoke is wonderful, physically beautiful with a matching voice. Kerl is fine and convincing. They have a hard time competing with the ""everything but the kitchen sink"" production. The designers seem to feel the focus of the opera should be on the sets and peculiar design decisions rather than on the music and Korngold's conception for the opera."
2,"Great DTS sound and singers, poor stage production",Turn off the video and listen to the top quality DTS sound and musicians perform Korngold's best opera. The stage production would have turned Korngold over in his grave. It is so distracting from the music it is a useless part of the DVD.
4,Die Tote Stadt at last,"At long last we have a video of this neglected masterpiece. The production could be better, but for Europe at this time it is fine. The work contains a haunting aria, ""Gluck, das mir verlieb,"" which will stay with you forever. Puccini saw it in Vienna a few years before his death and said it was great. I agree with Puccini. Korngold, of course, wrote memorable movie music - Robin Hood, Captain Blood, Sea Hawk, King's Row, and others. The heldentenor should lose a few pounds, so he can move around the stage better."
3,jokes,"My young grandson will probably like these jokes, however, I would have preferred them to be random jokes not alphabetical names. I hope he ""gets"" the jokes."
5,funny book,Got this for a grandson who was always asking me for a knock- knock joke and this way we can look up new ones that he can repeat to his friends at school.
4,Man Alive,Stephen Stills has always been one of the premier rock stars ever. Man Alive is clearly one of his better works todate. He teams up with some old friends including Neil Young and the results are superb. An excellent album from a great guitarist and singer.
4,"Best Stills effort since ""Manassas""","This is the best effort by Stephen Stills since ""Manassas"". There is a great blend of acoustic based folk (Hearts Gate), Blues (Wounded World), Cajun (Acadienne), Caribbean (Feed the People), and nice rockers such 'Round the Bend' with old pal Neil Young lending a hand on guitar. It's also good to hear CSNstalwart Graham Nash lending some song writing assistance and background harmony.Stills was sounding sort of contrived and desultory on the previous CSNY outings (""American Dream"" and ""Looking Forward""), but he's now got a second wind from somewhere. The quality of the songs on this cd are right up there with ""Suite Judy Blue Eyes"", ""Carry On"", ""It Doesn't Matter"", ""So Begins the Task"", etc. Overall this is a quality cd of good song writing and execution by a lengendary singer/song writer and guitarist."
5,Keep walking the trail,"Man Alive""show us Stephen Stills as always .Excelente musician, composer and interpreter and over all the consistent of a ""trail"" that counstancily he walks.If the next compact disc to delay more 14 years we hope at that time we are livings creature to receive it."
2,Forgetable,"This is a forgetable album that diehard Stephen Stills fans should pass on. The man was an icon in his day but peaked 30+ years ago. Stills has clearly lost his once beautiful voice. He alternately sounds like a drunk or a retard. The backing vocals are horrid. A couple of the more up tempo tunes are mildly interesting and the increased volume serves to disguise somewhat the key weakness of the entire effort - Mr. Still's voice. And the guitar playing is still up to snuff. But, oh yeah, in case I didn't mention it. He sounds really BAD. It's a real shame."
5,AWESOME!!!!,Excellent CD! Roby Deaton never disappoints you with his perfect fusion of drama and soothing sensuality. A must for your collection!!
1,Very Misleading,I was under the impression that this was the Valerie Bartinelli dvd since it is list along with this dvd. There is no image available so you feel you're getting the Judith Krantz dvd at a lower price. I will be returning and will never purchase another item which does not contain the image.
4,"I Love You Honey, But the Season's Over","Readable, fragile, but all the memories of reading this when I was a young girl came back. It's amazing that Amazon had the means to get this book back to me."
5,For Youth and Adults,"Quality Concealed is a novel for both youth and adults readers. Betty Briggs weaves a great story between all the characters. She had me despising some characters in the beginning, but liking and understanding them in the end. The reader struggles along with Heather as she tries to train her horse and through her trials with the cute David. The fights between Heather and Sheila are common between teen girls, allowing the youth readers to connect with the characters. The Heather series is a good addition to any home library."
4,Early Years Basketball Set,"A colorful play set for the young sports stars. The soft colorful ""balls"" in the shapes of animals create interest in the toy and a learning opportunity for the child. If the balls don't go in the basket, they are soft enough to play ""catch"" with. Love the set!"
2,Earlyyears baby basketball,"The container is a bit too shallow. If it could be deeper or has an opening, that will make the throwing more fun."
3,Pricey for what it is but kind of fun,"I bought this toy because my daughter love to throw things, and I figure it will be nice for her to learn to throw in something, to learn how to aim.This toy fill this purpose, but I think it's pricey for what it is, and I could build a similar toy by myself with a bucket and soft ball."
4,Good toy,I love that my daughter can play with this now and it will grow with her. She is too little to understand basketball but loves to play with all the animal toys.
1,Poor quality,This toy is designed to self store. It is difficult if not impossible to get the hoop back to a round shape. Unable to use the toy as designed.
4,Very energetic and fun - NOT low impact,"The music is great and the dance moves are fun. Just know this is not a low-impact workout. They even do close ups of their feet moving so you can learn the moves (unlike many other workout videos). I wish she didn't say, ""Right here,"" every other sentence. That gets annoying. The workout is fun."
3,Unexpected Fun,As a rank beginner to Bhangra and not being particularly adept at dance this was a challenge. Definitely fun and will get you moving and count as a workout. If you love the music as I do it is worth it for the joy of listening and dancing as you try to learn. I found it invigorating and enjoyed trying something so different from the usual exercise routines. If you are looking for a routine to nail down and follow flawlessly this is not for the inexperienced!
3,There is potential,"It is a good workout, but as someone who has been doing aerobics like this for years, I wasn't able to follow very well as she takes no time to actually show you steps, she just does them. Usually this isn't really a problem, but there are some moves involving the hips and arms that need to be shown from more angles or just, you know, explained.It still is a great workout and I do recommend it, just don't expect to be able to show off moves after watching it once."
3,not what i expected,well im sure some people who wrote good reviews might think different from me but i thought i was going to have fun with this dvd but it doesn't help u step by step. usually thats more easier for me but this one doesnt ever stop. i guess it can be considered a good cardio cuz it always keeps u moving which is good but i want to perfect the steps better but sumtymes i cant catch up and it will do sum of the same steps again but its always fast paced. for people who can catch on there will probabaly be fine. but i was expecting better and it being more fun.
4,Great energy,"I am new to the Bollywood style of dances. I was looking for something different, that would be motivating and get me up and moving. I actually found this originally on exercisetv.com and liked it so much I decided to buy my own copy via Amazon. The energy is amazing and the dance/exercise segment looks like they are having so much fun. Sarina Jain, the instructor is loud and fun and really draws you in. My daughter and I have been dancing with the DVD for a couple weeks now and it's great."
3,Great work out,Great work out DVD. It is easy to use but at times goes too quickly with no close up shots of the new step. Watching it again solves this problem but be prepared to learn 5-7 steps in a half hour session. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants to learn bhangra dance but cannot join a formal class.
4,"worth the effort, esp. for the long run","i purchased this dvd awhile ago & at first i was intimadated by it because there were soo many moves but i realized i had to lose myself in order to learn them, soo i could fully experience this workout. however, truth be told, this is not the type of workout to tone muscles but it's gr8 for people with heart problems."
3,Battery worked as expected,It is a Battery. Plug it in and it charges. This one charged. We are happy with the purchase of this battery.
5,Beautiful Yarn!,This yarn lives up to its name ... Wool-Ease => Easy Care and easy to work with on the needles; Thick => This Yarn is SUPER thick; Quick => Really depends what you're knitting ... I am knitting a HUGE blanket so the project won't be quick ... but the blanket is turning out wonderful ... the Yarn is beautiful!
3,"hey dickie (RIP), how about some new songs?","i love blue cheer and am fanatical about their releases. these are good recordings and i do recommend it with reservations. they seem to fall in the same trap that the groundhogs have done, in that the live material has generally, the same songs on it. i disagree with some of the reviewers that insist that these are all that much more different or that much better than the previous live releases. overall, they are basically the same. being live, of course they are a little different in performance, spirited play or whatever. but nevertheless, the song remains the same. hopefully there will be more live releases with different songs and even better yet, a new studio album. love these guys! sad to say dickie passed away in october of '09. his music will live on......"
3,Good album but done before,I've always loved Blue Cheer. Much maligned at the time they were true pioneers. If you want a live Blue Cheer album and don't have any of their other live ones this is as good as any of them. The only problem is all the live albums have basically the same songs. Most classic bands fall into that same trap both on live & studio albums. Buy this if you don't have any live Blue Cheer but if you do consider the new album What Doesn't Kill You. It's killer all the way through and is also probably their best sounding album ever.
5,Teddy Stole The Show,"This is the best movie yet that Teddy has acted in. His onscreen persona is simply amazing and beautiful. His lasting impression in this movie is going to be remembered by many people by the way he falls. As an early Teddy fan, I can say that this movie is a must have in everybody's collection."
4,The Book of Secrets of Albertus Magnus,"etta var bókin, sem ég arfnaist og var allt í lagi. a var mjög gott a fá essa bók á enskuj.KvejaEinar G. Pétursson"
3,Powerhouse of Occult Knowledge!! (snicker),"This is a fun little book. 5 1/2 x 8 inches, 128 pages (nearly half of which is commentary).Somewhat of a ""Poor Richard's Almanac"" of its time (published sporadically in one form or another for hundreds of years), only part of which can be attributed to Uncle Albert. It has apparently been edited substantially from its original Latin form, leaving out all the salacious bits for the prudent Western audience.It contains wondrous descriptions of the magical properties of stones, plants, and animals. Most of these descriptions are incomplete, or at least don't actually describe what their headings advertise. But most of the information was probably lost in translation or just plain edited out anyway, so just pretend that when something is missing or the text just doesn't make any sense that it is some arcane alchemical allegory.All in all, a fun read and a little history lesson from reading the commentary."
1,Soapy coffee,"Ultra concentrated, that's right. This stuff is almost impossible to use. It's so concentrated it's difficult to dilute and to rinse off your dishes. Which means soapy coffee. Ruined meals because your pans still had soap in them. Yuck.I even tried using a measuring spoon to get the right amount of soap in the water. When I finally got the amount that rinsed clean there was no longer enough soap in the water to get the dishes clean. I switched back to the old Dawn. To my surprise when I did that my pets mystery vomiting stopped.Too difficult to use in my opinion."
5,Best WWE DVD yet,"This is the best WWE DVD. My biggest complaint about the recent WWE DVD's is the total lack of extras (matches leading up to PPV, Raw episodes of impact to the PPV, etc). This DVD has everything and then some. From seeing Kurt Angle doing real amateur wrestling moves at the olympic practice facility, DX invades WCW, to the Classic Vince/Shawn screws Bret storyline in Montreal (match included). DVD contains classic footage of Jimmy Snuka. Nuff said."
5,I'm ready for the holiday's!,This vinyl is an absolute gem. It worked perfectly and has such a rich sound to it. These songs are some of Elvis' best for the holiday season. They pick up and get energetic and then slow down a bit later on. Overall I'm just really happy to have purchased this item.
5,Beautiful,"My husband wanted the anchor; he felt it visually reveals who Jesus is to him, an anchor of his life and soul. The anchor is beautifully made and just the right size, not to large or small."
5,Magnificent!,This is one of the most amazing books ever! Truly a miracle -- the entire gamut of personal and global transformation in practical terms. Beautifully written. Simply brilliant!
4,"Fluff My Pillow , Bend My Straw:The Evolution and Undoing of a Nurse",As pertinent today as the day published. Only the names change in the sick care industry and that does not protect the innocent.A sick industry which has created a sicker industry with the nurse as the go between. An enlightening read which should be required reading for all providers and consumers of sick care.
4,Good for what I need.,I wanted a thin mouse to pack with my dell mini 9 in it's thin sleeve. Everything on the mouse works fine. Wish there were more buttons and the shape isn't the greatest for long time use (flat instead of rounded) but it's a lot better than trying to use the mini touchpads on laptops. Got it for 25 at cc and that was a low enough price for me to bite.
3,Presenter Mode Only,"I'm looking for a presentation mouse that will allow me to move the mouse around the screen, like a gyro mouse. This mouse doesn't do that. It does allow you to switch to presentation mode and click through pages of a powerpoint presentation for instance. I had to look in the product manual on the Kensington website to find that out. Otherwise it appears to have great features."
2,Looks good but scroll wheel is too stiff,"Mouse looks good, and is a slim enougth to slide into a pocket in your laptop bag. The USB transceiver is tiny and hides well inside the moise body when stowed. But, the scroll wheel is shiny and stiff to turn. The only way I can turn the wheel is to lick your finger, like you were counting money. Too bad. There is no thumb back button, but I can live without that. The entire mouse is high gloss, so it can be difficult to grip with dry hands. I am still searching for the perfect mouse."
3,Good collection of photos but short on text,"For the real Captain Fantastic fan of Elton this book may be a disappointment. It's full of great photos, many I have not seen in other sources, however it lacks real insight & detailed info on our Elton. It gives you breif overviews on what he has done, and unfortunately starts to repeat itself at times! (maybe padding information!?) I would recommend this book for the lucky folks who are just discovering the magic of Elton. However there are many good books on this incredible musician & caring human being. Luckily AMAZON has a lot of them!"
1,TERRIBLE!,"This movie SUX! Martin Lawerence isn't funny at all, all he does is make vulgar jokes and shout profanity constantly! The movie has no funny parts at all and pushes the PG-13 rating to it's limits. It stinks, don't rent or buy this movie!"
1,Pathetic,"Is it just me, or has Nelly lost every ounce of credibility he once possessed? Teaming up with pop-star Christina Aguilera wasn't such a good idea either, it didn't work when Nelly worked with N'SYNC, and it doesn't work here either. This is just another watered-down made-for-the-radio song featuring two hitmakers, but that doesn't really mean anything. Nelly doesn't even think about rapping here either, you can hear him crying ""SHE'S RIGHT YA KNOW, SHE'S RIGHT"" in his annoying high-pitched voice, also displaying his feeble lyrical abilities as well. Nelly is becoming a shadow of his former self, which wasn't even very much to begin with."
3,Smells really good but....,This lotion smells really good but my wife seemed to have some type if allergic reaction to it. Too bad because she liked it otherwise.
5,Lerahk,This is another great figure from the no longer running bionicle line of figures. This figure looks really cool and is very durable. I purchased this figure for $20 and it is worth it this figures box can be used to put pieces just laying around in like a container so keep the box. This figure is easily built and fun to play with.Awesome
2,Buyer beware!,"Look, I know that funk was becomming tops in the 70's. But while some may like the music, some may like the beat, this album stinks in terms of the recording and much of the music. It is like really bad theater, no understandable purpose. The Fender Rhodes mentioned in other reviews? It is so badly distorted you'll swear your speakers or amp are ... up. Then the music, Les McCann had a very political period, and as I analize it, by the way he sold out in the 80's, he'd sell out for whatever was campy at the time, to hell with the art of it. He really did some great work with Lou Rawls (which makes a more honest statement about the black experience than all that ""power"" stuff this one has. Also listen to Swiss Movement and especially ""Compared To What"" is his best and most musically compelling effort. This disc just does not have it. Oh, and emotion? Listen to ""With These Hands"" on his ""Much Les"" disc, you'll renew your marriage vows on that one dude!"
2,Hideous Houses,"I purchased this item to make ""cookie homes"" for my open house/housewarming party and they were a total bust! The cookies actually looked deformed and nothing like a house. Perhaps the cut-out should have been a bit smaller in size to accurately capture the shape of a house. Wasted kitchen investment...I could have kept my money!"
2,disappointed,"I was so excited when I got the box in the mail. But when I finally got them on my bike and took them for a ride, I was soooo DISAPPOINTED. I tried to adjusts them but nothing work. I finally took them off and installed my old brakes. The brakes worked but have no spring to them. I over paid for this brakes($15)."
4,Powerful Microwave's,"I had recieved this book last Christmas. After my exams I decided to relax and make something. I came accross this book and went through the book decided to make the star candle holders. When I put it in the microwave and put it in for low at power level 2. After the first 20 minutes, it exploded. I don't know what happened. I decided the next day to try and put it at 2 for 10 minutes with a cup of water. That didn't work either and the microwave sounded sick. I would like to know what to set it at for a 1000w microwave because there are many wonderful projects to make."
5,Nick Drake meets outer space.. on weed!,"John Dwyer (Pink and Brown, the Coachwhips) never ceases to amaze me. More experimental lo-fi accoustic extreme oddness. Like a ho down being held in the shack out back of the Mars Probe. The most perfect overstoned three am chill out record in the world. Was that a saw? I think I just creamed my jeans."
4,Plastic Envelopes,"I like Plastic Envelopes for daily use ...store the bank statements for the year, charge receits to check with statement at the end of the month, etc. I ordered these and think they are a good deal. I like the velco closures a little better, just easier. The service was very good and would certainly buy from this seller again, good proudct, fair price and good service."
3,"OK for the price, but flimsy","I guess you get what you pay for. These feel very thin and flimsy and are barely larger than a letter-size paper, which can be determined from the dimensions in the description. I guess they're also pretty durable as they described, meaning they probably won't tear easily, but they just feel thin and flimsy compared to other heavier choices out there (maybe this is a plus for some people but I was looking for a thicker version). I'll keep these since the cost to ship them back would only net me a 50-cent refund."
5,My kids loved it!,"My kids loved this video! Our copy is 19 yrs. old and I would love to have it on DVD! 'An Elephant Never Forgets' is an old, old cartoon but it was my kids favorite. They just don't make them like this anymore. Now I can share it with my grandkids!!"
2,Foghorn Leghorn: Crowing Pains,"I saw ""Crowing Pains"" on videos: ""Cartoon Crazys 1"" and ""Tweety and Sylvester""."
5,My wife enjoyed them very much,"I wanted to let you know that I received the dvd/vhs and wanted to thank you. My wife enjoyed them very much and the vhs is now in our nursery at our church, I passed on the information to the mother's as well so hopefully that will generate some orders for you. Again thank you very much and may the lord richly bless you!Best Regards,Michael ClarkAccount ExecutiveAmerican Church List"
5,"For $2 a 5 star. For $10 a...well, you get what you pay for!",Ratings have to be based on value for cost. No coffee or cocoa lover should ever pass up the opportunity to treat themselves to fine breweing when the price is right. Just don't expect a comprehensive recipe book!I do appreciate that the author didn't merely try to fill the book up with fluff so the page count could translate into a more impressive retail price - Bill Anderson.
4,Useful Writing on James,"Hartin's book does a good job of showing that one can view the book of James in a connected manner, that it is not entirely a connection of disconnected sayings. For Hartin, the unifying theme in James is that of perfection. He examines the biblical ideas of perfection and combines then with Hellenistic ideas of perfection, applying each to the book of James. His treatment of James is useful in providing a unique viewpoint on the work.He also includes a discussion about modern ideas of perfection. The common view of perfection today, Hartin argues, is very different than that in the time of James. His ideas about how the focus on perfection in James can be applied in our world are worth considering."
5,Amazing Documentary,"I purchased this documentary to supplement a 5th grade unit on slavery. I can't imagine a better way for students to learn about the experiences African Americans faced under the institution of slavery than these first hand accounts. This documentary has been wonderfully done. The 'actors' are such a small part of the overall production. Not once did it detract from the themes of the film.There were a couple bits that I choose to skip due to content and age of the audience. And while the picture painted was harsh, it was reality for those living in slavery. Clearly anyone viewing this with children of any age needs to be ready to have a heavy discussion prior to and after viewing."
1,Terribly immature,"I would have given this a book a zero, if that were available. I have no wish to be cruel, but I wonder if this author still plays with Barbie dolls. I also think she saw the Kiefer Sutherland / Charlie Sheen version of the Three Musketeers, and considered that research. Her story has even less depth than that movie, and I wouldn't have thought that possible. Don't waste the money."
5,a great romp,"Echoes of Dumas! Ms. Demarest has written a noble tribute to Dumas' adventures. I had great fun reading it. And it's one book, one beautiful, not a freakin' series, book. Pick this one up if you can if you like true heroines and heroes."
4,Good read,It was very entertaining kept you on your toes I would read more of Jaki Demarest never knew what would happen next.
3,"Not bad, but I won't be re-reading it","The presentation of historical figures was interesting, and the marriage/politics/economics were accurate for the time and place. At least we didn't see a woman with a light sword going to to toe with something three times her weight. All things being equal, skill (and luck) will win in sword work, but there was nothing to suggest that our heroine had equal weight and upper body strength compared to her male opponents. I could easily imagine Cardinal Richelieu using a woman as a spy, even an assassin using poison and daggers, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief for any of the acceptance of a woman, especially an upper class woman, as a military leader."
3,The Cardinal's Heir,"The subject could have been very interesting, unfortunately, the author turned the book into a romance novel and not a very good one."
3,good and not,"As a long time Musketeer fan, fiction or non, film or book, it is always a joy to visit old friends. This entertaining easy read opens a new window on the Paris of the Musketeers. However, this reader wishes the author had trusted the strength of the caracters, the story and the writing enough to leave out the ""Magic"". The bits and pieces seem a jarring 3rd rewrite addition marketing ploy aimed at fans of modern ""Urban Fantasy"". Not needed. The original has true magic which has served it well for centuries. This story could have stood on the adventure and romance without the shapeshifting. Still worth the read."
5,Fantastic pants!!!,"I'm 5'1 and short-legged. It's very difficult for me to find full-length pants that are short enough for me. The 29-inch length is perfect!!! The material is nice too: very sturdy, doesn't shrink after washes, and stay dry while working out. I'm going to get a few more of different colors.The only downside, if you can call that, is that these pants are not as low-waisted as they look in the picture. Maybe because I'm so short, but the waist band is right at the bottom of my belly button, which is a bit higher than I expected. But I don't mind if i wear them folded at the waist."
3,Loose fitting Drawstring pant,Great fit for ladies with fuller hips and thighs. Very comfortable to do weight training or cardio.
3,"Worked as advertised, but barely needed it","This product worked as advertised, but we barely used it on a large Hardie siding job. A circular saw (with Hardie blade), a jigsaw (with Hardie blade), and a drill (to get the jigsaw started) are all you really need to do a clean and efficient cutting job even for weirdly shaped penetrations, etc."
4,"Beauty machine, very well made","Very good machine, very good espresso, you need a lot of practice and patience, otherwise I don't have any complaint."
4,"Nice, but small","They are very cute and soft, but too small. I ordered a number 8 (I am 7.5)and they were still too small!"
2,Great Short! The movie on the other hand...,"The short, A Bird in the head is hilarious... Then there is the movie, Stop look and laugh. The only thing to look forward to about this movie was the stooge clips. It was not etertaining and actually got on my nerves quite a few times. If Colubia - Tristar plan on releasing one short with a movie, I will for sure be stopping my collection. Return to the shorts only, you want to release the movies.. do it on seperate DVD's. Otherwise you've lost a customer.. that's all I have to say about that."
2,Add one star if you're looking for a kiddie movie,"This compilation with ""The Original Three Stooges"" (that's how they're billed) was released for the Saturday-matinee crowd in 1960. The Stooges clips are familiar (the gas station, the garage, the bullfight, the pie fight, etc.) but sometimes brief (a classic sequence with Moe, Larry, and Curly pantomiming to an operatic record is unfortunately cut to the bone). Ventriloquist Paul Winchell is very funny, and The Marquis Chimps appear in a clever Cinderella sketch. STOP! LOOK! AND LAUGH! is best for little kids; serious fans will prefer their Stooges ""straight,"" in the complete, unedited episodes."
3,Could've been better.,"STOP, LOOK, AND LAUGH is an interesting compilation movie. This has some of the Stooges best shorts, A PLUMBING WE WILL GO, MICRO-PHONIES, HOW HIGH IS UP?, HALF-WITS HOLIDAY, VIOLENT IS THE WORD FOR CURLY, SOCK A BYE BABY, and HIGHER THAN A KITE. This is an interesting movie. There's some good editing on some of the films, like when Paul Winchell gets his car fixed, we're directly back to HIGHER THAN A KITE. But the clips of the Stooges are cut down way too much and there's background music that doesn't even fit and is serious music. An okay movie, but would have been better without a Cinderella sequence, the music, and some better editing."
4,"It's Winchell Mahoney Time, It's Time For Fun","The significant thing about this DVD is that it's one of the rare times Paul Winchell filmed his ventriloquist act with Jerry Mahoney and Knucklehead Smiff. Winchell was the best ventriloquist of his time in my book, and I'm thrilled that a DVD is available with his cool puppets. And The Stooges are great, as usual."
4,Monkey Gets Hit With a Pie,"Funny 3 Stooges clips tied around Paul Winchell, Jerry Mahoney, Knucklehead Smith skits. One of a kind. Just seeing the smiling monkey get hit in the face with a pie at the beginning is by itself worth the price of this one. Don't think they could get away with that anymore."
4,Back in the day,"With all due respect to Stooges fans, I saw this movie on an independent TV station back in the day.I know the story NOW, how this is a bastardized version of what the 3 Stooges are/were, and how it was made. But as a kid, I didn't know better, and this turned me on to the genius that is THE STOOGES.Great movie? No. Good introduction and for the day...not bad editing. YES!Fair enough?"
2,stop look and laugh,THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE NOTHING BUT CLIPS FROMSOME OF THEIR WORK.THE ONLY SHORT WILL BE ABIRD IN THE HEAD WHICH IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.BUT JUST 1 SHORT DOESN'T JUSTIFY 4 OR 5 STARS.IWOULD GIVE IT ONLY 1 IF THE SHORT WASN'T INCLUDED.I HOPE COLUMBIA STARTS PUTTING 6 OR MORE SHORTSON DVD FROM THE STOOGES AGAIN INSTEAD OF JUST1 SHORT.
2,"Doesnt sound good, literally","The sound that comes from this unit is not very good, in my opinion - kinda like a factory car stereo with factory speakers. The sound is only 5 watts per channel. For the same money you can get 50 watts per channel. The difference isn't just a lack of power, but you don't get a clean signal that includes highs and lows."

2,Are you going to take every Praxis examination?,"This is a good reference book for general idea of all of the teacher examinations. But if you are going to take only a few specific examinations such as Praxis II mathematics, you are buying a lot of unnecessary material. For example, the CD ROM had nothing that I needed on it.I am returning the book and CD Rom and going to purchase material that is specific to the examinations that I am taking."
2,Jargon,"This book is nothing but a bunch of jargon. I just received the results from 2 parts of the praxis test and I failed again. I studied a bunch of unnecessary information and did not feel prepared for the test. However, the General Knowledge and Communications with audio was a good predictor of what was going to be on the test."
5,excellent service,considering that the disc came all of the way from england that was good service. i was very satisited the the company.
4,Gladly we read Ed McBain,"Ed McBain is the best and this is one of his best. Matthew Hope has two cases, but only one client. The first case is Lainie Commins' battle with a big toy company over trademark rights to a cross-eyed teddy bear. The second is defending her aginst charges that she has murdered the owner of the toy company. He is also battling the after-effects of his own recent near-death experience. Matthew has to work through all these difficulties without the help of his favorite PI's Warren Chambers and Toots Kiley who are embroiled in a life-threatening subplot of their own. This complcated story is played out against the backdrop of McBain's beautifully rendered city of Colussa, Florida."
5,A fan from IL who was very GLAD to have read this Hope book,"I loved reading this book. I forced myself not to skip to the end of this book because I wanted to enjoy the ride as long as possible. McBain always teaches you something i.e. strabismusly challenged, INS in Big Bad City (which I already knew) and the subtle variations of the definition of Nocturne (I give Nocturne ***** also). I even went back and read The Black Board Jungle and enjoyed it.Criminal Conversation and Privileged Conversation are also excellent books.McBain/Hunter is an absolute gem. I always feel I've gained an experience from his books."
3,Excellent for mailing labels,"These labels are excellent for mailing labels, labeling cardboard boxes, etc... HOWEVER, I made several to put on plastic gun boxes and they seemed PERFECT at first, then they started peeling off the gun cases... I hate that, because they are so easy to use in my printer and are the perfect size... I have to use glue to get them to stick to my plastic gun cases... other than that, they are super labels... the print well, align good and look super."
4,Mostly great,They worked great but an odd thing to pick at is the 3x4 sheet is a 4x6 cut in half. Problem is the half isn't exact so you'll have to adjust to that. I'm a engineer so I could just be expecting thing to be more exact it was off my 3mm or more.
5,Good History,I got this book for my geneology research as my ancestors are listed in the book. The Moravians kept extensive records.
4,More than I bargained for.,An intriguing book and the winner of the 1984 Gold Medalion Book Award. Covers the lives of three generations struggling for authenticity and honor. I found the book filled with insight and wisdom. The character of Jael could have been more fully developed. I found myself wanting to read a sequel. (There is none as far as I can tell.)
2,Won't work for LP Smartside,"I needed these for installing LP SmartSide-12"" width. The ""hook"" end of these were not wide enough for the SmartSide (James Hardie is slightly thinner), and they would not work for anything BUT a 1 1/4"" overlap.I have tried several brands with no success until I tried a brand sold here called SoloSider (see my review for them).These, like most Malco products, are quailty built, but will only work for certain siding and a fixed reveal/overlap."
3,Malco FCG2 1-1/4 inch overlap Fiber Cement Siding Guage,The Malco FCG2 was a great help in allowing me to hang 12 feet long Fiber Cement Lap Panels Boards. There was no instructions included on the package on how to use the metal hangers so it took a few trys to get it right. The boards rested very well on the hanger and were stable when the Lap Panel was set vertical. The negative issue with the guage is the overlap was not 1-1/4 inch as specified. The overlap was actually 1-3/4 inch which I did not discover until I had hung up 4 lap panels. This extra 1/2 inch overlap would cause me to not have enough lap panels to cover the height of the wall. I had calculated the amount of 8 inch panels needed using 1-1/4 inch overlap. I added a 1/2 inch spacer to the guage and this corrected the overlap to the correct 1-1/4 inch.I hope other people have not had this problem when purchasing the Malco siding guage from Gradys Hardware Inc. They were the lowest in price of the suppliers listed on Amazon.
4,Wonderful extra hands!,"Purchased to assist with residing a 1200 sq ft house. Helped to hold and properly space floppy 12' Hardie boards so one person could work the job. Only problem is that sometimes nailing from the brackets caused a bow out at the bottom of the board, so we developed a work around. All in all, it would have been almost impossible to do the job without these hangers."
4,Very useful,"Take a little practice to use effectively, but overall a very useful tool and make it easier to run siding if working alone."
5,These clips make all the difference,I needed to reside part of my house and purchased the Malco clips because they were cheap and recommended. I had never done siding before and these made it come out perfect! My wife said that it looked like a professional did it and her friends asked for the name of the contractor's name. These clips will allow you to get the job done efficiently and professionally (especially if you get the Pac Tool shears too).
1,Needs a little rethinking,"This tool is ok but if high quality is your standard then I would suggest finding another siding gauge. The instructions are not complete on how to use this tool. If you use this tool, only put a few nails in the plank to moderately hold the plank in place, then remove the tool before nailing the plank off. If you completely nail the plank and remove the tool you have clapping on your plank (open space between the plank being nailed and the previousily installed plank). The only place I used this tool was on gables and cheek gables when I only wanted one person on the staging."
2,too many steps,This tool is a good idea but I found it was too many steps. Its not that it didn't work but I tried another gauge that was similar and it seemed to be more user friendly with less steps.
3,Works alright but...,"This tool works exactly as advertised with a few words of caution! If you're hanging fiber cement siding by yourself this tool will come in handy and I would have rated it higher except that it holds the plank too far out from the overlap piece and allows the nails to blow through the surface of the plank too easily. If you're going to use this tool, here's what I found works very well. Use it to hold the plank at the far end, nail your plank on at the other end and then go to the tool end and remove it and nail on the plank, then fill in the nails inbetween the ends, works really well with far fewer blow throughs. If used this way the tool gets 5 star rating."
4,You can't do it alone,"While these gauges aren't going to necessarily get you perfect spacing on your siding, they do permit you to actually put siding up all by yourself. Keep in mind that if the wall you are working on is not perfectly square, you'll have to tweak the spacing of your siding and the guages won't do this, though they will give you the 'third hand' that you'll need."
3,"Great idea, execution could use help","Granted I am new to Haskell and to some degree functional programming. I thought this book would be really cool, pretty much an ideal book on a subject matter that I am very interested in. The text is definitely easy to follow for the most part, but WHY, WHY use a 'Times new roman' type font for the code samples? The code samples are basically in the same font as the text only in italics, making it hard to figure out what is supposed to be whitespace, which I find a pretty strange decision for a textbook on a language where layout matters..."
3,Odd,"I admit, I did not read the book very much. I looked through it and the format of everything was really weird. The code snippets used characters one cannot type in what seemed to me to be a variable width font. It bothered me for some reason."
3,Not a good first book,"This book is well thought out and well written, but makes a poor introduction to Haskell. The first few chapters are great as the author spends a lot of time laying the foundation of functional programming and Haskell. However, the author skips the intermediate level items and goes straight to the more difficult aspects without enough explanation. I simply could not follow many of the later examples. Furthermore, some of the chapters did not introduce any new concepts and instead were there only to complete the examples - something I found frustrating as that space could have been used to better describe some of the concepts. All in all this could be a good book for more advanced Haskellers looking for real world examples, but I would shy away from it."
4,Good book.,"This is a good book... However, I wish I hadn't bought it. It seems to focus too much on geometry and multimedia, which is not that interesting to me. (Yes, I knew that when I bought the book).Anyway, my problem with it is that it seems more suited to someone who'll learn in a ""linear"" way, going through all chapters (maybe because functions defined in previous chapters are used in the others). I'd rather get a book with self-contained chapters (for example, I've learned Lisp with Peter Seibel's ""Practical Common Lisp"", and I jumped around, reading chapters as I felt like, or as I needed them). But it's great if you don't mind having to go through all of it.Maybe it's me, I don't know. I just didn't really like it."
4,Happy,"The concepts in the book are great. It is fairly easy to follow. The problem is most of the examples are based upon a graphics library that doesn't exist any longer. It would be great if there was a second edition, which updated the examples."
2,Is fun if you like a fantasy pinball game.,The game is fun hence the How much fun is this game is a full 5 stars.But I don't like fantasy pinball games so I only gave an overall rating of 2 stars.I am more into the real table pinball games like thePinball Hall of Fame The Gottlieb CollectionAnd thePinball Hall of Fame: The Williams CollectionThose two are very true to the original pinball machines in both graphics and sounds!
3,Frustratingly Entertaining,"If you like doing tedious things over and over until you scream so loud that your neighbors hear you, you'll love this game. It took me back to the old classic Nintendo days, when you had to do 20 minutes worth of annoying goals to get to a boss, just to lose in 30 seconds and have to do it all over again. By your 4th or 5th attempt, screaming commences.But it is still a fun, original game. The difficulty is OK, I just don't care for tedious goals."
2,Flippers Have a Delay,"i was very excited to play this game, and it is visually awesome to look at, but extremely frustrating! there is a definite delay between when you hit the button and the flipper actually moves! several seconds! i had to give up planning shots, and just hit the buttons repeatedly. i'm surprised no one else has mentioned this in a review, it would have been helpful. i've since seen the same comment on other websites, and i wish i would've seen it before purchasing."
3,Tiny!,"Nice bag but I cant fit my laptop in it. I can put a pile of 8.5x11 books/magazines in it, my sketchbook and some pens/pencils in the pouch.The pouches and compartments are plentiful, but small and almost crammed on top of each other. This bag would be fantastic if it only were 10-15% larger.As a Hellboy fan, I love the bag. For practical use, It just doesnt cut it."
4,Good replacement.,"These are a good replacement for the cheap stock lug nuts that come on the Chrysler/Dodge LX platform. Solid all metal construction not the junk ""capped"" ones."
4,great lug nuts,"I needed to replace the factory lug nuts on my Dodge Charger, since they come with those cheap 2 piece cap nuts that always wear out after they get over tightened or the garage uses the in-pack gun on them. These lug nuts fit perfectly with my factory alloy rims and are a solid one piece lug nuts that look just as good if not better. The price of one of the factory lug nut is more then the pack of four of these. I replaced all of them and feel safer knowing that if I get a flat tire I will not have any problems changing the tire in an emergency. Good product and a good price."
5,"Buffalo Bill, jr.","I enjoy watching Buffalo Bill , Jr. because it's new to me. I'd never seen this tv show before. Thanks."
1,Author lacks credentials,"I found this book to lack depth, perhaps it is the lack of education on behalf of the author. The author is a novice.I have read several books about the Messiah, the Christ or the Anointed One. I have further read books about the nature of God, including His substance, nature and purpose.I would avoid this book, it struggles to keep your attention and has a difficult time staying focused."
1,A Waste,"(...)the ""proof"" this author uses is pathetic and desperate, in response to the critics asking ""where did Jesus EVER say ""I AM GOD"", this author childishly answers ""Was there ever any need for him to?""So this book wants us to be ignorant to the fact that God said ""I AM GOD"" in the OT nearly 200 times, yet Jesus NEVER said it once?Yes, Jesus needed to say ""I AM GOD"" because the fact that he ran from rock throwing Jews and could not save himself makes most of the world skeptical that he can save anyone.Don't waste your time or money on juvenile chicken feed. Instead get some scholarly books sold on amazon such as;The Doctrine of the Trinity: Christianity's Self-Inflicted Wound by Sir Anthony BuzzardWhen Jesus Became God: The Struggle to Define Christianity during the Last Days of Rome by Richard E. RubensteinJesus-God or the Son of God? A Comparison of the Arguments by Brian HoltPaganism and Christianity, 100-425 C.E.: A Sourcebook by Ramsay MacMullenJohn B"
1,Nothing more then islamic junk.,"This is a muslim book, not a christian one. Allah, aka Satan, always appears as an angel of light. So he is trying to hide this as a ""christian"" book."
1,Old edition,"I was conned into buying this book. I own an older (flawed) edition. The publication date is specified as 6/10/2003 (by Amazon). No such date appears in the book, which states that the work was originally published in 1999.I would have waited for the next edition rather than buy a version that is already five years old."
5,"Unique, Quirky Educational FUN!","I bought this CD/DVD combo years ago when it first came out and my kids STILL love to watch the DVD and listen to the CD! TMBG are classic and get kid's imaginations to SOAR! The music, the lyrics, and images are so catchy and fun that even my hubby and I like to watch and listen to the DVD and CD! Check out their Here Come the 123's DVD/CD combo...another, equally fun, unique way to teach kid's their numbers and number concepts. Once again, even my hubby and I like listening to the CD and watching the DVD! Both combos are must haves for anyone who has kids!"
1,Unsatisfied,"This was not as I expected. My little girl can't even sit through it. It is actually very strange and unusual and the songs? How is that teaching the children ABC's. I definitelly did not like it. Unless you are with a group of children teaching the children these songs, I would not suggest it."
2,Big Disappointment,"We bought this toy for play at the lake. It does rock slightly, but it takes major effort. Our kids said it was too much work. Also, it is hard for the children to get into. We give it two stars simply because the kids figured out if they turned it over, it could be used as a ""fort"". I would not recommend this product."
4,Boys's Tracker Plush...Vol 1,"This is a very invaluable resource guide to Boyds Bears...it is done in an exceptionally easy to use format, with lots of good pictures to make sure of your bears' identity, complete with a good sense of humor"
5,bankruptcy facts,"It appears that very few people really understand the dark side of bankruptcy. Yes, there's a good reason for a bankruptcy law, but it's not a panacea and there are many negative implications that people don't understand. This booklet really helps the reader make a more informed decision, and may help a lot of people avoid making a bad mistake. Bottom line? Only people who simply can never reasonably repay their debt should file bankruptcy. Nothing's free, and there are prices for bankruptcy."
3,Missing key features,"Box has video out to run a second monitor, but it is crippled with ""Mirror Mode"" only. That second monitor will only display what is already on the first monitor.Firewire 400 is ok, but 800 is the new standard. 800 is backward compatible. Apple saved like $2 by not including both 400 and 800 Firewire jacks.The Apple upgrades are way overpriced. If you can use a screwdriver always buy the base box from Apple and add your own HDD and RAM. Too bad Apple has no option to delete the keyboard and mouse on their ""custom"" order pages."
3,Read Reviews First,"I was considering buying an Imac g5 17 or 20in. especially after reading so many glowing reviews on this website and others. Though after reading a recent www.cnet.com review on the 17-inch wide-screen display, a 1.8GHz G5 processor model which receive a ""good"" rating from them. I have changed my mind at least at this price! Lack of ram (256mb)standard, middle of the road graphics card, and bluetooth and wifi costing extra, less upgradable than the last one, in addition to no firewire 800. All this seams to point to form over function. I have used one and admit it has an impressive screen and overall design though they definetly seem to be marketing it towards those who are willing to pay alot and overlook performance. Read the review at cnet and what for some big sales."
1,Won't work without a highend video card,Initially I could not get this card to work at all in my PC. I had to go to their website and download the FAQs file and follow those instructions to get it to work. There is very little support on their site for this model. I paid $29 for it and that's $29 to much. If you don't have a high end video card installed in your system you will NOT be able to display HDTV channels. I have an VisionTek ATI Radeon HD 2400 Pro installed and it still refuses to display HD Channels correctly. I don't recommend this product.
3,"Interesting, but not what I'd hoped","Very simple & vague, compared with the tarot or more complex oracle decks. I just haven't found it as rich or enlightening an experience as other oracle decks."
5,they work for me,I bought this deck two months ago. I am satisfied with them. They are quite accurate about my current state of mind. They help me get back on track :)
4,Not Tarot cards - but very very usefull and fun,I've been using different set of tarot cards for years. Now these Oracle Cards are in my hands. They are very usefull and presise - buy them and use them for troubleshooting - the drawings are full of symbols.Fun to use and think about.Annette
5,Love it!,They are great! They are beautifully done and written. I have purchased other cards from Sonia Choquette and I love all of them. She does great work!
4,Helping you trust your intution,"This deck was great for helping you trust what you already know. It is also a matter of being open to it. When I first saw this deck, I hated the colors and coloring, it seems muddy and dark to me. I sold the deck.I got them again. This time, I appreciated the messages she wrote, Expect the best, ask your guides, ask your runners and the booklet seemed helpful in telling you how to handle the predicament you are currently in. I feel this is a helpful deck good for beginners, advanced readers might want something like her Soul lessons deck or Messages from Angels by Doreen Virtue PhD. This deck also might appeal to men, because of the art in this deck. It is not girlie, for lack of a better description."
4,Shagtastic Sound-o-licious Score,"A fun and entertaining, soundfall, of music. The scores from both Austin Powers movies on one disc! What more could you want? Part 007, part farce, and pure Austin. Everything from the main action themes to the softer pussycat stuff is just great. As Austin Powers would say, ""Yeah, BABY!"""
4,Unusual Griffith Role,"I saw this one a long time ago. It is a good drama with excellent acting that has a nice twist in the end. Andy Griffith played a bad guy in this one which is an unusual role for him. He did it well. Some accomplished character actors play supporting roles including Noah Berry Jr. The action is fairly low-key. There is violence but the movie emphasizes the malevolence of Griffith's character and his cynicism over blood and gore. It is a character piece and a bit of a survival tale.One reason that this movie so interests me is that I now own the old gas-station building that was used in the beginning and ending scenes. If you are a Griffith fan, you will be surprised with him in this one but impressed. It was probably shot on a low budget but it came through well."
5,"Great item, works great",This is an excellent one piece double boiler. It works flawlessly and is fun to use. This item is also very well made and seems to be very durable. I was impressed by the very thick heavy base on the pot and it comes to a boil very fast. I'm very glad I bought this item. Highly recommended.
2,great idea not durable,"Received this item for christmas, out of the box with a dangling handle(was purchased at store). Exchanged it received the shipment today, right out of the box with a broken handle. Good idea but sure doesn't seem very durable."
5,Forget the double broiler,"I've owned this for over a year and it is very handy for melted cheeses, chocolate and keeping sauces on very low heat. Quality is great and it's real easy to clean."
2,nomsupera las espectativas,"el producto no supera las espectativas, es muy corta la pantaloneta, y tiene ciertos imoerfectos, no tiene bolsillos a ninguno de los lados."
1,Champion shorts,"Not the item I expected. It did not contain the pockets as advertised and was too small in the waist (i.e., it was an L; not an XL; although the size label designates it as XL)."
2,They run small!,"These seem like OK gym shorts, but they run very small (or they shrink). The elastic is quite strong, so make sure you get the right size!!"
1,NOT 100% Cotton,Total Bait and Switch. This item was not as advertised. Some of us can ONLY wear 100% cotton clothing. Anything less causes a rash. That's why I ordered this product from Amazon. The advertising still says 100% cotton. Totally useless to me..
3,"OK, but no pockets","Overall quality is fine, but be aware: no pockets. No pockets. No pockets. No pockets. No pockets. No pockets. No pockets."
2,I agree with other reviewers' observations,"I agree with other reviewers. To wit:1. The elastic band is left exposed on the inside; this chafes and is uncomfortable2. There are no pockets (not a huge deal)3. These inseam on these shorts is shorter than on other cotton gym shorts sold by Champion... it must be 5-6""?These shorts are almost like fancy boxers rather than being real gym shorts"
5,Jersey shorts,"I bought two of these Champion Mens Jersey shorts, granite heather medium--one for me and one for my dad. They are a very comfortable fit."
2,Does not have pockets,"Have other Champion Jersy Shorts. These were the least cost of the Champion line, If I had been aware thery did not have pockets would have purchased Jersey pants with pockets."
1,Ultra-thin fabric; sizing way off,"First, these shorts are made out of some of the thinnest fabric imaginable. I understand the drive to keep costs low, but this is ridiculous. And the sizing? I bought medium because that supposedly matched my waist measurement. Ha ... maybe sized for a medium elephant ... way, way too big for me."
3,8187 Ringspun cotton Gym Shorts,Yes sizing runs a slighter smaller than indicated.The elastic band is rough on bare skin. I wear a jock with 3in band so the ban doesn't bother me.for $8.97 plus 99 cent shipping these are great. At 13 bux no way.
2,Could be a knock off,Not authentic Champion Rugby shorts. No pockets....received xx large instead of x large. Kept them because husband removed tags before telling me about the pockets and size.
1,Not all of these shorts are 100% cotton.,"I ordered two pair of these shorts in XLarge, 1 Granite Heather and 1 Maroon. The gray shorts were 60% cotton and 40% polyester. The red were 100% cotton. The gray blend shorts were scratchy and uncomfortable. The red cotton shorts were fine."
5,Nice and thin,"These shorts are thin and that's what I wanted. I looked specifically for POCKET-FREE shorts because I like to sleep in them and I don't want a bunch of fabric binding me up at night. Besides, who in their right mind wants their shorts falling off from a heavy wallet or cell phone stuck in the pocket?"
4,Great shorts,"Good build and quailty, only wish I had noticed they have no pockets at all, but that is my mistake."
2,No Pockets,"I was surprised that this short had no pockets. For the price, it is a little expensive to come without pockets. Also, the material is very thin. Not the quality I expected."
2,No pockets,I was disappointed with this item. There are no pockets and the waistband is irritating. Debated on a one or two star rating.
3,Would not purchase again,I purchased 1 Large Granite Heather short.Size seems a bit smaller than largeExposed elastic waistbandNo PocketsThin materialOdd fitting
2,Elastic waistband hurts,"I agree with the buyer above; these shorts become very uncomfortable after 30 minutes because the elastic waistband is inexplicably left exposed. Otherwise, ehhhh, you get what you pay for when you pay 8 bucks...cheap looking, cheap shorts."
5,I'm old school I guess,"I work out and the cotton/jersey, plain old gym shorts are my preference over the current in store offerings of nylon mesh shorts with pockets. These shorts don't ""squirm"" around like the nylon one went working out on a bench! I like 'em"
3,Ok I guess....,"I like these shorts, but the material is... ugh something that's hard to adjust to. I bought these shorts mainly to walk around indoors, and they serve that purpose very well, but I will consider buying some made with a different texture next time."
4,Uh....their shorts alright.,"Hey. They are cheap and came in the color I needed. Plus they have no pockets which is what I wanted (but could not find anywhere else). They came quickly, fit fine, and will do everything a pair of cotton shorts should do, I think. They aren't space age, they don't wick (what ever that is), or hyper what ever, and my sweat doesn't glow in the dark when I wear them to work out. But, they keep my stuff covered and are nice and comfy plus..... like I said, they are really inexpensive."
4,Not bad,"I purchased these after Hanes quit making these. Perhaps they still do, but I've looked high and low to no avail. So I purchased these. They aren't bad. The material is a little thinner and they have ZERO pockets, hence my 4 star rating. I would buy again."
2,No pockets,These shorts have no pockets. Never saw shorts without pockets.Would not have ordered if I had Known about this.
1,"very thin, lightweight fabric","I thought Champion brand == quality. Well, not so.The product is barely thicker than boxer shorts (that is, men's undergarments). OK, it is a little, but not much.Also, there are no pockets. Also #2, the ""silver grey"" is quite light; I wanted darker.I guess it's fine for the money... but I wanted something different.On a positive note, sizing is correct (I ordered a men's L)."
1,Poor quality,"Again, I say the quality of Champion products has deteriorated. The fabric is so thin and cheap. I wish the company would raise the prices instead of cutting back on quality!"
4,Cheap Gym Shorts Shipped on time,Cheap Gym shorts that I can tear up and not worry about. Do not care about style or impressing anyone just plain old shorts that are a good price.
2,Not the best,"The product has a major flaw that can be easily remedied. The hooks have a high tendency to fall off. However, if you pinch them shut it does do well."
3,Cheap,"Ordered black, received blue. On first use one of the cords broke at a knot. You get what you pay for, pay cheap, get cheap."
3,Survivor series 2002,"I loved watching the very first elimination chamber match, but would have like to have seen at least one survivor series match."
4,"well, not too damn bad","this is your basic survivor series ppv with crazy matches and some surprising action.first off the elimination chamber match. big props go to HHH for winning the title but more than that for surviving a RVD knee to the throat. are you kidding me?? wow!!! hell of a match that will definately be duplicated hopefully many times. big props to everyone in that match. and once again the heart break kid showing us a glimpse of the past.also in the ppv, the 1st women's hard core match in nearly 4 years. try to forget that first one, as it is brought up in another dvd (hardcore one) trish and victoria took it and turned it up past 10 and ended somewhere near 14. ending was a little tough to swallow but the match itself had me doing a familar holy **** chant with the other guys i was watching it with.the other matches, well, not too bad. however if you watch the action, you'll see what i wrote. overall not a bad one time lookover."
1,If only there were a '0 stars' option,"OK, first of all I have been watching wrestling for 24+ years, seen every PPV the WWF/E has put out and this is by far the worst. This is nothing like the greatness the WWE is putting out nowadays. For example, night after night John Cena and Randy Orton are putting on wrestling displays and getting standing ovations... Where was I when the WWE turned to crap in 2002? Psycho Drivers? 630 Splashes? The fans don't want fast paced action. They want to see more classic finishers such as the RKO and the F-U. When I'm sitting in my Mom's basement watching this crap, I get so angry that I just pop in a Kevin Nash match to calm me down. The Jacknife Powerbomb... Ah, now THAT's a finisher. Anywho, to sum it up, all of the matches sucked. Spend your money on New Year's Revolution '05. You'll be happier."
5,Loved this show.,"Lot's of great moments.The tag match with Jeff Hardy, Bubba Ray Dudley and 3 minute warning was great.Scott Steiner debuted and was impressive.The Elimination Chamber match was unforgettable.I loved it. If you like HBK you should buy this dvd along with Summerslam 2002, and Armageddon 2002."
3,3rd best pay-per-view of the year,"This was an alright survivor series. I will make a list of the matches, best to worst.Worst Matches:Jamie Noble vs. Billy KidmanGood Matches:6 man table matchHardcore rules womens title matchBrock Lesnar vs. Big ShowGreatest Matches:Elimination ChamberTriple Threat Elimination Tag Team MatchOverall, I wouldn't suggest you buy this, but you are free to buy it if you want.If you want real action, get the following:St. Valentines day MassacreSummerslam 1999,2000 or 2002WrestleMania 17 or 18No Mercy 1999,2000,2001, or 2002Royal Rumble 1999,2000,2001, or 2002Armageddon 1999 or 2000"
4,Sweet Compilation,"An excellent variety of Duke Ellington's music which includes both vocals and instrumentals. While the quality of each recording is not perfect, the imprefections add to the ambience associated with listening to the originals on the radio."
5,"Perfect fit, easy to change","This Fram Oil Filter was purchased for a 2001 Kia Sportage, this is my third oil change for this particular car that I'm doing my self. The problem I had with the first time I started doing my own oil changes is that the cheap part stores filters that the oil change place had put on this car would seize up and would take some effort to remove. These fram filters come off by hand after being on the car for three months with no problems. Makes changes easier and less of a headache."
3,"Super cute, not too practical","These shoes don't have very much traction, so they're no good for playing, but they're insanely adorable!"
4,"Very detailed, otherwise suspenseful","""The Tiger in the Well"" is a very detailed book. It's very good though, and I liked it better than ""Shadow in the North"" (too confusing for me). However, despite the details, it is interesting to see the grown-up Sally that we once knew as a child in ""Ruby in the Smoke"". She has a daughter now, Harriet. This establishes that she has two things she loves that can be taken away from her: her business and her daughter. Then the plot whirls from there... a very suspenseful read."
3,A bit disappointing...,"I was looking forward to reading 'The Tiger in the Well' after enjoying the first 2 books in the Sally Lockhart Trilogy. But after a huge build up of exciting events during which Sally and her young daughter Harriet try to protect themselves from the threat of the evil Tzaddik, I had worked out the twist halfway through the book and was very much let down by the ending. Not the best offering from Pullman."
4,A RIVETING NOVEL,"This book is truly one of the best I have ever read. Usually, I am a romance reader, but this book captured my imagination. The way the characters come together with the same purpose (to get the Tzaddik) is truly intriguing. I have not read the other books in the trilogy yet, but I am sure I will enjoy them. I encourage anyone with a love for adventure and mystery to read this."
2,weakest of the set,"There are great things about this book. I really liked the non stero typical Jews in the book, from the Jewish Gangster with hopes of being in the Cabinet, to stary eyed Zioniests with everyone in between. However, I do not understand the actions of main character at the end, would she not have tried to help people she wants to help through world of investment that she understands. Also there is a whole inter marrage question not even delt with. Plus page after page is wasted on the kid having an accident, and whole chapter which does nothing to move the story should have been left out. What is worst disappoment is some of it seems to have been recycled from the second book."
1,Mystery or Manifesto??,I give it one star. I was wanting to read a suspense novel not Das Kapital. This book wants us to think that if people have so many kids that they can't feed them it is because of capitalism. If a man gets drunk and burns his own child that it is the because of capitalism. PLEASE!!!!!!
4,"Strange, good, satisfying","I loved Philip Pullman's ""His Dark Materials"" trilogy so much, so I picked up his Sally Lockhart series to keep my glow going. They're really good; not quite as incredible as the HDM books, but very interesting, engaging and suspenseful. I loved the first book in the series; the second was confusing but very good too. This one, book 3, was a very odd book, with odd characters, to put it mildly. But it was even more gripping than the previous Sally Lockhart installment. Some awful things happen in it, too; I cried several times throughout reading this. I most definitely recommend this, but read books 1 and 2 first, to get the background of the characters and their motivations."
5,The third in the Sally Lockhart trilogy is a masterpiece.,"Philip Pullman's wonderful and gripping fantasy books, ""The Golden Compass"" and ""The Subtle Knife"" made me want to read more of his work. This led me to the Sally Lockhart books, all of which I enjoyed. Although, with ""The Tiger in the Well"", Pullman tops himself. The exploration of Sally's character in a desperate situation (and the vivid reconstruction of the historical period she inhabits) makes this a modern masterpiece. Wow, what a book!"
3,Not as good...,"This book was not as good as the first two. Two of the main characters were off in South America half the time. I would still recommend the first two books, which in turn you will have to read the last, its just not as good. I still miss Fredrick!"
3,disappointing finish,"i liked Ruby in the Smoke and REALLY liked Shadow in the North. unfortunately, this book just doesn't compare. it's gripping in some parts and still fast-paced, but all the stuff about anti-semitism and socialism kind of weigh down the story. i wasn't particularly impressed with Goldberg, he sounded too ""perfect anti-hero,"" what with the brains and the big goals and the blather that can move a crowd. and it sucked even MORE when you could tell what was developing b/w him and Sally. Goldberg is nothing compared to Frederick!!! sigh. and i thought the ending was just really anti-climactic.anyway, this book is fine. but it's not the best. not by far."
5,super blades,these are unbeatable dewalt quality blades and a nioce storage case to keep it all together with room for a ton of blades. Wish it came with more blades
5,buy it,definitely worth the price. hard case is excellent. you even have a fourth spot in the case for a different blade.
4,Great set of blades,"This is a great set of blades they are sharp and keep a good edge. I orderd these with my hitichi saw and they work great. However I did find these blades a little short, I needed to cut a double header out and had to run to home depot to get a longer blade."
5,Dewalt cant be beat/great prices,My guys use DeWalt products all of the time. They are constantly building something. One is a professional carpenter. The DeWalt products take a beating. These were available at a great price and arrived quickly.
4,They work!,"They're yellow, with teeth, and they go back and forth to cut through various materials. I have no complaints! These work as advertised."
4,Dewalt blade set,"Blades are fine, last all right. The sticker on the inside of the box is next to impossible to remove 100%, might go using rubbing alcohol."
3,Dewalt Saw Blade Tough Case Set,"I'm not sure of the purpose of the case. It is made of almost all plastic and difficult to open and close. I guess much usage would break it in. I'd rather have just bought the blades by themselves. I'm not in need of something to just sit in my tools cabinet when I'm only going to use the saw to trim fruit trees about once or twice a year.I can fit the blades into the saw horizontally but have yet to figure out how to fit the blades in the saw vertically! Maybe I need a different kind of blade. No instructions included, so I guess the manufacturer assumed that whoever used the blades was a professional and used the tool and blades in daily work..."
4,Dewalt Sawzall Blades,"I have not yet used my Dewalt Sawzall blades, but I am sure I will be satisfied with their performance when I use them. Dewalt is a good and reliable brand and upon examination you can see that these blades are heavy duty and will perform well."
4,Love the case,Its the case that makes all the difference. I love having the blades organized this way.
4,New,I've not had a reason to use any of these blades yet and I have no doubt that they will do what I need. Main reason for my purchase was price. Most blades of the Tpi's that I wanted included in a nice case for a very good price.
3,PS I Love You by Valerie Parv (Large Print Harlequin),"Description from the book back cover:""Dear Mr. Branden, I'm sure you receive thousands of letters, but this one is different, so please, please read on ... ""How Penny Sullivan wished her young niece had never written that desperate plea! For, with a cruel twist of fate, it brought Reid Branden back into her life ... Years ago, the loss of his love, his trust, had bruised her tender heart, but the memory of his kisses still lingered. Confronted with his powerful charisma a second time, could Penny hold on to the lessons of the past?"
4,Chicken Seasoning,"The Crockery Gourmet Seasoning Mix for Chicken is great. Sometimes I use their recipe, but I also use the seasoning and my own additions. I also use it whenever I want to give a nice seasoning to my famous homemade Chicken Soup. Very versatile and very tasty."
3,Prospective CCNA,"I found this to be a useful tool, but it has many annoying operational ""anomalies"". I went to the Sybex website for program updates, but none exist. I called Sybex tech support, and there are no fixes, and they have no plans to release any. For the price of the product, the length of time it has been out (over a year), and the publisher's resources, the product support is poor."
2,"Good foundation, but not needs updating for 607 test...","This is a good package to get used to configuring routers and switches, but it does not provide enough to pass the new (607) test. Your editorial reviews state that the Virtual Gold package gives you ""everything and more"" to handle the simulations. This is flatly not true--the actual test simulations are totally different than your package. I was very frustrated when I took the test to find the simulations so completely different. Also, they had troubleshooting simulations your package did not offer, as well as portions not even covered by your package! Someone obviously just changed the 640-507 to 640-607 in their editorial review. This package needs to be updated, and someone needs to pay attention to the accuracy of their claims! This may have been great for the 507 exam, but not the new one."
1,Great idea rotten execution,"I was thrilled to see this product offered and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. That was where the love affair ENDED.First there are tons of applications it doesn't work with or must be disabled before even attempting to use it. Then while trying to do the exercises in the lab book, and the Sybex CCNA Study Guide the application locks, doesn't recognize the commands, and sometimes refuses to respond at all.This was the worst ($) I ever spent. Fortunately there are other lab resources on the web and I also enrolled in the Cisco classes."
2,Limited Value,"I find this Lammle's virtual trainer to be rather buggy. For example, the cursor often appears on the wrong line and editing keys such as delete often don't work. Now that it is possible to telnet into actual labs for $5-$10 per hour, this trainer is superfluous. Don't waste your time. Use the real thing."
3,Quite Good But Some Annoying Faults,I got this as part of a CCNA course so that we can practice at home. For most practice labs used in the Sybex Book by Todd Lammle it is quite adequate. However given the expensive price of this it irks me no end that one of the biggest problems is with the help and the autocompletion with tab on the cisco router. Often you press a command such as log? and it will only show a couple of the options or say ambiguous command. I think this a big failing considering that people using it are learners. You definitely need to use a real router as well
2,CCNA Virtual E-lab at what price...,"I was really let down with this product. It is a lot to pay for just a cd and a 61 page manual, that reiterates what is on the cd. The product may very well offer a person the opportunity to configure routers and switches, but from the moment I opened the 1st lab, the dearth of available commands became very noticeable and debilitating. I would not recommend this to other users unless you are prepaired to have a colleague(s) take you to a site where you can get a free-ware version that offers the same functionality."
1,Specific and not clear configuration needed,"As a lab, i didn't have the oportuniti to know if it was good, as nobody in the company could answer why two different CD's were failing in the execution of the program.Only i have to say, unless you verify first that you have the right configuration (and that's something that you will have to find out by yourself when you buy the product, as the configuration shown in the box is not enough) it's better not to waist your time on this product."
2,ccna software,"I just picked up this software and I have to say that although the idea is a great one, the software is a little buggy and not 100% functional. I've had trouble with password verification and I end up having to restart the program which is a big hassle when you are in the middle of a lab. Since the program is holding me back from completing the labs I would have to say that the product is not quite there yet. Unless I can resolve the issue, I will most likely be returning it when I get the chance."
5,e-trainer,"I have been going through Todd Lammle's CCNA Study Guide in preparation for my CCNA exam. There were some concepts that I was not clear on. I then came across the virtual lab e-trainer. This program has not only helped clarify concepts but has given me the hands on experience that I have needed! The program is easy to use and the labs, for the most part, are straight forward and very educational. I can experiment with different network configurations to see what works and what does not. My exam is coming up in April and I now feel much more confident going into my exam. I would highly recommend this product."
2,"Good idea, but old information.","In trying to follow along with the trainer, a professional CBT on the subject, and the book, I ran into problems with the trainer being set up with Version 5.x commands and the current versions are 11.x so, many of the commands just do not work. It's a great idea if they would just update the software. They should add some sample traffic and do a better job of providing a real-world simulation. It's a good alternative to 'no-hands-on', but it could be better."
3,A great help....but has problems,"I have found the trainer to be most helpful. Fortunately I work with ""router people"" who have helped me get through the mistakes in the software. Worth the money, yes. An end all resource, no."
2,VERY over-rated,"Soooo many commands aren't supported. Pretty buggy, too. Now, the study guide by Lammle was excellent(good enough to help me pass), but the sim is pretty cheesy."
1,buy only if desperate,The Sybex Virtual e-lab Trainer would have been a decent $... software package. No way is it worth $...! It is buggy and very limited in what you can do. Some commands don't seem to work at all. Consider it only if you've never worked on a router before and don't have a clue about how to get access to one.
5,MCSE CCNA,"The best ""EQUIPMENT"" I had to pass the CCNA...I just wonder where is the E-trainer for CCNP?"
2,Not good enough,I had hoped that e-trainer would save me from spending hours in the lab but I was extremely disappointed. I found the simulation program sloppy and clunky and quite limited. Lammle has another product ... which is more expensive but looks more powerful. I wish I knew that the kinks were worked out on that product but I haven't tried it. There is an upgrade price from etrainer to routersim.
2,ccna v.lab,"A basic lab setting will help you to break the ice.If you are serious about CCNA there are better ones in the market place.Only around 10 guided labs. For those who not have hands-on router/switch experience, the Virtual Lab will give some insight into configurations assuming that you have done your regular textbook reading.You are going to need much more if you wish pass the CCNA exam."
2,"Not unless you are desperate for ""hands on""","I picked this up after I passed the CCNA, because I'm trying to help a friend and because I'm getting ready for ACRC. The reviews which point out the bugs are accurate. Many of the included labs don't work AT ALL: access lists, telnet to multiple routers, etc. Don't bother with this product unless you are DESPERATE to get some hands on OR unless they issue a bug fix/new version. Great idea, but very disappointing quality."
3,Good Tool for Practicing But...,...a lot of annoying errors crept up while trying to run several of the labs. If it were not for the errors (which could possibly lead someone to select the wrong answer on the CCNA test) this product would easily earn four stars. I'd also like to see more of the IOS commands available for use.
5,A huge value for only the would be CCNA,"This software is a huge value for anybody who wants to be a CCNA. I know, I'm studying for my CCNA. The e-Trainer emulates the look and feel of actually being on three routers and an ethernet switch. It doesn't do it perfectly, there are still some commands that are not supported by the software. But, it does it well enough that you don't feel too bad for not having spent $5,000 to set up a home lab. I think this would be a great tool for a business to buy for a budding router config specialist. After all, learning on this thing is a lot safer than learning on your company's real routers."
4,Sybex CCNA Router Sim will help,"I am a Networking Instructor, we just bought $60,000 of Cisco equipment to setup our lab for the students to practice on . I also got a copy of the Sybex CCNA Router sim, it does have several errors as noted above . . . but for less then $89 it is perfect for the students to practice with and get the feel of the routers/switches at home. It is all about study and practice. Some of my students have never seen a router - this will help ! I rated 4 stars(leave room for Sybex to improve) because for the price - you can not go wrong."
2,"Nice, but I found online labs CHEAPER and BETTER.","No question, this lab sim is good and provides a nice topology to work with.BUT, for the coin you have to spend, you may find a better way to go. Check out IPExpert.com. They provide a free CCNA workbook with about 20 labs in it. Then check out www.gettLabs.com. They provide a FREE rack to work through the IPExpert labs. For no money, you can work with REAL equipment. Read the gettLabs Support forums before you start. There is a lot of helpful infomation for CCNA people using their equipment.I liked Sybex, but it is just too hard to justify the cost."
1,waste of money,"this product is outdated and dangerous can give you wrong ideas, i would suggest that you spend you money on buying real eqipment on ebay."
2,"Great idea, poor execution","While the idea of a virtual router is a good one, this bit of software has been very disappointing. My first issue is with the number of commands available - there aren't enough. And there should be a different response for unsupported ones, so the user knows if he/she has made an error or simply exceeded the scope of the trainer. More importantly, though, is the ""bugginess"" of the software. Commands don't ""take"", or they show as configured but then don't perform as they should. I have done a ""ping"", had it fail, and then immediately repeat it and had it succeed. The basic commands are better, but access lists and WAN configurations are very poorly done. Needs work. The companion book, on the other hand, is very good."
3,More to be desired,"I did not by Todd Lammle's book. Fortunately, or unfortunately, I purchased another book for study before I realized I would need access to routers to pass this test. Unable to afford real routers I purchased through Amazon this product hoping to get the experience I needed to pass the CCNA test. The book I use assumes I have access to a real router. When I try the commands about 25% of them fail using this simulator.This product may get me through the CCNA exam, but it ain't simulating the real thing."
3,Blend of a classic western adventure and a more modern 'problem' YA novel,"In a Western town whose survival hangs on buffalo hunts, two brothers who control the hunting grounds are the unofficial government. When they kidnap a prisoner from a federal marshall, the only one willing to help the lawman is a teenager with a grudge. Pike, embittered by the stigma attached to him because of his drunken father, is eager to humiliate and harass the town by assisting the unwelcome marshal, even if it means risking his own neck.A little slow in parts, but ultimately satisfying with appealing characters and not too heavyhanded on the 'problem' aspect."
4,IT WAS EXTREMLY DETAILED AND REALALISTIC,"THE BOOK WAS VERY INTERESTING KIND OF KEPT YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOU SEAT. I THOUGHT THAT THE PLOT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFERENT FROM ALL OF THE OTHER BOOKS THOUGH. I MEAN IF YOU KEEP WRITING ABOUT GIRLS GOING FROM POOR TO RICH IT WILL GET A LITTLE BORING IN THE END, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SO PREDICTABLE. I GUESS IT WAS ABOUT AN 8 EVEN THOUGH THE PLOT WAS MORE OR LESS REPEATING FROM MOST OF THE OTHER BOOKS."
5,BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN,"I love the Heaven series. It is very thought provoking, and it lingers on your mind. I think this is her second best novel, its excellence is only preceded by Dawn. The pure passion V.C. Andrews puts into her tale of a poor mountain girl who is torn from her life and her family, is surreal. This is a book I would reccommend to anyone who loves tremendous literature."
2,Not as advertised,"This is the book I ordered but I ordered the large print version and this was not a large print book. My mother enjoyed reading it, but unfortunately I will not be able to."
1,Rubbish,"I suspect Flower's in the Attic was a lucky one-off. The rest of that particular series gradually worsened with each book. The 'Heaven' series is total trash. Tacky, trashy, and totally superficial. The name 'Heaven Leigh' makes me laugh, but is a good indicator of the dreamy storyline. It contains an absolutely unrealistic plot full of cardboard-cut-out characters. This C-grade 'soapie' is nothing more than a pathetic 'rags-to-riches' fantasy. It's full of 'beautiful' women with perfect figures and faces that 'ignite arousal' in any man. And 'dashing' men who are 'handsome', 'dangerous', and 'mysterious'. If you like your characters shallow and romantacised with no hints of reality or complexity than you'll enjoy the characters in these books. It contains as much depth as a puddle and is boring and predictable. Quite frankly, I'm embarrassed to have the series in my bookshelf but am not so cruel as to give them away to poor, unsuspecting victims."
3,not in very good condition,"I just received this book today, and it was shipped very quick, thank you for that. But the book was described as being in ""very good condition"", it is not. The book is very used. I would describe it in acceptable or good condition not very good. This is a disappointment since it was a birthday present for my sister. I just wish it was described correctly then i would have bought a more better one."
5,Outstanding,This is the best book i've ever read...it just captures your heart. As i was reading I could feel everything Heaven felt...you could just invision it all...be right there with her...Heaven is by far the best book in the Andrews collection
5,This Book Is Worth Reading!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is so cool!! I didn't read a V.C. Andrews book until this one and it made me want to read her other ""Works Of Art""!! This book would probly appeal mostly to teenagers!! So parts of this book were very emotional for me, a girl of 15 years. I've been trying to read all books in this series but having trouble finding the thrid book ""Fallen Hearts"", until now I see that I can Get it here!! I think anyonw would find this book is totally worth the time to sit back and read!! It's just like you are there with Heaven along here tough journey!!"
4,"""Heaven""......With The Ups and Downs","I do have to admit ""Heaven"" was a pretty good book. However, it was not my favorite. The book is written with the characters speaking in a country accent and I do not like to read that particular type of literature. Yet, the content was very good and I was shocked when such a loving family actually sold their children. I admire the ambitions of Heaven, the main character in the book, and did enjoy the way the book ended. I thought it was very beneficial for Heaven to break through her bad family name. But, I enjoyed the New series of the Cutler family more. ""Heaven"" just had no comparison to ""Dawn."" I would not recommend this book to anyone who does not just simply love books written by V.C. Andrews."
5,FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY AND STINGS LIKE A BEE,"The Casteel saga was my favorite out of all the novels that V.C. Andrews wrote. Everything that Heaven did was something that I understood, but it hurt me so much when she couldn't forgive Luke. He wasn't the best father, but selling her to the horrible Kitty was one of the best choices he've made. She suffered there, but at least she didn't have to worry about starving. Her romance with Logan was the sweetest, and when Cal started taking advantage of her I was ready to pounce. Grr! This is a great book though. V.C. Andrews wrote this book herself, and if you enjoy her original works you will love this."
5,Great book,I love the series I have read it three times and I will probably read it three more times. It keeps you in suspense all the way through.
5,HEAVEN HELD MY ATTENTION LIKE NO OTHER NOVEL,"I HAVE READ MANY V.C. ANDREWS BOOKS SINCE THE TIME I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD. BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE INTRIGUED AND FASINATED ME LIKE HEAVEN HAS. THE WAY THE WILLIES IS DESCRIBED THE PAIN AND THE HUNGER THE FAMILY WENT THROUGH CAN ACTUALLY PUT ME THERE IN MY IMMAGINATION. HEAVENS LIFE THROUGHOUT THE SERIES OF BOOKS IS ONE OF MANY STRUGGLES THAT ONE CAN HOPE FOR HER TO ACCOMPLISH. HEAVEN WAS THE FIRST V.C. ANDREWS BOOK THAT I HAD EVER READ AND I LOVED IT SO MUCH I JUST HAD TO READ MORE AND MORE OF HER NOVELS. NOW 27 YEARS OLD AND 4 WORN OUT HEAVEN BOOKS LATER I DECIDED TO NAME MY LAST DAUGHTER HEAVEN, AND I OFTEN WONDER IF MS. ANDREWS KNOWS WHAT AN EFFECT HER BOOK HAS ON PEOPLE TO MOVE THEM IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO NAME A CHILD AFTER A BOOK COVER. JUST TO LET HER KNOW IF SHE WERE TO EVER READ THIS THAT I LOVE HER AND HER WORK AND WILL ALWAYS ENJOY READING HER NOVELS. THANK YOU"
5,The Best!,"I have never read such wonderful books before! V.C.Andrews is a great author! I think that Heaven was one of her best books. I love the content of all her books. I did a book report on one of them, and I couldn't stop talking about how wonderful the books are. Heaven shows the hardships in an abnormal life, without her really knowing what a normal life is. I felt like I was there throught the whole book, and he problems made me think about life. Heaven's problems were just so scary it made me think about mine. V.C. Andrews must be the best writer of all time! I have read 2/3 of her books, and most of them 3 times! I could never get tired of them, and the Casteel series is my favorite!"
4,suitable for teenagers,"I was first introduced to V.C. Andrews about 7 years ago when I was in 7th grade. Although I think that ""Flowers In The Attic"" was really Andrews' breakthrough, ""Heaven"" is a novel that is more suitable for pre-teens and teenagers.The novel reads easily but this does not weaken the moving story. Heaven, the main character, is followed by the audience as she grows up and struggles the cruelties of life. Despite the fact that most readers will not find their own lives analogous to Heaven's, this book is still the perfect coming-of-age novel, emphasizing the importance of facing problems head on and being able to find goodness in dark places."
5,Heavenly!!,"I loved this book! I thought it was an excellent move from the whole ""Flowers In The Attic"" novels... It was great... It's about this family who are basically hillbillies, who are poor, and the story revolves around the daughter Heaven, who promises she'll find her dead mother's parents, and make a life she can be proud of... such tragedy ahead, tears, & Abuse... It's a wonderfully written story... I recommend it, definetly..."
4,"Love VC, dislike kindle version","I absolutely adore this BOOK--as in the paperback I had years ago. The kindle version was poorly transferred, and included 20+ errors. Being a stickler for grammar, punctuation, and spelling, this flaw became extremely distracting from the awesomeness that is Heaven."
5,Excellent.,"I couldn't put this book down. I'm a huge fan of Andrews but I think this is quite possibly her best. It reads so smoothly, never dull, so you breeze through it. Can't wait to continue on in this series!"
3,BEWARE,"The songs on this CD are great, if you can get it to play on your CD player. I have found out that these CD's are encoded with some sort of technology which does not allow it to be played on certain CD players. Nor could I play it on my computer. I had to resort to playing it on my DVD player."
5,The Kentucky Encyclopedia,"The Kentucky Encyclopedia is a premier reference on Kentucky, both past and present. Entertaining as well, every page seems to include a rare bit of trivia."
4,Shark Slippers,I liked them. They were big enough for my friends feet and he has like size 12 feet in mens. so the point that I got some that fit are awesome.
5,Adorable!,I got these for my sister and she was so happy to have them. She says they're comfy and fun.
1,slow reading,"if you like lengthy trial transcript, you might beable to understand and enjoy a book like this one. A good crime book grabs me from page one and doesn't let me go until I've finished it. This one has little detail of the lives surrounding the circumstance, and reads very slow from start to finish."
5,The complex relationship between student and teacher,"A friend who teaches European lit asked me if I didn't think Stefan Zweig was ""sentimental."" But in the case of ""Confusion,"" all the high emotion fits the story of a rather obsessive-compulsive young man, who is rather disinterested in learning until he meets the right teacher. Framed by the perspective of this same young man as a 60-year-old professor, the tale is even more poignant. This tale of an over-eager student, who can't see that he's behaving like a spurned lover when his teacher criticizes him, is a searing psychological study. Considering that Zweig gave the eulogy at Freud's funeral, who better to explore such things? I've never read a work by Zweig I didn't find richly textured, beautifully written, and deeply felt. If that's ""sentimental,"" then I plead guilty!"
2,Not surprising,"This short novel tells the story of a student who gets entangled in confusing sentiments between his professor, the professor's wife and himself.Although the different players are well characterized, the plot is too evident and the final revelation not surprising.This is not one of Stefan Zweig's most successful stories."
2,Lack Quality,"The quality of of this dvd was poor, it paused several times in the beginning, but finally got on track after about 5 minutes into the movie. I do not believe I will be making future purchases from this company."
1,TERRIBLE!,Terrible! I wish I could return it for a deferent movie. This is the first really bad movie I have ever received from Amazon.Acting was awful
3,It wasn't that bad!!!,"This movie is okay...Not great, but not bad either. If you are a jaded person, you may not be able to get it (or want to). This movie requires you to have some faith in love and humanity. Wood Harris is an up and coming actor...Not your ""traditional"" leading male. Lisa Raye is beautiful, and plays the role of conniving diva very well. This movie has 'umph'...an intangible lure that keeps you watching. This makes up for much of the rigidness of the filmmaking...All in all, worth the watch."
3,Everyday Life,Just a true love triangle. It just shows how a person let fame go to their heads and how sometimes it isn't all about the fame. This can cause you to lose those who truly love and support you.
5,Great Book!,"Father Kleba truly captured my imagination by portraying the Holy Family in the realistic setting of their everyday lives. Most enjoyable reading!Linda Finney Hillsboro, MO"
3,Funny to the right audience.,Read the title. It is vulgar. Saw him on late night and wanted to see more. Its freezing in here will get stuck in every guys head. SO true.
2,Not funny,"Maybe I am too old fashioned, but this routine was not very funny at all. This one will be the first dvd on my sale table. And I am Black, so it had to be horrible."
1,Maybe not funny,"A black comedian with only 3 reviews might not be very funny. Also, why is this DVD not on Netflix yet?"
5,Helpful Book for My Eighth Grader,This book is used in my son's middle school. He asked me to purchase it so that he can use it to do his homework. He found this book very helpful. I have purchased two more Science Explorer books (Inside Earth and Weather and Climate). He has found all of these titles helpful.It is always a good thing if the dad buys a book and the kid actually uses it and finds it helpful!
3,Very specific travel type,"This book is decent, has some good tips (like which places you can get tickets in advance, like Neuschwanstein). Only bought in because several coworkers recommended it...otherwise would've just bought a different one. It's great if your tastes match Mr Steves', but if not it won't do you too much good.The first and worst assumption is that if you're going to Germany or Austria, you will of course be visiting the other. Another assumption is that you will not wish to use train very much at all...Europe is famous for having a thorough public transportation system, and not taking advantage of it seems to me like missing out on part of the experience of being in those countries.The book does have its moments though, and gives very thorough information about each of the areas and activities it mentions. It's definitely worth a peek if you're not sure where you want to visit."
3,Rick picked Rothenburg over Heidelberg?????,"You must be joking, Rick! He said that Heidelberg, with its magnificant castle and breathtaking scenery isn't worth a look, yet he blathers on and on about Rothenburg, which is a HUGE tourist trap. I lived in Europe for 15 years, traveled extensively, and Rothenburg was absolutely the most crowded, tourist-ridden site I visited!!Rick must be getting old. Time to retire, dude."
3,"CLAMPS HARD TO USE, REWIND FEATURE IS NICE","This hair setter is at a par for other setters. It's not any better than my 25 year old Clairol setter, except for the cord rewind feature, which I love.My Clairol has wire clips which I don't like. I like the large plastic clips. This one doesn't come with either, it comes with these hard to open long spring clamps that are hard to use.It's a shame because it was a nice looking setter with a cord rewinder, but too expensive anyway."
5,My hair and I love it =),"I bought this to save my fine hair from other more damaging styling tools that make it hard for me to grow my hair out. I use a low heat setting, the curls last all day, and it does seem gentler on my hair than my curling iron. I like them much better than the heated rollers I used as a teen long, long ago!"
4,Soft silky curls,My daughters and i love these. They get pretty hot though. The curls seem to last all day.
1,Who designed this?,"This is a very poorly designed product, especially considering it is far more expensive than most sets I have bought before. The clips that hold the curlers in place are huge, there is no where convenient to put them like the small metal ones. They are heavy and feel clumsy on my head. There is no where nice to grab the curlers so I burn my fingers sometimes. I guess it heats up fine, but they are so difficult to deal with that I have yet to get a nice curl."
4,Hair Shaper,My wife loves her Conair Ceramic Hair Roller. No more water! The only thing she didn't like was the tight fit to the head of the rollers. That's why 4 in lieu of 5 stars.
1,very disappointed,"I ordered the white version of these in early Sept. They arrived in black. I sent them back and reordered the white. I had them for less than 8 months and only used them about twice a week. They stopped heating up in early May.Hot rollers aren't much good if they won't heat up. I've purchased several Conair rollers sets over the years and each time they break earlier and earlier. If they didn't work so well with my hair I wouldn't have kept trying. But never again. I'm going to try to find some that hold the curl , don't get tangled or leave marks and stay functional for a reasonable length of time."
1,Rollers don't work,"These rollers fall out of my hair within minutes...even those that stay in, they don't curl my hair. I would definitely not buy this and will return it now."
3,Not my best choice,"Amazon followed through with their responsibility with this product; however, the manufacturer's product description was flawed. The roller clips doesn't hold the hair in place. The container is big and bulky. The rollers fail to curl my hair evenly."
5,Just what I've been looking for!,"I was unable to find this ""gem"" in retail stores, so I went online. Found it at several sites, but have always found Amazon to be reliable & extremely prompt. This time was no exception. This hair setter allows me to choose from 12 heat settings, the retractable cord is a great addition, and 20 rollers in a variety of sizes make this product the best for my needs. The clips are worthless, but I have a good collection of wire ones from previous setters."
3,Disappointing,"The enormously talented Frank Capra can't do screwball comedy in my opinion. This film along with ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" and ""Pocketful of Miracles"" fail at various levels. (I'm almost certain I read that Cary Grant thought ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" was over directed). The actors in these films seem too aware that they are in this genre. It's as if they are following techniques of ""Screwball Comedy Acting 101."" Edward Arnold, and James Stewart are always first rate. Aside from the excellent restaurant sequence with Stewart and Jean Arthur, the film is artificial. I don't take the Academy Awards seriously, but, for this film to win best picture is really puzzling to me.It's not terrible like ""Arsenic"" or ""Miracles"" but it's not what I expected."
1,It tries too hard to be funny.,I love the original stage play. And I love the tv version which stars Jason Robards. Both of these versions are well written and very funny. But the Frank Capra version just tries too hard to be funny and ultimately falls flat. And they changed the stage play beyond belief. Jimmy Stewart's character was built up and the other characters were cut back. The continuity of the story suffered because of that. But the worst aspect of the movie is the overblown effort of all involved to be oh so funny and zany and madcap. It is terribly overdone. I usually like Jimmy Stewart's acting. But not in this movie. I usually like Frank Capra's movies. But not this one.
4,Overdone version of a great play.,"Although a very nicely done capra film, this version is too similar to Its a Wonderful Life.I would recommend the 1992 PBS version with Jason Robards."
2,Big Business against the people,"I give this movie two stars because it is a good movie. Why I don't give a higher rating is the theme. The theme is ""big business is bad and we have all these sweet wonderful people who are the victims"". Hollywood hasn't changed much over the years. The movie even celebrates the Russian revolution. I guess Jimmy Stewart did this during his socialist phase."
4,"An old movie, that makes a good point, although a bit exaggerated","This movie is instructive in these days, where individual or corporate greed takes over the natural concerns for fellow human beings, co-existence with mutual dependences and above all the source of happiness. People clamor for happiness in life and seek for it in things that they can do to outwit another. This film shows a rich man's reckless expansion of his business by uprooting poor people that live adjacent to his building and finally how he comes to terms with reality, when his own son breaks off from him. It is an old black and white movie - but is very refreshing to watch again these days."
5,great video,The audio and video quality was great. This is a classic film-Jimmy Stewart before he stars in Its a Wonderful Life as well as a number of other actors who appear in Its A Wonderful Life but play very different characters in this film and they do so very well.
5,You really can not!,"This is a hilarious Frank Capra film. Comedy, deep thought, romance, charm. Perfect for family viewing if you are looking for laugh out loud story."
4,Taking it with you...,A very well done adaptation from the play by the same name and of great assistance to us in our stage production.
2,the movie is wonderful but not the DVD,"I think this movie is much better than It's a Wonderful Life which gets more press. The characters are loveably zany and an ensemble of great actors play them. However, the DVD is a real disappointment. It is advertised as 'digitally remastered' and HiDef quality which it is. BUT EVERY SCRATCH AND DING in the master has been lovingly 'remastered' along with it. I am amazed that they didn't clean up the movie. Movies half the price - like His Girl Friday done by LaserDisc - are absolutely clear and clean as well. This classic deserves a better effort than this so jeers to the company, whoever they are. I'm selling this one and waiting for a better attempt, thank you very much. Buy it only if you haven't seen the movie."
2,Not as good of a movie as you might think.,"A Frank Capra film, with a cast of Jimmy Stewart and Lionel Barrymore? How could a movie like this go wrong? Well, you might be surprised.I watched You Can't Take It With You on one of our family nights in our den. We popped the movie in, and figured on enjoying an evening of cinematic enjoyment comparable to It's A Wonderful Life. By the end of the movie, my opinion had changed.Basically, besides the love story between Stewart's character, which is almost a side plot, the movie is about a pack of pirates who don't do anything...they just stay at home and lie around! Jimmy Stewart is pretty much the only thing that held this movie together for me, and the only reason that I finished the movie is that I hate to leave a movie started, but not finished.Watch this movie only if you have some time, and can stand to be a little bored, or if you, like me, hadn't ever seen Lionel Barrymore in a movie as a GOOD guy."
2,You can't take it with you.....,"You Can't Take It with You (Remastered)I thought that as this was a remastered edition that it would be IN COLOR! It isn't. That's disappointin because it didn't clearly indicate on the site that it wasn't in color, but in fact, black and white.We wanted a colorized version. Look at the picture on the site- COLOR!"
1,WASTE OF TIME!,I had recently done the orginal stage play of this and a few of us csat members decided to rent the movie. It was turned off in about 10 minites. The movie is nothing like the play. In my opinion the play is way better.
4,"Great laughs, especially toward the end...","This prize-winning play about a nutty family of eccentrics in the 1930's isn't done on stage much anymore (it is a nightmare to produce properly with typical community theater casts and budgets, and it's dated a lot), but the film version, nearly 70 years old now, is worth seeing. Just as good, but apparently not on DVD yet, is a stage version from about 15 years ago starring Jason Robards. I used to own the video tape of that one, and it was quite well done. However, it's hard to beat Jean Arthur and Jimmy Stewart and Lionel Barrymore, for Pete's sake. As an example of '30's-style comic playwriting and movie-making, you can take ""You Can't Take it with You"" with you, if you buy this."
2,bloated Capra-corn,"Capra turned a delightful Broadway play into a bloated piece of Capra-corn. I'm not berating the film for not copying the play. I am berating the film for being heavy handed and neither particularly amusing or touching. [Spoiler] To the whimsical story of the Sycamore family Capra has grafted a story about an megalomaniacal businessman who drives his competitor to death. The two stories don't mix. Even Jean Arthur and the rest of the talented cast can't save this film. Hard to understand how it won two Academy Awards. But then again other turkeys such as ""Cavalcade"" and ""Greatest Show on Earth"" also won Best Picture."
3,'It's a Wonderful Life: The Prequel',"Not a huge Capra fan, too preachy (except for 'It Happened One Night'. Hilarious, with no moral). It's an OK movie. I watched it due to a friend's recommendation. The wakcy characters really aren't that wacky, and as it goes along you wonder how do these people survive from day to day? Grandpa (Lionel Barrymore) says he evaluates stamp collections, but does philately really pay that much? As for the ending, Capra used it again, along with a lot of the cast, 8 years later in IAWL."
5,Very good movie,It was a very entertaining movie and their was a lot to learn from it.The movie displayed love and family and how to live with people by being fair to everyone in life.
5,One of my faverites,I love this movie . It's a wonderful story and just a joy to watch . An eccentric family and the way they change others . I have an older copy and I love watching it . It is my faverite Frank Capra movie .
1,RIP OFF!,"SHAME, SHAME, SHAME!!! How could such a wonderful film receive such an awful transfer? Even more unbelievable is how can anybody charge Criterion Collection prices for a film with no restoration? Answer: RIP OFF!"
4,CASINO BLITZ!,"I love the Las Vegas casinos. Any book that has to do with night life, I'll read. It's a wonderful book. Easy reading to go along with it. No vulgar language. It's ultimately a ""train"" read or ""beach"" read. Sorry I finished it. T."
5,Great New Author,"Hey, this book was pretty good. If I can't put it down, then I know it's a winner. Saw Gambino at a book signing in New York and bought her book. Glad I did. ...."
4,Coming Home,"This book gives a lot of information about Josh Gibson, if you never heard of him. In the book, a grandfather tells his grandson about Josh Gibson, and about witnessing a famous home run Josh hit in Yankee Stadium.I recommend this book to learn about the best home run hitter of the Negro Leagues, and maybe of all of Major League Baseball."
1,cheap and worthless,"I bought two of these locks for an overseas trip. Within a week, BOTH had jammed open and wouldn't close. I praise Amazon for taking them back after the 30-day return period, as I was overseas."
3,Falls Short Of The Glory,"I must warn you up front: tracks 2,10,11,15,16,17 and 18 are ALTERNATE TAKES, not the masters you are probably use to. And it is NOT advertised on the package! So if you know these songs by heart, you will either be pleased to have them or very annoyed. Just to warn you.The transfers are fine but the song selection is missing a bunch of songs that I would consider essential to a ""Very Best"" collection of Benny's RCA period. It is just not one without ""Don't Be That Way"", ""Loch Lomond"", ""Goodnight My Love"", ""Goodbye"", ""Down South Camp Meeting"", ""Changes"" and ""Body & Soul"". I would say go with ""Pure Gold"" or ""Sing, Sing, Sing"" instead."
1,Bad press fitting on Hose,"I install the return hose for the power steering and at first it was working properly, but after driving the vehicle for 25 minutes I had lost of power steering and fluid leaking. What happen was the pressed fitting from the manufacturer gave (hose to metal tubing) and caused a big time fluid lost and the engine was cover with the fluid. This could of been a very dangerous driving situation but I was able to park and had tools and clamps to repair the assembly after removal and reinstall as a modified assembly with new fluid. This was a close call. I had expected better quality from a major hose manufacturer and seller.Sincerely a very unhappy customer."
5,"Adds an extra 18"" to the basket..","Easy to install, fits in the center section and extends your M.O.A.B. basket another foot and a half in the middle to fill out the roof and add cargo area."
5,Excellent,"This book got me through my internal medicine final exam in a way that Ettinger never would. What's more, it got me through my first year in small animal practice as well. Ettinger is fine if you want to look up details on obscure diseases, but like other reviewers have already written, I agree that this is the book you need for the real world. It's user friendly, easy to read, and with great illustrations. After a few years in small animal practice you might want to get Ettinger as well, but start out with this one. You won't regret it. The neurology section could've been more comprehensive, though."
2,Don't buy the ebook,"I find the book lacking in detail I've become accustomed to in Ettinger. I primarily purchased it to use on my iPad, however I am very disappointed with the ebook quality. It takes minimal advantage of the ebook format -hyperlinks are used minimally - for example in the Chapter Outlines at the beginn of each chapter you cannot jump to the subchapters, rather you must go page by page. This is very frustrating and should be one of the distinct advantages of an ebook over paper.Unfortunately the ebook Ettinger did not get a good review either.I will probably write this off and go back to my hard copy Ettinger. The ebook environment for medical or scientific texts is still in its infancy so beware!"
4,Outstanding text,"This allows me to carry this text in a much lighter (weightwise) format. Drs. Nelson and Couto are the tops in their fields, and have edited an outstanding book that is necessary in any veterinarian's library. The only knock I have on the kindle version, is the same knock on every kindle medical text I have seen so far. Many times, looking for a topic is not as quick as it is when you are actually holding the real book. Yes, you can get to the index easy enough, but you have to page through the index one page at a time to get to the topic you want. That's ok if you are looking at an auto-immune diseases, not so good if you are looking for stomatitis."
5,great resource,"I have returned to practise after a really long break. I have found this text a fantastic resource in helping me restore and build my knowledge base. It is so readable - how many texts could you imagine reading while you eat your breakfast! - with facts, opinion and local user knowledge supplemented by practical tables and diagrams. For every-day veterinary medicine I doubt that there is a better text."
4,Great book.,A little technical so best for vet or prospective vet students. Overall very informative.
1,These are 2008!,These are 2008 forms as descibed in the other review. We've asked for a refund. This is a complete waste of everyone's time.
1,This TV lasted just 3 months,"The picture quality was great, and I had the TV conveniently mounted on the wall and was quite happy with it. Suddenly, the LCD screen developed black spots and then went black completely, indicating the LCD screen was either defective or the TV itself was of poor quality. I've had friends whose Sylvania televisions also go dead after a few months, so this is the last time I buy anything from Sylvania. My advice: stick with brands that are known for reliability like Sony. You may have to spend a few dollars more, but in my example, it would be worth the extra bucks."
3,"Would have worked, but I was sent the wrong filter.","Fram is great stuff, but I should have gotten the code PH6018. I was sent a PH6016 which did not fit. I found out when I went to perfrom the oil change. Thankfully, the local auto parts store had ONE on the shelf that did fit."
4,"Does the job, slightly outdated","This book will come in handy for anyone attemting to write in a way that avoids gender-specific terms when both males and females are being discussed. It has a quite thorough list of words that have a gender specific background or meaning and gives neutral substitute terms. Although not all would object to the usage of terms whose gender sppecitivity is so hidden that one needs a lexicographer to see it, the authors give alternatives for all words that carry a gender bias. It is a bit outdated but I have found it to be very helpful."
1,Westlife: The Performance You Want To Miss,"I had previously purchased all the other available Weastlife DVDs and was thrilled with the results. I ordered this DVD especially because the concert featured songs from their earlier albums which tend to get less coverage on other concert footage. This was their first DVD attempt & boy does it show! The concert itself is a bit cheesy, but the most disappointing thing for me was that Mark had terrible pitch problems throughout. He hardly ever sang in tune having particular trouble with all the high notes. If you want to see Westlife in concert and enjoy it don't buy this DVD. However, Coast To Coast (for great unplugged performances), The Number Ones Tour and Westlife Live at Wembley especially, are much better investments. You can really see how much the boys have matured and have much more stage presence and confidence in these DVD performances compared to the amateur quality of Where Dreams Come True."
5,Dreams do really come true!!,"This DVD was a beautiful blast from the past! It was Westlife's first tour, but their excellence radiated through out their performances! These Irish lads are so funny and fans get to see former member, Bryan McFadden at his quirkiest! There are a lot of behind the scenes parts of the DVD which were highly enjoyable, the costumes scream early 2000's - it was just a pleasure to watch!Songs that are overlooked on other tours like, ""Seasons of the sun"" and ""I Lay my love on you"" are covered very well. This DVD is a definate collectable for true westlife fans!"
4,Amazing and Wonderful,"In the book Dovey Coe, Dovey's older sister falls into the likes the richest, meanest man in town,Parnell. Dovey doesn't like this man so when she is found in the same room as Parrnell's dead body she is convicted of murder.I liked how the author made the reader think that Parnell was scummy, For making rude Remarks about Amos. I also liked that the Aurthur mentioned the knife when Dovey bought it before she used it on Parnell.This is a great novel Full of excitement and a pinch of mystery. Once reading you won't be able to stop. And trust me the ending will shock you."
5,My 5th graders and I love this book!,"Dovey is an irresistible character who you love and root for. Great to teach the inequality of social economic class in America. My kids loved reading it aloud with a mountain accent. Oh, did they dislike Parnell. I hightly recommend this read. Each year I find a girl in my class that has a bit of Dovey's spirit in her."
5,The Hook Book,A reader that would like to read this book is a reader that likes mysteries and that likes a little humor because Dovey is quite funny. This reader would want to like to be hooked onto books because at the beginning and end of every chapter there is a great hook. The protagonist is my personal favorite because she makes me laugh and is very serious throughout the book. I think the book was humorus in some places but most of the time the parts in the book were very serious and very active.
4,Dovey Coe,"I picked up this book thinking it would be more of a western novel, but after the first few pages I knew I was obligated to read it. Dovey had a very strong character and really expressed her opinion on every little detail. The court case is what interested me the most, when the suggestion of her murdering Parnell was being tossed around the court room. This is a GREAT book and I reccomend it."
4,A proper beginning,"I like this book.The relation between the characters is simple but some interesting. Although there is not much mystery in this story, I still think the plot is fine. I am a mystery fan, but I would not evaluate this one with the strict level. I just think this is a very good book for my children to begin reading mystery.The scene on the court will be cool to a child. The description of Dovey's thinking is very interesting. That's a very good climax."
5,A Fearless Girl,"This novel is about a young girl going through life with a deaf brother and a gorgeous sister. Caroline, her sister, is asked to to take Parnell Caraway's hand, a snotty well known rich boy who gets everything he wants. Dovey hates Parnell and would be mortified if her sister were to marry him. So when Parnell winds up dead, Dovey is everyones first suspect. Dovey fights for her rights and shows everyone that she is not afraid to stand up for herself. Reading this book, you'll have some laughs, crys, and surprises. This is a novel you're sure to love."
5,Excelent smooth and stress free transaction,"The book looked like it was brand new it was in awesome condition, the shipping was fast and the deal went very smoothly. Nice when there is enough stress out there to be able to do a quick clean no drama deal with a professional."
1,Unrealistic Portrayal,"What ruined this book for me was the way Dovey's brother, Amos, was portrayed. It is not likely that a child who is deaf and has never had any formal schooling would be able to lip read as well as he does, let alone be able to read Mark Twain. Many children who are deaf and have gone to school all their lives wouldn't be able to read at that level. I had trouble believing in the plot knowing this."
4,The Unknown Murder,"Dovey Coe by Frances O'Roark it is a mystery about a murder, but I can't tell you who. It's a mystery that will pull you in and get you hooked. In the beginning, Dovey says she didn't kill Parnell, but she hated him as much as the next. One reason Dovey hated Parnell was because Parnell liked her sister, Caroline, and, wouln't stop begging her to marry him. Then... You'll have to read the rest of the book to find out what happens next.by Kevin and Matt in Corning,Arkansas"
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed by this book, despite the wonderful jacket. I expected to feel close to Dovey Coe, to understand her from the inside out. Instead I found the narration distancing, and I never really got caught up in her story. There are other great books for children that also have a strong voice, but that are somehow truer in their emotional portrayal of their charismatic, spunky narrators."
4,book,My wife loaned her library book to someone and they failed to return it. Was glad I could find a replacement copy cheaper than libray charges.
1,Dovey Coe is no Scout,"I found this book oddly flat and was disappointed by the ending, which I found hard to believe and to a certain extent, ridiculous. While this has its strong points, particularly the writing and in the development of characters, I felt the story needed more substance. To compare it (on the flaps!) to TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a shame. There are far better books available for young readers than this."
3,A well written book,The book Dovey Coe is a well written book. Dovey Coe is a 12 year old girl in the small town of Indian Creek. It's hard when your sister is the most beautiful girl in town. It's even harder when there is a stuck up rich boy in love with her named Parnell. Parnell and Dovey get in a fight and Dovey's blamed for the murder. Will Dovey win the case?This book is written by Frances Dowell. You are able to get inside the mind of Dovey. The only thing I didn't like was it wasn't much of a mystery. I give it 3 stars.
5,Spectacular,Dovey Coe is a story that touched my heart because of its seemingly amazing characters. The author made descriptions that could flow like the ocean. I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading and even if they don't I think they should give it a shot.
3,It was okay..............,"I Didn't think this was much of a mystery book. I mean, the murder took place at the end of the story. It was mostly just some girl ranting on about how much she hated parnell caraway.I gave this book three stars because 1. It wasn't much of a mystery and 2.It wasn't that hard to figure out.It lacked something.(warning:This book may cause grammar problems. It had me saying ""I reckon"" for weeks afterword.)"
5,Dovey Coe,"I really like the book, I recommend it to anyone. I really think Dovey is a great character she speaks her mind. The book is about a young girl that is accused of killing Parnell Caraway a rich stuck-up boy that was in love with Caroline, Dovey's beautiful older sister. I really liked this book."
4,exquisite and deliciously complex,"One of the reasons why i'm a true alanis fan is that i relate to her on different levels. I love the fact she's a complex human being, (not to mention a truly gifted musician)and the way she writes her thoughts are truly poetic. Her true fans understand what i'm saying. She's a unique individual. I hope to hear her music for a zillion years to come."
1,"Bad, boreing, failed high concept","BAD, BAD, BAD!!1. First FOURTY FIVE MINUTES of film is a chick running across a desert.2. Movie is THREE FOURTHS NARIATION. What little dialogue there is is pathetic.3. Tries to work a high concept into the last 20 minutes and blows it completely.A boreing waist of time and money. BAD!"
5,Eye opener,"I used this video in my sophomore World History class when we were studying the beginnings of sea trade in the 1500s. This film was a major eye opener for my kids, as well as a vehicle allowing me to learn a few new things. Most of my students knew little or nothing about where and how the slave trade began, let alone the ""contribution"" made to this hideous practice by those who would become our nations forbears. They do now.This film gave us a lot to talk about and was truly both an eye opener and a paradigm shifter. An excellent film in content, both historically and cinematically. I highly recommend this to any audience with a maturity level to handle the extreme emotion evoked by the suffering and heartache laid bare on the screen. Parents and teachers - be ready to discuss some hard truths with your kids. Excellently done!"
3,"Not good for middle school students, better for high school","Even though this is presented as the story of a slave, it's not really set up with a plot, characters etc. My students found it hard to follow because it is lacking typical narrative elements - and it is presented more like a philosophical & reflective journey. The excessive voice-over narration and advanced vocabulary were also confusing for the students. It did not keep the student's attention. I think this is film is better suited for older students."
1,just as bad as their other products,"This is a product fully deserving of *zero* stars if Amazon had their rating system set up to give that score...cheaply done, cheaply made...do NOT waste money on this thing. I'll never buy anything else produced by the makers of this product. Ever."
3,Good introduction to Baja diving,"This book describes many of the major diving areas in Baja. Unfortunately, it really doesn't get specific about many of the dive sites. It's a good introduction, and will help you ask informative questions, but if you are looking at diving sites on your own, this book falls short. The book gives a nice overview of Baja topside and also contains a nice marine life identification section. If you are trying to get an idea of where you'd like to go and what you can expect to see, this book fits the bill...."
4,"Backward time isn't such a new thing, it will start long ago","the author explores the popular concept of time travel from an optimistic however skeptical view of a quantum physicist. with the bizarre predictions of quantum theory and relativity, anything can happen (and will acording to feynman). read this book and enjoy a topic interesting from any perspective."
4,G= - n cubed,A great book that gives insight to new visual data from Hubble and other satillites. My personal view is that gravity is a negative constant. Which helps the author's theories about worm-holes. Proof and testing of his theories are still 1000 years away.
2,Kit Carson historical fiction,Carson was an interesting man in American history. It's too bad this story of his life as a trapper and guide wasn't.
4,Taking photos with a digital camera,"Love this book! I have been listing on eBay for a couple of years and am always looking to improve my photos. This book is written in simple language with clear instructions, I can reccommend it to anyone who wishes to begin taking digital photos or improve their photos."
3,OK at best,"As a some time seller on eBay I've come to realize that my photos are as important, if not more impotant than my auction description. I guess the reason I'm not as enamoured with this book than the other reviewers of this book is that right off the top you are told not to read through this book, but to look for specific topics that will help solve your problems. How am I to learn a new trick/tip if I skip it because I don't think it applies to me? It has good info info, I just wish it was a better read and more substantial. I have several books on photography for eBay, and this is far from the worst, but it could have been outstanding. Personally I think ""eBay Photos That Sell"" by Dan Gookin is a better book for the non-professional."
1,Key Pad Failure with my phones too....,"Like so many others who have posted reviews about the same problem, I have 3 of 4 phones that are unusable because of key pad failure. I actually came here to buy replacement phones, but after reading the reviews, I will junk the system and try another brand."
2,I'm down to 2 from 4......,"Called Motorola's service hotline after I saw others having the same issues with the handsets that stop working. I was told that there's a 1 year manufacturer's warranty and that if I give them all my serial numbers, they can verify the dates for me. I have the receipt and I know when I bought them....well over a year ago. I have the MD 481 base unit that came with an extra handset and purchased 2 md 41 handsets. 2 of the 4 phones' keypads have stopped working correctly.Didn't have the luck of the other reviewer who is getting new handsets...and that's after I rattled off all of the different Motorola products I currently own.Nice phones...when they work."
5,Excellent phone for large house,"We have been running the Motorola Series 400 system -- main unit plus two expansion phones -- in our home for two years with no problems at all. The greatest advantage is that you just plug in the main unit to an existing phone line. The rest of the expansion phones can go anywhere in the house (or garage)--no need to run a line. Just plug the system in, and it works!PROs--Clear, crisp communications we can use anywhere on our 1-acre lot. We have never had any problem with interference.--Intercoms. We have one phone on each floor of our house. When we want to call the kids for dinner, we just cue the intercom on all floors, and the phones convert to speaker-phone intercoms. So easy!No CONs. In two years, we have had to replace just one of three batteries (at $4.95!)"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE,"Ditto the reviews below. The ""on"" button on the handset is not working so the only way to answer the phone is by pushing the ""speakerphone"" button. To my disgust, Motorola tells me that since the phone is no longer under warranty they will not replace it and - believe it or not - there is no authorized service center that can repair it. In other words, if it breaks the only option is to send it to the landfill. UNBELIEVABLE!"
2,"Started off great, but.....","Just like the other review's....first the 1 button stopped working, followed by the 5 button...now the phone is useless. Very disappointing product from Motorola. Spend your money on something different."
1,"Yuk. Bad battery, buttons stopped after few months.","I bought 3 of these phones, within a few months all of them had battery life issues and the buttons on 2 phones don't work anymore.Bad motorola, bad!"
2,Good Build Quality but Terrible Sound Quality,"As I said in my review of the base system, Motorola has on paper a nice looking system with a lot of neat features; but in reality the sound quality is extremly poor to the point of being useless to me.Also note: in my case the extra handset I bought would not read the ""Shared"" phone directory the that handsets that came with the system shared so there seems to be different revisions between these handsets and the ones coming with the base units.After using these for the last 2 months, I can say this whole MD4XX system from Motorola is not recommended by me. I have now gotten rid of them and am much happier with their replacement (Motorola's new 5.8ghz system)"
2,Keypads fail,"The MD400 series phone has great features - phones work great but, the keypads fail. I have had to replace (2) of the (4) original units and (2) of the units are acting up now. The keys will not work - it seems to be random - sometimes its a #key sometimes it the on/off key. Searching theinternet I found that this is a typical problem with these phones. I am looking for a replacement and I am stearing away from Motorola because of this problem. I don't know if the newer MD700 series has the same problem I have not been able to find any reviews on the units."
2,Keypad failure for us too,This is a decently designed phone with very poor execution. The key pad has failed after about a year of use. One shouldn't expect such cheapness and lack of reliability from Motorola.
1,Keypad Issues,I can honestly say that I have never abused this phone. I bought the answering machine system with one handset and after about 6 months most of the buttons on the keypad quit working. Then I bought a new add-on handset and took extra extra care of it and after about 6 months the buttons quit working on it too. I like the phone and all but it's of little use if the buttons do not work. So save your money and buy something that will last.
5,Motorola expansion phone system,It is easy to use. It has lots of features. The phones are sturdy as well as attractive.
2,Poor quality keypad,"I bought one of these phones and liked the design a lot so I bought a second remote handset. Problem is, I've had the phones only a year and the keypad on one of them has essentially stopped working (most of the numbers anyway). Without the number ""1"" on the keypad working, this phone is pretty worthless!Good phone but quality is bad. I think my one-year warranty is up too."
1,!!!!!!!!!!DON'T BUY MOTOROLA PHONES!!!!!!!!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS PHONE AS A GIFT FOR MY SISTER IN LAWS BIRTHDAY.THE KEY PAD WENT IN JUST ABOUT A YEAR. MOTOROLA IS A COMPANY THE DOES NOT PRIDE IN IT'S PRODUCT, AND WILL NOT FESS UP TO MANY COMPLAINTS ALL IN REGARDS TO THE SAME PROBLEM. THEY WILL NOT MAKE GOOD ON THIS PHONE AND THEY KNOW IT.THEY PROBABLY MADE THE RADIOS THAT FAILED TO WORK FOR THE EMERGENCY WORKERS ON 9-11 THAT FAILED TOO!!I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT BY MOTOROLA AND TELL AS MANY OTHERS NOT TO AS WELL.THEY STINK!!!!"
1,Waste of money!,"Well, from the beginning these phones have had little nuances that have turned into larger ones. Motorola replaced the batteries under warranty back when they first started acting up, stating the batteries were the problem. Put the new batteries in and it helped for a short time.Recently, you have to hit some of the buttons multiple times to make them work and the caller ID screen quit working. I called motorola, and that stated because the phones were out of warranty there was nothing they could do. They told me to clean the key pad, and/or buy new batteries to fix the problem...which is not the problem.Oh well, some companies still stand behind their products, motorola apparently isn't one of them.I've been through so many different phones the past few years, and all have ended up malfunctioning in one way or the other. I just wish someone would make a quality product."
2,No battery life,"I bought these phones about 12 months ago, and the batteries are already dead. The cost to replace the battery is about as much as getting a new phone."
1,Buttons not working,"I purchased three of these phones 26 months ago. The buttons on two of them have not been working for months. The buttons on the third are pretty much shot now as well. Three phones - all worthless if I can't push the buttons. I expected more from Motorola. I'm guessing a cheapie, no-name phone system would have lasted longer and definitely cost me less."
3,what's up with the batteries??,"It seems they don't make phones to last anymore. I bought this phone 2 years ago. Like many others who have written reviews the key pad did go out just at 1 year. Motorola was great about customer service and sent me out 2 new phones. They would not replace the batteries though which were already going out. I replaced the batteries, $18.00 each at Radio Schack and still I have continual problems. Even after being gone and letting each phone sit on the charger for 7 days straight the battery was down within the first few hours. I can't stand this any longer. We are on the phone constantly and it is a big big hassle always trying to talk worrying that the battery is going to go dead and cut you off. I am going out to buy a new phone system, yet again, maybe this time i will stick with a corded phone with a really long, long cord!! Motorola, you get an F for your product and an A for your customer service."
4,Very Good Product,"I purchased this expandable phone system for my Dad a few years ago. The intercom feature was easy to use. My dad worn out the buttons of a couple of the handsets and I ordered replacements this year. Apparently, this an ongoing problem with the handsets. In other reviews, the manufacturer replaced the worn out handsets but I didn't take the time and purchased replacement handsets.The only thing I didn't like about this expandable system is that I couldn't transfer the phonebook to each handset so I spent a lot of time programming each handset so the custom rings for each call group worked."
4,decent phone,"I kind of got freaked out when I read the reviews. I bought this phone for my grandma over a year ago. Her old phone was just wore out. I just ordered an extra cordless unit because of medical problems, she needs one next to her bed. I think it is a very nice, well built phone. I better knock on wood. Nothing has ever gone wrong with it. I hope we dont end up with any keypad problems."
4,Moto is addressing the button problem,"I've had this phone system for a couple of years, and I recently developed the dreaded button problem that everyone is talking about. However, when I called Moto tech support, they told me that they were aware of the problem and that the phones had been re-engineered. They asked me to provide them with the serial numbers of my handsets and told me they'd be sending me 4 new replacement phones (even though my phones are out of warranty). Now that's customer service! Feature-wise, I love the phones. And they have much better range than the 5.8 GHz phones I tried out and returned."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!,"Okay, I've read the reviews and hope the rest of you thinking of purchasing this phone have as well. The basic advice, do not buy this phone or any other phone from Motorola. This phone as well as the MD481 have a keypad that WILL fail in about a year; just past the warranty period. I have called Motorola and they will not claim responsibility for this issue. Other posts have said that they have gotten remedy from Motorola; which is good for them, but now Motorola has stopped that practice. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE OR ANY OTHER PHONE FROM MOTOROLA!!!"
1,Motorola No Longer Offering Replacements,"There are several reviews praising the customer service at Motorola for replacing these defective handsets. Unfortunately that procedure has been discontinued by Motorola. After reading the reviews and having the same problem for the past year with buttons that just refused to work, I called customer service. I explained how these reviews said Motorola would replace the defective handsets. After talking to a customer service representative and a supervisor I was told they no longer will replace the defective handsets and there was nothing they could do. The buttons started malfunctioning after less than 12 months and I'm also on my 2nd battery in less than a year. This phone is junk and Motorola is no longer standing by their product."
1,Poor Quality,"I have four of these handsets and thought they were the greatest invention ever . . . until the keypads started going out. It starts with the 3 and pretty soon you can't hang up the phone! I just contacted customer service, and they are no longer replacing any handsets unless you purchased the unit within the past year. So, unless you want to replace your phone each year, I would stay away from this model."
2,If you want to own it only for 2 years,I initially had three handsets. Two of them are broken because the pads stopped working only after one year for one and another one year for another.
1,I thought this was a joke!,"I could not believe it when I opened the Amazon box for this item. What I received was a ""Help!"" brand bolt and spring kit rather than a Dorman. The top of the plastic was ripped the the bolt wasn't even in the packaging. The packaging itself has scotch tape wrapped around it to hold the plastic to the cardboard backing. Amazon was even nice enough to put two staples at the bottom for added support. The date on the back of this item is January 1994! I can't believe that someone at Amazon actually had the stones to put this item in a box to ship. I might expect this from a third-party seller but not from Amazon. Please see the photos I uploaded for proof. What gives!?!?!"
2,fried onions,"another brand of fried onions that I love was recently discontinued, so i was excited to find this product. unfortunately i was very dissapointed. as soon as i opened the jar, the overwhelming smell was rancid. as bad as this product was, they were very nice about refunding me so I gave them 2 stars instead of one. there was no expiration date on the product."
4,Human Behavior?,This is a well written and humorous take on comparative psychology. The author gives many examples of similar behavior among all primates and even lesser animals to illustrate recent developments from studies of human and animal behavior.
5,The Tirst is The Best!,"OPINION: I think The Thirst is the best book ever. I'm 11 yearsold, my friend told me about the Seniors books and so I read TheTirst. Those books are for ya (young adult) and I read it and it was the best book I ever read. When I was reading it at the chapter called Thirst I was shaking cause it was scary but so good at the same time. My favorit charecter is Deirdre Palmer. ABOUT THE BOOK: The Thirst is a book about two vampires one vampire wants to be a plane human the other wants to be a vampire. In the book 1 of the vampires is after some one the other likes that some one. At the end of the book well you will have to read it. RECEMENDATION: I think you should read this book it is the best. If you don't read it you don't know what your missing!"
2,Come on now..,"I have to say that I didn't like this book. It was way predictable and the only person who dies was never in the yearbook until after her death. I have to say that I just got done reading Seniors 9, and there have only been 7! deaths and only 4 of them have been in the yearbook since the beginning. It really bothers me because Stine can usually write such good murder scenes, and now he kills people by making them hit their heads on gravestones or falling of cliffs? Come on. I agree with Cameron. The who will survive on the side of the book should only really apply to anyone without their picture in the yearbook."
2,R.L. Stine weasles his way out again...,"This is really annoying. R.L. in these books says ""Who will survive?"" Certainly, everyone in the yearbook will.Everyone who gets killed off is someone you've never heard off, and of course all ends happily for the main characters, same for practically everyone on Fear Street who is a main character.I certainly hope R.L. starts to write better and stop with all the same endings and dramatic near death sequences.Because, Stine, I can predict as well as Trisha Conrad, if you don't start writing better, your series of books will be the ones who will die."
4,Superb 'Foscari' from the San Carlo,Anyone who invests in the TDK DVD of 'I Due Foscari is in for a real treat. When the camera is not fixed on the stages it roams around the theatre giving the viewers a chance to admire the theatres sumptuous decor. Leo Nucci as Doge Foscari is simply magnificent presenting an admirable portrayal of a heartbroken father. If he is less successful at portraying the majesty of the doge he cannot be blamed. It is very hard to be majestic when you have curtain material for your dogal robes. Alexandrina Pendatchanska as Lucrezia Contarini has the dramatic power of Maria Callas but is mercifully free of that lady's wobble. Vincenzo La Scola as Jacopo sings magnificently and easily outacts Alberto Cupido(of the La Scala performance)Nello Santi adopts some annoying cuts but conducts what's left of the opera well. In fact the cuts have cost this performance the fifth star I would otherwise have given it
3,Other Purposes,"Although ""Leather Jacket Love Story,"" leaves a great deal to be desire, namely, a story, it accomplishes its homoerotic purpose. I cannot be- lieve the director had any other intention. Christopher Bradley is a James Brolin look-alike and radiates both charm and sensuality but the writers give him no depth of character. The same can be said of everyone else in the movie. Above all, there is no crisis moment to purge the lethally mundane moments throughout. I agree that the best moments are between Mike and Sam, witlessly portrayed as S&M Construction. The young boy who moves to Silverlake should have stayed away. Even so, when all is said and done, it serves as soft porn effectively enough."
1,Save your money!,This movie is nothing more than a thinly vailed porn movie. And a poor one at that!If you like horrendous silly movies this is for you! It had nothing to do with any kindof a gay love story. The queens were horrible and the acting? It just wasn't there.If you want a REALLY good and real look at gay love I strongly recommend Patrik 1.5Now this movie was sensational! But if you buy leather jacket love storyyou might as well flush yourmoney down the toilet
1,"Really, really bad transfer","No matter how bad it may be, any film transferred to DVD deserves the best audio and video quality possible. Unfortunately that's not the case with Leather Jacket Love Story.The transfer looks as though it came from a VHS original, compete with distorted vertical lines, lack of contrast, and extreme artificial edge sharpening. True, the 16mm of the original might not have been the most professional stock, but a decent transfer would have avoided the telltail righmost outlines of a cheap ""sharpening"" filter.Unless you really need to see poorly transferred pictures of a couple of naked actors, you can do much better than this film. ""Hard"" is another indie filmed about the same time as this movie. There's occasional nudity there, too. But what Hard has and Jacket doesn't is better transfer, acting, and story."
2,"Strange, soft-core gay porn","Maybe not porn - but there is plenty of nudity. Some nice, some not so nice. The story is incredibly stupid and unbeliveable and the acting is atrocious.Maybe it would have been better if they went for a plain porn film instead."
1,DREADFUL SOFT PORN,"This is a dreadful soft porn movie masquerading as ""art"" with dreadful acting by an unattractive cast, corny dialogue and filler scenes that could cure insomnia. It is truly unwatchable as a movie and unwatchable as porn!"
1,Too much bla bla bla and no action,"An independent gay theme film which turned out to be dull and uninspiring.I stopped watching it in 45 minute. I couldn't resist yawning.There is nothing revealing in this movie, and black and white shots don't help it either. The plot is average, the acting poor.Some of the dialogues sound sooo fake that it hurts to listen to them (check the scene where our blond angel moves out, horrific!).Music - another misunderstanding. It could have been nice soundtrack if used in a comedy (with action!), but not here.The bottom line? Don't waste your time."
1,It may be cute...but it is not usable.,"I only had the mouse a day, and I love Hello Kitty. The wheel wouldn't scroll and the cursor would only go side to side. I have never returned anything on Amazon, after using this site over 10 years, but this was the first product. It may be good for kids but I don't advise anyone who really uses the computer or internet to purchase this mouse. It is very cheap and very plasticly (if thats a word)."
3,"Very Cute, Works Ok",Not the best mouse in the world but I bought it for my kids room so it does the job.
2,Did not make the cut,"Bought it to split cherry wood from a tree that was taken down this summer. Sharpened the blade after a few swings bounced off of the rounds I was trying to split, did not matter. After an hour or so of having it either bounce off or barely cut into the wood, I gave up. Thought it was me at first, but gave it to my neighbor to try with the same result."
2,Ames true temper 8 pound splitting maul,"When I received this I was extremely disappointed. Since the merger,looks like quality control has gone to hell. I've bought in the past Ames and true temper both were excellent but that was 25 years ago. The cutting face of the mall was totally jagged with slag. Had never been ground off or sharpened. It's a good thing I own lots of equipment and have the knowledge to use it. Got out the Mikita 4.50in grinder and proceeded to correct the problem."
5,The Beer Can Collector's Bible,This is the greatest reference book for antique beer cans ever!!! Incredible color photos and great information about the cans!!!! Loved it!!!
3,Polsc,Nice... It's for my polsc class so I must read it. Its been a bit helpful. Helps to understand some things if my professors going too fast
4,Editions change,"This work has undergone at least one change in lead author and at least two thorough revisions (of which the 8th edition is one) to date -- not uncommon with standard textbooks that have endured for decades.Whatever the virtues or failings of the current edition of this title, as the beginning of the school year approaches, readers of textbook reviews on Amazon should remember to compare the edition being sold against the editions for which comments were written."
4,A solid methods book,"I bought this book for a research methods class that I am taking for my Masters in Public Administration program. When the class started, the professor had us switch to another textbook, but I read this book because I had already paid for it and I knew that it would help me with the class. The material was easy to work with and was presented in a logical sequence."
1,Not happy,I have not received this item. It should be in by now and it hasn't came in. Maybe if it actually came in I could review it!!
5,We love these series!,"My 8 year old daughter LOVES these books. We are so happy when they come up as a free book because it is a nice surprise. However, we willingly pay for them also when necessary. Good, clean Christian book with lots of adventure and history. Highly recommend!"
4,Absolutely amazing,"I called the Leapfrog company and found out that the cartridges are not being sold in stores yet...I have three kids using the toys, and one cartridge just insn't enough. The overall performance is GREAT!! My daughter has improved her spelling of commonly used words overnight, and my son is loving three-digit addition. The toys/cartridges offer a chance to make learning even more fun by saying the childs' name and customizing the curriculum to his/her needs. I love it!!Good luck!"
3,buy the books instead,"The cartridges erase whatever data you downloaded from the LeapFrog site the time before. So, if you order the online package and print several sets for your child, you must download the pages your child wants to play each time. You would have saved time and money in the long run to have bought the books themselves."
5,A must for learning those spelling lists!,I use this cartridge to allow my kids to use their weekly spelling list when playing with their Twist and Spell toys. They have fun with them and trade them back and forth. Even my 5 year-old plays with them.
3,Ginger the Werewolf,"Ginger Snaps was a pleasant surprise. I actually saw Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning before I saw this one. I enjoyed Ginger Snaps Back so much that I was enticed to watch this one. Now all I need to see is Ginger Snaps 2. If it is anything like the other two, then I'll be satisfied. These movies did not get a lot of hype. Not that I know of anyway. But they deliver. Good movie. Watch it and enjoy."
3,"Started out great, but...","This looked interesting enough for me to rent, and it started off really well. However, it started to unravel into a campy flick with some bad acting and writing. The ending especially disappointed me, which was sad because this film honestly did start out with real promise (and remained so till about halfway through) I hate it when movies start out great and go downhill. Feh."
5,Love this movie.,"This movie is one of my favorites. I own all three in the series and wouldn't dream of parting with it. It has some gore moments to it, but balances with dark humor shared between the sisters and their family. Love the mom when she finds the finger. Great movie. deffinately something that I would recommend."
1,1star for the quality,It seems and feels all the same. Like if I will watch the movie on youtube. Same quality shmality. Great movie. But it feels like I've paid for a pirated dvd.Whatever. It is just plain bad bad dvd. But the movie was good. I wish they made more than 3 movies.
2,Not worth my time,"I saw this over a year ago and I wish that I hadn't. Maybe I'd like it more if I were female, but I didn't connect with any of the characters on any level. If you need to see a werewolf movie see Dog Soldiers instead."
3,jumpy picture,This DVD was very shaky but when I worked with it it started to work alright. The movie itself was OK. Not exactly what I had expected but as far as a vampire movie it was a B
4,Desiree's Ginger Snaps Review,This movie was definatly not your average horror film.I had many likes and dislikes like for one how Sam and Gingers sister found a warewolf cure so fast that startled me but the fact that I think Kris Lemche (Sam) is like the hottest guy on the planet made me like the movie more!I also thought Gingers parents were funny they shouldve been shown more.In this flim ther were an excellent cast they all played there parts so well. Especially Kris Lemche!We should see him more in the us!
1,THE quintessential idiot's horror movie favorite,"Wow. The amount of 5 star reviews on amazon and the internet in general praising this movie is incredible. Simply one of the worst movies ever made, horror and otherwise. To give this 5 stars is to say Justin Bieber is Jimi Hendrix. I don't feel I need to explain myself, the first 20 minutes of this crap is about a chick getting her period, go watch Buffy and True Blood if you like this garbage."
4,GOOD FILM,"WASN'T EXPECTING MUCH FROM THIS FLICK, BUT I WAS PLEASENTLY SURPRISED! EXCELLENT ACTING,STORY & EFFECTS. THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T GIVE IT FIVE STARS IS THAT I'D JUST WATCHED 'BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF' DIRECTLY BEFORE AND IT WAS EVEN BETTER!!BUT ANYWAY GINGER SNAPS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE!SO BUY IT!!"
4,Excellent new Horror...,This is a very dark-edged horror flick that is a lot better than the standard I Know What you did/Valentine hollywood (...stuff) that has been coming out as of late...Really worth checking out.
4,Ginger snaps entertainment back into Horror,"This movie at first glance from the box seemed to me like a cheaply made flop of a horror flick but i watched it anyway *thats the kind of person i am* and i was quite surprised. unlike 99% of all recently released ""technological-computerised-couldnt scare a 104 year old woman"" horror rip offs, this film goes back to the REAL horror genre and was very entertaining. the only reason i didnt give this film 5 stars was because personally, i didnt find the ""final transformation"" very convincing. other then that, i definitely recommend this movie. the very best horror movie that ive seen released in quite a while."
2,Because being a werewolf is not just for guys!,"That's the essential point being made with this movie. It's a ""grrl power"" themed message that females can be werewolves too. Who'd have thought women would ever shatter THAT glass ceiling. Somebody's not minding the constant ""patriarchal oppression"" of women in society if we're allowing them to turn into fictional raging blood thirsty beasts from hell.Or was this meant as a metaphor for what feminism has turned women into?I'll add, Katharine Isabelle (Ginger) is a very good actress, she stole the movie."
2,"A female version of American Werewolf in London, Decent","Ginger Snaps is a decent black-horror comedy with good make-up effects and some effective scenes. This movie is a lot like An American Werewolf in London but you won't see a dead corpse or no amazing werewolf transformation. Two sisters decide to take photographs and encounter a wolf and one of which is bit and then as they run the wolf follows and then the wolf gets runnned over and smashed to pieces, soon the girl is acting weird and then turns into a werewolf.Pros:Good make-up effectsAtmosphere(The Canadian woods were the girls are attacked)some funny scenesCons:Some bad actingplot holesOverall a decent movie that's way better than that werewolf dud Silver Bullet."
2,THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE!,"Yes, it really is a great movie. Smart, engaging, and witty in a REAL way, not in the usual post-""Scream"" self-referential kind of way.--BUT-- if you are a fan at ALL of this movie, do avoid the American ARTISAN release. Not only is it a poor pan-and-scan release, but it also is devoid of ANY extras.Instead, be sure to suss-out the extras-packed Canadian version which has a crisp, bright letterboxed image and MUCH better box-art.It really is worth it. This horrible Artisan-release is just another in a long line of sub-par releases they seem to be specializing in these days... pity!"
3,"Great movie, horrible edition","A honest-to-Cronenberg horror movie that treats lycantropy as a degenerative disease and not a ""kewl curse"". This edition is horrible, however, so it's better if you hop on to Amazon.ca for the Canadian collector's edition (which is widescreen and has extra features other than the trailer)."
4,An overlooked gem!!,"I rented Ginger Snaps based on a review I read in Entertainment Weekly during the film's limited theatrical release last fall. I wasn't expecting much even though that review was fairly positive. When the movie was over I just sat there in stunned silence. A truly excellent horror film!! For starters, if you don't get creeped out by the opening title sequence, you must already be dead. Secondly, this movie has so many wonderful layers that I can't even cover them all in this space. It's a horror movie, a black comedy, a coming of age story, a family drama, a social satire and on and on and on and it covers all of these bases beautifully. And on top of all that it is SCARY SCARY SCARY!!!! It was so refreshing to see, once the monster rears it's head, an actual animatronic creation rather than some glossy, phony digital creation. Just rent this movie. You don't even have to be a horror fan. Just shut up and rent it!!!!"
2,Don't buy! Get the Canadian DVD from Amazon in Canada!!!,"This is a horrible dvd version of a great movie. Full Screen, not dolby surround NO EXTRAS, no insert card, a black and white label.... The Canadian version is Widescreen, dolby 5.1, has deleted scenes, commentary, an insert card...you get the picture. Amazon Canada has it, it works on US DVD players, and it's only a couple of bux more once you convert the dollars...and as usual, amazon is amazing and I got mine within 24 hours!!!"
3,"My Sister, What Big Teeth You Have!","3 1/2 Stars = Very goodHere is a werewolf film with a different kink in it's tail. A view of Lycanthropy from the teenage feminine side. All in all, a very good howl, but no ""Howling.""Teenage angst with big eyes, big nose, & big teeth!Grandma has left the building!"
3,A decent horror flick,"I frankly expected more from the movie with all the hype about it on the reviews. I thought it was a ok movie at best. Its no Silver Bullet, but its not suppose to be.Its basically, a spin off of the whole teen wolf genre. I wouldn't watch it again, but I suppose if your just looking for something to kill time, this will do."
5,"""EXCELLENT!!!""","""Not many horror flix get a 5 star from me, but I thought this one was fantastic!! Very well done with lots of Gore! I also love the ""Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning"" & ""Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed"", also very well done...unlike most sequals."""
3,good,"This movie is good starts out great , and kind of fizzles. But all in all if you like wherwolves this is great movie. I love Ginger Snaps Unleashed better. Its more modern of course. But i also love the olden days. But its not the greates movies. Actually lately i dont know what is .?Lol."
3,"Interesting, and gross.","This movie was quite original in its way but it was really disgusting. I don't think they needed to have people practically being ripped inside out, same with the dogs. But it was a bit funny and entertaining, I'd recommend it."
2,The First But Not the Best,"I wasn't that wild about this movie the first time I saw it but I might have to go back and watch it again.I caught the two sequels on the Sci-Fi Channel recently and enjoyed them both much more than I remembered the original. So if you're a huge fan of the first movie, I will ammend this review later.But I did want to encourage anyone who does like this movie to seek out the sequels. The writing is better and the production values are as well, particularly in the third film (THE BEGINNING) set back in the American Frontier days.I wonder if this was like the Mad Max series: the original MAD MAX was a cheap drive-in movie that they could afford to make at the time. When it made money in America, they went on to produce THE ROAD WARRIOR (or MAD MAX 2, its international title), a bigger movie that played everywhere outside the drive-in."
1,ginger snaps,This movie was such a lame B movie that you could see throw the cheese a mile away. Real amateur movie making. You had to accept leaps of faith and still it wasn't scary but laughable.
3,GINGER SNAPS,"i have only seen Emily Perkins in ""It"" so thats one of the reasons i got this dvd out. it was a really good movie. it's about 2 sisters..well im 14. can't explain it as well as other ppl i guess but yeah just watch it u might like it if u like...unusual movies. this is kind of unusual. but really good aswell."
2,About as bad as I thought it was going to be.,"Really this movie wasn't real bad, but it was your typical ""new"" horror movie. It thought that it was definitely made in the same fashion as some of the other teeny horror movies like Scream, I Know What You Did, etc... which I am not a real big fan of. Also it was a little too serious for me. It had pretty good acting and special effects, but that is where it stops. Any parent that is as stupid as those portrayed in this film should be taken out behind the woodshed. All in all I think that I was generous giving this movie two stars. Something about it just didn't sit well with me."
3,good,"I thought this movie was good nothing wonderful...over looked and underrated YES ....I see alot of movies like this at the video store with similar cover box art and I never bother with them cuz usually their terrible after seeing these reviews I got really curious and rented it..Suprisingly the acting was good and theres a lot of violence & gore...If your into werewolves I definately recommend....Not scary but it's cool like in a ""Lost Boys"" way if that makes any sense to anyone hehe !"
3,The worst DVD I own,"This is a great film but an awful DVD. This is the first DVD I have seen that does not have scene selection! How lame is that. The sound is 2.0 and in the middle of the movie the dubbing is off. Their voices do not correspond with the lip movements at all. It's like watching an old kung fu movie. It's cool for a while but then starts to really piss you off. Ginger Snaps is a very cool flick. It sucks that Artisan did not think enough of this film to package it more favorably. I highly recommend this movie, but don't think the DVD is going to be anything great. I'm sure they will rerelease it soon in a mucch better version. Cheers!"
5,cool movie,"This DVD edition of Ginger Snaps is the one to get. It has deleted scenes and other features not found in the other DVD editions. Anyways the movie itself is pretty good, mixes were-wolfs with high school girls and features blood and gore and humor. Overall definitely worth watching, just be sure to get this DVD edition."
5,GINGER SNAPS RULES!!!,"I am suprised that this movie didn't make it to the big screen!!! It was good! It was sad and touching, and full of blood! The werewolf was pretty slick looking! A pretty good cast too!!!Good movie!!! Give it a try!!!"
4,GREAT Canadian horror movie,"I can't help but feel Cronenberg's style all over this film. It's a low budget Canadian horror movie that brings up all sorts of sexual overtones, although it is decidedly funnier than anything the yuck-master has done.It may look cheesy, but there is a lot going on in this girl-bites-man story. The girls are GREAT, particularly Katharine Isabelle in the title role of Ginger. If she looks familiar, that's because she was on The X-Files and DaVinci's Inquest, and played the part of the sullen teen girl in ""Insomnia"".Apparently they're making a sequel. Grr."
3,A Great Canadian Flick,"Ginger Snaps blew me away when I first watched it. I think what initally got first me was the humour and repateur of the two leads of Ginger and Bee played by the mind goggling Emily Perkins and Katherine Isabelle. Their dark gluemy world fascinated me and to some extent I could relate to certain aspects of their lives. This take on werewolves and the terror that interrupts these sisters lives is fascinating. One of the best werewolves tales out there, and I like how it's set in Canada, the settings gives it that extra cold feeling and atmosphere. My only loss is, I really want to see and get my hands on a copy of the version of the DVD with the tons of extras but I'm having a hard time doing so."
3,Get the Canadian version of the DVD (...if you want extras).,"I nearly purchased this U.S. no-frills, full-screen version of the ""Ginger Snaps"" DVD, but a friend turned me on to a Canadian version (also Region 1) that shows the feature in widescreen and also has DVD extras. (The Canadian version sports a different package design.)I realize that not everybody is into having letterboxed versions and this may not be a movie that you need extras, so the above cautionary note may not apply to you. In that case, the U.S. version should be okay for you."
4,Surprisingly good horror flick,"When my boyfriend brought home Ginger Snaps, I sighed unhappily. It seemed he had been perusing the wall of low-budget no brainer horror flicks once again. However, the seemingly cheesey premise of Ginger Snaps developed itself into a great horror movie. Katherine Isabelle gave a great performance as the troubled teen and soon to be werewolf. Although the effects were less than dazzling, the overall impact of the movie was truly scary! Not since the Blair Witch Project have I so thoroughly enjoyed a horror movie. Since that first time, we've rented Ginger Snaps twice more!"
3,I told you girls..no more death in the house,I saw this movie last nite on SAT TV. whoo-boy another lame werewolf flick with closetgoth sisters.Story is the girls are in the park late at nite when what appearsto be a quickblur with large teeth attacks one of the girls and carries her off screaming.Well yep..you guessed it she's been bitten by a lycanthrope and we all know soon she will become one.The plot and story are lame the acting however is very competentand the girls play their parts well SFX are kinda short and cheapan OK movie I give it 3 stars for a credible effortoh..for any of you who know Mimi Rogers (she is a hottie but not in this film) she plays the dimball mother of the girls
4,NOT BAD!,"Of the two versions of IOLANTHE available this is bar far the best. The purists will certainly balk at some of the tampering, but ever since the Joseph Papp Broadway version of THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE nobody seems to be able to leave the G&S works alone! All things considered this version is easy to digest and captures the spirit of the thing! Now that The D'Oyly Carte is long gone all we Savoyards have is our memories of traditional productions."
4,"Excellent production, but why make changes to the libretto.","The production, quality of acting and singing, and presentation of this show is truely excellent.The singing is wonderful, the dancing is just delightful. The pre-show, backstage scene is great.My one complaint is that the Stratford Festival people take far too much liberty with the words of Gilbert. For some unknown reason they replaced the last 2 verses of the ""Nightmere Song"" with their own words. Gilbert's verses are absolutely delightful. Why change these. They ""modernized"" other parts of Gilbert's libretto as well.Why would anyone presume to write G&S; dialogue better than Gilbert. When references are dated or localized, it is a joy to study these references and discuss them. My goodness, that is one of the delights of G&S;."
3,Not what Gilbert had in mind,"First of all, so many of the lyrics have been reworded that one can scarcely call this a Gilbert and Sullivan at all! Sullivan, yes; Gilbert,no. For some reason, the director has decided to use a framing device: a fairly inept troupe is putting on a production of ""Iolanthe."" This works to the extent of a few mild laughs but the whole concept ruins the beauty of the work and detracts from the intended satire. Now and then, as in the Act I finale, Sullivan's music is distorted into something entirely at odds with his score: in this case, a minstrel-show beat for no particular reason. So while this is a visually pleasing venture, it is not what the box advertizes. Caveat emptor, you know."
2,Very disappointing,"Disappointing. After seeing their performance of The Gondoliers, which is the best I have ever seen on the stage or on the screen, this looked like a group trying to put people off Gilbert and Sullivan for ever. Only Maureen Forrester behaved like a professional intent on keeping her reputation in tact. I did not watch the whole thing."
3,Unicorn Magically Becomes A Boneless Chicken,"At risk of being too picky, my 4 yr.-old daughter should not have been responsible for keeping the unicorn's head from lifelessly dangling straight down.When my daughter quickly grew tired/annoyed from the awkwardness of holding the unicorn's head up, it wasn't clear what ""white thing"" she was supposed to be riding.My daughter was riding the subject of Gary Larson's funniest cartoons; it looked as if she was riding a ""boneless chicken.""."
3,"Nice costume, but...","I only gave this 3 stars because when it arrived, I took it out of the box to put in a smaller one to wrap. Four of the bows fell off by barely touching, and several other little things pulled off too easily. The costume itself is great, but it doesn't take much to make the adornments fall off. Daughter was happy, but I feel like I spent too much money considering how easily the stuff came off."
3,"Right Look, but...","My granddaughter loved the Unicorn Pegasus for Halloween, however, I had to place a firm tube in the neck to hold the head upright, and also add more padding. Maybe they can improve on this costume next year?Thanks Amazon!"
3,It's a good book for beginners,I can not use the software with Win95 I'd like to know were can I found the software portio32.dll to use it with Win95.
2,This book looked promising but it ultimately disappointed,"The most frustrating thing about this book is that it does not explain anything about how the circuits work. This makes it almost impossible to fix the errors in the circuits as shown (yes, there are errors). Also, some of his choices for components are dubious, like the 25-pin serial port connectors (why not use a 9 pin?) and the flat (ribbon) Centronics printer cable with 36-pin connector.I also agree with most of the complaints in the other reviews.This book could have been so much better if only the workings of the circuits were described (e.g., why a certain resistor value was chosen, why one circuit needs external power and one doesn't, etc.)"
1,Terrible,"The whole subject really could be picked off the net. I ama EE (but rusty) and wanted a simple book to get started prototyping a design off a parellel port.This book was a hindrence. The so called diagrams are horrid, the writup terse and cryptic, and the scope very limited. (...)If you are a Technical Hobbyist this book will be useless to you. In fact if you have a pulse this book will be useless to you."
2,Look for others,"It's not something to learn something out of the stuff author suggests. You have to guess what's happening inside the code. But if you are looking for something to show your girl friend ,what's inside the book may be useful. What's nice about this book is the way circuts are explained."
1,Biggest Loser,I just picked this book up at the local library as a give-away; even they had no use for it and I understand why. Still haven't been able to make the programs run; there are no schematics provided. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this one.
1,Disappointed and aggravated.,CDROM did not contain the circuit diagrams as promised#%$@^&*( Software is written in VB4 and won't run unless you have VB4. (I have VB5). Does not give part numbers or manufacturers for some of the most important parts like the pressure sensor or the temperature resistor sensor or where you can buy them. Book may be useful to someone learning perfboard layout and design. The CAD software that comes with it is so stripped down that it is almost useless. You can't judge a book by its cover because this books cover is glossy and colorful and expensive.
5,Works Fine & Cute!,"I ordered this for my 5 year-old daughter to use at her school desk. It's a great size for her, not too small. It has a hard surface which wipes clean easily. And it's really cute!"
1,soon to be garbage,"I love Hello Kitty and am really disappointed with this product. Within a week it warped so bad. The other reviewer said that they worked to flatten out the pad after it warped, but I think I can only put it into the garbage soon as it is too distracting like this to work with."
4,Love Hello Kitty!,"This mousepad is great. Unlike other pads that are a typically cloth material, this is a plastic top design, so it's washable. Just use a cloth. It's similar to vinyl placemats.Since I can't rate by half stars here, I would take off only half a star for this same fact, as I occasionally need to lift my mouse and get my pointer again. Seems it's a bit too slick at times.But hey! This is Hello Kitty, so it's worth it ;)"
3,Just okay.,"This set of wood turning tools is just okay. They are fairly short in length, so they are made for a mini-lathe. They don't stay sharp for long, but as long as you have a bench grinder close by to re-sharpen them, you'll be okay. The parting tool is probably the sturdiest of the three. The box is nice so they have a place to stay when not in use. If you're just starting out and unsure if a wood lathe is for you, these are economical and an okay place to start until you decide if you want to invest in better quality."
4,Specialized Pen turning kit,"Not the best, but much better than I expected for the price. Easy to sharpen and holds the edge pretty well."
5,WOW !!!,"I used to get this mag and really enjoyed it, but I did not get it at this LOW PRICE....Thanks.....if you are a professional or just starting a new hobby this is for you.....great articles and great ideas....a must have....."
2,"herman melville: typee, omoo, mardi","took this along to the south seas, but the hardcover book was too big and heavy. typee is a good autobiographical account of jumping ship and living among the cannibals in the marquesas, a good adventure story. as an anthropological account it was fictionalized and embellished for effect. moby dick was the high point for herman melville, omoo and mardi were low points and can be skipped."
1,Not what it describes,"I ordered this gift for a baptism since it had a cross ribbon attached and played the song ""Jesus Loves Me"". When I received the lamb in the mail, the ribbon was the only thing that looked like the lamb I ordered. The lamb also played ""Rock A Bye Baby"" even though the attached tags stated: ""plays Jesus Loves Me"". I was very disappointed and don't want to order another one because I fear I will get the same thing."
3,Cute but...,"Very cute but the music plays for only a short time, a VERY short time. Not really worth the price."
5,Excellent...Adorable Gift!,"Excellent...Adorable Gift! All new babies should have a toy that plays ""Jesus Loves Me"". I will definitely purchase again! Received on time and in perfect condition! Great Job!"
5,Baby gift,"I bought this for my sister and she loves it. She plays this one and the anothersong on her belly at night. I hope baby loves it, too when she arrives."
4,Very sweet for a baby Christening,"I bought this for my niece for her Christening along with a baby Bible. The sheep is very cute, and soft. The music is pretty and I love that the head moves slowly. My niece is 4 months old and likes to rub her face on it because it is so soft."
3,soft,The lamb is very soft and cuddily. Music however only worked for a couple of days. Now you wind it up and it only plays for a minute.
5,Best Cheesy B movie ever after Death Race 2000,"Me and my friends are currently deployed in the Middle East and we started getting B movies (they re cheapper Duhh!!) and we ve seen a lot of crappy ones .But this one, even if you are not a wrestling fan (like my buddies) you gonna love it,cheesy script,one liners,gore some T&A and best of all some good old wrestling mix with bad acting that is soo bad that is soo good(if you get my drift) Cheaap Buy. Army guys 2 thumbs up!!!!"
4,A cut above most B movie selections.,"This movie is quite unique, it is a mexican wrestling-zombie flick hybrid. Most of the characters are in wrestling masks. A palatable plot and great soundtrack make it very watchable. It's also presented in Dolby 5.1, which is rare for a low budget movie. The bad point would be the somewhat phony looking gore scenes, otherwise the camera work is great.I recommend this film."
3,Lucha Cheesey,Low budget Luchadors vs Zombies flick. It was a decent cheesey B movie with a group of super hero like Luchadors vs evil Luchadors with a zombie army.
4,HARD TO EXPLAIN BUT VERY ENJOYABLE,"I was expecting a dingy Troma like film, but this film is suprisingly refreshing. Much funnier than I expected, the gore is cartoon like but it stll works. I also thoroughly enjoyed the music, some great songs enhanced the whole experience. This movie is probably not for everyone, but I can recommended it to most people looking for an hour or so of good fun."
1,1 of the worst movies ever!,I bought this movie on clearance for $6 somewhere thinking it was an anime and ended up being a really really bad movie. The movie was so bad I couldn't even finish watching it I had to turn it off after only a few minutes. At least it was only $6 instead of $20 and in the trash the cover and DVD went since I can't return it. What an expensive DVD case for $6. Owe well. I don't see how all the other reviewers except 1 saw this movie as being one the greatest movies ever not.
1,when i ordered these particular dry erase markers i expected all of them to work. Black and blue did not.,these dry erase marlers came highly recommended. When I received my order the black and the blue were dry and did not work.
4,Awesome and tasty!,"At first I thought these cookies were going to be really sugary and sweet, but instead they are dense and taste more hearty than most granola bars. They are low in calories so if you're really hungry when you're on the go, you can eat two without breaking your calorie limit. They are also small enough to roll around in your purse or school bag for snacks during the day. It leaves you satisfied rather than still hungry."
5,this product works,"Hi, I found Source Natural Hangover Formula (SNHF) several years ago after reading an article about how vitamin B especially is used up somehow in alcohol metabolism, or at least the % B in the blood drops after drinking, and that headaches assoicated with hangovers relates to vitamin Bs. I tried SNHF at the recommendation of a vitamin store person and it works, eliminating headaches. My wife and I both take 2 or 3 tabs before going out for a meal when we know we will have wine or other alcohol. WE don't drink much but we both will get a headache and hangover now if we forget to take SNHF, but do not have a hangover if we remember to take it. It works, and I keep it around just in case. And it is a lot less expensive online (about half price) from Amazon than buying it at the local store."
2,"Disappointed, plus they are HUGE!","These pills are HUGE. And I'm someone who takes eight vitamin pills at a time. 3/8 in x 7/8 inch. Like swallowing rocks. I'm not sure I have enough stomach acid to break these down. I can feel them sitting there for quite awhile. So the jury's still out. Tried Hangover Prevention Formula last night with cactus fruit extract and woke up every hour all night long, though I don't feel quite as sick to my stomach now as usual. I always drink 3 full glasses of Veuve champagne, that's it."
2,Not that comfortable,"I only like the chocolate brown color of these shoes. They ware too tight, not easy to break in. I've tried other Vaneli shoes, and wasn't really impressed with them either."
4,True Stories Collection DVD about desperation.,"This movie is about a military man having marital problems, and seeing no way out, making a desperate choice to fake his own death. Gary Cole is a strong lead as the man, and interestingly enough, his wife in real life plays his wife in this movie."
3,joy o joy,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE.I SAW IT ON LIFETIME ONCE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAY I THOUGHT I WOULD ENJOY WATCHING IT AGAIN. THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THE SERVICE PROVIDED BY YOU WAS NOT THE BEST, BECAUSE IT WAS. THANKS"

5,Everyone should have a copy of this book!!!!,I think this is such a wonderfully done book. The pictures and discriptions of the plants and their uses are exellent.All the pictures are very clear & the discriptive history of the plants and what the Shamans used them for are well defined.This is a very educational book and I agree with another reviewer that said it should be required reading in all schools.Proper education and not propaganda is the answer. Knowledge is your friend.
5,Entheogens: Professional Listing,"""Plants of the Gods"" has been selected for listing in ""Religion and Psychoactive Sacraments: An Entheogen Chrestomathy."" http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy"
1,bad craftmanship,"The cribbage board is missing pegging holes, the pegs that are suppose to be different colors cannot be distiguished. Overall not a well made product."
1,Dick Francis can rest easy on his throne.,"The cover blurb for the book suggested that Dick Francis should move over because Francome is serious competition.As if.While the writer clearly knows what he's on about when it comes to racing, he seems to have never bothered to learn the basics of plot. There's pretty much everything I hate in a detective novel thrown in here, from hokey writing to gratuitous sex scenes.Take a miss on this one."
5,Real Ninja Stories,This series seems to follow actual Ninja lives and technics. Great charactors and story lines. English subtitles not hard to follow along.
1,Oh dear.,What a shame - more wonderful characters either being under-used or over-abused. I really wish I hadn't read this book.
1,gone ot goodwill,"didn't list this for sale here because I would be ripping someone off. Tales fo the city was delightful, this is drivel"
4,Evocotive,"What is wonderful about this book is how James' characters evoke a palpable sense of cynicism which one realizes is perfectly understandable given the story's circumstances. She does a beautiful job crafting a bleak, depressing reality to which the progenitor is at first not only resigned but a willing partner. But there would be no story if that did not change, and as the progenitor's malaise is displaced by hope and life the pace and viewpoint of the book change, too. This book has a great premise, great plot, and great atmosphere. It's the only one I've read by James and I really enjoyed it."
3,If you haven't seen the movie...,"This book does well as a stand-alone. I saw the movie and liked it so I thought I should read the book. My daughter read it first and was angry that the movie and the book were so different.Knowing that before I began reading helped me to separate the two and by doing that I was able to appreciate the book as much as I did the movie. The story and characters were able to keep my interest and sympathies going, though the beginning takes off slowly."
3,"Gret concept, great plot, poor execution","Children of Men has a very intriguing concept and a solid plotline. And yet enjoyment of a book stems as well from the execution. The style of writing and the treatment of the main character bog down this book. I knew where the story was headed, I wanted to see the plot unfold, but I was constantly frustrated having to wade through paragraph after paragraph of drivel. Drivel that can only spout from history professors. While the author has done a great job of showing the inner mindset and trips down memory lane of a middle aged history professor, the inner working of this particular history professor are not very interesting, and detract from the book reading experience."
3,"Good story, but poorly written.","This is an interesting story. I enjoyed it very much. It is however poorly written. The first five chapters are in first person and then it switched to third person. She also used to much of Xan said:, Julian said: sort of dialogue."
2,The movie's story is better told than that of the book on which it is based,"The movie's story is better told than that of the book on which it is based.I have rule when starting to read a book: If the first 10 through 20 pages of a book bore the bejeesus out of me, I don't continue on with it. I would have applied this rule to P.D. James's ""The Children of Men"", if not for the fact that I started reading the book after having seen the superb movie on which the book is based. I am only continuing on--more truthfully, slogging through--because I am curious as to the difference between the story of the movie and the book."
3,A grim dystopia,"Dame Phyllis has deceived many into believing she was continuing in her normal genre, mystery. .... This is not a mystery novel, though it has suspense. (So did the Odyssey!) Another error is to assume it is science fiction and is so regarded by those who classify C. S. Lewis as a sci-fi writer. What we do have is a grim dystopia, almost apocalyptic, with overt religious underpinnings. Most of the plot gives a futuristic rendering of the Nativity story--e.g., a woodshed for a manger. At the end Dame Phyllis resonates with the Lord of the Ring, the corrupting power of a symbol. I would fault the work only because the parallels to the Gospels and Tolkien's work seem too overt. By the way, she also deceives some about her gender. ..."
2,Yawn!,"A good book if you like to be aware of an author using lots of uncommon words when an ordinary one will do. Good for vocabulary expansion. Story - Ha ha! Don't bother! At one point the book had me turning pages fast and reading with real interest, but that was it! The edition I read had a review on the back ""A most tender love story"" Where? Characters did not come over well especially towards the end of the book. It did seem good at the beginning as far as the ideas of a story go, but it feels as though the author is fast running out of both ideas and interest by the end. I only read this book because I was bored and there was nothing else to do. That's the only time I would recommend you to pick it up. If your interested, go and get a copy from the library, but save your hard-earned for something else!"
2,Not Good enough.,Very disappointing. Written in a marvellous way but with no content and too much description. This could have been OKish short story but it dragged as a novel. PD James clearly has no idea about sci-fi writing.
2,Unfulfilled promise...,"Start with an interesting premise - all males have been rendered sterile simultaneously; follow through with this - the last humans was born some 20 years ago and when the remnants of the human race die, there will be no more man; then present hope - a woman becomes pregnant. How will here pregnancy be received by the powers that be?What could have been a great book is marred by two dimensional characters and an ending which seems as though it was tacked on when James couldn't figure out where to go with the story.A great book is a ""good story, well told"". In this case, an interesting premise didn't translate into a good story and it certainly wasn't well told.Will I ever want to read it again? Nope! Would I recommend it to a friend? Nope!Don't waste your time..."
3,Not As Good As the Film Version,"This book was well written but lacked the pace and variation of the film. It's worth reading, but do't expect the movie."
3,Liked the movie better,"Having seen the movie first, maybe I was expecting too much - because the novel was very different than the movie. The novel had some interesting ideas, but they seemed rushed and unfulfilled. The story seems much smaller in scope, and I wanted to find out more of the world PD James had created."
5,Thought provoking story,"This is a book that will make you think about it afterward. It was a page turner driven by the characters - flawed human beings. Their country crumbles into police state yet a small, powerless group of people strive for change. Some are driven by ego, some inspired by faith in God, some simply can no longer ignore what is wrong. Is this how all rebellions start? The story highlights ordinary people doing extraordinary things - good & evil. The ending doesn't make any promises. The movie is great but modifies the plot to emphasize the visuals."
2,This is the rare situation where the movie is better than the book,"The fact that the premise of this book is so interesting made me all the more disappointed that the execution of it was so poorly done. The characters are shallow, cliched, and very poorly developed. To make matters worse, the main character experiences a significant change in his fundamental personality that is completely unbelievable. And the final scene of the book is so cloying that it makes me shudder to remember it. If the premise hadn't been so intriguing, I would have only given this book one star.This is the only time I've ever been able to say that the movie far far surpassed the book. The movie differs significantly from the book, basically abandoning everything except the main plot line. I would highly recommend the movie, but unless you're into any dystopian novel regardless of quality, I wouldn't recommend the book."
1,Weary sci-fi tropes badly written,"Brian W. Aldiss's great novel Greybeard, published in the sixties, uses the same themes as James (i.e. no children are being born on the planet) but is original and funny, elegaic and sad. Yet Aldiss's novel is sidelined as science fiction and James's book, which uses very tired and unoriginal sf tropes, is described by its fans as 'too real to be sf'. This is nonsense.If you really want to see this theme explored with originality by a fine writer, go to the Aldiss. This is one of the best examples I know of a bad book by an establishment writer being admired by people with no knowledge of fine literary sf and believing that it 'can't be sf because it's too real'. If you want literature which deals with realities try some Aldiss, Ballard, M. J. Harrison, China Mieville, Thomas M. Disch, John Sladek and a dozen others. This book was an insult to my intelligence."
2,A Disappointment,"A Disappointment. P. D. James delivers a fascinating premise -- a near future in which the human race has become infertile and is going extinct. And she goes nowhere with it. It would be nice to see her go in a standard Science Fiction direction, exploring the psychological, sociological, and political implications of this change. (And she does some of this, and does it well. But it's not nearly enough.) If she didn't like the standard route, she could have used the premise as a backdrop for exploring character. She doesn't. I barely remember who the characters were or why they did what they did. Add to all this a trite and abrupt ending. It distresses me whenever a book like this comes along -- amazing concept but poor execution. All I can think is, now no one will ever do it RIGHT."
2,Ripper of a Premise -- Fails in the Execution,"I would love to have seen a really good speculative fiction author take PD James' fantastic SF premise and run with it, because this book turns out to be pretty darned dull. I purchased the book based on the premise, and was disappointed.The characters, all of them, are wooden and uninteresting. The world-building ends up being rather pale. There are a few powerfully evocative scenes portraying the social response to the ""whimper, not a bang"" end-times of the human race, but not enough to keep the book going. And the suspense turns out not to be suspenseful."
2,The Children of Men,One of the most depressing books I have ever come across. How can such a gifted crime novel writer write a book which could drive weaker souls to perhaps fatal dispair?Best regardsJan Ditlevsen
3,What if everyone became infertile?,"Great premise: The year is 2021, and not a single child has been born anywhere on earth since 1995. No one can figure out what's happened or how to fix it.I like James's writing style, and I really liked the first half of the book, spinning out the individual and societal consequences, mainly in England, of the end of human procreation and the impending end of our species. But then James throws in an odd twist, and the second half of the book seemed like it belonged to a slightly different novel, one that I didn't like nearly as well. Also, I didn't see the point of the shifts between first- and third-person narration.Despite feeling a bit disappointed, I did enjoy the book, but there are better novels about the impending end of the human species, e.g., Nevil Shute's ""On the Beach"" and Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road."""
3,Not What I Expected,"This book was very different than I had expected, but I'm glad I read it. As other reviewers have pointed out, the beginning seemed to drag and the main character was extremely difficult to connect with. It seemed hard to grasp that the world could have backslidden into such a mess in so short a time. Still, the concept behind the book was fascinating and fodder for some deep discussions. Just don't watch the movie... it ruins the whole thing!"
3,Dystopic Future,Differs somewhat from the Britain portrayed in the movie. Way to personaly reflective at some points. Otherwise well written.
3,good but slower read,"like the title says, but of course much better than the film. you may need to pull out the old dictionary for a word hear or there but a good story."
3,Plenty of build up but no release,The book excels at building suspense and apprehension in the reader but ultimately falls short due to an abrupt end to an otherwise captivating story.
5,I enjoyed both book and film.,This is a well written book based on a novel idea for the end of the world. Theo is a cold caracter no doubt but it is well explained that this is due to an unfortunate childhood. I can understand the apathy of the population all their hope is gone they are waiting to die nothing they do will have any effect on the future they have given up.
2,Disappointing execution of an interesting concept,"P.D. James disappoints in her book in the bitterest of ways - by poorly executing what is a tantalizing idea.Working backward from a concept to a (loose) plot, this novel seems stilted and forced throughout.The climax - wink, wink - leaves one giggling from unsuspended disbelief of circumstances, plot, andcharacters. What should have been an interesting exploration of the meaning of reporduction to a societythat takes it for granted (or, some may argue, disdains it) turns in to a brainy romance novel without the sex"
1,Boring,"Her central protagonist is a bore. Since we see most of the story from his point of view, this means we witness an incredibly interesting world from the view of a boring, emotionally stifled man. The two don't mix well.Also, this protagonist is, by his own admission, a philanderer. However, nary a sexual thought passes through his mind. And his sudden attraction to the pregnant woman is presented suddenly and without any persuasive detail.The story's pacing also gets bogged down in the description that others mention in their reviews.In other words: See the movie, skip the novel."
3,Surprisingly disappointing,"This was my first reading of a P.D. James book. I had been told that she is an exceptionally fine author - a thinking person's mystery writer. Perhaps she is but this book does not deserve those accolades. Yes, her descriptions are rich and quite lovely and the concept of the story was captivating but the characterizations were wooden, the dialogue stilted and the ending ridiculous. The early part of the book did have me turning pages with moderate interest in the situations encountered by the general population even though I had little empathy for any of the characters all of whom seemed unbelievable. Their actions and the so-called love story were even less credible. As one reached the end it seemed that even Dame James had lost interest in her story and wanted to finish it as quickly as possible with little thought to credibility, depth or grace. Disappointing."
3,An interesting--but not compelling--read,"The premise--the impending extinction of the human race because it can no longer reproduce itself--is interesting. The prospect of mass calamity, whether through disease or war, is not so remote, and James's imaginings about how human beings would behave in such a situation are the best part of this novel. However, the characters themselves are rather thinly drawn, and the plot devices for bringing the novel to a close are too apparent. The novel, however, is far superior to the film, which is pretty bad. If this subject interests you, read Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road,"" a truly compelling novel. McCarthy's style is far more suitable to a contemplation of apocalypse."
3,Something different for fans of P.D. James,"Quite a departure from her mystery novels, The Children of Men still sparkles with the usual P.D. James charm and knack for storytelling. The world of Theo Faron and his unlikely companions will make you think twice about the security of our own lives. Though a little slow at times, the characters are intriguing and you never know what sort of mishap will befall them around the bend. A successful endeavor from one of Britain's most delightful authors"
3,"Slow to start, finishes strong","Although the writer uses phrases that I wouldn't (she's British I believe after all so our cultures are different) I found this to be a good read and would recommend it to you - but STAY AWAY FROM THE MOVIE. You won't want to read it if you watch the BOOOORING movie first, if you make it through the entire thing.See my entire review at:(...)"
2,"Well, the first page was good...","Yes, the first page was good. It was crisp with a fresh idea. In fact, I remember the physical page being quite light when I turned it, though at the time I didn't realize how unique this experience would be. The rest of the pages were weighed down in the armor of needless, roll-your-eyes descriptions of minute articles to the left or to the right or above or below (this is a simulation) of the actual plot. Oh yes, the plot. I found myself scratching my head more than once thinking ""Now, would ANYONE ever do that?"" I found the characters cold and unbelievable. I found the constant departures from the original idea irritating. I was very disappointed with this book (I can't believe I got through it).But the first page was good."
2,"Interesting, but sometimes dull","I thought the movie Children of Men was interesting so I picked up the book which, like the movie, describes a world moving into apocalypse due to 25 years of the inability to procreate. Many descriptions of events in the book are vivid and full of detail, yet many of them do not relate to the overall theme or later events in the book which left me wondering why they were included at all? The beginning and ending of the book are very interesting but the middle did bore me. The book and movie both have good qualities but I think the movie would have been better if it had stayed true to the book. They had an opportunity to fix the books pacing issue but, instead, they omitted scenes from the book that I thought were critical and introduced additional social issue story lines that had little or no purpose."
4,Excellent book,"I have to admit, I'd never heard of this book before the Clive Owen movie was made. I saw one trailer and decided I wanted to read the book before I saw the movie. I was not disappointed and I can't wait to see the movie now."
4,Gritty tale of dystopian future-not the same as the film,"I will not go into great detail here as other reviewers have done that. I just want to say that the film made with the same name as the book is good but other than a few elements they are really two very different stories. I did admire the film, but I really wish that films weren't named after books when they actually have little in common with the book. See the film and read the book but don't think that the film is a good representation of the book. Both works have great merit."
2,"Promising but quickly disappointing.,","Interesting concept but the characters were not developed enough to make you care what actually happened to them. First 60% of the book was interesting enough - the main character was not to be liked, but made you want to read to find out what would happen. Then it seemed as though the author was rushing to fit this story into a quick finish. The academic seemed to lose his intelligence, the scenery and weather was described better than the relationships were built. Not a great read."
2,The Children of Men,"The premise was great, no new babies being born, the people of Earth now sterile, but it took a wrong turn. Another reviewer said it best about the ending, she wrote herself into a corner. I kept thinking about what would happen if no babies were born, how people would carry on, where all the people left would go etc. It could have great if she had developed that aspect, rather than the 5 dissidents angle. I'll try PD James again. This was a quick read, 3 days. Next up is The Pillars of the Earth, hearing great things about that."
4,good scholarship,"This is a book that needed to be written. The power of the goddess Hathor has too often been dismissed as simply a 'goddess of dance' (which she was not - dance was one of the great religious expressions in her honour, however). Her role in politics and religion have been obfuscated because of that, and the later fame of Isis beyond the land of Egypt means this goddess was somewhat forgotten. In fact, she was central to Egyptian public and private life.Alison Roberts must be commended for this work. I only wish the book had been laid out in an easier format - the three columns makes for clunky reading - and that the writer's style were more fluid. But certainly for anyone interested in Ancient Egyptian religion, this is a must."
5,Original and Fascinating,Ms Roberts provides an original and unusual insight into the feminine aspect of Egyptian religion exploring the importance of the goddess Hathor-Sekhmet. A fascinating read.
2,Off the mark,"This book does not explain religion in ancient Egypt, admittedly a very complex topic.Alison interpretes Egyptian myths in a literal fashion,pertaining to the pharaohs and their families or to cycles of nature.But,the key to Egyptian religion is that Horus is the divine soul in humans, and the various myths refer to ""his"" life cycle.All that happens in the myths refers to the spiritual development of human beings.This book shows no understanding of this meaning.Writers such as Gerald Massey, Alvin Kuhn and R.Schwaller de Lubicz give the best understanding of ancient Egyptian religion."
2,Disappointing Results,"Granted that this item is only four dollars. Thus, I should not have expected much. Each morning I would clip this to my belt to hold my keys. In the evening, I unclipped it. That is the expected usage of this product. It seemed to be just what I needed. But, after about 60 days, the leather clip broke at the place where it bends 180 degrees. The company said that if I sent the product back, they would replace it. But why pay a dollar or so to mail back a four dollar product. I will find another belt clip."
5,"Works great, does not drip!",I bought this water bottle for my guinea pigs because all other water bottles I have tried leaked and soaked the bottom of the cage. This water bottle has a spring-loaded ball to stop the water bottle from leaking and it works great!
1,Turned Out to be a Bad Idea,"I purchased 3 of these bottles two separate times (for a total of six). I raise feeder rats and I have 20+ water bottles of this size, different types. Within the first week of using these water bottles, the rats had chewed through the bottles (the bottles sit on top of wire mesh with tube through the wire). I have not lost a single bottle prior to this from chewing. I am wondering if there is some odor, or something about these bottles that tempt the rats to chew on them. Actually, positioned the way that they are in the cages, they REALLY have to work to get to them to chew on. Although the price is good, these items were not a good bargain for me."
1,Doesn't work in most dangerous way possible,"We bought these and set them up on two of our mouse cages. When we noticed all of our boy mice were acting up in their cage with the water bottle, we realized something was up. We checked the other cage with our runt mouse and found it curled up in a ball on the brink of dieing of dehydration. We managed to save it... I hope, it is currently in critical condition... but if we'd been so much as an hour later she would have died horribly.I cannot emphasize this enough: DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT! At least for mice, as even the bigger ones can't use it and the smaller ones will die from it."
3,still leaks....,We have been hunting for a water bottle that will not leak. After reading reviews I chose to order the Critter Canteen. Although I think it leaks less than others - we still have puddles in the cage so it was not the 'solution' I was hoping for.
4,"Distance, distance, oh distance!","I bought this chubby mouse to replace the Mighty Mouse that came with my iMac, which got filthy and slippery so easily.This one's great except that the receiver should be closer to the mouse than other regular wireless mice. According to my experience, if the receiver is placed more than 4 inches from the mouse, the receiver complains that the signal is too weak.Other than that, most features like motions, sensitivity, grip, etc. are acceptable and much, much better than the Might Mouse."
1,At Least It's Albert King,"I bought this DVD because I love Albert King. Otherwise I would give it 3 stars. It's short - about 1 hour - and he's only playing for about 40 minutes. I don't know why the band does a long version of Summertime without him at all. And the interviews, while good, make the DVD a little disjointed. But when you consider the rarity of King's videos, and who is playing, it's still worth buying if you are into the blues. The guy is as good a blue guitarist as anyone, ever. I have already watched it about four times since I got it ten days ago! I only hope there's more footage of him somewhere so more DVD's, preferably longer, can be produced. THIS IS BLUES POWER!!"
2,Not great,"As a Albert King fan, I found this DVD lacking. The video is poor, the song selection not great, the audio bad."
5,Excellent. Modified to work in two directions.,Handles 100 lbs and easily modified to work in two directions by bending back two tabs. Just make sure you make up your own drawer stop to keep the slides from falling off each other. I used for custom tool box drawers that were 4 inches deep.
5,great for the price.,"I use these drawer slides on a regular basis. They work very well and are reasonably priced. As always, I'll be ordering more."
5,Winning Contract Bridge Complete,This is one of the finest bridge tutorials ever written. The advanced materail on the play of the hand is very well presented with instructive examples for each. Players at all levels would benefit from this book.
4,From the cover:,"From the book:In every respect, the intercultural Bible reading project documented in this volume is a major and praiseworthy achievement. It takes various critical, ecclesial, and theological developments a significant step forward: reader response criticism, with its concern for real readers and their reading sites; basic communities, with their focus on community pairings and sustained interchange; and global Christianity, with its emphasis on intercultural exchange and a worldwide network of readers and groups. All of this by way of a focused discussion on a coordinating text-the encounter of Jesus and the Samaritan woman in John 4. This book presents a path-breaking model for future research and reading in intercultural criticism. --Fernando F. Segovia"
3,Gunhead,"This movie was Japanese and no one understands giant fighting robots like the Japanese. That said, every thing was grey. The sets and both sides of the fighting. So it was very hard to work out what was actually happening. The movie was wonderfully corney, though."
2,This one was fumbled,"Fun, overblown production design and Toho's usual level of 'special' effects should be a lot more entertaining than this.The story is simple and goofy. Some future pirates that you have to see to believe want to steal salvage (and the newly discovered element... Texmexium!) from a forbidden island with an evil computer mastermind. Lots of running, shooting, broken steam pipes and a robot brawl. Sounds like fun to me!Unfortunately it's all poorly directed and confusingly edited. It was bad enough for the director to have his name removed (from the US version at least) and substitute that old standby: Alan Smithee. Give this one a pass."
2,Rough All Around!,"This is one of the more disjointed Live Action Japanese SciFi movies you'll ever see... and for those of you familiar with their efforts in this genre, you know that's sayin' something.Stiff and doesn't move well at all - and that's just the ACTING... forget the ""giant robots"", which look like trumped up back hoes or other John Deer construction equipment... I love Japanese SciFi and I'll sit through just about anything, but this one had me looking at my watch more than a few times to see if I was coming to the end or not. How they could break it into two parts and expect to sell any copies of pt. II, I will never understand... let this translated manga alone, it's not worth your time or your money."
5,"Some may like it, Some May Not, As for me, I love it!","Bobobo is one of those Anime that gets different opinions from different people. I Know several people that have watched this show and some say it's stupid and some say it's funny. I find some of it to be stupid, but mostly it's so stupid that I can't stop laughing at times. This set comes packed with episodes 37 - 76 for a solid 36 Episode Box Set. This set does not have subtitles but does have both Original Japanese and English Dubbed Audio available.Overall, I'm glad that a company managed to fully release this series on dvd since the last company that did so didn't make it past the 3rd volume.As for recommending this product, I would advise finding a stream or video clips of this show to try first before buying to see if this is an anime that fits your style."
5,For the set it is.,"Granted, this set would've been better...for an anime fan...if the Japanese language track ALSO had some subtitles to go with it. But the English dub is fun enough and suitable for the craziness of the anime itself."
5,A TREASURE!,"I will be reading this little gem over and over again as long as there are children living under my roof~it is really that helpful! What a blessing that it is also easy to understand and in a compact format that I can carry everywhere, because truly I do. (((((HUGS))))) sandi"
5,The ultimate performer,"Great songs from a great entertainer. A singer that put his heart and soul in every song he sang. Songs like ""Danny Boy"" and ""No Pity""( in the naked city) will make you appreciated and admire his vocal range. Although no longer with us, Jackie Wilson was a one of a kind. He left his legacy, and a treasure of music for us to enjoy. I urge anyone wholove ""Real Singers"", add this CD to your collection. It won't disappoint you !!!"
4,It works.,"I was a bit skeptical when I received this pad after reading all of the bad reviews. I've only played on it for one day so far but it has been working great. I don't see much wrong with it at all. It tends to slide a little bit on carpet and sometimes you lose your place during the game because you can't feel where the arrows are. Overall, it is a low cost alternative to the more expensive mats, and once you get used to it, it's great!"
3,"Well it's ok,I like it.",Well I just bought this pad 2 days ago and it's been working pretty well I thinks it's smaller than a regular one so i have to get use to it a little.But still it is pretty good I mean even though the design is not official it is still good.But you should really wear socks when your playing on it because if you don't your feet sorta stick on to the controller.But still it doesn't matter what controller you buy just the fun entertaining experience is such a delight me and my brother both love to play with the controller.Also it's great exercise.You should definitelly buy a DDR controller and you should also definitely buy DDR you'll be hooked.And Intec this is a nice controller good job!
4,sony playstation 2 dance mat,"The mats were of low quality better to spend a little more. Would not order from this company, Gamebarginz, again as I paid for expedited shipping and received item 10 days AFTER the promised date."
4,help me,"can anyone tell me which stores has the DDR Max or DDR Konamix. if u know, please write a review.thanx."
2,Not a long lasting pad,"These pads are like most ddr pads out there: poorly constructed and not durable. The pad slides around when you play on it, and one of the buttons stopped working about 8 days after I bought it. I thought I'd pick up a cheap one since I needed an extra pad when friends came over.Do yourself a favor and head over to RedOctane.com for some quality pads. I have their Ignition pad, which is way better than this type of cheap pad because it has a cushioned insert which slips into the middle and keeps the pad from sliding around and is easier on your feet. Another friend has the regular redoctane pad with pad cover and it works great, too. Overall, don't buy the Intec pad unless you know you won't be playing DDR for very long."
1,Soft pads are for little kids and novices,"If you have any aspirations of actually becoming a decent Dance Dance Revolution player and moving up to the more challenging and satisfying songs, do not buy this pad -- or any soft pad, for that matter.Soft pads slide on the floor. They crumple and wrinkle up. They miss steps and fail to register sometimes. The surface feels the same all over, making it impossible to tell where your feet are without looking down.More advanced soft pads are available, which are thicker, but they still slide and have sensitivity problems.The only way to properly enjoy DDR at home is to purchase a metal pad. Just look up ""metal DDR pad"" on an internet auction site. Yes, they are expensive, but they'll also last for a very, very long time and put up with a lot of abuse. They also won't slide, will be extremely sensitive, and you can tell where your feet are without looking down. If you want the arcade experience at home, a metal pad is the only way to get it."
2,non-official dance pad provides bad playability,"non-offical. that word alone should prevent you from buying this piece of crud. If you were to buy any dance pad for DDR, your best choice would be to go with Red Octane, since Konami aproved it to be the best 3rd party support pad and stoped creating their own pads because Red Octane was so good. However, Red Octane is a little pricy, so the reason this pad gets 2 stars instead of one is because the cheapness allows you to buy 4 of these for the price of one red octane. don't expect this to last you a month though, and the fact that this pad doesnt even LOOK like a DDR pad makes it even worse. its confusing, and ugly. Take it from DDR masters, get red octane, or those hella expensive hard top ones."
2,Intec is such a horrible company....,"Ok...I just got the Intec dance mat yestarday so I can use on Dance Dance Revolution KonamiX. At first it worked great. And then just today, the up arrow got messed up. Well this Dance mat is good for the 1st day then after that BOOM! If you got it at Toys R us you cant get your money back for this [upsetting] mat, you can only get a exchange...Well anyway get a better mat that has be tested by pro DDR players ... Dont just go to a store and pick some [dumb] 3rd party mat. Well I guess im gonna exchange it and enjoy my game for one more day. Ill make another reviewand tell how it works after the exchange. Well really dont buy it. it [bites]."
2,This mat ...,"The Dance Mat is horrible for playing Dance Dance Revolution games. It slips on the floor alot, it doesn't last very long, and just the design is bad. You have to actually step ON the arrows to get the pressure pads to work, but they're placed farther apart than standard DDR arrows, so you'll have to move your feet differently than you normally would. Do yourself a favor and get a mat with regular arrows."
1,Worst pad ever.,"Broke the day I got it, the sewing in the lining was totally off, they just MISSED half the edges. Should have expected as much from an Intec product. Worst waste of $20 ever. I bought it as a backup pad so I could play with a friend that evening, it didn't even last the night. The foam on the inside was very bunched up and none of the buttons pressed right, it slid, and the more you danced the more bunched up it got. It's unusable now. If you don't have enough money for a nice pad, then don't just settle for this junk, it's just a waste of your money."
1,horrible,"Okay, let me tell you a little something about this item. About a year ago my friends and I had a party, and we played ddr. As soon as i started, i was obsessed! About 2 weeks later, since I already had a Playstation2, I decided that DDR would be a great thing to buy. I went and bought DDR and needed to get a mat. I got this mat because it was cheap. Unfortuneately, this pad only lasted 3 weeks. It was in perfect condition for only a week. Soon after that, the mat was so slippery when I would press the down button, it would slide so far, that the wire would unplug out of the PS2. LAter, the rubber on the wire started to peel off.It would start registering buttons when I was off the mat! IF you want to buy this mat, it will last only a week."
3,its OK,It works but it keeps on moving around and i keep on messing up because one i was using it and then it moved and i failed
2,It's ok,"This dance pad is bad yet good. For starters it is dangerous when ur on it but some it isn't. the BIGGEST PROBLEM is that it breaks easily, I had it for like wat 2 weeks then the right arrow stoped working. Also the bottom rips easily. The only thing that is good is that it is better than the Mad Cat dance pad."
1,This is not a quality product.,"Buyer beware -- If you're buying this because it's the cheapest dance mat available, you're going to get exactly what you paid for. I am just getting into DDR so I bought this to practice at home. It worked great for a couple of weeks, but now the up arrow is screwy and doesn't always register, which makes it extremely frustrating to play. I estimate I got less than 20 hours of use before it started to fail on me, which is inexcusable. In short this pad is not worth the money or trouble. Look elsewhere."
2,Okay Dance Mat...,"When I first bought this mat, it was out of stock so I guess people like this. But I would like to warn that this mat may be fun, but not at all durable. I've had it for three months before it broke. the up arrow got seriuosly messed up and hardly ever works now. The down arrow is getting screwed up too. It slipps all over the room while I am playing it and it messes up my game. :PThis mat works as good as any other mat until you've had it for a while. I've had a lot of fun on this mat and eventually, I knew it was going to break but I didn't expect it to break so soon. It's been half a year and I've never played it agian. I recomend the redoctave.com Playstation Non-Slip Dance Pads.:D It's more durable and it doesn't take you surfing accross the room."
3,please help me,"ok, i bought this dance mat today.and i have a question,if u know please write a review to tell me the answer please. ok my question is can i play the game if i just plug the dance mat in or do i have to buy something like the britney dance beat or other stuff. if u know,plllllllleeeeeeeeeeaaaassseeee write a review,don't send email to me cause i will not recieve it.thanx."
1,Didn't get the Sony Playstation 2 Dance Mat.,The order was canceled so my child didn't get this for Christmas this year anyway. I was very disappointed.
1,Software needed,Purchased this for my kid for Christmas not really knowing much about the product since it was on his wish list. I was disappointed to find out after he opened it on Christmas morning that it needed the software and it wasn't included. Unfortunately the product description does not clearly make that known so shame on both of us. Me for not knowing but Amazon (or whoever is responsible) for not making an important fact known more clearly.
4,You get what you pay for,"This game pad was lousy, it was too hard to get the pads to acknowlege if we were even doing it right. Not a good buy, would not stay straight, too soft."
1,"Game is super-fun, but cheap pads are worthless.","My husband and I recently got addicted to Dance Dance Revolution. We started with the cheap plastic foldup style pads like this, but we quickly got frustrated with them. Even the pads that are advertised as 'non-slip' tend to slide around the floor like crazy when you're dancing. This is not only annoying, it screws up your foot placement. We also tried a hard plastic version but those were really loud, hard to use, and hurt your feet after only a few minutes of dancing. We finally settled on a version that has a three-inch thick foam core that zips into the casing that houses the sensors. They don't slide around the floor, the sensors are perfectly placed and sensitive enough to register the slightest foot tap, and the foam cushions your feet. I don't know where my husband got them, but they were like $40, and totally worth it if you're going to be doing much dancing at all. I love DDR!!"
1,Breaks too easily,"I am a big Dance Dance Revolution fan and actually has a couple of these mats... These mats tend to slip as you play... meaning if you start in front of the tv when you play, after the song is done, you will literally end up stepping on the couch. Another problem with these mats is that when you fold the map, sometimes it will mess up the wiring in the mat which breaks the map. After a while, you will end up like me, with 4 DDR mats at home and none that works right. I advice either get a hard mat, or buy a square piece of wood and tape the foldable mat onto it. This way, you would not slip on it or break the wiring."
1,Don't use soft mats if you want good gameplay,"First of all, what were the people who designed this mat thinking??? It's ugly and the colors clash. Also, soft mats slip around way too much. You can't beat hard songs and it is frustrating even getting good scores on the easy songs. The response on soft mats is unreliable and unpredictable. If you want to enjoy DDR, you're going to have to shell out for the expensive hard pads. Sorry people, there is no cheap way out of this one. And don't let any seller convince you that foam on the bottom of a soft mat or an anti-slip cover will make it better, because it won't."
3,please help me,"ok, i bought this dance mat today.and i have a question,if u know please write a review to tell me the answer please. ok my question is can i play the game if i just plug the dance mat in or do i have to buy something like the britney dance beat or other stuff. if u know,plllllllleeeeeeeeeeaaaassseeee write a review.thanx."
2,"ddr rocks, but this mat is not so good","I have the Red Octane mats, and those are awesome, but I used this mat at a friend's house. Holy cow. It moves everywhere. If you don't hit it hard enough (I tap gently for the most part), you miss. You start off facing front, and then the mat moves you across the room backwards. Not conducive to getting A's. Get the Red Octane mats. Totally worth the price. Love 'em."
1,A nice idea that doesn&#65533;t work,"I got one of these because I thought it was a cool idea. I opened the box and it smelled like gasoline. I thought it would air out but it didn`t. In order to play it, you need to stand on your heels in order to not press the wrong buttons. It was almost impossible to press 2 buttons at once, plus there are no L or R buttons. Some of the other brands I tried were even worse. In short, it [stinks]."
1,Dance Mat,"The dance mat stinks! The sensors slip around. One day they work, the next they don't. We only used it one week before we started having problems. The price is great but the quality is terrible. We will not buy it again."
2,Not as good as Dance Pad Revolution!,This mat sticks to my feet! It's very uncomfortable. I would recommend Dance Pad Revolution.
1,*scream*,"First thing i thought when i opened the box(after cutting the plastic)...(its in a box, AND plastic) was man, that smells interesting. I plugged it in and to my dismay, i found that it didnt work at all. Everybody in my house went into my room and tried to get it to work, but it simply didn't. I got it for christmas and i was really psyched because i love the idea of ddr even though ive never gotten to play, got ddrmax for the ps2, a good game, too bad i cant play it. now my mom is gunna take the game and the pad back to toys r us and get a different game, thanks alot, intec. go to hel."
5,"Rubbermaid 72"" shelving unit",I have purchased several different molded shelving units but none stack up (pun intended) like the Rubbermaid unit. Took me less than 30 minutes to assemble four of them. Don't even consider any other kind. You won't be sorry.
3,Rubbermaid Shelving Unit,"Nice unit - just a bit too large for area I needed to support. Would have been nicer had it been 30"" as opposed to 36."
3,You'll Love the Rubbermaid 5 Shelf Unit,"These shelves go together in a breeze. Super simple, less than 15 mins to unpack and put together. Very sturdy, lots of space.Basic color blends in well. I only wish I had bought an extra set when I got these."
5,great shelf for $40 delivered,Didn't expect much for $40 including shipping. Shelf turn out to the sturdy and durable.
5,Ideal storage solution,"I bought 4 of these to try to bring some order to our garage. At 65, with shoulder and arm problems, I worried about putting it together. To my amazement, I was able to put all 4 of the shelves together--without help--in less than 15 minutes. No, screws, no bolts, no tools needed! Didn't need instructions! Perfect. These are sturdy, too. Couldn't be happier."
5,Oh Right!,This is a very roomy and strong shelf for it to be made from hard plastic. It is just as sturdy as wood or metal.
3,OK shelf but space is limited for footprint,"This is a decent product for the money. I've only had it for a month or two and it's not too heavily loaded so I can't speak about long term performance, but it doesn't appear to be sagging yet. The worst part is that the support posts are so thick that it limits the amount of useful storage space on each shelf."
4,Great Storage Shelf,I purchased this storage unit to organize my garage space. It was a snap to put together. Took 2 people about 10 minutes to assemble. No tools required. I haven't placed very heavy objects on the shelves. But so far it has done a good job. No tipping or shaking. What I like most about it is is that there is no screeching noise like the metal shelves when you shift things on the shelf and I don't have to worry about rust .I have owned this product for about 4 months now and am very satisfied with the product.
4,Great shelves but a little pricey,These are great shelves - nice and sturdy. Assembled in 5 minutes with the help of a rubber mallet. The only reason I gave this product four stars was that I saw very similar shelves today at Home Depot for $40 - although that may have been a temporary special price.
5,my storage shelves,"This is a wonderful shelving unit. My husband set it up in the garage for me because I had so many things that needed to be organized. It holds many things and is strong. If the floor is un-even, it might wobble a bit. We anchored it to an area to stabilize it. I advise anyone that needs storage for items to buy this. I stored my barely used items such as electric slicer, popcorn maker, food processor, throw rugs, toolbox, etc., and still have room to spare."
5,Perfect,I purchased three Rubbermaid 5 shelf units. They were easy to assemble and are really strong and durable. I recommed them highly!
2,think the Home Depot workforce shelves are better,The shelves work as described but I am only giving 2 stars because:1. I ordered 4. Each was shipped separately via FedEx and each box was slightly damaged in someway (all had opened at each end and some had gouges.) One shelf had a crack. I only kept them because I needed to get them set-up that weekend.2. I've also gotten other plastic shelving units in the past. I think the Home Depot workforce ones are nicer (they were out of stock or I would have gotten those instead).
5,Uplifting Yet Serene,"This music was played during communion. Its goal was to put one in the mood of reflection. I know 2 psyho therapists who play it when they are meeting with patients. My sister likes to listen before she does her bible study. When I am stressed out and need to calm down, I play this CD. It puts me in a place that is serene. I cannot totally express how much joy this CD gives me."
4,A Worthwhile Product,"Good ProductI've used this product for several years - normally purchasing direct from Speedwinds - 0bviously I use it because it fulfills my needs.I allowed a 3rd party to fill the order and am in the process of returning 1 of the 2 bottles purchased. The blister wrap had been torn open and the bottle was opened with the cap seal loose.I notified Amazon of the problem and as instructed contacted the seller - I was never offered a RTN label After a wait of some 3 weeks I recontacted Amazon, to make them aware.I have returned the opened bottle to the seller via UPS; which cost me over $10 in shipping.I recommend the product, but not the seller - obviously its a individual or company that doesn't respond to customers."
4,good video,This is a great video for beginners.I just learning how to play golf and this video is helping me a lot.Thank you
5,the best all-American gum ever!,"No unwrapping of 5 pieces to get a big bubble-enducing wad of gum - just rip open a bag of shredded Big League Chew! Sticking a piece between your cheek & gum is not satisfying, but pretty hilarious. Super juicy fake grape flavor is awesome and you can blow one seriously huge bubble if you can cram a whole pack of this gum in your mouth!"
2,Not orange,"These earrings are very pretty, but they are NOT orange as described. They are yellow. I was very disappointed when I got them because I had gotten them as a surprise for my daughter who wanted orange earrings, and these are definitely yellow not orange!"
1,Failed Twice,"While I like the operation, the size, the shape, etc., I don't like the fact that I've replaced it twice. Unit A1 failed and I mailed it for warranty replacment. Being addicted, I ordered another right away; figuring that it's an electronic device and [things] happen. I figured wrong. Unit B1 has now failed in the same manner. Unit A1 was replaced promptly. I'm now using Unit A2, and have returned Unit B1 for replacment. But I have no confidence. I'm buying another, different, unit. Unit B2 and probably Unit A2 can be emergency backups."
3,Find another guide,"I used this book before my trip to learn about the history, but I never used it once in South Africa. I found everyone else's Lonely Planet Guide much more helpful."
3,Sublime Rules - This Video Doesn't,"Sublime is one of my favorite bands of the 90s, so I don't want to take this space to bash the video. BUT the fact remains this video is only like 25 minutes long and 3 of the videos from the ""Sublime"" album don't even include Bradley (of course he was unfortunately deceased by that time). Plus the 2 versions of ""What I Got"" have identical visuals so don't be fooled. The footage of STP & Date Rape are both great because you can see the whole band performing. The interview clips are OK, but are very short. If you are a die-hard fan of Sublime, try to get a Bootleg video. If you just want to check them out spend your money on the ""Sublime"" & ""40 oz."" CDs instead."
2,good..but not the best,"This video is good but reeeeaaallly short. It has some halfway decent footage, but if your not a diehard sublime fan, it wont give you much in the way of seeing the band ""exposed"" or whatever. I suggest Stories, Tales, Lies, and Excagerations. It is full legnth and also has live performances and interviews and what not. But then again, if your reading this, shouldn't you be a diehard fan? R.I.P. Bradley"
2,Frustrated with poorly-fitting pieces,"The piece shapes are loose-fitting and don't make sure matches. I gave up when I had only the snowy tree limbs left. I couldn't find anything reliable to build on and was not enjoying myself. If ""Bird Watchers"" was my first ever puzzle I'd probably never want to try another one, but I'm a puzzle-lover from way back."
1,Terrible product,"I've used this holster 8 hours a day for about 2 weeks while putting up drywall and it is ready to be thrown out. The fabric where the drill handle hits it has torn halfway off and the belt loop has torn 1/3rd off. It is now more difficult to get the drill out of the holster than to pick it up off the ground, from under the arm, or between the knees. I use a Dewalt 18volt drill. Perhaps a smaller 14 or 12 volt will extend the holsters lifespan. I realize that for $7 it's going to be cheap construction, but a 2 week life span!?"
3,Tantalizing,"This fifty-minute tape contains substantial footage, all very short segments, of Omayra Amaya, who is a young woman with her own flamenco dance company in Boston. The clips are from class and performance. It contains a few precious black-and-white glimpses of Omayra's great-aunt, the immortal Carmen Amaya, considered by some the greatest flamenco dancer of all time, in performance.Omayra and other family members discuss natural dancers versus classroom dancers, tradition versus experimentation, and other topics of interest to anyone studying any folk dance tradition.A film of this length that tries to be both dance documentary and in-depth interview ends up being neither. The flashes of insight offered are tantalizing, but nothing more."
2,She can dance,"This is short but mildly entertaining because Miss Amaya can dance and they at least film some of it. Most of her numbers are not complete presentations, however. She does leave you wanting to see more of her dancing. I'm still looking for a really good tape of Flamenco and wishing the National Ballet of Spain had some of their performances on video. The other tape, ""Flamenco"" is worse than this one. So far, the VHS ""Nights in the Gardens of Spain"" and the Spanish film of ""Carmen"" set in a dance studio have the best examples of Flamenco dancing I've seen on video."
1,What a disappointment,"I thought I was purchasing a ""dance"" tape but ended up with a ""life story"" tape."
4,Won't play on many CD players,"If you buy this CD beware - a very small note on the back of the jewel case says ""This CD is not playable on computers"". Not only does it not play on computers, it won't play on half of the regular CD players I've tried it in (both new & old, various brands)."
3,The Enterprise and a Romulan War bird frozen in time,"This is a rather intruguing episode about what we consider to be the natural progression of time, and how we sometimes view it as going too fast or too slow. While Picard and company are returning to the Enterprise from a mission, Troi suddenly sees the rest of the crew on the shuttlecraft freeze. Later on, when the crew returns to the Enterprise, they notice that their ship was fired upon by a Romulan Warbird, but it's frozen in time! What will happen to the Enterprise once time is restored to its normal progression?"
1,"Warning -- This isn't the real ""Moth""","Unfortunatly, I bought this CD thinking it was from another band called Moth ...I tried to keep an open mind, but this CD was just horrible. It seemed to be something that might have had some novelty value back when synthesizers were new and high-tech, but 20 years later, it's just not listenable. Plus, the recording quality and production is pitiful.... Do us a favor an put a warning on albums when there is more than one band with the same name. This was a waste."
1,Charizard's wing broken within 24 hours,"My son was so excited to get this toy, but upon opening the package I could see that the plastic wings showed signs of stress where the wing meets the body. Sure enough, one wing broke off within 24 hours; the other doesn't look like it will last long either. And my son was actually trying to be careful with it. The other two figures are fine and seem very durable otherwise."
3,"bigger than life, is a better movie, this is alright","Basically, this movie is a documentary, it's got a lot of biggie on stage, biggie speaking with d'roc, some interviews with jadakiss, styles p, and sheek, it was alright, decent about the personality of biggie, and recomended for that reason, ,but bigger than life, is a far better documentary, it's just liver, you know? it's got more heart and soul, biggie's daughter is in it as well. the whole thing was interesting.all in all, not bad, alot of the people in the doc, without a doubt, had serious love for big poppa, esp his junior mafia, and the lox, snoop is in there as well, but the movie itself, it's a ""XXL"" must see movie, but XXL also had a part in it, and the editor in chief has a lot to say in it, three starts. bigger than life, is far superior.M"
4,"A very useful book for me, a beginer drinker.","As an absolute beginner, I like this book. It's straightforward, easy to understand. It's not pretentious as some other wine books. The most part I like about this book is that the every pronunciation of the wines and grapes are spelled out. It's very useful for someone like who doesn't know French or Italian. I wish it were on tape as well."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book is not for beginers. The author gets into things that are not important. Who cares what wine goes with cheesecake, cashews or chocalate. That's by choice. I gave the book away to the waste management company."
5,Rex Smith shines as Joe Gillis,"I had the pleasure and the privilege of seeing the Toronto cast perform Sunset Boulevard in Toronto at the Ford Centre for the Performing Arts. We had front row seats and immensely enjoyed the musical. I was amazing to see and hear Rex Smith in person. The orchestrations were beautiful!I was lucky to have recently purchased the CD. I was absolutely blown away! The music quality is superb and the voices are crystal clear. I also enjoy the London cast album, but Rex Smith makes this album stand out. His voice is expressive and magical. I personally prefer Patti LuPone as Norma Desmond. Diahann Carroll gives Norma Desmond a wonderfully dramatic quality. I only wish the full album had been recorded. The music is haunting, touching, and an absolute pleasure to listen to."
3,Falling far short,"Diahann Carroll's voice falls far short of the demands the role of former silent screnn star Norma Desmond requires. She has trouble reaching many of the notes, and is prone to speaking the parts she is unable to sing. Rex Smith is brilliant as Joe Gillis. His voice is both moving and convincing whenever he sings. The rest of the cast is average. On the whole, there are better cast recordings of this show avalible."
2,"Okay, but not great","I absolutely loved Wren to the Rescue. I picked it up in third grade, and haven't come across many books that willl eat it. HOWEVER, I was REALLY disapointed in this one. Connor's charachter undergoes a very BIG change, and many other details also mysteriosly changed. This goes also for Wren's War. Yes the plot was okay, but I think she could have put more heart and thought into this book. I also thought it was alot like her first Wren book. Tyron was turned into a dog, and Wren a fish. Hmmmm. Sound familiar? I think Sherwood Smith could have come up with new and different ways to incorporate majic in her books."

5,CT2KIT12864Z335 2GB Kit (2 x 1GB) DDR PC2700,"This Ram was perfect for my computer, just as advertised. It was shipped quickly and was easy to install. I recommend buying from this company."
5,Good Buy,I am a pc technician and needed this crucial 2GB Kit for a friends old Dell pc that only had 256MB in it. Crucial seems to have the best compatibility for Dells. So far the pc is running better than ever with no BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) problems and no memory related errors. Thanks Amazon and crucial.
5,Big Ram,"Apple says that my 1.42 Emac has a max. capacity of 1 gb. ram however after reading reviews on this matter, I have installed 2 gb. purchased through Amazon. I am well pleased with the transaction, the product and most of all the end results after installing the (2) gb of memory. The speed is awesome. Great buy, product and shipping. I would recommend this to anyone who wants more from their Emac."
5,Very Awesome,"I am very satisfied with my purchase. I highly recommend this seller to anyone, along with their merchandise"
4,Works as expected,Used this to upgrade a computer we put in our entertainment center. Moved the machine to Windows 7 and everything is running great. Good ram for the $$.
5,works in emac 1.42,"I have been using this memory for a couple of months now - no problems - in case there is still any debate about 2GB RAM being supported in emac, the answer is yes (at least it is in this 1.42 superdrive model), 2GB RAM is recognized in the system profiler - received order in 3 business days - i purchased this RAM on July 12th, 2007 for $128.63 which i thought was a bargain - today, Sept. 19th, 2007, the price is $115.19 - if you don't have to have it right away, you might want to wait and see how much it goes down - i purchased mine directly from this page from Crucial Tech. - they are a well respected company that is known for standing behind it's products."
5,ya las instale y fino.,"Le quedó perfecto al pc y prendió sin falla alguno, y llegaron en perfecto estado. Las recomiendo. Dele con confianza"
4,Worth the Buy!,"Easy to install, have had no problems with the memory chips and it has been over a year since I ordered the memory. Worth the money in my opinion."
1,Don't hold breath for shipment,"Product worked okay, but don't hold your breath for the shipment to arrive. I qualified for the free shipping, now wish I'd paid, then maybe I would have gotten the chips in a reasonable time - it took 7 days to travel from NH to MA? I can walk the distance faster than that."
3,Faster service would be nice.,"I'm sure it is a great magazine because I've had the pleasure of reading it in the past. However, it has been a month since I subscribed via Amazon and I have not received my first issue or any acknowledgement from the publisher that they even have my order."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this magazine as a gift for a friends birthday. I ordered it on Aug 9. His birthday is in the beginning of Sept. I was disappointed ""after ordering"", that the delivery date for the magazine is in OCT. Why does it take soooo long to get a magazine to the recipient! I know they say six to eight weeks...but this is WAY out of line. This is not to say that the magazine isn't excellent in content. It is a gift, so I would not be able to speak to that. But....if you order this magazine from this company, be aware of how very lonnnng it takes to receive it. I am a little embarrassed my gift to my friend is so overdue."
5,Family Tree Magazine,This is one of the best Genealogy magazines. It has been an immense help for new leads to information and how too's. A very good resource for all new and seasoned genealogists or family historians.
3,Poor Quality,"I bought this item on the strength of the other reviews for Knape & Vogt products, and have to disagree on the quality of their product.The wall attachment is painted white, and looks like a third grader spray painted it. When installing using the 3 supplied screws, the process of driving the screws in left long scrape marks in the white paint, all of which is visible through the glass. The 2 plastic end pieces have such a poor fit that I threw them away.The glass, which is weighty, is jammed into the rubber lined opening, and is held in place through friction. It seems to stay put so far, but one wonders about the longevity of the product.I expected better for the price. I'll go to Ikea the next time I need something like this."
4,Good item,This was exactly what I was looking for. The only reason for dropping a star was that the end caps do not fit very well on the wall bracket.
5,fred's about having it,james brown fanatics should get this a shame that fred wesley left over creative diffrences still there are good songs on here and if you like funk and espescially jb this is 4u.
5,Traveling in France,Contains lots of good information and pictures for self exploring this region of France. I would recommend it to friends. One of the few books with information on Andorra.
5,Best camera I have ever owned.,"I purchased this camera for a vacation to Europe. The camera was small and easy to carry. The photos it took were beautiful and even though some were taken while moving and bouncing, they all came out perfectly clear. I never was able to fill up the one meg digital card even though we were gone for 10 days. Even without the view finder that are on cameras with film, I didn't have any trouble seeing the image on the large screen in direct sunlight. I am totally thrilled with my purchase. The only negative is that I ordered a case from Panasonic on the internet and they failed to tell me that they didn't have any cases in stock (seems strange) and that it would take over a month to get. The anti shake feature is what sold me and it paid off."
5,May be the best value for compact digital 6 MP cameras,"The Panasonic DMC-FX01 may be the best value for money available now in compact digital cameras with 6 MP resolution. Optically it has a superb LEICA DC VARIO-ELMARIT f/2.8-5.6/4.6-16.8 ASPH zoom lens with a wide focal length range of 28 to 102 mm (35mm format equivalent). It also comes with an excellent optical image stabilizer that will greatly minimize camera shake working under low light conditions or when panning a fast-moving subject. I've seen elsewhere some splendid pictures taken with this great little digital camera. Those who may find its image quality inferior to other digital cameras probably took poorly exposed pictures, or were unable to use effectively its fine image stabilizer. I'm truly amazed that Panasonic has offered so much, at such a relatively affordable price."
1,WARNING- LCD screen issue on all compact Lumix cams,"Bought the camera on a recommendation, and also what looked like good specs on the web. Owned it for less than two weeks when the LCD screen cracked (below the surface of the protective cover). Turns out this is a very common problem with these cameras. Panasonic will not warranty fix this! If you do get one, or own one, be very careful not to use the left nav button. If you do, be very careful on the pressure you apply. This is the camera's glass jaw, and you might end up ""bricking"" a brand new camera. I am replacing mine with a Canon."
3,Quick summary,"Pro: love how fast it turns on, and the time between pictures. love the wide angle lens.Con: the JPEG image processing in this camera is bad. noise is way too high. this camera might be great if it offered a RAW image format, and allowed the image processing to be done on the computer. you'd do better with a 4 megapixel camera that offered a RAW image; as it is, you end up with a big, noisy picture that can not be blown up as large as you would expect from a 6 megapixel camera.Great snapshot camera, but nothing more..."
3,"Great looking, performs well, but unacceptable noise at high ISOs","After much research, I decided to go with the DMC-FX01. So after having used it at two events, which included a few indoor parties with low lighting, I'm more or less enjoying the camera, with the caveat that it produces quite a bit of noise, even at lower ISOs. While I was pretty happy with my results involving outdoor pictures and using the flash in well-lit indoor shots, I was very disappointed to notice the unacceptable amount of noise in some of the photos I took with low lighting. I'm not particuarly knowledgable about photography, but I don't quite understand why a camera manufacture would sell a device that takes unusable pictures at certain settings.So while I still like the camera, I wouldn't recommend it for the user who wants to take night shots or photos in low lighting situations. Other than this very important (and basic) flaw, the camera is a lot of fun to use."
4,Good small camera,"With the exception of low-light photos, and action photos which has been talked about in other reviews, this camera has done a good job. The wide angle is nice, gets more in the photo.The biggest problem I have had with it is that it does not have a standard USB cable. So, it will not work with the single cable that my Canon camera and my motorola phone both use."
1,Big Mistake,"I do not recommend this camera. Within six weeks of getting it, after routine usage,it died and Panasonic would not repair or replace it despite the 90-day warranty. They said the camera had sand in it. If it broke down that easily and that quickly, and the manufacturer will not stand behind its product, then stay away from this camera.During the brief time the camera was working, it took pictures that were no better than any other digital camera I've seen. Why buy an average camera from a manufacturer that will not stand behind its product?"
1,Stay Away from the Beach,"If you buy this camera, do not use it anywhere near the beach. I bought one as a present for my daughter going overseas and it broke within a few weeks. I sent it in for warranty service and was told that the warranty was voided because the camera had sand in it. They offered to sell me a new one at a price higher than Amazon charged me. Apparently, others have had problems with sand blowing into the camera - it must not be sealed very well. Customer service was rude and not at all helpful. I would stay away from Panasonic entirely. I will certainly not buy from them again."
2,Cute but so noisy!,"After a lot of research, I bought this camera a couple of months ago before I went on a trip. The camera had some features I really wanted - such as the 28mm wide angle, image stabilizer, a large LCD screen and the compact size! It looked really good on paper. After the first day of my trip, I almost wanted to smash it against the wall! The photos (taken at ISO 200 or 400 due to a rainy day) were extremely noisy - it's like nothing I have ever seen. I am no expert but it's just unacceptable! (When I first bought this it was just released so there was hardly any review; since I returned from my trip, I've seen quite a few reviews about this noise problem. Wish I knew it before!) Though the photos turned out okay (not excellent) the rest of the way at ISO 100 during sunny days, I would not recommend this product to anyone. Sure it has some attractive features, but a good camera should at least take good photos! This camera gives Leica a bad name."
4,Great for Daylight and Outdoor photos,"Camera takes great photos if out in the sun or daylight. Indoors or flash are awful from my experience. It is nice and small, sturdy and has served me well for what I like to take photos of and I have several others so this is just one for the pocket when out and about."
1,WARNINGS about this Panasonic camera,"I'm sort of relieved that my Lumix FX-01 is at Panasonic after I refused to pay $111 to have them fix my lens, which bent to the side.How did it bend to the side?See that on/off switch on the top of the camera? The entire time I had the camera it would turn on by itself since it's very easy to hit by accident. Apparently this happened somehow in my pocket and the lens bent and stuck.When I pointed out to customer service that no other camera has a switch that extends like that - and seemingly for a very good reason - they were not moved.On another note this camera is HORRIBLE in low light photography. Additionally the colors and photos were always kind of harsh without the nuance and ""wysiwyg"" quality I got with my old Canon point and shoot.I HIGHLY recommend getting a Canon instead of this. The main reason I got this Lumix was a 28mm lens, but that wasn't worth it -- especially after my bad experience with their product design."
4,xmas gift,"this was a gift for my teenage daughter. she finds it very easy to use, and loves the small size, being able to take with her anywhere."
2,Don't ever lose the proprietary data cable for this camera,"This camera takes great pictures and is very compact and portable. I've loved having it, but it has one glaring flaw which is the proprietary data cable. If you lose it, there is no universal cable you can use to transfer your pictures to your computer. You have to buy a very specific replacement cable. Not being able to get my pictures off my own camera has rendered it nearly pointless."
2,YUCK!!!,"An enchanted and fascinated-with-regular-troupe Bacchus presents Gladiator Eroticus. The flick is a parody of the big-budget cool Ridley Scott, GLADIATOR only the main lead and characters replaced by gorgeous, cosmetically shaped women. Lots of sex scenes - lousy editing - some frivolous and forced attempts in the plot to bring in sex related humor that always seems to miss the mark. It does not add up to or promise any great satisfaction. See it with a barf-bag not a box of tissues!"
2,Bad spoof,"Spoofs of this kind is sometimes nice. This one is not. Corny and very low-budget. A better spoof of Gladiator is the one by Private. It's really high-budget (relative to other features in it's genre), really good looking women. See that one instead."
1,Doesn't even deserve a rating!! These guys suck!!,"I bought one of the other flicks they made at one time. It was so bad i took it back to the store. I said it was dammaged to get a store credit and got something else. The production , acting, script and look of that film was so bad it made Jess Franco's Ilsa The Wicked Warden look like The Titanic. What really made me angry was that the flicks these guy make only shows the women topless and thats it! No real sex or anything! STAY AWAY FROM THESE GUYS. Buy a vivid movie, at least they deliver the goods!!!"
1,Gladiator Eroticus,Not sure what to say. . . kids toy outfits on adults. tried to be funny but just did not make it.
2,The reviewer from Auburn is RIGHT!,"Sorry to say, but the reviewer from Auburn, Alabama is right on the money about this film. The Seduction Cinema team has become way too enamored of their so-called humor, which is beneath sophomoric. Even more of a problem, though, is the editing: there are a number of what should have been great sex scenes, but the quick-cut choppiness of the editing removes most of the ""steam."" All in all, a disappointing offering and quite a letdown from the folks who did ""Girl Explores Girl"" and ""The Erotic Witch Project."""
1,Mole chaser as watercooler,"The company I ordered from was very nice. They delivered quickly and the product is nice looking, anyway. The problem is that the gophers involved all came out of the hole (one mom and three children) looked at it, discussed it among themselves and have ignored it ever since.I think they look at it the same way humans regard a watercooler in an office-something to gather around and discuss, but nothing to get upset over or write home about.It makes a nice conversation piece."
1,Moles love it!,"I've used this for about six months. First, the moles moved about 20 feet away, then they moved very close to it. Now they just ignore it. It's reliable; it's still buzzing away. But the moles don't care."
1,Stopped working after one day,After one day the product stopped working. I returned it and got my money back.
1,"Is this the same Jonathan Demme from ""Silence of the Lambs""?","This thing gave me a headache in the movie theater. Were it not the fact that I went with a group of great friends I would have ditched this thing after the first fifteen minutes! It was agonizing! Nauseating camera technique, unpleasant and unbelievable characters all over the place, and who the hell has weddings like these except in some liberal's all inclusive fantasy world? (And this coming from a die hard liberal himself!). What a waste of actors! And what a pretentious piece of crock. I will stop now before all those bad memories surface back up again..."
1,Long...boring...waste of time and money...,"I have loved Anne Hathaway in every movie I'd ever seen, so naturally I figured this one would be no different. However, I was HORRIBLY mistaken!! This has got to be the longest most boring movie I've ever seen. I actually skipped over most of the rehersal dinner and stopped it half way through to finish later. I had hoped the second half would be more worth while, but was not. I would have to say this is the most off-the-wall wedding I've ever seen. I think someone just took a bunch of fun ideas and smashed them all into one confusing mess of a movie. Parts of the movie would be interesting as a SMALL part of another movie. Quite seriously though, who has ""dancers"" at their reception? I can't imagine anything like that ever happening in reality.Anyway, I guess over all this was a huge let down. If you read this I hope you save your time and money by NOT watching it!"
3,"Jonathan Demme's ""A Wedding""","With an affectionate nod to Robert Altman, director Jonathan Demme has crafted a leisurely paced drama of dysfunctional intimacy. Despite its handheld-camera overkill, the voyeuristic style of ""Rachel Getting Married"" works surprisingly well. Unfortunately, Anne Hathaway is miscast as a recovering addict and avowed narcissist - lacking the necessary emotional depth to pull off this complex role. (Imagine how much better the film would have been if Ellen Page had played the lead character.) The truly stellar performances belong to Rosemarie DeWitt and Debra Winger, yet they were denied the Oscar nod that Hathaway inexplicably received. An uneven family affair, ""Rachel Getting Married"" benefits from Jenny Lumet's incisive screenplay and a fine supporting cast."
1,Unbelievably Bad!,"You know I was so incensed that I was expected to pay money to see this movie that it has driven me post a review for the first time ever. Happy to say that everything wrong with this movie has already been said by the other 1 star reviewers - it could not be any worse. From the unbelievably forced ethnic melting pot of a wedding, to the truly unlikeable characters, tedious and cliched scenes, ooh I could go on and on....this is a total waste of time - don't do it people!"
1,Don't waste your money or time.,This movie was so bad on every level. I was wishing everyone would overdose by the end. What a bunch of dreck and drivel. I can't believe this was an Oscar nominated movie.
2,2 stars to be generous,"The acting was great, but nothing extraordinary. I thought debra winger was the best of the bunch. i thought plenty of other actresses could've played Kim and done just as good if not better of a job than anne hathaway. the heavy black eye liner was a nice touch :) the most interesting thing about this movie is the suggestion that kim is not really the one at fault for her brother's death. i love that we don't know but it is only suggested during the exchange between kim and her mom before the wedding. overall, not a movie id recommend. did i absolutely hate it? no."
2,I wouldn't buy it,"The movie was not bad, but it was not too either. It was pretty boring to watch. There was no interesting scenery or anything. The story plot was good, but it was not executed in any way that would keep most people's attention. Some scenes were interesting, but not enough to make the movie watchable."
2,Great storyline; great acting; horrible filming style!!!,"I saw this movie in the theatre, and I like the story and Anne Hathaway was very good in her role; however, the filming style was so nausiatingly horrible with all the fast spanning of some of the scenes. They were so bad that one of my friends litterally got sick and had to leave the theatre."
2,"Mostly Boring, Poorly Filmed","Ok, yes Hathaway did a good job with the character. However, the movie was incredibly boring at times. 20 mins is spent on speeches at the rehearsal dinner. Zzzzzz. Who cares? 15 mins were spent on a dishwasher loading discussion. Wow. We got to watch each person at the reception dance, over and over. The music was annoying. The camera bounces constantly and zings back and forth from character to character making the movie feel like an amateur filmed it.There are only moments in this movie that are ok. Certainly not enough to make me buy it or see it again."
1,Horrible,I can't remember seeing a movie as bad as this. The quality of the picture and the editing was almost amateurish. Can't believe the Oscars and Golden Globes even considered this for an award. The only reason I gave it one star is because the web site wouldn't let this go through without a rating. It deserves 0 or negative stars.
1,Like to attend strangers' wedding rehearsal dinners?,"Then this movie's for you. You'll be made to watch long minutes of needless inaction, painful in its boringness or inappropriateness, much like in a real wedding. And I get that it was supposed to be ""home movie"" like, but really, do any of us need to watch more home videos against our will?A waste of time, but good for a laugh at how bad it is. Do yourself a favor and rent/watch Wedding Crashers for a good laugh."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this movie and watched all the way through and was really, really disappointed with it. It was a waste of 2 hours. It had absolutely no point and was super boring!"
1,cringe-worthy,"Absolutely awful. The characters were very unlikeable and it was painful to see how hard they tried to make the family seem ""cool"". Every stereotyped character was included, from the perfect, sensitive groom to the recovering addict. No plot, no resolution, no suspense."
2,Hugely Disappointing,"From the excellent reviews and decent movie commercial I was expecting something magnificent....but I got possibly the most dull and irritating movie I have ever watched. To be honest I didn't even watch the last half hour..maybe it got better,though I doubt it. This movie nevertheless does have great actors who perform well - but the characters they are playing are so utterly boring and pretentious that it just became an unbearable viewing experience. Treat with caution."
1,Don't waste you time or money on this.,"This movie is pointless, the characters are barley developed, plot lines are never resolved. This is one of the worst movies since Ishtar.The actors do a good job acting in a plot vacuum.I could go on and on but I will stop here."
1,HORRIBLE,This was the worst movie ever. I was very disappointed and didn't expect it since Anne Hathaway starred in. She's the only reason I wanted to watch it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It was very random and had no point.
1,Rachel Getting Boring,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen many horrible movies.The film is pretty much a home movie gone wrong. It doesn;t move like a real movie; everything happens so slowly that you just lose interest. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it.Now I know many will probably think I don't know movies or something like that but I appreciate well made movies, even those stuffy Oscar ones. But this was just too much. It was plain depressing. The dysfunctional family thing is cool, but when it happens in realtime it just sucks. For example, the whole wedding rehearsal dinner thing took up like a whole 20 minutes...SO BORING...even my grandmother couldn't take it!Anyways, don't buy this if you want a fun movie. Take your money elsewhere. Hathaway is much more delightful in a film like Devil wears Prada...this was AWFUL."
2,No Time for the Pain,"Sure, the acting is good, but Watching Rachel Getting Married is more like an endurance test. The whole cross-cultural music, family and friends scene feels forged and pretentious. If you are in the no pain, no gain school of ""film"" watching, go ahead. Otherwise, rent and fast forward through the cornucopia of music and meandering toasts. Too many actors have to ""prove"" they can act by playing a damaged character - now that Anne Hathaway has paid her dues, she can move on. So should you."
1,"Anne Hathaway is wonderful, Rachel Getting Married is horrible","One of the films I was the most looking forward to seeing this past year, was ""Rachel Getting Married"". From the wonderful reviews, I couldn't wait to see it. And to my surprise it turned out to be a real turkey. Anne Hathaway is far and away the best thing about this film. It is a very slow moving film, that lacks a clear sense of direction."
1,GIVE ME MY 2 HOURS BACK!,"Since I can't have my 2 hours back, I must tell you to avoid this movie at all costs. It is a dreadfully directed (I know Demme is a respected diretor) tale of past family troubles that rear full force during a wedding. No matter how good Hathaway's performace was, the rest of the movie just made me want to shut off the DVD. I cannot believe that at pre-screening this movie by all involved, that someone didn't say ""maybe we should cut out the - just shut up already speeches, pointless dancing sequences, more boring toasts and poems"" to allow more time to dig deeper into the family problems. Seriously it was about 10% acting and 90% useless material. I HATED THIS MOVIE!"
1,A Home Movie To Bore You To Tears,"If you're thinking of buying this ""home"" movie, do yourself a favor and don't buy it. I'm sure there are plenty of trash bins in your area where you can find a copy, close to new. If I could give it no stars, I would. It's like a home movie with constant chatter, and if you like watching a drama queen in action, you'll love it.This movie got a lot of publicity and with Anne Hathaway in it, I thought it would be good. Tricked again. Don't you be."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Please don't ever consider watching this movie. I know Anne Hathaway was nominated for an oscar for this movie but please don't waste your time. There are such better things you can do. Plant a tree, donate the price of this dvd to charity. Please, anything will make you feel better. I can never get back the time that i just wasted on this film. I just watched it and could not wait to complain to the world how bad it is. Actually its ending right now, my wife is watching the terrible ending, and i can still here it, oh god, their dancing. Please, don't watch it. PLEASE"
1,The worst!,This movie seems to last forever because it is that bad. The wedding dance itself lasts maybe 20 minutes. The music is annoying crap.It's a story of a dysfunctional family who like to argue about every subect that comes up in life. It gets old very quickly. If you like listening to other people argue and lousy music you will love this movie.

1,Yawner,Overly indulgent tale of a rehab girl who attends her sister's wedding and creates A LOT of non needed drama. I got through about 40 minutes before I puked all over the T.V. MY GRADE: D plus
1,sorry story of privilege,"I felt sorry for the Kym character. Everyone around her is so concerned with being totally groovy that the atmosphere reeks of falseness. It reminds me of The House of Mirth, different social prisons for different eras. And despite the unwavering allegiance to social norms, in this case, total hipness, no one will take real responsibility for one another. Kym is right, it is outrageous that she was left in charge of her brother, and she herself should have had the sense not to drive. She did, and she will be tortured her whole life in some form or another, end of story. (reminding me now of Ethan Frome). Is the screenwriter an Edith Wharton fan?"
3,"Hathaway is pitch perfect, but the movie is pretty decent","A drama about a dysfunctional family wedding that forgets to put the fun back into the dysfunctional. The wedding itself is interesting to watch, with it's intimate portrait of two uniting families; particularly, watching the rehearsal dinner is like being a voyeur - it's like crashing a private party without being invited to it. Anne Hathaway is very effective in her role as a recovering junkie who committed an accidental crime too horrendous for the family to bear. Hathaway manages to get the audience on her side and we feel not only sympathetic towards her, but we feel protective and defensive on her behalf. Unfortunately, the movie tends to drag a bit too long and one earns more for Hathaway's screen time than the rest of the movie."
1,"Worst movie of the year.. wow , disappointment","boring movie, and absolutely terrible to watch. waste of money and time. I like ann h. but why did she do this? horrible"
1,Major League Snooze-Fest!,Imagine sitting through a two hour wedding video of people you didn't know and don't want to know! Imagine a daytime soap opera as shot by a nervous 12 year old boy with a hand held Sony Handicam! On second thought don't imagine any of that and save two precious hours out of your life by skipping this snooze-fest. The high point comes when two idiots have a contest to see who can load a dishwasher the fastest. It goes downhill from there! These are truly characters you wouldn't even want to be in the same room with! I'd rather watch paint dry than sit through this dreadful thing again! Mine seems to be a minority opinion (85 per cent of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes liked it but only 61 per cent of the movie going public) but as usual I'm right. Don't say I didn't warn you!
4,Entertainment...Not So Much,"If one is looking for an light, entertaining movie about a familywedding, keep moving because this film is not for you. This well-acted but disturbing film was difficult to watch at times. It isan honest portrayal of a family dealing with unresolved issues, feelings and unspoken words as a result of addiction, that finally bubbles up at what is meant to be a joyful event. I think I would have liked to have known more of the back story and learned a little more about the characters, particularly Debra Winger's role as the mother. In so many stories, we always see the mother as the one trying to ""make it all better"". Here we see the father taking on that role. I don't know if I liked this film but definitely thoughtit was interesting and thought provoking."
1,nauseated with the movie,The camera panning is so fast and shaky that the whole family felt nauseated the first few minutes. We did not finish watching the movie. This is a terrible way to be artistic.
1,Horrible cinematography,"In the name of ""realism"" you get a movie that is virtually unwatchable. If you like gritty, unsteady hand-held shots, go ahead and watch this movie about a dysfunctional family and screwed up drug addicts. There is nothing to recommend about this movie. I would give it zero stars if I could."
1,I am still not sure why this movie was made.,"There is really not much to say about this movie other than it was extremely boring, and completely pointless and incredibly depressing. I really honestly can not figure out why anyone would make this movie or why anyone would ever watch this twice."
2,Interesting Insight WAY Overated and Low on Authenticity,"Watching this movie was difficult for me. On the one hand, it's interesting to see a 'take' on how a family copes with addiction and tragedy. I happen to know from personal experience.Some of the characters were o-kay for stereotypes, but as genuine reflections? Not so much.Especially Anne Hathaway's character.If you've EVER dealt with an addict or a recovering one (especially early on), they are no where near as 'thinking' as Hathway's character. While she did what she could as an actress, the way this character is written is poor.Honestly, I only really believed the father's character in the movie.And don't even get me started on the whole 'wedding'...way too 'fantastical' and it really diminished whatever punch the movie MIGHT have made without the extra 'window dressing'."
2,Handlheld Camera style has no place in a motion picture,"The only problem with this movie is the use of handheld camera. Home movie usually lasts 5-10 minutes and the jerking is acceptable. A motion picture like this lasts over an hour. The constant jerking, fast pan & scan, zooming too close, etc. makes me feel nauseous.A good director tells a story thru the movie. You do not need any camera tricks. Those jerking around becomes a major distraction.One way to watch this movie is to close your eyes occassionally and just listen to the dialogue... won't miss much.Too bad with such a strong cast and good story line, what could have been a good movie was spoiled by poor camera trick."
2,Only part of item shipped,"The CD is great, but no where, in the description, or in reviews, was there mention of an accompanying book. So, learning to play the 5-string banjo with incomplete information is somewhat difficult and frustrating. I found the correct book online after I received the CD, and am now waiting, a couple of weeks later, to begin my new experience.Please, in the future, add whatever might not be included in the price, then the shipping charges, which almost doubled the cost of the item, would be more palatable."
3,fantasy,"Oh, I did like the other Wren books - felt a little let down about this one. Sherwood Smith is usually a very consistent writer. This one just not quite up to par."
5,everything you need is PACKED in this book,"Everything you need in a book is packed into this book. Unusual and different characters, magic, romance, EVERYTHING. Come on, give in and read the book. The hardcover price is expensive, but it's sooo worth it."
2,A great idea botched!,"Next to Albert King, BB is my favorite blues singer/ guitist. The CD is awesome, so maybe I expected the DVD to be on the same level. Wrong! 65% of DVD is filler with comments from BB as well as other authorities such as Rufus Thomas and the smart white guy who teaches at some local Mississippi college.Where is the concert? Although the DVD gives you the option of ""playing just the music"" , you just don't get much. The producers should have just recorded the show in its entirety and the DVD would have been close to a masterpiece!Instead, they make it a documentary instead of a concert.I was very disappointed!"
3,Blues Summit Concert,"Definitely not the best quality or sound but since there is not a DVD of the original show, BB King and Friends, this will have to do. The duet between Etta James and Dr. John was and is probably the best track on the video or dvd."
3,Head Pops Off,"It's ok, but the head on my pug popped off and I wasn't very happy. Here's a warning:it may look like it's fun, but it's not strong. The chihuahua's head is ok. Just don't buy it with high hopes."
5,Durable gardening bag,"Love it!! Great organizer for me, ""the queen of unorganized chaos."" Bought two, one for me and one for a gift."
4,SCI-FI MOVIE PACK,"Just received this movie pack and very happy, received a lot sooner than I thought, I haven't watched the movies yet but I paid about five dollars for ten sci-fi movies and many of these were either on t.v. or in the movies, all pretty recent, so a great deal for the buck."
5,abe sapien's colors go great next to Hellboy by Mignolia!,"Love the detail, articulation, and accessories that accompany this item. It's definitely a great addition to any B.P.R.D comic book figure collection. My only complaint is that the figure's left leg is a little to loose making it at times difficult to pose on display, takes a little tweaking to get it just right."
4,cool toy- not super durable,Son loved it. However the toy lost his head within a few weeks of being here. It's a neat toy and I'd recommend it--just be sure he doesn't get stepped on.
5,"Oh shut up, you cry baby!","Oh, your Abe figure doesnt not quite live up to your dreams? TOO FREAKIN BAD! I have two of them; one Previews Exclusive and the regular Abe figure, and they are standing right now on my table. Before you decide to slam a figure. Why not take the time to mess with Abe's circle thigh joints. Once you rotate them the right way, he stands easily. Heck, they both stand easily. Slamming these great toys, just because you cant figue out a thigh joint. Does nothing but make you look ridiculous.These toys rule. END OF ******* LINE."
4,"""Fun and cool""","My wife and 6 year old son love the movie ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" So much in fact that our living room is filled with collectibles from the movie. Because of that, it only seemed fitting to get the game for them. I think it's funny to watch the 2 of them because my wife isn't a ""gamer"" and my son is not cooridinated enough to play so he has to watch and suggest what to do. The whole time, I have tears rolling down my face from laughter watching the two of them.As for the game quality and game play, my son summed it up pretty well when he said, ""this game is fun and cool."""
4,Oogie's Revenge,"I do like this game, although not being a real gamer there's still some things I can't quite figure out. Although I love the Nightmare Before Christmas enough to stick with it long enough to learn anyway."
4,Better than I expected,"This game expands the Nightmare Before Christmas universe in a near-satisfactory way, with gameplay similar to (but not as in-depth as) the Devil May Cry series.For a Nightmare Before Christmas fan, definitely a lot of fun, with some new versions of old favorite songs."
4,Sounds more exiting than it really is,"The music gets repetitive, and you have to run around everywhere, it's time consuming, but the graphics are awesome. There's only one save point, it dissapears when you're fighting. Bosses are pretty easy. It's a good game if you're a fan of the movie and have some spare time."
4,NBX Full Blown,"If you are a Nightmare Before X-Mas fan (like me), then you will love The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogies Revenge.The plot is that Oogie Boogie kidnaps the holiday icons (Easter Bunny, Saint Nick etc), and it is up to Jack Skellington to stop him.Through-out the game, you will have to fight numerous enemies, such as ghosts or skeltons.You also will also have to fight semi-major movie characters, such as Lock, Shock and Barrel.The game graphics are pretty decent, and the music is almost all from the original 1993 movie.Most of the original voices, like Chris Sarandon, return for the game."
3,So-so book for beginners; patterns kind of dowdy,"I didn't find any of the patterns in this book interesting except the cable scarf and hat. The how-to instructions were clear, but limited. A plus to this book is each pattern had photos for the more difficult part of working the pattern. Also the stitch library, though concise, is clear and easy to understand. This is a good book for beginners only if you wanted to practice making things you would probably not want to wear. I found the vest and tank top to be dowdy. The backpack and star hat patterns were more modern, and there were new ideas such as adding a v-neck inset to one of your shirts. You are probably better off borrowing this book from someone who owns it."
3,Not dowdy to me BUT ......,"I am currently trying to make the vest with the mandarin collar. I have 30+ years of crocheting experience and am 42. I personally think the instructions to the vest are lacking. Most instructions tell you what you are to do then give a bit of a recap of the count at the end. (ie. Sc in each chain one space then say 50 sc total) If you accidentally skip a stitch or misunderstood the directions with most directions you can count or figure it out by something else mentioned. With this pattern, if you make a mistake or misunderstand, you won't know. I figure I must have made a mistake somewhere but can't find out where."
2,difficult to follow,"I tried to follow directions for the vest on page 49 from this book and could not get past row 2. The directions were very unclear. I asked my mother to try it, and she had the same problem. Between us, we have 45 years of crochet experience, so either this book was not edited for accuracy or the writer cannot write concise directions.As for an earlier reviewer's comment that some items were ""dowdy"", I would recommend looking past the author's choice of yarn (lots of earth tones) to the bones and design of the garment. With different yarn (and clearer directions!) they might make attractive garments."
2,It's dull,"It's an okay book, but the designs are really dull and old-fashioned. I was always more of a knitter and found this book to discourage me from branching out to crocheting."
3,"Nice Designs, Inadequate Instructions","I'm in the middle of crocheting the Classic Vest, p. 49. Like another reviewer, at first I couldn't even get started. I have had help from an instructor at my local craft store (she took the pattern home and finally figured out how to start). There is nothing to let me know if I'm working correctly - the number of stitches at the end of the rows would be helpful. I don't think the designs are dowdy - I was looking for designs that were tailored and not ""cute."" There are several other projects in the book that I want to try if I finally make it through this one."
1,palm os problems,"Purchased this product for Palm OS...upon loading onto PC and attemting to transfer to new Palm with plenty of memory discovered it won't allow it to load without buying an expansion card. Customer service consists ONLY of email support which takes days to respond. Don't know yet how good the product itself is yet, but Palm users beware."
5,spider-man,This toy is cool it's so realistic because the news stand reallyhas papers in it. It's really fun when your board or raining. If your a big fan of Spider-man like me you'll love it. This is why I recommend this toy.
2,Too many sayings for which the author didnt know the origin!,"While many of the entries were interesting, too many were included for which the author admitted he could only guess, or had no idea at all of the origin. Even the title phrase, ""Heavens to Betsy"" was a complete mystery to the author. Why pique our interest and then disappoint us? I think the author had a good thing going with his first books and just tried to ""ride the gravy train"" a little too long."
1,Basically a dictionary....,"I wanted to find out why we, as a society, say such things as ""knock on wood"" or ""in one ear and out the other"". Where does that come from? Who started it? I was extremely excited to purchase this book, thinking it would not only answer my questions, but be entertaining. It was a major disappointment. I found the reading very dull. The sayings were obviously well researched, giving origins, dates, and analizations of each words meaning; yet it was more like a dictionary than a story of how the sayings came about.This book has been sitting in my bookcase since the day I bought it waiting for a rummage sale."
3,so-so,"Though the book does explain the logic behind many ""curious sayings"", many others are simply described without any real explanation. Not as thorough as I had hoped."
2,boring,"This was not as fun as I expected. Difficult to read, small print and not interesting topics. I dont reccommend this."
4,Heavens to Betsy,Good but not overly concise book of old-timey espressions - learned a lot with this one! Wonder if we know what we're saying sometimes.... Fun gift book.
2,Fifty Years Out Of Date,"I consider myself a ""wordie"" - love to hear about interesting word origins and the like - and so was very happy to see this book at the used book store. After reading it, however, it is going back to the used book store. Parts of it were okay, but nothing was especially earth-shattering about it. And, most unfortunately, so many of the entries were expressions that only my grandfather remembers anymore that it was more or less irrelevant to me. I suppose there's a quirk factor to the book, and perhaps it would be useful for someone wanting to write a book set in the 40's or 50's, but there are many better books to buy if words are your thing."
1,a very confusing read,"I had to stop reading this book about halfway through because there were so many things left unexplained. For example, on page 71, it states about Xlink:type that ""There are two possible links: simple and extended."" and procedes to briefly explain what these are. Then on page 73 there is a sample XML document containing Xlink:type=""arc"". So, I'm left wondering, if there are two types of Xlinks, where did ""arc"" come from. The answer, of course, is that there are not only two possible values for Xlink:type, but you won't find that explained in this book. If you really want to understand XML, pass this book up."
2,Not Impressed,"As a newbie to XML, I was really hoping to use this book for an overview of the language before diving into meatier texts; however, I found the brevity of the book to be too...brief. I spent a good deal of time looking up additional references to get a better picture of what XML can really do."
2,Definitely a First Edition Book,"An easy weekend read that touches on a wide range of XML topics, but typos in the book confuse rather then reinforce many of the concepts."
4,hardships of women in the civil war,i think that it is very touching and it will inspire many to read more about their history to learn more about it and the people who lived back then.
5,An intriguing & conceptual reinvention of America in the 1850's & one young woman's discovery among great intellects of the era,"Rachel's Story: A Southern Girl In Pre-Civil War Boston by Mariana Coe is an intriguing and conceptual reinvention of America in the 1850's and one young woman's discovery among great intellects of the era. Including Elizabeth Peabody, Henry David Thoreau, Louisa May Alcott, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, Rachel's Story is an intriguing and knowledgeably written novel of what would most certainly have been a life many might now be envious of. Rachel's Story is very strongly recommended to all general readers and transcendentalist enthusiasts for its intuitive and intriguing conceptual work of historical fiction."
4,Making cards,The girls liked this very much. There is only one problem and that is that it sticks. I did not send it back as I needed it for camp projects as soon as it arrived so was stuck with a sticky punch.
1,Not Cold Climate Gardening,Zone 5 is not cold climate gardening! Book is a waste for those who truly live in cold climates.
3,glasses,"they're smaller then I thought they would be, so I wasn't happy about that. Still, I could use them properly."
1,Cheap glasses,Was pleased with product until the glasses broke with the tag still on it. The bridge of glasses very thin and cheaply constructed. Attempted to glue but not sturdy enough to wear. This was a waste and I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.
1,Cheap & Cheap,These were very inexpensive glasses. They were also very cheap. I didn't expect much out of them due to the price however they were even small my my 6 year old sons head.
5,Fascinating Subject,"I am an a electrical engineer who has usually followed a very western medical science oriented view of health and fitness. I became interested in meditation and breathing becuase of the death of someone who was close to me. I bought this book, originally because I was interested in self healing. What I got out of it was a much stronger sense of who I am and and what I am doing with my own life, in addition to healing. Mark Rich gives a much bigger picture of who we are and how we function energetically. There are other books out there on this subject but this one seems to be written very matter of factly and straight to the point. I can relate to that! Highly recomended!"
4,Carlos Castaneda Vindicated,"After all these years, Carlos Castaneda's description of the human energy system is vindicated. It rang true with me then, and it has now been scientifically and experientially explained. This author not only practices what he's teaching, but he can bring it down to a layman's level of practical visualization and application. Each exercise is safe, simple, easily understood and workable. It does not mean that the results are necessarily easily or quickly obtained, but the means to reach the goal of self healing and shared healing are there. If practiced, his book has the potential to substantially enhance your energy, healing and ability to exchange, recharge and dispense human energy selectively and consciously. A good read for all things visual and practical concerning human energy."
4,"Great, but you'll need someone to work with",To really use this book the right way you'll need a partner to do the exercises. But besides that it's a great book :)
4,Super Fun,"Great gadgets gizmos for the doer. If your interested in learning and building the projects in here. You most certainly will be a captive audience. You better be motivated, its not just for reading."
3,Some good basics for tinkering.,Nothing earth shattering but there is a few fun projects for those inclined to tinker a bit.An inexpensive publication and worth the price.
5,A Great Love Story: Moving and Uplifting.,"I have just finished reading SILENT WING, a great love story. I found the novel to be very moving and uplifting. In addition, the love poems in SILENT WING are wonderful! Last year I read Bernardo's THE SECRET OF THE BULLS, which I also loved."
3,Rebel Without A Spine,"The book seemed like a novel that was expanaded from a TV drama pilot outline...The characters other than Julian were never delevoped and what happened to all the characters in Guatamala? The General, the Rabbi and most all Rubios. This is a case where less is not enough. Perhaps with another 200 pages, this could have been a different historical novel."
2,80$ expected more!,"well ive ordered several mats for diffrent rides ive owned along the way...first coming to mind was a 96 saturn sc2..paid like 60$ from saturn for there trunk mat it was 1000 times better then this...nice thick rubber mat with nice raised edges""lip""..i wanted this cause occasionly i carry gas cans for the boat in my suburban and with the vent tubes opened it can seap gas from time to time..this thing is THIN and barely any lip id say 1/4"" not impressed for 80$ if a quart of milk leaked it wouldnt even hold that while driving!"
1,NO truth in advertising here !!!,"NO truth in advertising here !!!I believe this advertisement is a LIE !!! And I quote from it:""This version of the 17-inch MacBook Pro has a display backlit by lightemitting diodes (LEDs),This version of the 17-inch MacBook Pro has a display backlit by light emitting diodes (LEDs),""I just checked with The Apple Store. Inquiring on the MacBook Pro 17"" with LED display. And their response was, ""THE 17"" WITH BACKLIT LED HAS NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED AND IS NOT AVAILABLE"".Are you people inept, stupid ,,, or simply cunning LIARS ???"
4,used for Jam/Jelly labels,"This label was about what I expected. For some reason, even with the Avery template for Word, I never can get my labels to print correctly. I don't know if that's user error or something else........ I used the labels on small mouth Kerr and Mason jars when I canned this summer. I found some really cute templates online and converted them to the Avery template. My only issue is with the printing of the labels... the first few would line up but by the bottom they were all out of wack! Like I said, don't know if it's user error or always happens but I couldn't fix the issue. The labels are a little larger than I really wanted for my small mouth lids as the edge went under the ring but they worked just fine. On large mouth they look perfect (if you can get them to print correctly!). When I run out I will definitely order more."
2,old labels,"The labels were what I wanted as far as style number but they were old, and simply not used to the intended purchase."
4,"versitile, be creative with it","had no problems with the product. easy to handle and apply. Combined with the Avery Design Pro software, was able to create a usable and functional items quickly."
3,"Outdated, but okay","An easy-to-read book that draws upon mothers' real stories about incest within their families. The author weaves together the stories of six women and highlights their experiences before and after discovering the incest. The book is somewhat dated as the author carefully explains how these women do not fit the mold of being collusive or powerless within their marital relationships which was the generally accepted model in the late 1970s. The most potent aspect of the writing are each woman's story told in her own words. The common denominator for all the women was the since of betrayal from their partners and how incest shattered the foundation of their lives. The author revisits the women six years after the initial interviews and relates how recovery is possible and even beneficial. As an incest victim, you may find solace, grief, or anger written between the covers of this book. As a mother of an incest victim, you may discover that you are not alone."
4,Nice change for the lotion haters and for allergic folks,"Although I normally prefer the Kleenex brand, these Puffs are fantastic! Plus, the colors are great so you don't mind them sitting everywhere during allergy season like we have to do. Better even yet, when the cats sneeze, they're fantastic to clean their eyes and noses too (Persians do that, weird, huh?). These are a much thicker tissue and absorb all the moisture you can dish out without ripping your nose off in the process. To me, the true test of a tissue is how long it can survive in a purse unprotected. These made it a record 2 weeks without shredding. Great product, highly recommend!"
1,SMELLED LIKE PERFUME!,These smelled like perfume and I could not use them. I'm allergic to chemicals and had no idea they would have a fragrance. I called the company and they should have had no fragrance. They must have picked it up in an Amazon warehouse or something. I was very upset with this purchase.
4,Excellent storage for mini discs,good way to chronologically store your mini discs. they sometimes slip out if they are tipped upside down.
2,old times there are still not forgotten,"I picked this up as I hadn't read all that much previously on General Hampton. I found the book surprising as the author is a South Carolinian and something of an apologist for the Confederacy, not something you see in most modern Civil War histories. The book is as much about his post Civil War political career as the governor of South Carolina as it is about his war time exploits, although those were considerable. The author is clearly no fan of the Reconstruction period either, but he does make a valient effort to make Hampton into something of a racial moderate, at least in comparison to his contemporaries. However, given South Carolina's troubled racial history since the Civil War, I found it hard to admire Hampton's success in overcoming the Yankee occupation."
1,Neo-Confederate Retelling,"With respect to the other reviewers in this forum, I must disagree with their positive impressions of this book. Cisco's book is strictly for the neo-Confederate reader. True, Hampton is in real need of a biography--there are basically three: Manly Wade Wellman, Giant in Gray, 1949; Ed Longacre's, Gentleman and Soldier, 2003; and Cisco's version. The best of the lot, Longacre's, is war heavy, and the other two are biased to a Confederate view. Indeed, Cisco's book can not be taken seriously by academics or even serious students of history with such outlandish comments that, ""During the war many Southern blacks stood by their country--the Confederate States"" (p. 170) Or, that Hampton ""treated slaves as individuals and fellow human beings."" (p. 41).This book is poorly written and ignores Hampton's role as a Redeemer and slaveowner. Hampton, and the reading public, deserves better."
3,The Parade,"An interesting sequel to the movie ""Picnic"" by William Inge written by his friend N. Richard Nash, best known for ""The Rainmaker."""
4,Easy to use,"Once you download the template, these labels are quick and easy to use. They work perfectly for branding your products!"
1,Junk - don't buy,"Material was flimsy. The ""neck"" was super-hard rubber material that wouldn't fit over an infants head. The ""see-through"" cloth was about 3 inches tall and could barely cover my sons face after forcing the neck over his head. Ended up cutting out large ear holes for the ""neck"" to fit."
1,Not easy to wear and uncomfortable,"My 7 year old was really excited to be a headless horseman for Halloween but this costume was impossible for 2 reasons: first the child has to wear these blow-up shoulder pads so that the costume ""shoulders"" elevate above his head and the rubber stump mask lines up with the shoulders - these shoulder pads are junk and my son was really uncomfortable (and he was trying really hard to make it work). Secondly the child does not have any way of easily seeing through the costume once it's all assembled. It wasn't safe and we couldn't see him wearing this all day for his school festivities plus an evening of trick or treating. In the end we modified this to a vampire outfit."
2,Hard to fit,"My son enjoyed being the Headless Horseman, but the costume didn't fit very well, the shoulder pads were difficult to keep on his shoulders and the costume didn't come up high enough on his face. He still had a great time trick or treating though! And he was the only Headless Horesman that we saw."
1,Great picture...bad costume!,"This was the best costume my 10 year old son had seen for Halloween 2010, so we ordered it. But, what a disappointment! The ""neck"" is a mask, to make it fit, he had to compromise his ability to breathe thru his nose. The costume part has a thin piece of see-thru material that covers the mask and we couldn't get it to stay up over the mask. And, there are blow-up shoulder pads that are connected with 1/4"" elastic that were too tight under the arms and too big across the shoulders. The costume is cute in the pictures and the idea of it is great, just didn't all go together as well once we got it home. My son had to wear a costume from 2 years ago at the last minute, not a happy moment, but oh well!"
3,Hmmm....so so,"I was a little disspointed in this costume. Not so much for the quality but for the way it fit. I ordered it for my 13 year old who wears a size 12-14 but it was a pretty snug fit. The shoulder pads made it even more uncomfortable by increasing the tightness around the shoulder area. The mask fit was also a bit snug. All in all it is a cool, creative and original costume if it is the right size for your child. If your child truly wears a 12-14 in street clothes I would not recommend this costume because that size in this product seems to run a little smaller. Unless your child is on the smaller end of this size range. Then it may work."
5,A Little Different from the Standard Christmas Fare,"I have three children, ages 8-19. After a certain number of Christmases, I realized that most Christmas stories (in books & on TV) have a similar plot line: the main character overvalues presents/material goods, learns presents don't matter, & then is rewarded with... a present! In this book, Herbie is a bit too into food, which leads to a lie, and then Herbie has to redeem himself, but at the end, he & Lottie celebrate by enjoying the wonder of the world itself.My daughter (8) & I have loved Mathers for several years -- both her quirky tales and her art. On the surface, her art seems quite simplistic, but as you read her books again & again, you catch little details you hadn't noticed at first."
2,Hunter fails again,"There are many finer editions than this. G. K. Hunter is one of the least penetrating and dullest commentators around. The older critics, from the nineteenth century, are superior. The moderns' erudition is artificial; they don't live religion or classical culture. Hunter is one of the worst. Avoid."
5,Diva LaBelle on stage,"If you've never been to a Patti LaBelle concert this is as close as you'll come to getting the full experience. Patti throws down in this concert like you wouldn't believe. Singing songs from her standards ""On My Own,"" ""If You Asked Me To,"" and ""Lady Marmalade"" to cover songs of Aretha Franklin's ""Ain't No Way"" and Whitney Houston's ""All the Man That I Need."" Don't forget the magical moment when Patti's former group, Labelle, takes to the stage for the first time in over 15 years. And you will not believe what this grand diva does with Somewhere Over the Rainbow. If you can watch this tape and not hail Ms. Patti as one of the greatest stage performers ever, honey, you must be dead!"
5,Pleased overall,"This product works well. It takes a little longer than conventional cleaners to break up hard water marks but it cleans completely and without a strong smell. If you are concerned with reducing chemical fumes and water pollution, this is a safe and effective choice."
3,Earth-friendly but poor performer,"This line of products may be helpful in protecting you and the environment from waste and chemicals, and I won't comment of the value of that.The trade-off is that the product doesn't really perform all that well. It doesn't remove iron stains (rust) or even kill mildew all that well, but that's not normally a toilet bowl problem.But the balance between the two considerations is up to you."
2,All wrong,The author has one very good idea and that is that Shylock is masked. But all of his conclusions are the result of a dominant culture reading. They are superficial. I would not recommend this book for a deep understanding of the subject.
4,Not Ellison at his best... but still Ellison,"Spider Kiss is a novel about a rocker 2 parts Morrison, 1 part Elvis, 3 parts Jerry Lee Lewis. While to a modern reader it might seem a bit trite- we should remember that the archetype of Rock & Roll Musician was only just being formed when the novel was written.Stalking the Nightmare, on the other hand, is a fantastic collection of Ellison short stories- with a brilliant introduction by Stephen King- and is one I've recommended many times to friends. Having this back in print- in a hardcover that will actually survive a bit of abuse- is certainly a treat."
4,Classic Disco at it's Best!,"This 3-track maxi cd single includes the songs: 1) Come on and do It, 2) Boogie with Me, and 3) You're all I Have. This is a nice collection except why the song ""Never gonna say Goodbye"" was left off this single is beyond me. It was probably the best song Poussez ever did! Too bad or else I'd have given it 5 stars hands down. If you enjoy euro 70's disco with women moaning in ecstasy and lush strings as well as nice female vocals than this is for you. Those who enjoy listening to Cerrone's ""Love in C Minor"", Love & Kisses ""I Found Love"" or Alex Costandinos smash hit ""Romeo & Juliet"" will love this. Recommended for only disco classic lovers!"
1,Wait For The Domestic Re-Release,"Don't bother with this rip off Import. Look for the domestic release (US) of the orginal LP plus a bonus track of the 12"" promo copy of ""Come On And Do It"". Due out in March of 2005 on the label ""Get Disconnected'."
3,NICE YET FUNKY DISCO!,"I haven't heard POUSSEZ'S songs since the 70's until I started listening to WKTU.NY(STUDIO 54).When I heard ""COME ON AND DO IT"" I knew that I had to add that song to my disco collection!Actually,it's my favorite song of the girly group.""BOOGIE WITH ME"" is okay and ""YOU'RE ALL I HAVE"" I'm not crazy about it (that is why I rated this cd 3 stars.POUSSEZ reminds me of SILVER CONVENTION(GET UP AND BOOGIE) when you hear it you will agree. ""COME ON AND DO IT"" is a funky,raw,sexy and nasty kind of disco song like ""HEAR COMES THAT SOUND AGAIN & ""PUSH PUSH IN THE BUSH"" combined.I like raw,funky,rare and original disco music with a pinch of euro-flair mixed in so I am not sure if everyone will find this cd worthwhile.For it's reasonable price, I don't feel too bad for getting 1 song that I really enjoy than spending $16.99 elsewhere."
2,Come On and Do It,The version on this CD is not the remixed version heard on Disco radio stations and clubs in 1979. It has the mood background sound deleted in this version and sounds a little boring.....
1,Very Disappointing Film.,"Viewed: 10/11Rate: 210/11: So, I guess what the film was saying is that the twins were a good people and we must look at them at a different perspective. *yawn* Yeah, right. The Krays is one of the most poorly directed films I've ever seen in my life. The scenes are so stupid that each of them had so little meaning into it and has no connection to the next one. Is the movie supposed to be about the women? Or about the twins? It doesn't make any sense to me. Originally, I thought I was going to see a hard hitting gangster film in a cold blooded fashion, but no...it's just a lot of women talking with a gratuitous violent scene interspersed throughout it. The story portrayed on the film is very inaccurate and glossed over. So, it becomes pointless. There isn't even a structure to why the twins became feared gangsters in England either. All in all, The Krays is a highly disappointing picture."
2,"The ""KRAYS""",I only can watch this on my computer. Why wasn't I made aware it would'nt play on my DVD player before I purchased it?
3,Entertaining.,Movie was fine. I guess I see too many to say this was extroadinary. Worth a watch for history sake.
2,And Out of the Egg Hatched Two Twin Boys,"I was not familiar with The Krays before watching this film so my view and knowledge of them is rather limited. From what I gathered of the film, The Krays were twin brothers who were very competitive and violent. Their mother spent her time praising them, bringing them food, and encouraging them to aim high. One brother is a homosexual, the other hetero. The wife of the hetero goes insane when she loses herself in the job of being a gangster's wife. She could not take the scrutiny from others. It does not pay to be with gangsters. All the important women in the Krays' lives died. The Krays are totally into human torture to show their precedence over everyone else. All in all, the Krays are not very nice people, but their mother still thought they were perfect."
2,"Kultur, this time you missed it!","If you are interested in the (ever fashionable) approach to Jazz, via the contemporary interpretation of the social environment in which the Jazz artists created, then there is a good chance you may like this DVD.However, if real footage is what you are after, this DVD may well disappoint you too. In this latter case I strongly suggest you spend your money on ""The Ladies Sing the Blues"" DVD.Being interested in a combination of real footage and adept commentary I got disappointed on both ends. In the whole DVD, there are at most three incomplete songs where Lady Day actually sings, yet there are a few too many (poor taste) instances when her voiced dubs some disconnected Jazz players/dancers. As well, in addition to some general socio-historical vignettes, I found the commentary to be just a suite of encomiums with no critical side to it."
2,Stiff and Uncomfortable,"Although it carries the Grizzly name, I cannot recommend this as a good woodworkers apron. It is too stiff and tends to ride-up when you are bending and kneeling.The overall construction is good and it does hold the tools well. However, a cloth apron is what I use now."
1,Bad quality apron,"Don't buy this apron!!! The one I got from Grizzly only last for 10 days, it just tear up when I bending or kneeling down, I'm very very very disappointed."
4,"Good product, arrived on time.","The Grizzly Finish Carpenters Bib is a handy tool, much better than using a belt. I only have one issue with this - that the back connection does not hold the bib as securely as a belt, and allows it to drift away from your body when you lean over some work.It is still a very handy bib, and I have not found any other that works as well. Would recommend this product to others."
2,Not so great as expected!,"Thought it would do a great job steaming away dirt and oil film on the kitchen floor. Yes, it did, but require a lot of scrubbing, and the tiny scrub head that it came with is hardly enough to do any substantial cleaning. Only good for small spot cleaning. The container is small and runs out very quickly. The carrying case is flimsy. Its base piece of plastic is pratically in confetti bits when received, which means there is no base for the bag. The bonus sweeper is weak, not even worth the electricity to charge it."
4,Entertaining,"Not up to par with the Disney classics, of course, but entertaining enough and of decent quality. Good for students learning Spanish.My 3 y.o has watched it several times even though he's not into horses, so I guess he likes it well enough.I would say that girls would like it better."
2,a dreadfull schoolgirl account,"This book reads like a dime novel in search of a discount. Facetious, petty and juvenile. It will soon end up rightfully in the 70% discounted bin alongside autobiography of Dick Cavet"
1,"Actually ""0"" Stars","This book is not worth buying or spending time on. I have read several biographies on Jane Austen and some phrases of the book seem directly lifted from these. Besides this, it is sloppy with inappropriate word usage such as ""bitchy"" to describe Austen in one paragraph. One would think a biographer of Jane Austen would be inpired to write with as much polish as one could but this biographer seems to have written with haste and little depth of thought."
3,Just a set-up for a sequel?,"As others have noted, this book felt more than a bit rushed; it dropped certain long-running plotlines on the ground and skipped on a lot of the characterization that Brin usually does so well. While I was hoping for a proper conclusion to the Uplift story, this seems more like it's angling for another book (or series) set in the same universe. I don't expect everything to be wrapped up tidily, but at some point I'd like to read a definitive conclusion!"
3,Is this a record...,"...for loose ends? I lost track of how many unfinished subplots there are in the six books in this series as a whole. I guess it's artistic in a way to end a book with so much unfinished business leaving the rest to the reader's imagination or guesswork, but in the case of this book (actually two as it is really a continuation of Infinity's Shore) this is deeply frustrating.Pity, because Brin is a fine and hugely imaginative writer."
1,An unsatisfying conclusion to an unsatisfying trilogy,"A contrived, childish plot inflicted upon annoying, shallow characters. Filled with endless repetition, failed metaphors and similes, that beg the question ""Did anyone bother editing this book prior to publishing it?"". Where almost every chapter ends in a mini-cliffhanger, and the same patterns repeat over and over and over, but just get bigger and bigger and bigger, trying to fill the reader with wonder, but going way over the top, failing miserably. Leaving, predictably, the door open to yet another sequel, trying to squeeze another buck out of earlier success. While that may be the case, I certainly won't be contributing."
3,Am I Missing Something?,"First, I haven't finished the book....but I will. I just want to know one thing. In what novel or short story did the escape from Kithrup appear. Did I miss a book that had the Streaker in the Fractal World? I buy trilogies in their entirety because it's hard to keep up with plot lines over time. Here, and in Infinity's Shore, there is exposition that refers to what happened after Streaker escaped Kithrup. I feel like I missed an entire novel. Where is it? And if it doesn't exist, it should. Having vented, I would say that so far (page 206) this story is a long way from the riveting character development in Startide Rising and Brightness Reef. I'll finish it because I have to. But I still feel cheated because there is something out there I feel I missed."
2,Galaxies Lost and so was I,"This tangled mess went from bad to worse. Brin wasted all of the character interpersonal play to set up this grandiose galaxy lost/exploding crystal sphere finale. The Sooners kids & Streaker crew sure didnt receive great endings. And after all that, Earth didn't get to cash in on Streaker's discovery"
3,"grand, but not what I expected","I think it is grand to have quantum physics, space /time mathematics etc in this book. However I agreed with quite a number of reviewers here in the sense that it is not "" human "" enough. In contrary to many critics here I found the first two books of this 2nd triology interesting. It explored possibility within the law of uplift with many interesting characters. However all this lost in the ""grand"" design in the third book. I am especially disappointing to find that the plot is very different from the style of the 1st uplift triology. The siege against earth ended so abruptly that I read that chapter twice to make sure that I did not miss some important twist in the plot. I won't say that this book is poor. It is just so different that people like me who love the previous 5 books may find this last one not their cup of tea."
3,Rushed and somewhat unsatisfying,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who thought this conclusion was tied up in way too much of a hurry, and lost a lot of the ""fun"" in getting there. There were good points, but there were some pretty severe lacks.The ideas were there, and they were taken to a logical (in this universe) climax, and the ideas were as fantastic as they should have been, but the characters had lost their reality and personalities. This is especially true of the ""Streaker"" and it's crew. It did in truth become nothing more than a ""vehicle."" In the end, I thought the whole climax was rather sterile and pointless.I hope that the Streaker and it's crew regain their spirit, sense of wonder, and most importantly, thier sense of fun in the next phase. Perhaps they can redeem the sterility of the culture they left behind.David, a title for the next book: ""And the Hoons Shall lead them!""?"
3,The weakest in the series,"I could not get enough of this series, and eagerly looked forward to each new book as it was published. Then this one was released and the whole story seemed to fall apart. It just didn't fit for me - I should have stopped at book 5.Brin seems to have rushed through the later parts of this book, and not taken the time or attention to detail that the earlier books had. Perhaps if it had been spread out into two books, it would have been a more fullfilling read."
3,Disappointed,"I love the Uplift universe. The last two books in this 2nd trilogy have been a disappointment, however. They don't seem to be thoughtfully written. As one reviewer noted, they seem to be dashed off. I am very, very tired of the literary ploy where each chapter is ended at a moment of crisis, and then the next chapter starts up with a different character, particularly when, when the characters in crisis reappear in a later chapter, often the crisis is not taken up where it left off; indeed it seemed that at least twice the crisis wasn't even refered to in retrospect, which astonished me. This stylistic ""technique"" gave me a headache."
2,Sadly it all falls apart,"This entire book suffers from David Brin's worst fault. In my opinion David Brin is a fantastic author, who creates vivid, new ideas or tweaks old ones in a new way. His only fault, in my humble opinion, is his tendency to end a book very quickly.This novel I believe is the ending to a series and has a long line of events that make little to no sense. The book moves away from the planet Jijo and into outer space. Although being back with the Streaker again from ""Startide Rising"" is fantastic, its confused wanderings across the cosmos have little purpose. Additionally the characters that once illicited interest both on the Streaker and from Jijo are suddenly uninteresting.Overall I found this an unexciting conclusion to a series that had great premise - the conflict arising on Jijo seemed truly thrilling. All of Brin's other books I have read are truly worthy works, this is just a sad failing."
2,"OK, but not nearly as good as the first Uplift trilogy","I read the entire second Uplift trilogy, but only because I have a completion compulsion. This made good commuter-train reading, but it was a disappointment after the first Uplift trilogy."
4,Rushed but worth it,"Heaven's Reach is an enjoyable conclusion to the Uplift Stormseries, but the author tried to pack too much into this last volume,and the story was hard to follow. (Maybe I read it too fast, but Ifelt like I was in ""E space"" for the last third of the book...)Minor complaints aside, I couldn't put Heaven's Reach (or any of the others) down. If you made it through Sundiver, don't worry, you'll like it."
2,Not a very spectacular finale to an otherwise great story.,"I my opinion D. Brin is unable to maintain the strenghth of the two previous novel in this third. He trys to wrap up the entire ""Uplift"" story-line in the last 6 chapters of this novel. By this time he has expanded to far out to be able to bring the conclusion to a concise ending. He looses control of the story in the end and try to cover this up by bringing in delusions. He should go back and re-read ""Startide Rising"", then rewrite this last novel along those guidelines. I was very disappointed with this final novel of the trilogy. The two previous were good, but this final one is very lacking."
2,The final volume of the Uplift Trilogy falls flat.,"I really enjoyed the other books in Brin's Uplift universe, Startide Rising, The Uplift War, and the 1st two volumes in the current trilogy, but this book falls flat. In the 1st two volumes, Brin gives us characters that we care about in fascinating situations. I could hardly wait for the conclusion, and now I wish I hadn't read it. While it has many fascinating concepts, it does not have the intensity of the other books."
2,As low as 2 stars? Here's why.,"Don't get me wrong. Heaven's reach is not a total failure in itself. It took me a while to understand why I was so disappointed when I finished the book. I can only agree with reviews who say the ending is Grand. But that's not the point. The real problem of the book is, the ending has nothing to do with the rest of the uplift novels. With what's in this book, Brin could have written (should have written) another uplift line. The book just does not belong there. Everything Brin has ENTITLED us to expect from the previous books just isn't there. I wanted to read more about all the wonderful characters who had been so well developed that they had become my friends and my foes. I wanted to know what happens to them, not what happens to the universe. Might it possible to ask David Brin to rewrite this third book, as the first two were so wonderful?"
3,Bought the hardcover. Should've waited for the paperback.,"Dear Mr. Brin, I loved this series and was therefore disappointed with the final entry. You did seem to be in a hurry to get this one finished. An editor would have been useful (or a better editor). There's lots of repetition throughout - who the Old Ones are, who the other Old Ones are, where the Old Ones are, where Herbie was found. Blah, blah, blah. More characterization, less explanation. I love aliens as much as the next person but please have some self control. The power of possibility dissolves with excess diversity. Next time try to limit yourself to one 800 page book please and maybe 15 different civlizations. I'd save a little money and you'd be spared all that extra typing."
3,Brin's trademark characters lost in the shuffle,"Though I'm an avid fan of this series, I felt Brin's ""Heaven's Reach"" rushed to a conclusion full of theory and potential but without the charm of his characters. He spent a great deal of time developing unique and interesting places and peoples, only in this book to make them quantifiable values in some grand statistical scheme. The force of his ability to draw characters is lost in his attempt to describe life forms that by definition have lost all character. Further, characters must make leaps in knowledge without ever being wrong in order to move the plot along. I would have prefered a greater focus on the station where Harry stays when not in E Space, or what exactly was that Herbie character, or what happened to Tom Orley...or Earth during the seige for that matter."
5,Drawer Slides,Box received nearly open due to insufficient packing of heavy items in a too large box. Good heavy duty drawer slides that work well. Too bad there were no instructions with ANY of the several I ordered.
5,EXCELLENT QUALITY AND PRICE,I used these slides for a box of draws (7) for my wifes art storage. They work great and I have been a repeat buyer of the product. No issues and easy to install.
2,No Voice Dial!,"The sound quality of the headset is great, as is the clarity of the microphone. But even with the ""turbo button"" on, using this product with my Sanyo 8100 does not work with voice dial. The button triggers the ""who do you want to call"" portion, but either stating or yelling the name is useless as the phone will not recognize it. Pop this headset out, and the name will be recognized no problem."
3,Cnergy Ventures,"The cable arrived from Florida on-time and in good shape. You can't beat the price for what you get. Overall an excellent value.DB9 Female / DB25 Female, 9C, Molded, 6 ft (UL)"
4,Solid Slide,"The drawer slide seems to be solid and well constructed. Slides a littler harder than I would have expected, but still smooth. A good lower priced choice!"
4,Does a nice job.,I used them on an oak file cabinet and an entertainment center that I've built.They are tough to install but do a great job...
3,"Good, but not great","I purchased four sets for a small cabinet I am building. I have installed extension drawer slides before, which had one moving extension; these have three.No instructions came with the slides and the rear most screw holes were barely accessible by sliding the middle extension piece. Two of the drawers work fine, two continue to stick even after a lot of adjusting.After all the work, I wish now I had just gone with plain jane drawer guides without the extensions."
3,Disappointing but readable,"I was very pleased to have found a John Garfield bio. He is one of my favorite actors who,sadly, is underrated or even forgotten by most. I'm sorry to say then that ""He Ran All the Way"" is a disappointing,uneven,and incomplete portrait of such an interesting life. Nott's book is not especially well written. The reader never gets a true sense of Garfield, his relationship with his wife and children, or his colleagues. The book is full of generalities about Garfield's personality especially his womanizing and intellegence. The author also makes grand judgements about Garfield's movies that fans may not agree with. I did find it helpful as a resource for general facts about Garfield, especially his blacklisting. I hope to find another Garfield bio that's better written and more fleshed out. I'd love to see Patricia Bosworth write one. (She's written interesting bios about Brando and Clift.)"
3,"He Ran ""Midway""","This book has potential and I would recommend purchasing it, but it is verbose and ""text booky"", something I don't want in a Hollywood autobiography."
4,solid 4 stars,"as the book jacket says, contains the best asteroid story ever. true. the other story is very good too. both stories are smart and visionary. too bad it's out of print."
3,Two stories in one volume,"It's been years since the last time I read this and I found that I still enjoyed it. Being a combination of three shorter pieces of fiction set in a common universe with overlapping characters, it just doesn't have the same kind of satisfaction one gets with a full length novel."
5,Just what I needed!,"I couldn't even find something similar in the boat gear stores! This is just what I needed to keep my fruit and vegies in. When you live in a tight space, this is a great space-saving item."
3,Came Unraveled,"The fruit did great in the basket and I really loved it until one day I put new fruit in it and it broke and came unraveled and my fruit went flying. Lasted less then a year.Once I contacted the people I bought it from they did however replace the mesh part at no cost to me.So just a few months later since i wrote the above and got my mesh replacement, it unraveled again! I tried my best to hot glue it back together, functions again but doesn't look the same anymore."
4,Good book,"I thought this was based on the Hallmark movie, Loving Leah, but it wasn't. My fault for not reading the description. Was pleasantly surprised that it was a good book. If you want a ""typical"" romantic novel, go for it. Easy read."
4,"wow,wow!","Well,I've just got the first volume this month,it was available since last year but I just got it!Wow,Wow!I'm guy but I really like it!I surely want to other guys(and girls)to get this series,it really a good one!!!It all worth it!Yucie and glenda are realy funny!eventhough,they always fight but you can see,they're not really fighting seriously,I think in the end they'll be the best of Friends!!!"
4,A little of everything.,"Puchi-Puri Yuushi; The story bounces back & forth between comedy & drama, with the kind of laughing that wakes your neighbors up & the kind of lovey-dovey friendship you can only dream of. However, I'm not into these shoujouai-suggestive series & the ending changes the genre into a tragedy."
5,Great product,"I drink about one of these every 2 weeks, for first time ever I had a outbreak of gout in my right foot to the point of couldn't walk, I am a person who doesn't care to take medication that doctors hand out and with family that has gout and are taking those pills that don't work, I did some research and found that watching diet and adding the apple cider vinegar to my water in the morning and night and drinking water thru the day, that within a week the gout was gone, I can move again and I never spent a penny at the doctors.I received this quickly and in perfect condition I recommend this and seller 100% to everyone."
3,Tastes ok but not great,I order this because of the raving about the taste. Personally I like the Braggs brand better. It's the gold standard of ACV for 100 years.
3,Maddening design flaw,"All that the positive reviews said is correct, in my experience. The device is reasonably priced and records and plays back reasonably well.However, mine has an absolutely maddening flaw: the batteries are held in by a small 'door' that hinges from the bottom of the device. The battery door opens at the slightest touch: in fact, if often opens (and the batteries therefore fall out) while in my pocket, without particularly being touched at all. You don't lose your recordings, but you have to re-set all your time and date settings as a result. For me this one flaw almost negates the good features because it makes the device so frustrating to use.Also, don't assume that the memory cards included or available for this device can be used in a PC-attached card reader: they cannot, since they have a unique proprietary format. So you cannot put these cards into a card reader and import the sound files into your PC."
4,GOOD ENOUGH,JOCKEY HAS BEEN AROUND (SEEMS FOREVER) AND THEY MAKE A VERY GOOD PRODUCT. I AM HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND RECOMMEND IT TO ANONE IN THE MARKET FOR A GOOD VALUE.
4,Recommended Read,"Very easy reading style, engaging, yet well organized and detailed. The author is clearly passionate about this subject and has researched extensively. An important resource for any person studying Biblical prophesy."
2,"it's ok, BUT....","We decided to get the iQuest master edition because it had this rewriteable cartridge and CDs with all the material - seemed like a no-brainer to spend [$$$] for everything rather than [$$$] for the iQuest and [$$$] each for the cartridges. Unfortunately, those prewritten cartridges hold entire books, this re-writeable one only holds a few chapters - or about 15 to 30min of material. Unfortunately, we whought it would be good for planetrips, long car trips, etc, But now we're looking at [$$$] to get a books worth of material to be able to do this. I feel tremendously mislead buy the manufacturer..."
3,Black & Decker HJ28 Handy Juicer,I ordered 2 HJ28 citrus Handy Juicers and I received one of it and another of a different number and I have not tried it out yet and don't know how I will like it. I was told that you had two in the number I ordered. do you just give another product without notification?
2,CHEAP fragile plastic parts,I had the same experience as the first reviewer. After 2 out of the four plastic tooth needed for clockwise rotation broke the juicer did not work anymoreBetter spend your money in another product
2,Parts missing,"The drawer slides themselves are very sturdy and will do the job well. The problem is that all 5 of the packages were opened prior to shipping and all the screws were taken out. In fact, only 3 of the original plastic packages were still with the slides, the other two pair were loose in the box. There was one small plastic bag in one of the pairs from which the screws for that pair had been removed. It contained one screw that had avoided being robbed out of the package. I now have to go out and find the correct size screw before they can be installed. I have used this style slide in the past and they always come with screws for installation."
1,poor quality,"I have installed a variety of drawer slides over the years... Blum, Grant, Accuride. These Shop Fox slides are my least favorite. The are very stiff... even with complete re-lubrication they barely move if you are not pushing or pulling. You can see the inner glide section twisting as you extend them (even with empty drawers). They have plastic extension limiters which I suspect will not last the life of the cabinet they are installed in. The mechanism that holds the drawer closed is friction based and requires extra pressure to completely close the drawer. As mentioned in other reviews, they do not ship with the required about of screws to install them... this is a blessing as the included pan head screws are so poorly made that they don't fit well in any size phillips screwdriver and this combined with the softness of the metal almost insures that the head will strip (these were installed in baltic birch ply). I would not recommend this brand."
3,"works great, but doesn't last very long!","Works great, nice wide ribs to prevent slipping, but only lasted close to a year, before it started slipping, and no matter how much I tightened the belt it would continue to slip."
3,some great stuff - lots of filler,"This is an overblown, filler-packed version of a what would have been a real good LP-length album.But yes, the good stuff is real nice.I am a big fan of these:- Godstar (pick a version - Ready Steady Go is the best I think)- As Tears Go By- Je T'Aime, Moi Non Plus- Just Like Arcadia- Roman P- Good VibrationsI just think that unless you are a PTV fanatic (perhaps like some of the other reviewers?) it would be hard to recommend paying top dollar for this 2CD set. And it is a bit annoying to listen to the album straight through - as you'll hear 6 versions of the best track (Godstar)."
3,An Orphan and a Mystery,"I enjoyed reading Ghosts in the Gallery. Jenny is an endearing character who wins your heart. Who wouldn't love a poor orphan child left to the mercy of relatives she has never met? The mystery is well written and keeps the reader guessing about what will happen next. At times it was difficult to keep all of the characters straight, but all comes together in the end. Barbara Brooks Moore writes in such detail that the reader feels as if she were at Graymark Manor itself."
5,Outstanding,"Construction and functionality of these glides is top notch. Smooth, solid, yet with no play. I have no doubt they will exceed their duty rating. If I need more I'll look no further than these. A+"
4,poor package but good service,"They packed the slides with standard carton. As a result, the box was puctured and one pair lost. But they express mailed the missing pair."
4,Eye Opening,"Everyone comes to a point in their life when they ask themselves, is this the life I want to be leading? Even though my career isn't within the corporate world this book helped me identify and address certain aspects and issues that can be improved upon, changed or eliminated from my life. If you have reached this cross-road in your life this book is a must read!"
5,Read it... then read it AGAIN!,"Reading this book is almost like having Simon in the room with you, cheering you along. His personality and energy jumps off the pages. His encouragement is sincere and his passion is infectious. I have seen him speak, and was amazed that so much enthusiasm can come from one person!! If you have not seen him speak... DO! If you can book him to speak for your organization... DO IT! If you have not read this book yet... READ IT!I recommend reading the book once, but skip the journal exercises. Then go back and spend a whole day going through the book again and doing the exercises. If you can devote one day to working through them, and truly focus on your passion, I think you will find this book to be an invaluable guide to finding what you are looking for in your life. As Simon says, ""DREAM BIG!"" Who better to learn from than someone who just did it!?"
5,Well made,"This product has been most satisfactory -- sturdy and well made. There is a considerable amount of assembly, but don't let the instruction manual frighten you! All of the parts have been carefully placed where you'll need them, and lots of pre-assembly set-up took place before packaging."
5,wonderful,"Many have stated it all here so I will not bore you with the same ol same ol. But the great reviews are all spot on. I LOVE this inversion table...I do it every single day for 5 months now and it releives stress, and an inversion a day keeps the Chiropractor away. I have stopped going...this was a large part of that. I love it...recommended!"
4,invalid comparisons with eMac,"I'm amazed at people claiming the eMac offers more for the money. It is cheaper but it doesn't have an LCD screen, and it has slower memory, a different generation of processor and much slower buses.I have yet to test one myself, but the only obvious criticism is that it should have FireWire 800, if Apple wants rapid adoption of this technology before a faster version of USB appears.Others have criticisms such as the relatively low spec graphics, but for a home machine, unless you want to be at the leading edge for gaming, it's a pretty good package. I tried to price something equivalent at Dell's web store and it came out more expensive, without even adding in software to match that Apple supplies.For those who think it won't be a hit: check out Amazon's computer top sellers list (go to desktops) and see where it's placed. You may be surprised."
3,Good machine but screen quality is poor!,"This is an amazing machine. BUT the 17"" machine has got to have the worst quality lcd going. The viewing angles are bad and the color is grainy. I have the 20"" and would highly reccomend that model instead of this one. For just a few more hundred dollars you can have the superior quality of the 20"" screen and a viewing angle that doesnt change color and get blurry at an angle."
2,"Switched to Apple, now I want to switch back","I like how it looks, I liked OSX for the most part, but this computer isn't that great. The processor isn't that strong. My Athlon 2100 could process faster than this thing could and it was a fraction of the price.Here is my main concern though. I've had this iMac for about 3 months now and its been pretty good up until now. The screen randomly flickers now and every once in a while it hangs for about 5 seconds (nothing works, can't move mouse, sounds stops playing). The computer even freezes to the point where I have to shut it down and restart. I also turned it off thinking it overheated. Let it cool down for a few hours and started it up and it took about 8 restarts to actually let it boot up into OSX.I wouldn't recommend buying this product. I don't know how other macs are but thisi one, my first one, is not good at all. I plan to try and make apple take it back or sell it for as much as I can get. I want my PC back."
4,A good recicling book,"The author share his own daily practice pitfals, difficulties and the solutions found for them. It is an interesting review, even for new surgeons who are starting their surgical practice. It reports some complications and the way the author solve them. The new surgeons can get some idea of how they may deal with possible problems before facing them. Anyway, no book substitute any cadaveric dissection, and it is also a very good opportunity for testing the procedures described along the chapters."
4,Good,"I must say that R.L. Stine made the mistake of making the Senior year book. It ruins all of the books. It makes the books way too predictable. For example in the year book it says that Clarissa hates Mira, so obviousely she was the killer in this book. I think he should have made the year book at the end of the series. Making it at the starting ruined the whole thing."
1,family circle,It was a subscripition for 1 year . I got my first issue for Feb. did not get a jan issue and it says on the outside expires dec. 2013. The magazine is so thin mostly advertizements.
3,creative magazine,This is a typical magazine with not a ton of real stories and a lot of ad's. I do like the craft suggestions and pages about the holidays. The suggestions they have for crafts are creative and fun.
4,Wrong address,Please send to the right address and I would be happy. This is a gift for my daughter and she would like to receive it at her house.
3,Problem resolved??,"I had to contact the publisher because they started a new subscription for me instead of extending my current subscription. So far, have received duplicate issues of what I received from my current subscription. I provided them with the information they requested and have not heard back if issue is resolved. Guess I will find out if I get 2 September issues and the expiration dates are different."
3,Not Enough Content,I would not renew my subscription to Family Circle. there are too many ads and not enough articles to interest me.
5,love this mag,i love this magazine! it has tons of new recipes and decorating ideas to keep my interested and busy all thruout the month
3,Too many ads,"There are way too many ads, but I do like some of the articles and recipes. More coupons would be nice."
2,Family Circle,It's changed! It's all advertisement. It's horrible. Found nothing worthwhile in my Dec. issue. It and the coupons inside were already outdated.
5,A Great Read,"I have always loved Family Circle because it's chock full of great articles with lots of information, recipes and the latest products. Amazon makes it so afforable to have these subscriptions delivered to your door!!!"
5,Family Circle Magazine,"Over the years I have received a number of magazines. I can safely say that this is the only one I read cover to cover. I was a little bit weary of getting a magazine subscription through Amazon, however I have nothing but positive to say about the process. I received the first magazine even prior to stated shipping date, and have not had any issues so far."
5,FAMILY CIRCLE MAGAZINE,I have enjoyed reading this magazine for many years because of the diversity of its contents. I was so happy to see that AMAZON had such a good deal to buy FAMILY CIRCLE magazine that I immediately bought it and now am happy to have a 2 year subscription to a favorite magazine.THANKS AMAZON!
2,Very Disappointed,"This magazine has great recipes, however, that is all it has besides ads. I don't mind ads but every page is too much!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,1960's Revisited,This magazine has too many adds and is run of the mill. It seems as if the layout hasn't changed since the 1960's.
5,DAPHNE DOLL,"MY DAUGHTER IS 3 AND JUST LOVES THIS DAPHNE DOLL!!!! SHE GOES EVERYWHERE TO THE SHOWER, TO PARK AND THEN OFF TO BEACH!!!! MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS TOY SO MUCH!!!! SHE SAID SHE WANTS TO BE LIKE HER WHEN SHE GROWS UP!!! THANKS FOR MAKING SUCH A GREAT TOY! NATALIE & DAUGHTER AUTUMN"
4,Where's the rest of the gang?,"We really like our Daphne doll. She's been solving mysteries all over our house! My daughter has enjoyed playing with her a lot, but we sure would love to have the rest of the gang to go with her!"
4,This toy is the best!,"This is a toy that everyone who likes Daphne(girls, anyway)might like. She comes with great stuff, and you can take off her jacket if you don't like the way it looks on her. She comes with a plush Scooby-Doo, too. It makes a great present!"
4,Heavy hit of High School Nostalgia,"This is one of those CDs that gets a good playing at my place. It has all the tracks that made this UK pop outfit huge through out the 1980's.Formed in 1981, The original line up of Wham included George Michael, Andrew Ridgeley and backing vocals from Pepsi and Shirley.Their first Australian hit was ""the Wham Rap"" which debuted in Christmas 1982. Their awesome chain of hits continued with Young guns, Bad boys, Wake me up, Careless Whisper, Freedom, Everything she wants, I'm your man, Where did your heart go and the edge of heaven.Yepppp!!! I'm a die hard WHAM! fan. There has been some other wham compilations released since this one, None of them come close to the great selection of tracks on this one.Only small picking bone with this album is the drawn out version of ""last christmas"". Would of preferred the original radio mix, hense the four star rating."
4,Somebody Tell Me....,"I grew up with Wham. I was a teenager and thought they were the greatest things since sliced bread.I own all of the albums on vinyl...LOLSeriously, my musical tastes are a bit more sophisticated now but I love listening to these songs and singing at the top of my lungs. Careless Whisper was the best dramatic 80's ballad ever.My other favorite is the extended version of Everything She Wants. ( I would love for Maxwell to remake this song. His voice would really do it justice).While George went on to make Faith....another great album....you can immerse yourself in this compilation and relive the 80's when Neon and Tshirts with BIG BLACK WRITING were in!"
5,"A Deffinate ""Must Have"" for the 80s Music Fan","George Michael & Andrew Ridgely define 80s Pop Music. WHAM! burst onto the scene with their HUGE ""Make It Big"" album that launched the mega-hit ""Careless Whisper"" and more. Followed by ""Music From The Edge Of Heaven"" with ""I'm Your Man"". But this CD here ""FINAL"" is the best of all. Its a Greatest Hits type of CD and I am so happy to finally have it. I have never seen it or heard of it in the USA, I have only seen the UK and Japan Releases. (I own the Japan). But well worth it. Dont got it, Go get It!"
5,the final: best of the best gold,thank god for imports - great cd! really brings together all the great wham! songs from the '80s. i highly recommend this to all!
5,Perfect Gift,This was the perfect gift for my husband who has been looking for a Wham cd. The cd came in great condition and fast delivery.
2,A Disappointment,"I have to disagree with the three individuals who've posted reviews so far. I loved Ella Enchanted; I was very disappointed with this book. It seems to be written for a much younger audience, despite its length. While Levine has some cute ideas about how Never Land functions, I found the fairies' personalities to be so one-dimensional as to be almost non-existent and the art to be a hideous pastiche of icky-poo sweet ersatz Disney. The book might work well as a read-aloud for three or four year-olds with a good attention span; I would hesitate to give it to anyone older. Please, Ms. Levine, go back to letting your wit and intelligence and humor show!"
3,Our copy fell apart!,"My daughter enjoyed this, I think... The book is pretty. The pages have a good feel to them and there are nice illustrations throughout. But, the glue that holds the edges of the paper to the inside of the spine failed. My daughter kept reading it, leaving pages here, there and everywhere. There are so many scattered pages that I don't think we'll ever get it all back together. It would be a tedious job to collate them anyway. So, into the trash... I'm ranking this as a 3 because it's not the author's fault the mechanics of the book failed."
5,Perfect for Peter Pan fans,"My daughter is six, and she loves this book. She is a big fan of J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. Gail Carson Levine has written a book about Neverland that is in the spirit of Barrie's Peter Pan. She even dedicates the book to Barrie. I especially like the idea of talents among the fairies. Every fairy has a talent, and every talent is valued and necessary for the well-being of the Home Tree and Fairy Haven. Here is my daughter's review of the book:I think the book is really great! I really like Prilla! She is funny and silly! She is really good at blinking to the mainland. Prilla is sad when she thinks that she doesn't have a talent, but at the end it turns out that she does have a talent, and that talent saves Mother Dove.I know you are going to like this book! Grace"
3,Depressing story for a young child,"I loved the beautiful watercolor illustrations for this book. Unfortunately I would not recommend the story for a child under 7 or 8. This was definitely too depressing for my 5 year old. The Quest is adventurous and a bit scary which my child dealt with well but the Mother Dove character is on the verge of death most of the book. Her injuries are described in graphic detail and could be upsetting to a child expecting a light, fun fairy story. SPOILER ALERT: The ending was disappointing to me. After 100 pages of the brave fairies weathering hardships the idea that children clapping for Never Land fixing everything felt incongruous with the book's tone - it becomes a story meant for an older child with an ending meant for a toddler."
5,Pure magic for the young and young at heart,"As soon as I found out Disney was doing a Tinkerbell\fairy line and there was a book It was my quest to buy it.I am an avid reader and mother to a 3 YO and 5 YO.I loved it!!It is an incredibley easy read! AND It is full of magic and wonder to me!!! I cant wait to share this magic with my son and daughter as we sit together and read.I enjoyed getting to know Tink on the fairy level and not just Peter Pans sidekick! I love the names, the artwork, and the story Levine wove.. While it would have been MARVELOUS if it had been expanded for an older audience That is not for whom it was written and I have no doubts my youngsters will love every last word of this tale and not get lost along the way.I hope there will be many more stories about Tink and her fairy friends!!!"
5,This book was great!,This is a great adventure about Prilla and the other fairies. If you evern wanted to know what its like to be a fairy this is the book to read. Tinkerbell is much different than what she is in the Peter Pan movie so it makes it interesting.
2,Not an Instructional/Practice Video,"First of all, the production value is extremely low, but I expected that. The real problem is that this is not an instructional video/yoga practice video at all. In fact, I'm not sure what the purpose of this is. It's just a low quality video of two women doing yoga, with a narrator that keeps repeating that what they're doing is dangerous and that you shouldn't try it without propper instruction. However, the moves in the main portion of the video really aren't that advanced. Since I had taken a yoga class before, I could just about follow along anyway except for two things: 1) I kept having to look up to see what they were doing, and 2) instead of relaxing, I kept thinking ""will that narrator just shut up already?"" Actually, that's the cleaned up version of what I was thinking...glad I rented it instead of buying."
5,TOP's best in 20 years,"This CD is not just great, it's incredible. The horns are tight as ever but the real shining star of this CD is the stunning performances by the rhythm section. David Garibaldi and Rocco P. are still the funkiest dudes on the planet - guitarist Jeff Tamalier is awesome and Roger Smith might be the finest B3 player in jazz/funk.Buy this CD."
5,Best In Years!,"This is the best Tower of Power CD I've heard in years. Hell, this is the best CD I've heard in years. I've been a huge fan of Tower of Power since buying ""Bump City"" back when I was in grade school (1972), I own 18 Tower of Power CD's, and I would put this in the top 3. New lead singer Larry Braggs is a monster! Drummer David Garibaldi is back! Emilio Castillo and the Funky Dr. (and others) have written some smokin' tunes! The horns are tight (Lenny Pickett does some horn arrangements)! Francis Rocco Prestia is healthy and still the baddest bass player on earth! If you like jazzy, funky SOUL music, BUY THIS CD!"
4,Zoned Out,"Yes! The Real Deal. Tower finally made it Back to Oakland this time...best in over a decade, probably since the T.O.P. release in 93' with Lenny's sax solos. Reasons: The best horn arrangements since Greg's departure, and the driving rhythm section and Hammond B-3 combination really made this one work. Plus they dropped those weak love ballad's. Back on the gritty streets is where they belong."
5,Some things get better with age........,"Like a fine wine, this band gets better with age. I had a chance to listen to some of the tracks before they went on the CD. This is the best cd to date, with Urban Renewal being a close second. Rocco and Garibaldi are the toughest tag team duo of drmmers/bassists, bar none!! Couple that with an outstanding rythym section, tight horns, and the outstanding vocal styling of Larry Braggs, T.O.P. IS DEFINATELT TOPS!!"
5,The North Pole Moves to NY as Unexpected Disaster Strikes,"Two young people in love, Mark and Karen, battle to survive in a world that has become hell frozen over...New York buried under the New Ice Age...The Big Freeze swirling wild, dangerous winds across the Artic oceans...acros the Humbolt Glacier...In a flash it grows, creeps outward, gathers force, becomes gigantic, imperils the world. How long can people survive? Is this the way the world ends...buried in Ice?"
4,Day After Tomorrow Similiarities,"I also thought of this book after watching the movie. The similarities are somewhat striking. Both are based around the effects of a sudden Ice Age on New York City. Also, both focus on the rebel climatologists that first deduce what is happening. Further, they both use the father-son relationship of the rebel climatologists as the key theme of the story. Finally, they both have a separate climatologist that is based a continent away from the action who is the one that really figures out what is going on. All in all, it seems a bit coincidental not to have some connection."
5,Fine,"I used this to fix a broken slide on my bedroom dresser. The slides came with screws and were easy to put on. They don't come with instructions if you need that, although I'm sure there's plenty of info online. I would buy again."
3,Feet are too big and size is not quite as advertized,"The fleece is very warm but the feet are way to big and the size chart is not quite accurate. I went by the chart but it is about two inches too short so it is not as comfortable as it could be. I would recommend not going to the limit of what is recommended, go to the next bigger size."
2,big feet pajamas,"I bought this as a fun gift for my husband who is about 6'1"" in height and has an average body frame. I bought an extra large so that it would not be too tight in the seat. It is fine for his height but it was made for a huge round man! My advice would be not to buy these pajamas. They are on the pricey side for something that will not be worn often and the sizing is just way off."
4,bought for christmas,This was purchased as a christmas present so I don't have much to say about it yet. I do hope that my wife will enjoy it though.
2,Not really pleased with this product.,"I bought this for my younger cousin who always joked about getting a pair. He loved them but within 1 hour of wearing them, the velcro that holds the drop seat up, tore for no reason at all. Other than that, my cousin said they were comfortable and has since worn them a few times with no problem. Our grandmother stitched up the tear and reinforced the entire velcro strip. Since then they have not torn."
2,feet too small,"could not wear all night because the feet were too small and cramped my foot. so no, i would not recommend"
5,Great Book,Jean Ferris did a great job on this book. It was funny and hard to put down.If you like this book you'll love her other book Once Upon a Marigold.
1,Simply crap,This product will ruin your life.Backed up all my data and then it just died a month later.No recovery. Not even the Geek Squad could bring it back to life.
5,One of my favorites,"Four long, atmospheric jazz pieces. Weber plays a fretless electric bass with that interesting ""owOWWoo"" timbre, typically with electric piano, soprano sax (another interesting timbre, like the oboe) and drum kit. Composed stuff with sections, counterpoint, transitions...like a lot of good ECM jazz.""Sand Glass"" has a bass ostenato played with the lowest string and what must be very high on the top string, washed over and counterpointed against by the electric piano, moaned at with a low sliding synth, and then sung over by the sax...and at one point some crumhorn-like instrument--maybe a mute on the sax?""Left Turn"" has a drifty acoustic piano solo that leads into a section in groups of five measures of 9/8. The beat is driving, almost frantic and yet soprano sax chords arch over the long measures making it almost stately.Sonically, rhythmically, melodically engaging and hypnotizing. Unhurried trips to large beautiful out-of-the-way places where interesting things are happening."
2,the wrong movi?????????,for me it was what was I thinking this I GAVE to my step dad even he did not care for it #%T&^
5,rubbermaid shelves,Tese shelvs are great! They were very easy to put together and are as sturdy as they say. I am definstly going to buy more soon.
4,Tackling clutter #2,"I'm acutally using this as a printer stand as well as storage for paper and supplies in my home office. Easy to put together, but remember to use pressure on the plastic posts to make sure it's steady. The only drawback is that the whole thing shakes when my injet printer is doing it's thing, but hey, the colors match ... win some, lose some."
4,"Good Quality, Easy to Assemble",I have been very pleased with the Rubbermaid Shelving system. It was extremely easy to assemble. I use it for plants out on my porch. It's also very stable; we've had several severe thunderstorms with high winds and it has not budged one bit.
4,THE BEST 42nd STREET COLLECTION YET!,"For those familiar with Grindhouse movies and/or the 42nd Street Forever series this is a ""must have""! With almost 4 hrs of the trashiest, funniest and downright coolest movie trailers you may ever see, this is an excellent collection for any fan of exploitation cinema. And you get to witness all of this debauchery in beautiful blu-ray - pretty sure this is the best these movies have ever looked/sounded. The only reason I didn't give this disc 5 stars is because it is essentially a collection of the first two 42nd Street Forever DVDs (which I already owned), although a few new trailers like ""Honky"", ""Dr. Butcher, MD"" (LOVE this one!) and John Carpenter's ""Dark Star"" are great additions. I highly recommend checking out this compilation!"
1,Gimme a break,"""Exploitation fans"" that care about 1080p and Hi-Def bells and whistles!?! Gimme a break. Synapse are the worst offenders. I'm a fan of this stuff because it looks filthy, not because it's beautiful and pristine... *shakes head and sighs*"
2,Bender metric not imperial,"Bought this product with the expectation that it would bend 1/2 and 3/4 inch copper. When I purchased this product there wasn't any explanation as to it's capabilities so I made an assumption that it would meet my expectations. Unfortunately this bender is made to bend metric size copper pipe which isn't much use in the US where standard sizes are imperial. As I was purchasing it from a US company it never occurred to me that it would be metric. I suggest that ""Grizzly"" add a better description to this product in future."
1,It's Yosh's Fault!!!!,This would be the best album ever but Yosh ruined it. He's this MC outta D-Town and he just ruined the tracks. Everything he touched turned to nothing...All I'm saying that I think everyone should wear shirts saying how much we hate his raps and his voice. Then maybe he wont be featured on the next rap. Word.
4,Hilarious,I have to say this is one of the funnier series I have watched recently. All five volumes include the original Japanese language track with English subtitles and is dubbed in English as well the only thing about it I don't like is in the English language track it has more potty mouth language and the original language track has a more serious view of the issues going on which makes more sence when it is watched than the English version.NO matter what though both language versions are funny to watch.
3,Not A Bad Replacement,"Just installed a TR2 M2 on my Athlon XP 2400+. It works well on high speed setting, and so far CPU temp is slightly better than with stock AMD fan. But that's it, no extreme cooling.The fan controls take up a PCI slot, and don't fit so well. The screw groove in the top is misplaced, leaving a gap between the plate and the chassis and clashing against neighboring slot brackets.The fact that you can adjust the fan speed manually is a bit silly... I immediately found that the low setting was too low, as the system automatically shut off after about a minute. The medium setting is relatively quiet, but not cool enough. Finally, the high fan setting keeps the CPU at around 50C, under load, which is only slightly better than the stock fan, but still an improvement."
4,Not as recent as some might have us believe...,"This is a delightful book that makes a delicious change from the normal books on bisexuality. Full of great stories and a wonderous insight from start to finish, it kept me enthralled until the last page and then made me wish for more. It's rather refreshing to see something that deals with a history of bisexuality, rather than a personal insight. This made it even more of a gem, but in itself it is a must for every bi bookcase."
3,Not quotes from Freethinkers,"These are quotes about Freedom and Liberty. It is not a book of quotes from Freethinkers (people who have rejected religious dogma). The author doesn't seem to know what the term ""Freethinkers"" means. I'm guessing he thought that Freethinkers are people who think about freedom."
4,"Eclectic, Evocative, Engaging: Freedom by Leonard Frank","I am almost always on the hunt for inspiring, evocative quotes which will either be ""seeds"" for my writing or will provide support for my message. This quote resource book is a top notch find for those of us who quest continually after freedom in its many forms.I appreciate Frank's intention for creating this offering, which in his words is ""To bring together the best ideas from the most diverse group of people as possible."" He definitely succeeds as he delivers mightily on this intention.Topics within the overall framework of ""Freedom"" include ""Liberty or Death"", ""The Mind"". ""Privacy"" and ""The Press"". He also dives into personal and spiritual ares with segments on topics such as ""Self Realization.""For those of us who dine on lots of food for thought, this will hearty meal."
5,Great orientation to school!,"My 21-month old can't get enough of the rhythmic rhyme, detailed illustrations and fun adventure of a bunny's day at school! She will actually sit the entire 5-7 minutes it takes to read the story - amazing. She relates to quite a bit of it, as well, since she spends one morning a week at a ""preschool"" parents morning out. This book is a great way to show your preschooler that school is fun!"
2,Don't believe all the hype!,"I was given this set as a birthday gift and my initial thoughts were that this was a great gift. I found out that this set was purchased after reading all the spectacular reviews on Amazon. After using the tools on my grill, I was not impressed with their quality. When I tried to use the tongs to pick up a small sausage, the metal bent at the point where they are reinforced for gripping. I ended up using some oxo tongs which do not bend and are much more comfortable. The knife included in the set is bulky and not well designed. When I used the knife and fork to cut up a rotisserie chicken, the knife was very awkward to use and not very sharp to boot. I do like the basting brush and the fork is pretty good at stabbing meat. While I haven't used the spatula yet, it looks satisfatory to flip burgers. Overall, the case and tools look nice but I wouldn't judge a book by its cover either, and I would be more impressed if the tools were of a higher quality."
5,beautiful and sturdy,"I bought this as a housewarming gift and love it so much I will probably get it for my husband. I imagine it is not that practical to put the tools back into the case all the time but the tools are so nice, it will be fine to keep in my kitchen. These pieces are much larger than I expected. The handles are long and thick, the utensil ends are also very large which should be handy at the BBQ (since it is a gift, I haven't personally used it). Look closely at the spatula, it has many different uses, the handle is a bottle opener, the side of the spatula is a knife. The case makes a wonderful presentation for a gift and could be handy if you camp or have some other reason to transport it."
