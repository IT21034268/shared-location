3,"Worth Watching, but lingered in parts.","Cinematography was good, casting good, but this flick lacked something. I was reminded while watching this movie of the role religion and politics has played in corruption and loss of life to the people throughout history. Probably there is more to do with religion than politics, but then, can the two be separated? I was ambivalant whether to give this movie a 3 or 4 star rating. I gave it a three because there were several parts where the story became bogged down, and downright boring. A mediocre movie, but some good historical significance. Especially adept at portraying the thinking-error rationalization of religous ""cleansing"". Wow, history just keeps repeating itself. Amazing. Not a movie for the collection, rent it. See Dangerous Liaisons, now that is a good movie."
5,Blanchett is the BEST,"Even Bette Davis, the 1939 ""Elizabeth"",would praise Kate Blanchett's portrayal. I thought, until now, that Glenda Jackson (1971 BBC TV Series)WAS Elizabeth II and pictured her in my mind when thinking of the ""Virgin Queen."" Blanchett is now in my mind's eye as the beautiful young Elizabeth... with the voice to match! The musical score and supporting cast make this film one of the very special historical movies to have."
4,Good movie but not Historical,"I am an Elizabethian history buff. I have books and movies about her. I felt this movie was good but most things not true. Robert Dudley never betrayed her, yes he married in secret to one of her ladies in waiting, after his First wife died. Elizabeth did know he was married. They also never consumated their love she was a virgin. They also portrayed her as a weak woman at the beginning ""she was never a weak woman!!"" She was the greatest Queen England has ever seen or will see. It is another way Hollywood changes history to fit it's format. I have seen three people as the Queen,Kate Blanche, Judi Dench,And Glenda Jackson. They are all good but Glenda portrays Queen excellently."
5,"Love, lust, and passion: the key factors.","Elizabeth is a gripping drama that gives to its audience not only the life story of the first queen of England, Elizabeth, but also the traumatic decisions and choices that she made in order to keep her country together. Chock-full of haunting melodies by a great composer, filled with themes of love, hate, and treason, this one will definitely please anyone who has a passion for historical dramas. The DVD version is a hit: audio commentary about each scene gives a wonderful explanation of many underlying themes, the Dolby tracks are stupendous, and the images are clear, crisp and fresh. Cate Blanchett delivers a powerful performance, as does Joseph Fiennes and, as always, Geoffrey Rush. Rent it, buy it, whatever you do--- enjoy!"
4,Cate Blanchett Tour De Force!!!,"This is a semi-fictionalized account of the reign of Elizabeth 1, and the story itself is interesting, but Cate Blancett absolutely steals the show! How she didn't win the academy award for this, I can't fathom. Her performance alone ranks as one of the best you will ever see.While the story plays fast and loose with some historical bits, it's still an interesting look into the 'rebirth' of England and the influence of the Catholic church on it's rulers.Geoffery Rush is also excellent as her faithful advisor and 'bodyguard.' He is sheer evil that you can't manage to disdain.Great movie, well worth the price!"
4,Excellent,"I rented this DVD and was so favorably impressed that I bought the movie for my permanent collection. The entire production is excellently executed. Wardrobe, sets, story all seem to be historically accurate presenting a visual ""fly on the wall"" perspective to an exciting part of world history. Cate Blanchette delivers a passionate and soulful performance of her character Elizabeth. The supporting actors were equally well-cast and delivered believable and engaging performances, enhancing the experience. Cinematography was excellent, given the difficulty of some of the scene's sets. I will watch this many times more. Thank you."
4,A pleasure,"Well done film which is a must-have in a personal library to accompany ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age."" Many hours of viewing pleasure.xrhae"
5,Amazing!,"Excellent cinematography combined with incredible acting, set design, costumes, and a spot on script will make this part of English history come alive!"
4,Intense,"While the historical data may or may not be accurate, it is nonetheless, made believable in this film. It is emotionlly intense and captivating. A wonderfully interesting story about a historical figure we seldom hear about in the media. Wonderful acting, directing, costumes, and screenplay. It works very well. Educational and Inspiring."
1,"Mario Puzo's ""Elizabeth""","Did anyone else draw the cinematic parallel between Elizabeth cloistered away in deep study while Walsingham and the troops were systematically killing the ""enemies"" -- and the last scene in ""The Godfather"" where Michael Corleone attends a baptism while scenes of revenge are intercut with swelling music? There were just so many ham-handed elements in Elizabeth that just provoked ridicule and popcorn tossing at the screen. PS Robert Dudley was actually Fredo and when Michael, er I mean Elizabeth, finds out his betrayal, well... see the movie..."
4,Exquisite,"This is a brief opinion of the film Elizabeth--you can read detailed synopsis elsewhere if you're interested. Cate Blanchett's performance, as well as the screenwriter's care with her complicated character, are a marvel to behold. The film itself is not perfect, but this film is well worth your time just for this exquisite performance by Ms. Blanchett. (By the way, try ""Oscar & Lucinda"" for another wonderful performance by Cate.)"
2,Overated,"Overated as far as story or historical context goes. The conspiracy never actually makes you wonder if it's going to work or not. Sets are medieval, costumes are gorgeous. Cate is great, but you will come away confused by the story and owning a number of misconcepts about what actually happened historically."
4,It was great,Elizabeth tech't me more about Queen Elizabeth 1. The story is great.If you like history about England you will love this
2,"Cate is superb, the movie isn't","Cate Balnchett give a bravo performance as Elizabeth I in this otherwise disappointing (and historically inaccurate) biopic.Nice cinematography, and some good turns by the supporting cast (most notably Geoffrey Rush) can't make up for the grizzly, almost sensationalistic nature of the script which seems more geared to attract American audiences then it does will telling a historical tale.Cate will survive this mess nicely. Look for her in the much better and criminally overlooked film ""Oscar and Lucinda."""
4,"Visually Stunning ""what-if"" version of Historic Royal","I was almost as much enamored by the stunning visual feel, cinematography and lighting-effects of this film, as the performance by Miss Blanchette. This film ranges in tone: from silly to grave timbres, certainly covering the catharsis of emotion, as well as creating believable characters (with a glaring exception or two: you be the judge) ...this film would round out the many colors in a collector's set of biographical royalty movies. I'm not sure I'd watch it five times a week, but I'd make sure it didn't gather too much dust in my collection."
4,Historically..umm...skiddish,"This movie is fabulous entertainment, but if anacronisms and historical idiosyncracies bug you terribly, I'd skip it. If you're looking for a documentary, go to PBS, if you want a delightful interpretation--look here."
1,great actors-poor script,"Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush were perfect casting for the historical personages they portrayed. Unfortunately, the script is such a total distortion of history that they were wasted.If you know any history, you know that Elizabeth was no political innocent at the beginning of her reign. She knew what she was doing and had the sense to listen to Cecil (here portrayed as an impotent fool). I watched this movie in disbelief of its manifold inaccuracies. Particularly distasteful was the character assassination of Mary of Guise."
1,Once again Producers pander to Prurience...,"The dazzling sparkle of Cate Blanchett cannot save this disaster of a film from embarking on a literal trashing of the Great Queen Elizabeth I. One can only summon, since everyone in the film seemed preocupied with tawdry sex including a sicko murder in the palace, that the writers and the director were just pandering to the appalling sexual appetite of American audiences. The rather lush photography is supremely wasted by another romp into the sexual gardens by a supposed cerebral writer. I really thought the British had more decency than to make this trash.FeleciaP.S. - Sir Richard Attenborough should renounce the worst career move he has ever made."
1,Off with its head!,"Other critical reviewers have already noted that Elizabeth makes a travesty of history, and unnecessarily so. The politics, personalties, and intrigues of the Elizabethan period were fascinating enough without debasing them with this kind of cinematic rubbish. Even more deplorable is the quality of the screenplay itself. In contrast to such classics as Elizabeth R and Mary Queen of Scots (and even The Virgin Queen), the writing here alternates between the banal and the sophomoric--it's just plain boring. See Shakespeare in Love for a lesson in how truly talented writers can bring this period alive with an engaging, witty, intelligent script."
3,Shame they had to tart up the material,"This a very mediocre offering given the forces that the filmmakers had at their disposal. I wished I were watching Elizabeth R (the old BBC series with Glenda Jackson) the whole time.They did not have the courage to think this material would carry the audience's interest by itself. I'm probably in the minority of people who are intensely interested in the Elizabethan era, but it's annoying to have them tart the thing up like this.They didn't need to put in the unlikely scenes with Elizabeth in bed with Robert Dudley, they didn't need to use modern orchestras for the music, and if they had gone with cheaper costumes and black-and-white film, I wouldn't have cared. As long as the story line is sensible and the acting is good.The acting is pretty good. Cate Blanchett is fine. I didn't like the script. As a fan of music from that period, I was annoyed to have them drag Elgar into it.Don't bother with this. Watch Elizabeth R instead."
4,NOT FOR THOSE WHO DEMAND HISTORICAL ACCURACY,"The intent of the director was to capture the ATMOSPHERE or ""flavor"" of the Elizabethan court. Intrigue, alliances, deceit, ambitions, trechery and emotions. In addition he means to show us that Elizabeth was a human being thrust into power, and all that power demands. An innocent among the wolves. On those points he got it right ALTHOUGH people were not quite as clean and good looking then. Times were brutal. A toothache could kill you. Lice were everywhere.Those who criticize on historical accuracy complaints miss the point. An historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more.The movie probably could have been a little longer as it is. Worthy of multiple viewings.Geoffrey Rush in a standout performance as Sir Francis Walsingham, Elizabeth's shadowy, street smart but patriotic ally who moves mountains for her with extreme ruthlessness from behind curtains. His performance alone makes this worth viewing."
1,Bah!,"This portrayal of Elizabeth was on a par with the second season of Blackadder, but not quite so good. On the other hand, Hollywood is not in the business of teaching history to the great unwashed, so historical atrocities like this and Braveheart are sure Oscar winners, provided they are sufficiently cheesy, sleazy, violent, loud, and artsy. Pecuniae vindice."
3,"Response to essex22@hotmail.com from Toronto, Canada","You're wrong, this is not the only film that explores princess Elizabeth's life before she becomes queen. Please view the colorful 1950's movie, ""Young Bess"", starring Jean Simmons as princess Elizabeth, Stewart Granger, Deborah Kerr and Charles Laughton reprising his famous role as Henry VIII. In addition, although it was made for television, the first episode of ""Elizabeth R"" starring Glenda Jackson also shows her precarious rise to power. This last version is the most historically accurate account of her youth and the best acted than either ""Elizabeth"" or ""Young Bess"" . Enjoy."
5,Superb in every way!!,"Loved everything: the acting, script, music, cinetography, and costumes. It was the true movie experience."
3,Disappointing,"The reviews called it brilliant; I found it tedious even as I found the quality of the acting excellent. Cate Blanchett certainly looked the part more than anyone else I've seen who portrayed Elizabeth; nevertheless, everything else seemed off. I particularly didn't like the staging and photography. It began to annoy me about midway through when I noticed that absolutely every scene had to be ""framed"". Either a balustrade, a curtain, a bannister, a door, or something was set in the foreground through which one viewed the scene. This became increasingly distracting until I almost lost the thread of the narrative. I am surely in the minority on this; however, as beautiful as the costumes and hairstyles were, as well acted as the parts were; nevertheless, the mediocrity of the direction, the diddling with history, and the affectations of photography ruined this film for me."
4,great cinema,"if you like historical dramas (like I do), especially of the English variety, then this is required viewing. I won't give plot details here, just go rent it, you'll love it. The sequel, ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" is even better."
2,Easily defeat-able!,"I bought this lock a few years ago as a security device when I moved to LA. This past week when I was driving to Nashville I put on the lock and lost the key at the motel. I had to remove the lock in order to continue driving. I ended up picking the lock in under 2 minutes with a couple of straightened out paper clips, and I don't know almost anything about picking locks. If you buy this lock do so knowing that this device is a VISUAL THEFT DETERRENT ONLY! This will not protect your car from being stolen if a thief knows anything about how to pick a lock!"
1,Doesn't work and won't honor warranty,"I bought a similar lock to this about 6 months ago, filled in the paperwork and sent it in by certified mail as requested to get their warranty in case my car was stolen. A few months later, my car got stolen, first time I've ever had a car stolen. First, this lock was able to be picked by a standard flat head screw driver. Except for it becoming loose, it would still be ""useable."" Second, when I went to file the warranty, they claimed the original registration never got to them and therefore not entered into their system. I attempted to show them that I had the receipt for the certified letter and a copy of my original receipt, but the representative basically told me they do not honor the 1000 deductable grantee. I was a faithful customer, but with this I'm going to be using other brands for my personal and business use. I expect they'll lose more than they gained by this decision over the course of 5-10 years."
2,P.O.S.,"This thing is the biggest P.O.S Steering wheel bar i have seen. Was not expecting much, but this thing is dinky. Feels like you could break it with you bear hands."
3,Decent lock for the money,"I purchased this lock a year and a half ago, and I would say it works best as a visual theft-deterrent. I haven't tried picking it, but it sounds like others have managed to pick it quite easily even without much experience.My main gripes about it are as follows:1) The keys bend very easily, so if you leave them in the lock when you place the lock on the floor of your vehicle when you're not using it, you may inadvertently bend the keys, which may lead to problem 2.2) At least with my lock, it is much more difficult to remove the key once it is in the locked position compared to when the key is in the unlocked position. I didn't have this problem initially, so it is likely exacerbated by the fact that the key is now bent a little. Regardless, it is very annoying fighting to put on the lock when you're in a rush. I've found that extending the lock arm a bit while wiggling the key usually helps when removing the key after locking the device."
1,No good junk.,I read a comment here about a guy who lost the key and opened this piece of junk in under 2 minutes.I took me 20 seconds!!!! I used a hair pin and a small flat screwdriver. This is the first time I open a lock!!!!
3,Not ideal for the new Elantra 2011,"This lock works, but the four hooks don't all fit onto the Elantra's steering wheel, so I can use only three.Also, the keys look and feel really flimsy."
4,hook steeting wheel lock,locks quick holds on to steering wheel very well.good price.I believe when a thief looks inside the car and sees the bright yellow steering wheel lock he will just pass it along and look for an easier vehicle to break into.
2,OK,"The locker I bought was not good cause the locker I bought was master lock but I got the other company, also I bought the new one and they gave me the used one. It has little rush on it, and the yellow thing was teared."
1,It doesn't work,I saw the older good reviews so I decided to get this lock but sadly it doesn't work whenever I try to adjust it according to the size of my steering. It's so frustating!
4,Works well and provides extra security with the 4 prongs.,"It works as described and makes me feel safer with four prongs instead of two. The silver bar that adjusts the length looks very small in diameter, so I don't know how easy it would be to cut. The bright yellow really stands out."
5,FANTASTIC RECORD!!!!!,"If you are considering buying this record, follow your intuition and get it!!! Mason Proffit is headed by the Talbot brothers, John and Terry. John eventually became a Catholic monk and Terry a Christian rocker. This CD was originally put out as two seperate vinal records, but it is nice to have both on one disc. Their sound is hard to really pin down, a little folk, a tiny bit of bluesy rock, and a sprinling of country. The vocals and harmonies always lift my spirit. This is also a relevant record because of it's mix of themes. Some of the songs bring up Native American issues (without being ""preachy""). Others sing to love while others hearken to the days of the hangmen (My favorite song is ""Two Hangmen"". A perfect record.I found it about a year ago and it has become one of my favorites!!!"
4,Great '70s group!,"In 1970/1971, Sly and the Family Stone performed at Iowa State University. This was right after the movie WOODSTOCK, in which their visually-electrifying performance was a standout, so all of us were excited to see them. The intro band was a group no one (or none of my friends, at least) had heard of, called MASON PROFFIT.Well ... after Mason Proffit, Sly & Co. were a let-down. Mason Proffit ROCKED!!!! I bought in succession their first, their second, and then their third album, and wore them out.Terry Talbot has gone on to Evangelical Christian Rock Music, and his brother John Michael Talbot has become a Catholic monk and recorded many CDs of worship/contemplative music. But I mainly remember them from the days of Mason Proffit, and am glad to see these songs are available on CD to have forever."
4,Pretty good list of repertoire of horn songs,"There are some standard songs on this cd and there are some other songs arranged for the horn. I've listened to a lot of French horn playing and these tracks are pretty good (and I play the instrument). This cd is not one of the standard horn cds that every person should have (see Dennis Brain's recordings of the Mozart Concertos), but this cd will not disappoint. Bottom line, if you play the horn, like the horn, or have never heard the horn, don't pass this cd up because it is a good addition to any collection."
5,Wonderful CD,"This is an amazing CD for French Horn enthusiasts. The last few tracks aren't centered on the FH, which is a disappointment, but the rest of the CD is amazing."
2,Too much time spent on the wrong thing...,"I had such high hopes for this book because I thought Paul was going to be the Paul we'd been introduced to in Michael's story. Wrong! Why Paul put up with Katie, I have no idea. And though I wanted to like her for him, I really didn't get the chance because most of the book was not about THEM, it was about her, her nephew and her messed up sister (don't even get me started on that one!). When Paul did get into the picture, he was more of a fixture, not believable at all. And the ending was SO anticlimactic. Very rushed and not fulfilling."
4,Something different,"I really liked this installment of the New York Blades series. This is not a hot romance story, but more the story of Katie's life after moving back with her mother, with her involvement with Paul being only one part. However, there is so much real emotion in the telling of the story, that it all adds up to a terrific read."
2,Not one of Deidre Martins best,I hate to give this book only two stars but I had a real hard time getting through it. I found myself going ho-hum most of the time. The story could have been more in depth and it seemed like Ms. Martin was just trying to fill up the pages so she could sell a book. The romance was sweet but not as hot as it could have been. I will keep reading her books and hope this is the only one I found to be a dud.
3,Okay... not the greatest book,"This book wasn't bad. It was cute at parts and flowed right along. I have on major complaint. The end seemed rather abrupt. It seems as if our characters had various things to overcome, and *poof* the book ended. I felt like I had bother to read this book and was somewhat disappointed. I don't want to give anything away, but this wouldn't be my first choice for a romantic read."
2,This is terrible,"I didn't like Martin's other books ""Body Check"" and ""Fair Play"", and this one is just as bad. Katie's humor is dry and she tries too hard to be funny when it is not. I particularly do not like stories where the reject-turned-hotty are so easily compliant to the popular jerks that they had a ""crush"" on back in high school. If the guy treated you bad, why would you have feelings for him? Paul is like a big kid stuck in a grown man's body and he was being a prick throughout the entire story. Katie's sister Mina who happened to be a teenage mother is one horrible person to read about. The dialogue is like a convoluted mess. Katie and Paul talk to each other like children, and some of the words spoken are not okay to be said among lovers. I couldn't take this book seriously at all."
5,Penalty Box,"A romance story about hockey players, what's not to like? I love hockey, and play myself, so it was extra fun to discover this series."
2,It just didn't click for me,"I have read all of Deirdre Martin's books and the last two have just fallen flat for me. This one was a bit better than the last, but she is fast losing a must auto-buy from me. I just didn't get the whole I love him, but I don't want anyone to know, but things were being said and done to make sure everyone knew. The ending to me, it just didn't ring true, it was a hurry up and give a happy ending. Hopefully her next book, will be better, may be she needs to write about someone other than hockey players?!"
1,Don't Get This One!,"Only two songs for you! This one's easy to confuse with the other Tori Spark single, which has these two and more! I made this mistake, and now I can't quite justify buying the Spark Maxi CD, which has the most for the money."
2,Jaded,"Jade is a girl caught in the middle of her parents' divorce. They're fighting over custody of her, not because they love her oh-so-much; rather, it's to claim the prize. She doesn't want to take sides, but her parents are putting her into situations where she feels pressure to choose one over the other.Jade's story was a bit repetitive. Parental bickering, choose me, I feel so invisible / like a game piece, second verse same as the first. Also, the creepy internet guy who holds her hostage was ridiculous not scary. Like one reviewer said, it shouldn't be making you laugh but it did. Yeah, this book just didn't hold my interest."
1,A horror book? Get real!,"Oh we should all have such problems...more money than we know what to do with, and parents fighting over us. HA! What a pitiful book to put under beloved VC Andrews name. The books are getting worse and worse and I think it's time for ghost writer to give it up and let someone with a little talent take over. This book isn't a horror story-it's a teen-age joke to be read in about an hour."
2,BORING and I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF READ IT!,"So far I have read all of the other Wildflowers books,Misty,and Star, and I thought for the most part they were interesting but Jade has no ""real"" problems.She's an annoying whiner and I had to force myself to finsh the book.There really is no plot in the book.Let's just pray that Cat will be better.If Cat isn't any better(it can't be any worse) , forget about me buying Into the Garden."
1,A cure for insomnia,"If you ever need a sleep-aid read this book. It was terribly boring and monotonous. This has to be the worst VC Andrews yet, or should I say the worst ghostwriter story yet. He is definitley tarnishing VC's name. I never read one of her books I didn't loke but since she died they haven't been the same. This new series is abousolutely awful, it seems more made for teenagers than adult women. I don't even know if I will buy Cat, but then again I don't see how the books can get any worse than they already are."
5,vcandrews,"Just to let you know. I am an avid reader of vcandrews and I love her books. Usually when I pick one up, I can't put it down until I am finished. I can never wait until the next one comes out. Thanks and keep them comming on."
2,"something to tie you over, for a second..","I found this real boring, there were only some good lines, thats all. Probably the only reason Jade is in the theorpary is because her parents came afford it, it seems. She doesn't seem to have any REAL problems. I had to practically force myself to finish reading. the story and character did not seem to be that much developed."
1,Don't waste your money!,"You thought the ""Orphans"" miniseries was bad? You ain't seen nothing yet. ""Misty"", ""Star"" and now ""Jade"" have nothing in common with our beloved VC Andrews stories about dark family secrets waiting to be unveiled while a poor and rejected heroine beats the odds and grows into a beautiful woman. It is merely the tale of 4 girls from broken homes that meet in a psychologist's office to tell their yawn-inducing personal stories. The non-existant plot reads like an article in ""Reader's Digest"" and even VC Andrews' usual, neverending metaphors seem overbearing and are an unsuccessful attempt to make the story worth reading. If, like me, you are a VC Andrews fan, spare yourself the disappointment and don't waste your money on this one...you're better off digging out the older Andrews novels and reading them again instead."
4,Well Built,"This set is very well built and it is strong. It is a very nice cherry color. The only thing is that I have already put a ding in it, so I have to say that the table top scratches easily. It is not cheap looking or feeling. I am happy with my purchase."
2,If not for the voice,"There's one thing that frustrates me more than anything when it comes to music (no, not being able to play guitar like Angus Young), that is when a really great band/record is let down by the vocals. It happens far too often if you ask me. And this is another example. The music on this record is great! Lovely arrangements of horns and piano's in a catchy 70s piano-pop sense, but Utrillo Kushner's voice is just weak, straining, and to be honest, quite out of tune at times. I'd love to hear someone Jim O'Rourke or Jeff Tweedy sing over these tunes. Now THAT would be a good record."
2,All hype.,"I found this movie to be a bore. It was overacted and it tried too hard to be funny. Paltrow is so awfully boring. If you want to see a real film, check out ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"". Oldman and Roth make an outstanding team. Imagine looking at the ""Hamlet"" story through the eyes of two of it's mere sidemen. Wonderful!"
2,Expected too much.,"Tried to watch it twice, couldn't finish. Good production values I suppose, but best picture? Hardly. Spielberg was robbed."
2,Not worth all the praise,"All right, it is a good movie but it is by no means great. It takes away from Shakespeare's creativity instead of adding to it. Christopher Marlowe even outlines the play's plot for him - making it more his creative genius than Shakespeare's. While it is interesting to see an idea into where the story came from I found it to be trying too hard in many parts. All in all it is worth seeing, but far from the Best Picture award it received."
2,What? 5 stars? Are you guys nuts?,"After hearing of the awards heaped upon this film, I expected great things. How disappointed I was! With a silly plot and over-acting (best actress? Something is strange is going on in Hollywood), this picture is not worth the money or the time."
2,Another example of Hollywood gone bad,"Technically, I suppose this movie deserves some credit. The stage and costumes were exquisite, and, for the most part, the actors seemed to have given their all. It wasn't their fault the flawed screenplay was as dull as a door. I'm sure Shakespeare would be rolling in his grave were he to see some of the historical inaccuracies portrayed here. The use of music was inappropriate. Just about every scene was filled with notes and notes and notes, as if to cue the audience what emotion they should have at that point. Although I feel Paltrow is a fine actress with a stable career ahead of her, her character in 'Sliding Doors' had much more depth. Also, I would have rather seen Colin Firth in the role as Shakespeare instead of Joseph Fiennes."
2,Sappy predictable movie,"This movie is not worth two hours of your time, let alone an oscar for Gweneth. P..lease! Romeo and Julliet is much better than this...(Not the one with Clare Danes...)"
2,"So boring, even my wife hated it...","My wife generally likes ""chick flicks"" of this nature (i.e. well done an and not insulting). But the other big thing a ""chick flick"" needs is that it has to be both romantic and at least moderately entertaining, this film has neither. THERE IS ABSOLOUTELY NO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE LEAD ROLES! 7 awards?!?! Come on, good cinematography and good acting don't make up for a completely empty plot. It was so boring my wife apologized for the fact that I had to sit through it."
2,Best Picture???,"I thought this movie was a cute, cleaver, charming film, but Best Picture??? and what's worse, Best Actress??? Honestly the one truly great aspect of this film in the great and cleaver script! As a writer, this is without a doubt a good one. Though, I urge everyone to go out and see Elizabeth and compare Gweneth's and Cate Blanchet's performances, and you decided which one deserves the Oscar! Gweneth was cute and again charming, though falls flat of portraying true grace, artistry, emotion, and character. In my Opinion, Cate was robbed. As a film student, Shakespere in Love is no where near the movie classics stage and will fade with time. It's a shame ""Oscar"" had to be degraded. Go back and see Elizabeth, and even Saving Pri. Ryan, which in all honesty deserved Best Picture, though if I had it my way, Elizabeth would've won it all."
3,too green,"Okay, so I am not one to criticize the works of Shakespeare, however I do not think that this film deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. The content was wonderful but the acting was not very believable. Fiennes was an adequate representation of a love thirsty playright, but somehow, I did not believe him to be good old Billy. His actions were far too two dimensional for a person of great depth: his facial expressions were meek...if you flipped throught the DVD chapters, Fiennes' affect was only one of dispair and pure elation...sarcasm was lacking or too few. This movie also lacked a great musical score: the theme dragged and had nothing, besides being played on western instruments, to do with the Shakespearean era. As for buying this DVD, I would do it with some reservation because it is no better when watched for the second time. It lacked depth."
5,Wonderful!,"Okay, and why is Joseph Fiennes not nominated? Sheesh! Gwyneth was good, but let's face it, Joe is great as well.The realities of arranged marriage interfere with the greatest love Will and Viola have known, and yet the ending leaves you smiling. Judi rocks, too!"
5,Great Bonus Material,"Besides being a great movie, I found the bonus material to be incredibly intriguing. The DVD has a great segment with the producer, writers, and director discussing the film. Plus there is commentary from both the director as well as the cast can crew. I find this to be so interesting - learning why certain shots were filmed the way they were, background on a character, or how certain sites were chosen. It's a chance to get inside the director's head and see the movie from his perspective."
4,Great Movie,"Great movie overall. I laughed and I cried. Paltrow was okay in the film. I think she had chemistry with Fiennes but her reciting Romeo and Juilet was not jaw opening or enchanting like the protrayed in the movie. The only annoying thing was the fact other people were flat out telling Shakespeare his plays. He just wrote the words and someone else gave him the plot/storyline. Could of done without Ben Affleck lol. Other then that, it was great! Nothing to take to seriously."
4,"A Witty, Entertaining Bit of Fluff","An intelligent, charming, and witty bit of fluff. The Oscar seems to have been both a blessing and a curse for this flick: the nomination no doubt raised its visibility tenfold, but actually winning best picture seems to have damned the film to an eternity of people wagging their heads in frustration and saying it shouldn't have won against ""Saving Private Ryan."" And you know what? Those people may be right, but that really doesn't stop me from enjoying this one enormously. It's a well-made movie, with a script by Tom Stoppard that dares to intelligently engage with and respect the artistic process while simultaneously poking a little good-natured fun at the overwrought seriousness sometimes associated with it. The performances are all engaging - even Affleck manages to be watchable - and the sets and costumes are just stellar. This one may be a romantic lark, but it's a fun one."
4,"Good, Not a 'Great Film'","I must say that in itself, Shakespeare in Love is a good film which I enjoyed greatly. However, when I watched the Oscars I was royally pissed off to see that it had beaten out Saving Private Ryan! The award was for BEST PICTURE dammit, not 'most literate script'. Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red line were, in themselves, both 'Great' pictures in my opinion and in the opinion of many. Good film, not a great film. If you cannot handle the violence from Saving Private Ryan, rent or buy Shakespeare in Love. Thank you for you time :-)"
3,Engaging but not great,"Yes, Gwyneth Paltrow is beautiful and sexy in her role as Shakepeare's love interest. But to give her the best actress Oscar over the much more demanding and complex performance by Cate Blanchett in ""Elizabeth"" wasn't kosher.The costumes and sets were wonderful to behold and the cast did a good job keeping things lively in this romance/farce. But I don't consider this a great movie. It wasn't really that memorable. It was lovely fluff, but nothing more. Entertaining, but not a ""great"" film .If Preston Sturges had gotten a hold of this production, he would have made it sharper with more of a satirical edge. I think that would have made this movie better."
5,Stoppard is brilliant,"Only Tom Stoppard could write a script as complex and entertaining as this one. I suspect that people who don't like this movie missed the point. Filled with references to other Shakespeare works and even Christopher Marlowe and John Webster, it is riotously funny. This is drama and comedy just as Shakespeare wrote it: fast paced, occasionally base, full of puns and jokes, and energized. The performances are great, especially Feinnes, who should have been nominated for an Oscar. It is wild, rollercoaster of a movie that I love. I think William would have loved it, too."
3,"Good Movie, But Overrated","Okay, earlier mentioned about comparing Saving Pvt Ryan with this movie. First, Shakespeare in Love did not portray much in the genre of ""romantic comedy"" and in fact was merely a SHakespeare adaptation film. However, it was a good movie. There's only one problem... This isn't the great point making excellent acting that produces a wild night at the Oscars, but the Academy gave it all to them anyways. Personally, Elizabeth was much better than Shakespeare In Love, and Saving Private Ryan was so exceptional it can almost be viewed as not getting the Best Picture because to give it to them would be such a lopsided decision people could view the decision as unfair.All In All: Good Movie, very buyable, but not the Best Picture caliber movie that everyone thought in My opinion."
5,A very likeable tongue-in-cheek response to Private Ryan,"I rather enjoyed this movie. On one hand it is light and fluffy, yet on the other provides a deeper context in which to enjoy Shakespeare and the Hollywood struggle of the time.A correction, Gwyneth is NOT English.I'm sorry, but talk about predictable. When the old man saluted the headstone in Private Ryan my wife and I wanted to regurgitate the pizza we had eaten earlier. Why do loud noises and flashy explosions coupled with a 20 minute stairway scene (I got the point after the first 5 minutes) equate to a great movie?By the way, if you liked Shakespeare, try renting Rosencrantz and Gildenstern are dead, a play written by Tom Stoppard in the 60's that he made into a movie in early 90's.Thanks for your time."
4,Screamingly funny...but cut the sex!,"I loved this comedy, but the only flaw I saw, or rather turned away from, was the sex. It probably would've gotten a PG rating had it not been for those scenes. As a writer I truly fell in love with the film, as the Will Shakespeare in this story reminds me of a few of my friends who are love-struck."
3,No one dislikes Gwyneth,"No one has anything personal against Gwyneth Paltrow. I felt that Cate Blanchett's role was much more complex than Paltrow's role in SIL. Blanchett had to transform herself from a naive young princess to the wise and resilient Queen Elizabeth in her middle age. Also, Blanchett's character was based on someone who actually lived which means she had the difficult challenge of portraying someone whose personality and life is well-documented. Cate had little room for error in this regard.But I thought that Shakespeare in Love was very entertaining. Everyone in the cast was excellent, and the costumes and sets were wonderful. SIL and Elizabeth took place in the same time period but are totally different genres. I think people got their money's worth in seeing either of these wonderful films!"
4,Shakespeare In Love,"A very, very good film. Not as good as Saving Private Ryan, but very good. I give it 4 1/2 out of 5 stars"
4,FANTASY AND ROMANCE,"This film is brilliant and entertaining and its cast is inspired. However, I refrain from giving it a full five stars because as brilliant as it was, it just was not quite as brilliant as everyone said it was. Gwyneth Paltrow was lovely and charming, but she was not quite as luminous as everyone gushed (in my opinion). The story of Shakespeare fighting writer's block and looking for a muse and falling in love with Viola de Lesseps was an inspired storyline. The cast, from Geoffrey Rush to Rupert Everett as Shakespeare's rival Christopher Marlowe to Judi Dench as Queen Elizabeth, is excellent all around. Joseph Fiennes is the truly luminous performer here, showing Shakespeare as a man of passion and inspiration but all too human nevertheless. The love story is actually feasible and beautiful and tragically illuminates the way toward Shakespeare completing his tragedy Romeo and Juliet. The film is resoundingly beautiful."
4,"Good movie, poorly researched","I liked this movie, however, I was wondering how the script writers could make such a blunder as having Lord Wessex leaving with his bride for his plantation in Virginia. The story is set in 1593, 14 years before the first English settlement in the New World at Jamestown. Funny how Lord Wessex not only arrived 14 years before the rest of his countrymen, but also had a thriving plantation. I'm impressed."
2,"A rip-off of ""No Bed for Bacon""","""Shakespeare in Love"" is fairly amusing. But all its really good, imaginative, funny, moving ideas were stolen - apparently without acknowledgement - from the novel ""No Bed for Bacon"" by Caryl Brahms and S. J. Simon, now out of print, alas. Subtract that material and what is left is mostly infantile humor and a standard offering of nudity."
3,...Good movie,"Well, surely, this is a good, and well made movie. But nothing was very impressive. First of all, I don't like to see a naked body (or nipples) of a heroine. Everything was fine but I thought it lacked some spices. Maybe I had expected too much from this successful film. One question! Is it really difficult to tell a lady who is disguising as a man from a man? Frankly, from this movie, the Kent character was onlything really disturbed me."
3,not so great,"i think the movie was overrated. i thought it was nice because i majored in english literature and enjoyed my shakespeare classes. my friends, the math and science majors, suffered through it."
2,trying to understand people and....,"people's love of this movie! I must have many cultural blind spots or just bad taste in movies.. gosh, who knows... what I think of the movie is that very few movies have bored me more than this one! granted, I know precious little about Shakespeare so I guess I missed many of the jokes that the 'sophisticated' people loved so much.. I remember sitting in the movie theater surrounded by aspiring intellectuals laughing almost all the way through it... I don't remember a genuine laugh coming from me...however, I think I've been known in the past to have a sense of humor, lest anyone thinks I'm just a bore... movie seemed to be quite convoluted and I've seen many movies much more romantic and clever than this one, but like I wrote above, I am probably culturally illiterate and remain simply an ignorant simpleton... I'm glad you intellectuals enjoyed it. (no sarcasm of course)"
2,"""Much Ado About Nothing"".....Literally.","Blah, blah, blah, words, words, words. That's all this movie is filled with. I cannot fathom the fact that this won best picture!!!!!!!!!!!! What were they thinking? The movie was run of the mill and on top of that really, really BOREING.The worst part of the film for me was the way Gweneth was supposed to be a man. I actually ""forgot"" at certain times that she was in drag, and supposed to be playing a man. That's how unconvincing it was to me. You mean to tell me none of those guys actually knew ""he"" was a ""she"". At least make it real for the audience! And this won best picture!?! And as for Judi Dench's performance? Certainly not an oscar worthy. Her costume acted circles around her!All and all, this movie was a tasteless as a scone."
1,A waste of much time and slim talent,"If you look past the hype, and all the beatiful people that populate this ""Film"" you see that most of the actor over act or ( in Paltrows case) dont act at all. It's throguhly boring, dumb and devoid of all wit."
1,You're kidding right?,This movie won Best Picture over Saving Private Ryan? Who was doing the judging and how much were they paid? I tried watching this movie but literally had to turn it off after 30 minutes. Truly unwatchable in my opinion. What tripe.
3,"Liked movie, didnt like the characters","Movie was done well, the acting was wonderful, but the story was not what I would have paid to see.Number one rule for me with movies is: I can be honest on the writing and acting, in this case, both were at least 3 stars, but in this case, I didnt like the characters. Shakespeare plays an adulterer, who is estranged from his wife and children, who falls for the lead female character. I am not fond of characters who have those low moral standards.My husband took me to this movie, because he had heard it was a good date flick, well, not really, unless you find men who are cheating on thier wives romantic and attractive. So that did not make him a highly desirable male character for me to enjoy the story.Much as I did not enjoy the English Patient, I feel I must at least enjoy the character or at least like them, in order to enjoy the movie or story. Otherwise it ends up being a non moving event."
1,Girly,"Did you notice that most people that gave this movie(and Titanic) 5 stars, are women? Makes ya think, don't it?"
1,Just absolutely ronchy!,"I must say this story line could have been quite good. The acting was wonderful, but what absolutely ruined the movie was the number of sex scenes. It seemed as though that was the whole movie. They seemed to appear every five minutes. My friend and I had to turn the movie off. It's too bad for movies like this one that could have great potential and then to be ruined like this."
5,Excellent! One of the best movies I've seen!,Shakespreare in Love is incredibly well acted out with a wonderful job turned in by Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fienes. It captures the time perfectly and the sets are wonderful. I also loved the storyline and how everything was tied together. If I were Siskel & Ebert I'd give it 2 thumbs way up and all my toes too!
3,"Splendid in the theater, but...","...shallow for video. I recommend people see the movie once. Its indulgences are pretty much in Shakespeare's spirit. It would have been nice to have a few new speeches, however."
4,Great film. Disappointing DVD,"The film is everything one expects and more. Brilliant writing. Superior acting. BUT the DVD as advertised above just isn't there! There is no Director's commentary! No deleted scenes! No ""Shakespeare facts""! Indeed, the DVD doesn't even boast the extras that are standard on most. No subtitles. No ""production notes"". No Cast bios. It is the film (and a trailer), and NOTHING ELSE. Fair enough, but it should be sold that way!"
5,Best romantic-comedy Ever!,"""Shakespeare in Love"" was a comical and witty look at a fictional romance occuring in the life of the Bard himself.The storyline was great.The acting was incredible.The costumes and sets looked so real.An excellent movie , worth all 7 Oscars and more...""Life is Beautiful"" was funny,""Elizabeth"" was dramatic,and ""Saving Private Ryan"" was exciting,but ""Shakespeare in Love"" is the grandest of all."
1,Shakespeare in Love (Miramax Collector's Series),"I don't remember buying this one but if I did, it was a gift. I haven't seen it."
2,"What a let down, repeat, what a let down!","If ever there was an over-hyped show that does not live up to expectations it is ""Shakespeare in Love"". In my opinion it was a bore."
2,Blah,"I could hardly sit through this movie. Could Shakespeare really have been so incredibly stupid as to have sex in very public places, with all odds of getting caught, with a girl dressed as a man, (a woman acting at this time was a crime, in which she could be severely punished--if he really ""loved"" her, wouldn't he care more about her safety?). This wasn't love--just pure and simple lust. They never really have any conversations, only recite lines from his play and then jump into the sack. Let's just call it Shakespeare in Bed and be done with it."
2,better preview this one before buying,"Some people agree with the voters who gave this movie its Oscars. Other people don't agree --- I'm one of those people, couldn't understand why all those Oscars. I was disappointed in this film -- expected more after reading all the hype. Tried twice to watch this movie, but couldn't last."
2,UMMMMM....I'VE SEEN BETTER,"I know I am probably the only person in the world to not fall in love with this movie, but I do not love this movie.The story line and plot is amazing. How a woman can want to become an actor. Yet in my personal opinion they could have picked better actors. Yes I am a Gwenyth Paltrow fan, yet her acting seemed at times tiresome. Joseph fines could have added more to his character.The only part of this movie that was the most enjoyable for me was the end."
1,"awful script, mostly bad acting","The customer reviewer from Winston-Salem who posted comments on 8-18-99 expressed my views perfectly. Actaully, it was so terrible I couldn't stand it and turned it off after about 20 minutes. In its favor I can only think to say that at least Paltrow is graceful and attractive; her acting wasn't bad but couldn't overcome the absolutely awful awful script; Dench was inoffensive and may have lent relief from the misery later in the film if she had been featured more and if I had been able to bring myself to watch. Why hasn't anyone commented on how ill Fiennes looked (like a walking corpse)? It struck me as a 90s version of a bad 50s historical adaptation (I know this wasn't an adaptation)...Tony Curtis et al. If you like anachronistic, dumbed-down, almost-lowest-common denominator historical comedy, you'll like this....I prefer Monte Python: at least they have honest pretensions."
1,Horrible!,Am I the only person who hated this film? I was bored to death during it and couldn't wait for it to end. It just shows how little imagination Hollywood has left that they would put out this piece of trash on a brilliant man like Shakespeare. I did not think that Gwyneth Paltrow's acting deserved the Oscar for this one.
2,"** No, not another a chick flick","** No, not another a chick flick, February 7, 2002Revived: Antoine Napolitan from ,massShakespeare in Love was an okay movie. The parts I didn't were when the Queen didn't let Violate be with Shakespeare. Also when they were going to arrest him for nothing. I wouldn't go to see this movie in theaters. I might not even rent it, but if it was on television or on a movie channel I probably would watch it. I don't think its fiction on his life I think its real. Also I like the fact that he wrote most of his stories were about his life."
1,bad movie,"i saw this movie and man seriously it was horrible. if you have any semblance of good taste, please steer clear of this awful movie. robbed many other worthy competitors at the Oscars. the only thing worse would be a sequel."
1,"Ha ha ha, what a stupid movie!","I'm still wondering the whole point of the movie to this very day. I mean, I get the whole ""Shakespeare has some sorta 'writers' block' thing, and that this chick dresses up as a man to be in a play of his ...and they end up making steamy passionate love one nite...but damn! This movie was nominated for an Oscar...BR>..."
4,not my favorite but quite nice,"It's a lovestory with convincing actors, especially the two main characters(played by Joseph Fiennes&Gwyneth Paltrow) and Judi Dench in her role of Queen Elizabeth I.The audience gets an relatively realistic insight into the Elizabethan Age and its culture as far as this is possible in a movie.The lovestory with Shakespeare has parallels to ""Romeo&Juliet"" that is written by Sh. during the movie.Result: Not my favorite one but quite nice"
5,A Very Witty Movie,I did not know who playwright Tom Stoppard was until after viewing this movie. Now I know. This movie will define his work in future years for all students of film. It is a very subtle satire of the life of one of the greatest writers who has ever lived.
3,Choose of Actress and Screenwriting could be better,"Mr. Fiennes did a good job of being Shakes, but If I were Shakes, I would tell the director change the leading actress from Paltrow to Emmanuelle Beart, or any better actress (there are plenty of better actress who can speak English Accent). The directing was not bad, and the script was made of literary dialoges, which was good, but the screen writing made no suprise, and less taste."
2,Slick love,"There are enough of your typical drama student jokes to make this film amusing, and the anachronisms are great, but the romance in the movie is just too slick. There is no questioning of love as the characters simply move through the motions. They meet, immediately fall in love, society prevents their love, and they are forced to separate. An enjoyable if not very thought provoking movie on love. Shakespeare's original had more to say."
2,NUDITY NOT NECESSARY!!,"An entertaining, but somewhat offensive look at what ""might have been"", but I was disappointed that it had so little depth. It's called a comedy, yet wasn't all that funny. Also not enough substance to be classified as a drama. The many references to other ""Bard"" works does NOT transform it into a fantastic, artistic masterpiece. The sexual relationships could have been IMPLIED without spelling them out so unnecessarily, and the acting, although good, wouldn't go down in history as exceptional if it hadn't been handed an Oscar for Best Picture. When you compare it to classics in the past (of different genres) such as It's A Wonderful Life, High Noon, North By Northwest, Ben-Hur, and Chariots of Fire; Shakespeare in Love just doesn't begin to come up to those standards of great films. It's entertaining, and amazingly enough was awarded Oscars, but for all but its most ardent fans, this one will fade into the past as just another entertaining, but not GREAT, movie."
5,Much Ado about Writing,"Writing a play is a tiresome burden when you don't have the faintest idea what it is going to be about but you need to hand it over real soon. Fortunately, Will Shakespeare finds his muse and the authors of the screenplay also had at least a brief encounter with theirs.Basically a romantic comedy SIL offers much more that the standard ""boy meets girl, boy loses girl"" scenario - they present it in a fantastically well rendered setting taking as much as they could from the Swan of the Avon.A perfect way to spend an afternoon - you get your share of romance, adventure, and literary history (the latter should not be taken at face value, however). Do you need more?"
4,nice movie,"shakespeare in love is a nice romantic movie, that should be watched with some girls and a lot of chocolate, for it is really sentimental. It also teaches you some facts about shakespeares time and maybe some people who like the language shakespeare uses will start to read romeo and juliet after watching this movie.the actors performed very well."
5,awesome... shakespeare would have loved it,"Beautifully written. The screen was filled with vibrance with characters that seemed truly involved in their roles. The director, cinematographer, and the costumes made Shakespeare in Love a truly remarkable film."
3,Overrated,"This movie wasn't bad, and had some great acting and a very entertaining plot, but it has been so overrated. It is nowhere near good enough to be considered for an Oscar, and Gwyneth Paltrow, while by no means a bad actress, is neither stunning nor phenomenal, and in fact gave a rather shallow performance (she was better in 'Emma'). The entire movie was stereotypically ""Hollywood"". This film is worth seeing and is very entertaining, but it is not superb and should not be rated as such."
3,ALL IT LACKED WAS A GREAT SCRIPT,"The sound quality of the movie was terrific as was the photography and the costumes. The acting, especially of Gwyneth Paltrow and Joseph Fiennes was top notch. The fast pace and the premise were great. Where this movie really falls apart is in the lacklustre script. What could have been so funny simply isn't. I bought the video hoping to find a really entertaining and comical romp. Instead, I found something to put me to sleep at night. A shame."
2,Drowning in syrup.,"There are three problems with this movie: (1) it tries to be too clever; (2) Joseph Fiennes is an outrageous fop (remember British TV's 'Famous Five' TV series? - he reminds me of Georgina) and (3) Gwyneth Paltrow is a simpering drip. What is it with this woman and acceptance speeches? It's getting to the point where she can't even unwrap a Mars bar without bursting into tears and thanking her parents for giving her the courage to do it. This would be an OK movie if it were just a little more understated, but the whole thing is so self-impressed and mawkish you feel like you're choking on honey. Avoid."
5,my review,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.The actors, the setting, the costumes, the music, everything is so captivating and they all work together to make this movie an unforgetable experience.The story, just by itself is so well thought out! I thought I knew everything about Shakespeare before I saw this movie, but I learned so much more. Even my 9 year old son watched it with me and learned about Shakespeare and about the making of 'Romeo and Juliet'. I don't think he will ever forget this story.A must see."
4,"Classic, Beautiful Love Story","This Shakespearean tale is a love story for those of us who are tired of slapstick, prefabricated, formulaic, mass-media-targeted 'flicks.' Here is a film which includes culture, education, intellect, and skillful acting/directing. There were a few moments of lull, but generally moves along quite well. Interesting and soul-stirring, this is not your average love story; beautiful and sentimental. See it with the one you love."
1,Everyone involved with this movie should be ashamed!,"If you respect and admire William Shakespeare, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It will insult your intelligence. Period."
1,It's not worth the money.,"It's not worth the awards, or all the glamour it received. What a waste. I vote half a star, if even that."
1,"If I could give this horrible movie no stars, I would!!!","I was shocked when Shakespeare In Love won Best Picture and Best Actress. This movie is good enough, I suppose, for a cheap chick flick, but where's the chemistry? Where's the grace and artistry that Gwyneth Paltrow was supposed to possess in abundance? As a fan of the Elizabethan era, I can only hang my head in shame that such a film was produced. Trust me, if you want a movie that truly shows the Elizabethan era and is worthy of all the Oscars it was robbed of, try Elizabeth. Cate Blanchett was absolutely stunning in this film, more convincing in her demanding role as Queen Elizabeth that Gwyneth Paltrow could ever hope to be."
1,What I saw of it.....,"I can't honestly review this movie because I didn't see it all. It was too boring to watch. I rented this movie because I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about at the Oscars. After the first half hour or so of this movie I had to hit the ""OFF"" button. I cannot understand for the life of me the appeal of G. Paltrow. There are so many better out there. I can see after only a half hour of this movie that Saving Private Ryan was ripped off when it lost the Oscar."
1,At Least I'm Honest,"First of all, I don't like to watch movies about dirty people. Dirty, (needs to take a bath kind of dirty), rotten teeth, do I want to go to the movies to see that? So this movie was supposed to be so funny, so clever, so original, so witty. I found it to be mostly repulsive. And for romantic? It was people lusting for each other like two high school kids with over-active hormones. There wasn't much ""romance"" in here for me.Just for the record, I enjoy the plays of William Shakespeare. I love to read his sonnets. But as for this movie, much ado about nothing."
1,Prepare to be disappointed,"If you are a lover of Shakespeare, English and/or period movies, be prepared to be extremely disappointed with this movie. If you really want to own a DVD or video of this movie, rent it first. If you like Judi Dench, you may want to buy it for this reason alone, then you can scan the part where she is shown, otherwise this movie is not worth watching again or worse, owning. This is the first movie I've seen of Gwyneth Paltrow and I think this is the main reason why I could care less if I see another movie with her on the cast. Paltrow is dry and artificial. This movie is so ridiculous, it is almost insulting. Not even Judi Dench's magnificent performance (as always) could save it."
1,Lame and overwrought,How did this win the Academy Award?! I guess because it is a movie theater people and the Academy is composed of theater people? The script is predictable and formulaic. Fienes's performance is unbearably earnest.
1,Pablum for the pseudo-literate,"The allegedly ingenious and highbrow humor of this film is based almost entirely on the gimmick of contriving to have ""real life"" references for things ultimately stuck in Shakespeare plays, and then a cute idea in SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN. Here it just seems stupid. What really drove me nuts was certain members of the audience were laughing hysterically every time it happened. Yet there is no real cleverness applied to the technique, merely the humor of recognition. I felt the audience members were laughing excessively in order to prove how ""literary"" they were for recognizing the HAHAHAHAHAHA !!!! You see WE know NOW that it became Romeo and Juliet ! Get it ? And it was MARLOWE ^V who might have written Shakespeare's plays - who gave him the idea for the final title. Get it ? GET IT?Neither do I."
4,Fun romp of a movie,I enjoyed all the beautiful language and the (contrived) storyline. Gwyneth is so fun to watch. Wonderful costumes and groovy sets.
3,see it for joseph fiennes,"he sure is yummy! gwyneth paltrow, on the other hand, is an annoying skank."
2,Boring til end,"Ok Until the end of the Movie this movie was Borin, the costumes were good but i must amit That i was very displeased when it won Best Film And for that alone I know it was rigged (arnt they all) plz don't buy this film you can rent it if you must but you will be VERY disappionted if you spend 30 bunks on this movie alas The women will love it, men I suggest That sit this one out."
2,An Boring-okey satire,This is almost perfect but for a couple of dreadful scenes especially the ending it's quite not that good baby. So if you want a nosensible movie see Shakesphere In Love .
2,Belongs on that long list of overrated garbage...,"The concept of ""Shakespear in Love"" may have its compelling points: Shakespeare writes his tragedy ""Romeo and Juliet"" while falling in love with a ""forbidden"" woman. Unfortunately, a 1990s flavor spoils the beautiful sets and costumes. Romance and love are reduced to a string of lustful sexual encounters (and the courtship is short). Viola shows all of the modern attitudes that Rose did in ""Titanic"" - horribly out of place, and downright depressing. Shakespeare is portrayed little better. Despite ""Shakespeare in Love""'s moments of clever comedy and the very well acted ""Romeo and Juliet"" scenes (maybe enough for 2 and a half stars), the shallowness pours from the movie and sinks it. Another example of why the Oscars are most often a joke."
3,Movie for Women only?,"Shakespeare in Love is a movie mainly designed for commercial success, as most movies are, but in this movie this point comes out very clearly. Even though that things don't fit in the plot, they are in the movie, because the viewers just expect them. This contributes to the flat storyline.The target audience is definitely women. 80% of this movie is a sentimental lovestory. There are some funny dialogues and some intelligent turn points in the story, but they are clearly in the minority. Shakespeare would never like a movie like that. Action beneath the surface is not represented, but simple stereotype characters act in their typical way. Maybe women like that, just like they like BSB or NSync, but anyone who cannot stand these Boygroups won't enjoy this movie."
3,......................y a w n......is it finished yet!!?,"This is by no means awfull but it's just a bit dragged out and too much like hard work. I can't believe anything here in this film deserves any oscars, I mean....there is better acting in cack films like Species 2...ok....maybe I'm going a bit far but you know what I mean....nothing here thats worthy. The story line is very predictable which was frustrating cosidering you've guessed the storyline and this film goes on and on but I just enjoyed watching it for the shakespear one-liners and the ocasional bit of humour. Saving Private Ryan is 10 times better than this and deserves all the oscars that this film stole from it.......there is no justice!!!"
2,Ending suggests love was in fact a fling,"The last few very disappointing minutes of this movie breaks from the comparison of this couple to Romeo and Juliet, making it neither tragic, satisfying, clever, nor romantic. That Juliet could walk away from Romeo, and that Romeo would let her, is just flat disappointing."
5,a pleasant romp through Merrie Olde Englande,"First, this is a comedy, not a documentary, or serious work. It is a romantic comedy, and by those standards it succeeds wonderfully. It is smart, semi-historical (Marlowe, and John Webster, who did grow up to write some pretty macabre plays) although the first scene where Will is getting psychoanalyzed should tell you not to include anything from this movie on a term paper.But the acting is fine, the plot is delightful, and the directing is suburb. Geoffrey Rush gives a wonderful performance, and Ben Affleck does a pretty mean Ned Allyne. It is interesting to see Imelda Staunton of Harry Potter fame (Dolores Umbridge) and Jim Carter of Downton Abbey (Mr Carson) in very different roles.This is a great date night movie, smart yet entertaining. It does not try to be more than it is, and what it is is pretty good."
2,Not much depth and it won best picture?!?,"The best thing abot this movie was Joseph Fiennes. Gwyneth Paltrow's performance wasn't worth anything, all she did was hop into bed with Fiennes and yell one liners. (Oscar should've gone to Cate Blanchett, but at lest she got the BAFTA) The best picture should have gone to (need I say it) Saving Private Ryan. I was disappointed by this movie. The Academy always tries to hate on Spielberg. But there were good parts, like Dench and Affleck. But the rest wasnothing but light fluff."
2,"Forsooth, it doth give love a bad name","Am I the only person in the world who found this movie less than enthralling/endearing! Perhaps Miramax, as part of its astounding marketing blitz, turned everyone else into pod people and only I am left to sound the alarm? Although I tend to be a purist when it comes to films of Shakespeare's plays, I'm not utterly closed minded. But this ""romp"" was too cutesy by far. Fiennes was pallid, Dench and others were wasted, and Paltrow ... argh!: the start of the appalling Gwynethmania of the last couple of years (although I liked her in ""Sliding Doors""). . . . much ado about nothing, if I may coin a phrase."
2,Shakespeare in Lust,"Well, its not Shakespeare, if that's what your expecting. Its more like a movie production of a cheap romance novel. The name of the greatest writer of the millennium is used to give legitimacy to a piece of fluff. Women can get their hormones going under the ruse of experiencing high art. Its a chick flick, nothing more."
2,"Drab, Dry, Overall the Worst Film Associated w/Shakespeare","I don't feel it was clever or witty. In fact, the humor was a little off base for me, personally. I often drifted off in thought during dialogue. The only joy I recieved from watching the film was the direct words of Shakespeare's poetry (aka. Romeo and Juliet). The characters were plain, the plot slow and lacking clarity. Also, the character Rosaline was irritating and grotesque. Sexuality in female characters has been polluted enough with poor and ugly symbolism. Why continue to keep it so unnecessarily crude? Gwen is sweet and Shakespeare comes across as a naive, weak, confused and uninspired character. Purely heterosexual, ofcourse. I was expecting more depth and originality. But, it is nothing but plain, old mainstream entertainment in the end."
3,much ado about nothing,"simply put , romeo and juliet was written before their were plantations in va. thus an underlying plot melodramatic pt was invalid, date of authorship is 1591 or 1596: our undying fascination with the british royalty amidst amazing poverty , with a relishing of the tudors brutality and sadism is far to prevalent in the media these days ie the other boleyn"
5,Being there and the movie lived on and on and on,"The moivie was so much better than I ever dreamed. It passed the test for good art. And in accord with classical tradition, a real catharsis takes place in the reader (viewer) . I was so into this movied that I sobbed for a long time at its conclusion. The cast was very good, the sets so real ,I really thought and felt I was right in there. It seemed that the bard himself had writen the play(movie)."
5,Outstanding,"This movie is SO smart, well acted, and well-written. Everyone should be forced to watch this movie to see how popular films can be intelligent, sexy, and fun. Each time that I watch this movie I find a different detail that I previously missed. It's worth watching several times and it's worth recommending to friends."
5,The best movie I've seen in years!!!,"Do you like action? - it's here! Do you like romance? - it's here! Ilicit sex? - Yep! Comedy? - Believe it! This film was satisfying on every level. Repeat viewings do not lessen the pleasure, but increase the understanding. You don't have to know your Shakespeare to thouroughly enjoy this film, but it helps."
4,Entertaining but with a glaring anachronism,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film--the acting, the sets and costumes, and the attention to period detail. The fictional unfolding of ""Romeo and Juliet"" was brilliantly done. However, I was shocked when Colin Firth referred to his ""plantation in Virginia"" and, again, at the end of the film, spoke of going to Virginia with his bride. This film supposedly takes place in 1589 and the first English settlement in Virginia was in 1607 (Jamestown). And, it was a good many years after that before there were any established plantations. Somebody goofed on this one!! Aside from this, wonderfully witty and entertaining film."
2,Shakespeare does Titanic...Ta-Dahhh!,"Like so much Shakespeare I've seen on stage or screen for the last 40+ years, this is not William so much as it is Earnest Shakespeare, with little magic in the handling of the language but plenty of big music, spectacular costumes & lots of nyah-ha-ha acting. A pity because every generation seems to become more distanced from the real poetry that should be there. Today, it all seems to have become_show & tell, you-are-there, reality-tv presentation. Interesting that Stoppard was involved in this and 15 Minute Hamlet which was far more in the spirit of the Bard."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE!!!,"This may not be the worst movie ever made but it comes pretty darn close! From reading the other reviews I knew that I would either love it or hate it, and obviously I HATED IT!!! There was NOTHING entertaining about this movie - from the unconvincing love story and transparent plot to the frenzied performances. Don't bother with this one!And while we're on the subject - How anyone can compare this movie with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is incomprehensible. Personally, I thought PRIVATE RYAN was a bit graphic for my taste, but it is a brilliant film and is destined to become a classic. Meanwhile everyone will be referring to this farce as ""that bit of Shakespeare nonsense."""
1,"Oh my God, this is terrible!",This is a terrible movie from a terrible director with a terrible cast to go along with its terrible story.
1,Shakespeare In Love,"This movie looks very attractive before seeing it, but it is actually boring to tears. It is more 'Shakespeare' than 'Shakespeare IN LOVE'. I would recommend anybody to skip it, as it would be a serious waste of money buying it. The ending was very weak. I am rating this video 1 star, as there is no option for zero."
1,An insult to and a corruption of Shakespeare...,I was disgusted at the movie. It was insulting to Shakespeare and utterly meaningless and stupid. Why portray Shakespeare in such a way? Can we not just respect and learn from him? What is the reason for a revolting love story using Shakespeare's honorable name?Give me a break... this society can do better. (I hope!)
2,How?,"How could this bit of froth have stolen away Saving Private Ryan's rightfully-earned Best Picture Oscar? Sure, it's clever, but... well, it ain't Shakespeare."
1,True Tragedy,"I saw this in the theater, and while semi entertaining, did not move me. I watched it again day before last and though I appreciate the costumes (some discrepancies), the music, and the ending which truly saved this movie from being absolutely rancid I still cannot get past the fact that this beat out Saving Private Ryan as Best Picture.Saving Private Ryan stuck with me for days, weeks, and now years, I forgot this drivel an hour after I watched it. Forget Romeo and Juliet, forget the heartbroken 'Will' Shakespeare, the only real tragedy was that this movie won Best Picture."
2,Romeo & Juliet is the best part,"Well, who even reads these things? But maybe I can offer a little counterpoint. Sure it's dull. Sure, it contains every Hollywood cliche (follow your dream, don't let people get in your way, sex between people is good as long as they are attractive). Sure it panders to people who would like to look intelligent while they knowingly chuckle at the in-jokes. This is Titanic for the I-graduated-from-college crowd. Doomed romance, lots of creeps in the way, a passionate man (so passionate he abandoned his wife and children) and a ditzy female who looks great naked. And yet, the portions of R&J (carefully edited so we never see the early portion of the play where the dingy Romeo is smitten with Rosalind) are exquisite, making me realize yet again why Shakespeare is a writer for the ages and Stoppard is not. Every good line in this film is Will's."
2,Pretentious and arty,"This movie will certainly be popular and rate with critics. However, it is pretentious and arty in the anticipated Hollywood manner. Furthermore, it takes too many liberties with a historical personality. We know little about the life of Shakespeare, and we certainly should not read his plays autobiographically. But one thing we do know from his writings is that he valued marital fidelity. If he ever violated this standard, he was certainly shamed by his own conscience. He would never have celebrated his lawless love. It is too bad that millions of folk, forgetting that this oh-so-serious production is fiction, will get their lasting impression of England's prime cultural hero here."
1,Stooopid (what I saw of it between zzzzzz's),"This is the best movie they could come up with without blowing stuff up? I was hoping for something fun or perhaps a sweet romance...slim pickings here. Annoyingly full of itself and quasi-subliterate. The actors looked dumb, too --that Fiennes guy, especially, bored me. This is a movie that thinks its all that & got a lot of 'mo-spaiens to nod along but hasn't got much there there. You may rightly (and unapologetically) consider yourself smarter and more discerning than others if you disdain this piece of business."
1,Would you Adam and Eve it?,"Make a nice set and clad a couple of famous actors and actresses in pretty clothes and anything will get the thumbs up! What a load of steaming garbage this movie is!!! What the hell is all the fuss about? And just who gave Ben Affleck the idea that he could act at all, let alone trying to get him to speak with an English accent. Horrible! But, of course, it had to be done - they had to put an American in there somewhere, just to make sure it sold in the US! Shallow!I am in awe that such a dull and shallow story could captivate people in this way."
4,I was skeptical,"I love Shakespearean plays. I enjoy the films made by Kenneth Brannaugh (sp?). I despise the hacked up renditions you usually find, so going by the title, I was very skeptical.However, this movie - taken for the light hearted gem it is - was very enjoyable. I laughed, I felt for the characters, I cheered.Recommended for watching after a tough day's work."
4,Great enhancement to your railway,This stop & go crossing has many uses if you are running battery powered Brio trains:1. It can be used as a normal crossing where no trains are stopped (put the control bar in the middle position).2. It can be used as a normal stop track (put the control bar in one of the side positions).3. It can be used to avoid collisions if you are running a multi-train railway as it can be set up to stop the traffic in one of the directions.I have not regretted buying this product. In a not-too-simple Brio railway setup it adds both fun and educational value.
3,This one's a grower,"This is an album I hated at first, but I thouroughly enjoy it now. Every Plankeye album sounds different, and this one has a radio pop-rock feel, somewhat like Thrid Eye Blind. Of course, with this being the great Plankeye, these songs contain a lot more depth than most radio garbage. ""Fall Down"" is absolutely beautiful, and paints a perfect picture of the struggle against oneself. Some of the more punk sounding cuts are good too. Most of these songs took a lot of getting used to though, and I still can't stand a couple of them. Over all, a good pop rock album with lots of depth for the genre."
1,ifashionmall.com,HORRIBLE customer service. Very slow at responding via email and doesn't honor their 5% off policy if email isn't addressed within 24hours. And sends the wrong merchandise and doesn't refund the return shipping costs.
1,Will work but,"I tried this product to trim up some ceramic tile it will cut the tile but took me almost 45 minutes to cut a piece 6"" long decided to use my tile nippers on the couple of oieces i needed to trimwould not recommend this product"
4,"Good light, but battery replacement gets harder with age","A friend gave me one of these and I used it for about a year with some success. Another reviewer wrote about the problem changing the 2nd battery -- I agree. But changing that battery got harder over time and I had to throw the light out after a year because the electrical connection became bent beyond my ability to manipulate it. It does come with a 5-year warranty, but the light is only $5 or so I plan to just buy a new one."
4,Great light!,"We like this light a lot. Easy to see in dark. Only complaint is to stay away from large dog version to get same sized light with smaller hook to keep out of dog's mouth. Also, helpful to reinforce with clear packing tape to keep intact."
4,Works great!,These little lights work great. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because we have little dogs (20 lbs. and under) and it would be nice if they were a little smaller.
3,Pet Strobe Light,Purchased 4 lights and 1 stopped working after about 5 uses. The other 2 that I am using work great for walking dogs in the dark.
4,Good for Christmas time,"This ball is quite big, bigger than golf ball sized.It will not make a good light for backpacking dogs because of the size/weight (even big dogs). This was my original intention for it.However, it does look a lot like a Christmas tree ornament, so I'm going to keep it and decorate my dog with it at Christmas. :)"
3,"Works just as advertised, but my dog hates it.","This thing works just as advertised with very bright flashing LEDs that you can see from every angle. The only problem is that it's bulky (about 5 cm in diameter, somewhere between the size of a ping pong ball and a small tangerine). My dog absolutely hates it... it hangs down from the collar and bounces all over the place when he runs (or even walks). The strobe is also very disorienting for him, since it is in his inferior visual field. It's not very heavy, but it is heavy enough that he feels it weighing him down. If you have a large dog (>60 pounds), or if you dog is insensitive to bulky things around his/her neck, this may work just fine. Otherwise I would recommend a smaller clip on light. We now use the Flashing Strobe Safety Light, which also has an always-on function. It is not visible from every angle, but it is light (although the clip is very cheap and will probably break soon)."
2,"The light is great, the hardware is not!","The silver bits aren't metal - they are painted plastic. The first time this dropped on the ground, the clip broke right off.I put a key ring through the smaller ring and attached it to a better clip, so it is still functional. It's too bad the clip wasn't made better, the light is bright and has a good strobe."
5,An enjoyable and interesting read.,"Deep Black was great reading, one of those books you don't want to put down until it is finished. Having been acquainted with Black Canyon for many years this book answered questions that had been a puzzle to me for a long time. Robb's diligence in learning about the history relating to the trip made by A.L. Fellows and W. Torrence was much appreciated and it was interesting to learn that even writers in the early 1900's could not refrain from spicing up their stories. The first hand account the reader gets of the experience Robb and Michael had in traveling through the canyon makes one appreciate even more the task undertaken by Fellows and Torrence."
5,typically amazing Finn fare!,"Earlier this year I went to Neil Finn's first concert for this album in Dunedin, New Zealand, and well - he stunned the audience. I love this album, it combines all the elements of Split Enz and Crowded House that I love."
2,A Major Disappointment,"Neil Finn is without doubt one of the best songwriters of this era. With Crowded House his tunes were mixed with ever more innovativness reaching a pinnacle with Together Alone, among the best albums of the last decade. Try Whistling This sadly shows that he needs a tight unit to breathe life and energy into his songs. There are exactly two outstanding tracks on this release, the catchy summer tune She Will Have Her Way and the spooky Sinner. Most of the rest lacks the spark that Crowded House seemed to produce in their sleep. A few tracks are even hardly b-side material. Neil obviously needs a group of musicians around him, not session players, to highlight his own talents."
1,El Crapo,"Hey Tim, why don't you wait until you have enough good songs to fill out an album? There's no need to hurry and release ""product."" When you do that you start making smelly albums like this. Pee-you."
1,Very disappointed!,"I searched for a CD that featured whistling and this CD was among the results. I listened to over half of the CD without hearing a single note of whistling ... and I assume there is none on the rest of the CD either.Needless to say, I am quite disappointed!"
5,Another Collection of Tunes That Are *Finn-tastic*,"Neil Finn's first solo album like most of his other work, takes several listens to appreciate it's depth and richness. In this case I hope he gets the attention long deserved for a well produced CD.This disk is somewhat of a departure from the Crowded House ""pop"" sound being a bit psychedelic and moody. However, I highly recommend this CD to Split Enz or House fans, or for that matter anyone interested in good quality tunes."
3,Worht the Effort,"This is a very difficult album ro ""get into."" I consider myself a major Finn fan, and I felt like crying the first time I heard it. On first listen, most of the songs are slow, dirge-like ballads, which are hard to distinguish from one another. There are few ultra-catchy songs in the vein of the ""Woodface"" or ""Crowded House"" albums. (""She...Way is the exception.} Fortunately, the songs sound better with each listen. After about six spins, I can tell the songs apart, and most of them are very good. The best are the aforementioned ""She will have her way"" and ""Truth."" Some of the songs are very long, it seems, and others are hampered by a lack of structure, having no refrain. Still, unlike some albums, you can listen to this for months and hear something new each time. The songs are hard to get to know, but it's well worth ehe effort."
4,"Strong, but less accessible than earlier outings","I am a very big fan of the Finn brothers and Crowded House.This album is rich, dense and subtle - it will probably take many listens to fully appreciate it (the hallmark of an excellent album). 'Sinner' and ""She Will Have her Way' are exceptional tracks.Nevertheless, I miss the humour and warmth of the Crowded House recordings. Something about this album doesn't quite engage the heart."
4,Moving,"I was bummed when i first listened to this album. It sounded like it was no fun to make. What kept me coming back to it i guess was its soulfulness. At first i thought, ""contractual obligation,"" but now i just hear sweet sympathy and quiet joy."
2,Can do better . . .will do better.,"So much bollocks is written about Neil Finn and his prowess as a songwriter. I was delighted to hear that amongst the two or three really memorable songs, there's an awful lot of padding. It just proves that the man is mortal. His next solo offering will be the one to judge him by. He may have then dispensed with some of the 'studio toys' which render some of these songs as mildly irritating."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I've never been into crowded house or neil finn before. But I heard ""Sinner"" on the radio..then ""She Will..."" a few weeks later. Not often do I take the plunge and buy an album after hearing a 'radio tune'. This was a pleasant surprise. It was difficult to listen to at first - too heavy. It grows on you though. The music has so many intricate layers of sound and fascinating effects"
4,Much better live,"The problem with this otherwise wonderful record is the muddy, try-too-hard-to-be-dense production that came to the fore with ""Together Alone,"" the last CH album. The songs are as strong as always, though, and when I saw Neil in concert at the Fillmore in San Francisco I was overwhelmed by the quality of the new work. The record sounds completely different to me now. For the better."
5,Simply the best CD available today,"After seeing his concert on this tour and not really knowing which Finn brother I was about to see, I was blown away by this performer's music. It's a combination of listening and feeling. I found myself being pulled by the melody and moving with the rhythm all the while entranced by the story: ""I'll walk this earth like some unforgotten soldier"". If you buy only one CD this year...buy this one."
4,"Terrific, thoughtful pop from a great songwriter","When I heard a snippet of ""She Will have her Way"" on a New Zealand RealAudio radio station, I knew I had to get this CD. My first impression was that it was very mid-tempo, without the quirky pop highs of his previous work. But the album has blossomed with repeated listenings, and it's a wonderful one. ""Souvenir"" and ""King Tide"" rival the above track for sticks-in-your-head catchiness, and the slower tunes are quite beautiful once you stop expecting to hear Crowded House and just listen. There are many lovely, emotional moments on this album, and it's a strong statement that Neil Finn will be making great music for a long time to come. It's been quite a joy for me, and is my 2nd fave album of the year so far (behind Midnight Oil's Redneck Wonderland, which may soon be surpassed by The Church's upcoming Hologram of Baal)."
2,Great album Terrible product,"This is one of the best albums I have ever heard by Neil Finn, as good as anything he did with Crowded House. My original copy was lost and so I decided to get a new one. This re-issue is very poorly made and the sound was like a cheap MP3 copy, it even looks like something you'ld buy in Chinatown. I was very disappointed."
1,Shoddy shoddy - shame on the record co!,"Was given this great album for my birthday last week, and sad to say must return it. Shoddy mastering, just awful. You'd think at least, with an artist of this stature, they'd remaster, but no. Great album, pisspoor run."
1,"Bad pressing, bad mp3!","I'm a huge Neil Finn fan, and bought this back in 1998. Lost my hard copy, and purchased one just a few weeks ago. Bad pressing, which I'm sorry to say carries on here! If you listen to ""Addicted"", there's breakup on the low end all over the place. Amazon needs to demand the record company fix this and replace everything, including the mp3's."
2,Try listening to this,"Aside from ""Sinner"" and ""She Will Have Her Way,"" it appears that the usually brilliant singer-songwriter has lost his touch. Don't believe the five star reviews. Where are the hooks? One more like this and it's ""Hey now, hey now, your career is over."""
2,"Surprisingly, a snooze","Wow. Only two songs out of this whole album even approximate Neil's customary brilliance (""Sinner"" and ""Truth""). This is the very least-involving CD he's ever made, further testament to the fact that comfy home and hearth often make musicians very dull boys. Almost makes me wish he would have another falling out with his brother or stray from the marriage bed again -- such terrible events seemed to light a fire under him (e.g. ""Temple,"" parts of ""Woodface,"" ""Together Alone,"" ""Finn Bros.""). Tsk, tsk."
2,what a disappointment,"Michael Bruce was an essential part of the Alice Cooper group. However his attempt at a solo album falls flat! The CD seems poorly produced & mixed sounding very weak & tinny. It does have it's moments ""Lucky Break"" & ""If the Sky should fall"" are good but songs like ""King of America"" and the title track are sickening to listen to. It's an ok disk but anyone hopin that Michael recaptured some of the magic that was the Alice Cooper group will be VERY disappointed."
1,what a waste of time,"When the book came out it was ahead of it's time and had some good moments. This movie is a different story. Although Depp tries hard to save this movie it is so contrived, banal, and boring, that it is a waste of time and money. No wonder there are so many used copies for sale."
1,Two Hours That You Will Never Get Back,"I will preface this review by stating that I have never read the book upon which this movie is based. I purchsed this DVD based upon the list of actors. I was truly disappointed with this movie in that I kept waiting for something -- anything -- reasonable and sensible to happen. Alas, it was not forthcoming. The continual narration by Depp's character did not work for me as it really did not add anything close to approximating coherency. The cameo by Bussey was good; however other than that watch this movie only if you are familiar with the book and have an extra two-hours of your life to spend."
2,Let's Grow Old and Fat and Drunk and Stoned Together,"I was ""treated"" to Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro in ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" on DVD. Based on the late journalist Hunter Thompson's book, this one had a few very funny moments, and the not-so-subtle message that real-life in Las Vegas can be as hallucinogenic as a drug trip, but spent too much time showing us how people on drugs walk funny and trash hotel rooms and rental cars (without paying their bills, of course). It was a step up from Bill Murray in ""Where the Buffalo Roam"", an earlier attempt to bring Thompson's antics to the screen, but still a pretty low step."
1,Fearful and loathsome,"I've never seen anything as repulsive as this. It is supposedly a gonzo, drug-induced, stream of consciousness romp through Las Vegas involving 2 dysfunctionally stoned and crazed individuals. It is a waste of time, altogether missing whatever mark it set. If you must see it, do so on an empty stomach. One reluctant star for the authentic 1971 look of the film."
1,Sheer torture,"Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas remains the only movie I have ever walked out on at the theater. I like the actors (Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro), I like the director (Terry Gilliam), and I also understand there was not supposed to be a ""plot"" per se, but more of a stream-of-consciousness approach dealing with how drug trips can seriously mess people up. Despite all this, I absolutely HATED this film. It was painful to watch - an utterly wretched affair of bizarre confusion and mayhem. Watch if you must, but you have been warned. I would recommend seeing some of Gilliam's other (very fine) films, such as Time Bandits, 12 Monkeys, or Brazil instead."
5,Buyer Beware,"Don't worry about the content if you know the movie is a hilarious drug-induced adventure in insanity, and Las Vegas. Instead, don't buy the HD DVD version unless you have an HD DVD player. This product does not play on a regular DVD player. I had to return my first order and reorder the DVD version. This movie is difficult to find in the movie store, at least in my neck of the woods; so ordering it from Amazon was a logical decision. Fortunately, the customer service reps handled the issue, refunding all of my money. Don't make the same mistake I did -it takes a long time to go through the return/refund process."
1,What a lousy rendition of a classic,"I have had my copy of Fear and Loathing for over 20 years, its dog eared pages re-read umpteen times. While the book is hysterically funny, the fact is that not very much actually HAPPENS in this story, other than wandering around Las Vegas in various states of mind and paranoia. Hunter Thompson's strength is his phrasing and power of observation which the movie tries to capture with Depp's voice-over but it just doesn't work. Maybe another voice would have worked better.Unwatchable."
1,THIS MOVIE TOTALLY SUCKED. ITS ONE OF THE WORST EVER.,This movie was horrible. It was just like being around really annoying drunk people for too long. There was no point to this movie and nothing happened at all. Only for those people who do hardcore drugs. Very dissappointing.
1,Let's trash another hotel room...,"OK - so I understand that Hunter S. had these wild, drug-induced experiences and then experienced amazing moments of clarity which he was able to write about most eloquently. But other than that, so what? This film was so redundant - the overkill of the hotel trashing and partying literally made me nauseous."
1,Wow I've seen more entertaining turds in my toilet. . .,"This is, without a doubt, the worst, most disturbing movie I have ever seen. If you are goning to waist your money on this, you might as well buy some cheap liquor, get hammered, and you would get the same stupid effect, but then you wouldn't have the tempation to blow your own head off while suffering through this crap heap. If I could have, I would have given it negative 5 stars. Anybody who buys this movie deserves to be hit by a car, then pumped full of acid, shot in the knee caps, have their genitals blown off with dynamite, and then have their bloody carcasses fed to starved alligators. My recommendation: don't buy this movie (if you couldn't tell that sentiment from the rest of my review)."
1,I'm amazed this film is getting good reviews,"This had to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. For the most part, I'm a big fan of Terry Gilliam. I thought Brazil and 12 monkeys were two of the greatest films. This movie, however, is for blind diehards. It was just one visual of drug use after another. It was not funny, nor was it interesting in the least bit. I actually watched it a second time hoping to find some saving grace for the film, but sadly I could not. If you are considering buying this film, I urge you to rent it first otherwise you will be disappointed..."
2,Dont buy this crap,"The book fear and loathing in las vegas, by the brilliant Hunter S. Thompson, was a fantastic book filled with social issues like the death of the american dream. The movie, however, had all of the high points of the book taken out and was turned into a crappy stoner flick. The high point of this film, is an astonishingly good preformance by Johnny Depp as deranged sports writer Hunter Thompson, aka Raoul Duke. Buy the book not the movie."
2,This movie is funny...,"...for the first half-hour. After that, everything that Depp and Del Toro do is just dumb. You want the movie to go in some direction but it doesn't. Instead you are forced to watch Depp fall down, again, and again, and again. The short movie seems like hours, mostly because it takes the two so long to accomplish simple tasks. If you still really want to see Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas, then at least use it in small doses."
5,"""Fear and Loathing"" is a godsend","Terry Gillaim the master of film that brought you ""Brazil"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"" has done it again in this retelling of the cult classic by Hunter S. Thompson, a god of Gonzo journalism. With vivid photography and amazing special effects, the movie blows your mind with off-beat antics. Plus the cast does a superb job! FIVE STARS!!!!!"
4,Hallucinating in HD,"I was let down the first time I watched this movie, since it is sort of a cult classic, I've heard many positive words for it. Upon my second viewing though I found it to be favorable and actually really good. Hallucinations should only be viewed in your head or in HD, and everyone should know it. Plus, you can't beat the price!"
3,What a trip!,"From the man who brought us the surreal, yet hauntingly real, world of ""Brazil"" comes the drug-induced world of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas."" Terry Gilliam uses his craft to mimic this world and help the viewer feel as if he or she is part of this world. As a result, this film appears disconnected and bizarre. Don't worry. It's supposed to be that way.In route to a writing project, Johnny Depp plays Hunter S. Thompson, aka Duke Raoul, who with his lawyer, played by an initially unrecognizable Benecio Del Toro, binge and document their way through the experience. Is it the drugs or is it Las Vegas? Both seem to feed of each other.The film tells us that somehow the adages and directions given in the 60s seem to have misled us somehow. Not an anti-drug movie, the movie merely points out that there seems to be a step missing in the search for truth.I would only recommend this to a patient viewer. It does take a while to connect the ideas."
2,Pure ...,"I'll admit, my expectations were pretty high for this one. The book is an absolute classic, and one that still makes me laugh 25 years after I first read it. But this movie is a mess. Boring,pointless, and rarely funny,this film's chief claim to fame is a seemingling endless hallucinatory scene, which has Terry Gilliam written all over it. Johnny Depp gives another great performance, but nothing can save this train wreck.Too bad Alex Cox left. I think his sensibilities are better suited to the adaptation of this book. Even the Bill Murray comedy ""Where the Buffalo Roam"" is a better take on Hunter S Thompson than this movie."
3,"Monotonous, but Johnny Depp is hilarious","As I said, Johnny Depp is hilarious in here. I had a good laugh, with the way he talks and the cigarette in his mouth and the stupidities he says. But anyways, I guess the best way to enjoy this movie is by being stoned, which I was not when I saw it."
3,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,Methinks one needs to be stoned to see this all the way through!Blessings to Amazon!
3,it wasn't good enough,it was a good movie but it didn't have enough scenes where you actually see through the eyes of the tripper. rent it.
4,Re-Release Info!!!,"Hold on there, cowboy! Criterion is re-releasing this in a super souped-up special edition package! And its got a really hot cover! Wait and pick that version up instead!"
5,"Brilliant, Absurd..... More Please","""Ferris Buehler's Day Off"" for the drug set, this is the best, and most wickedly funny, movie I know about perception under the influence of psychedelic drugs. Fear & Loathing remains true to Hunter Thompson's story, for even as it celebrates the absurdity of life as seen 'with a head full of acid,' Gilliam/Depp/Del Toro's film is unafraid to reveal the most unsettling aspects of the drug journey, many of which lend the film its most indelible moments. This is one of those rare movies which is better for the living room than the cinema, because somehow you've got to keep up with the guys onscreen."
5,GET THE CRITERION EDITION,"One of the best movies made, if youve never seen it what are you waiting for??, This is a great movie and with Criterion releasing it, your sure to get the best along with a 2nd disc of features... Criterion is best when releasing the best movies."
5,EXCELLENT,This is a first class interpretation of Thompson's book. Pure Gonzo Journalism set to film. Johnny and Benicio's portrayal of Duke and Gonzo are seamless. It's a real tribute to them that they BECAME Hunter Thompson and Oscar Ocosta. There is no doubt that the chaos is real.
5,Got to like Hunter,"Hunter S Thompson one of Rolling Stone's greatest writers leads a wild & crazy life. He ""almost"" won as Aspen's Mayor back in the 80's & the platform he proposed was amazing! Funny story of Hunter & Gonzo! Try Fear & Loathing on the Campaign Trail, too!"
2,Didn't get it,I really didnt get it. But I did like the whole bat country thing. The book is soooooooooo much better and easy to get and easy to laugh.
5,One of the best movies of all time,"Sorry, I just can't get on board with anybody that thinks this is less than a masterpiece. It's expertly written, excellently directed, and features two of the best acting performances ever committed to screen.I try hard not to be cynical or close-minded, but anybody who says this is a poor film (the Amazon official reviewer included), simply doesn't understand good film. You don't have to love it, it may not be your cup of tea. But it's a cinematic triumph and one of the greatest adaptations of any novel, period."
2,Hidden Trailors,"At the end of Gilliam's biography you will find links to trailers for his films ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Brazil""."
3,Interesting at least.,"When I first saw this film I didn't care for it. I felt it had some funny stuff in the first half of the film and that was about it. But I have slowly come to appreciate this film (at least parts of it). Being 16 this was really my first view at a culture I had never seen before: the acid culture of the 1970s. I feel it looks like it would have been an interesting time to be alive (although I'm glad I wasn't). This film seemed to portray it fairly well. I liked Johnny Depp's acting especially his monologue on the ""high and beautiful wave"" they were riding in this time.By no means at great film though. Directing was only moderate and some of the film is quite repulsive. An interesting film but could be better. Diserves a 3.5 but not available."
3,"Great book, iffy movie","Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas was a book that should have never been made into a movie. The greatness of Hunter Thompson's writings are his play with language, his detached yet vividly hilarious descriptions of the mayhem in his wake, and the complete over-the-top loopiness and dangerous philosophizing of his literary alter ego. In his books, the writing is the thing. In this movie, the mumbling, the drugs, the vomiting, and the '60s is [sic] the thing. But I repeat myself. What is funny on paper is not necessarily funny onscreen; while you have the distinct feeling that Thompson on paper is spinning a yarn full of hyperbole and grand guignol, onscreen you're face-to-face with a love letter to '60s psychedelic over-indulgence. And I was not surprised to see Alex Cox as one of the writers. It was well-made, and Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro were great, but it should never have been made into a movie."
4,Insanity at it's best,"After watching this film I didn't know what to think.This movie is a truly wicked angle in the lives of two drug users in Las Vegas. At first they are supposed to cover the motorcycle event that is taking place there. After that takes place, the movie goes straight to hell.This is simply a view of what these guys do when they're under the influence of drugs. And it can be knee-slapping funny, whether the humor is intentional or not. Even without a coherent plot, the movie keeps the viewer interested in what the main characters will do next.Johnny Depp is excellent, especially his narration. And if you want to see a very well-off Benicio Del Toro, he's all here."
5,Great Movie...,"What else can I say but awsome. Hunter S Thompson never dissapoints. Love the book, love the movie. Have purchased many of his books and have enjoyed them all."
4,"Flippin' lizards, man!","Did the Amazon.com reviewer watch the same movie I did? I have to say that Mr. Shannon is completely wrong in his assessment of this film. This is as close an adaptation of the book that you could get and it's pretty darn near perfect. Johnny Depp is thoroughly convincing as Raoul Duke and Benicio Del Toro is just plain gonzo as the all-consuming lawyer sidekick. Their desert hijinks served as nothing more than brain candy and a cult rite of passage for college kids everywhere. Gilliam does an admirable job at interpreting and visually representing what can only exist in the imagination of the warped and depraved. For that he should be praised.A definite must see for all Gilliam, Depp and HST fans out there. Don't let Amazon.com dissuade from a truly uniqie cinematic experience."
5,Absolutely brilliant translation of the book,"I didn't expect too much when I saw this film, convinced that there was just no way that the insane headlong rush of the book could or would be properly rendered on-screen, but I was wrong - this is a truly accurate and amazing adaptation of the book. If you hate the movie then you hate the book - sure the movie makes no sense, but nor does the book and why does it have to? I enjoyed the madness of the book for its own sake and the same applies to the film. The weird, swooping, rapidly changing camera angles are extremely well done accurately capturing the descriptions in Hunter S's book. The hotel decor in which the good doctor found himself enmeshed was truly scary. Well done to those that made this incredible movie possible, you have once again proven how brilliant you really are."
4,"Psychedelic and drug crazed, very true.","While not filmed for the conservative members of our culture, the movie, touches a humor that only those who have experienced the madness of a ""drug bindge"" could understand. The movie does not ""promote drugs"" as many would like to say, what it does is show them from a different perspective. Glamourized or not, this is one of the coolest films I've ever seen."
4,Remember the early 70s,I cant think of a better way to recall the 70s. Be careful about children watching. Lots of drug use fun.
5,"I went on a voyage far, far away...","I must be 2/3 predictable, because out of the three movies recommended for people who bought ""Fear and Loathing,"" I love two (""Big Lebowski"" and ""Brazil""). But I must also have a shard of reckless unpredictability as well because I hated the third, ""Crash."" In any case, I'm a big Gilliam fan, but not a blind one. ""12 Monkeys"" was lacking in depth and a few other things, but ""Fear and Loathing"" makes up for it in more ways than one. Dissuaded from seeing the film in the theater because of all the bad press, I ended up renting it one night not expecting to think much of it. What happened was, the film just blew me the hell away. I've almost never been taken so far away from my real physical timespace. I journeyed through a spiral of mental states I didn't even know were possible during complete sobriety. I also laughed deeply and painfully.Hats of to Gilliam for this one, it's just amazing."
2,Frustrating,"This movie had so much potential I can hardly stand it. After the first ten minutes, I thought I was in for a hilarious 'trip' the whole way through. Unfortunately, the amusing reactions to the various drugs and the equally amusing narrations by the Duke himself, were replaced with disgusting, drawn out scenes of vomiting and attempted suicide. This is something that needed to be there in some form because of the nature of the film, but it could have been shortened considerably or just simply alluded to and replaced with comedy or plot development. At least I didn't hate it completely like everyone else I know."
3,Don't do drugs ... just watch this movie for the approximate experience,"Interesting to see Johnny Depp in a bizarro movie before Pirates of the Caribbean and a near reprisal (with hair) in The Rum Diary, but it would have been much more believable if he didn't have that cigarette holder in his mouth the entire movie (albeit an ironic critique, given the movie's overall plot/content). But any movie about Vegas, having been to Vegas so many times, makes one nostalgic regardless."
1,loathsome,"glorifying and humorizing drug addiction is just not very smart. This movie will appeal to hopheads I suppose. Johnny Depp does an embarassing mumbling bland performance trying to look confused and competent at the same time......spend your hard-earned money elsewhere, no value for dollar here"
1,Suckiest Movie Award goes to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. It is filled with gibberish and incoherant nonsense. The plot is as nonexistant as the dialogue. It's too bad Jonny Depp got dooped into doing this movie. It's a waste of the casette it is recorded on. That was two hours I will never get back. If I could, I would have given it a 0 star rating."
2,Long and Boring,"Long on loathing. Boring, I fear. This trip was at somewhere I've never been, and I don't want to go there. A place beyond the event horizon. Who could care less about these people? Great title for a book, or a film, though. For some reason I've given it an extra star. I don't know why. Perhaps because it definitely belongs in anybody's collection of bizarre movies."
1,What a long bad trip it is,"Hunter S. Thompson was a major figure in the 70's. His original publications in Rolling Stone helped draw together a counter culture. This film, however, is nothing. Zilch. Zero.If a 0 was a choice, then this movie deserves a 0. There is no redeeming value. Social or otherwise.The man whose life became immortalized in Doonesbury, here turns into a cartoon character drawn by a drunken idiot. Perhaps that was Hunter's life. But as a movie it is unwatchable.Save your money. Chug a bottle of booze. And sit with your head in a toilet. You'll be more highly entertained than watching one moment of this film."
1,What Is Happening Here?,"Does anyone understand this? I watched with my cat and my cat fell asleep. I think the movie is a tricky joke by the bald man with the half-hair on his face sides (is he the teenager police from Telemundo Jump Show?) No movie would have a toaster in the bath. Why does the half-hair face man talk out of the side of his mouth? Why do they like riding horses that are not real? This movie has silly hair and sneaky talkings; I would say not to watch with any animals, especially sleepy cat."
2,Waste of 2 hours,"I have enjoyed all HST works, the books are great. This film bored the ass off me. Drugs dont offend me but a repetetive film does. I wish I hadn't wasted my money."
1,"If I wanted to see druggies, I'd hang out in downtown Flint!","Did you understand the plot? Neither did I. This was a very realistic film, unfortunately, reality is often confused and boring. The camera angle never stayed in one place, making the confusion even more elaborate. Nothing was explainable, everything happened too fast. Just because a movie is true to real life, doesn't mean it's any good."
1,huge disappointment,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film.With all the talent behind it,how could you not?I'm a big fan of anything different and original,but I have this weird,crazy problem with things that are insanely boring!The performances are top notch and the drug trips are somewhat entertaining,but even that wears off after about 30 minutes.After an hour I was just begging it to be over(like a bad acid trip)!But,nope...more scenes of knife wielding and drug hallucinations.This movie may be great if you're still living in the sixties or if drugs are the absolute center of your life,but I'll take a good story over a hit of ether any day!"
1,This movies,"This is easily on the top ten list of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Nothing memorable and worth mentioning. Shabbily put together and very uninteresting. If you you thought ""Cry Baby"" was bad, If you thought ""The Man that New to Little"" was bad, if you thought ""where the buffalo roam"" was bad you aint seen nothing yet....."
2,"Great movie, horrible blu ray.","I enjoy this movie, and decided to get the blu ray instead of the criterion edition. This was a horrible mistake. The blu ray has no special features, not even a commentary(the criterion has 3). I will be purchasing the criterion edition sometime in the future."
2,boring,I tired quickly of stumbling intoxicated drugged stupidity. I had hoped see more of the gifted writer and hiscreativity rather than his drug induced stupor. Alas it was all stupor.
2,Bizarre But Boring,"I have tried to watch this movie several times but, I just lose interest every time and turn it off. The main character, Raoul, as played by Johnny Depp comes off as an annoying little twerp. The story seems to go nowhere. The scene where Raoul is checking in to the Vegas hotel while tripping is well done. The creatures moving in the carpet is a good representation of acid visual distortion. I liked Where the Buffalo Roam more."
4,read between the lines,"I read so many reviews of this movie where people just don't get it, and try to keep others from doing so. What people don't do is read between the lines, and pick up all of the great 1971 Vietnam-era social commentary. This is not just a druggie movie. Watch it again."
2,"Great movie, bad sound","I am a huge fan of this movie. I've seen it dozens of times, and was so excited when it was released on blu-ray. In terms of the quality of the movie, it's a terrific movie with great performances. I highly recommend it. The only problem I had with this blu-ray is that there are numerous sound effects missing from the audio track. Maybe I had it on a wrong setting or the blu ray i purchased is the only one having this problem, but if the blu-ray is in fact missing audio elements from the original cut, I find it very disappointing. I'm not sure if Criterion Collection plan on re-releasing a blu-ray version of this movie, but If they do, hopefully all the audio will will be included in tact. Bottom line: I'm fairly irritated I spent the money on an incomplete transfer."
5,Pure Gonzo journalism.........,"""We where somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold""Fear & Lothing in Las Vegas is the movie that pop's up in my mind when asked ""what's your favourite movie"", i have seen it about eight times now and it keeps getting better.Yes, it is f***** up, but that's what makes it so intersting and fun.Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro portray their roles brilliantly as Raoul Duke & DR. Gonso, two drug abusing friends looking for the american dream.Well if you liked the book (wich is brilliant) then i can't imagine you not likeing this.And the criterion collection speaks for itself....so buy this movie and love it.""Just another freak, in the freak kingdom"""
4,Great movie,"This is a really good movie, Johnny Depp at his best. This is definitely not for everyone, if you find drugs or drug culture offensive, this is not for you."
5,Amazon review way offbase!,I must say that Jeff Shannons review is his opinion but i couldnt disagree more. This is one of the funniest surreal and worthy adaptions of a book that seemed unfilmable. Gilliam Depp and Del toro along with an excellent cast of recoginizable faces make this an essential cult classic comedy. The images- camera angles- sets -visual effects- and fantastic chemistry between Depp and Del toro along with kitchsy soundtrack music are perfectly matched. I even go as far to judge my opinions on people i know as to whether they like this movie or not. Either you get it or you dont. Its that simple. You dont need to stoned or drunk to enjoy this film though it doesnt hurt. Johnny depp gives the peformance of a lifetime and i cant emphasize the small roles played by many well known actors- pretty much everyone does their part well. The dialogue is great and repeated viewings give something new each time. One of my favorite films and a must see if there ever was one.
5,This is my all time favorite movie,"There is no film I can relate to more than this one.......Johnny Depp is a genius in his portrayal,......as is Hunter S. Thompson, in general, of course. 'When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.'"
3,Faithful adaptation of a hilarious book,"This film is incredibly true to the book on which it's based. The strange thing is that what happens in the book isn't necessarily funny but Thompson's DESCRIPTION of it is absolutely hilarious. To actually see the things Thompson describes being portrayed in the film is not nearly as funny as imagining it from his brilliantly-written descriptions. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro are incredible here and Gilliam is courageously faithful to his source, but they can't really make the film funny for me. Watching this admirable but somewhat depressing film made me all the more appreciative of Thompson's genius with words."
5,You either love it or hate it,"This is my favourite movie (well tied with Holy Grail). But I know from my friend's experiences you either love it or hate it. Most of them loved it, for a couple they just don't see the point. I find it funny. I love the character Depp did, but some pople don't. If you like quirky things, I would suggest it. Otherwise, maybe something else would be better. On my todo list is to read the book next"
4,A Hellish Reality,"Terry Gilliam produces yet another derranged film that totally amazed me. Based on Hunter Thomas' novel, I wonder how many of his fans feel about this new adaptation. I've read the novel, and truthfully I see no real changes in the film. A few here and there perhaps, but nothing big. Johnny Depp does an admirable job portraying the eccentric Thompson. An all round great movie, at times throughout the film I actually felt as though I had taken a hit off of acid. Again, if you are a huge Thompson fan your critique will probably be a little more deeper than my own. Honestly beyond his book and this movie I don't know a lot about him. I know at one part he rode with the Hell's Angels, which took balls. If they were to make a movie about that, you'd have an Oscar nomination to expect."
1,It was terrible.,"I'm sorry if I'm upsetting people by saying this but this movie was terrible. Besides the fact it had no plot, no direction, and didn't explain the whole monster outfit thing it just didn't make any sense. Although I'm sure that was the point the director should have had at least a little more consideration to his audience with alot of things. So for all those reasons I say this movie SUCKED."
1,Fear and Loathing was what I felt for the director,"Not since my 1996 Root Canal have I had to endure such pain as sitting through this film. What a disjointed, unfulfilling piece of crap, and to know on my death bed 40 years from now, I could have spent those 2 hours doing anything else, will haunt me. Flushing the three dollars, and watching it swirl down the toilet would have been more entertaining."
1,One of the worst f**king movies ever made,"Damn! When I went into this, I figured ""Okay, Terry Gilliam, great director, Johnny Depp, good actor, should be funny and at least all right. .... It is funny in the beginning, especcially Depp's drugged-out warning ""We can't stop here, this is bat country!"", but after about 20 minutes or so you realize that it's just one drawn-out drug trip and the only question on your mind (well, my mind anyway) is ""When will it end?"" To Depp's credit, he does do a good acting job under the circumstances (I hardly even recognized him with his bald head), but the story was just bad and Terry Gilliam has a tendency to keep his films going long after they should have ended (in the case of this one, it should have stopped when he got the script). All in all this was a most disappointing movie experience; if it came out a couple years after the novel did, it probably would have done well, but not in today's world. Sorry."
1,If you only miss one movie this year make it this one!,"I love movies and I'm willing to accept films that are out there but this movie wasn't just out there it was just stupid. Everything had been done before. The way they treated drugs and the effects of them was at least a little on the mark but it never captivated even a little bit of my attention. I was so sad that I had paid money to watch it. I finally got fed up with it and turned off the tape 3/4 of the way threw the film. Therefore it may have some quailites in the ending that I'm not aware of but I think that the rest of the film is so terrible that it couldn't possibally be worth it. If you like J.Depp, as I do, then you would be much better off renting one of his other movies. If you are interested in the effects of drug abuse you could do much better by viewing almost any other movie with the same subect matter."
1,Love or Hate?,"If you notice the above reviews, everyone seems to have very definite opinions about this movie. They either love it or hate it. I'm a diehard Terry Gilliam fan, I'd go see him flush a toilet, then ask for my money back. Well, that's how I felt about this movie. I waited a long time before I was able to see it and expected great things from Gilliam, Depp and Del Toro and got nothing but disappointment. I'd be curious to hear (or read) Hunter S. Thompson's take on the finished version of this movie. My impressions of Mr. Thompson are very different from the portrayal by Johnny Depp. And there are too many reasons to list here. My advice: If you really like Terry Gilliam's movies, you probably have to see this film anyway--just don't come looking for me when you want your money back."
1,Death of HD DVD,Never got to watch because bluray became the stamdard. Wish i would have never made this purchase. Should have bought in bluray format
3,Weird,"I've never seen a movie like this.Depp is superb,but what a waste of talent and money doing this stupid film.Nothing makes sense."
3,This Ain't No Chick Flick,"I bought this DVD for the commentaries. I still don't know if I should have! But I love Terry Gilliam.When I first saw this movie, I felt like I was left out of the joke. Now I get the joke, at least. But I also feel, unlike before, there is poignancy to this plot. These guys are making themselves sick--they're using drugs to alter their perceptions, 24-7. Reality being so unappealing. So empty. So uncool. And what about the folks they meet on their journey? They're shadows, jokes, or victims. (The victims are women.)It's a funny movie, but should I laugh? Maybe I will eventually.Why did I buy this? I thought it would be easier to take, all these years later. It is, but.... Oh well! May as well watch it again! It is, after all beautifully filmed. The sets and the lighting are just extraordinary. Commentaries are cool, too, but I wish Depp and Del Toro had recorded theirs together. Their interaction would have been a scream!"
3,A valiant failure,"Despite their fans' best efforts, some books just aren't filmable. David Cronenberg's Classics Comics version of Naked Lunch came to mind while watching Fear and Loathing, since both books depend on language and rhetoric rather than plot or characterization for their effect. Gilliam's heavy dependence on Depp's character (Thompson? Duke? Gonzo?)'s voice over of significant chunks of the book merely shows that what made Thompson's work so fun to read was how he said it. Ralph Bakshi's idea of making an animated version based on Ralph Steadman's illustrations sounds like it would have captured the tone of the book much better than this movie."
2,"Not The Worst, Not The Best","I thought I would love this movie but I didn't. After two hours of watching two druggies on vacation in Las Vegas, I felt as if I was the only sober person at a party. It is a movie best viewed when stoned."
2,Not for everybody,"I was disappointed with this movie. I knew about the heavy amount of drug scenes before I saw this movie, and enjoy Johnny Depp movies, but this movie was a little too far out for me.JTB"
1,Worst movie of the year!,"Director cowriter Terry Gilliams adaptation of Hunter S Thompsons infamous pseudobiographical epic of gonzo-journalistic social commentary is a veritable mess from start to finish: an absolutely unwatchable jumble of surrealistic images and uncontrolled self-indulgent perfor mances by leads Johnny Depp fitfully funny as Thompson surrogate Raoul Duke and Beicio Del Toro utterly loathsome as bestial Dr Gonzo.This intellectually bankrupt project does little beyond wallowing,as its characters do, in substance-abused excess."
1,"Great HD DVD, but this movie was a waste of time!","Great HD DVD, but this movie was a waste of time! Sorry, just don't care for it."
1,Terrible!,"When I received the video, it did not play. We returned the item and received a new one promptly. The second video was also no good. It did not play. We returned the item again. Eventually we received a full refund for the entire order but I was disappointed that the DVD did not play on two different occasions. The customer service regarding the returns was wonderful."
5,Great movie,It is a mix of great acting and a comedic look at drug use. Don't stop here this is bat country.
5,"""Get In"". ""We're your friends""","Immortal lines from an exceptional look inside the mind of a man best left to his own devices. This film is an excellent adaptation, proving Gilliam to be not only a top director but a somewhat perverse one, staying true to the book for as much as can be allowed. However, the whole film is somewhat uncomfortable to watch, and is not for the faint hearted. Having said that, the discomfort is due to the extremes the characters endure and decidedly not due to any problems with production etc. This film shows that Gilliam is perhaps one of the bravest directors of our time, and should not go unregarded. My only dissappointment was the withdrawal of the scene where Raoul Duke and Dr Gonzo terrorise a naive police chief at a bar with tales of addicts. Otherwise, this film is true to the book and hence very, very deranged."
4,It takes a special kind of brain....,"Most people won't like this movie. It is weird, at times shocking and offensive, and most definitely not for the general public. But I found it terribly funny, full of terrific catch-phrases, and more entertaining that most of the movies I've seen this year. Depp is incredible, particularly with his dead-on characterization of Hunter Thompson."
5,Excellent. Follows the book fairly well.,"The book that could not be made into a movie is what Thompson's 1971 journey into the savage heart of the American dream was called. But, thanks to one excellent director and some superior acting, it happened. Gilliam's F&LLV was great; so great in fact that I watched 3 times back to back. Everyone should see this movie. Whether or not you like drugs, whether or not you like gonzo filmmaking, you should see this movie. If you saw it and didn't like it, you need to see it with what Bill Hicks called your ""third eye."""
5,fun movie,"if you have never seen this then it might not be for you. its a movie all about letting go and taking lots of drugs. if you think drugs are funny like i do, then you will love it. plus depp is great. enjoy."
1,The most asinine movie I've ever attempted to watch.,"I'm on a bad roll here. Last week I rented Dumb and Dumberer which would have kept the above title had I not gotten hold of this ""gem"". It was so bad I didn't waste the final 25 minutes it would have taken to finish the disk. Really bad acitng by the two main stars and the voices were not even in sync. Johhny Depp doing Jeff ""Jurasic Park"" Goldblum totally stoned for two hours has to be the most aggrevating film experience I can recall. Pointless would recap it in one word. Enough time wasted on this project. There isn't any way to rate here without at least one star- I'd certainly not even give it one."
1,"Total bore, Criterion movies suck","Awful, horribly stupid movie. One of THE most overrated movies ever made, right behind the Boondock Saints. I cant believe I finished them both. Ugh."
1,Wow! I thought there were bad movies...,"... but this one just hits the bottom!After reading about it: the cast, Gilliam, etc. I thought that it should be a good movie, but oh, what a disappointment...Drug use and abuse is no good, that's what the movie keeps shouting all the time.Images are weird (druggy), acting is weird (druggy), plot is weird (druggy), etc.I have no doubts lots of people will like it (as some reviewers adore it), but not me.I love strange movies (""Mulholland Dr."", ""Memento"", ""The Wall"", ""Pi"", ""Delicatessen"", etc), but this one was just over the top.You really need to be in the mood to watch it.It's not your popcorn-kind of movie."
1,2 Hours of Nothing that Leads toward Nothing,I heard many people rave about this movie and then I watched it for myself and nothing ever happened really in the movie to me. It just seemed like 2 hours that lead nowhere. I'll watch anything once all the way through. Will never watch this bad movie again though.
2,Drug Voyeurs,"This movie is for all those sad people who want to do drugs but don't (and there are a great many of them). Watching these two guys get stoned in Las Vegas is similar to watching two people making love, very deeply unsatisfying. It's one of those things that you've got to do yourself. No amount of watching helps. I watched it because of Terry Gilliam, but he wasn't able to find any artistic tension in the ""anything goes"" atmosphere of a drug binge in Vegas."
1,Disappointed,"Rhis particulat version is not able to be played in a US DVD player. Probably partly my fault, but it was not super clear that it was a foreign version."
1,Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas,The HD/DVD would not play in the DVD player. Will return DVD to Amazon for an exchange for a non-HD/DVD of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.
1,god awful,"Hunter Thompson's brillance is lost in this terrible adapation. Problem is that the book is largely composed of internal dialogue which is too difficult to turn into cinema.Nice try, but no thanks!"
2,you call this funny?,"An insult to intelligence and not even funny...boring and at the same time, disturbing...it's a shame Johnny Depp took this role?? Or not??"
4,Fans of the book rejoice; others beware.,"If you loved Hunter S. Thompson's gonzo semi-autobiographical novel, as I did, then you're likely to enjoy this wildly energetic, acid-drenched romp through the American counterculture. Johnny Depp turns in an amazing performance as Raoul Duke (aka Hunter Thompson). He can make you laugh just be tilting his head a certain way. However, if you haven't read the book, you're very likely to hate this film. All of the dialogue is directly quoted from the book, but it's often spoken in an unintelligable fasion. Bottom line: read the book first."
5,Amazing Film. Amazing Book. Amazing Director.,"Terry Gilliam is the best director alive now that poor Stan Kubrick is no longer with us. If it is the last thing you do go and buy Brazil and 12 Monkeys. After buying this, of course. Of course the viewer from the ""small suburban home"" didn't like it! He's one of THEM! This movie was hypnotic and wonderful. And I wasn't even on any illegal narcotics. But read the book first. In fact, go to books, buy the book, and then come back. And get ""The Great Shark Hunt"" too."
1,This movie was garbage. What's the point?,"OK, the acting was excellent. And the carpet acid trip effect was cool, BUT the sundry drug trips these dudes were perpetually on wore thin after about 15 minutes. As did their 'tune in, tune out' message. Proceeding to watch the whole senseless film was like chinese water torture. There is a reason Maltin rated this lousy film 'A BOMB'!"
1,One of the WORST movies of the 90s or ever,"This has to be the 3rd worst movie of the 90s since ""Armageddon and Titanic"". This movie is plotless and pointless with Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro on drugs and visiting Las Vegas for no reason at all and have hallucinations. The movie soon turns into one unwatchable mess with odd camera angles and some pathetic scenes that make no sense at all. A bunch of well-known stars Tobey Maguire,Cameron Diaz,Penn Jillette,Flea,Ellen Barkin,Christina Ricci,Mark harmon,and Harry Dean Stanton appear in wasted cameos and the two role leads(Depp and del Toro) are wasted and give some of the worst performances of their careers. The movie's author Hunter S.Thompson appears in a cameo. This one dosen't deserve one star or a Criterion Collection DVD. Please don't waste money or time on this mess because this isn't even a so good,its bad movie."
2,Goofy look at 1971,Any old hippie from 1971 will wonder why they wasted their money on this unusual and weird flick. Although the pace is mind boggling and Depp is a great actor the voice overs are distracting and absurd. The bad acid trip sequences belong in another movie. Maybe the other movie will be better than this one. (The DVD copy I purchased had one damaged track but didn't affect this review).
4,HOLY GEABUS WHAT ARE THESE GOD DAMN ANIMALS!!!!!!!,"this is a hilarious movie. even though i know its not suppose to be funny. it is also a weird movie. johnny depp has been known to star in depressed and deep characters but in this movies hes just just plain hilarious. he talks funny in this movie too. the other thing with this movie is basically every movie has a love story, and this movie doesnt really. but its still a great movie you could laugh your ass off with your friends. this is the ultimate chill out movie. if you you like those kind of movies watch this. this is one of depps best movies. and one of the best drug movies of all time!!!!!!!!!"
2,Johnny Depps's worst.,"When I heard about this film I thought I was in for a treat but I guess I was wrong. Basically about some drug addicts who explore las vegas with every drug you can think of and spend lots of cash during the 70's. Where is the storyline? There was no plot and you probably need to be wired in order to understand the movie. Never was a big fan of Depp anyway, but I do have to recommend Blow and Sleep Hollow."
4,FALILV,I was very happy with the movie quality. But some of the sound quality could be revised.in some scenes the audio quality gets louder than lifter in the same scene. Overall it is still great to own on blu Ray.
5,Awesome movie!,"If you haven't seen this movie I don't know where you've been. It's based on the novel written by Hunter S. Thompson, who is one of the most fascinating people of this century. Buy this today."
5,Must Watch,"Fear and Loathing is An AWESOME movie. If you've never seen it then you should watch it ASAP! Iv seen this movie about five years ago, and have not been able to find it in any stores(except amazon of course). And since watching it five years ago,iv been craving to watch it again.Its that good! If Your thinking about buying this movie, DO IT.....WATCH IT!"
3,good but still waiting,i got one movie and it was perfect still waiting on the other one to arrive i thought they were shipped together but other wise good deal
5,Great American Novel Turned Film,Simply Put The Actors Do A great job of Bringing the characters to the screen amazing script based mainly on the book except for literally a few words.Shortened From the book But a Good Payoff Nonetheless.Not To Menstion Funny as Hell...My Point You Should See The Film If you Haven't.
5,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"Adapted from Thompson's legendary book by ""Brazil"" director (and former Monty Python-er) Terry Gilliam, ""Vegas"" is a hilariously degenerate look at counterculture excess. Depp, who spent months hanging with Hunter, flawlessly channels the odd mannerisms and mumbling, cigarette-munching diction of his wacked-out subject. Del Toro is a hoot, too, especially when he gets into trouble with an underage nymph (the seductive, saucer-faced Christina Ricci). Cameos by Penn Jillette, Gary Busey, Cameron Diaz, and many others make Gilliam's surreal romp an even zanier amusement. Though not for all tastes, for a dizzying trip to outer weirdness, hit the road with ""Vegas."""
5,"""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas""","Fear and loathing may be the greatest movie i have ever seen, the first time i seen it i thought it was stupid as i did not understand it. Its the type of movie you must pay real good attention to if you wish to understand it. The 2nd time i watched it i was alone and paid attention to it and i absoulutly loved it. i have watched it 4 or 5 times since then. This movie is not for everyone though, its hard to understand, if you don't catch the beggining don't bother watching the rest cuz you won't get it at all, it will be a meaningless drug movie. The drugs are an integral part to this movie and it is part of the reason i love this movie so much so check it out."
5,Gilliam is a genius,"This film definitely confirmed my view that Terry Gilliam is one of the best film directors of today. Before I saw it, I thought nobdoy could successfully transmit Hunter S. Thompson's classic, ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" to the screen - but Gilliam proved me wrong. It was almost like stepping into the pages of the book. Gilliam totally captured the feel and intensity of Thompson's drug-induced view of Las Vegas and his biting commentary on American culture. ""Fear and Loathing"" is thus simultaneously satire, social criticism and psychedelic mayhem. Johnny Depp as Thompson is also fantastic, as he plays the role with a driven, paranoid brilliance. I can't praise this film enough, it's an instant classic."
5,Another great movie by Terry Gilliam!,"Terry Gilliam has to be my favorite director of all time (Plus he did those crazy animations in Monty Python's Flying Circus! Weeeeeeeee! ) and THIS has to be my favorite movie of all time! I read the book and loved it, then I found out that they were making a movie directed byyyyyyyy: TERRY GILLIAM! It takes the exact words from the book and hardly changes a thing! Everytime I watch a movie based on a book, its always a disappointment. But this time, it wasn't! The movie's visuals were great! Great acting by Johnny D. and the rest of the cast! It even has a short semi-hidden appearance of Hunter S. Thompson the writter of the book! This movie was crazy! 5 stars all the way!"
1,Featuring Jimmy Page??????,Jimmy Page is a guitar god and legend. Peter Puff Daddy is a freaking joke! Featuring Jimmy Page...Please give me a break! This is a disaster and should be skipped at all cost. If I could give negative stars I would have.
3,Not too bad.,"I enjoy all music types. People get so hyped up that a song is reproduced. I give Puffy some credit. Half the guys who complain can't even spell the name of the lead singer of Led Zepplin. Easy boys, like it?--great. Don't like it fine, but don't trash it for the other listeners out there."
1,Wow Can this rapper make up his freakin mind!?!?!?!?!,"I mean he took a great song with nice rythem etc. And truned it into a joke. This is the worst song i have ever heard. The only good thing on the song is JIMMY PAGE, but puffy takes all the credit. This Rapper needs to make up his mine is he a rapper or a rocker?!?!?!?!!?"
1,Blasphemy,This song is a disgrace to both hip hop and rock. Kashmir is one the the greatest rock songs ever and Puffy turned it into a joke. This track completely shows Puffy's lack of any lyrical skills and is proof that he needs to stop making a mockery of what I love (hip hop)!!!
1,Terrible,"This song sucks! Puff Daddy has absolutley no creative bone in his body. He is going to drag Led Zepplin down just like he did with the Police in ""Every Breath you Take."" I would rather tear off an appendage than listen to this crap one more time. He should stick with pig farming or something based on some rational basis"
5,PUFF'S GOT THE STUFF,Puff Daddy is awesome. It is so great that two awesome musicians can come together and produce such an awesome song.
1,Doesn't even deserve one.,"Jimmy Page is God. This rapper has no talent. Led Zeppelin is an amazing band, the best band of all time and this dumbass rapper ruins one of their songs....shame what's our world coming to?"
1,"I'd give it less, but it only goes to one.","All I can say is, write your own d*** songs. Kashmir is one of the greatest songs of all time, and this just makes a mockery of it. I can't believe that Jimmy Page would actually consent to doing this. This terrible. No two ways about it. It takes a great song, and turns it into garbage. Now people think Led Zeppelin stole it from Puff Daddy! Puff Daddy is giving Led Zeppelin a bad name. MAKE IT STOP!!! NO MORE!!! PLEASE!!!"
2,PUFF DADDY SUX !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THE ONLY REASON YOU SHOULD BY THIS CD IS BECAUSE OF JIMMY PAGE.
5,Great new side of Puffy,"I think that Puff Dad and Jimmy Page did a great job on this song. It's good to see a new and ""interesting"" side of Puffy. even though I think he should stick to rap, this rock compilation is awesome"
1,Why,"To begin with, Led Zeppelin is one of the greatest bands ever. This song however is horrible. Puff Daddy didn't change anything on the song except the lyrics, and he did a horrible job lyrically. This just shows how Puff Daddy is the epitome of pop. To be honest, this song makes me sick. If your gonna do you hip-pop thing Puffy, stick to it, but please don't butcher classics such as this song. I am completely surprised that Jimmy Page agreed to this crap. Stay away from this."
1,Horrible. Awful. There just aren't words.,"I love Led Zeppelin, but I never liked this song to begin with. However, it's even worse that Puffy or P. Diddy or Diddy or whatever the heck he is calling himself this week took it and butchered it beyond all logical reasoning. This is a perfect example of how bad of rapper VD or wahtever his name is, really is. Completely uncreative and unoriginal. Hello people, any of you who think this is creative or groundbreaking don't get out much. Any of us can take a song, remove the lyrics, and rap over it. And any of us could probably make something better than this piece of crap by doing so. Diddy, stick to producing and STAY AWAY from classic rock songs. For the love of God. Now, I have to go throw up."
3,Disapointing,"The ""skills"" are stiff and difficult to use, and I must hold them down for him due to the puzzle function. Considering attaching some velcro to secure the pieces, but still, had much higher hopes for this."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this for my grandson. From the pictures it looked like a great learning toy. Since it is a puzzle each piece comes loose so it is near impossible to try and button, zip, etc. even if they did work. The zipper wouldn't zip, the seat belt latch would not release, in fact the only thing that worked like you expected was the snap. Major disappointment for a Melissa and Doug toy."
3,hard for small hands,"I usually love Melissa & Doug toys, but I was dissapointed with this one. The button hole is stitched so tightly that it's hard for toddler-sized hands to put the huge button through it. The belt is also a bit tricky since the holes are close together.The plus side: it's a basical skills board and puzzle all-in-one, and it's fun to ""dress""/""undress"" the bear."
4,Good to keep little hands busy,This is fun for kids to learn new skills. It will keep their hands busy.
2,Poor design,"I bought this toy to help my son learn to tie his shoes. It is very difficult to perform the individual tasks (botton, zipper, etc) because it is a puzzle and the pieces obviously come out. Even if you take each pieces out and try to perform the task, it is impossible to keep the pieces stationary/still while trying to tie or button (as the task itself requires two hands). My child is a very independantand wanted to be able to it himself. However, it is impossable as it takes a 2nd person to hold the pieces steady so he can practice tying, buttoning, etc. That being said, all three of my children enjoy the puzzle aspect of this toy."
3,Great activities,"Great activities to keep my 2.5 year old busy, although some are a little difficult for her. My only complaint is that the skills pieces are also puzzle pieces and very hard to work on when they come out and aren't stationary, but I just glued all the pieces down and that makes it much more fun to work on."
5,Basics skills board,Excellent quality. We were so impressed with it we just ordered another one for our daughters family. Melissa and Doug products are great.
1,Poor Quality,"I got this puzzle because I love every other Melissa and Doug puzzle we have ever had and I thought it would be great for my son to practice using some of these skills. I was SO disappointed with the quality of the parts. The wood and puzzle part is fine, but the parts like the zipper are just cheap. I have a hard time getting it to zip - there is no way my preschooler could do it. Also the plastic clip is really hard and the button hole is not big enough to get the button through easily. On top of all the parts being hard the idea of having all of these things on a puzzle piece so it is not fixed down on a surface makes it even harder to do. Don't waste your money - you can find fabric books that have these skills on etsy.com or at craft shows that are so much better."
3,"Great concept, hard to use","We got this toy to help with the essential dressing items. The concept is great but some of the parts are hard to use. Even for me, the zipper gets stuck regularly and the button is almost impossible to do. The other ones work great but those ones are the most important in my book. Our son plays with it but not nearly as much as other zipper/button toys."
3,"It's ok, but could be better","The zipper & the belt buckle aren't easy enough for my two year old, it takes my careful muscle to do it. But I guess then she might still be interested in it when she's five."
5,This is an awesome puzzle,My daughter would take individual pieces with her in the car and play quietly for quite awhile. We have since lost a couple of the pieces and I'm tempted to buy another one except she can do all the stuff now. I think this is rated for kids 3+ but we gave this to her at about 12 months old.
1,"Well, darn.","Mother of six and I love Melissa and Doug... This item however is terrible. My child can do 24 piece puzzles almost alone but still not the fixtures on the puzzle pieces! No slack, bad geometry, they tried but not a go."
2,"Difficult, poor craftmanship","Let me preface by saying that I usually LOVE Melissa and Doug products, and that they are usually well-made and nicely constructed. However, this one misses the boat, because some of the items are simply using cheap materials that are difficult to fasten and unfasten. Quality fasteners would have solved this. (snap, buckle, and belt are the specific items that are difficult for a little one to do -- even I have a hard time with the dog-collar styled buckle.)"
3,difficult on little hands,"this is a cute concept, but for the fact that the pieces come off the board makes it very hard for the little ones, since they need one hand to hold the piece down and one hand to try and figure it out..."
3,"Great idea, difficult to use",Love the idea of this product because my 2 year old loves buckles and zips but they are very difficult to use for a toddler. I could barely unbuckle it!
2,CJO's Mom,"I'm very disappointed in this product. The pieces were actually difficult for me or my husband to handle, let alone our toddler - who by the way is a master at zippers and latches. I'm a big fan of other M&D products, but wish we hadn't wasted our money on this one. Thankful for one other reviewer's idea of gluing the pieces to the board in hopes that will make it at least a bit easier to work with."
5,Perfect for learning each task individualy & not getting distracted,"Everyone said they didn't like this because it is a puzzle and the pieces come out when the little ones try to complete each task, I think they are using this Backwards!What I believe the point is to take each of the pieces of clothes off the bear 1st, then have the child shut each item (button, buckle, snap, zip, etc.) and then once the task is completed you put each one on the bear where it belongs. My daughter is 3 1/2 and has had no trouble in using each of these items seperately. She has fun getting the bear dressed.If anything I would say that this toy is so much better than one of the stuffed animals that has all of the zippers/buttons/shoe laces on them because with this toy there is only one task at a time and a child won't get so distracted easily.This is a heavy duty, quality toy that I think will last a very long time. Quality I've come to expect from Melissa & Doug doesn't disappoint."
3,Difficult to use,I usually like Melissa & Doug products but this one is not great and not worth the money. The puzzle pieces are very hard to work- it was hard for me (an adult) to unbuckle the one piece and the belt is so firm that its hard to do too. I even found the zipper a bit tricky. Its not likely my almost 2 year old twins will be able to use this anytime soon. (other than carrying the puzzle pieces around the house)
1,Looks great but too difficult...,"I love Melissa and Doug products, but this puzzle is not up to their typical standards. It is too difficult for an adult to complete, let alone a 3 year old child. It is a great concept and looks fun with bright colors. My child enjoys putting the puzzle together, but I would not recommend the product for a young child to help learn basic skills. Here are a few specific issues with it:-belt buckle is too tight, so impossible to undo-button and zipper there is not enough fabric space to do it-plastic buckle is facing the wrong direction and too tight to open-pieces pop out, which makes it difficult to accomplish the learning task"
3,Fixed it!!! Buy some glue!,"This thing is great now that I glued all the pieces on...Other reviewers are right - it shouldn't be a puzzle. BUT, if you buy some nice strong glue and adhere the pieces, it's wonderful. The kids play with it all the time. If it weren't a puzzle to begin with, I'd give it a 5 star rating."
4,A good theoretical book on discrete neural networks,"This book is more aimed towards researchers in the field of computational complexity, who are studying the computational limitations of discrete neural nets, in terms of depth, size, and connection weights. From this perspective it seems very good, if not excellent. On the other hand, aside from coverage of the perceptron learning algorithm and Hopfield networks the book has little in terms of applications."
4,Eyes of Blue Ahead of Time,"Not much info out there for this band or album, but in my opinion this is a psych masterpiece and is in heavy rotation on my player.This is Eyes of Blue's 1968 Mercury album Crossroads of Time.It's a tight sophisticated LP that in many places is quite advanced for the time. One of the few Beatle covers I can stand (Yesterday) and a punky version of Love's 7+7 Is...., but my favorite is World of Emotion, which just puts a smile on my face whenever I hear it.Not far behind is Love Is the Law, but the whole album is highly listenable without the usual novelties and throwaway tracks psych LPs are often known for. Brilliant!!!!"
4,Pilates Balance Ball,"The video was easy to understand. However, because it is PAL format, it only plays on my desktop or laptop computers"
5,Alexander's Ragtime Band,"the quality of the video and the sound track were excellent - much better than I had expected from this old movie.The story isn't much, but as a vehicle for wonderful music and a look back at the stars of yesteryear, this is a winner. (I saw it as a late movie in 1962 and was so pleased to find that it was all I had remembered.)"
5,This was a great gift to give,I personally didn't watch the movie. It was a gift. The feedback was great from the recipient. Loved the movie. dvd in perfect condition. buy from this vendor. Fast delivery.
5,"They don't make ""em like this anymore!","LIKE I SAID THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE TO MAKE MOVIES , GOOD , CLEAN ONES !!"
5,"Another Faye, Ameche, and Power classic","This trio teams up again, as In Old Chicago and Sally, Irene, and Mary, for a great old movie classic. Vaudville comedian Eddie Collins appears in all three. In this film, he plays Corporal Collins in the army barracks scene, wrestling with his t-shirt."
4,Great Entertainment!,"This was one of 20th Century Fox's biggest grossing movies for several years and it still holds up almost 70 years later. My favorite number: the rollickin ""Everybody's Doing It"" musical sequence with Ellen Terry in fine form, as is her partner (can't find his name). My one minor complaint: story bogs down toward end with Alice Faye fighting, fighting her love for gorgeous Tyrone Power. Couldn't understand her logic in hiding away from him. Wonderful to see a young, brassy Ethel Merman. Wish this had been filmed in Technicolor which was still very new."
5,Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!,"I have had the ""vinyl"" version of this album for years, and it has been one of my all time favorites. The songs (although not all originals) are performed as though they are originals. I was thrilled to finally find this album in CD form. I highly recommend this album to rock, blues, and jazz fans alike. Even if you are not familiar with Brian Auger or Julie (Driscoll) Tippets, try it...you'll be glad you did."
2,Not bad just not great,"Text content is very good and the reader can learn a lot from it, but the pictures are not much help. There are much better books with great examples."
2,These are NOT leather as stated in the description...,"These boots are very cute and comfortable. However they are NOT leather as stated in the description. They are clearly labeled ALL MANMADE MATERIALS on the inside of the boot. Since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal, but the price I paid is not worth it for non-leather boots."
1,NOT REAL LEATHER!!!,"I was very dissapointed when I received these boots. The description clearly states that the boots are leather, but they are NOT."
5,Best Book I've Read This Year...,"...And I read a lot of books. If you are looking for a book of poems by a smart, humane, passionate poet, here's the book you need to read. If you're tired of the pretentious incomprehensible word constructions of the hip ironic poets, read these poems instead. If you like poetry that's both musically rich and emotionally adult, complex and yet precise, here's your book. The poem ""Hyper,"" about his daughter's diagnosis of ADHD, is by itself worth the price of the book. I'll be reading this collection for years to come."
5,la musica from Italy.,"Having been to Sorrento, Italy, on holiday, I heard many of these enchanting melodies in restaurants and cafes. They realy are lovely compositions, and on this cd the Bruno Bertone Orchestra plays them beautifully. All the tracks on this recording are synonimous with Italy, so if you've holidayed in Italy, this cd will bring you back there !"
4,The Best Basketball Game Ever,"NBA Street V3 is the best streetball game that EA ever came up with. If you thought volume 2 was good then you should get volume 3 becuase it is even better. You can create your own baller and give him or her a team or start the Street Challenge to build your baller's reputation. The dunk contest is totally awesome(even though it is also totally unrealistic too). You can play against your friends, make your own kicks, choose your ballers clothes from a totally huge wardrobe, etc. It is totally fun! The only reason I gave this game's overall 4 stars is because of the little glitches that it has sometimes where the game can't really keep up with you(if you get what I'm sayin). But I totally love this game. It's pretty addictive because it is so fun. Anyone who likes either basketball or NBA Street V1 or V2 should get this game soon. It is the best EA game ever!!! I hope EA will make an NBA Street V4. ^_^"
5,EA street did it agian,"With the third installment this game is awesome. The game is finally online and its awesome online. The graphics are mind blowing, and theres tons of new modes like the dunk mode. The only con. is that they took out some good players like M.Jordon. Plus the guy who talks during the game is lame. its awesome so rent it or buy it!"
2,Not as good as the last one,NBA street volume 1 was a great game. Volume 2 was even better but volume 3 was just awful. The moves and the graphics are just not great.
4,Streetlife,"My son loves the Street series, but I think that this is his favorite. He has a Playstation 3, but for some reason he is back on his old system. I was so lucky to find this game. The vendor provided gast service and a quality product. Thanks"
2,Please skip this one,"This is a piece of junk - the cars are supposed to hook together and be able to be dragged along by an 18 month old. The problem with this is, the cars don't LATCH together (they don't click into place) - they just set one car upon another. This means that when the child tries to pull the cars, he or she just ends up pulling the front car out, dumping the Winnie the Pooh character on the floor, and swinging the front car in the air. The ONLY way to get this to roll along on the floor is to pull the string along, parallel to the floor. The only child you could convince to do that would be older than 2, if not 3. And at that point, this toy is a little beneath them.Terrible, stupid design. I'm glad I got it as a gift, I would have hated to have spent any money on it."
2,There are some better DVDS out there,"I was a bit disappointed in this video. I am 25 weeks pregnant and it just wasn't challenging enough for me. Admittedly, I am one of those people that hasn't found a prenatal DVD that they think is enough of a challenge and a complete workout but I truly found this DVD to be boring and easy. The only highlight in this workout is the 11 minute lower body workout. My buns did get a good burn in that section. I don't think that 11 minute portion is worth spending money for though. You can find some better prenatal workouts. The ones that I do think give an okay workout are: Suzanne Bowen Long and Lean and Summer Sanders prenatal workout."
2,In pain after ward,"I got this dvd so I didnt get fat every where, but when I tried it it was very difficult. I was so sore the next day and I think I pulled a muscle in my side. Which pregnancy is already uncomfortable enough, I dont need more pain."
2,I did not like the workout + damaged DVD,"This workout was not for me. It did not feel good, was too easy or too hard in some parts, and some moves were annoying/uncomfortable. I liked the section on pelvic floor exercises. I did not care for the style of the instructor (too bubbly?). She also did not seem to be in as good of a shape as other prenatal instructors. I much rather prefer the Perfect Pregnancy Workout by Karyne Steben - perfect pace, sequencing, makes me feel great and energized. Other ones I like (although not as much the Perfect) is MommyShape Prenatal Complete 3-in-1 and Summer Sanders' Prenatal Workout.The DVD arrived loose in the case and scratched, and did not play well on my DVD player. I was glad to send it back."
5,SB - Careful Confessions,"Excellent CD. The first one of Sara: Undertow and Red are one of the greatest songs in this album. The version of Gravity and Fairytale are way better than the ones recorded for A Little Voice.Reffering to shipment, the CD cover came a little broken; i asume this cd is kind of old, and the stock have suffered some damages."
5,Amazing voice and such talent,"I was walking along Bruin walk on my way to my apartment when i heard music playing in the quad. It's a regular thing almost daily, when I heard something better than the hip hop DJ, or an electric punk band, it was Sara Barielles. Very talented and very stunning. I bought her album 'Careful Conffessions"" and was amazed at what she is capable of.At school I only had time for part of a song, but what she played and what I heard were fun and playful.If you're even curious her CD is for you."
5,Emergency Newborn Care,"An excellent, well-written concise book with easy-to-understand format for ALL emergency personnel. One can ""gain confidence"" in caring for a newborn by reading this book. The book covers such topics such as resuscitation, vital signs, intubation, IV placement & fluids, medications and EMS Delivery scenarios. It also has an extensive bibliography. Recommended!"
5,A statistical modeling text that is both clear and throrough.,"This text is especially valuable because it is written in clear and concise language. It thus serves the needs of the biostatistical community while remaining accessible to the non-biostatistician. The latter is what is so often lacking in textbooks in this discipline. The new 2009 edition builds on and adds to the strengths of the first. As a clinical investigator, I turn to this first when I have a complex data issue that I need clarification about."
4,This is one of the most charming of the Miss Marple stories.,I highly recommend this book to Agatha Christie fans of Miss Marple stories. It has a particular charm involving an elegant old-style hotel and its seem-to-be prominent guests. It has been a re-read for me for years.
4,Fast-moving,"This is a fast moving mystery where murder takes second place to a whole series of robberies. An intriguing story, though I was disappointed that I had to delve through 80% of the book before any murder took place. Miss Marple herself also plays second fiddle to some Scotland Yard detective. She renders help, but it is not clear that the cops couldn't solve it without her."
2,Impoverished Christie/Not Worth a Gander,"Lacks suspense. Plausible characters are far and in between. Not as horrid as Passage to Frankfurt which is unreadable. That's a plus. But the whole finale is ridiculous. That Christie uses this novel to reminisce about the loss of of England's traditional ways is endearing, but not a vital enough element. Clearly, whenever the old gal starts trying to address bigger crimes, she loses her way. This one has a train robbery and a crime syndicate and much below par writing. If this is anyone's first Christie novel, it will no doubt be their last."
2,A weak outing,One of her weaker Marple books. Christie's crime syndicate plot rings false. Not as good as her usual formula. Not enough Marple. Too much time spent on characters that seem cartoonish and false. Overall pretty unsatisfying book.
2,well......not the best,"I've loved every Christie book I've read. This one kinda stunk. Miss Marple may as well have not even been in it. It's as though she was added as an afterthougt to the story. The writing, as always, was great and engaging. But the story itself was DULL as dirt and totally predictable. I love Agatha Christie books because they always find a way to surprize me and this one simply didn't fit the bill. I didn't find it overly complicated like some other readers mentioned, but I read it quickly and didn't give myself time to forget who the characters were.Very dissapointed that I paid that much for a sorta crappy book :("
3,An okay read,"I was pretty engaged throughout the story, but found the ending implausible and not well-developed. I also thought that the Blake character, the flamboyant lady, was pretty over-the-top and unconvincing."
2,I am never visiting this hotel again.,"I am shocked, but I must admit, that I have come across an Agatha Christie that I did not enjoy at all. It is dull, confusing, and the ending is poor, but it was impossible to figure out the ending. If you are going to read Agatha Chrisie's books, I reccomend that you start with Sleeping Murder (THE BEST) or And Then There Were None/ Ten Little Indians (THE SECOND BEST). Save this one till the end."
3,Not the best AC book,"Though it has a surprising twist at the end, this Agatha Christie book is slower than the others. Good expression and description of characters, though it doesnt really make much sense where Chief-Inspector Davy finds out who is actually behind all the crimes that link to the hotel. Not the best AC book, but its still is a good read."
3,The Murder at the Vicarage.,"That is the title of the edition I read. Colonel Protheroe is an unlikable curmudgeon that enjoys inflicting his personality upon others. When the man is found murdered in the Vicar's study, no one is very upset and the quick confession of an individual seen fleeing the scene of the crime leads all to believe that is that. Then another confesses to the crime, and another...and there is that matter of the ill timed clock and the incorrect time on the note that Protheroe was scribbling to the Vicar when he died.Agatha Christie's first Miss Marple mystery makes for diverting, albeit unmemorable, reading. As most mystery readers know, just about anything by her, even on an off day, is essential reading for mystery fans. Recommended."
4,More Like A Movie,"This novel by the ever wonderful Agatha Christie is very exact and detailed. It had a twisted plot and suspicious characters. But! It was also from several people's point of view. The scene kept changing so you had to say ""Okay, who is seeing this and what are they most likely to think"". In other titles by Christie the story is from one point of view. The entire story is based around one person's story and mode of thinking. That is why I give Bertram's four and not five stars."
5,Liberating!,"The Liberation of the Jew is a riveting self-analysis of the Jewish psyche. To be Jewish is to belong to a despised group, this is an axiom that is hardly touched upon in the book, and rightly so. Now GIVEN that you are universally despised what on earth could you do about it? Not much. You could accept that hate, pretend it doesn't exist, change your name, get a nose job, marry out, bury in, whatever. None tackles the tragic predicament - you life is going to be crippled one way or another. Well, Albert Memmi does offer a kind of a `cure' at the very end of the book. My suggestion is to read the whole book first. The diagnosis is far more interesting than the prescription...."
2,Two Letters Come to Mind: P and U,"This gets two stars because it's Johnny and the boys, but getting two just for showing up is not enough. Horribly recorded with a mix by Helen Keller and with a slipcase designed by a hater of CDs, the contents of this abomination--regardless of the fine liner notes--are repulsive and are puzzling, as in, Why was this released? For the true studio Heartbreakers please consider the Lost Mixes, for the live experience there are DTK and the Max's records. P as well as U....."
3,deserves a gold medal,this album although i've only heard half of it is really good although i do rate goldfinger +blink 182 over them this album is still worth buying and i know i would buy it if i had any spare cash.
3,funny fit,I have small hands and jammed my wrist during boxing. I needed a tight fitting sleeve for support. I ordered medium and it was loose and very stretched out across the palm. Had to return it.
1,Returned them,"They ran extremely small. Even though I had measured my hand, still got wrong size. They run way to small and tight."
2,size guide is wrong,"I tried the small first - based on the measuring guide, it should have fit. Could not get it on. My wrist measures 6.5"" - based on the guide the medium should have been an easy fit. It's so tight it causes more pain. I've given up on this brand."
4,One for the archives,"I'm a surfer and have generally not been into the whole surf movie thing but I got Sprout and thought it was a good show. The music was pretty good as well and I put this in the iTunes to play as background on the weekends when I'm just hacking around the house or if I'm just thinking about the beach when there's no waves.If you're into the whole shredder, aggro, bro-dude scene this probably isn't for you. Stick with something loud like the Suicide Machines and have fun with all that. But if you're into trying new things and looking for a different line than the rest of the heads out there then book the trip and bring this along."
1,NOT THE ORIGIONAL SOUNDTRACK,"This isn't the same as the origional, which is very good. Here are the origional tracks:1 Practice Twice - Sam Prekop Original Soundtrack2 Stolen Moments - Oliver Nelson Original Soundtrack3 On The Low - Hope Sandoval Original Soundtrack4 Of The Periphery - Him Original Soundtrack5 Find Enjoyment - Ray Barbee Original Soundtrack6 When I Goose Step - The Shins Original Soundtrack7 Butter Nut - Sprout House Band Original Soundtrack8 By Fist And Fury - Tommy Guerrero Original Soundtrack9 Salt The Skies - Tortoise Original Soundtrack10 Banderilla - Calexico Original Soundtrack11 Demon Lover - Superwolf Original Soundtrack12 Spanish Flowers - Sprout House Band Original Soundtrack13 Rained - Tommy Guerrero Original Soundtrack14 Got My Sunshine - Mojave 3 Original Soundtrack"
5,Great Book,"This is a great book for any fly tier. Joseph Bates knew and fished with many originators of the Rangeley style streamers, the history, pictures, and recipes in this book are priceless. Very glad I bought it, I reference it often."
4,Classic Chesterton,"This is a compilation of essays written for his newspaper column. I am always impressed by his poetic and detailed descriptions of the world around him. He covers a variety of subjects and always turns the observations about life into truths that I did not expect. Among my favorites: A Piece of Chalk--where a drawing exercise turns into a lesson on the nature of truth, The Dragon's Grandmother--on why we should read fairy tales to our children, and Twelve Men--the best explanation I have read on why we have juries made of our peers and not professional jurors."
5,Chesterton is always a great read!,"His style is of course very different from more contemporary authors, but once you get into it, excellent. And Kindle value for his books is the best!"
4,"Brief, sharp, soft-core romp","A filandering club-owner and his lusty, but distant, wife learn a hard lesson about the value of their marriage. A minor, but solid offering from the Meyer canon. Features superb photograpy, editing and a small cast of stunning ladies as usual. In this reviewer's humble opinion, Anne Chapman may be the sexiest starlet Meyer ever worked with, and that's saying alot."
4,Built on Practice,"Dreyfus is able to write one of the strongest intros to Being and Time because of his background: instead of spending his entire career trying to work out the esoteric details of this text, as many history of philosophy professors do, he as appropriated his understanding into his own unique and important work on modern technologies. The result is that he is able to relate this understanding, although of course it will have its personal emphases (as any intro does... the only text that lets you know truly and fully what Heidegger is up to without a slant, is Being and Time itself), clearly and effectively; other scholars let their specialist debates overly influence and complicate their introductory work.The only work about Being and Time that deserves five stars, however, is Being and Time... and even though this work is notoriously difficult, please do try to read it primarily and then use these aids for clarification if you ares stuck."
2,Not the first choice.,Even the Professor himself in his podcast lectures advises to get the William Blattner version first. He said there were many things he was going to change in the next edition of this book.
2,high school football coach,"great book for a beginning coach, but for someone that coaches the defensive line for a living it is not a very good book."
3,Seat covers very thin,"Just received the Grant cover and stretched it over my Toyota 4Runner leather driver seat. No problems with the fit and it will doubtlessly protect the seat from water and dirt damage. I thought I was receiving a heavy duty material which was treated with a water resistant chemical (Note: it does not say one way or the other in the Grant information.) Instead, the material is very thin nylon/poly weave with a shiny rubberized backing similar in thickness and construction to tent rain flys and waterproof ponchos. I am concerned about what the rubberized surface might do to my leather seat, so I may end up stretching two old T shirts over the bottom seat and back as a layer in between. I would not buy it again."
5,Cool gift for muscle car lovers,My husband and my father in law spent most of Christmas afternoon watching these together. Good bonding experience for them.
5,Lee Michaels: Classic San Francisco,"A classic un-doctored live album of a musician who more than held his own in the ""Florence"" of rock and roll music. A protege (and sometimes collaborator)of the Airplane, Dead, Quick Silver, et.al. produced this great music that sounded as good live as on vinyl."
5,Very Pleased,"I was ecstatic when my album arrived and I immediately threw it onto the turntable...what great memories. The album was as described, played well and arrived in a timely manner. Thank you for the prompt service."
1,NO CD-R's PLEASE,"Before you buy this please be aware it is a CDR. That's right, the label does not want to spend a few dollars for a re-issue so they are taking the cheap way out and offering CD-r's. If you want an original factory pressed CD you can usually find them even brand new but they are about twice the price but it is still better than a cdr by far. Look close at the product description to see what you are getting."
5,WOW,"What an organist!... I was a Lee fan back in high school when Lee was on the radio late 60's early 70's. Sad he gave up on music, because the industry treated him badly. He sure can belt out a tune and make the keys scream. I have everything he ever put out, on vinyl and CD"
2,NO CDR'S PLEASE (2),"After reading the above review, I noticed the one I purchased was a CD'R also. This was one of my favorites when it came out in 1969. You can tell the sound is not as sharp as it should be. I hope this is not a thing to come with more re-issues."
5,Lee Michaels: a top keyboard rock virtuoso,"One of the first albums, in my day, to turn me on to keyboards as a viable featured rock instrument. Michaels is able to create the full orchestra sound with merely an organ and a drum set. Vocals are noteworthy. Glad this was re-issued as a CD. A must for rock keyboard enthusiasts."
4,track list correction,This is a really good album especially if you dig keyboard music. Michaels is a keyboard legend. I had this album when it first came out now I have the CD. However the track list is incorrect. Where you have the song Frost on the medley it should be Frosty's [it is his drum solo] and there is a final tune on the medley that's not listed it's [ Think i'll go back ] Just check the CD you'll see what I mean. Weather or not you correct the track list I don'tcare but it's a great album.
5,Great album,"I had all but forgotten about this album. I was 12 when my oldest brother brought it home one day; I ended up just about taking it over from him, and wore it out. I was bummed when I saw it's out-of-print, but then found it's available in its entirety as a purchased download. The best $9.99 I ever spent!Great keyboards, great vocals, and great drums (I for one never bored with Frosty's ten-minute solo!).To this day I can't fathom how Lee Michaels manages to play those bass lines with his feet, while playing some of the most incredible organ and singing lead vocal all at the same time."
5,Organ Heaven!,"Being a 28 year from London I've only just discovered Lee Michaels, I've been missing out!I've always been into Organ/Rock/Soul/Blues, English Bands I grew up listening to like The Animals, The Small Faces etc.But Lee Michaels has so much Energy and Soul in his voice and with the hammond it's like a marriage made in heaven, great stuff!I first heard 'Tell Me How Do You Feel' on a Hip-Hop BreakBeat Album a few years back and fell in love not only with the break but the whole tune, it remains one of my all time favourite's!"
1,*perfect*,Why didn't Tori put these two amazing b-sides onto choirgirl? I always find myself asking me this everytime I hear these two wonderful songs. Bachelorette has that smokey snake charming type melody that always gets stuck in my head. I love you Tori.
4,Sweetly Tasteful,"The singles on this CD are wonderful. Another addition to the collecters stash of her music, if haven't already included. Purple People is the second song that has a very mellow and sultry sound. One of which should listened to on a hot summer day, in a hammock, swaying in the breeze, to get the complete effect. The third is Bachlorette, an upbeat tune that even captures Tori's laugh at the end. You know she had fun singing this particular song. This single is one of my fav's. Topped off with Spark, it has Tori's powerful voice which flows from the sadness of Spark, to the sleepiness of Purple People, finished with the spunky with a dash of salsa in Bachlorette. The many sides of Tori in three songs... I like!!!!"
5,As Usual a Great New Single From Tori,"If you like ""Spark"" but don't want to buy the album (""From The Choirgirl Hotel"") this is defintely for you!! In addition to ""Spark"" you will get two new, unreleased songs that just might presuade you to buy ""Chiorgirl Hotel"". ""Purple People"" is a slow, nice, jazzy little tune that is very catchy. In an instant, I assure you, you'll be hooked on the song. With it's slow pluse and quiet beat it's great as a relaxer. ""Bachlorette"" (one of my favorite songs ever), on the other hand, is a quick-moving, fast-paced song. It's flows so perfectly...it's a really good song to sing-a-long to!! You'll probably find yourself doing that if you can figure out the lyrics...it's tough, believe me!! Anyway, it's a great, inexpensive CD that is really worth it,"
5,A stunning single,"Spark is an incredilble song that leaves me breathless every time I hear it. The two bee-sides are also great, especially Bachelorette, a slinky, sexy song which makes you want to dance."
5,Best CD since Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness!,"At first, I was sceptical, but Zamfir has made me a believer. The fact that one man can make such sweet music upon my ears. Zamfir is going to be the official Christmas/Y2K music in my house this year, and hearing it on the subs in my car is nothing short of amazing."
5,A 'must' for any wine buff who wants to latest news on the greatest wines,"Seeking a pocket guide to the wine world which offers the latest insider's information on new vintages, upcoming trends, new discoveries, and the latest harvest predictions? You can't go wrong with Wine Report 2006, which was rated the 'Best Wine Book in the World 2004 and 2005' by Gourmand International: it packs a wealth of updated facts in a truly pocket-sized - albeit thick - edition and is a 'must' for any wine buff who wants to latest news on the greatest wines."
2,Review the contents before buying this book.,"This book may be helpful to some wine lovers. But, there's problem in theorganization of the book. For example, only 9 pages are allocated toBordeaux wine. It's the same number of pages for Lebanon wine. I'm nota fan of Bordeaux wine. But, most wine lover will need more informationof Bordeaux, Italy and Chille wines contained in this book."
5,Appears Lighter in Color than Pictured,"I'm glad the stones are lighter in color than pictured, because in my opinion they are more attractive than pictured. The stones are multi-faceted, and the butterfly backings are just the right size. I never cared for those tiny butterfly backings that are nearly impossible to find if you drop one on the floor. Lovely earrings."
4,I really enjoyed this book.,"As a biracial teenager I was delighted to read a book that addresses the issue of race identity. Judy Scales-Trent makes some excellent points regarding race divisions in today's society. Not only does Ms. Scales-Trent present her information in such a way that anyone can identify with, but all the information in this book has been researched and is quite valid. I learned about things, such as the racial purity law, that I never new existed. It really made me think about what my race means and how it shapes who I am. This is a great book for both teenagers and adults, biracial or not."
1,Incorrect Information,"Once again, Amazon has made a mistake. This film does not have anything to do with, nor does it star any of the actors from, Absolutely Fabulous.Why do they do this?"
5,Another bargain,"5 STARS because once again another bargain TO me this is like music samples on a CD rather than the best of or greatest hits albums .The cds are clear sounding,this is worth to buy/This is perfect for those to want to hear sample of music."
5,The Dog is the Key,"Poirot arrives on the scene and Death follows. The Key to solving the crime is the little dog who is blamed for the accident that nearly kills his mistress, but keep your eye on the ball (in this case the one the dog plays with.) Poirot learns from the Dog named Bob; Maneuvering past the strange old ladies who see and speak to ghosts and other suspects to chase down the true murderer. This is a great movie in which the master sleuth gets help from a smart yet quiet assistant. Great fun."
4,"The Lake District, Bob, and seances.","The Lake Distruct forms a beautiful backdrop for this Poirot episode. Then there is Bob (Poirot: ""what make of dog is this""?) the Fox Terrier, that holds the key to unraveling the crime - and he's fun to watch. The down-side? The seances are an embarassment (and irrelevant), so I find myself skipping past them. Not as good as some in the series, but I just can't help myself - I have to get them all!"
4,The original Lambada,This CD had exactly what I was looking for which is the original Lambada song. It is fantastic and sure brings back a lot of memories. The rest of the CD becomes monotonous so you lose interest after the 4th song.
2,Mikasa Wine glasses,"I needed 2 wine glasses that matched the 2 I had broken. They arrived in good condition, but upon inspection, I realized that these were seconds, not perfect new glasses. They wobble since the bases are slightly warped, and one has a chip on the rim that has been polished so it's not sharp. The price was right, but the quality was something to be desired."
1,Don't waste your money on this book,This book provides very little insight to the use of WinRunner. This is by far the worst computer book I have ever bought and I have a lot of them.
1,Terrible!,"... It seems obvious that it was thrown together on someone's printer in order to take advantage of the fact that there are no other third party Winrunner books on the market.I can't believe I was dumb enough to buy it. If you do get the urge to buy this book, do everyone a favor and instead donate the money to your local soup kitchen..."
3,A good introductory book for automated testing,Contains many examples which helps in learning the tool.But the book was not bound well and I would not prefer to buy it for that price
1,"If You do not know Winrunner , do not write a book !!!","Folks , the book is a complete waist . The author is a very unexpirensed user of Winrunner . It does not tell you anythingusefull , half of it is a copy of a Mercury installation manual( which you are getting with Winrunner anyway). I allready suggected to one of my freinds to write a book about Winrunner.Again , do not buy that book ! It is absolutely empty !!"
3,Helped Me...,"but i wish it were longer. really got me going fast. i like the sense of humor that was in the book. it kind of reads like a ""dummy's"" book.the web testing was a nice touch.yeah, it was overpriced, but so are most of the software testing books."
2,Not bad for beginners but not bound well for the price ...,"Good book to get started with a basic (and I do mean basic) introduction to Mercury Interactive's automated testing tool, WinRunner. Authors did a good job of good examples and discussion of the overall concepts of WinRunner and test automation. The binding of the book is NOT paperback though. It is more like academic binding with a plastic binder. This normally doesn't bother me, but being the size of a ""For Dummies ..."" quick reference and carrying a [cost] price tag, I took issue. Probably would not purchase unless you can't get your company to send you through the training course somewhere."
4,Good Book for beginners,This book helped me to get started on WinRunner without much programming skills.
3,Hmmm...,"Well, one thing about this stand is that it does hold the the soldering iron in place. I was pretty disappointed when I saw the tiny little sponge provided in the box, wrapped in plastic. It doesn't fit the drain proper. I'm not too sure if I will need to ""inflate"" it with water, but nothing really indicates how this thing should be prepared and assembled - not that it really requires an instruction manual, but if your sponge is gonna be this small... ... ..."
3,A style all his own,"Robby Krieger is an American Rock original with a style all his own. He is one of the greatest and proves it time and again with his doors recordings and his solo efforts. to bad people dont sit up and take notice they are missing some truley great playing,over 30 years worth. A master guitarest!"
4,Landscape of Music,"When are people going to learn how to spell this ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME LEGENDS NAME?? It is spelled R-O-B-B-Y, NOT R-O-B-B-I-E!!Even beside the song clips his name is spelled wrong and on this page it is spelled wrong. Amazing!This collection of songs is in Robby's style of flamenco, classical, and jazz, with a touch of rock that is a creation that immediately identifies this master musician. Robby's career which includes the above mentioned styles has shown him to be genious and tasteful in past recordings and especially in this CD as well. Melancholy, mellow, jazzy, distorted guitar sounds weave in, out and through this CD that covers several flavors of musical styles. These combined tracks into one CD, creates another masterpiece which is delivered only the way one of the world's greatest guitarists could deliver it.T. ROY TAYLOR"
5,Hilarious.,"Great episode. My favorite part is the end when Mac gets mad at Dennis. If you've never seen IASIP, you have to start."
5,Hilarious,"It is the beginning of a hilariously witty, intelligent yet mindless, bizzare, politically incorrect, perfect comedy series for the mature yet immature adult. Each episode is short, but very sweet."
4,Movie review,My son requested this for Christmas - i had never seen the series and found myself watching it for an hour. Very funny and enjoyable. They tackle some pretty heavy moral issues.
5,Can't stop laughing,I got this for a Christmas present the year it came out and I still can't stop laughing.Four narcissistic idiots that own a bar together! Hilarious!I do agree with some of the reviews that suggest the show could do without Danny Devito
5,Great Cast! Great Show!,"Dennis, Dee, Mac, Charlie, and Frank team up to create a great comedy for television! Every joke is a screamer and with 17 episodes in this DVD set, you'll be sure to have countless laughs. Never mind the price! Buy this DVD set today!"
2,Waiting for it to be funny,"Our college-aged kids told us how funny this series is so we started at series one to catch up. We were ""challenged"" to find its humor. It was one idea for the whole show and it went slowly...but we persevered thru the first 7 or so thinking it was us. When the kids came home they admitted it didn't get funny till Danny Devito comes on the scene, which is NOT on the first CD. False advertising on the jacket with his face the biggest? I guess it serves as character background. Better to start maybe with later series with DD in it already."
5,"Awesome dvd, great price and shipped fast",I love this show and I found it here at amazon. I jumped on it and had it shipped for gift. I highly recommend this DVD and going through amazon to get it.
4,FX is killing the value of this,"It's hard to find any complaint about this DVD set. You probably already know what the show is, so no need to run through that kind of stuff. The extras are a little bit lacking, but no complaints on that. The only problem is that FX is running through all of these shows on Thursday nights after each new episode they run."
5,One of the best shows on television!,"As a person who rarely watches TV these days, it has to be an amazing show to convert me into a fan. Sunny manages to achieve this goal and more. The cast of characters are great and work well together, the situations go above and beyond the normal sitcom, and NOTHING is held sacred. If you've ever laughed at anything inappropriate in your life, this is the perfect show for you."
5,"Anarchistic, absurd, completely hysterical","Rob McElhenney has created an existentialist masterpiece. I am convinced this guy is a genius. His anarchic, absurd humor is so perfectly expressed in this show, which really picked up steam in Season 2 and has been chugging along ever since. My sincere wish is that this becomes like ""South Park"" which is in I think Season 16 or 17 right now and shows no signs of stopping. My recommendation is to watch this show from the very beginning because it's very dadaist and self referential. You really have to know who all the primary and ancilliary characters are to truly appreciate how the show has grown and developed over the years. Kind of amazing to see how total self absorption can be so funny and interesting."
5,Over the top outrageous comedy--every episode ingenius,Best sit comedy of last few years!Guaranteed laughter and hysterics!Like an over the top modernized Seinfeld...characters and show really push the envelope on very serious topics to generate laughter.Danny Devito has not shined a smuch since TAXI. The other relatively unknown characters are magnificent espec as ana esemble cast.Best money I ever spent!
5,SUNNY PHILLY!,"I laugh so hard everytime I watch this series! It has the funniest and sickest characters since STRANGERS W/ CANDY and ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT. I recently showed several episodes to a friend who had never heard of the show, and we were just hysterical w/ laughter. Very cleverly written w/ fully developed characters. So politically incorrect w/ fantastic humor. A liitle concerned w/ the language though. A certain curse word is used quite often which, being absolutely no prude, bothers me because it seems a bit gratuitous because its a cable show. But this collection is worth every dime!"
4,Really funny,I think it's the best one they have done because you get to see the other side of them especially dee and Charlie
5,Sunny is Funny,"I say this is the best comedy on TV, no lie. It's not dressed up and it's not PC. Yet at the same time, it's witty writing, superb acting, and quality production overall. The titles of the episode reflect this perfectly - simple and hilarious. And the characters are so genuine - I know these people; they say what everyone's thinking; you feel like you're right there with them. I can't believe I've never heard of these guys before, they are that good!!As an aside, the show also manages to give the viewer a subtle sense of where Philly really is -- demographically, racially, economically. And Season 1 pre-Danny DiVito is as funny - if not better; DiVito merely adds to the well-established routine of the other main characters. I'm anxiously awaiting next season......"
2,It's always sunny in philadelphia 1 & 2,The DVD set came in fast and it was sealed well. But some of the disc holders inside were broken so the DVDs moved around and some were scratched.
2,Great Product. Bad Shipping.,"I LOVE ""It's Always Sunny""! The DVD itself worked great, was complete, etc. However, the case was cracked & broken and looked awful. Considering I was giving it as a gift, it was less than desirable. I ended up keeping it for myself & buying a non-damaged copy from BestBuy."
3,A TWISTED POCKET PAL TO HELP YOU WIN (AND LOSE) PALS,"This teeny tome (it measures 3.5 by 3.5 inches) is the perfect pocket-sized primer of used (and abused) proverbs and sayings, bastardized by some famous folks to suit their own applause-getting needs. Think Roseanne: ""The fastest way to a man's heart is through his chest."" Think Rhonda Boozer: ""A bird in the hand is dead."" Think John Lennon: ""Beauty is in the eye of the newt and a hair of the dog."" (Huh?) Think Dorothy Parker: ""Don't put all your eggs into one bastard."" Think Woody Allen: ""TB or not TB, that is the congestion."" Mae's here, as is Lenny and Groucho and W.C. It's a shame the cover is so misleading: ""Do unto others ... then run"" was muttered by Benny Hill, but Groucho. Here, the book ain't on the Marx."
3,In New China,"Do not expect sex or intimate scenes in Mongkok, which is already the most populated area in the world. Mafia does it business by hiring killers and prostitutes from mainland China where value of money still differs from one in Hong Kong, and a local police force tries keeping things quite, while annihilating a drug trade by deploying not-so-legal actions itself sometimes. In addition, it is educative for providing a translation of ""Hong Kong"".Handsome actors, beautiful women and Hong Kong views make murdering and fighting more consumable."
5,Rocking The Night Away In Mongkok,"Excellent, Excellent Movie!!! I have watched it several times and have not tired of it yet. Daniel Wu gives a wonderful acting performance as a mainland Chinese country bumpkin hired as a hitman in the Mongkok area of Hong Kong. The people who hired him for the hit, some of the sleazy people in the hotel he stays at and eventually the police all come after him and he tries to stay one step ahead of all of them with a prostitute he has befriended in tow. Non stop action, suspense, drama and violence are the highlights of this movie. It shows the seedier, shabbier aspects of Hong Kong and is very realistic. The plot was well developed and the actors all did a wonderful job. This movie not only shows the crowded streets of Mongkok in the daytime but also is a view of Hong Kong after dark which adds a lot more scarey texture and edginess to the movie. A highly Recommended film."
4,European Polka Hits,"When you want to dance and need to get your feet going, put this cd in and turn it up. If this one cann""t get your heart started see your doctor. Quickly... Seriously some of the best music going. Enjoy!"
2,What WAS She Thinking?,"I can't remember the last time a romance novel was full of so many mean, nasty characters. I usually enjoy Cheryl Holt's books, but I could barely finish this one. The heroine is certainly far more forgiving than I would have been in her place."
2,Haven't we read this before?,"I love this author, and read everything she publishes, usually a good read. This one not so much. I would swear I've read this already, and had to check the published date to see if it was a reprint. The plot, characters and just about everything else are not an original for Ms. Holt, and I was disappointed to that regard. Still, an entertaining read for a couple of hours."
1,Female degradation and sodomy - gross,"I'm not picky. I just want some romance, erotica, and a decent story. This book was offensive. Repeated ""sex"" scenes that were actually rape, including tying up a young girl (who is a 'villain' but come on) and sodomy. I'm liberal, I'm forgiving, but this book was unforgiveable and just gross and icky. Felt like I needed to take a shower (or 3) after reading it."
1,Convuluted Plot and weak characters,"I struggle to find a good romance novel these days. Between the vampires and other paranormal creatures, there aren't many publishing houses printing contemporary or historical novels for the devoted romance reader. When I read the book jacket, I thought I'd discovered a nice steamy historical novel. Unfortunately, I discovered a novel with contrived characters who related to each other for the sake of sex. The heroine was weak, the hero unlikeable and the secondary characters ranged from twisted to evil. In a disfunctional world, I search for strong family relationships, which this novel lacked. A mother who used her daughter for personal gain, a son who hated his father, and a daughter who was self centered she lacked any morals at all. The book was too contrived to finish. I don't recommend this book to anyone."
2,So disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I have read several of Cheryl Holts books and for the most part enjoyed them. Like most people who read romance novels I enjoy the love scenes, however, there were no love scenes in this book. There were plenty of sex scenes but most of them dealt with degradation of the female and several times they talke about rape and included a scene where an old man ties up a young girl (you don't like her but still..) and rapes her. Even the main characters have sex basically for sex's sake. Not until the end of the book do they even talk about love. I wish I would have just quit reading when I was tempted to in the second chapter."
3,They shrink.,"Nice material, soft inside, nice fit but they shrink considerably. Sooo, I plan to buy a larger size next time. I normally wear a medium but next order will be a large. I would recommend this sweatshirt because (1) Price and (2) Color variety."
4,"A flaming, four star package of irresistible moods.","Though, this is very different from her acoustic debut, Griffin still flourishes in this louder and engulfing record. While the title track and a couple of others, don't really showcase this brilliant songwriter; it's songs like ""One Big Love,"" ""Blue Sky"" and ""Christina,"" that have Top 40 written all over them. Others like ""Wiggley Fingers,"" which moves about all it's own, and the country-tinged ""Goodbye,"" totally solidified my belief that Patty Griffin is that true gem still waiting to be discovered. Seriously. It still suprises me how she has slipped through the consciousness of American radio. Flaming Red is the boiling point at where Griffin rises to the top and spills over. We hope."
5,Wow!!!,"I bought this tape because I loved the song ""Change"" and I have not been disappointed! Every song on this album is both powerful and beautifully sung. Patty Griffin shows not only range as an artist, but as a person. I was simply blown away by the power of this album and highly recommend it to anyone!"
4,A must-have for Patty fans,"For a long time this was the Patty CD I listened to the least, but now it's become my favorite one to listen to over and over again. It's also so different from the others that it's really the only way you'll hear Patty rock out, since she doesn't usually travel with a rock band."
3,Kick ass!,"At first listen, I didn't love this CD as much as the accoustic Living With Ghosts. But after a while, it has grown to become one of my favorite CDs. Patty rocks out hard without losing the desperation & passion in her voice and her lyrics. Tony - I get a lump in my throat when I hear it, yet I belt it out as loud as I can when I'm listening to it. I can't recommend this CD enough."
4,Another great release from a woman with great talent.,A beautiful voice and amazing songs. Go buy it.
5,Patty's best CD (except for the unreleased Silver Bell),"What a shame that Interscope decided not to release Silver Bell, Patty's best album, and probably the best album of the past 10 years. This one is almost as good and better than most anything out there."
5,Great album from a very talented artist,"I recently downloaded a fan-made music video which used Patty Griffin's song ""Mary"". That particular song so beautiful, it almost made me cry. I decided to do a little research on Patty Griffin here at Amazon and find out which album that song was on. The reviews on all of her albums were really great, so I purchased 3 of her albums. Three! I never do that. So far, I'm not disappointed. It seems like it's getting harder to find artists who have a talent for writing meaningful lyrics AND composing great melodies. Flaming Red is an awesome album. Flaming Red, Blue Skies, Goodbye, Cristina, and of course Mary are my favorites, but I don't think there's a ""weak"" song on the entire album. Can't wait to listen to the next one!"
4,A new Patty Fan,"I had never seen or heard of Patty Griffin until I saw her on ""Sessions at 54th"" on PBS the othe night. I was immediately blown away by her performance. Her songs were immediately likeable and I went out and bought ""Flaming Red"" the next day. The title track just rocks, and the haunting ""Peter Pan"" gives me goose bumps. There are some forgettable songs on this CD, but overall, I am so glad that I have discovered this amazing woman. Can't wait to hear her other cd's."
4,Patty evolves,"I'm in a band that (for awhile) covered ""Lorraine"" from LIVING WITH GHOSTS. I rank that record in my top 10 of all time. I bought FLAMING RED out of respect, not knowing what to expect. What I've learned is that this artist takes risks. Before I leave the house I listen to ""Blue Sky"" as loud as I can. My body and soul responds to her music. The lyrics, her emotion, the story and the musical feel really work together to create a unique presentation. I'm sure her next album will disappoint and enchant in equal measure. That's what happens when you write from your core and not for the store."
4,You can't lose when you're a winner,"What kills me about people with good hair is that they go and get some radical haircut, and their hair still looks good; they grow their hair out and it still looks good; they shave their heads bald and, miraculously, they have the perfect head. Patty dosen't look that much different with an electric guitar and a high-strung band. She was always that intense and now she's got a different way of prooving it. She could rap her lyrics and have Barry Manilow as a back up singer with support from the Mays Chapel choir, and her voice would still come through. She's a winner. And I believe she's proven it with this suppurb, new album. Don't listen to it once, you will only hear yourself asking questions. This is a three or four time listen. You will get used to the new style."
4,Go With The Flow,"This album goes down as one of the most criminally overlooked records of the last few years. Many of her own fans haven't helped her cause by critizing her diversity and range of material, which in my opinion makes her a truly great artist. If she had made another album like ""Living With Ghosts"" she would have been critizied for it sounding just like the first. Get over your need for labels and think outside the box. Flaming Red is on FIRE."
4,Patty Griffin evolves and succeeds,"If you own Patty Griffin's debut ""Living With Ghosts"" be warned that ""Flaming Red"" is quite a different creation all together. While her first album is an intimate acoustic collection of emotionally intense songs, ""Flaming Red"" showcases an entire band and an electric take on newer songs. Patty's soul is still on the table in the album, it's just a different take on the production and arrangement. I love this album, especially the heart-breaking ""Goodbye"" and the amazing ""Blue Sky,"" but I think her first album will always be my favorite because of its unique intimacy."
4,Stunning,"I had heard Bette Midler do MARY in her last concert tour and I thought it was the most beautiful song I'd ever heard. I know Bette's recording it, but I started trying to find out info on the song's origin, and found out about Patty Griffin. I've now played this CD to death - I'm not too crazy about the hystrionic guitars and such, but I do know I've found another chanteuse to enjoy."
5,one of a kind,This is one of those albums that changed my life and made me a Patty fan forever. I now have all of her cd's (and i love them all) but this one is the most special to me- raw and emotive and brilliant.
2,"Completely different than ""living with ghosts""","I bought ""Flaming Red"" unheard because I absolutely love ""Living With Ghosts"". After playing it, I double checked the CD case to be sure I bought the right artist. I miss the calmer emotion from the first album. This one was too loud and not at all what I expected."
3,"Great songs, stupid production","Flaming Red is a bunch of good songs struggling desperately to escape from unfortunate post-Alanis kitchen-sink production and over-modulation. Some make it, many don't.Griffin has a lovely voice, but it is too often reduced to a screech here as it competes with layers of guitar and general sonic hyperactivity. Of the full-on songs only the bouncy summer tune ""One Big Love"" really survives this treatment intact. The disc concludes with a group of quieter tunes, including the standout ""Mary"", but the clustering of these at the end of the disc gives the whole thing an unfinished quality."
2,Who is this?,"I first heard Patty Griffin singing on the album ""1000 kisses"". Since Ive heard more from this talented singer, and liked what I heard. However, when I put on this disc, I acually had to check and see if I had put in the wrong disc. This album is much louder, with heavy guitars, and an aggressive approach to the songs. That mighyt be OK for some, but I prefer the acoustic type-country flavored songs Ive heard from Griffin. Im all for artists not doing the same thing over again, but this disc just doesnt sit well with me. I like having Griffins voice as the main focus of her songs, and on this disc you dont get that."
1,GHOSTS ARE BETTER,It's a shame that she had to go electric... her first album was so great and now it's a nosedive.
5,Excellent Introductory Book,I needed to refreshen my knowledge of economics after taking a year or Macro and Micro economics courses. This is book is perfect for those who want fundamental understanding of economics with a balanced point of view. I could not put it down and finished it in about 5-6 hrs. Good book.
4,A good economics book.,I have used this as a class text for university freshman economics. I like it as a no standard nonmathematical text however I do think that the material does need to be supplemented in lecture with a few more graphs and such.
4,"Fun, informative, and no so Freakonomicsy",Enjoyed the book. An enjoyable read that was required for my econ 110 class. No graphs = a pleasure.
5,Perfect for someone looking to understand Economics without the math,"I am someone who took a basic Econ class in school. Found the math involved cumbersome and the way the subject handled quite boring. So you can guess I never took another Econ class.Saw the amazing reviews on Amazon and purchased this one and boy ! am I glad I made this purchase. This one's a keeper.Mr. Wheelan, thanks for writing the book so simplistically , yet without missing any imp points. I think this book is a must read for everyone just to gain a basic understanding of how the different things in our daily lives are governed by Economic principles.Interest rates / Stocks / Bonds/ Trade / Currency / Inflation..... I can go on and on.Thing is, if you feel confused about Economics and need an overview without the charts and math. This is the book to read.The writing is clear , funny :) and makes it's point using some really great examples.Worth every penny !!!!"
1,OMG!,"This book should be used for nothing more than a popular-definition economics dictionary/paper weight. It's deceitfully clever, and fundamental wrong, wrong, wrong, in so many ways I don't even know where to start. Free trade, the best of ALL possible worlds; the glorious benefits of NAFTA; the WTO our benevolent, selfless, economic overseer. I urge you to read, or at least read the Amazon reviews of ""Free trade doesn't work what should replace it and why"". Amazon only has one copy left so you'd better hurry, the truth is in limited supply."
1,Village Idiot,"This guy thinks it is a good idea for our government to tax everything that has to do with carbon dioxide. We exhale carbon dioxide every time we exhale a breath of air. Global Warming is occuring on Mars. Does that mean that our pollution has affected Mars? lol It will destroy our economy. Why would you want to raise taxes when businesses are already struggling? And if he does not grasp this simple common sense policy, then why would you buy this brain dead authors book?"
3,Too high-level for the conclusions it tries to draw,"First of all, Wheelan forced his class to buy his book, which is always annoying, although I like him as a person otherwise. People compare this to Freakonomics but Wheelan, who used to write for the Economist, is less engaging than his competition. Secondly, this is not a book to be using for a 2nd or 3rd year economics course, especially not at a university renowned for its economics and public policy departments. I ended up giving mine to a high school aged cousin, who found it to be a good overview but commented that he wasn't really sure why he should be accepting the prescriptions offered and left wondering if there were alternatives (which he framed in terms of opportunity cost so I guess it did the job there)."
5,simple text that everyone can understand,"I picked this book out of the bookshelf in a public library, purely by chance, yet got fascinated by it. It explains basic economic idea in the context of public policy making process. I think this is a basic book that everyone should read. Read this this and then discuss whatever politics you want. Public policy fails all the time if it does not comform to the market force."
5,Easy and informative,"If you think economics is a mysterious or unapproachable subject, I believe you'll find that the author is able to introduce, explain and illustrate many economic principles without jargon or complex terminology. After I read it I found myself noticing more how economics shapes our world. And I wanted to learn more about economics, and have in fact read more, including New Ideas from Dead Economists."
5,YUP!,"Great service, came in about a week. But, this book was super boring but that's what you get for reading about economics!"
5,excellent read,i highly recommend this title for anyone interested in economics-- from the individual who completely lacks an economics background to someone who already has a strong grasp of the science.
4,More liberals should read it.,"Overall I thought some of the analysis was incorrect as the author allows for government intervention more than is logically (or empirically) necessary. Overall it is a good book, but not as good as Free to Choose, Basic Economics, or Economics in One Lesson. Nevertheless, I wish more liberals read the book so they can learn about positive side about free markets."
3,so-so,"easy concepts, lots of everyday examples. but it's not a 'you-must-read-this-thing-sometime-before-you-die' type of book. why was this book required, i don't know."
3,Bought because of college book,"Bought this because of my college book report (yeah, I know right?). It's pretty funny but it's very redundant. And most of the stuff is pretty self explanatory. Meh."
5,Great Book,This book provides insight and entertainment into the world of economics. I highly reccommend this book to anyone with a heartbeat because economics a huge part of everyday life.
3,A disingenuous after-the-fact revision to explain away the events of 2008,"The original version of this book was written before the events of 2008. While I enjoyed it at the time, after 2008, I felt it was discredited due to the author's excessive fawning over Greenspan, and espousing many policies that were found to be an abject failure and the cause of the financial meltdown. Now that 2008 happened, the author has found it necessary to present an after-the-fact correction to the original book and explanation. I find that disingenuous. If the original edition had held up better, I would have considered buying this edition too."
4,Great book,"This is a good book on basic economics. He helps you understand certain topics easily. He is slanted, politically, so I had to fight to understand some of the thoughts. I have had others borrow the book and they said they enjoyed the book as well."
5,Want to Learn and Have Fun? Read This Book!,"Wow! Wheelan has a rare gift for taking a typically dry topic (in this case, economics) and making it lively, interesting, and often quite funny. Yes, there is an ideological perspective underlying the ideas in the book, but this perspective is itself an important feature of contemporary economic thinking (at least the thinking that's been most influential). Wheelan is a true teacher. And whether you agree with the book's perspective or not, you will come away much better informed and, in all likelihood, feeling entertained as well. Thank you, Mr. Wheelan, for helping me appreciate more fully the power of trade. I now see more clearly that it's not a zero-sum world out there, economically speaking. I'm not about to start voting Republican, but you've changed my mind about a few things! (I'm not assuming Wheelan himself is a Republican, by the way, but the ideas in the book are surely more Republican-like than Democrat-like.)"
5,Economics??,"I think the title is a little misleading, whether you are interested in economics or not, this is a fascinating book. I would recommend it to people who have no interest in economics. I read it in one sitting, the highest compliment I can give any book."
3,Great for Beginners!,"I purchased this book as a gift for a friend.His feedback has been revealing, as the author touches on subjects with flair and simplicity, ideal for beginners!"
1,Poorly Made,"I bought this outdoor sconce a year and 3 months ago, It looks nice, but that's where it ends, its VERY poorly made. They used a plastic casing to house the bulb, which is probably not a good idea for an outdoor fixture. The top of the housing has completely rotted, and literally, crumbled away. The side of the housing is also cracking and crumbling. I have been using a CFL bulb (the housing is CFL approved), and am well within the wattage specs on their instruction sheet. Also, the plastic sheet that sits between the satin nickel face and the bulb has also cracked. I contacted PLC and even sent them pictures of the defect, and they refuse to send me a replacement plastic housing unit, which would probably cost their company pennies. The cost and quality of this product don't match up. Do yourself a favor and avoid overspending on PLC's poorly made products."
2,Musette from Des Moines,"If you're looking for some ambiance music for your French restaurant in Iowa (especially if you have french fries on the menu), then this is the CD for you. With no recognizable artists, certainly not the ones who made these songs famous, this music is probably best as background to a loud conversation. Truly, this CD is about as close to Paris as Wonder bread is to a baguette."
4,A longer tale for Omar,"Standard Dave Duncan in that this is a fun, very readable fantasy with agreeable, intelligent characters. The Reaver Road is one of two books featuring Omar the Storyteller (also see The Hunter's Haunt). In this case, one long story about Omar and his chance companion Thorian being caught up in an intrigue of war, gods, treachery, and lust. The players act (sort of) as real people might, and are characteristically upbeat and optimistic. All in all, a lighthearted bit of fun in much the same enjoyable vein as most other Duncan books."
4,Highly entertaining!,"Far superior to what I've read of the seemingly endless series work that Duncan has done, here he gives a laudable contribution to the lighthearted subgenre of fantasy (in the style of Fritz Leiber, L. Sprague de Camp, and Robert E. Vardeman). Thus, there are many amusing tongue-in-cheek adventures. Thoroughly entertaining protagonists and settings make for a worthy diversion over two or three evenings. A curious feature of the story, that I couldn't help but notice, however, is that the two protagonists apparently are naked throughout fully half of the book!!! 8.5hrs"
4,Good.,"An excellent novel, another fine piece of work from Mr. Duncan. A well written book with believable characters."
3,A book for beginners,"This is not a book for someone who already knows a lot about Uzbekistan. Melvin is a 'nationalities' expert who has no evident background in Uzbek or the Uzbeks, so there is little in the way of in-depth analysis. If you are just looking to get a general review of Uzbekistan, this may be the book for you - at only 123 pages in paperback, it won't take long to get through. It's generally pretty readable, except for the occasional run-on sentance. You also need to beware of some sloppy editing that misidentifies dates and people. The book is primarily about politics, not culture, so if you are looking for something on history, culture, or religion, I suggest that you keep looking."
4,Good album.,"Good album, well worth listening too.Brings back the nostalgia associted with the Sixties.Writing these words to reach twenty...."
4,A Particular Genre,This cookbook is fun and a historical look at our cooking past. There are ideas to be found for our present society. It is an excellent source when trying to reproduce an era of greater elegance.
5,The Best Southern cookbook.,This is The best Southern cookbook. The menus and recipesare invaluable. Celia Marks work is a classic. It's a wonderful gift fora new cook or any experienced cook who doesn't have it already.
3,Horror 101,"Horror 101 is definately a classic independent film with a good plot, good acting, a good mystery, and an overall good job.The film takes place with eight students taking a course on fear. They come for the final exam but the teacher never shows up. Then the lights go out. As the eight peers walk down the dark halls of the building they begin to mysteriously dissapear. The film is a classic because there is barely any gore and it's not a slasher film. It's all purely suspense."
4,Very Good!,"All of the episodes on this DVD are fine, especially the surreal ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit."" ""Ninety Years without Slumbering"" is a charming script, even if the ending is a little weak. Ed Wynn is superb throughout as an elderly gentleman who suffers from a delusion involving an heirloom grandfather clock. I wouldn't want to reveal the endings of any of the episodes, so you'll just have to trust me that they are three good ones. In short, you can't go wrong with this DVD."
4,I watched this series when I was younger...,"and still like it now. It was the groundbreaking series for the ""thinking"" type series. It made you think at the end of the episode."
5,Your devoted #1 Fan,I found that the character of Dr. Allan Smith played by Robert Strouse could have been better utilized throughout the film. The lack of this character could have seriously jeopardized the film. All in all a good film and I look forward to seeing actor Robert Strouse in future roles. I highly recommend this film to horror buffs everywhere.
4,soul-touching piano pieces,"for a non-classically minded music aficionado like myself, this is a beautiful introduction to the magic of the keys.after getting initially smitten with the more popular pieces ofBeethoven and Mozart, I had the chance to experience the beauty and power of Schumann, Tchaikovsky, Schubert and Grieg.The magic ride begins with the first piece by Sinding (whom I hadnever heard of), and stays till the end."
2,Hugh Dancy saves the movie,"This movie was really bad. The story seemed to be thrown together. The dialogue was not believable. The characters were underdeveloped. Melanie Griffith was terrible, Rachel Leigh Cook was terrible. The only worthwhile quality this movie had can be summed up in three little words: Hugh Dancy Naked. He's the most believable actor in this movie. He really does all a person can do with such awful dialogue, but this isn't his best performance. If you're not a Hugh Dancy fan, don't waste your time with this movie."
2,TEMPO SKIPS A BEAT,"In this derivative, limp made for Canadian TV movie, Melanie Griffith stumbled through the role of a glitzy ""courier"" for obviously illegal products. She has a younger live-in stud (Hugh Dancy in a weak performance) and is sent on a secretive mission by Malcolm McDowell (he pops up in almost anything these days). Melanie also has a sleazy additional boss (played with absent malice by Art Malik) who screws up the McDowell deal and then demands eighty thousand dollars for the effort. Along comes lovely Rachael Leigh Cook (who deserves better than this) who suddenly becomes the true love of Dancy's miserable life. Dancy is such a spineless cad one can hardly feel sympathy for the miss the three of them end up in. It's all been done before and much much better. TEMPO is a composition without any heart."
2,2 Stars Merely for Mr. Dancy,"This movie is so weak I can barely explain how it has damaged me. It seems to rest somewhere between mainstream and indie styles, but in either genre it is a hollow movie. The only good thing about this movie is Hugh Dancy. I love him as an actor (and it doesn't hurt that he's attractive), but I am horribly disappointed in his choice to participate in this film. Bad Hugh. Slap on the wrist and let's all move on, okay? If you need me I'll be in my room, crouched in the fetal position and whimpering softly to myself. Need.....developed.....script.....NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"
1,Don't buy this,"I don't care what your type of movie is, I don't see how you will like this. These actors must have been desperate for money to make such a lame film. I gave it one star for landing such a well known cast in such a horrid film."
1,this movie is not up to speed,"An interesting, but predictable twist centers this film. The three big name stars that are in this film - Melanie Griffith, Rachael Leigh Cook, and Hugh Dancy - all act mediocre in this film. Hugh Dancy is charming, and even shows off his rear behind in a shower scene, which should be enough to get his fangirls to see this film."
3,Dawn Explosion,"Dawn ExplosionLike they say, not as good as the finefirst album, but an improvement over Sufficiently Breathless. Saw thislineup in '77 or '78, great show. Man, I'm old, can't believe it's been thirtyyears!"
4,Very good try to recapture the essence.,"Lee Dorman's songwriting is Captain Beyond and his bass lines are funky, economical and tasty. Bobby Caldwell delivers the goods,as always, and Rhino has got to be the most underrated guitarist on the planet (his solos are the most emotional since Hendrix). Given the time frame of the album release, this band in its' current lineup was the least powerful, but still packed more punch than alot of current bands in the prog-rock genre. This album grows on you. Highly recommended."
1,"dawn Explosion, Capt. Beyond","Bad, Bad, Bad,... Save your money , nothing at all like their first two albums. Just a bunch of sleeping material all put together to sell an album.. I will never listen to it again. It is worthless..."
4,Return,"The third Captain Beyond album comes back to the format the band used on their debut, though not so successfully; they are back as a trio with a vocalist, without the keyboards and latin percussion section. ""If You Please"" sounds like something from Sufficiently Breathless and ""Midnight Memories"" is a throwaway (except for its unusual chord progression), but the rest of the album rocks, though not like their first album. ""Breath of Fire, Part 1"" kicks serious ass, but the highlight is ""Fantasy,"" which is on the same level as ""Dancing Madly Backward"" or ""Mesmerization Eclipse"" from the first record. Overall, this is serious hard rock, highly recommended."
2,Dawn Explosion has it's moments,"The last and best song on the album is Oblivion, an appropriately named instrumental that is the last time we hear from Rhino, Dorman, and Caldwell - three awsome muscians who's talents shine in albums one and two. Unfortunately, Dawn Explosion most often misses the energy and creativity of the first two albums. Oblivion...an appropriate name for their wherabouts... until 1999!!!! Rhino,( now Ryno) and Caldwell are back with a new Captain Beyond band, currently beginning a tour in Europe, with rumors of an album to be released this year!!"
3,For die-hard fans only,"This, the 3rd CB album, doesn't come close to their debut self-titled MASTERPIECE. But there are still moments when that old CB magic emerges. For example, the background guitars build in the same manner prior to the solo in both DANCING MADLY BACKWARDS & ICARUS. Highpoints: DO OR DIE, ICARUS, ALONE IN THE COSMOS. Bobby Caldwell doesn't kick butt like he did on the debut, & W. Daffern is a very different vocalist than Rod Evans. In general, it sounds like the songs weren't as fully realized. There's more of a pop, rather than a purely hard rock feel."
3,missing important stuff,"the most important and seeked sections in a daily newspaper for american men is the standings of their favorite teams and to some, the daily and weekly betting lines. either the kindle version of the chronicle does not have this or i cannot find it."
2,No National Content,"We are current subscribers to the print edition of the newspaper, and were excited to switch to getting the paper on our new Kindle for the ease of use and the reduction of paper trash. However, we cancelled our trial subscription after 2 days due to a general lack of content. We're sticking with the print edition.When comparing the Kindle version and the print version, one can see that the only articles in the Kindle version are the ones written by the Houston Chronicle writers. That makes sense, but without the Associated Press content and content from other papers around the country it translates to a tiny fraction of the print edition. We had no idea that the Chron produced so little original content outside of the sports section.We liked the layout, formatting, and ease of use of the Kindle version. However, it is only for local news and sports (and only some of that). I would only recommend subscribing if you don't mind getting your national news elsewhere."
4,Very good value for the price,"I don't understand all the negativity towards the Kindle edition of the Houston Chronicle. Sure, it doesn't have EVERY article, but then again, you're not paying full paper subscription price for it either. It has all the most important articles and I don't feel that there's that much missing out of this."
4,Nice Paper,"As a long time subscriber before we moved to NYC from Houston, I really enjoyed this paper. Their coverage of Houston, Texas and the Southwest is excellent, The sports section is good too, especially if you like Big 12 sports. My main knock of the paper is their reliance on writers from other papers for stories that are beyond the Texas border."
1,Lacks content,Where is the rest of the paper? Not worth the subscription cost just yet. No ads is nice though.
3,Needs more content,"I signed up for the Houston Chronicle but cancelled within the first 14 days due to a general lack of content. To me it felt like we were getting less than half the paper. I wanted to read the tech columns etc. but during my brief subscription I did not see Silverman's column included in the Kindle version nor did I see national syndicated columns. I may give them a month or two and try again because I like the idea of having a newpaper on my Kindle.Update: Feb 14, 2009, just bought another copy to see if there was any improvement. Sadly, no. Please Houston Chron give us full content...including pictures, comics, technology articles, etc."
1,Very little covered. Not worth it!,I ordered the Houston Chronicle sample with my new Kindle and was very disappointed. It had only a very few articles from the paper. I know the paper is getting thinner but this is ridiculous.I won't subscribe until they get more content!
2,No associated press content,"There is a LOT missing from this paper.It gives most of the local news and the sports, but lacks national and world news. As discussed in the other reviews, there are no syndicated columns, comics, or photos. However, it goes deeper than that. This version of the paper only includes content written directly by the Chron staff. Unfortunately, what that means is while local news is adequately covered, national and world news is not covered in any detail and Texas news is covered somewhat haphazardly.I've had the paper for about a week now. On the typical day, there are anywhere between 1 and 3 articles each in the National and World news sections. And these generally do not cover the major events; they just cover what national events that the Chron staff has given their own spin to.While good for local events, you'll need a separate paper for national and world news."
2,It's Better Then Nothing,I purchased my Kindle just for reading papers and blogs. I live in Houston and was happy to see the Houston paper. I was depressed to see that most of the paper is left out. I think Amazon should make all the papers include ALL their content if they want to sell via Kindle. How hard can it be? I will keep my subscription for a while and hope it gets better...
1,Poorly edited,"I agree with other reviewers when they say that the Kindle edition of the Houston Chronicle is not worth it. It is worth comparing it to the printed edition side-by-side. It is amazing how severely the Kindle edition has been abridged. The editor seems to have the judgment of a beginning apprentice. Other regional papers do it much better; for instance, the Minneapolis paper is almost worth the subscription.Navigation remains an area that needs to be improved in these Kindle newspapers."
2,Paper version better,I agree with the other reviewers that a lot of the content I want is missing from the kindle version. I'll cancel after the 2week trial and try a single issue every once in a while to see if the content improves.
1,just go to mobile,The Kindle edition is seriously lacking in content. Not worth the price. Just do as I do and bookmark the URL of mobile.chron.com in your Kindle's web browser. The mobile format web page works great on the Kindle and it's FREE with much more content! Cheers!
1,Lacks Content,You might get all stories on the front page or just one. The remainder of the sectional content is just as hit or miss.
2,No Energy News Sectiion,I regularly read the Chronicle online even though I'm from Atlanta because of their Energy news section. I would gladly pay for access on Kindle to this content were it provided. Who knows - maybe they'll wise up soon and include...
2,Not for the serious news reader,"This is the second time I've tried the Houston Chronicle on the Kindle. I canceled the first time due to lack of news content. I thought they made changes and tried again. Still, it has not changed in that regard. The consistent clear winner in content is the sports section. Business is a distant second. So when it comes to local, national, or international news, a lot is left to be desired. Even if Reader's Digest were to do a version of the Houston Chronicle, it'd have more depth that what is published for a Kindle. I'm waiting to read reviews where this serious shortcoming has been corrected."
1,unhappy subscriber,"After 30+ years of The Chronicle I find myself out of the delivery zone and tried the Kindle version. I find the Chronicle on Kindle has too many errors and is way short of useful info. Articles do not match the headlines, paragrapghs are repeated--sometimes whole articles are repeated under different headers, incorrect hyphenation, isolated characters and inappropriate symbles all make it difficult to read. It gives the horoscopes and lottery results but not the sports scores or the Dow Jones averages. Then of course--no comics! Such a great idea but it comes up short!"
3,Houston Chronicle Sports Section lacking,The Sports Section is lacking in content. I always scan box scores and standings. Both are missing on the Kindle version of the Houston Chronicle.
4,Better than I thought it would be.,"As a new Kindle user I just subscribed to the electronic Houston Chronicle and have been very pleased. The content follows the hard copy very closely as I compared them for the last two days. While I miss some columns, I can find them on the internet if I suffer withdrawal. Also, I will not miss the $25 I was paying each month."
1,Where's the Beef?,"Very little content mars this electronic version of the Houston Chronicle. Of course, the Sports section is larger than any of the others... almost combined. More news please."
1,No Content - only synchs to one kindle,"Is it any wonder that Hearst reported is looking at closing down the SF Chron. They need to move to the modern age.I will not order the print paper as it is just too much paper waste a month and was excited to see that it was available for the kindle. I then went through it and there was no Content in the Paper. Not even a single article on the Presidents address the previous night. Then I find out that it will go to one kindle so I would have to order 2 copies on for myself and one for my wife.If all of the articles were available I would love to get this without the paper waste, but as it stands this is just digital waste.Wake-up Hearst and look to the new generation and what we will purchase. I would gladly pay for a complete digital local paper, and even like to upgrade to have access to articles from all the Hearst papers."
4,Who done it,"This book was a good read. Mysterious, full of intrigue and a fun story. Jesse Grant is a reporter who won't quit until she gets to the bottom of the story. She mees the smart, handsome Cole Nicholson and also becomes entangled in a mystery of who killed a friend. Jesse and Cole find a way to get through this ordeal to let their love connect. Great read."
4,Good Romantic Mystery,"Jesse Grant, burned by a very bad relationship, tries to find a new life in Silicon Valley. But what she really finds is a mystery to solve. A friend is murdered, and Jesse's jounalistic instinct kicks in and she searches for the truth behind the friend's mysterious death. In the mean time, she gets caught up in Cole Nicholson's dangerous passion.Know By Heart is a romantic mystery that keeps the reader anticipating the next twist in the plot."
3,Interesting biography of pioneer physique photographer,"A biography of one of the pioneer physique photographers of the 1940s-1960s. Contains a number of photos of the photographer and his models. Readers may also want to look at Kouros, a collection of Barrington's photographic work."
5,What are you made of?,"Asimov does a good job describing the process of the human body's in take and use of chemicals. From the air we breath, the food we eat, the effect of sun on our skin (making Vitamin D) and many more. Step by step explaination. Some with diagram. All simplified and in a language a non-medical person can understand."
5,Awesome Lotion!,This stuff is amazing. Not greasy at all. Love the smell and the texture. HIGHLY recommended!
5,A cool movie with the coolest man in it,"I have seen 'Out Of Sight'at least 3 times and I enjoyed a lot every time.It's a great,unique film first of all because of it's characters.But thanks to Steven Soderberg the dialogue,the music,and the places are also memorable and special.I was obsessed by George Clooney.Playing Jack,he showed another side of his attraction,a most enchanting and passionate one.I bet that those who're fans of George will adore him more after this movie.Also,the love scene in the bar was almost the most beautiful one I've seen this far.Unforgetable and impressive!"
2,Jennifer lopez is a great actress. George stay TV. please,Jennifer is verstaile in her acting.i hope i get to see her in other roles..Out of Sight was good to see her and George Clooney..I really like that Micheal Keaton touch too. But George Clooney should stick to E.R..
3,"Great DVD, Poor Title","Out of Sight, with George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez, is an average crime-like thriller with some relatively forced comedic elements.I won't go into the plot or story content too much - I found it very implausible and most of the ""fun"" parts were overkilled during their publicity blitz - but instead I'll head into the DVD contents for fans already familiar with the movie.The DVD quality was excellent, with solid blacks and fantastic sound. It was jam-packed with extras, typical of this studio's ""Collectors Edition"" releases. Regardless of the film's contents this is almost a showpiece DVD - the type you want to display for your non-DVD owning friends because of the quality and transfer.Extras are all top-notch, with great selection menus and a variety of subtitles. Other people I watched the DVD with were impressed with the story and content, so it's a mixed bag."
2,Watch At Your Own Risk,I did not like the film. The believability of it just wasn't there. I did not understand Jennifer Lopez's character. The film was cute at certain moments but not worth the money. See more at [...].
3,Out of Sight,"Interesting and a little exciting but not at all realistic - seemed too contrived with obvious intent to ""sell it""."
5,Steven Soderbergh & Elmore Leonard,"Steven Soderbergh is one of my favorite film directors. He directed Ocean's Eleven, Sex, Lies and Videotape, Erin Brockovich, Traffic, and my favorite: Che. Out of Sight is his first film based on an Elmore Leonard novel. George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez are the leading actors. The plot is complex, but all the supporting actors (Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, Dennis Farino and Albert Brooks) add depth to the plot line. Out of Sight looks great in blu-ray."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!,"This was an over-hyped, anticlimactic movie with great actors and characters, but a glacial, and unsuspenseful pace of direction. The action was minimal, the scenes too long, and the theatrical trailer was no where to be found on the DVD! Believe me, Get Shorty was 3 times as good,and if you want a great crime caper, see L.A.Confidential. Otherwise, don't bother with Out of Sight. I can't believe I bought this."
2,"Bad Version of ""Pulp Fiction""","This movie was a bad version of ""Pulp Fiction"" with a lot less action and with a lot more bad acting!!"
2,Uneven and Boring,"Good cast wasted on unlikable characters. The confused plot loses so much energy along the way, that it almost grinds to a stop by the third act. Love angle stretches credibility. The film's resolution unsatisfying."
2,Flashbacks made it difficult to follow the story line...,"As a George Clooney fan, of Dust to Dawn, Peacemaker, and One Fine Day, this supposed comedy fell short of my expectations. Even though I felt there was a sexual attraction between Clooney and Jennifer Lopez I felt the rest of the characters had poor definition and development which contributed to a tedious plot developed by flashbacks"
1,The worst movie I ever saw,"As titled above, this movie was awful. The relationship between Clooney and Lopez was phoney and totally unbelievable. I could have cared less if either one was blown off the screen. The premise is stupid. I can't believe it received good reviews."
1,terrible movie,"This movie suffers from bad acting, lack of character development, and an insipid plot.C'mon - Jennifer Lopez a federal matshall? Then George Clooney is always George Clooney - nice looking but he's the Frank Sinatra of modern cinema - he never gets beyond who he is.Then there is the plot - which didn't even rate as high as typical sitcom crime story. Sure, the characters almost kill each other and then they fall in love. Right. Happens all the time.I can't believe that Soderbergh made this after King of the Hill, which was a very beautiful movie. Making this must have been to pay some bills or some debts or something that would make him do something totally stupid.At best it is a good example of how Hollywood takes insightful, original, talented filmmakers and gets them to make the typical trash movie, completely comprising their integrity."
3,George Clooney could do better,"No wonder this film bombed at the box office---it's not that good. Jennifer Lopez was far better in ""Selena""."
1,Boring and shallow...,"I don't how this movie got **** so far. It's so boring, full of endless and meaningless talk (meant to be cool? come on!)How is George's performance? No comment. But he sure chose a wrong role."
5,George's star is rising fast!,"I loved this movie. George Clooney is so great as Jack Foley--if you are a Clooney fan, you will love it too. Jennifer Lopez and Ving Rhames also give great performances. If you have read the book by Elmore Leonard, you will be happy to know that the movie sticks very close to the story. Final analysis: Truly a must-see."
3,The movie lacks something...,"The cast is attractive. The leads have chemistry. The trunk scene is hot. I usually like this type of movies. However, there is something missing. Perhaps no main character was in any particular danger. There appears to be very little at stake. This is a clever movie, enjoyable but not a required viewing for movie buffs."
3,"An interesting tale, marred by excessive profanity.","A good plot (with likable characters) and superior acting make this a film worth seeing (not just because Elmore Leonard and Scott Frank supply the two literary bases). But why did Soderberg choose to make it foul-mouthed (?), because if it weren't it would simply carry its R rating for violence. The story is the cliche of a thief falling in love with a federal marshall, but it is inventive and funny."
4,Jennifer Lopez should have won an award for this one...,"Jennifer Lopez is a HOTTIE! Oh, by the way, her ACTING should not have won an award, but her body...it's so great :) It's a very interesting movie which is part of an unofficial trilogy (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and Out of Sight). George Clooney ain't that bad and the film was very straight-forward on it's point. Ving Rhames is a great actor and should star in a whole lot more movies. Not a bad deal for the price it's asking for! :)"
2,Not very impressive,"Yeah. The movie plot is very 'shallow'. No exciting whatsoever. When I watched it, I tried to feel appreciate like people who bought this movie before me. BUT IT IS NOT THERE. I especially hate the ending because I don't understand. It is like it needs your self-imagination to end it. This is not really the purpose for me to invest on this movie. Or probably too high level for me to get it. Ask me if it is worth for this price. No way. I rate 2 stars for they get good actor (actress). The story is poor (say it one more time)."
4,Out of Sight - A Fun Watch,"Here's a fun, entertaining crime/comedy that's sure to have you jumping and laughing. George Clooney, a pro-bank robber named Jack Foley, gets caught when his old car breaks down in the parking-lot of a bank. Jack gets sent to jail, and from that sparks a wild adventure of avoiding the cops and other criminals. This flick is highly enjoyable...has some drawn-out romance with Clooney and Jennifer Lopez - whether or not that's a good thing or a bad thing, you can decide on your own. If you liked Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction, or Jackie Brown, I bet you'll like this one, too. Based on the Elmore Leonard novel.OUT OF SIGHT is rated R for violence, a scene of gore, language, and some sexualtiy."
3,This was a slow-paced movie.,"The movie was excellent, but I didn't like how it kept switching back and forth from 2 years ago, to Jennifer Lopez's daydreams. I never quite knew where I was. It was very funny, though."
4,"Out of Sight, not out of mind","I should preface this by saying that I am by no means old, so I don't mean to come off as snotty when I describe this film. But this is a movie I would not have liked when I was younger and had less patience for a film. But as time goes by I seem to be able to better appreciate movies that take their time developing the relationships with the characters. This is a fairly slow moving tale, but I do not mean that as a negative. I very much enjoyed the leisurely pace and in the end appreciated how everything unfolded. This is an excellent movie for those of us with patience. Anyone else may be better suited with another title."
4,Incredible Detail,"I had never seen this film, but had read good reviews of it so I thought I'd give it a shot.It was a very entertaining film, but that's secondary to the fact that the picture quality on this HD-DVD is ASTOUNDING. I wasn't expecting too much from a more obscure title like this, but the clarity and detail is top notch.If you are looking for an entertaining ""crook and police officer fall for eachother"" type of film, and you've got an HD-DVD player, you can't go wrong with this title.I found the movie did drag at a few points, which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. In terms of the quality of the presentation and the disc itself, I'd give it 5 stars across the board!"
3,A FUN LOOK BACK,"Purchased the DVD based on an Entertainment Weekly article. It was fun to witness George and Jennifer back in earier times. The plot kept me interested. Was it Oscar worthy?---hell no!!! But an enjoyabe ride, nonetheless."
3,Clooney's Head and Jenn's Body,"I'll start with the pans. That Soderbergh nonlinear storytelling is annoying. If I thought jumbling the time line of the story would make a big difference, okay, but instead, I got a migraine.George Clooney is a handsome face and big heads work on TV screens. You need the rest of the body at the megaplex. I couldn't help but notice that the fellow is kind of squatty when he walks. Bogart was short too, but I knew he was gonna explode on a punk for laughs. Clooney just delivers lines. His body is quiet.Now for the good: Jennifer Lopez is flat out sexy and sultry in this role. I guess every female cop on TV is based on Jenn's late 90's tough chick wearing a mini with a badge. No, it makes no sense, but the guys don't mind.Elmore Leonard's books transfer to the big screen fine. Ya can't beat a good Florida caper flick."
3,A love affair between a crook and a cop,"A slightly banal action film or thriller that does not thrill you too much though. More pathetic than fascinating. A little crook that falls in love and vice versa with the female cop who is after him or manages to be after him. Quite trite. That happens everyday and all the time. It's nearly more interesting to see how this small crook and his crooked black accomplice get nearly fooled and trapped by some other small crooks who are just a little bit more authoritarian if not authoritative, since they don't even check if the man whose house they plan to burglarise is home or not. Our small crook is turning good and manages to get the crooks who tried to fool him down in the clap or directly into some graveyard. But no luck, boy, the cop is a cop and she arrests you just the same with no brownie points. Funny at the most but not explosively hilarious, far from it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
1,I just don't get it!,"I don't know what the big deal was. I watched it twice thinking maybe I missed something. I didn't. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. Too much hoopla... not enough substance."
1,A very poorly done movie that's not worth buying.,"I was very disappointed in the lack of direction in this movie. At times, it seemed to try and be a comedy, then a drama, then an action film. But in the end it was none of these! I was so disgusted with the fact that I had spent the money for this disk, and couldn't return it because I had opened it, that I threw my copy in the garbage can rather than have it take up space in my DVD collection! Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money either"
1,Did I miss something ?,"I'm sorry but I thought this was the most over-rated film of 1998. Every single review I read harked on about how great it was so I convinced about five of my friends to watch it at the cinema with me. I sat there in silence as I realised I had taken them to watch a turkey and that people were walking out in disgust. When it finally finished I was lucky not to be beaten up in the car park by my former friends. In a word, terrible."
2,More of a Silly Comedy/Romance,"Florida bank robber Jack Folely (George Clooney) plays a genteel game of cat-and-mouse with Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) a stunning federal marshal he meets in the trunk of a getaway car. The Director is Steven Soderbergh (Traffic) who inserts freeze-frames, time-shifting, as well as a hip jazzy-soul music soundtrack.The movie is enjoyable and not too bloody or gory. It focuses more on the romance between Jack and Karen as they go through the cops and robbers chase. More than a bit silly."
1,Not impressed.,"Deadpan, dry and bland. I literally fell asleep 20 minutes into it. I then got up and went straight to bed and let my roomate get my money's worth for the rental. This movie got so much hype and even garnished an oscar nomination! Did I miss something? Someone please tell me if I missed something! Selena was a much better movie!"
2,I did not care for this movie,"I found out about this movie, through a wikipedia search tied to Jackie Brown, one of my all time favorite movies(Michael Keaton plays same charecter in both). I ordered it, and watched it the day it arrived. I just thought the plot was thin, and I never became invested in any of the characters. Watch it if it comes on free tv if you want, but do not buy it for a first viewing."
3,"This area is for reviews, not marketing.","Do you think the anonymous viewer from HOLLYWOOD below might possibly have some financial interest in this movie?? I could shout just as loudly not to buy it. Oh yeah, the movie was okay, but predictable. Rent it first."
4,"A fast,furious,fantastic piece of powerful angst!","No other movie, save Get Shorty, has as well captured the essence of grit and steam, heat and vibe that is an Elmore Leonard novel. Long live Out of Sight."
3,it was better than i expected!!,"after seeing from dusk til dawn i discovered that mr.clooney was actually an ok actor.i wasn't a real big fan of ER and i hated BATMAN & ROBIN so i wasn't sure what to think about him.jeniffer lopez is hot!!!!!!i saw her new video on mtv, and its awesome!!!this movie kinda lost me in the middle, but after i watched it again i got it!!!"
4,A really good movie,"This is a well done movie with Jennifer Lopez when she used to be hot, before she became a self-proclaimed diva. George Clooney is a smoothe character as usual and playing the bad guy you can't help but like. Although a lot of the dialogue feels like they're reading right off the script, it's a good plot and has some good roles, with actors that have come up since this movie was made."
5,My favorite movie of 1998!!!,I think this is definitely one of the best movies of '98. I could watch it over and over. I think the chemistry between Clooney and Lopez was the most believable I've seen in a long time. And it was so funny. This was a very well acted and well written movie. I am definitely going to buy it when the price goes down and I know it will be added to the list of movies I can watch over and over. A must see!! Plus the sound track is killer.
4,Clooney tries on the Pulp Fiction persona.,"This is a 'little' movie, missing the special effect set pieces and explosions of the usual 'Saturday night thriller'. There are some similarities to Pulp Fiction (jumping the timeline for starters) but it's played to low-key perfection by an excellent cast. At last super-slick Clooney is in a role tailor made - the chemistry between ex-ER doc and Lopez is very genuine.Audio and visual reproduction are superb, and special mention must be made of the wickedly hip soundtrack. Bonus materials are very worthy additions and make this thoughtful movie a definite collector's piece. The outtake of Clooney and Lopez in the boot (that's trunk to my American friends) is mesmerising.So go ahead...add some class to your DVD collection that's most likely busting at the seems with asteroids and action men!!"
3,Had its moments...,"I felt it tried to be ""Pulp Fiction,"" but it didn't quite live up to that trademark quirkiness that Tarantino brings. I normally go for anything with Jennifer Lopez in it, but this movie kind of dragged in places. The book is DEFINITELY better. I suggest reading the book while occasionally staring at a picture or two of Jennifer Lopez...the imagination can definitely come up with something better. I liked the soundtrack, though."
4,One of the best re-creations of Leonard's novels,"I found this movie a refreshing breakthrough from most of the Elmore Leonard novels. Lately, his popularity has grown so much (and it's about time) that they're finally making decent movies that are true to his books. I liked the non-linear movement in this film, and was really impressed with Jennifer Lopez, whom I've never seen in anything before. George Clooney is who he is - he was fun in this. Michael Keaton was wonderful. All these characters were so believeable - they screw up and I loved it. I'll buy it (when the price drops...)."
2,THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST BORING ACTION MOVIE OF ALL TIME!,"The story & characters were not compelling or believable in the least. The dialogue & scene shifts were awkward and confusing. It was a Herculean effort for me to stay awake through this movie. In fact, the two other people who watched this with me fell asleep within the first 15 minutes!"
3,This movie is over rated!,"It's a decent dvd rental but not something I'd go out and buy. The leads have great chemistry but the story line was so so. I think you have to be a true romantic to really like this movie (just like City of Angels, another movie I didn't like)."
4,out of Sight,"I think this movie is one of George clooneys best acting roles,also jennifer lopez is great in this.It is a good story and very entertaining."
2,"Not the Worst Film, But . . .","When bank robber Clooney is forced to kidnap federal marshall Lopez, you'd think that something would happen. It doesn't. Nothing much - other than the predictable - does happen in this film. Clooney plays the criminal with a heart of gold as if it were his ER character while Lopez is supposed to be playing a hardened federal agent but doesn't do much except appear beatiful in $900 suits. Not much to make a film on but they did.This isn't the worst film ever made, but it is a long, long way from being the best."
1,Terrible acting for George! Weak plot long and drawn out...,"Seeing George not in the ER setting, shows he is out of his league! Batman, and now this movie disappointed me."
1,So bad it's hilarious!,"I actually had a great time watching this movie because it's so bad, I laughed out loud throughout. All the positive reviews must be from people who are impressed with movies that have great looking people in them but don't mind that the plot is the most ridiculous piece of drivel ever written. Here's the whole movie: J Lo catches crook Clooney, sleeps with him, wakes up and he's gone, repeat...repeat....repeat.... Seriously! That is the WHOLE MOVIE! Every time she wakes up she's like ""Oh darn it. He's gone again. Guess I'll have to start over"". Critics were paid to give this movie good reviews; there's just no other explanation. As far as all the customers who gave it good reviews, I can only envy them for the great prescription medications they must be taking."
1,NOT MUCH TO SEE,I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS DVD GETS (****). MY OPINION IF YOU DON'T WATCH THIS FILM YOU DONT LOST TOO MUCH.
2,Didn't care for it.,I thought it was going to be very good because of J.LO and George Clooney. WRONG. This was as boring as tomato soup. Don't buy this.
4,Soderbergh's best since King of the Hill,"Very hip, funny movie but not overly cute like Ge Shorty.Beautiful cinematography, good story, Lopez is occasionally unconvincing as an FBI agent (too dumb) but ok. Don Cheadle and Isaiah Washington are hilarious, especially Washington who we are told in the commentary actually did field research in Detroit so he could talk in Detroit slang -- which was right on. Also, commentary by Soderbergh and writer is hilarious -- both are very sarcastic and self-deprecating, and all DVD commentaries should be 2-man teams. Deleted scenes usually don't float my boat, but Out of Sight has some good ones, especially the one with Don Cheadle."
3,"where'd the ""i own it"" button go ?","anyone know ? I enjoyed the book, but thought it took a while to get at the (main) story line. i did enjoy the side adventures, snowball fights, etc. but i enjoyed later books in the series much more."
3,A little noisy,I bought this for small room on the third floor. It works pretty well but is a little noisy. It is convenient to roll around upstairs though.
5,Portable Air Conditioner,Works great. Didn't run up my electric bill. Affordable. Easy to install. About as loud as a refrigerator when the motor kicks on. Looks nice. Can still open and close the window it's in and doesn't obstruct the view.I definitely would buy another one.
1,Don't Buy,"I'm 20 years old, and I bought this ring as a promise ring for my girlfriend. At first it was beautiful, and there were no problems, but she has had it for a little over a month and it has given her such a bad rash that she has started bleeding. This is not real sterling silver and looks poorly made. I would definitely never suggest anyone buy this ring."
5,An Underground smash at best &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;. but why not radio?,"This CD contains some of the smoothest, phatest, grooves for the bedroom. A true Playa's song, a true Pimp's groove, a real Mack's vibe. Fellas I'm telling you, play ""Submerge- Till We Be Come The Sun"" with Nag Champa insents burning in the room,....... you can't go wrong. Let the baseline take care of the rhythm and Maxwell will surely submerge you both with in the light. Me along with millions of others can't understand why this CD didn't get the props it deserves. The new single ""Get To Know Ya"" , got my ears open for sum' mo' Maxwell. I hope this one gets it's props like his first.oNe"
3,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed by this cd; I expected more. The songs all sound the same, same key, same beat, but Maxwell has a smooth voice and hopefully his next project will be better."
5,Bets CD I've ever owned.,"I love this CD. It is the only one I have where I listen to the whole CD, because all of the tracks are just so pleasant. Maxwell has a smooth sensous voice that can always get me in the mood."
5,A Worthy Follow-up,"Maxwell continues the groove he established with his Urban Hang Suite with Embrya. Although a couple of tracks go off the beaten path, the almost hypnotic ""Submerge: Til We Become the Sun"" and ""Gravity: Pushing to Pull"" bring you back. This is definitely worth its price."
3,Sweat and spirit,"Puerto-Rico's Maxwell is indeed quitte an artist . He writes these lushious slow melodies , sings them with the passion of a man in love and names them with these unusual long titles like ""Gravity:pushing to pull"" or ""Everwanting:to want you to want "" . What really makes him stand out though is the fact that in a time where soul music tends to be all about sex-appeal and shallow confessions of passion he prefers a more smooth , sensual approach of soul and funk and focuses more on expressing love through beautifully-crafted ballads and not some catchy radio-friendly tunes . Although not what you could call a gripping piece of music , "" Embrya "" is definitely a seductive , entincing offering ."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I love Maxwell's sound and voice, and I do believe he is so talented. However, I found many of tracks in this album are boring unlike 'Urban Hang Suite.' I will keep other CD, but not this one. Hope his next album is as good as the first one."
2,Not As Good As First Album,"It doesn't swing as much as the first CD, and I find the songs too slow and boring. The concept is just mediocre. I would not recommend it."
5,Maxwell is a breath of fresh air.,"Maxwell is a breath of fresh air in today's stale, smoky, and often crowded room of R&B today. Don't you get tired of hearing, ""Baby, Baby please?"", all the time? Brotha get off your knees! Maxwell doesn't do none of that. He slowly massages you into the right mood without calling you a b---h. (you know the correct spelling.) His voice and music leaves you wanting more, so thank God for instant repeat on the CD player."
4,"Would've been a five, but . . .","The problem with Maxwell now seems to be that he tries to be too different. What's up with these redundant song titles and the mysterious ""track 00""? He's a superb artist; very original and engaging, but he just needs to take it down a notch. By the way, it's a pretty good album."
5,Love in all her disguises...,What can I say? I love this man's music. He is truly a vessel for putting down the soulful peace and love/baby-making grooves.He is always on rotation in our CD player and my personal playlist.Mmmmm... Max!
2,so/so,"aside from Luxury Cococure,&Matrimony maybe you this disc is very average to boring.there are really no songs.to slow and not focused.it's a downer after the first album&unplugged show.but fourtunate is a step in the right direction.that song that came out just before last summer sounds better than over 90% of this disc.so there is hope."
2,Confused the hell out of me,"With his first album, Maxwell had the potential to be one of the greats and he almost lost all of it with this album. I do give Maxwell credit for attempting to be different however on this album he confused with the odd song titles and overall mood of the CD. Maxwell wants to be so much more than just another soul crooner, but his gifts become obscured the more he pushes them forward. Maxwell does have a remarkable voice and he can write really good modern soul songs -- it's just that he has a tendency to think that's not enough and then he overstuffs his songs with ideas that lead nowhere which is why this CD floped so hard. Luckily he reedemed himself with Fortunate in 1999 and his thrid CD NOW in 2001. Because this CD almost destroyed a promsing carrer."
1,WHAT?,I LIKE MAXWELL BUTTHIS ALBUM WAS BLENDEDTOO MUCH YOUCAN BARELYTELL THE SONGS APARTFROM ONE ANOTHERTHAT'S WHY I GAVE ITONE STAR IF ONLYTHERE WAS SOME DIVERSITYHERE WITH THE TRACKS I WOULDHAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS.
5,hot sexy stemming talent again,i love maxwel! his talent and voice range are outstanding!! when i feel MELLOW SMOOTH i put on some Maxwell!!
5,Instrumental,"I really enjoy listening to this CD. Maxwell again has outdone himself. This CD is more instrumental than lyrical to me, and allows you to really become one with the instruments. I find myself listening to tracks 1, 4, 5 and 6 over and over again. This man is the bomb!"
4,Lush,"Maxwell's ethereal falsetto is nicely complemented by a powerhouse band on his sophomore CD. From the opening chords of ""Everwanting,"" the listener is put on notice that his debut success was no fluke with a balance of funky cuts and simmering ballads. This is just good music period -- it works when you're chilling alone, when you're trying to set a mood, or when you are on the road. Not only is the music sublime, but the lyrics are sweet and sensitive without being sappy. Maxwell is coaxing his lover rather than begging, and it's very effective.My favorite track is ""Submerge,"" a slinky little cut that seeps into your subconscious. ""Cococure"" and ""Matrimony: Maybe You"" are also standouts. Oh heck, they're all good and I expected nothing less from this artist. The only downside is that all the tracks are really long like more than 4 minutes. It doesn't matter to me, but I'll bet that is the reason why this CD didn't receive much airplay on radio."
5,Embrya: His words echo beyond the end of each song,"I really enjoyed Maxwell's: Embrya. Unlike many artists out there, Maxwell seduces his listeners with with poetic words and mellow sounds to bring across his message. I extremly loved ""Submerge: Til We Become the Sun"" because it's not just about having sex but making love and becoming one with your partner. This track seduces the listener to the degree that you don't realize it, until the moment is over. Maxwell has written songs that I can truly admire and respect. It's about time we get back to the beauty of love making and sharing more than just a fleeting moment pleasure. His words truly echo beyond the end of each song."
4,One more that will stay in your cd player!,"Once again Maxwell comes through with his refreshing sound and soothing voice that is truly an ""experience"" when listening to. This cd as well as his first, Urban Hang Suite, is suitable for anything from a romantic interlude to driving in your car. He has this way of blending perfectly with the music, his voice IS an instrument!"
4,"moody, sensual but slightly less varied than the previous","Maxwell is definitely one of, if not the most sensual musicians around today. His lyrics and melodies move me in such a way I cannot describe. I am very impressed with Embrya but find myself comparing it to the previous album and longing it had the same am amount of variety. Nothing, for me, will ever surpass the wonderful song ""whenever, wherever"". Has anyone heard his version of Kate Bush's ""Woman's Work""? Amazing, truly amazing. Is he going to do a UK tour?"
5,Maxwell is the best.....,"From the first time I heard Maxwell sing, he is brilliant, sensual, very strong vocals and just a great entertainer. I recommend any of his CD's to music lovers who appreciate soulful, excellent delivery and songs that has very special meanings....."
5,BUY THIS,"THIS CD IS A CLASSIC. IF ""DROWNDEEP:HULA"" ISN'T ONE OF THE BEST SONGS IN THE LAST 5 YEARS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. THIS IS THE PERFECT MELLOW CD. GREAT BEATS AND MAXWELL CAN SING. BUY THIS NOW! YOU WON'T BE SORRY."
5,HE IS SO PERFECT AND WONDERFUL,I LOVE HIM HE IS MY EVERYDREAM COME TRUE. HE IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT I WOULD DO ANY THING TO HAVE HIM
4,Cargo of Eagles,"Enjoyable Allingham swansong. Has a melancholy air which contributes to the books success. Plenty of characters and action, at times it doesn't seem to be going anywhere, but it does. The solution is satisfying and effective."
4,Great!,"I watched this movie as a kid with my sister. My sister is no longer here but after some digging I found the title to this movie and bought it. It holds great sentimental value for me; and finding it was easier thanks to Amazon. Great movie, no problems through shipment nor of quality to the movie itself."
3,You have to be into foreign mysteries,Not as well done as the Wallender series. The characters are not as well developed or as likable. Scenery not as well done either. Ok show to watch if you like European crime mysteries.
4,Intrapartum Management Modules,Would highly recommend to any nurse new to labor and delivery. Works well as a supplement to unit orientation.
5,"All Obstetric RNs must buy, excellent for RNC study",This is an EXCELLENT book and a must have for all Obstetric RNs. Great explanations and easy to read. Has much more thorough explanations of pathophysiology than some of the other obstetric texts. The text also has a good review and practice tests in the back. This was my favorite book for studying for the Obstetric RNC exam. Highly recommended!
4,Modules,"Awesome, an excellent source of information for RNs, LVNs or anyone wishing to study for their RNC and working on L&D units."
1,intrapartum Management Modules:a Perinatal Education Program,I ordered a used book the used book seller did not specify the copy wright or the edition number I got an old edition that is totally useless to me and I have to go through the trouble of returning it and may be getting my money back. It makes ordering on line very unreliable.
4,Great Goods,"Rapid service, quick arrival, perfect goods. What more could anyone want?Quick and cordial responses to queries, too!"
1,A photographer!?!? with questionnable intellectual honesty,"I meant to give a rating below 1 Star but since this is the lowest, I hope that potential readers won't throw away their hard earned cash in buying this book. If you still want to buy it, go to your local bookstore as you will have a greater chance of finding a DUSTY copy of this book: ... ... G.P. Barbieri is without contest a good snapshooter if one judges it from the TECHNICAL quality of his work. But where he fails is in his intellectual honesty: How could ... a book [like this be about ]Madagascar if it only contains mediocre nude or semi-nude works done at few huts at the shore of Madagascar? I think and agree with many readers ... that not only exploited and disrespected his subjects by including them in the wrong publication, but he has also made a disservice for all photographers out there who at least have the decency of intellectual honesty and respect to the art. But then, ... what is art and what isn't?"
2,Find a more recent guide,"While well-written and easy to follow, this guide is nevertheless sadly out of date. It does not contain any of the information a current student will need to prepare a term paper according to today's standards and requirements. I strongly suggest you look at some other resource,to avoid wasting time using unacceptable format and citations that will require complete revision of the term paper later."
3,Outstanding,"This CD ranks as one of the 5 best rock and roll CDs I have ever heard. It is as good as any Led Zepplin album. If you enjoy rock and roll, this is a must have."
3,CLASSIC TENAGLIA IBIZA PIANO HOUSER...,"I PICKED THIS UP A YEAR OR SO AGO, AND IT REALLY COMES OUT ON THOSE SPECIAL TERRACE SUNSET OR BEACH SETS...FUNKY AND LONG, HEAD FOR FIRE ISLAND'S REMIX...TEN MINUTES OF PURE TERRACE ACTION..A PIANO RHYTHM THAT MIXES EXTREMELY WELL ALONGSIDE TRIBAL OR MINIMAL TRACKS..."
4,Folksongs from Bavaria,"outstanding sampler of bavarian music. Has a high tech sound mix which appeals to casual and/or easy listening. Fell one star short only because my personal preference for that rough um bah ba sound. Glad I bought this CD, and, off course, I recommend it because it gives me, well, a touch of bavarian class, --enjoy---"
5,Very nice.,I found this CD very enjoyable to listen repeatedly. I do not hesitate to recommend it to anybody who likes music from the Alps and vicinity.
4,GOOD GERMAN TASTE,"A great a idea to appreciate German style songs. They are very well performed. It let's you appreciate music from that European country and enjoy a party, as Germans use to do. There is a little sample of the Yodel style in one of the songs here contained. A great entertainment for you."
4,Just What I was Looking for,"After a trip to Germany, I wanted to create a music/picture video for my family & friends and I needed German music.This was exactly the music I was looking for."
4,Comprehensive catalog of portfolio management techniques,"Three professors, Robert G. Cooper, Scott J. Edgett and Elko J. Kleinschmidt, wrote this book. The good news is that they really know their stuff; the less-than-great news is that they write like, well, professors. The book is hampered by academic prose, qualifiers, tangents and a scholarly, if balanced, reluctance to commit completely to most propositions. We find that readers seeking a comprehensive catalog of product portfolio management techniques will benefit from the detailed initial chapters. Meanwhile, readers who are in search of practical, applicable information will find more of what they want in the later chapters."
5,A book from the real world,This book offers you some highly practical methods for managing your portfolio of new product development projects. It is based on research on which methods leading companies use and which of these methods generate good results. Bob Cooper has written a book that makes a quite complicated subject clearer and much more easy to understand.
1,No Scoring Scales!,"Page 5 of this book indicates that scoring scales are provided after each practice test. They are not, at least in my copy. How disappointing and wasteful to take the practice tests and not be able to find out your score!"
1,Not the waterproof seat shield I expected.,"I thought I was buying a Waterproof SeatShield that a running friend recommended but it turns out this is a different product. It's a coated nylon cover that bunched up around my seat. It probably deserves a better rating for hunting or work purposes, but it is sticky and sweaty if it comes in contact with skin like when I'm in shorts. Unfortunately the other product wasn't sold on Amazon so I had to return this one and buy it from the manufacturer website."
5,Great covers,"This my 2nd set in my work truck. The 1st set were used and abused, but my seats are perfect. Thats why the replacment set of Grants!"
2,Not enough!,"I was hoping to find a book that would aid me in teching grammar in my 6th grade classroom. Instead, I found a book that was not user friendly and did not offer many reproducible pages. Many of these lessons were not exciting and I did not feel that my students would have been excitied to learn about any of the concepts covered using the prescribed lessons. I was even bored reading it! This book is now collecting dust on my bookshelf."
3,I think it tastes great but...........,"This price is a little high. You can generally buy it in a grocery store for around $1.25 a bottle.For some reason the seller claims they don't like the flavor. It tastes like ORange Hi-C which I think is good. Kind of like less sugary Kool Aid. I love the taste. Plus, there are 2.5 servings in each bottle - so each bottle is 125 calories.The product is good. I think Revive flavor is the best."
1,better off with a gatorade and a vitamin pill,"tastes awfulonly provides about 10% of some vitamins63 caloriesdeceptive nutrition label [bottle contains ""1.25 servings"" give me a break]wle."
4,Top Notch Score As Well,"This movie has an excellent, really affecting score by musical theatre composer John Kander."
3,"It's just an autobiaography - Nothing more, nothing less.","The title is deceiving. She doesn't talk much about the strength of women. That is definitely NOT the focus of the book. But, she does write about her life, which is quite interesting. It's good if you want to read a biography. She has an eventful life, so it's not boring to read, in the slightest. Check it out."
3,Could've been more informative,"The book was an easiy read. But I felt like there were a lot of blank spots left in between. She really didn't get as detailed as I would have like her too. The book was still interesting, but this is basically an outline of her life."
4,The truth about Queen Latifah,"This book isn't like most biographies. It isn't another glamorous tale about a flawless mediaperson. It is a true tale about the wonderful person that is Queen Latifah. What makes this book so different, is that she tells you about the mistakes she has made in her life, about her flaws, and about her strengths. You get to know her in a way that isn't possible with most famous people, because you never hear about their flaws. That makes them unreal. But this is a tale about a real person's road to fame. And it is written in a great way. A must read for all her fans, and for everyone that are looking for answers in their life. You can learn a lot from her experience. I would highly recommend it!"
1,It was bad,"Lady's First is an uninteresting, boring, and pointless book. Queen Latifah should stick to music, because writing about her uneventful life is not working. So she was famous at 19, what the hell does this have to do with ladies being first. I was very upset that I spent my money on this garbage. Some points made were good, but anyone could have and do say them all the time. Don't forget your a lady, keep your head up, etc...."
4,Very good choice for a plasma screen,"I've owned this model for about six weeks now. It's my first large screen TV purchase but I researched pretty thoroughly beforehand.Pros:1. Beautiful picture both in HD and regular signal. DVD's and even VHS tapes look good as well2. Very competitive price. Most 50"" plasmas are at least $800 more.3. Plenty of inputs and outputs. Multiple inputs for component and composite devices plus a VGA port for PC's.Cons:1. Draws a lot of power. It's 450 watts but that's in line with other similar plasmas.2. Has only a HDMI input for digital whereas many devices such as PC's and cable boxes have DVI. Requires a pricey conversion cable to use. Luckily, I think the component connection looks as good as the HDMI one.3. Controls and menus could be more efficient. Common commands like input selection require arrowing through menus instead of just scrolling through using a single button like most TV's.So far so good though."
4,"Adjustable, comfortable but not very dark",I used some of the clear version of these as safety glasses and thought they were comfortable and adjustable to fit almost any face. Then I found they were available tinted and thought they would make good sunglasses. They are not dark enough for full sun.
5,Received the wrong one,"Amazon also sent me the wrong DVD. They had the Universal Legacy Series image when I ordered it, but I received the Universal Legacy Collection instead. This was very disappointing as it was supposed to be a present for someone who has all the others from the series. I see that the one I thought I was getting won't be released until February 2010 so I will order again then.This movie is wonderful."
1,the wolf man,"I was dissapointed in this one.I kept ordering it till I get the front cover right,I never got the cover as the website describes,it arrived good,but not the same cover.But don't worry I got the cover elsewhere,and I still shop on amazon."
3,A Universal Classic! But?,"This is a Classic Monster Film rated up there with All the Universal Monsters.Corny Dialog,especially when Larry Is Hitting On Gwen,way outdated but i guess for those times.Otherwise a Cool Atmospheric b&w; Flick Great Beast Makeup Used On Lon.I rate this Fair even though a Classic not one of my favs."
1,Wrong Picture On DVD Cover!,"The one star is strictly for the DVD cover that Universal produced for this Special Edition. The Wolfman on the cover is from ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEETS FRANKENSTEIN (1948) and not the original THE WOLFMAN (1941). In fact, Jack Pierce did not design this version of The Wolfman. Wish they would have gone with a correct photo. Still i plan to purchase this DVD, despite the cover."
2,This is a classic?,"It's badly acted and badly directed. The script is passable. The only real shining light in it is Claude Rains. He makes the rest of the cast look better with every scene he is in.If you're looking for a classic monster flick, might I suggest Dracula, The Mummy, Frankenstein, or any of the silent monster flicks. If you're looking for a classic werewolf flick...Well, I hate to say it, but there never has been one. Though you could give the Howling and American Werwolf in London a try."
2,Tedious and clumsy,"The Bottom Line:One of those movies that's labelled a classic even though it's a dated and mediocre film, The Wolf Man feels long even while clocking in at a scant 70 minutes and largely consists of Lon Cheney running around in a ridiculous bear costume; I recognize how significant this movie was (our entire pop cultural idea of the werewolf was pretty much hammered out by this film and its sequels) but it pales in comparison to anything James Whale did in the same time period.2/4"
3,an OK disappointment,"for a so-called ""classic horror movie"" from 1939-41 era this one is definitely the least horrorific."
2,"""Woof"" Man deserves to sleep in doghouse","Wow, what a disappointment this was for me! I had such high hopes going into this one because of some of the fine supporting actors, namely Claude Rains and Warren William. But no amount of debonair Englishmen or American smooth operators could counteract the terrible Lon Chaney Jr as the eponymous Wolf Man. Alright, so he's not much to look at (being turned into a WolfMan did him no disservice, actually), but what I really objected to was that Chaney's character was, well, a creep before he ever met up with those darned gypsies. Look at how he meets the girl: he gets a hold of a telescope and starts peering in bedroom windows. That's not the most romantic hero I ever saw, you know? And just why was he alienated from dad Claude Rains anyway? Was it for this kind of nasty voyeurism? And how could such a lumbering fellow ever have sprung from the loins of elegant Claude Rains either? Bad, bad dog!"
1,I hated this movie because the wolfman wasn't in it for long,"The only thing I liked about this movie was the cover. I have watched most of the horror classics ,and I did not like this movie because lon Chaney jr. played larry Talbot more that he did the wolfman. A movie called the wolfman should have the wolfman in it more. I liked Bela Lugosi in this movie and Lon Chaney Jr. Ian Grant Thompson age six."
2,Has Very Little Bite,"I can now add 1941's The Wolfman to the list of classic movies that I don't understand why they're classics. I guess my attention span is far shorter than a lot of people's. I found this movie to be very slow with almost no action and zero scares. I much prefer An American Werewolf In London, The Howling, and Silver Bullet. I liked the scene where Lon Chaney first realizes he's a werewolf, and starts sprouting fur. Other than that, I was bored. I hope the new Wolfman is more entertaining than this."
4,Wolf Man,The Wolf Man is one of the lesser of the great Universal horror classic but still a classic. It is about a werewolf who doesn't want to be one. The only real problem with the movie is a lack of motivation. We know that you don't want to be a werewolf. If you want to see a better movie see the original Frankenstein but still don't miss the Wolf Man!P.S. Does anyone remember the ending? I forgot it and it's really bugging me.
5,a true horror movie,"this was the first classic horror movie I ever saw and boy was i glad it was this one. from begining to end i watched waiting to see what would happen next. lon did a super great job. after i saw it, i knew i had to get it for myself. i suggest that you get it to. a great movie which also leads up to another great movie ""frankenstein meets the wolfman."""
4,This is worth owning for yourself and the children.,"The kids of today will look at the scene where Lon Chaney changes into a wolf and probably laugh at the ""primitive"" special effects. However, once they see that this is a horror movie with an actual plot they may have a better appreciation for what a good horror movie can be. They can compare this movie with the current films that have body parts falling to the side and rivers of blood as substitutes for an entertaining story. Lon Chaney, Jr. gives one of his best performances and how can you not sympathize with the poor guy. Evelyn Ankers is worth howling for. And the gypsy woman is as convincing a character as you can hope to find."
5,Great package,"This new compilation really offers one thing in addition to the previous green jacket edition but it is a great documentary on Lon Chaney Jr. And that alone is worth the sale price. I didn't notice any difference in the clarity of the original film but ""The Wolf Man"" still ranks among the all time greats of the Universal horror classics.A great watch!"
5,"Good Socks, Good Price, I like Much","I was pleased with the look and feel of these socks. They are a medium weight and do not have that coarse interior fleece that most sports and exercise socks have, which is what I am after. Nicely made and a long enough length to reach up on the calves so they do not need to be so tight in order to stay up.I got 6 pairs in assorted colors and am back for some black ones too.Tiny little seam on top of the toes is the only spot that is not perfectly smooth and of even thickness.Sometimes my feet hurt when there is too much in the way of lumps and uneven thickness- these do not have any of those problems.I would have to say that these are a good buy and a well made product that I will continue to purchase in the future. Many vibrant colors."
5,It's a sock!,"Bought these for a costume. Arrived quickly, and are very nice, heavy duty socks. Would recommend, and may purchased other colors."
5,Rock 'N' Roll!,"""Powertrip"" #97 1998).Monster Magnet's ""Powertrip"", is still their most solid recording. Vocalist Dave Wyndorf had just turned 42 years old, at the time of this recording. You can't go wrong with any of these powerful rockers that run the gamut from 60's punk-rock to 90's metal. Here are my favorites, ""Crop Circle"", the Dick Daleish ""19 Witches"", ""See You In Hell"", ""Temple Of Your Dream"" #25 MSR, the classic ""Space Lord"", #3 MSR and #29 modern rock, the title track #20 MSR, ""Bummer"" and ""Your Lies Become You"". This would be their last great album, until 2010's ""Mastermind"" ****1/2."
5,Jet fuel powered mind blower,This is by far the best album ever produced by this band. Not a bad song or piece on the entire thing.
3,"Mixed Bag Here, but still good","I am not a long time fan, hell you couldn't even call me a casual fan. I was attracted to this CD for ""Spacelord"" that song is just kickin', and I was glad to find a handful or so more tracks that I could really get into. ""Tractor"" is great and real heavy too, the guitar solo and drumming just rumble on through my brain, good stuff. The ballad of sorts ""Your Lies Become You"" it builds up nice to the chorus. ""See You In Hell"" has an awesome vibe to groove to, great for ambience music while working. This album manages to add experimental sounds into a somewhat typical 90s metal sound, but it does the job well.This CD still gets a few spins once and awhile. Even if you've never been into Monster Magnet before there is plenty to like here. By no means a must have but definately worth adding to your collection. I says get it! 8/13"
3,3.5 stars,"in the past MM were known for combining psychadelic music with heavy rock and the results were extraordinary. POWERTRIP drops the psychadelic end to give you full blast modern heavy rock and the magnet do it well. the songs here such as bummer and crop circle are strong intense and just blow me away but i find without the psychadlic end, MM are just another band. there is nothing to set them apart and this album, while good, is missing something. a hair above mediocre it blasts out with above average on all levels but i think they are capable of much MUCH more."
3,Monster Magnet - 'Let It Ride' (A&M),"Basically, one non-lp track CD single of ""Big God"" that was first available 'free' in most music stores for like a month or so after the release of Monster Magnet's 'Powertrip' CD. Then there's a ten second snippet, ""Say It"" of a girl repeatedly saying the band's name. ""Big God"" here is your typical space metal slammin' Magnet, but the price here is a bit steep for a one song-track CDS."
4,"good, but dopes to infinity was a lot better.","this cd is good, but it gets a little to strange at times. it just loses momentum after track 9 ( see you in hell). the best tracks are 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11. i liked it, but it takes patience, so give it time."
4,Well Done,"I loved this CD! Dave Wyndorf rocks! These are the real people with the initials MM! Not Marilyn Manson! And I said ""Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww! Space Lord Mother Mother""!"
4,Very well made..........but some flaws,"the melodies are great the songs are smooth....but the song ""3rd eye landslide"" sounds like bleccch......but the rest of the CD is great."
5,ROCK IS STILL ALIVE,"Monster Magnet has been a staple in my cd collection since '95 and should be in any rock afficianado's cd case. All of their cds are worth getting and i won't hesitate to get the soon to be released fifth cd ""God says NO"" or the other possible title ""Heads Explode."" Hopefully the sooner the better."
3,"This album rocks, but, it's not going to change the world.","To be a truly classic rock album, your music has to be copied by other bands. MM is doing the opposite of this, they are stealing '80s sounds, and this CD is way to extreme to be copied by musicians today. Still, ""Powertrip"" is a great disc to play when you are mad at the world and want to yell."
2,"Good Riffs, inconsistant songwrting.","Not a bad CD, the riffs are good, but some of the lyrics venture off into Spinal Tap territory with the sexual metaphors and images that I had to laugh at some of those. In other songs, the lyrics were more creative, but most of the time they just got in the way for me. However, like I said the riffs are pretty solid throghout."
2,Please dont be fooled by everyone and there reviews,"so far this cd has gotten 4 and a half stars on average, give me a break, you would have to pay me to listen to this, it gets boring sooo fast so dont waste your money. it does however have a couple of good tracks like space lord and something else. all well pretty much i hate it. It makes me wanna lift my head up high and blow my brains out."
2,One Good Song,"Monster Magnet's song powertrip and an excellent peice of music, although the rest of the CD is hardly as well done as this song, in fact it is not very good at all."
1,Horrible,This is a horrible cd. If it's 80's type hair bands that you are into then maybe this is the one for you but i have never heard such an horrible sound in my life. The constant screaming does nothing for the album. Dear MR magnet please do us all a favor and stop torturing us.
5,They have a reason to be POWERTRIPIN',"Monster Magnet is awsome. Powertrip is one great heavy meatal album. They sure can rock. With songs like CROP CIRCLES and SPACE LORD, how could the fail. They are one of the best band out right now."
4,Monstrous.,"You can pretty much just look at the cover of this album and know it's gonna be good. Anybody who's drawn to the Magnet (pun intended), should totally dig this. It's their typical psychedelic-stoner-metal. I hesitate to say Powertrip is as good as Dopes, but it's roughly as rockin'. ""Crop Circle"" and the title track kick this off in grand style, and it doesn't let up much after. ""Space Lord"" of course is the bomb, and drops like one. ""Bummer"" is classic. I approve of any song that starts with the lyrics ""you're looking for the one who F'd your mom, it's not me"". If looking for your first Monster Magnet disc, this is a good pick. Fans of The Atomic Bitchwax, Soundgarden, and QOTSA enjoy."
5,Excellent,I just love this CD. When I got it I went around my basement playing all of my Nintendo64 games and Sony Playstation games. I listen to all the time even when I am asleep. Please get everybody to buy this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Not Bad for 6 US Dollars,"This particular cd is an excellent choice for those who want an introduction to organ music. The collection music from germany, England, and France - the three main categories of organ music. The only downside to this CD is that only part 1 of the Toccata and Fugue in d-minor BWV565 is on this CD. Overall, the performances are not bad. However, there are better recordings of this stuff."
2,so where is the organ,"i agree the selections are iffy, and there are better versions, but my main complaint is much like the old, 'where is the beef' ad.just where is the organ...minimal is the answer. i bght this to hear mostly heavy duty organ, this did not even begin to satisfy that yen."
3,This is the first book I read from this author,"I thought this book really started out great, I liked the idea oftwo sisters who looked very similar to each other, and how the older sister, Elyn was to wed Kelan and how she ""talked"" her sister into marrying him, ""in name only"" until she returned from her tryst with her lover whom was bretrothed to another woman. The sister, Kiera, marries Kelan and she falls in love with him. Elyn after having a terrible fight with Brock, disappears.I liked this book until about 3/4 or alittle more of the ways inwhen books are supposed to really ""heat"" up. Well, this one sort of fizzled out, and I was disappointed.I only give this book three stars."
2,The Impostress,"The story begins as a girl falls from her horse. She is in a forest, and a ruffian finds her and nearly rapes her. Saved by her sister, she swears to help her if she ever needs it. Soon after, her sister asks her to stand in for her on her wedding night, while she goes to see her lover.This was a badly written story with improbably characters and a vapid premise. The heroine lies her way through the story, and the plot is flimsy and tangled. The two sisters are not very likeable and the hero doesn't ever come to life in the book. All in all, a disappointing read."
5,A satisfying read!,This book was amazing. The plot was in depth and obviously well thought out. The characters were very likeable too. Everything about this book screams master piece. The only issue I had was how he reacted when he found out the truth. The ending was satisfying though! I highly recomend Impostress.
1,A Terrible Fall For Stuart Wilde,"For years I have been a fan of Stuart Wilde, often an uncomfortable one, who has been challenged by his ideas and ideals. I ordered God's Gladiators and read it cover to cover the day it arrived. I immediately went into a long clinical depression (my first) while I tried to wrestle with the dark world he has invented. Now that I am well medicated and almost a year into therapy, I can see the book for what it is, and objectively: The Ravings Of A Liar Or A Madman. If the book is meant to be a metaphor, Wilde pointing out that the devil story IS a metaphor only makes it appear the rest of the book is not. I think this old man has gone bonkers, right out to lunch, and is quite possibly schizophrenic. Try holding up any of his claims to scientific scrutiny and I bet we'll find nothing that can be proven. This is a sad and dangerous book by a sick man who used to have something to say. Total BS. I wonder what Wayne Dyer thinks of this crap?"
3,Very Interesting Book.,I recommend reading ALL of Stuart Wilde's books. He will change the way you thik about thinking.
3,Pressure Drop - Elusive,"Well, what can I say? This album is really hit AND miss for me. I feel half the tracks are stellar and the other half are abysmal failures, sometimes downright annoying. Fortunately, the other tracks are just so good that I had to keep it, but really I have not ever listened to such a lopsided CD in my life. So in closing, I can do no more than give this average rating, there is some gold in there, but you have to sift through crap to find it."
3,"Intriguing, but raw","Some moments on this album knock you out of the ballpark, but those moments are few and far between, separated by sometimes annoying ""supa-diva"" vocals and spoken word/singsong elements. Otherwise, innovative, rooted music for the groove set."
3,"Good start, needs work","the tracks on this album that are good are really good. But the rest definitly need some work. this band has a similar flavor to massive attack, but they just dont have the same flair yet. But I think it will come out."
3,Interesting role reversal for Jamie Lee Curtis,"What's this? Jamie Lee Curtis is the bad guy, not the victim? Yes, she really can act (not just scream). This movie can be summed up in one word: predictable. If you've ever seen Fatal Attraction, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, or any other film of that ilk, then you've pretty much seen this one, too. Still, it's worth watching, if for no other reason than to see Jamie Lee in the role of the psychopathic killer."
5,Review of Mother's Boys (Film),"I think that this film is superb.It wonderfully creates an atmosphere of tension and release which makes it both dramatic and gripping.Jamie Lee Curties shines in her role as the somewhat psychologically disturbed mother, but performs with style and flair. The support cast is equally excellent, and this movie is entertaining from beginning to end. I rate this 5 stars as it goes along side my other favourite films and it is one that you can watch over and over without tiring of it."
4,"This is Jamie Lee Curtis, one of her best performance.","Director Yves Simoneau did great job on the acting on the film. Jamie Lee Curtis is very good as the film bad mother and dangerous woman, it also the only film as the villain.For Jamie Lee Curtis Fans should take a look to this supense film."
1,Jamie Did This One For The Money,"What other explanation could there be for Jamie Lee Curtis agreeing to appear in this laughably horrible ""thriller?"" She plays a mentally disturbed ex-wife and mother who returns after many years to reclaim her family. Oops! Daddy has already found a new girlfriend. Oops again! The kids like the girlfriend! Of course, mayhem ensues, right up until the literal ""cliffhanger"" ending.The director either ran out of film, or decided he couldn't possibly wrap the story up neatly, because the big climatic scene suddenly simply ends without explanation or resolution.The best part of this film is watching Jamie Lee do her best impersonation of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. Even if you're able to rent this one at the local video store for under a buck, you're spending too much."
2,Grey hair,"Unless you have lighter than medium blonde hair, this just appears grey. Me and my friends tried it and it worked on me, only because I have light golden blonde hair but on everyone else it looked grey. Also, it even turned my hair a grey if i put too much of it in. And it turns your skin sparkly for about a week afterward... Its very hard to control it because it sprays everywhere so streaks are virtually impossible."
1,good product but wrong color,I gave it one star becasue I was thinking platinum blonde not platinum silver. So it didn't do me any good.
1,What a mess!,"I had really high hopes for this Platinum color spray. It's sprays out SO hard and fast that it was basically like a huge glob of this glittery stuff on the top of my head. It looked awful, smelled awful, and is basically just light glitter. Also, after I sprayed it one time, that was it... there was nothing left in the can!! A total rip off.YUCK. I learned my lesson, and I'm never buying this again. The good thing is that it washed out right away."
4,i liked it,"it is well written by an author who tried what he wrote. I did not try it yest, but it looks usefull"
3,Nutritional information is good,The book has good nutritional information in it. I do not approve of the rabid defamation of the medical community. He wastes words and my time trying to defame the current system. My brief research proves that there is a great deal of research being done by astute medical institutions. He could cut all that out and get to the point.
1,Risky advice...at best,"I am surprise this book was published. It is full of inaccuracy and questionable advice. For example the author states the biopsy is painful. I had one last week with no pain whatsoever. He also states that his doctor made an appointment for him to have surgery the next day. There is no way that would happen. The colon must heal for several weeks before surgery can be preformed and the urologists will want to discuss treatment options. Prostate cancer is very slow growing therefore it is not urgent to remove it immediately. There are many, many more examples. It is scary to thing how many people may have missed their chance to remove their cancer and instead followed this book. Once the caner goes outside the gland there is NO turning back and NO cure is possible at that point. A cure is 100% if the glad is removed in time to stop the spread. Want to risk your life with this publication???? There is no clinical evidence to support the authors assertions."
1,Many Conclusions and Opinions- Little Evidence,"Offers many unique and very unusual opinions, but unfortunately almost none are supported by direct references to a study, clinical trial, or scientific article. Statement after statement is presented as fact with no support. With so many strong conclusive statements presented, if the results are so clear, where are the studies, medical articles and comparative trails with supporting results!! Book cannot or doesn't provide. Appendix does provide general references/addresses/phone numbers of other ""..Healers and Products"". I do not recommend this book"
5,"You Know How You Hear, 'This Book Changed My Life'","Well this book did. I'm a pretty skeptical person in general. Believe me when I say, I could have easily been another victim of conventional medical methods and unnecesarily forfeited my bodyparts to surgery or radiation. Luckily, Im curious as well as skeptical. I researched the web and found Dr. Clapp's book. Dr. Clapp healed himself from prostate cancer and has done leading edge research and investigaton into what works to heal prostate cancer. His book is easy to understand and the methods he imparts not only guided me towards healing my prostate cancer, it also changed my entire lifestyle and attitude towards health. If you have prostate cancer and you've got one book to read this should be the one. If you've got any other type of cancer than this book should be one of the ones you read, and if you just want to know more about how alternative health works this one will give you a unique and up to date perspective on the subject."
5,I will follow this program the rest of my life,"""Prostate Health in 90 Days"" is excellent beyond words. On receiving a copy ordered from the Web and scanning it briefly, I gave it to my ranch manager. He is a young, strong man. On his vacation he read the book and followed your program as you presented it. He was completely healthy but had been told that 90% of all people harbor parasites as the book also says. He effusively prasied the program while urging me to follow it. His ebullience convinced me to try it. I did and it is to my mind the single most important health program one can follow. I convinced my local health food shop to carry the book. It is something I will follow the rest of my life."
1,I threw it in the trash in one day!,I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is riddled with new-age and eastern mysticism. It is lacking any solid documentation for the author's claims which are so outlandish it was hard to believe anyone would publish this book. I was truly disappointed. Don't bother buying it.
1,Built on beleifs rather than science,"Very repetitive, based on personal opinions that are made to look like ""the absolute truth"". I sent the copy I bought to be recycled with brown paper bags."
1,Turned off,"I bought this book for a loved one who was diagnosed with prostate cancer and has since been cured through surgery. He got to the parts about massaging his prostate and meditating several times a day and was turned off by the book. I have not read it myself, but am returning it since it will not be read further."
1,Misinformation,I am surprised...[this book was clearly misleading]. Mr. Clapp's advice is dangerous in that readers may defer seeking competent medical advice based on his recommendations. Certainly his claimed credentials warrant question. Instead of the required minimum rating of 1 it should be a minus 5.
1,QUACK,Risks doing serious harm to patients with prostate cancer. Treatment of prostate cancer should be left to qualified Urologists and Oncologists.
2,sure glad he got better,"the first trevor rabin solo album i picked up was ""can't look away"" and loved it. ever since i've been trying to find some of his earlier material. i think i will end my quest after listeninig to this one. it's got some catchy riffs here and there, but overall it's pretty cheesy."
3,As smart as he is...,"He's very talented, there is no doubt and he can play guitar..!Trevor knows how to ""stage"" his guitar solo's and for guitar players that's a lot of fun.. but the songs feel kinda old now on this disc and they all have an early 80's sound-track feel to them (which makes sense, that's what he does)This CD is good, but get Big Generator and 90125 from YES first, you get better songs and a better recording and all around better music - after you own those two and you need more Trevor this CD is a good place to look"
5,A good book for starting or improving your school studio,"This is a good book if you are looking to start a school TV program, or improve the program you've got. I am a school media specialist, and we do a lot these days - librarian, web-master, research teacher, TV producer. This book helped me improve my school TV program. It described a lot of equipment that was previously unfamiliar to me. It also told me what to look for in various equipment (audio mixer, video mixer, etc.) My next purchase is probably a video editor, and this book tells me what features to look for. My students have created several of the video projects enclosed, and students and teachers like them alot. Buy this book if you want to improve your school tv studio."
5,Great!,This is really good if you are starting a school news show from scratch. It has great project ideas!
3,Another version of a seemingly enigmatic life,"People generally speak of this bio when talking about ""the good ones"" on Henry Miller. I disagree. While in-depth, many facts listed are incorrect because of a lack of checking (although many checkers were used) with factual records. Dearborne's biggest angle seems to be to show that Miller was always a closet homosexual & June was a lesbian junkie. While interesting to fans of Miller, a much better written, more accurate biography is available from Robert Ferguson & I would highly recommend reading his version over Dearborne's if you were to only read one Miller bio."
3,story good art bad,"I don't what it is with the off-kilter independent comic book artists. They are so stylized that they create ""BAD ART"". The story in My War w/ Brian is quite good, but even too 'everyman' middle of the road. Some of it is quite funny.But I still don't get the art. It is almost so bad I can't enjoy reading it the second or third or fourth time. (Heck, I may have enjoyed R. Crumb's word way too much reading the same tome 30 or 40 times over) CCG ""Fuzzy Bear"""
4,personal tale of woe,"Ted Rall is nothing if not a masterful teller of his own story. If you've suffered from bullying, pick it up - worth the green."
5,Good story! Wish I would use these techniques!,Mr. Rall sent me a text only version of this book through e-mail and I loved it! I'm buying this book since its nice to have a hard copy. I wish I had the guts to use these on my High School enemies(But there is already enough school violence!)
5,Very cool book,"Flower essences have always been fascinating to me. So when I found a book that talked about essences from the desert I lived in, I had to get it. It's got a lot of cool info!"
1,sigh....,"This is a high school education level book. If you know anything about the real estate business, do not purchase this book. You will be greatly disappointed. The book is very general, gives no specifics or details about anything, and i marvel that there was actually a publisher willing to print this book. I guess i should write a commercial real estate book because it seems they are in short order. I would instead purchase a book by Jack Cummings and then find a good commercial company to work for."
5,Best Book on the Market,"As a former commercial real estate broker, I believe that this is the best book on the market. The turnover rate among new real estate brokers is extremely high. One of the reasons for such high turnover is the lack of knowledge about real estate as well as the brokerage business.The author educates readers how to choose a brokerage company by analyzing the company's size, fee splits, training, benefits, employment agreements, staff support, and much more. He also teaches about contracts, marketing, salesmanship, and prospecting for clients. I learned more from this book alone than I did from the training I received at one of the top commercial real estate firms in the country.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
4,Good for starters and reference,"I am a researcher at a commercial brokerage, still have one year of college left, and looking to get into brokerage once I graduate. This book is great for beginners and to use for reference. My designated broker is pretty busy so at work I mostly just dive into my tasks and learn a lot as I do them. The book made a lot of sense of what I am doing, what I need to be doing, and the best way to do it. I especially like the Salesmanship part of this book. I now keep it in my desk for reference. The contracts portion and other techinical parts wasn't as interesting for beginners like me, but the basics are great. It talks about farming, phone skills, and motivational thoughts about building your own business. I read this book in two days."
5,How to Succeed in Commercial Real Estate,"As someone knowing nothing about commercial real estate and wanting to learn, I felt this book to be extremely informative and exactly what I was looking for. The Author explained the ""how"" behind it all, as well as giving detailed information like vocabulary and equations. Very glad I purchased this book."
4,How to Succeed in Commercial Real Estate,"Mr. Bowman has done a fine job of explaining the in's and out's of commercial investment real estate. This book is an absolute must read for anyone thinking of making the transition to commercial investment real estate. The book is very informative and well written. The examples are well thought out. I have all my agents reading my annoted copy. If there were one defecit it would be that the treatment of some of the topics was a little light. That is probably as a result of the vast differences in the practice across the country. Still, the book is well written, easy to read and understand and I highly recommend it."
4,Not too bad...,"Don't be fooled by the title, the author spends a lot of the book explaining the realities of retirement. That is, we're living longer in retirement and not saving enough to meet the challenge that presents. Early retirement will take a determined effort and persistent savings to achieve. Just think about it, if you retire at 55 and expect to live to 90 you are talking about 35 years of living off your investments! The book is well written and even gives some good ideas of what towns you might want to consider for retirement living. Retirement, let alone early retirement presents a challenge for everyone, this book is a good place to begin thinking about the subject."
3,Sugary,"Sweet as cotton candy, and with about as much substance. Great if you want a feel-good book with no plot complications or messy details, but there's no real meat to it."
3,SAP R/3 for the Informix DBA,"It is not a bad book for the person with no Informix background It is a good book for knowing the basis facts about the informix dbase. However, it does not explain completely full integration concepts between SAP and informix to sap administrator.From ThakerPranavFrom Pranav"
1,"Not unique, at least for non-Polish speakers","If you are looking for uniquely Polish ways of putting things or uniquely Polish proverbs, this isn't the book you want. The book is a collection of proverbs that translate into English, specifically with English equivalents. Some of them are simply the Polish translations of biblical proverbs and Latin tags; some others are Polish ways of expressing the standard proverbs but are translated as the English version of the proverb. I'm still looking for a book of uniquely Polish idiomatic phrases I ran across a while back; this isn't it."
4,This book has very useful information and is well laid out.,I brought it home to my family during the holidays and my polish grandparents loved it. Alot of the proverbs were ones they remember from when they were little.
5,Bye Bye Balloon,"This was such a God-inspired book, I could not put it down. The one thing that captured me the most, was how God gave this mother the creative ideas to enable her son to learn to overcome many of the obstacles that might have otherwise been life-long impairments. Bye Bye Balloon taught me as a mother to let go and let God lead me and guide me in my parenting, and the He is always there, and He really does love us ""all the way down to the sprinkles on our donuts."" I learned from this book, just like the Balloon, I have to let go of my own ideas, and Let God Guide the lives of my own precious children. It was truly an inspiration to read and I a pray a gift to my family in the years to come."
1,Disappointed!,I bought this book simply because of straight 5 stars reviews by others readers. After I read it I felt very disappointed!1. There are nothing new to be shared with others families with Asperger.2. Too spiritual! I am a Christian. But I feel weird that she mentioned God almost on every sentence!3. When did Andy Bondy change PECS to PEX?
2,Very basic,"If you are a renal dietitian don't buy it, it is very basic. It is good for patients as an information source, but very basic for the trained professional.I thought it could give some new ideas but I was disapointed. If you want to get ideas and new education materials for your patients try renalrd listserv, it's for free and people are more than willing to share their ideas."
2,Bad advise - good physiology,"The explanation of the function and disfunction of kidneys is thorough and direct - aimed at the general public. HOWEVER - the advise on management and what to eat is appalling. If you are truly looking for a book to help you get healthier, this isn't it. The use of pre-packaged, sugar-laden food items is abundant. The book actually recommends keeping calories up by eating pastry and candy. Not a good way to heal a sick body. A much better book is ""Coping with Kidney Disease: A 12-Step Program to Keep You Off Dialysis""."
5,Athena LS-50B Satellite Speaker,"I now have 4 pairs of these speakers. I bought one pair to replace a couple satellite speakers that had worn out. The other pair I use for listening to the stereo in the kitchen. These speakers are quite clear and transparent sounding. Even though I use them with subwoofers, their low end response belies their small size. The are excellent speakers and a very convenient size for locations where you don't want a large bookshelf speaker. I just bought 2 more pairs to use with my home theater 7.1 surround sound receiver rear channels. I'm sure I'll be very pleased with them."
4,athena LS-50B,the athena LS-50B satellite speakers have very good sound quality for such a low price.they have excellent midrange and highs.they make great surounds for music or home theater.
2,Bland,"The picture reflects a warm, coffee bean brown color for the jasper. I understand that natural stones vary a great deal in color, but the jasper (the largest stone) in my earrings was the color of oatmeal, with a few dark brown flecks. I can wear them with beige clothing, but they are not what I expected, based on the picture."
3,A matter of taste,"If you already like ""Barber"" you'll almost certainly love this one .. Bartolli is tremendous, which is why I ordered it in spite of not much caring for ""Barber"". Kuebler and Quilico are fine .. but ""Barber"" just doesn't offer much for them to work with. It really is a nothing sort of collection of odds and bits, some of which border on being tedious .. unlike the Marriage of Figaro which follows and is a musical marvel from beginning to end. If you're looking for ""Barber"", this is very possibly the best around, if you're looking for Bartolli, try Cecilia and Bryn at Glyndebourne for a real whizbang of a performance."
5,Harness the power of P.T. Barnum,P.T. Barnum was a century ahead of his time when referring to marketing. Joe does a fabulous job of giving the true story and how to harness or copy the power of Mr. Barnum. You will learn about marketing and salesmanship in a refreshing way that does not make P.T. look like a creep but respects him for the great businessperson he was. Be ready to take some notes and learn a bunch.
2,Not at all what I expected,"The book was like hearing a story at a party from some guy who can't tell stories. I was waiting and waiting for the part about the airplanes - since the title is about airplanes, the cover looks like it's about airplanes, and the editorial review says it's about airplanes. Guess it maybe should have been a bit more about airplanes? Maybe he should write a book about getting a movie at the rental store, or buying groceries. Could have inserted ""And this one time, at band camp"" and it would have fit in nicely. I would not recommend this book - instead read Hunting Warbirds. It's about planes."
4,Follow that dream!,"Warbird Recovery is a great, true story of a journey to bring some WWII aircraft to the US for restoration and display. This journey starts with Gordon Page's childhood dream of flying a Messerschmitt 109 and grows into a real life adventure.After the break-up of the USSR Russia was open for business with the West for the first time in decades. Buyers were looking for treasures and just about anybody was willing to take their money. As the author goes on his own treasure hunt for vintage aircraft he encounters the Russian mafia, the KGB and questionable dealers who always want cash in advance. Along the way he experiences the breakdown of just about everything in Russia. His focus on what he wants and a willingness to follow his dream when it looks like there is no hope brings the search to a surprising end.Recommended for high school, college and public libraries particularly where there is an interest in aviation and recent history."
3,a different Lee Michaels,"This CD is different. It is nothing like the first 5 Lee michaels discs. It is not a bad disc, but do not expect songs like ""DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?"", or his smokin verson of ""STORMY MONDAY"". If you can find it used, or at a cheap price, or borrow it and make a copy. As I said, it is OK, but leave it at that."
1,Going through the motions....,"I am a long time fan and have read most everything out there about Lee and his fights with the record labels.This album was a contractual requirement and not something that he really wanted to do. So he came up with a few songs and stretched them to the limit. Unfortunately for us fans that bought the records, it was a painful thing.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Get the rest of his catalog - that is much better representation of his work."
3,Leftover Reich paranoia,"THE COMMISSIONER is an adaptation of Stanley Johnson's novel. Here, philandering British government officer James Morton believes he's been banshed to a nowhere job in Brussels. His post as Industry Commissioner proves otherwise.Knowledge of a corrupt industrial power play involving a German outfit that manuufactured Zyklon B during WWII endangers Morton's life but he does the right thing despite threats, a failed bombing and a disloyal assistant.Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.(6.0) The Commissioner (UK/Germany/Begium/USA-1998) - John Hurt/Rosana Pastor/Alice Krige/Armin Mueller-Stahl/Simon Chandler/David Morrissey/James Faulkner/Alan MacNaughton"
5,"The BEST book I have read in years, honestly !!!","This book is so great, I got copies for all my friends.It is a lot of fun to read and to apply the keys.There is so much information and self-discovery that comes out of this book. I think is the BEST book I have read in years."
3,Life in General is better...,"That's right, Life in General is better. If you've heard these guys are a Christian band, you are correct. They are a band, and they are all Christians! They've gone secular nowadays. The main point, though, is that there are enough worthy songs on here to buy it. But they have gone soft since Life in General and I predict they'll be straight rock by next album. if you are a casual music fan, this is the MXPX you want, if you like good punk sounds, Life in General should be in your shopping cart."
5,This CD rocks.,"Every song is awesome. It may not be as good as Life in General, but it's close. ""Invitation to Understanding"" is the best song. MxPx rocks."
4,Very Harmonic,"These guys define Christian melodic punk rock. This being their 5th LP, their style hasn't changed much. Their songs continue to put a smile on your face! ""Teenage Politics"" is their best yet, in my opinion, but every one of them rock."
5,To clear up the meaning of the word punk.,"You naysayers, are the true posers. The wannabe do gooders that just starts hating on anything that looks intimidating because you believe in ""your"" way as the absloute only right way while everyone else is either being too stuck up with their music preference. There's a lot of people floating around the internet with this kind of mentality and it's these kind of people that put their foots in their mouths and don't want to admit it. Morons. This is a true punk CD."
2,Nothing creative,"I'm not going to tell everyone that this is a horrible cd and call the band sellouts, why?, because I'm not an idiot who hates eveything. My honest idea of the cd was that they weren't playing anthing that i hadn't heard on other punk/pop cd's although i am a fan of punk music, the cd was just too predictable. I play guitar myself and could arlready tell the basic feel of the song within the first song. Don't buy this unless your one of those people who has been led to believe that the only acceptable rock music is christian rock music because think you will burn hell otherwise."
4,Sick of sell-out talk.....,"Why do people always insist on labeling any band that signs with a big record company as 'sell-outs'? I'm so sick of this..., can't you all just judge albums on the music? All of this... about not being 'punk enough' kills me. Just enjoy the music, don't get caught up in the hype."
5,Going the Way of The Buffalo is AWESOME!!!!,"In my opinion, MxPx has out done themselves with some awsome lyrics coupled great tunes! This CD is definately one of the best I have come across in a long time, and I look forward to their next cd, I know they'll do it again."
2,mxpx is losing it.....,"this album is slowing going the way of pop. and is also slowly going the way of selling-out. some of the lyrics are emotional, i'll give them a two on that, but they left tooth and nail records for a&m. they have gained many new fans, but have lost some of the original ones in the process. i like mxpx and look forward to seeing a live album and a album of unrealsed and stuff off their 7"" records, but with them being on a&m, they will never have the same feel as they did on tooth and nail."
5,MxPx does it again!,"MxPx has really outdone themselves this time with awesome lyrics and music. This CD is a must have for all rock lovers, it will keep you listening and not wanting to stop!!!"
4,Not Life In General but Great anyway,MxPx's first album on a major label continues their string of great punk/pop The hooks are still there. The lyrics occasionally stumble compared to other albums but the lyrics don't stumble enough to ruin the experience of the album. Another great work from the best band to ever come out of Bremerton Washington.
5,"blinks new cd sucks, lucky i found these guys","I dont know where these guys are from(dont care)but they rock. Blink got close to their style in cheshire cat and dude ranch,but lost it in the new cd. One question, why havent these guys made the radio. i havent actually received my cds i order from mxpx, but from the samples i heard, they rock...cool huh!!!!"
2,MxPx punk? More like mainstream rock,"MxPx is one of the best punk bands ever. I've listened to them since Pokinatcha, and theyre next two albums blew me away. I had very high hopes for this record, but it came extremely short of them. Yuri doesn't do those really fast heel-toe beats at all on this record, which was a big part of what made them so good to begin with. Also, I didn't notice any religious references on this record. I'm not christian at all, in fact I'm islamic, but it was always nice to hear a good band try to push a good message along, and I don't think I heard any of that on this. To sum it up, MxPx seem to have lost their punk roots and gone in a more mainstream rock direction. It's a good cd, but is mediocre compared to previous material."
2,Somewhat disappointing...defintely not what I expected.,"The first two songs I ever heard from MxPx were Grey Skies Turn Blue and Wrecking Hotel Rooms and I completely loved them. I was looking for more of the same when I bought this album and what I found was all fast, hard rock. I bought this album because it was so highly recommended both here and on various christian rock playlists. Now it's not like I don't like this style of music, it's just that virtually every song sounds the same because of the same overbearing drum rhythm. I'm hoping that it grows on me, but at the moment I'm kind of repulsed by it.If anyone knows any songs or artists that are closer in style to the first two songs I mentioned, please email me at erpartlan@yahoo.com. Haha, don't worry, I'm not a kid, I just don't have an account. Also, can anyone tell me if the other songs in Panic sound anything like the songs in this one?"
2,Where did Jesus Go?,"Um this isn't very good. If you want to know about sellout then ask this band. Jesus takes backseat to a bunch of crappy girl songs. A lot of the songs or pretty boring. It does have high parts(I'm OK You're OK, Fist vs. Tact) but most of it kinda blows. Get Pokinatcha or Life in General just because they're way better. Just because one song say Jesus doesn't mean you are still a Christian band"
3,THis is a CHRISTIAN cd,contary to what others have said about the new MxPx cd it is religious. Even though MxPx does not come out and say live 4 Jesus they use some big termenology to describe their beliefs. I will admit songs like I'm ok you're ok have nothing to do with God. But you do have others like tomorrow is another day that describes how to live your life and mentions GOD. Overall I say this cd is alright. Secular fans will eat up!
5,Incredibly good MxPx,"This cd is almost as fantastic as L.I.G., meaning it's pretty good. I love the words, no matter what some of the idiots say, let's see them write song lyrics. And they are Christian, but that doesn't mean they have to sing about Christ. They sing about God now and then, especially on Pokinatcha. I like to see a band that can sing for Christ on some songs but isn't completely wrapped up in it to where it's all they sing about. So for all you critics out there, lay off until you are in a band as near as successful as MxPx and might know what you're talking about."
3,doesn't quite live up,"Time ""flies by when everything is okay"" and ""stands still when no one understands you""...(""Tomorrow's Another Day"")Just let me tell you, I am strongly biased towards the EPM (NOTHING compares!), and when I got SGTWOTB after that, I was disappointed with the content, although I got more into the songs the more I listened to it.The first 5 or 6 are really good, but the rest just don't live up. There's something missing (whatever it is, it's definitely present in the EPM!).I like the tempo changes on ""The Final Slowdance""; it's great how they can take a really short song with about 2 verses, play it a couple times over and mess around with the speed, and it comes out damn good.I also like the way they kind of randomly name some of their songs (""The Downfall of Western Civilization""). Check out ""Party, My House, Be There"" and ""Cold and All Alone."" I wasn't too impressed overall, but decide for yourself, I'm biased..."
3,OK,"I have gotten all of mxpx's cd's cince ""teenage politics"" and I think that they have talent, but they shouldn't be considered punk after this album. they should be considered soft alternative. I like my punk hardcore, and if you do to, you'll be a lot better off getting an awesome band like pennywise or bad religion. If you would like to get into hardcore punk, check out punk-o-rama volumes 1,2, and 3. Epitaph did a great job on these."
5,So much talent..its unbelievable....,This cd is so great Mike Herrerra is the most talented writer in the music industry...I think this album runs a close second to Life in General for the all-time punk rock album.
5,MxPx has taken Punk Music and revolutionized it with this CD,"If you liked their other CD's you'll love this one. It's perfect for all Punk fans, old and new. If you're into punk, you HAVE to get this CD."
3,MXPX IS COOL BUT NOT THAT COOL,"MXPX is not hardcore!!!! They are an awsome band, first and foremost because They are for Christ. The songs on the cd explain life from a Christian standpoint, and do a pretty good job."
2,mxpx has awesome music but are not on fire for jesus,"mxpx has become one of the most successful christian bands in the world(no THE most, but up there with the biggest). i've read some reviews you guys have written, and i just have to say that if they were on fire for the lord, they wouldn't be aiming for success. they would be trying to minister and witness to unsaved people. they are so gifted yet waste their talent on the fame and glory this world has to offer. i;m not saying they are not saved, i'm just saying that they are not good representatives of the living god living inside of them. your bro in christ, elliott eichel"
1,One of the worst albums I ever heard,"This is a poor effert. I'm sorry, but this album is a complete toss out. I simply wasted my money. This band belongs back in the early nineties"
1,Punk? yeah right,"MXPX represent everything that is wrong with modern ""punk rock"" (ha, using that term to describe this tripe is enough to make me laugh out loud)... complacent, rehashed green day melodies, contained and boring songs that all sound identical, and, OF COURSE, pre pubescent vocals and lyrics about ex girlfriends or hanging at the mall. It's ""punk"" with the edges dulled, ""punk"" that you can listen to with your mommy.Basically, the music is as contrived as their squeaky clean church club image and prep school hair dos. The fact that MXPX reside on an inpendent label is just a footnote attached to the fact they are interchangeable with the blink 182s and new found glories of the world....you know, once punk rock was about rebelling against the establishment. now it IS the establishment.welcome to 2002"
1,"Christian punk is not only an oxymoron, the music's TERRIBLE","Punk rock, from day one, was anti-religion in all it's forms. It was about anti-oppression and anti-control. MxPx not only embraces the fascist god in their music, the music itself is horrible! I'm not giving a blind judgement; I owned the CD. It got extremely tedious and boring. In summary, the CD is bland, the music is boring, and all the things christianity supports, i.e. homophobia, racism, sexism, etc. are atrocious. If you like the type of music, I'd advise you to support a band with better morals. DOWN WITH CHRISTIAN PUNK! Write me with agreements or hate mail."
5,Great CD,"This CD is great, I bought it last year at Wal-Mart. I haven't got tired of it sense. Many people say that MxPx has toned down with the Chritian Lyrics, they may have but I think they are a shining light in the world of Punk Rock, if you look at most bands you will find immorality and anarchy in their lyrics, but in Slowly Going you find great lyrics that are meaningful. They are a good Witness to a Lost World. These guys, I believe are great chirstinas. I like the songs, they all sound good and they have a long apeal to me. I listen to the CD regularly. Buy it, it's great. If you already have it try out pokinatcha, it's also a good cd, heck all of their CDs are good."
4,A good album,"While not MxPx's best, this is still a great album. My favorite songs are The Final Slowdance, Inches From Life, and Tommorow's Another Day, plus a few others that I can't think of the names right now. This is a good album for any MxPx fan, but if you are new to MxPx you should start with Let It Happen, or Life In General."
5,this really gives me a good sense of feeling!!!!!!,this is great!!!!!!i love every track of this album......
3,good ol' MxPx,"this CD is probably my favorite from MxPx. each song is catchy and i found myself singing along before the end of the first listen through! some songs sound the same and are hard to differentiate them, but they make up for those with songs like ""Fist vs Tact"" and ""Theme Fiasco,"" the latter which sounds like a totally different band. i'm not a christian at all, but this CD didn't seem to have god-drenched lyrics like other christian bands sometimes do. nothing new or mind-blowing here: this is good, catchy pop-punk, simple as that."
2,Dissapointing,"I'm going to have to disagree with these folks on this one, this CD is full of songs that sound like bad take-offs of those from ""The Ever Passing Moment"". I realize that Ever Passing came after this CD, but my opinion stands. I like MXPX but I thought this CD could have been a lot better."
4,NASTY,"This CD does the job . I wouldn't rate it better then LIFE IN GENERAL, but it is in no means bad. The Cd grows on you ever minute, as you tuck into the sweet melodies that make them MXPX. It's a solid effort."
4,One for the family,"Last night my 19-year-old son said, 'Mom, come watch this movie with me. It gets me every time.' So I did. I especially enjoyed seeing Hume Cronin again. His character was sweet, gently teasing Amanda to let go of her fear and to find a smile and a friend. I also liked the fact that these were not obviously 'mer-people' -- no tails or scales. The ending was happy-sweet-sad. This is a story your whole family can enjoy together. We did! (How many movies can you say that about these days?)"
4,"Delightful, Witty Family Film","This delightful video put smiles onto the face of our 4th grade son. I loved it for the wonderful humor which was witty and demeaning to no one. It is a current, upbeat film for the family, being intelligent, sensitive, and imaginative. We stretched out bedtime so we could watch it through to the end. Highly recommended!"
5,Good,"The book arrived on time without any delays. Arrived in the condition as described. Didn't contact, but I would assume that they're very helpful."
2,"ONLY FOR THE BRAVE OF HEART,","the movie begins by making the bearscary too scary, after about 9 minutesturned it off, will give it away, notsuitable for adults or children in myopinion."
4,Grizzly Falls,"Excellent movie. This is a great movie to watch with the family.I had my two grandsons over watching the movie. During the movie, I went to let my cats in at the back door and my local black bear was in the forest just beyond the back yard so I had to have the kids pause the movie so they could watch/observe the real thing. The real bear made it even more interesting!"
3,Unbelievable but fun!,"Suspend belief and just enjoy the scenery and the animals. Most movies are not really believable unles they are documentaries. I mean, really, how may nannies fly into London with an umbrella? That doesn't make Mary Poppins a bad movie, does it? That said, this is a pretty much enjoyable movie as long as you take it for what it is, a couple of hours of entertainment and then it's over. No award winners, no big lessons learned but the scenery alone is enough to warrant watching."
3,Two For One....,"I have always wanted to see this movie, because of David Duchovny and Billy Wirth. Now that I have I am glad that I bought this movie. I will admit that this is when they first started to act, but their deliverance was very well done. Billy Wirth's character shocked me the most, but you will have to see it to believe it. I wish there could have been more detail into the storyline but there was enough to know what was going on."
5,EXCELLENT Movie - Watch With Your Lover!,"Here is a great movie to watch with someone you love! I watched at first because of David Duchovny (who must absolutely be the sexiest man on earth!) and I was not disappointed. How my heart went out to him in his moments of pain in the movie as he retraced the last days of his ""once-in-a-lifetime"" love. The movie is a little on the long side, but I found it very, very enjoyable throughout."
5,Cool Pillow,The Pillow came fairly quickly and is just as described. It is well stuffed and works good on my hammock and stays in place.
3,Cellsuit not for the 6161 series?,"Don't be mislead by the fact that this item is listed for the 6100 series. It will NOT work for the 6161 series (Model with the keypad Flip Cover)The cover will fit the phone, but the cover will not allow you open the flip/keypad cover! Hence, you can't answer or make a call with it on. Rendering this cover as almost useless for the 6161 model.I found out the hard way ... Just thought I'd let others know."
4,Great original recordings,"This CD has a couple of great songs, but the best aspect is that they are all song by the original artist. Some songs, like Shakira's, would have been better if they hadn't been remixed."
3,A poor man's Apocalypse Now,"Bergeron's character Becket is tapped to take out a warlord who has gone over to the Dark Side...the warlord happens to be his best friend who has been presumed dead after saving Becket's life in the Vietnam War. If you can get past this derivative and far-fetched plot, the scenes in Vietnam, the action sequences, and Bergeron's acting make this an ok movie."
2,Pass this one up!!!!,This is a long way off from Sniper I & Sniper II. It is geared towards MOUT environments and nothing is very tactical in this movie. Keep the Sniper films in the bush and out of urban environments.
4,Bought for my husband.,I do not watch this type of movie but he seems to enjoy watching this series.It arrived on time and in good condition.We would purchase from this seller again.
2,Big Disappointment,"I guess after the first 2 movies that I had high expectations for this movie which it didn't meetI mean it's ok, it isn't necessarily bad but it isn't very good either - -the plot is totally unbelievable - and it's just plain painful to watchso there's no way I'll watch Sniper 4 - no way - if there ever is one"
4,Early Talkie Slapstick With Stan and Ollie,"""The Hoose-Gow"" (1929) remains among the best Laurel and Hardy two-reelers from the talkie transition. Shot outdoors, this early sound effort avoids the stage-bound claustrophobia that plagued ""Berth Marks"" and ""They Go Boom."" Stan and Ollie handle the familiar slapstick with gusto - highlighted by a messy rice-throwing brawl. No match for the team's silent classics, but undeniably funny."
3,Early L & H talkie is a funny prison-camp short,"Stan and Ollie's misadventures in a prison camp make for an amusing 20 minutes, with a raucous rice-throwing finale. This was one of the team's earliest talkies, so the cast members are ad-libbing dialogue as they go along (a charming touch for fans). The added colorization is very well done."
4,Unique,"This book is deceptively short: it can be read in about an hour, but you find yourself going back and reading its various passages and thinking about them long afterwards. Momaday tells a story of the Kiowa Indians by tying in three aspects: folklore, actual historical events and his own family history. The book's format underscores this, with the first, folkloric item printed on one page, and the historical and personal reflections in separate paragraphs on the facing page, all set in different fonts. Not meant to be a comprehensive account of the Kiowas, it is rather an attempt to express the author's own feelings and his own view of his heritage. In this he largely succeeds, as he writes poetry in a simple yet powerful prose form. The only shortcoming for me were the illustrations (done by Momaday's father), which seemed to add little to the overall narrative. Otherwise, ""The Way to Rainy Moutain"" is a very unique and worthwhile book."
3,Prisms of Perspective,"I enjoyed this very short book, but I actually didn't read it for pleasure. I used this book as a teaching tool in my AP English Language class. It worked very well as a tool for teaching students to look at things from multiple perspectives and evaluating language. They also enjoyed it as a work of literature while learning something about the Kiowa mythology, history, and culture."
4,Fun & Witty Romance,"This was a good choice to end the Flipside series; it was a light and witty read. Two combative coworkers - Madison and Colin - need each others' help to save their company from ruin. Someone in the company is responsible for embezzling money, and Colin is the prime suspect. As he works to clear his name, he also ""works"" as Madison's finance, when she concocts a scheme to fool her father into believing she wants marriage and family. Obviously, the farce turns into real romance for the couple. Some of the lines are particularly witty and the story overall is much better than some in the series have been."
4,Beautiful closet!,"My closet is beautiful and organized. I put the large Easy Track closet organizer on each 8'wall with 2 drawers and shelves. The whole thing rests on a horizontal metal strip so you do have to be careful not to overload it. I found this out the hard way, but I had seriously overloaded. With just all of my clothes, shoes, purses, etc. it is fine, but I had stacked some books and photo frames on a shelf and the whole side pulled out of the wall. It was easy to fix and I added legs on the center section just to be sure. Since then, no problems!"
2,Came all dinged up,"These shelves came all dinged up. They were mainly dinged up on the ends, but luckily the carpenter needed to shorten them a few inches to fit in the closet, otherwise we would have had to return them, they were really bad. We ordered about 10 of these 2 packs and ALL of them were damaged upon arrival and it did not appear to be due to delivery abuse."
3,below expectation,The external packaging looked OK but once inside one of the two shelves had a big hunk missing. I oriented it to face down but it was still disappointing to purchase a new product defiled in transport.
5,In praise of decent conservatives,"A polished political novel about the British Conservative Party (set in the future) from a politician who knows all about it. Two sound and decent conservative leaders (self-portraits of the author?) up against a Machiavellian and ambitious one. Ingenious use of the Scottish factor. Improbable family relationships, but a very good read, and should make for good listening, too."
5,With each book I find greater inner streight than before,"Upon the completion of each book, I find even more inner streight within my-self..I being a woman take these books as a learning tool and the lessons are greater in each new book I read.The streigth is very appealing & but the releationship is devine.. just call be BRANDY"
1,"Have not read it, may not read it.","I haven't read this book, and may not, based on my reaction to Kajira of Gor. Too much sex, too much hatefulness toward women. I would return it if I could."
1,Please somebody teach him grammar!,"Ok, I have to say that this is the most horrible book ever. I was getting so frustrated trying to find out where I was at in the book, because it would say the same thing every other paragraph!. To say that this book is actually literature would be the biggest lie ever. The whole first chapter accounts for about 2 minutes of just struggling and crying, then talking about how the sky is soooo blue, and then some more crying. It sounds as if the character has ADD because she keeps ""realizing"" or ""remembering"" the same things every other paragraph. Please, somebody tell the author to consult an editor before writing a book."
3,C+,"Decent enough read, but oddly enough, I think the books in this series stand better on their own, than in the context of the series, as there are too many repetitive cliffhanging themes... a lot of them involving ropes and/or nets."
1,Hated It!,"Wow, just awful. The writing is not terrible, and neither is the setup. But this book could have been so much more. The beginning tantalizes a glimpse into large questions: why are there so few planets with intelligent life? Are the Omegas malevolent or simply indifferent? Who created them and why?And, sadly, the payoff is never forthcoming. None of these questions are answered in more than fleeting, trivial terms.What is endlessly, monotonously explored is the target planet, whose inhabitants are identical to humans, to within an engineering approximation, in almost every aspect. What a monumental lack of imagination!I actually put this book in the recycling when I was finished. I am bewildered by the other positive reviews here. To each his own, I guess, and truth be told, I'm not a writer and respect anyone who can put together a book full of words. But yikes..."
1,Goompahs _ Ewoks... Evil Clouds and other Curiosities,"The plot of _Omega_ is fairly cool and the book started off very promising. The story develops quite well but then suddenly plummets into a Care Bear meets Ewok expose on a remote and endangered planet. The ""alien"" creatures, the ""Goompahs"", turn out to be cute, roly-poly hillbilly-esque beings living in a 12th century English settlement displaced lightyears away from Earth. Lost me there.I recommend skipping this one. Unfortunately this book was boring enough to chase me away after investing some 200+ pages into it. Only one other book I haven't finished in over 2 years solid."
2,A Waste of a Great Premise,"I only bought this book because it finally promised to reveal the secret of the Omega clouds. What a complete waste of a great premise! Although McDevitt doesn't actually confirm beyond all doubt that the ""reveal"" is indeed the truth, the idea is insipid, boring, a waste of something that could have been really interesting, and doesn't even really make sense when you think about it (SPOILER: why build clouds that zoom off course to planets light years away if you really just want them to drive to a certain point and explode ... makes no sense).Aside from all that, I found the characterization inconsistent, and frankly, boring. If you want to read something with real creativity and excitement, try something by Neal Asher or Peter F. Hamilton.This is the last McDevitt book I will ever buy. I collect SF books, and have an extensive library, but I can't justify keeping this one. Into the trash it goes."
3,"Good concept, but falls flat at the end.","This book, like others from the 'Hutch' series, has a pretty cool concept behind the plot. The Omega clouds are one of the coolest ideas I've read about in a long time. This book promised to address some of the mystery behind the Omega cloud, and on top of that, the book describes a newly found civilization. The book addresses these big ideas and hashes out a lot of details. But then the book gets bogged down in useless 'action' subplots, like when one of the characters tries to save an alien from drowning. The end of the book ultimately disappoints in how it resolves the issues with the Omegas. Again, the cool idea behind the book deserves 5 stars, but the useless action sequences that cause the book to drag on reduce it back down to 4 stars.And like other books in this series, I really think it's about 100 pages too long. Cut some of the unnecessary subplots, and the book could have been greatly improved."
3,"OK, but McDevitt needs a better editor","McDevitt's books are good, and I like this one, but he should seriously consider getting a new editor. I keep finding fairly significant errors in his books. For example, using the names of characters that were killed off earlier in the book, misspelling key technical terms that he makes up (""Fleckinger"" vs. ""Flickinger"" for example), and more. I know it sounds like I'm picking nits, but seriously, how hard is it for someone to just make sure everything is consistent?"
3,ok but nothing exciting,"Jack McDevitt is one of my favorite writers and that's why I was so dissapointed after I read this book. While it wasn't bad by any means it was nowhere near as good as Chindi or Deepsix or Infinity Beach. I think the problem that I had is that most of the book is taken by description by this alien civilization and how they live and act. Its rather boring and personally, I couldn't wait for something exciting to happen. I only hope his next book will be more satisfying."
3,Earthlings to the rescue,"Jack McDevitt's ""Omega"" is a clever sci-fi story about dark clouds that roam the universe, threatening to wipe out intelligent life in their paths. One such cloud has Intigo in its crosshairs, and the loveable Goompahs are at risk of annihilation. The premise for who built these clouds and why is a little loosey-goosey, but the plot was sufficiently intriguing to keep me interested throughout. One could argue that McDevitt explores deeper themes in ""Omega,"" like human capacity to help others, the perils of arrogance, etc. But I won't go there. I read ""Omega"" because I wanted to enjoy a decent sci-fi book. I was disappointed by the dialogue and some hoaky relationships that McDevitt develops. But the concept of ""Omega"" was interesting enough to warrant three stars ... and a trip back to the bookstore to buy another McDevitt novel."
3,Kind of slow,"Based on the reviews of this writer perharps my expectations were to high. The main idea was very promising, but the book really did not deliver. It has an awful lot of characters, must of them kind of flat. The best part of the book is when there is contact between the humans and the aliens, but there is very little of that. This book was not worth reading."
4,Way ahead of its time jazz-rock fusion!,"I first picked up this album in 1979 on a whim for $0.99 in the cut-outs of a Woolco store. What a bargain!!! Being a drummer, I really appreciate the intricate rhythms played wonderfully by drummer/percussionist Martin Deller. There are no guitars on this album (except bass) and any resemblance to one is really a mandolin. The Violin is brought to life by Nash the Slash and at times is haunting. Subsequent FM albums have Ben Mink (later to hitch up with K.D. Lang) on violin. This group demonstrates there is another Canadian power trio other than Rush, a favorite group of mine. Years later when I found the CD, it was nearly $22.00. The price offered by Amazon is outstanding. This album is a must for fusion enthusiasts."
5,Great Prog CD,"I really enjoy this album, but I am sad that there is'nt much available from this group. The music is simply amazing and I recommend RUSH fans to listen to the 3rd track, it has a few amazing drum solos. Once again, this is a great album."
4,Classic Progressive Rock,I saw FM opening for RUSH in the 80's and loved the sound of the electric violin FM uses to differentiate their sound. This disc is a fine representation of their music. Listen to it with headphones and discover all the nuances of how they combine sounds to create that classic overture rock of the late 70's and early 80's.
5,Prime FM!,"Just a quick clarification to detkoralph's comment about ""the late Nash the Slash."" Nash is very much alive, and frequently plays in Ontario. See www.nashtheslash.com"
3,Good prog style canadian band.,"I have been looking for this CD for a while. Maybe too much expectation. Their music is good or listenable but there are tons of better CDs to buy in the world. This band reminds me a British band called 'England'. Good use of early synthesizer. Solid drum playing. Kinda not-very convincing vocal. Not a level of master overall though. But the music of England is very very enjoyable (Strongly recommended. Imagine Genesis+Gentle Giant), excellent arrangement... I like them a lot. There are some other bands used violin to great extend. Eddie Jobson's UK and Kansas to name a couple. FM had a violin player but I couldn't hear anything exciting or impressive. But good music anyway. Just not special."
3,The Herd Has Spoken,"My ""herd"" wasn't half as interested in eating these as they were playing with them. They would put them in their mouths, but would proceed to spit them out and swat them. Go figure. Maybe someone else will have a more productive result."
1,cats do not like it,"I try to treat my cats with vitamins during the winter to avoid kitty colds, but I cannot even get them to look twice at these. They're too hard - not really chewy, and smell awful even to the cats! The only remedy for now is grinding them up while I wait for my order of Nu-cat soft chews (that the cats treat like Pounce).Not happy with this product."
1,I say this is the one to buy if U wonder what is Zorba,"If U like to have an idea about what Zorba's music is, or u are researching Greek music then u may buy this CD as a reference, but I have to warn u that the quality of the CD's sound is terrible, ,,If u would like to hear some great Greek music both some contemporary and traditional try George Dalaras and Haris Alexiou If u want a solid and sound advise whether or not to buy the CD ..I say this is the one to buy if U wonder what is Zorba's Music"
4,Review from Casual Fan,Traditional Greek folk music is a lot of fun. This particular CD isn't the greatest quality but it is worth a listen.
4,Authentic sound,"Okay, so I'm a very watered down (part) Greek (LONG story!), but while some songs may sound as though they were made in the 60s and 70s, the overall sound quality of this CD is very good compared to others I've bought of Greek music and even popular music.I bought this CD about five years ago, and I enjoy it now just as much as I did then for the main reason that the sound isn't modern at all, which lead me to believe that the musicians and producers were more concerned with keeping an authentic sound and not ""updating"" timeless Greek folk songs.I wouldn't call this CD the be all and end all of Greek music, but it's a pretty good start. - Donna Di Giacomo"
5,fills an important gap,"Although I agree with the reviewer who says that Mary Colter deserves a far better book, I still highly recommend this one, as at least it fills in a gap that's almost the same size as the canyon where Colter's buildings still stand today. More people should read it so that some will be inspired to write more!"
5,great song,Saw this artist at a flea market just yesterday. He did an excellent job performing and seemed to have a good time at it.
4,"Rock organ, the way it was ""back in the day"".","For me, this double-album reminds me of how concerts sounded in the '70s - loud, distorted, powerful. This album, recorded in a primitive fashion by today's standards, is a benchmark in the evolution of rock keyboardists. Bill Beer of Keyboard Products (LA) fame modified Michaels' Hammond to the extreme, as Beer did for most of the '70s rock bands such as Santana, Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, etc. No Hammond organ on any live album sounds better. This album is not one I listen to regularly, but Lee Michaels is on any top-ten list of rock organists main influences, whether they will admit it or not, or whether they even know it or not. I value my copy highly."
3,Muddy sound and no big hit,"What a disappointment. The show was recorded in 1973 and the sound is muddy-it's like you've thrown a rug over your speakers. There are no liner notes at all. Frosty has been replaced by an inferior drummer-his drum solo is abysmal. Lee sounds like he's had a rough night and the song selection is minus his ONE hit-""Do you know what I mean"". Pass on this one if you want to maintain fond memories of this early 70's fluke."
4,"wow!good,different and sad",this movie was wonderful!but it is defenitely a chick flick. i cried all through it!! you really feel for the characters...great acting
4,A fairy tale not a parable,"This is a wonderful heartful fairy tale, that is nonetheless, strangely moving. The problem is obvious.. Dead people do not, and can not come back to life. And broken dead bodies do not turn into mysteriously healed vehicles for any spirit. A genre started by the film ""Ghost"" has been carried to absurd proportions. But the idea of young life falling in love with the spirit of Death is fetching - if only to bring out the closeness of Love and Death, and also to describe the nature of love between the younger and older generations, especially within close (dysfunctional or not) families. Better than many things I have seen for months"
3,good in spite of Pitt,"As with most movies starring Brad Pitt, if you put enough real talent around him, the movie can be worth watching. As always - Pitt is very stiff - he usually comes across sounding like a high school student trying to read Shakespeare.Anthony Hopkins is brilliant. Aside from doing the lions share of Pitt-carrying, he makes you feel the urgency of a man who knows he is facing with his final days.This is the first movie I have seen with Claire Forlani - a wonderful talent with a face that will make your heart skip a beat.Just how does a being that has been around since time began not know what peanut butter tastes like this ????"
5,Easily the best movie of the 90s,"Meet Joe Black is an extremely well put together film. The actors in this film are brilliant and this is displayed thoroughly through their characters. The storyline was great and it was a truly amazing film. The best I've seen in a long, long time."
4,good but......,"well, i love anthony hopkins, brad pitt is okay. but the movie was awesome and each actor was brilliant! i really got sucked into the movie you laugh, cry and feel sorry for the older sister. it was really nice to see brad pitt play such a diverse person. when he plays Death he is very convincing and almost humerous in some aspects. go see it a must - yet you will leave with questions that you may feel have been unanswered fill in the blanks!"
5,Joe Black,This is an awesome take on how death and life can change in a blink of an eye and it keeps you guessing what will happen next.
5,GREAT HD,"This is one of our favorite films; a great movie, even greater in HD. Six more words are required for me to submit this."
5,miss virgo,I just love this movie so much!!!! The fact that it shows how you can fall in love with someone and it can come out in a really good light.
4,Enjoyed,Enjoyable and insightful. The ending was a bit puzzling and left small something to be desired. Yet overall I enjoyed and recommend this as a great to see movie
5,Meet Joe Black,"I liked the premise the acting was very good Anthony Hopkins is such a great actor Brad Pitt was, well Brad Pitt beautiful and a very good actor"
3,Just OK,Thought the movie was well done but just didn't care for the movie theme itself. Too many things that normal humans would question all went unnoticed by the people making it not believeable for me.
5,great movie,"Characters are totally engaging and you really invest emotionally in them which makes for a much more rich experience especially when some event occours around the main characters. The bonus version of ""death takes a holiday"" is also a nice compliment. Personally, I like the modern version better but that's just me. The older one is nice to watch after meet Joe black because you can compare them aand try to guess who brad Pitt would be in the old one ect."
3,Great Movie DISMAL sound mix,Imagine scenes where the actors speak in whispers and there is at the same time music playing. The music is loud enough where its impossible to clearly hear the dialog. This happens for MOST of the movie. Its a shame because the bits I could make out made for a good movie. This is the one and ONLY movie I have witnessed where this is occuring through out the movie. I am amazed that this was produced THIS way. Im sure the actors involved were furious with that result in the final product.
5,Perfect,"Nevermind what you hear about the length of this film. The beautiful and almost flawless acting on the part of all makes up for it. Especially moving are Brad, Claire and (of course) Anthony Hopkins. Not to forget to mention the music! Awesome! I would watch this movie over and over again. There is almost always something you miss that, when found or realized, makes the movie even more touching and awesome and you are able to appreciate even more the hard work that was put into it. Perfect movie for an evening at home. A true audio/visual conversational masterpeice.BSDj"
1,Your....Your....Your........Joe,"This is definitely the worst film Anthony Hoplins and Brad Pitt have ever done. The most contrived, stiff, pretentious film I ever saw. Yes, I sat through the 3 hours. Terribly cliched dialogue, and the daughter cries crocodile tears through the whole film. Brad Pitt's character is Mr. Death, and the film asks you to relate to and empathize with Mr. Death and asks you for tears during the Spielbergian violin well ups. Every tape of this film should be burned."
1,Bored to meet him,"MJB is so inferior even to the re-made-for-TV version of ""Death Takes a Holiday"", starring Monte Markham, that I can't pan it enough. The Markham vehicle had some wonderful moments when Death's imminent victim starts to realize the consequences of Death being ""on vacation"" - terminal cancer victims, torn by agony- unable to die.... the best MJB could do was to show ""Joe Black's"" fascination with human sensory input - the peanut butter joke becomes excruciating. I'm delighted to hear the movie died at the box office."
1,Horrible,"It's very sad to read reviews written by teenagers. Do you really think this is a great movie?! Brad Pitt is one of the worst actors in the world. Even when he's acting with a great actor like Hopkins his performance is always ridicolous. But, of course, teenagers that think Pitt gorgeous don't think that way. That's why they spend their money buying movies like this one."
2,"Overly long, bland","With two wonderful actors, I didn't think the movie could go wrong. Well, it did. First off, the movie was unnecessarily long. It truly didn't need to be as long as it is, it clearly drags in parts. I think if the length was shortened and some mundane pointless scenes thrown out, it would have been a pretty decent film actually. Now, the movie isn't horrible, its more of a snooze fest. Both Brad and Anthony give wonderful performances, as usual, but I just didn't feel anything. The movie is not really emotional, or dramatic, though I think it may be technically labeled a drama. It was hard to pay attention sometimes since parts of it were quite boring and felt unimportant to the story. This is one of those films that you wish was better than it really is. It has it's moments, but ultimately, its pretty bland."
1,"too long, too boring","To make it short, a plot with great possibilities gone sour. The actor's great performances can't justify almost three hours of boredom"
5,Classic Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins,"Like Legends of the Fall, this film unites Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, Great Chemistry! The quality of HD-DVD is almost always impeccable, unlike regular DVD's that vary considerably. I suppose it's because the manufacturers understand the expectations. Great music, great cinematography and a fun story. Even Brad Pitt's slight over-acting seems to work in this film. Well cast!"
4,Almost perfect,"What a cast! Anthony Hopkins his usual professional self and Brad Pitt doing as well. It would have earned a 5 star rating but for the times that the musical background overwhelmed conversations, especially intimate ones. Not a problem if one uses close captioning."
5,a soft romance,i only watched this because i was pushed into it. But it was a great movie. I loved the outfits and the story was sublte but fantastic. They really payed attention to all the details in this film. I truley loved the end when Joe (Brad Pitt) was looking at the fireworks. It was a true and heart-felt moment. I give this 5 stars.
5,This is a great little sleeper.,"Clever plot twists coupled with some outstanding performances. Brad Pitt is here for the ladies viewing enjoyment. Claire Forlani for the lads. (This gal has some serious acting chops!) Anthony Hopkins is Class personified. This movie did not set the box office on fire and I don't understand why as it is a true gem. Buy it or rent it or whatever, just make sure you watch it. Very Highly Commended!"
4,I liked it!,"One of my favorite parts of this movie is the scene where Brad Pitt's dummy goes flying through the air like a ragdoll on strings and parts of it are going in different directions from the other parts...they must have run out of money somewhere. They should have borrowed a ""reactions of the crowd"" scene from ""An Affair to Remember"" and skipped showing the actual wreck.Yes, some of the dialogue could have been tightened up, and some scenes cut altogether, and I think they gave my girl Marcia Gay Harden short shrift. She deserved better than that.But overall, I thought the movie sets and the actors were gorgeous. I loved watching Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt together, and I loved the sets and decorations. I liked hearing Brad Pitt do an island accent, too.This was a nice way to waste three hours. I'd watch it again."
4,"Great Movie, Fast Shipping!","I give this product four stars because of the case that this movie came in. Not an original blu-ray case, but one of the similar knock offs. The movie itself is and will always be fantastic though. If you are looking for an amazing movie to watch, I would suggest this one!"
3,What might have been,"This is by no means a bad film. The settings and photography are great, the acting, especially that of Anthony Hopkins, is decent and the story isn't bad; there are some nice touches of humor and a clever little twist just before the end.The only trouble is that everything the movie has to say could be easily said in 100 minutes. Instead it drags on for three hours, with long periods where nothing much happens. This is really self-indulgence on the part of the director. I'm guessing he was aiming at 'art' instead of the nice little story it should have been.It's better to watch on DVD than it was in the theater, because you can fast forward through the tedious bits. No doubt that is why it has been a bigger success as home entertainment than it was in release. Watch it, but keep that remote handy."
5,This film touches me like no other,"Movies like music and art are a subjective experience, so I can understand why there are differences of opinion. I'm a dance teacher among other things and some music makes me want to dance and some not. You can read all the negative reviews of this movie and come away with the idea that is not worth watching. I beg to differ. Watch this with friends and observe their reactions. I watch this movie every few years, and it touches my heart as no other movie has. When life is over I hope I walk out of it the way William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) does, and I pray I am escorted there by someone like Joe Black (Brad Pitt)."
5,SPECTACULAR,"a friend of mine told me a coupleof times to watch this film meetjoe black i did and now it's oneof my all time movie favorites.alove story of this type comes along very seldom,brad pitt whoplays death gives a superb performmance.he gives his character a unique sence of reality his ominous persona affectionate approaches some times fine humora shy presence at times and yet has a aura of sensual magnitude.great actor.anthony hopkins delivers a great performance as the successful business man millionaire who's demise is imminent and who's transitionto the other side is guided by brad pitt death.one of hopkins daughters claire forlani in the film falls in love with brad pittand wonderful moments arise through out the filmn. a great cast lavishly done great cinematography great all aroundfilm i highly recommend this filmfor your entertainment pleasure a future classic."
5,To hang on or to let go?,"The film is such a perfect depiction about the hesitation to let go or to keep tight the ones we love. The god of Death has taken the guy at the coffee shop away and he is waiting to deprive the life of the father. He even wants to take Jenny with them because he thinks he has fallen in love with her. However, it's not until he realizes that Jenny loves his disguised appearance but not himself that he decides to let go. Finally, he leaves the guy at the coffee shop to Jenny. Although it is hard to tell what is going to happen to the guy and Jenny, especially after Jenny knows her father's death the next morning, one thing for sure is that they will live together with unconditional love."
5,An amazing film,"I have owned this DVD for years, and just watched it for the first time in a very long time. It amazes me how this film moves you....it takes you in every direction an emotion can go. It is superb in every way, especially the acting, and after just seeing it again, I have to say that I believe this is one of the best pictures of all time. Kudos to the director, the actors, to all"
1,Meet Joe Bust,This movie was a true disappiontment in the blackest sense. Even the clever ending could not salvage this bust. The actual plot lacked substance but the subplot of the main character's life was interesting for about 10 minutes of the first three hours. Way too long to waste my limited time on. Just rent There's Something About Mary for the 40th time and your night will be much more enjoyable!
1,Felt like 8 hours,"If you like scenes where the characters stare at each other for 10 minutes while moving there lips slightly and tilting there heads a little then this one is for you. I'm not exaggerating, 10 minutes, maybe longer. The only real entertainment comes in trying to figure out what the director could have been thinking. There is also a section on the dvd where the actors talk about what a genius the director is and how all the actors they worked with were geniuses(Very funny to watch after seeing the movie)."
1,Appalling Hollywood Bunk,"This cloying, self-important, vacuous exercise in sheer futility is - without exaggeration - perhaps one of the very worst pieces of trash ever churned out by the seemingly-bottomless rubbish bin known as Hollywood. Brad Pitt's pretty-boy smugness is twice as empty as the plotless script - the guy has obviously gotten by a good deal of his life without much effort, and it shows in his performance, (a performance, which, might I add, received more than a few laughs in the theater during some of the most supposedly ""serious"" moments of the film). You almost feel sorry for the great Anthony Hopkins, who doesn't seem to know what to do with the lines he's being fed. I would rather watch Animal House II for 48 hours straight than waste another two hours of my life sitting through this one. I already regret having wasted 10 minutes writing this review."
2,Meet Joe Who ?,I have to admit I throughly enjoyed the first half hour of the film. The interaction between Pitt and Hopkins in the study was masterful. At this point I thought I stumbled apon a gem in the sea of melodramatic garbage. It turns out I was in for another disapointment. Does Martin Brest have to make susan cry constantly.
3,Fan of Hopkins and Pitt but...,"I'll make this sweet and to the point.I had never seen this movie until yesterday. I had heard some of the hub-bub when it first came out, skipped the theater release and never got the DVD (back then still had a VHS). The film starts out as a 5-star movie but the last hour was just painful. Why? Death never reveals himself. I mean c'mon! Although beautiful, did we really need to see about half an hour's worth of ""Susan's"" face looking lost and forlorne. If I were directing I would have changed the script. Death er... I mean Brad... I mean Joe Black would have wacked Drew, mr. death would have revealed his true self in some funky ghostbusters way, and you would have seen the look of horror when Susan walks a little further and sees her dad's lifeless body. But instead, she is smitten by Pitten and walks off in the moonlight. Give me a break. Death takes a holiday alright."
2,"Boring, contrived, tedious","Long, drawn out dialogs. Tedious and inconsitant melodrama. Ranks right up there with ""Legends of the fall"" for stark, empty performances. This is not a romance. It's just drama for the sake of drama. Devoid of substance, lack of palatable characters, dragging on and on. With no one to empathize with you are left without any payoff after having sat through 3 hours of drivel. A contrived speech by Hopkins in the last 5 minutes leaves you shaking your head and wondering why they even bothered. It was spurned at the box-office for good reason. No merit. Save your money."
5,Great Transaction,"Great Transaction, Very fast. Product was flawless. Will do business again with this seller."
4,"A ""black"" dramedy","That's the only way to describe this hard to describe film. Pitt is good, but not great. Forlani is a welcome site. Anthony Hopkins deserves the kudos.I saw this film not knowing what to expect. I wasn't disappointed. Pitt's sudden demise early in the film was a real shock to the system (the victim of a pedestrian accident, the scene of the accident is unexpected and shocking). I kept wondering how and when Pitt was going to appear later.Pitt, as Death, has some humorous moments as he tries things for the first time. Sometimes it works well, other times Pitt looks like a dazed teen.Hopkins does a wonderful job of acting. His character is prone to wonderful outbursts of anger that are ably performed by Hopkins.The film keeps you guessing and has a few twists and turns along the way. While some may not like the 3-hour length, it never seemed long to me."
4,Definitely under-rated,"I expected to hate this, and was pleasantly surprised.To those reviewers complaining about length - try getting an attention span - you'll find it quite useful. I read a book last week - it took me nearly 18 hours - that didn't seem too long.Shakespeare's plays come in at an average of 3 hours too - just because our soundbite generation seems to like its entertainment in little chunks doesn't mean thats the only way to tell a story!This movie is languid and relaxed, and manages to tell its story properly, because unlike most mvoies, this one has the time and space to breathe. Hopkins was great, Pitt was otherworldly - he's far from a bad actor (a BAD actor is Keanu Reeves - there's no comparison here)- I liked it a lot."
5,The best movie I have ever seen...,"I didn't even know this movie existed until my friend and co-worker, David, suggested I see it. Oh, my...was I ever taken and enthralled from the very first scenes! I watched it twice in two days. I still can't believe it is 3 hours long...it goes by in a flash. It is by far the best movie I have ever seen. I am recommending it to everyone I know. I don't even remember seeing it out in the theaters and I am shocked to read that it didn't get good reviews. But I look at all the reviews here before mine and realize that the critics must not know what they are talking about! This film is a must-see...and more than once!"
5,A film that moves me more with each viewing,"I cannot understand why this film has been poorly received by so many people. Perhaps I can only guess that at 3 hours many people are unwilling to invest the time, that the slow introduction to the characters and the rich emotional tones of this movie leave many people behind. For me this film has moved me in ways I cannot adequately describe. All I can say is that every time I watch it I come away with more."
5,Worth every minute,"This has become one of my favorite movies. It is a masterpiece in my eyes. Anthony Hopkins is the cornerstone of the movie. Brad Pitt plays off him like a master. Watching these two work is a treat and I think Brad Pitt will someday be considered one of the best actors of the 20-21st centuries, and anyone knows Anthony Hopkins already is."
4,"A good movie, freaky but unrealistic!","Meet Joe Black should be rated R. Dont show this to a 10 year old. It was very good, extremely powerful, but in a way too scary. I loved the dvd effect."
2,Way to long...,"Why did death have to make brad pitt get creamed by a car ..wouldn't his body be all mangled..oh ..it's Hollywood and they needed a big SHOCK scene.. why not just have him have a heart attack..so much of it is like this ..if Death is watching us why?? why is he like the Terminator when he shows up and can someone PLEASE tell Hollywood to stop making all their movies about Billionaires ..you want real love ..passion..family, talk to a post man or a cop ..Hollywood..BLAH....."
2,Excitement takes a holiday,"I recall a review from when the movie was released, stating that the director never passed up an opportunity to milk an emotion out of the actors. Having finally seen the movie, I understand what he was saying. Every shot it seems goes on for a third too long; every close-up is tight as the actors and actresses (fine cast by the way) run through their emotive ranges. However, milking emotions will only get you so far. At three hours it just got too tiring and boring. If it had been tightened up to 120 minutes, everyone, from the movie's investors to its producers to the audience, would've appreciated it more."
4,DON'T OVERTHINK THIS ONE,"Based loosely on the premise that the Devil will negotiate with mere humans, this story strains the limits of credulity at times (whether it is because Brad Pitt is an ineffectual actor or the role was absurd is not clear). If you are willing to let go of the fact that Satan has never tasted peanut butter and seems unnaturally interested in it, you may be able to enjoy what is a sometimes sweet and sometimes poignant film about regret, greed, love and hope. What more could one want from a chic flic? P.S. My husband wanted it for Christmas. Hmmm."
2,"Too boring, and long",This movie was not very good. Unless you're female then you probably thought it was awesome because of Brad Pitt. I figure the only good part of the movie was when Brad Pitt got hit by the two cars. That was hilarious!
1,Boring,"We rented this movie (DVD) yesterday and I was very dissapointed. I expected a great movie, in stead we got a perfect sleeping remedy! (I actually slept very well for the first time in weeks) Brad Pitt is playing mister beautifull (who he isn't) and the scenes are tooooooo long. The movie has no plot, you could have seen this one coming after watching 30 minutes or so. So unless you have trouble sleeping, don't spent your money on this movie."
2,Long and often boring,"This film was mostly lost on me. I enjoyed the Pitt character though. His performance is vague, and weird, aptly playing death and all. Probably the best Ive seen from him I would say. The score was excruciatingly dramatic to the point of almost making me ill. and long ? you betcha, we got bland and lots of it !I agree with one of the other reviewers here too, all the romance just distracts from the ""Ive come for your soul"" premise.Clair Forlani as a doctor seemed quite absurd too."
2,I Laughed So Hard...,"The only reason I was in the theatre was to see the opening day premiere of the Episode I trailer (little did we know Lucas was about to destroy his own franchise). We ended up staying for the movie.Which was a mistake, because when Brad gets hit by 3 (THREE!!! Talk about overkill!) vehicles near the beginning of the film, I could not stop laughing at the overwhelming stupidity of it. I guess the director thought so little of his audience that he had to really make sure you understood that he be dead. Anyway, I couldn't stop laughing, so I left the theatre.Any movie that thinks so little of its potential viewers that it has to drive that particular point home in that particular way deserves to never be seen, and I'm happy to oblige. Which is too bad, because I like the cast...even Hopkins, who has coasted through many a film on the stink of his banal Oscar-winning role. Brian Cox was the superior Lecter."
2,It gets worse every hour...,"Hopkins and Pitt are great...in fact, their chemistry merits a better movie altogether. The original was/is beautiful...this updated version is convoluted, misdirected, overlong and lost in some Yuppie-Vigalante premise. Yuk!Everything is overdone...the editing, the production design, the (groan!) dialogue, direction and even the hairstyles. Poor Continuity couldn't keep up with Brad's ever changing bleached bangs.Love the casting and the costumes...every suit is fabulous. Everything else...blecch. The most memorable moment (which should tell you A LOT) is Hopkins being led off to the hereafter with the witticism, ""Don't blow smoke up my as*...it will ruin my autopsy."" Egad! MEET JOE BLACK...the series!???"
5,Don't listen to critics,I gave up listening to critics a long time ago. Buy this movie and you will see why.
4,"Great Movie, even if too long.","If the movie wasn't so long, I would have given it 5 stars. It was still a great movie!"
5,"Pitt, Pace, Perfection!","what movie peacefully and lovingly moves through it's paces with such perfection? I have yet to see it's equal, and re-learning the affection for refined touch, facial expressions and smooth continuous scenes that force the appreciation of that sense that either quickens or slows the heart... perfect casting, cadence of humor punctuated with deep emotion, I loved this film and look forward to the next viewing....sigh"
4,Too Long but stunning,"I have never seen this before but having recently gone all HD I thought it worth a go. Well the picture really is excellent, just what HD was made for ie great photography.The actual film I also enjoyed although, at slightly over 3 hours, it was a bit of a stretch, maybe perfect for a sunday afternoon."
1,Full Disclosure,"""HD-DVD players only"" warning needs to be more prominent - on the image of the DVD case cover as it is on the actual DVD case cover"
3,Flawed Excellence,"An otherwise excellent DVD is spoiled by one major flaw. The soft-toned characters' dialogue in the last few minutes of the film is completely drowned out by the loud background music. A ruined ending of a really good DVD. There is one other minor flaw. When most DVDs are opened the menu appears before the main feature. Not so, here. To reach the main menu the menu button on the DVD player must be clicked after the feature has started. This is a minor annoyance."
2,Too Much Brad not Enough Bread,"The 2 stars I gave this movie was mainly for supporting roles and the idea of the movie, I thought they could've made such a great picture. They had the right actors and right idea but it did not come together as expected."
5,Love can be found even in Death.,"This could very well be the best of my top 5 favorites. Along with excelent performances by Anthony Hokins and Brad Pitt, and original idea that takes us away from the traditional love story can be found in this movie. Some lines in this film will leave you questioning everything you ever considered to be love, and make you will to risk everything for it. Gripping, and at times magical, Meet Joe Black is a movie for anyone who knows what true love is."
5,Joe Black,A fine quality movie. It is a wonderful love story and we watched it several times. Quality acting and wonderful visual effects. I highly recommend it.
5,Fantastic film,"What a wonderful film. Anthony Hopkins was fantastic (as one would expect). I don't really care for Brad Bitt all that much as an actor but I thought he did well in this role. It was a convincing performance that avoids the trap of becoming a heavy-handed morality tale. The humor was subtle without reducing the film to silliness. Authentic and touching (and very unfair to label this a ""chick-flick"".)Recommended."
3,Great idea for the plot but misses the mark.,Some people love it while others hate it because it isn't in the top ten best or ten worst movies ever made. It is too long and dragging and the Jamaican scenes should have been cut out entirely. Brad Pitt is great to look at but gives a bland performance. Claire Forlani's performance is believable and very natural. This movie was entertaining once but I have no need or desire to watch it again.
3,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Is it over yet !,When I rented this movie I thought it would be really good. I was wrong
4,a real 'feel good' movie!,A really cute movie- Brad Pitt (as usual) looks amazing and Anthony Hopkins is good too. Parts of this film tend to drag though...but on the whole its pretty absorbing. Great to watch alone on a weeknight- and if you arent into romantic films...watch it for Brad!!
3,Hard To Swallow In Places But Still Worth A Watch,"I came to the conclusion that ""Meet Joe Black"" was overall not a bad movie after I viewed it. The acting was well done. Both Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins did an excellent job. That aside though, the movie seemed to not make some since in places, and was hard to swallow. How could anyone that gets hit that severely by a car be able to operate their body like nothing happened? You would figure that the body would be too mangled no matter whose spirit was inside to control it properly. I'm sure I'm not the only one that thought about that. Maybe there miraculously weren't any injuries to the guy's body after the wreck before the spirit that became known as Joe Black inhabited it? Maybe Joe Black just temporarily kicked the other guy's soul out? But that aside, this was a pretty good movie. Worth a watch."
5,The Most Underrated Movie of All Time!!,"Meet Joe Black has been one of the most enjoyable movies a have seen in years. Though it was somewhat of a box office failure (possibly due to its 3 hour lenght and the wavering status of Brad Pitt), it has a way of bringing you into the movie and evoking all your deep and maybe forgotten emotions. This is a movie for a variety of age groups,a movie for anyone with a pure heart and a creative imagination. Yes, you will cry, you will laugh, you will hope and in the end you will feel free and rewarded. As I had stated earlier, the movie is 3 hours( like Titanic)long, however, you will never really notice the time going by. Hopkins and Pitt should get Oscar's for their performances. Finally, remember that not all movies do well at the box office. Some have a way of slipping by. This is one such movie. Try it, I am sure that you won't be disapointed."
4,Yet another film that should have been nominated...,"This is one of my favorite films of 1998. After watching it, despite the fact that I hated the remake of Psycho, I felt that Universal was wrong for firing Casey Silver. Instead they should have turned their attention to the advertising department. I watched the trailer after the film and saw how incorrectly the trailer depicted the movie. As for the film's length, I will agree that there were some aspects that felt unnecessary, but for the most part, the three hours went by quickly."
5,A Sleeper With Caffeine,"Brad Pitt plays his stiff ""in a body"" experience very well. Character development and plot very well done. I could listen to Anthony Hopkins talk for hours on end. Not to be missed!"
4,Meet Joe Who? Brad Pitt? Good enough for me!,"I've seen alot of Brad Pitt movies... but i have to say that this one is the best! Not just because he looks like an angel (when he should be looking like death), but it's how a love story should be told. A love story without fate is like Brad Pitt without his 'sexy' status. It's just unthinkable. I only gave it 4 stars because I watched the whole thing over a few days and it didn't effect me the way it should have. i had to watch it a over a few times after to remember the links in the script. So I suggest you watch it all at once! It should make some sence then! BRAD PITT FAN? THIS ONE'S FOR YOU!"
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen.,"I went to see this movie four times when it was out in the theaters and was shocked to hear it got bad reviews and low viewership. Well, each of the four times the show was pretty crowded, do how do you explain low attendance? Total captivation and the fastest 3 hours of my life each time I saw it. Tremendous acting by all!"
5,I can watch this movie every single day,"I litterally watched this movie for one whole week straight and no matter how many times i watch it, the ending always makes me want to cry and the relationship between Pitt and Forlani make me say awww. Pitt and Forlani are by far my favorite on screen couple.YOU MUST WATCH THIS MOVIE!"
4,Hopkins and Florani were great,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger, and recently got into it again. I love this movie. Anthony Hopkins and Claire Florani do an amazing job. If anyone was awkward at all it would be Brad's character as Death. It's not Brad himself, but more Death's character that is just very strange at times. The cinematography is gorgeous, as is the music, overall this movie can make you cry. A few low points, I didn't like How Bill(Anthony's character) had a favortism going on with his daughter susanne over his daughter Allison. Quince is a great character. The character Drew is a pain in the ass, but also very good. Over all, great movie."
3,"Good Idea , Bad Outcome...","Okay, so they made the plot interesting and different,and they produced it well, and they chose great actors for the roles, but where's the entertainment? This movie was dissapointing and way too boring to be enjoyable. This movie was PAINFULLY long. I'd suggest renting it if you really think it's something you'd like, but get ready for some major fast- forwarding."
2,"if this movie was so good,","then why did the director want his name taken off of it? it's ok, but at times, it's Really painful - brad pitt was horrible."
2,"Promising premise but badly written, conceived and executed.","For hard-core cinema fans, there may be something in the visuals, great use of sound, and art-film sensibilities, but as entertainment, 'Meet Joe Black' blows. Less fun than a visit from the reaper!"
2,It took a half hour too long to end!,"While it was a very entertaining and well acted movie, it was far too long. The last half hour is drawn out, which made the film loose its charm with me."
1,"Pretentious, absurd, boring, Pitt-iful!","An absurd plot premise, leaden acting from the romantic leads,long, empty head shots, heavy-handed directing, an utterlack of movement or action, even the romance is senselessand illogical. Positively painful to watch. A film suitableonly for Pitt-iphiliacs who can endure countless repetitionsof his two facial expressions - coyly feigned incomprehension,the dawning sly smile. Pardon while I puke...."
2,What Were They Thinking?!,"I was very disappointed with this movie and was grateful that I purchased it from a bargain bin for only $3.00. Based on the 1934 movie, Death Takes a Holiday, with Frederic March , this movie is pretentious, overly long, boring and even silly in places. Aside from a really bad blond dye job, Brad Pitt seems to sleep walk his way through the proceedings, (one wonders what the quirky Johnny Depp or earnest Keanu Reeves would have done with this role), and Claire Forlani as his love interest is bland and uninteresting with little or no discernible chemistry between the two. The always reliable and highly talented Anthony Hopkins manages to give his always stellar performance with minimal embarrassment. Aside from the 1934 version you can also find a 1971 version with the talented, although unfairly forgotten, Monte Markham which is still superior to this remake."
2,...,"This isn't as slow as the press reviews made it. But it is slow. I loved the beautiful cinematography and the beautiful Claire Forlanni. Brad Pitt seems like a nice person, so I don't dislike him, but I'm an actor, and I'm a better actor than he is, and I'm better looking than he is! (As monumentally conceited as that sounds!) And I'm out of work, and he's making $20 million for giving sub-par performances like this one. Brad Pitt is evidence that the cream does not rise to the top. Anthony Hopkins, however, gives a wonderful, underplayed, natural performance."
1,long-winded&boring,aside from Sir Anothny Hopkins who is the only true actor in this film this is a pure Vanity mess.Brad Pitt is way overrated.he doesn't add anything to this Long-winded&boring film.this is what's wrong with films today.only special films deserve 3 hours or more not movies that can be done in two hours or less.
5,Oboe cd,This cd took a little while to be delivered (a few weeks) but it was in excellent condition. I bought it along with another oboe cd so it could be that one of them was out of stock and they waited for that so that both could be shipped at the same time (which was fine with me).
3,Interested oboe player,"It is a fine collection of oboe pieces, and I really enjoy listening to them. The only complaint I have is that the case was broken when it got here (I'm not sure if it was before it was shipped or not)."
3,Bi-Polar movie,"(I give the movie 2 1/2 stars) The movie starts off as a relationship drama, then switches to slapstick humor, then family drama, then to romance, then black revenge comedy, then slapstick, and to inspirational drama. If only Tyler Perry had found a way to one down certian parts, and found a way to tie the humor and drama together more smoothly. Intead it feels like a confused mess, not sure at what it what's to be at the moment, a serious drama or a dark comedy.It's a shame it doesn't work better, because Kimberly Elise is mezmerizing as Helen, and Tyler Perry as Madea is hilarious. With just smoothing out the script so everything flows together better, and the movie could've been great."
4,Real close to a 5 star!!,"I was expecting this movie to be sooo hilarious, it would be what I would call ""stupid funny""...but what I got instead was a really good movie, with a really great message. I have never heard of Tyler Perry before this movie, or his character Madea for that matter, but this movie made me want to see more of her!! Colorful characters, that you end up caring about, really funny, and really touching as well. For those that are looking for something that has a great balance of fun and feeling, this movie is for you!!!"
5,6 stars,This was the first movie I obtained when I decided to start my video collection. Good casting.
4,incredible,"This is by far my most favorite Tyler Perry movie, much better than Witness Protection Program. Own it and will watch again and again."
1,Picture was so bad :((((,The picture of the movie was so bad ...and stop movie every 20 minutes ...horrible ..i am not happy at all
5,Taylor Perry Alway funny,"Another Great Tyler Perry, just good to have one on hand when you need a good laughReally enjoy it, plan to get a few moreJust nice when sitting around with the Girls"
3,Not as funny as some other Tyler Perry Films,"I love Tyler Perry as Madea. I've seen many of the other ""Madea"" movies...however this one isn't that funny...it's more serious. I think if this was the first Madea movie that I ever saw, I may not have wanted to see another."
3,My take,"It was good, not great, glad to have finally seen it, learned where a lot of the ""lingo"" I have been hearing for years was derived."
3,Not As Good As The Play,"This movie was not that funny as the play this movie stick to the plot and everything but still it just didn't have that magic touch. It was okay though, there was some good parts though. Madea didn't have that much parts in the movie then she did the play. They should of had the original cast from the play instead of the ones that was in the movies."
2,False advertising! This is not a comedy!,"After seeing the YouTube scene release that featured Tyler Perry I laughed so hard I had to buy the DVD. The DVD cover would also suggest that the movie is about Tyler Perry's mother character, and he (SHE) is the mad black woman. Unfortunately this movie is only 10% of Tyler Perry's gut busting comedy. The other 90% is a stupid ""relationship drama"" that wasn't worthy of a movie storyline. The ""mad black woman"" is actually the young girl."
5,Buy the Play,I was so impressed with the stage play that I would recommend it to anyone. The movie is ok. But I will not purchase it. I really enjoy the interaction between the characters in the play. As in most remakes the orginal is usually better. If you have the opportunity to go to one of Mr. Perry's plays I will be a good experience. My friend called me in Germany and told me she brought tickets and I was able to fly there to see the play It was wonderful.
4,"Funny, Real, and Sensible","I thought the movie was a good movie and don't regret spending my money to go into the theatres to see it. This is where it counts on the bottom line and in dvd sales.The movie was very reasonable. I really liked the part when Kimberly has her now crippled husband in the hot tub. That cracked me up. Some people say that Tyler's movies are too corny. I beg to differ. His movies always have a moral lesson that we all can take something from. How many commerical movies are good life lessons?I enjoyed Tyler playing the various parts. Like someone said, ignore the critics, judge for yourself."
5,My Orders,I am Very pleased with this company. It was shipped the next day and i received it in 2 days. This is one of my favorite movie's and it was in perfect shape and no problems what so ever. 5 stars!!
5,A great movie,Movie came in great condition. Wonderful to watch over and over again. A great Movie to watch with the family.
2,I've Seen Better,My thoughts on Diary of a Mad Black WomanAfter watching For Colored Girls the movie that Perry Directed. I thought I would give his other movies a shot since Kimberly Elise was in the movie her performance in For Colored Girls was so moving.I decided to rent this movie in hopes of an interesting story and extraordinary acting performances. After watching I saw the characters are boring and cliched. it felt like this movie is unorginalI was not pleased with the movie overall. I did not like the main character she was to weak for me. I did not belive her to be a mad black woman I understand her problems but I did not get anger from her character.I kept thinking about Eddie Murphy in the Nutty Professor films as Perry does play multiple roles in the film all I could think was Eddie Murphy did a better performance then Perry with that in mind i stopped watching the movie midway. since I watched half the movie i am giving it two stars.
3,"A bit melodramatic for my tastes, but still............","Like most men, I'm not turned on at all by melodramatic soap-operaish type stories with instant redemption at the end. Pretty much what you'd expect, though I was surprised that Perry's Medea was so foul mouthed and gangsterish, weed-smoking and gun-toting (as this is supposed to be a ""religious"" movie).However, I'm not as hard-nosed as I used to be about such things. It's comedy, and comedy is about humorous exaggeration of reality, which much of this is. We all know women who are prototypes of such a character.I think the film DOES however, speak to its intended audience, which is Christian-oriented African-American women. Many women can relate to the story about the ""trifling"" man, fiding love in unlikely places, and spiritual redemption at the end, etc. Most of us guys(myself included) are too cynical for this kind of stuff, but I respect the fact that it may be theraputic for its intended audience."
1,Diary of A Mad Black Woman,"This is not what I received...I had thought maybe I had made the error and accidentally purchased the play version, because that is what I had received. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift...So I'm raiting this poorly because what was ordered and what was received are 2 very different things.."
1,Tyler Perry Sucks!,I did not like this movie. All of these Tyler Perry movies and plays are really stupid and they are not funny. Why this guy dresses as an old lady is BEYOND me. It's weird and I actually find it boring. Please no more Tyler Perry.
2,Used copy damaged,The movie was great up until the last 10 minutes and it started skipping whole scenes. Because I had seen the movie before I knew there were parts missing. I believe the used copy is damaged. It was my first time purchasing a used item from Amazon. I was disappointed and not sure if I can return for replacement.
3,oh bless their hearts,"I am so glad that Rosa stayed on the bus, but ya know, pssst come here I'll tell ya a secret, she had a booty call at the next stop..as for this DVD, I think scared black people are funny. I think we should have more scared black people in films. I showed it to Morty, and he almost choked on his oatmeal that morty did."
5,Tyler Perry is AWESOME,"This was the best movie made all year. I initially was not a Tyler Perry fan. But my reasoning was that I allowed myself to be prejudiced without actually seeing for myself. I was biased at the thought of a 6ft man dressed as a woman.However, one afternoon while at my sister's I saw Diary of a Mad Black woman, the original play and have been a fan since.I was both elated and excited when I heard this would be a movie. Opening weekend I bought my tickets online because every showing was a sell out.I've been anticipating the release of the DVD since I walked out of the theatre. This is one of the movies that every black family should own."
4,excellent,"I just saw this terrific film. A delight of a women marries a rich but abusive lawyer, who leaves him for a younger golddigger. After he is shot and paralyzed, his new wife takes all his money and his ex is stuck taking care of him.She is at first bent on revenge--she chucks him head first into a bathtub. But she soon meets an artist who truely loves her and must choose.The plot here is not new or original, but the charactor delination is real--the jilited wife is someone we can empathize with no matter what our background. It is the humaness of the story and the way we watch her resolve her conflict that makes Diary Of A Mad Black Women well worth seeing."
5,Movie,"My husband and I first saw this movie on our satallite TV and loved it.We definitely wanted to own it! I knew it was an older movie so I thought it would be easy to find in the bargain bin at Wal-mart. No such luck. I checked with several video stores to see if it were for sale. They didn't have it either. I was ready to give up, when someone suggested I try [...]. I got on their site and there it was. I was so excited to be able to puchase it. I also orderd a second copy for my l5 year old granddaughter, when I found out it was also one of her favorite movies. I highly recommend this movie, and you can find it on [...]. Thanks again [...]!!!!!Gale ShubaBaldwinsvill, NY"
3,"In my opinion, the best Madea film","I got this a X-Mas present for my mom. I've only seen a couple of Tyler perry's movies but I think this probably the funniest one featuring Madea. ""Madea Goes to Jail"" was also a pretty good one."
5,If You Hurt a Black Woman - Don't Go to Sleep!,"After giving her husband the best years of her life, sacrificing everything (including family) and devoting all to him; he dumps you on the 'doorstep'. ""Don't get mad - Get even"". Good quote for this movie and the Woman WINs in the end. Get glad, mad & tearful all in the same movie."
3,Disappointed,"I had expected a lot more from this film after all the raving - however it was average. A good film to pass time with but not the ""fantastic"" picture it was put out to be. It is funny and will make you laugh - but if the point was to address serious black women's issues - the film failed."
5,Superbly Funny!,"This movie was adapted from the play, and it is magnificent as well. All of the actors were great. Mr. Tyler Perry as Madea, and Joe were funny. The entire household will find laughter in this movie. It is one of the family favorites in our Madea collection. You will sympathize with the characters as you root for them. It is a well written movie that many people will identify with.God bless!"
3,I liked it...,"but probably for the wrong reasons! If you want to cry,laugh,cry,laugh, and etc then rent this movie! Tyler Perry brings some of his point straight out in the open. The title kept me from watching it for a long time but my friend pushed me enough that I caved. I like all the spiritual aspects of it but like a previous reviewer, I agree, it did not go deep enough.I don't think this would be for children. It has some conversations in it that I wouldn't want my children privy to.A woman learning to stand on her two feet, finding love and then getting a little bit of revenge in the process."
5,Hilarious Movie!,"Madea strikes again in this great movie. Tyler Perry had a great cast. This movie will make you mad in the first 10 minutes! Yet before you know it, you'll laugh your head off. Diaries is warm and funny with real life situations. It will leave you thinking about life and Madea helps you digest down to earth common sense.I've watched this movie so many times that I should know all of the lines. So if you're watching this movie and the Po Po come knocking at the door, let them know they'll have to wait until the credits roll. If you don't know who the Po Po are, watch the movie! LOLTyler Perry, I admire and respect your insight and accomplishments."
5,LOVE IT! BUY IT! TREASURE IT!,"This movie was great from beginning to end. Madea kept it real! She is ole school for sure! She is my mother and my grandmother. A love story and real life events that I and alot of people can relate to. I can watch this movie over and over! The lyrics to the songs in this film told the story also. Great movie! I love it! I have seen this film over 50 times and the church scene in the ends gets me everytime! Diary of a Mad Black Women tells a a love story, fighting addiction, how important family is, don't forget where you came from and how you got there and most of all If you don't have anybody else you got your family. Last but not least Give praises to the Lord. The soundtrack is a must have too..."
5,I mean!!!,"This movie is about HOPE and I have to say, I absolutely ADORE Tyler Perry! He has the courage to write real, moving and uplifting stories. Its funny, you're going to laugh, cry, get mad, get even and know peace. Amazing. Will definitely be buying his movies. Thank you Tyler and God bless you for this inspiring God driven story!"
5,Loved it,It's a great movie. It has become my favorite movie. I would recommend this movie to everyone that I know
2,Tyler Perry movie,"We have enjoyed many other Tyler Perry movies, but this one was a disappointment. The movie was a video of a stage production. If it had been produced like the other films, it may have been more entertaining."
3,Tyler Perry will have you lauging till you drop!!!,"I just gotta tell you about Diary Of a Mad Black Woman the moive,it's so harrious, and more drama in to it. My favorite actor in the moive is Shemar Moore, and Tiffany Evans. Madea is so funny, and toucing in this picture. But I like Kimberly Elise charterHelen: beacuse she's got a divorce with Charles, and then Orlando and Helen go out and then at the end of this moive, they got married or get engganged. If you don't have this moive, wellbuy it or rent it at Blockbutser or something...."
1,it doesn't know weather it wants to be a comedy or a drama,"The acting was wooden. The direction seemed nearly non existent, or at the very last seriously flawed. The romatic lead (Shemar whatshisface) is a soap opera actor, chosen for his puppy dog glances, not his acting. He was perfectly cast. If you like black cinema's you will be dissapointed by this movie. The flick misses on all counts."
1,Diary Of A Mad Black Woman-Distasteful,"I have no idea how this movie can be described as funny!Woman thrown out of her home like a piece of trash-not funny. (Just for the record-she didn't clean, cook etc etc-you know all those things she felt she should be compensated for)Drug addiction- not funny.Blatant humiliation and physical cruelty to a paraplegic. not funnyAs a love story, the movie contains no sparks. The dialogue is stilted and unnatural,It's a cheap melodrama.A drag act, a drug plunge, a soap opera, a sitcom revenge fantasy.A film that's gone way beyond the realm of bad. This one's in the area of all-time grand mistakes.Just plain awful. If you haven't seen it-don't bother."
1,diarrhea of a mad black woman,"famous comedian tyler somebody pretends to be an obese, elderly african-american woman. what a hoot! put me down for two!"
5,Excellent Movie!!,This movie was the first movie I have seen in a while that made me laugh out loud!! A must see for everyone with great sense of humor!
2,Not that great.,"I have tendonitis in both hands. While this product is better than nothing, it really doesn't do much. Honestly it caused my wrists to be more uncomfortable after a day at the computer than wearing nothing at all. It's better to go with something that has more support."
3,Iron Eagle II,"Good sequel, good story and a little something for just about everyone (dogfighting, cold-war theme, hot-shot flying, good guy/bad guy and even a little romance to spice things up a bit -- Oh, and Sharon Brandon, well -- I'd fly with her!). The only thing it really lacks is authenticity on the enemy fighter planes; so, if you're a fighter plane buff, you'll recognize the enemy planes as good 'ol vietnam era U.S. surplus.Otherwise, if you liked Top Gun, you'll want to see this movie at least once."
3,Doug Masters Forever?,"I enjoyed this movie as a kid. I felt bad when Doug Masters dies at the beginning right in front of his friend Cooper. I love it that the Russian and American governments put together a band of misfits to take down the bad guy and have Chappy lead them. If anyone can do it, Chappy can. I heard Doug Masters makes a comeback?????"
3,"Not so good, not so bad.... just satisfactory...","The movie is nice but i like the Iron eagle (part 1) better. I have lots of disappointment to this movie. First, They killed Doug Masters. For what reason?..... Second, The movie used F-4 Phantoms as a substitute for a MIG 29 for the Russians. The F-4 Phantoms is very far from reality compared to Mig 29. They should have used F-15 because it really looked similar to the Mig 29 with double tail fins and 2 engines with large boxed type intakes. The least choice should be an F-18 instead of the F-4 Phantoms. Third, the ground support units used an improvised M113 instead of the russian BMP's as what is mentioned in the movie. This movie is fine but i prefer the part 1."
4,Iron Eagle maybe head of time,This movie taught that are enemies are not always communists. It was brilliant idea for its time. Yes alot is borrowed for Star Wars. But I feel that this movie made efforts besides the Migs are really F-4s and middle country had Kfirs or F-21s Aggressor aircraft being enemy aircraft. It isn't strongness story I had watch but this sounds like real possibly in the future cooperation with Soviet Arms Forces. It is unfornated that Doug gets waxed but that another film. It good film of this sort of Genre.
2,Not as expected.,We weren't able to use this one...too pop-culture. Even the younger people at our wedding thought it was too goofy to use.
5,Great Action Movie,Great movie with Anthony Wong and an all star cast about espionage and kung fu action sequences all with a great story line. If you like movies with Anthony Wong or the other cast members then this is a movie for you.
4,very good old school fighting,This was an above average action flick with plenty of high quality fight scenes. The plot was slightly similar to a movie on HBO caleed Safe House (featuring Patrick Stuart of Star Trek-TNG). Well worth the money and an excellent addition for martial arts fans. You shouldn't be disappointed .
4,Don't buy because of the title!,"House of Fury dosen't quite live up to its title. At its heart it's a family movie with special effects! It's not a bad movie! It's just good if and only under these conditions: 1) You have nothing else to watch., 2) You're entertaining children and you need something to keep their attention., and 3) Your looking for something to laugh at and also go to sleep with."
5,FURIOUS KUNG FU FUN!,"I'll start by saying that House of Fury is a very fun movie with some really great action. If you like kung fu movies with good fights and a decent plot, you should enjoy this movie greatly. I rented this movie when it first came out on DVD a while back. It must have not made a very good first impression on me because I didn't buy it. But recently I decided to go ahead and pick it up, and I must say I am very happy I did. This movie was a lot better than I remember it being the first time I watched it. For some reason I remembered the story being a little slow and short on action. WRONG! This flick totally kicks butt! I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. The main villain is a little lame, but the kid playing his son is awesome with a bo staff, so I can overlook a little wooden acting. All-in-all I give this one two thumbs up!!! Check it out, you won't be sorry."
2,House Of Fury,"After seeing Stephen Fung in Gen X Cops,I decided to see this movie.I thought it would be good since it was produced by Jackie Chan but it was not so.It was boring,the characters weren't that intresting and they had some ridiculous scenes like floating/flying from the top of one building to the next.It also has an unitentionally funny scene at the end involving the bad guy in the wheelchair.The fight scenes were also unrealistic and if this movie was supposed to have some comedic elements in it,I missed it.I'm also not a fan of that wuxia martial arts.Maybe if your a teenage boy or younger you might like this movie otherwise I say skip it."
3,Somewhat entertaining...,"This movie had some good fight scenes, but those were marred by the fantasy wire-fu HK likes to throw in their films nowadays. Gah, it's irritating to see some guy floating across the screen his legs flailing. I know it's part of Chinese fiction/fantasy, but people *can't fly*. Why do they associate martial arts mastery with having supernatural powers? Bruce Lee must be rolling in his grave.Wire-fu aside, some of the fight scenes were pretty good. The story was halfway decent, although there's a problem with the pendants the kids were wearing since childhood; they didn't have flash cards when the children were young. They didn't exist. That whole concept was flawed. The villian was lame. A vendetta over getting paralyzed by a covert operative. Why is it that they show the guy on the front of the DVD standing? I don't get it. Where's the consistency?I'd like to see more attention to plot and non-wire-fu action instead of a corny plot with huge holes and guys that fly."
5,Melissa and Doug Think of Everything!,"""We need to find him a toy that has door or hinges or something,"" I told my husband after seeing how obsessed my 18 month old was with opening and closing anything. I start searching on Amazon and lo and behold, the geniuses at M&D have exactly what I'm looking for. My son loves this toy and never gets tired of it!"
4,Good toy,"I bought this toy for my 19-month daughter and she likes everything: latches, pictures on and inside the board. I gave this toy only 4 out of 5 because one of the latches is difficult to open even for me! If I could, I would replace this difficult latch with the hanging latch with the key as my daughter is interested in them."
3,"Thought it would be a hit, but my 2 year old prefers the real thing","Our 2 year old girl loves playing with every latch, lock, buckle, etc she can find, and I was even planning to build something exactly like this until I saw the Melissa & Doug version and thought it was perfect. For some reason though she never really took to it and only seems to want ""the real thing"". So much for that...But a few criticisms about the product itself (besides my little girl's personal taste): A few of the locks require a lot of strength to do (too much for a small child to do without help). The buckle and the window latch are very hard because of how tight they are when closed. When my daughter played with it she would get frustrated by this. Other than that it's good quality."
4,latches board,"This is a great learning and fun toy, but some of the latches are stiff, and they are hard to move even for an adult."
5,board,Ordered for three year old who enjoys working with the latches and trying to guess what is behind each door.
5,Great puzzle for kids who are getting a little tired of puzzles,"My 3yr old daughter is tired of wooden puzzles, but she could (and does) play with this one over and over and over again. This is a good way to challenge her and continue to push her fine motor skills.There is something really fun for a little kid to be able (and be asked!) to do and undo the latches and locks that are usually out of their reach. The hinged doors are also a fun touch.It is definitely a puzzle you will want to sit down and do with your child since some of the locks and latches are not completely intuitive for little hands. There are also some spots where the lock/latch will prevent the the doors from closing completely if they are in the way (especially the chain on the slider).A lot of fun and a great rainy day toy!"
2,Not so thrilled,"I thought it looked like a great toy, but some of the locks are too hard for even the three year old to open, and one of them doesn't ""lock"" at all. I think it is missing a part or is defective. The children do not seem to like it at all, as it is frustrating, and the animals behind the doors are not interesting to them."
3,overprice for the quality,"Some locks are sooooo hard to unlocking even for adult! it's a good toy, but does not worth the price."
5,Latches Board a Superb Skill Toy!,I gave my 15 month old grandson the Melissa and Doug Latches Board after seeing him try to unlock the front window of his house. His inquisitiveness and determination to accomplish this feat fascinated me. I had previously seen this toy and began to search Amazon for it as a Christmas gift. He is now very interested in the toy. I think it satisfies his mechanical curiosity and is an excellent toy to develop any child's skill.
4,Keeps my 2 and 4-year olds busy!,Great toy for younger and older kids. Well made and actually kind of heavy. Helps with fine motor skills and also learning of colors and numbers.
3,Not for the very young,"Based on the excellent reviews for this puzzle I bought it for my grandson, a 19 month old and another one for my 2 yr old granddaughter. Neither of them are interested in it. It's quite a heavy puzzle and the 19 mo. old uses it more like a Frisbee. Not fun!To undo all the latches to open a little door and see a picture of an animal just doesn't seem motivating enough. Stick with the age limitations on this puzzle.Some of the doors have a tiny little crescent cut out to put a little finger in it to manipulate the door open. Neither can open the doors without help. One latch is way too tight to be opened by anyone more than at least 4 yrs old. I'm sure when they're 3 yrs old most of the latches and doors will be do-able for them."
4,My boys love it!,"Both my 2yo and 5yo still like this toy after a year. It has held up well enough and all the metal pieces are in working order. I do find most M&D puzzles look ""used"" and worn around the edges after a short period of time. This is no exception, thus the 4 stars. Overall I would recommend it!"
3,It could have been made better,"My Grandson loves this, only problems were the rounded part on the latch on the lower right popped right off. It is plastic and painted with brass paint and the perfect choking size. I think if it had been made of metal it wouldn't have popped off so easy. The other latch that everyone is saying is difficult is the other problem. It really is difficult to use so we will have to figure something out on that. We will also have to find a way to get that plastic piece to stay on and it will be a toy we won't let him play with alone since that one piece popped off so easy then maybe other pieces will too."
3,good and bad,"My son really enjoyed this toy, for the first few weeks. He loved figuring out how to open the doors and finding the characters inside, but being a rambunctious toddler, he also liked to step all over it, and promptly bent one of the hinges on the yellow house. (he's not that big either!) It doesn't close properly anymore and I can't even bend it back to proper shape with a wrench. He gets frustrated with it now because he can't close and lock all the doors. On a positive note, after playing with this his dexterity has improved immensely."
4,Great problem solving puzzle,We bought this puzzle for our two year old son and he loved it. The different latches allow him to problem solve while he figures out which one locks and unlocks and how they each work. It has been a great toy! Would recommend it to anyone that has a child interested in opening and closing doors and locking/key entry.
5,Open the latches puzzle,"This is a wonderful learning toy. Great for manual dexterity and hand-eye coordination. The grandson it was purchased for loves it and his older brother does, too. It's just plain fun!"
3,Not Much of a Challlange,"My grandson is 18 months old and loves puzzles.I thought this one would be perfect. Unfortunatelyonce he opened the latches, which he did very quickly,the novelty wore off and he plays with it onlyoccasionally. It is a nicely made toy - just not verydifficult."
5,Great toy!,"My 4 year old niece loved this. It's easy to think of games to play. We would take turns saying ""Find the house with the pony!"" or ""Find the house with the circle window"". There are great suggestions on the back for activities and it's a wonderful tool for fine/gross motor skills, colors and counting. I highly recommend it!"
2,"Not interesting, not durable, not fun","The quality is merely okay in a typical I-don't-like-M&D; but I didn't want to buy the nice one from Tag Toys which I probably should have because it least it would have a useful lifespan and not make it to the dump in 3 years. We bought it when DS was 2 he mastered all but one quickly and it ended up in storage at Grandma's house. On the plus side, if you shove it hard it fits into the M&D; storage piece with two different puzzle sizes, not the one with spaces for a single type of puzzle. And even with gentle play it looks sad with torn bits.I think something with zippers/snaps/buttons/latches would have been more interesting. M&D; also makes one but it has even worse reviews than the latches board.These are the Tag Toys ones: [...] In retrospect, the least expensive version also has a place to hide things that DS would have loved at 2 and would still love at 3. All there stuff is nice and can be resold or gifted. And it is made in the US."
2,Would only buy this for older or special needs kids.,"I love almost all Melissa and Doug puzzles, but I won't let this one into my house. It strikes me as insane to teach your child to circumvent all of the latches we use to protect our adult things and keep children safe.That being said this puzzle would be great for older children or special needs children who need work on fine motor skills. Still I wouldn't use it until your child understands and respects limits."
1,Puzzle,"Too boring for the average child. Puzzle pieces are not challenging, colors are blah and pictures are generic. There are many other choices to spend your money on."
4,Not as challenging as I expected,"I have a three year old and a one year old, both boys. I've been wanting this for my three year old for a couple of years, and finally got it for my one year old's first birthday. We have taken it in the car (quiet toy!) and to a company party to entertain the children. Initially, all kids are drawn to it. It's shiny brass, colorful illustrations, and unique function really interests children and catches the attention of adults. However, it's incredibly simple so children do not stay engaged long. I will say that I had no trouble at all with any of the latches being too tough."
3,Not nearly as fun as the defunct M&D box with latches,"I bought this because my 11 month old son had so much fun playing at a playdate with a Melissa & Doug toy that's no longer made apparently as I can't find it - a box with doors with these same variety of latches. It really engaged him for a long while. Unfortunately although this latches board is cute my son just isn't all that interested in it. He found it interesting for like 5 minutes. Disappointing. I guess it will be good for developing fine motor skills, at which he's already advanced, but I don't see this toy engaging him for long play periods. Just short stints here and there."
2,disappointing,I bought this board for my 18 mo old son and for my 3.5 yr-old nephew. Manufacturer's recommended age is 3 yrs+. The 3.5 yr old opened all locks practically on the first try and the 18 mo old opened all but 2 after several tries. Now that he knows whats behind each door he is not interested in playing. My son has a pretty short attention span yet and he likes being with people way more than with toys. So perhaps I just got unlucky with this purchase but my impression is it is not challenging / interesting enough.
5,great toy!,"My son loves this toy! He loves to manipulate and explore things and this lets him do it in a fun way. You do have to be careful of the doors though. If they get bent back too far, the hinges can break."
5,great toy for learning and fine motor practice,"this is a great toy for learning problem solving skills and fine motor skills. We love a lot of the Melissa & Doug toys, they are appealing to children yet educational too."
4,My son seems interested,"He's only one but is interested in the colors and latches. I am slightly concerned that the edges are a bit raw. Afraid of splinters, but none have happened yet. Maybe they should smooth that out a bit more. My 3 year old nephew enjoys it a lot, with the colors and numbers."
5,Excellent toy for your future locksmith,My daughter (2 y.o.) loves to open and close locks and latches. This board is well constructed and hasn't shown any sign of wear after 3 weeks of consistent use. It has a variety of locks and latches and should keep a young child entertained for longer than you'd expect.
5,My son loves this!,"Fantastic board for fun learning! My 2 yr old has a great time working the various latches, opening the doors, and counting the little animals hiding in their houses. Great quality and extremely durable. Highly recommend!!"
4,"Great for toddlers, not over 3 years old","My son received this as a gift for his first birthday. He was too youjng to manipulate the locks, but loved looking at the animals under the doors. He is 22 months now and has no problem opening and closing all of the locks. I'm guessing he will be bored with this toy in another few months, but has enjoyed it up to this point."
5,Great,Bought this item for my 2 year old grand daughter and she just love it and her 4 yr old sister loves to play also...great product and great service!
4,Fun!,"We mounted this to the wall of our one twin year-old's playroom. They're too little yet to figure out how to latch and unlatch thing, but they enjoy swing the doors open and close."
5,Fun and cute,"My two year old loved it. When he unlocks the doors, he loves to count the colorful animals. Great toy!"
1,Escape Artist,"We received this as a gift for our two year old. We thought, at first, what fun! Little did we know what was about to happen... Within a few days of playing with this toy regularly, our toddler had figured out how to manipulate the various locks on the puzzle and translated that knowledge to the SAME locks that we used on cabinets, cupboards, closets and doors within our home!! So in short, the same good quality one comes to associate with M&D products...but in my opinion, poorly thought out on their part unless their intent was to assist toddlers in their escape plans!"
2,rarely played with,"Let your child practice these skills on real items, or better yet, on this toy at daycare or preschool. Many preschools have something similar."
3,"Good concept, dangerous for little fingers","I bought this for my 17 month old so that she could start developing her fine motor skills. She is obsessed with the mechanics of the seat belt buckles, clasps, locks, etc... so when I found this, I thought it would be perfect and would keep her busy and intrigued. The first two latches are pretty tough to undo (even I have a hard time) and I'm afraid she might pinch her fingers. Because of the difficulties with the latches, she pretty much has no interests with the board. She likes opening the doors and seeing what's behind them, but that only occupies her for about 5 minutes and she losses interests. A good concept, but disappointed with the execution."
2,Just okay...,"My daughter loves doing and undoing latches. Although this toy does have those, the brass is rather garish and some of the hinges are really loose and/or too tight. The puzzle is really bulkey and heavy. So far, my daughter likes playing with this, but in my opinion, this puzzle is over priced."
2,Disappointed,Some of these locks are enough of a challenge but others just fall open almost without any help at all. The chain one and the hook and loop one never stay locked for a child to unlock them. This is too easy for any children to do more than a few times.
5,Great books.,These books have always been my favorite for an easy bible study tool. Recommended for pastors as well. Great buy.

4,excelente,"habia oido hablar de cumbres borrascosas,la buske sin exito en algunas librerias en espanol,pero amazon hizo la diferencia,es una excelente obra llena de personajes increibles k te van envolviendo en sus paginas sin tu proponertelo..es muy buena lectura"
2,La primera Catalina si q era una libertinaje,"Este libro me a sacado de quicio más de una ves los personajes son injustos unos con otros mirando siempre por si mismos son egoístas y interrumpen la felicidad de otros sólo por orgullo propio no me a quedado interés alguno en volver a leer este libro aunque se aprende bastante de lo infeliz q se puede ser cuando pierdes el amor de tu vida es triste he incomprendido toda la historia es bastante descabellada en fin cada quien con su opinión,,,,,,"
2,historia amarga,"Antes que nada decir que de las hermanas bronte el único que me gustó fue Jane Eyre a pesar de ser muy triste la historia, pero este... Primero, creo que está influido por la corriente realista de papá goriot y esos libros de temática trágica como si la realidad fuera solo penuria y tragedia.Segundo, las Bronte, Emily, Charlotte, escribían muy bien, pero Cumbres borrascosas te deja un sabor amargo en la boca, un mensaje francamente negativo y es una pena, no lo considero novela romántica. SErá un clásico bien escrito y demás pero no es un libro que volvería a leer jamás ni lo recomiendo para nada."
4,"Bueno, aunque algo lento","Este libro esta bien para el genero romántico aunque algunos capítulos un poco lentos, me doy cuenta de la poca libertad que tenían las mujeres de aquel entonces y que si se casaban y les iba mal o seguían con el matrimonio a costa de su vida o tenían que huir desterradas y nunca ver ni a su familia, se me hizo muy deprimente la historia que le toco a casi la mayoría de los personajes de este libro aunque al final se logro salvar ."
2,Ducati Superbikes 851/888/748/916 Paolo Conti,"Extensive development history of the racing desmoquattros with lots of beautiful and rare pictures. Written in stilted euro-speak; awkward phrasing and somewhat tortured writing style. Whoever designed this book should be shot. Very few captions for the wonderful photos, so you're left scratching your head and wondering what bikes are linked to what riders, what year and model they are, etc. Photos are not indexed to text in any coherant manner. Worst typography I have ever seen in any book; it is literally unreadable. If I hadn't received the book with my 851, I'd never buy it."
1,"Just an overhyped cat treat, not alot of vitamins in this stuff","My 19 year old cat will have nothing to do with these! Unfortunately I did not know the list of true ingredients when I got them, there are very few actual vitamins in this product and had I known the main ingredients are flour and sugar i never would have bought them. When I compared this label to her grocery store brand ""treats""..the store brand stuff was actually better for her! Dont waste your money, spend a little more and get a true multi vitamin product."
1,cats hate it,I couldn't get my cats to eat this if it were Kentucky Fried. Maybe it's just my cats but couldn't recommend it.
5,B-Movie Dialog makes for an A+ Album,"I know how the reviewer from Seattle feels. I to had a tape with both albums on it, and played it almost continuously. The music is great, and the lyrics are even better. Any fan of old film noir will enjoy them. Everytime I am in Canada I look for them, and at last I have them. Oh, bliss!"
4,Snazzy little case,Just got one of these to replace a worn out leather case for my Samsung 3500. This fits and protects better than leather but does not soak up moisture like leather does. The only part of the phone left unprotected is the flip (earpiece) leaving it susceptible to possible scratching if you bump into something with the phone.
3,CORNY BUT FUN,"Joan is a riverboat queen who runs her casino with the aid of political boss Wayne. I saw this movie years ago in California and thought it was corny but cute. Certain scenes are rather ludicrous such as the raven in the window foretelling evil ahead and the malevolent presence of Blanche Yurka as Julia Alderson lingers in the memory for her campy playing. Yurka tries to poison Blondell when she tries marrying into the Alderson clan, but alas the potion is drank by a family member and guess who is charged? There are several musical numbers such as Blondell singing ""Up in a Balloon"" . A harmless way to while away an hour."
3,AN OKAY FILM,"If you don't expect anything amazing, you'll enjoy this film. It's well-intentioned and could have been more, but it just doesn't have that magical chemistry that makes for a great movie. The plot is a bit hokey and predictable, but it wasn't trying to be anything more than that in the first place. Not a must-see, but a nice southern romance full of intrigue type of movie to sit back and relax with."
3,Mosquito combat Wings over Europe,Mosquito Combat improved the Combat Flight Simulator 3 operation a great deal.I do'nt believe it has the proper instrutions for clear operation.
3,not realy for kids,"This book, though definitely interesting, is not as kid-friendly as I thought it would be. Though some chapters are funny, others are quite disturbing and gruesome. It is also not very well written. The chapters are disjointed, different tales within chapters are not made to flow together, and the end simply 'ends'; there is no final summery, no statement of the author's purpose, no nothing. Though only appropriate, in my eyes, for children ten years and older, it is written as if it was meant for seven year-olds. Perhaps this is because the author was only about seven when many of these things happened, but still, he should have realized that the average seven year-old has not had to face anything near as disturbing as the things he recounts in this book! All in all, I'd say, if you're really interested in Vietnam, then read it. It will give you information that history books don't give. Otherwise, skip it."
3,The land I lost,Here is a book called `The Land I Lost' it is written by Huynh Quang Nhuong.Huynh is the main character he was born in the highland of Vietnam near the jungle. They were very wild animals. People train the buffalo called 'tank' it is the villages buffalo. They also trained monkeys and bird.I didn't like some parts but I liked other part of the book. The bad reason is the book talks about the animals but doesn't tell me about how they lost their land. The good reason is it tells me about their life.
3,retractable clothesline,I read all of the customer reports on the available retractable outdoor clothes dryers and picked the one that had no major operational complaints yet we had to replace it as the unlocking mechanism came apart the first time we tried to extend the lines. Shop at Clares and Amazon.com have been wonderful. They responded quickly and we received an immediate replacement. The replacement unit is performing as it should and is in daily use. It is a delight to shop with companies who stand behind their products and respond immediatley to any issues. Thank you.
4,so far so good,"This is the 3rd retractable clothesline i have had. Although it says it is a different brand it looks exactly like the other two (each lasted 5 years or longer) I have had, except that more of the pieces are now made of plastic rather than metal. This worries me since plastic tends to wear out much sooner. Very useful product!"
2,silly,"Its fine; though a board + a few hooks + some rope would have been cheaper and stronger and just as easy to set up. The only advantage this offers over that solution is that the 5 lines auto-furl up into the metal shroud. So if you're retracting it all the time, might be worth it; though its a bit of a PITA getting the tension right on all 5 lines each retraction/re-deployment. I recommend hooks and rope."
2,Could be made better,"I recieved the item pretty quick, very handy and it worked like a charm for about three weeks, the knob that locks the spindle, that keep the spool piece from retracting any more stripped out. Now, when you hang clothes on it, they wind up on the ground. I have notified the only e-mail address I got from Amazon and haven't recieved any response, If they treat me right on this I'll write in a positive review. I want to be pleased with this product."
1,Broke on 2nd use,I was so excited to get a clotheline again. This was the only option that would work with my yard. It broke on the second use.I am so disappointed! Not nearly worth the money. The line retracts into a jumbled mess.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME with this.
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"After only occasional use the large tensioning-knob coupling to the take-up drum broke. As a result the right end of the drum no longer remains centered in the aluminum cover. The drum flops around, scrapes on the aluminum cover, and eventually jams. Big disappointment."
1,Piece of crap,Won't mount or stay mounted on the wall. The lines don't stay taut. Throwing it out. Waste of money and very aggravating.
4,Excellent,"I've been using this for about two years now and this thing works pretty good. It's expensive and I would not call it ""heavy duty"" but it get the job done."
