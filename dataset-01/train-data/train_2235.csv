5,Dream about owning a Vineyard? Read this book now!,"One of my dream for this life is to own a great vineyard! This book teaches you how to start your own vineyard, how to grow many different types of vine grapes, and of course, how to make great wine!"
5,Great source.,"For an enthusiast or aspiring home vintner, this guide is of great benefit. Regional proclivities, trellis architecture, timing of the harvest, yeast strains, and cellaring are only a few of the topics of which a novice would have little or no knowledge. Jeff approaches all of these, and many more, in a way that is straightforward and adequate, only occasionally leaning anecdotal to remind the reader that what works for him will not, necessarily, work for you. It's very readable and entirely suitable for someone who has minimal exposure - say, a tour through a small commercial vineyard and winery - to an otherwise mysterious process."
4,Helpful information,It was purchased to help me with growing my own grapes for winemaking. The information was very helpful
4,Very Throiugh!,"Highly recommended, it covers everything you need to know to get started growing your own wine grapes to turning your harvest into award winning custom crafted wines."
2,Not for me,"This book would probably be useful to someone who would like to plant their own Vineyard!It has lots of information on when to plant,what variety of plant that grows well in aparticular area and a lot of details of a support system!"
4,"interesting, but not enough detail for the real world","Some domains are discussed in detail (eg pruning), others are almost left out completely (eg disease control (either classic or bio(dynamic)). Vinification is ok, but very little on 'corrective chemistry'. But I did like the book and I do recommend it. But it will make you search for more..."
5,Great Book,This is the one book to get if you are only buying one book. If you buy more then one it must be the first.
5,Super,I love to use this movie in my class. It is the best thing I have found to show 1st graders how harmful drugs are.Help!!! I need it on a DVD. Is it available. Will it be made available?
4,Dogon Speaks,"I haven't the time to finish this book, but what I have is worth every dollar spent for this book. Those interested in the Dogon Tribe must read."
4,Dogon Cosmology 101,This book was a great look into the Dogon Cosmology. I'm generally interested in African religions and often it is difficult to find literature in English. Good Stuff.
2,Void in wand gets dirty and gross,There is a 'sealed' section in the wand of this mixer that accumulates gross goo. It can not be cleaned from either side. Not recommended.
1,Broke after a month,We purchased this as a replacement for our good hand blender that died after mutiple years of service - We figured we'd buy something cheap to tide us over until we decided to spend the money on a Kitchenaid hand blender for the long term -Bad decision. This died a little over a month after we bought (4 days after our ability to return the item to amazon ended.)It was $19 wasted - spend the xtra money and get a Kitchenaid that will work and last!
1,"after a month I bought this, It doesn't work anymore","after a month I bought this, It doesn't work anymoreI want AS. I can hear sound It's on, but it does't work with blender."
2,Impossible to clean,"This hand blender does work effectively. The big problem is cleaning the mixing wand. The metal core of the wand is encased in a plastic sleeve. Whatever you are mixing finds its way inside the plastic sleeve. It is impossible to get inside the sleeve to clean it out. You can see the accumulated scum inside. It appears very unsanitary. I emailed Hamilton Beach about the problem. They never answered. The HB web site has replacement parts, but they don't offer pictures of replacement wands so you know whether they have resolved this design defect."
3,Good deal for the money,"The Hamilton Beach 59770 Turbo-Twister 2-speed Hand Blender, is a good deal for the money. This product will mix drinks, sauces, gravy, some recipes, whip eggs, blend homemade pea soup and a lot more. Blends most whatever you like without a mess, won't blend as a regular mixer, but does well on drinks and softer recipes. The 59770 does well and does it's job but, not as well as some I have used. It lacks power, and the blending head blade seem less than others. But that is compared to top of the line $50 models, for the price it does the same job and comes with a wisk attachment which works awesome, no more breaking your wrist wisking gravy. Works great to blend powdered drinks, like fruit drink mixes, and protein drinks. Easy cleanup, and stores nicely. Two speeds easy head switching. Overall good product for the money. Not sure of the life of the product."
5,Best Blender Ever,"I mix a lot of protein shakes as well as preworkout drinks and this is amazing. Super mixing capability and as well as easy cleanup.I was tired of constantly cleaning my blender, so when it finally broke I bought this machine and it's great. Mix my shake in the glass I'm going to drink it in, then rinse the stick portion under running water in the sink, and place the blender back where it goes, drink shake and done. Very simple and very efficient.I've used the beater once and it works well too, but I don't ever really need to use it, so I can't comment on how well that portion really works.If this ever breaks I will buy another one."
4,"Great ,efficient product.",Very happy with this product so far. I hope it lasts a long time. Price was good too. Would recommend to other buyers
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this in May and was very pleased with the performance and style. This morning I went to use it and when I attempted to use it, found water and rust in the internal cavity so feel it is unsanitary to use. I had not abused it, no one else has used it, and I did not immerse it in dishwater or the dishwasher per instructions. Very disappointed - I feel a thirty dollar item should last longer! There are no obvious cracks in the mixer part so don't know how this happened. I would not buy another one made with plastic. Very disappointed."
1,Nice set but cheaply built,"This set was quite useful the few times I used it, but it has a major weakness: the plastic of the blender attachment cracks after a few uses. You can still use it, but liquids and pureed food go inside and cannot be washed. Mold can build up inside.I will look for a sturdier hand blender now."
2,Didnt work out for me,"I really wanted to like this product, because I loved how the product functions! BUT! The blade attachment, which is the only one I ever used (for making baby food), has a problem where the gaskets in the shaft dont hold back the liquid from whatever you're blending. It traps the small amount of liquid, and releases little by little back into the next foods you blend, while rusting the components. Yuck!! Won't buy another one from this company. =-("
2,Not so convenient to hold,"You have to push the button all the time to want it to work. It has two speed options: low and high, but they don't differ that much. The low one is way too fast. Overall, not so good. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Exact replacement for my old one,I had an older model for about 5 years of daily blending my morning drinks. I finally used it for soap making and had to buy a new one. I'm happy with BOTH!
2,Overstated capability,"Underpowered.Underaccessorized.Too short for practical use.Operating speed too slow.Dual Speed . . both too slow.Switch position not ergonomic...nor useful.Shaft bushing too tight a fit.On balance, therefore: Over priced."
2,Cheap but works OK,It works and it was cheap. Next time I would buy a better one. My roommate has a nicer one. I use his.
4,Like it very much,"I haven't used this that often so far but when I do, I do like it very much. Easy to use, easy to wash and store."
4,not bad for the money,"i received this blender as a christmas gift. i, too, had trouble with the attachment falling off at first. i don't know why, but now it works perfectly! it stays where it belongs, has plenty of power to break up tomatoes for my sauce (i make a giant pot) and can whip up whip cream in just a minute. i was about to order one for my daughter and was surprised when i read so many negative reviews. my blender attachment is also plastic and i've stick it in my boiling sauce and and soups and have never had a problem. it's easy to detach and clean, the attachment is plenty long enough so the motorized part doesn't get gooped up. i've had it since christmas 2009 and have used it at least 30 times and i'm pretty happy with it, especially for the money..."
3,Has served me well...,"but it needs to be replaced. I've used this alot for everything from whipping a small amount of egg whites to making my protein shakes, to morning fruit smoothies to making creamed soups.200 watts is enough power to get all of the jobs done quickly and efficiently. However my only ""complaint"" is that the plastic housing around the metal blade cracked at some point and gathered water. Ive continued to use it even though I think its unsanitary. I am now going to look for an immersion blender that is metal or that is designed so that if it cracks, it cant collect water."
1,very disappointing,"I've been addicted to hand blenders for years. I bought this one when my previous, 6 year old Hamilton Beach, one died. Power level is just as good but what is this see through plastic all about? The first time I went to blend soup it melted out of shape and some shards came off it! I can't count the number of times I have performed this task with other blenders and I've never had a problem."
1,not durable,"I've had this blender for about a year. The attachment comes off while you are blending, and it has cracked in several places so that you can't get it clean (normal use, nothing too strenuous). I got online to order another one, and thought I'd say why."
4,nice hand blender,I got this same blender with 3 attachments and a storage box at walmart 8 months back for $24. Its still there...the stirrer is the 3rd attachment...first of all..this works great..i use it almost every other day...the only problem which is ignored by the company is there is no container provided to do all the whisking and blending....and since the blending attachment is plastic u cant use it directly in heat.Myself and my friend got this the same time...hers is dead now...i think when mine dies ill get one with a chopper and more attachements..UPDATEThe shaft and whisk of my blender broke and when i called the company they told me the warranty is only for the motor...not just that even if i had to order the same from them including the shipping is as good as gettin a new one...No more hamilton beach hand blenders for me...for just 6 months lifespan..its not that cheap.
5,Birthday memory of a lifetime,"When I was 12, my father asked me what I wanted for my birthday,and I said ""Nothing...just a cake"" and he went to Grandma Rose's book, and chose a mocha cake recipe that used a dozen eggs! The cake was giagantic and delicious. 28 years later I still remember how good it tasted!"
5,amazing!!!,"i just recieved the cone maker and i found a great recipe online. This gadget is the best it only took me 2 tries to get it right!! i made so many in so little time, everyone in my house loves it. and i bought an ice cream maker as well to go along with it :)"
1,I love this line but not this product,"African America, 4c, relaxed girl.This does literally nothing to my hair. Absolutely nothing at all, which I find weird because theoretically it should do *something*. Anyway, I use honey as a pre-poo or added to my DC [adds major shine and softness] once a week on wash day, and I deep condition and co-wash regularly, so maybe it just does not work because I already have the level of shine it would impart if I did not do those things? Perhaps I expected it to be more like a salon style shine than the sort of healthy glow you get from honey and regular DC/baggying?Anyway, I'm sure this works for loads of people, but if you're already doing other stuff to give your hair shine like closing cuticles and adding your own concoctions to your dc, this probably won't add much to that."
5,love! love! love!,this product is awesome. it keeps my hair feeling soft and shiny without being greasy! It is also a great frizz-buster. my hair is shiny and bouncy after i use this product. love it!
3,Oldies for my mom,"The CD is ok, I bought it for my mom and she really liked it; I'd just wish for the disc to have better covers and, maybe, a booklet with the lyrics."
1,Misleading title - this is a class for children,"I am sure that Master Ted Gambordella is an excellent practitioner. But this is not up to the standard of the other Kobudo video offered on Amazon.com. Most of which I have purchased and studied. I really wish I could get my money back. This is a video of a teacher and his class of kids learning the tonfa without much editing. There is not a traditional kata to be learned here if you are looking for that. You will not have the tools to ""Master the Tonfa"" with this video"
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I had Flash and the Pan on vinyl back in the... 80's and I liked that it was different than most stuff and had a decent recording. I am not sure this was the album that I had in the 80's but this has only one good song on it IMO. Midnight Man is good... it seems to me that Early Morning Wake Up Call was a good cut but not feeling it now. Even though I am not totally anti-80's this CD highlights the what many can't stand about the 80's.I may have gotten the wrong CD but Midnight Man was on the album I had back in the 80's... the rest I don't really recognize, maybe my tastes have changed some too."
1,Shameless propaganda,"Classic anti-American, self hating propaganda that gleefully portrays Marines as robotic killing machines. Not terribly surprising given the director's past body of work. This movie belongs in the same class as Michael Moore's files, fiction masquerading as documentary. The actors however, did a magnificent job. Especially noteworthy is the performance of Elliot Ruiz as a troubled Corporal."
1,A gross misrepresentation of the truth,"Clearly no subject matter expert was consulted in the making of this piece of garbage. Broomfield has NO CLUE about Marine Corps policy or protocol in combat operations. I am truly disgusted with this unreal portrayal of US Marines. Broomfield seems to think that any group of cussing aggressive young men can adequately portray Marines. Reality aside, the direction and dialogue are weak. This malicious propaganda is criminal."
1,Complete anti American and anti Marine Corps garbage,This movie is just another anti-American propaganda film. It is completely despicable.I also wonder how the actors agreed to play in this movie. Completely pathetic.
1,AMATEUR PROPAGANDA!,"Best to keep it direct and succinct. It's not enough that the film is blatant, obvious anti-American propaganda, but it is primarily a lousy movie.To have the blurb on the DVD cover, ""There will be no better film about war"", is a slap in the face of real filmmakers like Steven SpielbergSaving Private Ryan (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)andSchindler's List (Widescreen Edition), and Stanley KubrickPaths of GloryandFull Metal Jacket.This Nick Broomfield - whoever he is - is a rank amateur not fit to hold a real filmmaker's camera."
1,Just more Hollywood Propoganda,"Ok we get it, Hollywood hates the military and the Iraqi war. This lame attempt at telling the ""true"" story of ""real"" events is predictable and oh so tiring. You got your stereotypical dumb jarheads, your incompetent leaders, the unprofessional behavior, and of course the massacre. Yawn.... don't bother watching this movie. It has zero redeeming value and you'll never get those 90 minutes back. Anti-american propaganda at its finest. Funny thing is, real Marines are fighting and dying for the right to publish this crap. Thank a vet but don't give Hollywood propagandists your time or money by watching this movie."
1,Battle of Haditha,The movie was lame to say the least-No mention of what lead up to the killings-no mention of the marines killed in this Battle-antiamerican film-disgrace to our military-Hated this film-
2,A bit overpriced and too small,"This hat is solid but cheaply made. The material is stiff and does not stretch at all - like hard cardboard with a layer of felt over it. That is fine for a costume hat, but the price is too high for what it is. I've got a big head so I knew I was taking a chance with a ""one size fits most"" hat. It was impossibly small for me and no amount of stretching (or even making small cuts) would make it fit. It did fit most of my friends though."
1,"Poor quality, doesn't fit","This hat does not fit my male, adult head (approx a hat size 7 1/2). The quality is poor, as expected for a costume hat. However, considering the fact that I will have to cut this to get it to fit and the overall knock-off quality of the build, I would not have paid more than $9.99 after shipping. Instead, I'm out $24. This hat is useless. I've decided to be S01E01 Walter White instead of season 5 Heisenberg because of the lack of a decent hat."
1,Written for Younger Minds,"I picked up this book one day when I was looking for something to read at work in a classroom. I think that it has an interesting story but is poorly written. I feel like the author was too worried about sounding ""cool"" and ""hip"" that the story lacked clarity. Overall, a good read for VERY young adults."
4,Very good...,"In a market where there are so few African-American teen novels, Jason & Kyra is a welcome sight. I loved and cared about the characters. I'd like to read more from Dana Davidson and others like her of this genre in the future."
3,great book!!!,"I actually purchased this book for my 16 year old daughter who was recluctant to read it. She finished the book in two days, that piqued my interest. I was surprised at how well this book was written. Good Debut"
4,Dana Davidson's First Book,"I think that Jason and Kyra is a great book.If this is her first book then her second should be fabulous and phenomenal. It is a book proving the classic saying ""Opposites Attract"". The destined loves are Jason,a sports teen and Kyra, a smart girl. They fall in love, to the dissapointment of friends and the ex of Jason, all the while desperately trying to get him back. A nice insight on teen thoughts and love. 4 stars!"
2,Not his best work.,"Snow White and the Seven Samurai starts out with a great premise--all your favorite fairy tales get mixed around--but then does not deliver. There are a lot of characters in the book who do not act like their tales are mixed up. You expect them to be the opposite of the way they are in the real tale, but instead they fall somewhere in between. Characters are added that have nothing to do with fairy tales. While there are some truly clever and funny parts, all in all the book is kind of a hodgepodge of fairy tales and mixed up fairy tales and just regular fiction-writing. For true Holt humor, stick with Expecting Someone Taller or Flying Dutchman."
2,No the best Tom Holt I have read,"Having been a fan for many years, I found it a disappointing, convoluted read. A great idea gone a little too clever, and therefore got lost in itself."
4,A Little Confusing.,"OK, many of Mr. Holt's books are hard to follow, this one was perhaps even a little harder due to the parallel stories. I really did like the idea of a Mirrors computer operating system though :-)"
2,i hated this book,"Bought this book just outside Sir Walter Scott's tower in Edinburgh as a travel book. Though I made it to the end, I consider that a major accomplishment that I survived the effort.I loved fantasy books, but this book caused considerable agony to read. And I'm at pains to describe just why. Mr Holt is a highly skilled writer so I can't put it down to the work of a bad writer.I want to say it's because the book violates its internal logic. By that I mean that any novel that works has a framework of rules that it follows. This book seems to take the tack that anything can happen as it's just a story. In doing that, I felt I had no ledge to rest on.Holt definitely isn't a writer for me. I'd run in fear if anyone tried to push another of his books in my hands. However, I acknowledge the skill of the writer and am sure he has an audience as long as they can be find with an anything goes environment."
2,adventures of tom sawyer and adventures of huckleberry finn,i did not like the book adventures of tom sawyer because i thought the book was to slow. they would carry on and on about things that were not that important. in my opinion i think that junior high kids should read this book. i thought that the book was like a roller coaster because one chapter you start getting to the climax and it just turns on you and goes to something differnt that is not even involved in thier adventure.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought these lens awhile ago for my Canon, we did get an adaptor to the wide lens (my camera and the lens is black but the ring was silver) the lens are no good, all my photos are grainy and have a blue tint to them. I can't even give these lenses away so I think they may find the garabage can. Definitly not worth it, I wouldn't even give these one star, no stars is better"
3,Carrie Lucas Greatest Hits,"This cd was just what I expected. The Song I really wanted to add to my collection was her version of the Barbara Lynn Song ""Hello Stranger"". I would buy it again."
3,"Hello Stranger with The Whispers, her best work","Carrie Lucas sings Hello Stranger with The Whispers, and you will know why they picked her to team up with. She showcases all of her singing talent and ability on this song made famous by, Barbara Lewis. I normally don't care a lot for a song made famous by an original artist, and sung by another artist, but Carrie Lucas puts in the work on Hello Stranger. This version of the song should have been put out back in the 1960's, and Barbara Lewis would have had a run for the money. The other songs on the album are okay, and sound pretty good, and some of the songs have a disco flair to them. I would probably buy this album again."
3,Interesting...,"Interesting but significantly watered-down version of the claustrophobic, searing stage play concerning the sexual liaisons between young men in a juvenile prison. While the film is essentially explotative in tone, and comes no where near depicting the brutality of the prison system, it raises a number of legitimate issues and questions re homosexuality in prison and sexual role-playing in gay society. No laurels for the script, but the performers are strong and the film itself well-made. Not wildly memorable, but worth a watch."
3,"Great system, but (new?) bottles DO NOT fit on the Ameda Purely Yours","I purchased this set in Sept 2012. The rack is great for organizing pumped milk in the fridge, but it seems that they've changed the bottles: mine have white caps, not pink, and they don't screw onto my Ameda Purely Yours pump (many reviews here state that they do fit onto this and other pumps). This makes it a hassle to pump, because I have to transfer milk between bottles. I also find that the milkfat sticks to the insides of these bottles more than it does in my Ameda bottles -- not matter how hard I shake the bottle, there's still some stuff stuck on the insides. Annoying. I ended up buying these:Ameda 4 Pack Breast Milk Storage Bottles, 4 Ounce."
5,Great Idea,"This is the perfect thing for a mom who plans on storing ANY breast milk. I ended up buying 2 sets for my freezer and a case of extra bottles. I have not returned to work yet, and I have a good supply saved up for daycare. I wish I would have had this product with my other 2 children."
5,Great System!,"These are great little bottles and a super system for storing your breastmilk! The only drawback is that I've had some of the lids crack when I've dropped them (NO MILK LEAKED THOUGH!) and you can't purchase lids separately.Update: I've been exclusively pumping for 6 months and these are the first bottles I reach for, above Medela & Evenflo. The Evenflo plastic bottles leak when you shake up the milk and the Medela bottles don't fit into the storage rack that I love. Also, the customer service is GREAT! I emailed them about a couple of my lids breaking due to dropping the bottles and she mailed them to me free of charge!The inner seal keeps milk from leaking and the storage rack really keeps my milk organized. For about 3 weeks, I've been without lids and having to resort to other bottles and I hated it! My lids came in the mail yesterday and Mother's Milkmate bottles will again be my bottle of use."
2,Careful Sterilizing,"I got this product and boiled it as directed to sterilize. I now have 10 bottles that are partially melted, same with the caps and the little inserts. Worst part of it is that I now have melted plastic on the bottom of my good pot! I am still using the bottles to store milk, but not really happy with the product."
3,pricey,Sort of pricey for what's here. I am going to use these but I am sure that regular storage containers (sold in the same familiar dept stored we all shop at) are just as good.
2,"Doesn't leak, but can break","These are cheaper than most bottles, and with their under-lid insert (which is another piece to clean) they don't leak, but they are also the only ones we use that regularly break. Admittedly, it's when I drop the frozen bottle on the floor, but it happens (the pink lid cracks)."
3,Its okay,"I bought this system as well as two extra sets of bottles after being extremely frustrated w/ leakage from breastfeeding bags. I encountered a few problems though1) They are marketed as 5 oz bottles. While they hold 5 ozs, the markings on the bottle only go up to 4 oz, and if you put 5 ozs in them and freeze them than the bottles warp.2)If you truly have a large supply you are going to need A LOT of bottles. I typically used 10 or of these bottles a day. I still had to go and buy lots and lots more bottles.While there are things that I would improve on w/ the system, I would probably purchase it again (a little earlier though)."
4,Works great,I love this product. It works great. I would recommend purchasing 2 to have the maximum storage ability. Great to heat the bottles up in as well. Be careful not to over fill the bottles. Leave room for the milk to expand in the freezing process or the bottles will split.
5,My husband LOVES it,Before we while I was at work my husband would have to make sure he checked all the dates to not have any bottles go bad and felt it was time consuming since he's not a multi-tasker like most mothers...I got this for him AND I cause now I have a piece of mind knowing he only has to grab the first bottle (the first one in) and I would just place my new bottles on the top rack and watch them roll in stock :D like milk at the grocery store lol Btw- NEVER LEAKEDTIP***** We use a clean Dr. Brown bottle brush to gently stir the fat off the sides of the bottles since it sticks but that happens with all bottles
1,Does not work with Lansinoh pump,"It looks like a really handy product. Unfortunately the bottle threads are incompatible with the Lansinoh Affinity breast pump. I've had some ""standard"" bottles be difficult to thread, but these wouldn't even thread the slightest bit. That really reduces the convenience factor of the product. I'll be using Lansinoh's storage bottles instead. Their bottles are too long to fit in the rack, so the rack itself is also not useful for me."
2,Poor quality control: milk seeps from bottle seams,"Love the idea, and it works great... except that the bottles are very poor quality. I've had to throw half the bottles away already, due to several of them developing slow leaks from their bottom seams. Can't recommend purchasing this unless the manufacturer can source a better-quality bottle.Has anyone tried substituting with Ameda or Medela milk-storage bottles? Do they roll down the slope correctly?"
5,Surprised!,"I was surprised to find that 10 storage bottles were included in this, as it was not very clear about that in the product description. I have yet to use them for quality, but thought the other was worth mentioning."
3,Good enough,"These bottles and storage system are useful and fulfill the purpose of keeping everything straight and organized. However, 4 oz in these bottles is not the same as 4 oz. in my Dr. Brown bottles or even in my Ameda pumping bottles. I don't know if the marks on the bottles are just estimated numbers or what, but it gets frustrating when I think I have enough milk in the mother's milkmate bottle to make full eating bottle for my baby and then have to go and use some of the freshly pumped milk. FYI - they do fit perfectly on my Ameda Purely Yours pump."
4,"Great for storage, and the bottles fit Medela pumps.","This is a great idea for storing breastmilk in the freezer. We have a fairly small freezer, so storage space is at a premium. This rack is handy -- I wish we could fit two of these side by side on our freezer shelf! The first-in-first-out idea is nice, though at the rate we go through milk, it probably doesn't matter that much. It would be perfect if they had larger bottles (around 6 oz) and a slightly larger rack, but overall we are very happy, and plan to buy more of the storage bottles."
1,Do not fit on Medela pump heads,"The rack system is a great idea, but these bottles do not thread onto Medela pump system heads."
4,Worth it though a little high,"The price does seem high for this and I wish it came with a few more bottles. However, I am very glad we invested in it. Now that I am working and the hubby is taking care of the baby part time it really helps keep the milk in order. And anything that helps us not waste the ""white gold"" (as I like to think of) it is worth it. By the way, it does fit the Ameda Purely Yours pump and the Ameda bottles fit it nicely.(I bought this because I read it is better to store milk in bottles than bags - something about the nutrients sticking to the sides of the bags and being lost.)"
3,Thrifty investment,"These bottles worked well with my Medela Freestyle, though always be sure to remover the ""inner seal"" piece before attaching them to the shields, lest you will end up with milk on your lap! I ended up ditching the inner plastic pieces; the screw tops seal just fine. These bottles also work with the nipple tops that come with the Medela bottles.The rack, however, does not fit the Medela bottles, and the bottles themselves are not nearly the quality of other bottles on the market. They max out at 4.5 oz for frozen milk (vs. Medela which can hold nearly 6 oz), and the caps shatter easily if the frozen bottle is dropped (luckily, my package came with an extra cap). The inside of the mouth of the bottle is somewhat sharp, so I hated washing these.However, they are way less expensive than other bottles, and they are sold in larger quantities.Tip: Freeze the milk in the bottle upright before sticking it in the rack."
3,Does not replace current leather,I was under the impression that this item would actually replace the current leather. This item goea ontop of the current wheel. It is very nice leather and feels padded. I had to thread it a few times to get it just right. I would buy this again. If you want a perfect new steering wheel; you'll have to replace the whole thing. This is a much cheaper and easier alternative.T
2,Have I seen this before??,"If you dont have the 1st book, this is a great book!!! Without question, but all this book is, is a repeat with new pictures and littles bios of each of the Benoits. If you have the Big Bucks: The Benoit way and you are looking for new information out of this book, dont bother, you will be disappointed."
5,Favorite childrens book,This is my daughter's and my favorite children's book. Touching and beautifully written story about a little boy's loving relationships with some elderly folks who live next door.
3,Coffee Urn,"The coffe urn did exactly what I needed it to do - made a potful of good, hot coffee. The coffee stayed hot at a desirable temperature. I only wish the pot would shut off when the coffee is gone. Sooo, watch carefully."
3,leaking after 16 months,The hot-water urn started leaking after heavy use over a period of 16 months. Maybe I'm expecting too much nowadays?
3,Not Bad,"Takes a while to brew a full pot, and the power cord is really short, but it does what it's suppose to."
5,Great buy and last a long time.,I am getting ready to purchase my 2nd of these. We purchased the first one 2 years ago. It is used in the breakroom at work for all 3 shifts. It was a great buy for the money lasting 2 years of constant use.
1,Fell apart before I could add water,"The screws that hold the base to the well fell out as soon as I took it out of the box. I found some other screws around the house that worked. (I was going to return it the day I received it, but I did find the other screws.) The screws that fell out were not even the right size for the holes. What a pain in the ***!"
5,Great for Afghanistan,"Bought this and had shipped to Afghanistan after our free drip coffee maker inner rubber hoses started putting a chenical taste in all our coffee. With this, I was able to have plenty of coffee on hand for my roomate, myself, and whoever stopped by. I would make coffee in the morning (only half a pot) and it would stay warm and not ""cook off"" to be thick muddy coffee by the time we would bed down. I gifted the urn to our relief and have no doubt that it'll keep on performing well untill the last soldier receives it before forces move out of that FOB."
4,"Excellent urn, short cord","The water boils relatively quickly and stays very hot. Two cautions: 1. The outside of the urn gets hot and 2. The included cord is very short, but if you are placing it right next to the outlet that shouldn't be a problem. Or you can buy a longer cord at a hardware store. (Ours stays on our breakfast table, so the outlet is a couple of feet below it and we use an extension cord.)"
4,outside gets extremely hot,"it works great, is very lightweight. everything is fine until the outside gets so hot! i have to always make a sign for people to use caution. other than that it's a great buy."
1,Horrible,"Stopped working after the first day, no signs of trouble no smoke no funny noises, just stopped working completely. Could be a fluke, we ordered two for a conference and the second one works wonderflully, but I am still out $42 for the second one as in the haste of preparing for the conference I cannnot find the box or shipping receipte for the broken one."
4,Purchased for an office open house,"My boss enlisted me to purchase this percolator for the open house we held at our new office. It's easy to use and makes a lot of coffee for all the caffeine addicts that charged through our doors, but is gross to clean because it doesn't use filters. Also, it stains easily."
3,One Significant Shortcoming,"We purchased this coffee maker to use for a large group meeting (as one would expect with this size) and were surprised to find that the cord was about 18 inches long. The person making the coffee the first time with this urn improvised by using an extension cord normally used by the church's janitor for heavy equipment. The coffee maker works fine, but unless you're going to place it within inches of an outlet, be aware that you'll need to buy an extension cord."
5,Great coffee urn,The only complaint is that the power cord is very short (about 3ft.) and is not detachable. We make coffee every night at work and it works perfectly.
2,Keep kids away,"We're not using this for coffee, just to heat up water for tea, so I can't comment on its coffee-making properties. The exterior of the unit gets really hot, as in dangerous for kids, and the spout also has nothing to prevent a kid from operating it and scalding himself. So keep it out of reach! That also tells me that a lot of the heat is escaping and wasting electricity, there is absolutely no insulation. Construction is cheap feeling. On the good side, at least the liquid is really, really hot!"
5,Hamilton Coffee Maker,This coffee maker makes the best cup of coffee ever. The other 41 cups are very good too. It takes about 40 minutes to brew 42 cups of coffee. we even sneak out a few cups before the red light comes on.
3,Dirk Pitt Rides again...,Having read most of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels I would say that Sahara follows the form of his previous books. I will add that Cussler's writing has only improved from his early novels. In Sahara Dirk Pitt and his trust sidekick Al are once again battling forces of evil that are spawned from corporate greed and political ambition.While Cussler is no Dickens he certainly has perfected the art of story telling. I found Sahara to be be riveting as Dirk and Al extricated themselves from one impossible situation after another. Most of the adventure is set in the Sahara (as one would guess from the title) but Cussler throws in a mystery of a Civil War ironclad and what really happened to Abe Lincoln.Sahara like Cussler's other books is an easy read that will keep your attention.
5,Book vs. Movie,"The book was great. A fun read with great twist and good action. The movie on the other hand blew chunks!!! They should have stuck with the story from the book and not changed so much. If you have never read the book then I guess the movie is fine, but if you have read the book and seen the movie you know what I mean. I highly recomend the book."
5,I always enjoy reading Emerson,It came in perfect condition and on time. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
5,Brilliant,"Ralph Waldo Emerson was and is by far one of the most brilliant writers of American Literature. His writings are his collection of thoughts...both wise, and complicated. As if he is writing his deep most private thoughts into a diary meant to be read. You read his essays and lectures, and just feel as if you have just been exposed to something different in your life.However, don't just take my word for it. After all, I am only sixteen years old. But this book is brilliant."
3,Not as good as the previous books but fans won't care.,"I enjoyed it but not as much as I enjoyed the previous books. The exploration of the characters and relationships is still great but there wasn't as much flow to the drama and action, i'm starting to wonder if Terry Moore is getting a bit burnt out on the characters.Still, it is better than a lot of other stuff out there and adds a hell of a lot of respectability to the comic medium."
2,The weakest of the series.,"Sadly, I was let down by this book. While I have found the other tedious at times, I had fallen in love with the characters and followed them along. This book, however, leaves very little to be desired."
4,Strangers in Paradise pocketbook 5,"The book arrived sooner than expected, which is great, and it was quite new, the only problem being that one of the corners were a little bit bent, as if the book were under a pile of other books for some time. But, apart from that tiny detail, everything was perfect."
4,The Women of Bond,"In this documentary Maryam D'Abo sits down for one-on-one interviews with Ursula Andress, Honor Blackman, Luciana Paluzzi, Jill St. John, Lois Chile, Maude Adams, Carey Lowell, Halle Berry and Rosamund Pike. The discusions center on the changing role of the Bond girl thorugh the series. It is most definately recommended for any fan of the cinematic Bond."
5,"Great documentary, but don't buy this disc","This is a great little documentary that briefly goes over all the Bond women (up to Die Another Day), The only reason I don't recommend this disc is because the 2 disc DVD copy of Casino Royale has an updated version of this documentary, including Eva Green, on the second disc. So if you really want this just buy Casino Royale, and that way you'll get the documentary and a movie."
5,T-Rule,Looks good to me. The test will be when Dad gets it! I searched for this under slide rule so I hope this mees his expectations.
3,Too much work! (but whimsical pages),"""Learn how to use the essence of wild-grown flowers to heal the mind, body and spirit""Well, it takes dedication and effort to put together these concoctions. and that may be a therapy in itself. To heal my weary mind i'd rather read a book."
1,"Terribleproduct, misleading",WORST blades I ever bought! EVERY blade went dull within TWO shaves. Will never buy again. Let the buyer beware!!!
5,Does the job with style,"This is a beautiful wooden hairpin, polished and with a lovely grain. Moreover it gets the job done, holding up long heavy hair without sliding out or letting go.I've also bought five inch hairsticks from this artist which were equally lovely, well-designed, and effective."
1,What a complete waste,"I'm blown away by how worthless this DVD is. Imagine you're putting together about a DVD about a band. You'd probably include interviews w/ band members, live and/or recording footage, maybe some behind the scenes footage of the band.This DVD has ABSOLUTELY NONE of that. It's all interviews with random people, most of whom don't know the band. ""Parachutes is a great debut album. It shipped X number of copies."" What a complete waste of $15. I'm a huge fan of the band, so if I can't appreciate this DVD, you won't either."
4,Wonderful transaltions and modernist experiments,"These poems are not as intersting or important as his dramatic and prose works, but this volume has a few very good poems(""Echo's Bones"", ""sanies I"", ""Saint Lo"", ""Whoroscope"") and interesting trasnaltions of Apolloinaire & Rimbaud. But it is his adaptaions of the maxims of Sebastien Chamfort(called ""Long after Chamfort"") that give that characteristic mix of humor, despair, intimacy, isolation, confession and soul-searing. To wit, a few choice maxims:""Better on your arse than on your feet, Flat on your back than either, dead than the lot.Ask of all-healing, all-consoling thought Salve and solace for the woe it wrought.sleep till death healeth come ease this life disease"""
3,"Well, it WAS good...","My grandpa got me this USB drive for Christmas, and for a while it worked really well. I never had huge issues with it, though I never understood what the U3 software was supposed to do. One day, I was trying to transfer some videos onto my MacBook, and it wouldn't work (though it had worked on my MacBook for the past couple of months) while trying to find the problem, I ended up deleting everything off of my flash drive, including the U3 software. Now I can't use the drive at all between any other computers. I don't know if it's because of my MacBook or the lack of U3 software, but it's obnoxious. I looked up the U3 website and I could find nothing to help me out with my problem. I'm getting a new USB Drive, and I'm avoiding U3 at all costs."
4,"Good Drive, Annoying Software","I really like my little Memorex drive. It works great with macs (the software doesn't install, it just shows up on your desktop as a disc that you can completely ignore) and it's never lost or corrupted any of my data. I go to a college that primarily uses PCs, so it was important that my drive be compatible with both operating systems. I have found that this drive works pretty well for that. As other reviewers have noted, the U3 software is really annoying but not that big a deal. I've noticed that the drive is a little funky with Windows Vista, but it still works fine and my data has been safe and everything's okay. I would definitely recommend this drive. The software is more annoying than anything else."
4,Easy to Use,"Nice, simple piece of hardware - easy to use and easy to take for granted.Only issue in hindsight: I should have popped the extra money to get a larger size drive - at least five gig. Amazing how you run out of space quickly here..."
1,Not a U3 drive,"Careful when ordering from Amazon any of the U3 drives. Some customers have tagged items as U3 drives which are NOT. My advice is, if it doesn't say U3 in the title beware. I ordered a drive after searching specifically for U3 only to find the drive that came was only a regular U3 drive."
2,Would be nice if it actually WAS u3,"It is very compact and was the Editor's Choice in PC Magazine. This is a great deal for a plain 1GB flash drive but this drive DOES NOT have the U3 platform on it. If you are just looking for any ol' 1GB flash drive, this one is still a good choice, but I sent it back and bought one that has U3 from somewhere else."
3,Not what Amazon says it is,"When I received the product I opened it up and plugged it in and it worked nicely. I quickly realized it was U3 as was advertised by Amazon. However, it seemed to work very well and is very compact but it is just like any other USB thumb drive."
5,"Small, safe and good for files transport....",I had no problems so far! Very good! So good that I bought 3 of those and none of them are bad!
5,Very good quality,"My grandson lives in NC and is an NC State fan...his bedroom is decorated in an NC State motif...when I saw this statue, I knew it would be a welcome addition to his collection. The statue is very detailed and well worth the money...I'm sure he will love it!"
4,Made in China,"These are decent little soup ramekins. They are made for both stovetop and oven use. In addition to soup ramekins, they also make fine butter melters. While they sport the ""All Clad"" label on the handles like other other All Clad pots, they aren't made in Canonsburg, PA, but rather in China, according to the labels on the boxes. That's probably why they're so much cheaper than other All Clad cooking ware."
5,Dazzling Memoir,"This is the most engaging book I've read in several years. Written with all the power that could be expected of an Iowa Writers Program Professor, it tells it's own story while exposing the desperate truths of all who've violently wrenched themselves out of home ground to find a life that fit. Blunt, funny, ironic and wry, its bravely openhearted look at a younger self made me look clearly at my own 20-year-old self, that I've disowned for over 35 years, and invite her back in."
3,Interesting Memoir,"The writing style wasn't my favorite, but it was good writing, and an interesting story. I believe it would be especially interesting for someone who didn't grow up in North Dakota. I did, so I heard similar stories growing up from my own parents and grandparents, but I think to someone who hasn't been exposed to that way of life, it could be really interesting to learn about North Dakotans."
3,It's Okay......with one exception.,"A toaster oven is a toaster oven, right? This one is fine, except it doesn't get as hot as the temperature setting indicates, so I simply either increase the cooking temperature or the cooking time in order to compensate. It is probably off by 40-50 degrees. Otherwise, for the price, this model is fine!"
1,Horrible Toaster Oven,"First, I have never owned a toaster oven but thought I'd give it a try. Do they all ""tick"" constantly...even when you aren't using the timer? This one does and it is annoying. Second, I had a piece of bread in there to toast. After 10 minutes I gave up. The bread was hot, but certainly not toasted. Third, under no circumstances are you to get even remotely close to this oven while it is on (or for that matter, 30 minutes after) as it is about as hot on the outside as it is inside. I thought it would get warm but this was hot enough to burn someone. I would be a nervous reck letting my kids (teenagers) use this (putting something on top, or even accidently touching the side). Even the front where you turn the dials is blistering hot. If you grab the dials wrong you get burned. I had it for about 30 minutes then put it back in the box to return."
1,This machine was trouble.,"The first machine only toasted the bottom and not the top but customer service said they had their ""own"" instructions for toasting. Their way led to the edges burning. Then they said that I had to pre-heat the toaster and use the baking pan. I explained to her that toasting a bagel has traditionally been a lot easier. They sent a new model that did not work correctly either. Hamilton Beach said they would refund me up to $38 (I paid $60) but if I sent the receipt they would refer it to a manager to try and get full reimbursement.Get something else if all you want to do is toast and maybe heat something up once in a while."
1,Don't buy this item,"I've had this toaster for a year now. If it weren't a gift, sent from out of town, I would have returned it along time ago. It barely toasts at all and now most of the functions do not work at all. The heating element above is dead so it won't broil and it only toasts one side of the bread. I am hunting around for a new toaster oven before this makes it to the trash heap. I hope there is one out there."
4,Hamilton Beach Model #31506,"I'm very happy with this unit. I have it on my sailboat and I have no complaints...Other than having wished I got a digital display for no other reason then confirmed accuracy. I don't know if they make it with a digital display, I purchased this unit because it has black sides and had a convection feature. I have not noticed any cooking differences with regard to time or temperature. Everything I have cooked has ended as planned. The convection feature is very nice and in hindsight I wouldn't buy one without it. I considered the Cuisinart only because of positive experiences with their products, but they didn't offer it in black or mostly black with a convection feature, and that was my first requirement. I am very happy with this unit, and considering it takes a pounding from the weather and seas, it is holding up quite well with no problems so far."
1,After 3 months will go in trash,After 3 months of use the door hinge stuck and the glass came apart from the frame. If I could I'd give it a zero star rating.
2,Don't Buy It,"I can deal with having to set each of the three knobs each time I want to bake, broil or toast something, but the way this product works overall is not acceptable. Despite the three knobs, your choices of ""done-ness"" are either ""not done"" or burnt. As far as toasting goes, your choices are partially toasted (only on one side) or cremated. You'd have better results holding your toast over one of the burners on your stove. Same concept. I've tried moving the rack. I've tried different settings. Same thing. It does a so-so job baking. As a toaster, it's awful."
1,Once again Amazon needs a zero star option,"The price was excellent, finding it on sale for $20 at Wal-Mart, but I guess what you pay for. Actually, it wasn't even worth the twenty bucks.Toasting bread seems hit-and-miss. Using the same location each day you will find your toast is barely warm or burnt to a crisp. You will quickly look outside for the flying pigs if you happen to get a nicely browned piece of bread.Luckily, the heating element gave out today after only about 4 months of occasional use so I get to go buy a new, non-Hamilton Beach, toaster oven."
5,What I Can't Find,I have been looking high & low for this book. It was one of my favorite books as a child! I read it when I was about 9 in 1977! Now I want to find a copy not only for myself but also for my niece who is about the same age.Hope Amazon can find 2 copies for me!
4,A captivating first novel...beautifully depraved.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Mr. Elliott weaves a twisted yet hauntingly beautiful story. Despite the depravity of his characters, the reader finds his/herself envisioning them as beautiful as the narrator himself does, and loving them almost against his/her will. The narrator, Paul, reminds me of a sort of modern-day Holden Caulfield in his inability to believe he has any control over his future (or even his present). This is how Holden might be if he were strung out on junk in the 1990s.I hope Mr. Elliott publishes more. Despite minor editing glitches, and the unrealistic fast pace of this book, I enjoyed it greatly, and believe he will only improve in time."
1,dont believe this add,i was so disappointed when i received this item...i dont know where they get the info that this was originally $300.00...it looks more like $3.00. also was made in china. i am returning for a full refund.
1,FAKE Parfume,"Very disappointed about this product.It's NOT REAL Climat. FAKE product.I know this parfume smell for MANY YEARS. So, with this Toilette Spray I'm VERY disappointed."
5,Easy to Use and Works Well,This is my favorite Clock Radio I have ever had. It is easy to use and set up and complicated enough to shut off in the morning that I never accidentally turn it off while still asleep and wake up late.
1,Don't buy - fire hazard,"Bought this kettle because it looked nice & had a 3 year warranty. It failed in about 1 year. When I called about the warranty, they wanted me to return it via post at my expense for repairs. After some dispute, they finally agreed to cover the cost of shipping. They replaced the kettle with a new one. It lasted 6 months. We were told it would not be covered under warranty so my husband took it apart. The wireing in the base was the problem. It had melted the plastic base before quitting all together. We felt lucky it hadn't started a fire in our house."
1,like the design but function unreliable,"After using a different stainless steel electric kettle for several years, I pulled my TWO old CJK 17BC's out of the attic to unclutter my house. Both had problems when I put them in the attic, but both are on their best behavior during the test run.After reading the other reviews I realize that they need to go into the rubbish bin, afterall. I hate that because I love the design. It is very attractive for an electric kettle. I searched and compared many to find a design that I liked. Both CJK's had problems with the lid release - but I like the design. I think the problem is the quality of the plastic parts to the lid. One had problems with being reliable as far as maintaining contact with the base, turning it around would restart it, momentarily. It is kind of spooky that they both just worked fine, a few minutes ago, but I don't trust them.The one I'm using now is not as nice to use, and kind of ugly, but so far, has been reliable."
1,Terrible Product,The first kettle I bought would not automatically shut off. It eventually melted the base. The replacement kettle has now developed a leak around the fill indicator. I would recommend NOT purchasing this kettle. I am off to buy another brand this morning. I have been a supporter of Cuisinart for 25 years due to their quality and designs however this is probably my last purchase from them.
1,Do Not Buy from Cuisinart,"I had one of these. It died completely in 3 months. Cuisinart charged $10 shipping and handling, saying they would replaced. However, for the next 3 months, they kept telling me it was on ""back order."" It turns out that this model has been discontinued. I just called Cuisinart asking why they told me this has been discontinuied when Amazon is selling them - the answer was that Amazon must have bought a lot before they were discontinued, but they have in fact been discontinued. So don't waste your time buying this. Electric kettles are great, but this one is a very flawed product that Cuisinart won't stand behind. I feel sorry for the person whose review says they bought it in reliance on the 3-year warranty. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM CUISINART AGIN."
1,$30 per month - so not worth it,"Our old electric kettle, after about six years of daily service, stopped functioning. My wife and I did some research and settled on this one, partly because of its size, appearance, and the Cuisinart reputation. On November 12 of 2009 we ordered one through Amazon. Today, 30 January 2010, it ceased functioning. When I turn it on the little indicator light turns on for about ten or twenty seconds, then it turns off. It seems that the thermostat has malfunctioned.It's interesting how this disappointment has affected us. We're not going to try yet another electric kettle - we're going to go back to a stovetop kettle."
3,"Good when it is good, awful when it is bad","Compared to other kettles, this one has it all. The kettle outside stays cool and the steam from boiling doesn't vent up to melt the undercounter finish. Boils quickly, shuts off fine.And then it leaked a tiny bit and stopped working. Can't find one I like better but fixing this one for $35 only gives me a little more time since it will probably break down again. At $66+, I'd expect a better product. From Cuisinart, I expect the best. Disappointed on both levels. Don't waste the money."
3,lid broke after a year,"I LOVE the look of this kettle, but I did expect it to last longer than a year. While I haven't experienced problems with poor electrical contacts (like some have), the latch holding the lid closed broke recently. So now the lid will not remain closed - makes it hard to boil water! I gave the kettle 3 stars because it did last a year prior to failing. The poor design of the lid really should make it a one- or two-star product. Pity."
2,Hazard,"Being British and around electric kettles all my life this has to be one of the nicest looking but one of the worst designs. Having owned this kettle one week I have already accidentally hit the lid button whilst pouring boiling water into my cup. The on/off switch is in an ackward place, the on/off light indicator is difficult to see. This kettle is an accident waiting to happen."
1,It RUSTs,This is an expensive nice lookig product. BUT... I have had it for only six months and the bottom of the kettle rusted. I wrote to cuisinart and waiting for reply...it must be a flaw in the manufacturing of this item since it is made for heating water...right?I would not recommend at all...
1,I use it every day,"First used one in England, Good for so much more than just tea, Fast, reliable, easy to pour.."
3,"Good, but not great","I have had this kettle for just under 3 years, and I loved it. I used it almost every day to heat water for tea. That is until it just stopped working. Seemed to be some issue with the kettle not making correct contact with the base. I got it to work for a couple of extra days, by pressing down on it to make the connection, but now nothing I try will get it to turn on. Given the price of the kettle, I was hoping for at least 5 years of use. Now I'm looking for a new kettle, and I don't think I will get another one of these."
1,Warning!,"We had this kettle for quite a while, let say 6 months. We were fairly pleased with it as it did what we expected. Boiled water for tea. Anyhow, the kettle began shutting off before the water came to a boil. Then one day, as my husband plugged the kettle in, sparks flew out of the base of the kettle, where the electric cord comes out. In the garbage this Cuisinart product went."
2,Nice when it works but annoying faults,"I am on my 3rd one of these. I like the kettle a lot - when it works - but they seem to be prone to 2 faults:1: the button that opens the lid tends to stick, so you can't open the kettle to refill it. More importantly...2: the metal pin in the base unit (copper I think), which needs to be in place to make contact with the underside of the kettle for it to turn on, tends to get stuck out of place, resulting in no power. And you can't open up the base to investigate/correct the problem.Bottom line is I can't recommend this kettle - lovely looking as it is."
2,no plastic taste but stopped working,"This kettle was great because there was no or little plastice taste. However, on day when I got home the circuits had been tripped and the base was partially melted, and it no longer worked."
1,Broken after 18 months,"I bought this kettle 18 months ago. It functioned well until recently, when the mechanism for boiling became unreliable. For example, I am sitting here watching the boil light flicker on and off. The kettle starts to boil, then stops, then starts again. After 45 minutes I *might* get a cup of tea. Not worth the money. I agree with others about the lid too."
2,"Yes it boils water, but ...","In my experience this product has two significant problems:1) The design is such that it's hard not to have one's hand scalded when pouring water. Look at the picture, imagine your hand on the handle (probably pretty far up the handle - remember the thing is filled with water and thus is pretty heavy). Now imagine it rotating so that you can pour it - your hand is now direcly above the stream of steaming water. Sure, any kettle will have that problem to some extent (excepting the dispensing sort), but this one is particularly scary.2) The base is made of a fairly weak plastic. Over time, the reliability of the electrical contact scheme degrades. I finally had to get rid of mine when it started making buzzing and sparking noises."
4,watch out for the clasp!,"This is a beautiful piece of kitchen art, but it has some flaws...Our last one pooped out somewhere around 2 years (started leaking from near the handle), and the latch to close the top cracked fairly soon on the first one we bought, years ago. You can tell that we keep buying them, though! Here's why: when working properly, it is FAST, and from my research on the internet, its the best guarantee going at a three-year replacement. Suggest you hold the lever and gently push the lid down each time you fill it though - it does become second nature. We're keeping the receipt for this one, and keeping an eye on the date. Here's the thing--if it breaks after the guarantee period, we'll buy another one."
3,Cuisinart CJK-17BC electric jug kettle,"Overall, the pot is alright. Heats the water quickly and shuts off automatically. However, the lid is questionable. I have had the pot a month and thus far the lid has gotten loose and fallen into the pot twice. It's not that big a deal to replace it, just annoying. The lid pivots on two tiny plastic hinges to open for filling, then close to boil. These two hinges don't seem to quite do the job."
2,Breaks Again and Again,"I have bought three of these at Bed Bath and Beyond and they all have either developed leaks, or the top has broken. It looks great, works for a month or so, and then beware!!"
1,I'll never buy another Cuisinart product,"This WAS a great kettle, until it broke after only 10 months. The unit now constantly turns on and off and takes forever to heat the water. No wonder Amazon sells a REMANUFACTURED version of this kettle. Since I had nothing to lose, I disassembled the unit to debug the problem. To my amazement, this $70 unit employed NO electronics, just a poorly constructed mechanical relay tripped by a bi-metal sensor. The contacts were fouled and the contact arms were warped resulting in very high resistance. I managed to get it working again, but who knows how long that will last? This is only the latest in a string of Cuisinart product failures. Their engineering, quality control, and customer service, once rock solid (our food processor purchased in 1982 still works perfectly), is now terrible. I'm through with Cuisinart!"
5,Exquisite Magic,"Patti Smith once again graces us with the opportunity to get inside not her head, but her soul. Patti does not hold anything back. She shares everything she has inside her with such care that it makes you feel as if you were becoming her, with that intimate relationship the book offers you. This short tiny book offers more deep thoughts than 700 page books. Recommended to any person who can read. A must for every human."
3,Kindle version doesn't have illustrations.,"I'm a huge Patti Smith fan but her photos and drawings are part of her work. The kindle edition of this book doesn't have the illustrations mentioned in the description. Amazon refunded my payment as soon as I complained. I guess I'll wait for the paperback to come out next year.I had the same problem when I bought the ebook version of ""Just Kids"" from Borders. They too, refunded my payment when I discovered their ebook didn't have photographs."
5,Woolgathering,Woolgathering reads like a continuous poem. Don't rush to reach the end ... savour every word and you will be rewarded.
5,While out gathering....,"Out wandering I saw this slim tiny volume. (If you can wander in a Barnes and N@ble.)Which I could not afford and thought about how in her youth smith would have stolen it. Or rather...I thought about her and how she would have had Robert Motherwell steal it.I'm older now and I can order it.Slowly unfold her meanings, or write my own.It had an enigmatic quality, devoid of just about everything I do daily.Something I wanted to peek into."
5,Hawaiian Aumakua,"Lucy has had a life-long ""insightful"" career as a gifted psychic, lecturer, writer, counselor, teacher, confident, and ""ambassador to humanity"" with an ""amazing"" ability to translate for us ""insight"" into her book, The Hawaiian Aumakua."" It is a treasure among my collection of books, and I find myself consulting the ""Hawaiian Aumakua"" for guidance and thought regularly. Its a lifetime treasure. A ""must"" read!"
2,Ten Days to D-Day,"This book came highly recommended by a friend so I had great expectations. I was disappointed however. As a history buff, I had read all these stories before. It was like listening to the film ""The Longest Day"". The book did not keep my interest at all."
1,self destrying product,"I recently got this ""machine"", after unpacking the machine started a self-destruction process, it seems the plastic is weak, and joints breaked, nice idea in a terrible material."
3,one-hit wonder strikes again,"This album is so-so. I really only bought it for their one song - Two Occasions. This is the only thing worth listening. I was hoping they'll have more hits like this in their ""greatest hits"" CD but was disappointed."
2,Relaxing,I hadn't heard a few of the songs in a while so naturally it brought back memories. In all I'm glad I purchased the cd. It is a good addition to my ole skool collection.
3,The Real Deele,"Despite the fact the group produced both Babyface & L.A. Reid, The Deele are a virtually forgotten group from the 80's. They had a top ten single on the Hot 100 with ""Two Occasions"" and couple of other top ten hits on the r&b charts ""Body Talk"", ""Shoot 'Em Up Movies"". The group basically stalled once Babyface & Reid left in 1988."
3,A good reading Hebrew book that could be much better with vocabulary exercises.,"A good reading Hebrew book that could be much better with vocabulary exercises.The content of the book is really rich. However, saying from a language learner's/teacher's perspective, I would accompany the book with no less engaging system of vocabulary and speech exercises."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"Very little tech info. The title is misleading. The book covers some basic stuff like types of suspension, but lacks any real substinance. It covers mostly the installation of after market suspensions and not ""how to build rugged off-road suspensions."" Almost all of the chapters are taken directly out of the magazine. Save your money and skip this book."
2,"""Lift Kit"" book","If you are looking to upgrade your ""Big 3"" and/or a Jeep with an off the shelf lift kit, this book is for you. If you however are building a one off rig, oh let's say with Rockwell axles, Nitro shocks, a 4-link setup with 6 foot tall tractor tires, and all you wanted was basic suspension design, setup, so on and so forth, this book is NOT for you. Found nothing useful in this book that a 10 year off-road veteran didn't already knew."
2,Not all that great,"This play takes an interesting idea and then poops all over it. The characters are boring and lifeless, the philosophy is muddled, the pervasive use of asides and soliloquys is clumsy."
3,Visual Basic 6 from Scratch (Scratch Series),"Inasmuch as there are numerous errors in the book as reported by other previous reviewers (see additional reviews below), I would like for someone to give us the URL where we can find the errata sheet. I have searched the Jesse Liberty site and the web to no avail."
2,visual is not the word,"apparently the writer has no idea how to explain programming for the beginner, the book arrived fine as for the instruction on how to program is less than instructional for the absolute beginner. go and find a bookstore that caters to computer programmers and geeks and ask around before you buy a self teaching programming book for the beginner as yourself."
2,missing parts,"This is generally a very good look at how to build an application. It lacks details in the book which are on the disc though, so can be a little obscure if you get the book with no disc. You would have to fill in many parts in that case."
2,Not a beginners book,"I have just started learning Visual Basic. It has been many many years since I did some programming in Fortran and Basic so I consider myself a beginner. I got my introduction with ""Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6"" by John Similey. So I guess I'm spoiled. Visual Basic 6 from Scratch very quickly uses words and phrases that have not been defined. I know that these phrases are known by every programmer but a beginner needs help. Thus I rate this book low for use by beginners. I suspect it will be good after I have had a little more experience."
4,"Great book, but the editing leaves something to be desired.","As a beginner, this is one of the best books I have read and I highly recommend it, however I am 80% finished with the book, and have ran across many errors in the code. I would check my code against the book and find no descrepancies, and only when I looked at the code on the CD (included with the book) would I discover that it was not my error at all. This was quite frustrating. I only wish there was a site that could list all known errors within the book, before the reader goes crazy trying to find an error that they erroneously think they have made."
3,An old-fashioned novel about becoming a man,"""The Greenlander"" by Mark Adlard is a good attempt at bringing back the old-fashioned novel. It is about a whaling ship and its crew ""Greenlanders"" who embark from Northumbria, England to the Greenland Sea to find whales. Tragedy occurs, and the ship has to turn back to England. Will the crew survive the trip back? Will the hero get the girl he loves? It is a good saga of survival and brotherhood. I did like the competant Shetland woman, she was a good character."
2,Same Script,"Neither of the protagonists, Cam or Blair, evolve. Same darn patterns and same scenes played over and over again, even the language.I guess this is simply tired erotica."
5,More action and more romance,"In this installment Cam and Blair come to a place of acceptance with their feelings for one another. The fact that Cam is recalled as Blair's security chief throws their relationship for a loop, but they come out on top. Stark and Savard's relationship is heating up. Savard is injured which brings Stark's feelings about her to the forefront. It's going to be interesting to see how these couples try to figure out how to separate their professional and private lives."
5,Great Read!,"Read the first book, Above all Honor, and this is a great follow up. I have to say the first novel is the strongest but for lesbian romance, this is definitely a strong series. Especially for those who are fond of political intrigue. The only thing that seems a bit over handed are the cheesy love scenes. I mean they do the job, in terms of a steamy sex scene, but the rhetoric Radclyffe uses is sometimes campy, and at its worst, REALLY cheesy, But thats okay, what great trashy lesbian fiction wouldn't be campy!In the end, this is a great sequel and not a bad way to pass a few hours. Get it. Also try the rest of the series. You might laugh at the constant soap like drama these two ladies go through, but overall, entertaining stuff."
3,identical,"This book follows the telivision episode very closly, and if you like Star Trek Voyager, you'll see that Diane Carey has done a good job with the characterization. Otherwise, it's just like watching the episode, with no remarkable background info hidden in Tuvok's thoughts."
3,Thomas Pacconi Hand painted glass 30 piece assorted ornaments,"I was disappointed in some of the ornaments. This was my first time buying Thomas Pacconi items and I didn't care for the many animals that were in the assortment. The quality was very good, I should have looked more closely at what I was receiving."
5,mystery childhood illness,"Rebeccasreads highly recommends KILLING EARL as an interesting & sometimes humorous memoir of a terrible time in a family's life when their 12-year-old daughter suffers severe abdominal pain. It gives practical advice about navigating today's medical establishment, as well as useful Internet links & tips for patient advocates.The courage of both mother & daughter, who refused to give in to defeat, is the backbone of the book. It should bring encouragement to everyone who suffers from ""undiagnosable"" pain. Rebecca's ""mystery illness"" affects over 86,000 American children every year. Up to date information about treatment for such cases is given. If it saves even one child from enduring the year of horror & agony that Rebecca & her family lived through, KILLING EARL was well worth writing."
1,Not at all what I thought it was going to be!,"ATTENTION! This has NOTHING TO DO with John Corabi's new project (also named Zen Lunatic)!!!Besides that, it sounds to me like yet another post grunge/hard un-inspired band.Both production and interpretation are kinda weak too."
5,An amazing book,"Brent Staples is so subtle at revealing himself that you hardly notice you are thinking his thoughts until something bad happens in the book and you have to put the it down and recover from the shock. He is that good.I read this book a while ago, but I am still concerned about his little sister who was burned in a fire, I still wonder where the hairdresser ran off to, and I still see the big red tail-lights of the old American cars blasting down the highway like rockets.The only bad thing about this book is that it ended."
4,Parallel time,"""Parallel Time"" was an interesting book. It told a story about Brent's life and his struggle to be a writer. The message I got out of this book was that you are your own person and that you have total control over your life. If you want to be someone important in your life, you must never give up on your dream. Also, I was able to read and visualize how Brent grew up as black child, and how hard it was. By reading this story I have a better picture of how difficult being black in America was."
3,Paralell Lines,I think that this story has to with the troubles he had to live with. I think that the problem that he had been common for the people in the neighborhood he grew up in. It seems like a common for there to be a lot of violence in Chester and he does a good job in explaining the difficulties he had. I think that some of his explanation is exaggerated. Some of the details are very thorough. I would recommend to people who live in bad neighborhoods.
1,Not worth it,"Too sticky and gets ALL over the placeTakes TOO LONG to dryDries up in the bottle tip and clogs it, making it impossible to use the rest of the glue without cutting the tip off and making a huge mess."
1,Didn't work at all for me,I bought a small bottle to try on a difficult chair repair. I am a reasonably experienced woodworker and prepared and clamped the joint carefully. The glue joint failed almost immediately. I repeated the process and the joint failed a few days later. I then used plain old Elmers and the joint is sound months later.
3,"Holds on like a ""Cling-On"",BUT dries up in the bottle!!","I bought some of the ""white which dries clear"" Gorilla Glue and I closed it up with the cap after I was done using it.Be VERY careful cuz' this stuff is sticky and messy and foams up terrible!! It does work.....I give it that but, I came to use it on another project and the entire bottle was hard as a rock.Dang stuff dried up!!! The company needs to make a new container!!!"
4,Great stuff.,"Not much to be said, aside from this being awesome glue.Read the instructions and warning before use and you'll be fine."
1,gorilla glue,This glue is ok but dries up in 2 oz. bottle after one use. Tried to use it after two weeks and it dried up. So unless you have a lot of extra cash do not purchase until they change the packaging so you can use it more than one time.
2,Great Marketing.....Eh Product,"I fell completely for the Gimmicky moniker ""Gorilla Glue"". I needed glue to reinforce a heel on my shoe. I went to my local Walgreens and could not decide between Gorilla Glue or Super Glue. I unfortunately choose Gorilla Glue which proclaims to be for ""the toughest jobs on planet Earth"". I followed the directions, used a clamp and let the glue set overnight(instead of two hours like instructed).The glue's bond came apart after 4 hours. I guess adding additional support to a shoe heel must be one of the toughest jobs in the Unvierse."
3,Fragile leads.,Quite disappointed. The quality of the leads does not live up to the precision marking rules they are used with. Rewatching the videos makes me believe that the pencils used to demonstrate the rules must have a different compound lead. The leads in the pencils I have are fragile and difficult to use on paper much less on wood.
2,Not so good.,"A really unbelievable plot, lots of padding, just not so good as his later novels. Will not read anymore Irish stories."
4,Different but good,"Having read some of the more recent Peter Temple novels first, this was definitely a step retro, but highly enjoyable nonetheless."
4,Black Tide: Jack Irish book 2,"So this was a bit more of a stretch than Bad Debts, the conspiracy got a bit too complicated, but Temple's writing is great for late at night in the comfort of your own bed, and I'll be back for more Jack."
2,GREAT FUN!! But popped on the first day.,"We had a blast with this sled but it popped on the first day and we weren't abusing it. Just normal use with mostly kids playing on it. The sled trails were a little bumpy but I expected it to last longer than it did. It popped after we put two kids on it. Before then, it was the favorite sled of the day."
1,Disappointed,This item coming out of the box was very nice. However just one trip down an icy hill and the sled had a hole in it. It was not made for true sledding. Very disappointed. Thanks
2,Popped,We used the sled for one day last year. It worked well. Then my husband popped it the first time down the sledding hill this year. Devistated my 4 year old. Poor quality. It should have held up to minimal use. The split was unrepairable. I would not reccomend this tube.
3,Pretty but flawed,"The design and stones were very beautiful. However, one of the clips would not stay fastened and needed to be repaired before they could be worn. The recipient was very disappointed."
4,Enjoyable movie.,This movies portrays a serious subject in a fun manner. I think Molly Ringwald is delightful.
4,More real life then you think,I love this movie. It came out a couple of years after I personally had some what of the same experiences. I had a baby when I was 15 and my boyfriend and I split up for a short time then got back together and we are still together 20 years later (married at 17) so unlike what 'Rochelle O'Gorman' says (who gave the Editorial Review on this movie) teenage couples staying together is sometimes and can be a reality. I think it is a good moral story that shows it is possible to make it and stay together even when you do get together and have a baby young.
5,The Greatsest Movie Ever,I love the drama between two people that are the same age as me. I am currently going through the same bad time witm my boyfriend. I hope we are able to overcome the fights and money problems like them. It openned my eyes and I just loved this movie.
3,Disappointed,"The item arrived earlier than expected, so that was a good start. Sadly the quality of the item was a let down. It was as close to getting a pirated copy as I ever want to get. The case was flimsy, the paper insert was also flimsy stock and the disc artwork looked like it had been done on a home printer. The actual content had no flaws, but overall the presentation was less than acceptable."
4,Saw this in the theaters!,"Yes, I'm old enough to have seen this movie in the theaters, at the time a HUGE fan of Molly Ringwald. Now I'm a mom, and after having my own child and dealing with my marriage (and I was 29 when I had my son) I can honestly say that this movie is just about on the mark.What impresses me still is that post-partum depression was an issue, even though it wasn't specifically addressed. We see Ringwald's character just turn her back on her infant daughter, only to discover how awesome an experience a baby is when she has to breastfeed because no one else is around to help.Yes, it's hard to have a baby, no matter how old one is, and I can look back and honestly say that no teenager should have to go through that. It is hard, and while what we see in this movie is a slick, Hollywood portrayal, it only misses the head of the nail by a fraction. It should be shown in high school, a double feature with a childbirth video. THAT is birth control."
4,Great movie,"I love this movie. It's a romantic story about a girl that gets pregnant. Her and her high school sweetheart get married. It doesn't work out and they break up. The man is not about to give up. He goes after her and dispite what her mother says, she falls in love with him again. Any girl would wish that they had a man like him. I would recomend it to anyone."
2,boring...,"if u are looking for something romantic, don't buy!!! It's a waste of money and time as well. It's boring. This move is too serious, not instresting at all!"
2,not sticky at all,"I bought this so that I could stick a Yoda statue to the dash of my car without having any sticky residue, not only did it not stick to the dash but it didn't even stick to the Yoda statue, horrible"
1,For The Masochist In You.,"Ever desired that feeling where all of your leg hair follicles are simultaneously on fire but you didn't want to try some ""natural"" procedure, like waxing, but decided copious amounts of chemicals was truly the way you've envisioned since childhood?Then, welcome, ladies and gentlemen!Holy god...I wish I bothered researching for a few minutes online before purchasing a Canister of Agony. Everywhere burns. AGGGGHHHGGHGH."
1,This product is poop.,"Well, once you spray it, you can barely breathe it smells so bad. I sprayed it on my legs, and it was burning but I decided to take it like a man. My legs got rashy redness on them. Then, I sprayed it on my armpits, cause nobody likes the gray look you have on your pits after you shave. I decided to do it because it is supposed to dissolve the hair. I lifted my arms up, so it wouldn't rub off, and there was a terrible burning sensation on my right armpit. Then, the pain got so bad, that I washed the stuff off and looked at my armpit and there was a bleeding crack in it. I washed it off my legs too after that and the hair was halfway gone, and halfway there still. Please do not get this product. The crack looks like a fault line and I call it my earthquake. Makes good memories but I have to avoid putting deodorant on it and I smell a little stinky. Yeah, it caused me problems, so there you go."
1,AWFUL product,"This is the first online review I have ever written. I purchased this and was excited about being about to spray it on with no mess.It was awful!!! I sprayed it on in the shower. The product was not drip free. It dripped horribly and didn't stay put on my skin/hair. Also, it didn't spray evenly and was hard to reach the back side of my legs. I rinsed it off after a minute and went back to Veet.BE CAREFUL! Like the other reviewer said, it will leave your shower incredibly slippery. I had visions of falling, this stuff getting in my hair and me going bald. :( Sally Hansen needs to pull this item before it gets sued for creating a dangerous product."
1,(Spray On Shower Off ) A joke In A Can,"I am a male, wife likes my body shaved, shaving takes to long and hair grows back fast. I saw this in a store and said wow! just what I've been looking for. My wife said ""ya right thats a joke! I will use it if it works"" I used it and she's right a ""joke"". No hair came off.Drip-free spray for legs, body, arms and more is what it says on the can. After spraying it on it clump up in one area on my body waited 3 mins. showered off still had hair were the clumps were. I had no redness or bumps i'm thankful for that. After I showered it off I got my Gillette Venus Vibrance and some shaving gel and went to work.This was done only in 3 or 4 minutes. The smell was bad not the great vanilla scent it says on the can.Not worth the money or time."
1,DON'T BUY!,"Burns! Smells! My skin left swollen! Do not buy, waste of money, and just about kills your skin!! It stinks the whole house out even with the door closed!"
2,What a bummer!,"I got this product but didn't use it and kept it in a drawer for a year or two. When my electric razor broke, I decided to try it. I have weird allergies and usually react to stuff marked hypoallergenic, so I was nervous about using this brand because I can't use Sally Hansen makeup. However, I was pleased to find out that this might be the ONLY hair remover that I'm not allergic to. I'm so glad I found it because of that.However, here's the problem. The can was only enough to do my calves and my pits. Yes, I accidentally sprayed some on my bathroom wall, but still, that's not very much. What's worse is I used it on Thursday night and by Monday morning I had noticeable hair growth again. At first I thought this might just be because I left it sitting too long, but after reading all the other reviews, I now know that's not the answer.So, basically, this is a nice product because I'm not allergic to it, but there's not enough and it doesn't even last all that long. Quite a bummer."
2,Not Impressed,"I have to say that this is not a product worth spending money on. The can says ""Last days longer than shaving"" which is a lie, because the hair grew back at the same pace as regular shaving would. Stung like crazy, smelt terrible, don't try it in your basement, because the smell will stink up the whole floor even if you did it in your bathroom with a closed door. Don't waste your money on this product!! I would recommend TRIA, a laser-type hair remover. To look further into it, go to triabeauty.com."
1,Waste of time,"I thought since I was in Iraq that I should invest in a shaving cream that would be easy to remove hair. However, the complete opposite occurred. I still had to shave after I used the product. It did not wash off as easy."
1,DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT GET THIS,"I got this thinking it would be better than some of the other USB missile launchers. I was horribly wrong. It looks cool, and has laser sighting and stuff, but the firing power is atrocious. It can't even hit a target 5 feet in front of it because the missile drops off before that point. In addition, the ON/OFF switch was missing and the battery compartment had no metal to connect the batteries to, which leads me to believe that the firing power would be better if there was some way to put in batteries. If you want something similar, I suggest theNEWO 55 Dream Cheeky Wireless USB Missile Launcher, but do not under any circumstances, get this."
1,Failed on arrival...,This only work once or twice. Failed after that. Waste of money! It's too bad that something like this is available to purchase when it does not work as advertised.
4,"good but should've had ant, ardvark and gadget.",This is pretty good. Good color for the original technology. There should have been more for the money. Would have been better with about 20-30 cartoons instead of 7 or 8. They need to come out with the other characters on the Pink Panther show.
1,How Very Sad,How unfortunate that this very weak set comes out anemic pink. Why not THE COMPLETE PINK PANTHER??? With this box set you get a tease of Pink Panther but not something you would really want for your DVD collection.LETS HAVE THE COMPREHENSIVE SET PLEASEUpset in Southern MO.
4,"Almost, but no banana...","I was ready for a whipsnap back to my youth--the days of watching Bugs Bunny on a Saturday morning with a Fudgesicle for breakfast, and this DVD almost helped me return. Surely they will crank out another DVD batch after seeing how popular this disc is...after all, it IS called ""Jet Pink""! Maybe this DVD is the Pilot for a SERIES of discs, huh?4 of 5 stars because this sparse collection did NOT include my personal favorite, featuring the insatiable termite who pretty much ate all of Pink's house. THAT segment will draw me to buy the NEXT DVD if ever it comes out. Pure family entertainment--if a little pricey--that's very worth it. Highly recommended.Now I'm starting to hope for the Ant & The Aardvark!"
3,Cartoon quality varies,"Many cartoons in this DVD are nice, but others are of low quality. You definately can't tell the diference in quality between this title and the VHS titles."
4,A Great Video For All Ages!,"I originally bought this tape a few years ago because I loved the Pink Panther as a kid. After watching it a few dozen times, I put it back along with the rest of my old cartoons. I recently dug it out of my video collection for my two-year-old son and he loves it! He even has a Pink Panther figurine that he carries with him wherever he goes! I love watching this tape with him, and I hope to get him more in the near future."
2,Not so good,"I bought this for my baby, but he does not like it so much. Neither me. Video quality is nearly same as in old TV or VHS. Audio part does not have any merit. However, I expect that a few adult viewers can enjoy it, because stories are funny and enjoyable, and because it is a CLASSICAL cartoon."
2,UK/Euro has released complete 124 episodes on 4 DVDs,"This is what we get in the USA, 8 episodes of Pink Panther cartoon on ONE DVD, lol. UK and rest of Europe have already released a 4 DVD complete collection set called ""Pink Panther Cartoon Box Set"" of all 124 classic Pink Panther episodes plus unseen footages, and extras. The only shows that we get which come out super fast on DVDs are the hundreds of reality shows that just aired only 2 months ago, lol. Unfortunately this DVD set is Region 2, so you need a Region 2 DVD player or some software for your computer's DVD drive to make it region free."
3,Poor amount of cartoons,I rated this DVD 3 stars just for the fact of ONLY 7 carttons. This was absolutely ridiculous if not totally a rip-off. And what about the Ant and The Aardvark? The idiots tease you w/ their pictures on the cover and not one sniff of at least 1 toon! I hope someone comes out w/ at least 100 cartoons on DVD and I will definately purchase it. And then I can use this Jet Pink trash as a Frisbee.
3,"You need some Pepto, guys","As much as I liked the 70s TV show, including Ant & Aardvark, you guys are being too critical, and in the wrong direction.While you guys are getting all nostalgic about watching The Pink Panther Show on Saturday mornings, I'm getting nostalgic about the Pink Panther cartoons shown in theatres before, and between films during double-features in the 60s. Remember double-features?Anyway, that's what this DVD is, the cartoons from the theatres, not The Pink Panther Show, which was the Saturday morning cartoon that you all fondly remember."
2,In the top 5 theme songs of all time,They got it right with The Pink Panther Collection but the quality of the picture could be better and the price lower. Intreasting to see the experiments with the Pink Panther that didn't work. But I'd rather watch one of these at a time on the big screen before a short and film. These are great messages about the little annoyances and what we do that messes up our lives over time. And also how by staying in the moment we can have a great time despite what we have or don't have. I love it when he goes after that dino bird with the stick. Classic comedy at its finest.
2,Echoes of Innocence,"Very strange movie -- certainly not what I had expected. Was going to share with a group of ladies -- not appropriate for that. Lots of sexual overtones, not indicated on description."
3,Better than most!,"This book has good illustrations and is written in some color. It breaks-down all of the common disrhythmias and explains much of what you need to know. Also illustrates the areas of the heart that is effected with certain types of disrhythmias. One of the better books I have found at this point. I think they should print a bigger textbook size of this book, it would be even more useful."
5,Awesome little book!,"This little book is an excellent resource. Information is conveyed simply and understandably and will put you a step ahead in your Internal Medicine rotation. It lays out the basics in a concise way and fits in your pocket. I recommend it to residents, fellows and med students."
5,Keep the huge tomatoes coming!,"I love these tomatoes...I have only had mine 10 days and they have taken off! I put some in ground, and some in 1/2 barrel wine casks. They just love our weather(Central Coast, Ca) and are reaching for the sky. I followed my grandfathers rules, planted them sideways past the lower two sets of leaves and they have doubled in size! Between the rain, and 80 degree days these babies are thriving. I cant't wait to see the huge fruits these bear. A good large cage is mandatory with these guys, a salt shaker in the garden, and BBQ's for those one slice per burger delicious tomatoes. My friends begged me for these last year, and will be again this year. Their terrific flavor, and firm crisp texture make them one of the best slicers out there. Let them work for their water and you'll get thick stalks and a high yield. Congratulations to Hirts for carrying the most enjoyable heirlooms around!Mortgage Lifter Tomato 4 Plants - Lg. Well-Shaped Fruit"
2,disappointed,plants arrived looking a little pale; a couple of weeks later and they have gotten progressively worse and also have a lot of black spots on their leaves. Looks like only one (out of four) of the plants will make it. To be fair the weather has been very wet and unseasonably cool but I hoped for better results.
2,It's a pretty book,"It's a pretty book, and there were one or two interesting poems, but that's about it. Overall, it was a very disappointing purchase. It goes into the ""regifting box."""
5,A wonderful collection!,"We own several poetry books for children (Talking Like the Rain, 20th Century Children's Poetry Treasury), and while we have enjoyed reading those with our children, this one truly outshines the others. The illustrations are what make this collection superior. They are bold and colorful without being a distraction. The selection of poems is superb and hopefully in reading this book with your children, they will fall in love with language and the imagery it evokes. This is a classic!"
1,What's with all the typos??,"OK, I HATE to give this book a bad review because the selection of poetry is outsanding and the watercolor paintings are magnificent. BUT, it is a disgrace that the editor of this anthalogy let so many typos in! I read only about 20 of the poems to my son and found 3 of them had typos! A wrong word in a poem really screws up the poem. Alfred Lord Tennyson's the Eagle is now ""he clasps the crag with crooked hands, close to the sun in lonely HANDS"" (instead of lands).There were several others like that, and I shut the book. Lucky for us it was from the library. If they ever print a new edition utilizing a better editor, I would love to buy this book."
4,Interesting,"While I wouldn't agree with everything it says, this book is captivating. Victor has an interesting writing style and knows how to keep the reader glued to the pages of the book."
4,Good value and enjoyable,"I got this as a present for my 4 year-old who is in ballet lessons. She loves ballet and really wanted this. It's very much geared to a younger child, with the music and dance. It progresses from a dance studio to the ""finale"" on a real stage. This provides a nice change of pace. The production is high quality and very professional.I liked the lead dancer, she's very appealing for a young child to watch. The barre is nice for support, it's not intended to be anything more than that. The point is for the children to learn how to dance without the barre. It leads them through a variety of steps and sequences and then at the end it's all put together into a scene from Swan Lake. I think the pace is just right. It's assumed that this will be watched several times. The teaching is done through demonstration, not through detailed explanation.Our set contained two dvds and mats, one for Swan Lake and one for the Lets Go Dance introductory dvd."
3,Great Content...But Too Small For Practical Use,"This book has a lot of material; great songs and plenty of them. If you want to sit and read it, the book is fine. If you want to put it in front of you at the keyboard to play and sing, the print is too small to use. If you are going to use a fake book, buy the bigger version of this same book. If I had it to do over again I would not purchase this book."
2,"""Real Little"" Is Right!","First of all, I didn't realize the book would actually be smaller than normal. The words ""Real Little"" on the cover are quite a bit smaller than the rest of the title, as well as the print inside, so I didn't realize I would be getting anything other than the normal-sized song book. (Otherwise, the covers are exactly the same.) Furthermore, the print inside is so small that it's impossible to read the lyrics when the book is on a music stand for a gig.I didn't send it back because I felt it was my error that I didn't read the ""small print"" on the cover, but I wish I had because it's impossible to use this book for a gig. The songs are fine, but I feel ripped off because of the impossibly small print that was not disclosed adequately. Buyer beware!"
3,real little ultimate fake book,real little is right. print is very small and difficult to read. however there are a ton of songs in many styles. get a magnifying glass and you will be fine
1,Rusting out,This is a really pretty spiral spinner but in little over 3 months it has rusted out so bad that I am going to through it away. It looks horrible in my yard with all the rust just about on the entire spinner. I want be buying this product again on amazon or any place else since it won't last outside very long.
1,cant review it because it was never shipped,I received an email from amazon asking me to review this item I had purchased. This item never arrived from Macy's. I emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and I would have it in ten business days. 3 weeks later I still didnt have the item. I contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available. My account was ( reportedly ) credited but poor service on this item.
5,good,"I bought two of these. They seem to be of good quality.I think the stock must be old though, because the casing had developed a black, sticky film. It came off with isopropyl alcohol and some rubbing. Given the low price, I was fine with this. So have some cleaning substance on the ready if you buy one of these."
4,works exactly like it's supposed to,"This DVI cable works exactly like i expected it to. It has a nice thick casing, but that can cause some issues when trying to wind it up and keep it from adding to the rat nest behind one's computer. Otherwise, great product."
3,3.5 Stars for a great story that was re-told minimally...,"I just finished reading this book a few moments ago. This book is well detailed and covers all of the players involved both fairly and accurately.However, my gripe with this book is really with its style. The book seems so BLAND for a book with as interesting a subtitle as this one has. The story is told in fashion that is seemingly uninspired and didn't keep my attention for very long.Again, I reiterate, that the basic story of the coup and it's major players are covered and presented fairly, But, again, this story, to me at least, should have been a much better read..."
3,"Enjoyable read, hampered by poor editing","Although generally quite enjoyable, the book has distracting repetitions and irrelevancies. We'll often get the same, not-particularly-important quote twice. The tail number of a plane is mentioned at least 3 times, as if its identity would somehow be thrown in doubt or it would be modified but... nope. It reads as if the final editing pass was skipped in order to get the thing into print."
2,Disappointed,"I was excited to read the Wonga Coup- the plot about rich British playboys who decide to take over a small African country and steal their oil sounded fascinating, especially being a true story. However, the actual book read like journalist's notes- just a dry recounting of facts and timelines. I had expected character development and plot, and some insight into the psyches of these men involved in the plot. Instead, I felt that the story was quite dry and repetitive, and could have probably been better represented in a 10 page article."
1,annoyingly boring book,"I bought this book hoping for a nice story and some insights into a dark corner of Africa. Instead, I found a dull story that couldn't quite decide whether it is a factual account or a historical novel, with occasional lapses into facile moralizing about corruption, realpolitik, oil and poverty. It is a pity the author did not do as one reviewer recommends and condense it down to a couple pages for the Economist end-of-year issue.If you really want to read this book, please borrow a copy from a friend or a library and don't waste your money!"
5,"My mother's favorite movie, and my favorite too.","I ordered 2 copies one for my mom, and one for myself. My mother was very happy with the movie, she recieved it faster than we thought it would take and was so pleased with the wrapping, and the place where you can add your own message. Thank you for helping me make, even a late mother's day present, be so memeorable.Beverly Koever."
5,The best old black and white movie i've ever seen!,I saw this with my daughter 30 years ago on a lat nite movie and my daughter and I have talked about it all these years and wished to view it again and searched tv guides for the past 20 years until finally finding it here at AMAZON. We are grateful to AMAZON for bringing this back into our lives!
1,I found a disturbing message,"Underneath all the sentimentality of ""On Borrowed Time"", I found an implicit message that was quite disturbing. To me, Mr. Brink manipulated Pud into having a mortal injury as a way of getting Gramps to ""cross over"". Before this happened, Mr. Brink told Pud that his grandfather would be a burden to him if he continued living. These scenes were cruel and could manipulate the audience into believing that Gramps had a duty to die. It's one thing to make a movie about the inevitability of death, but to give the impression that someone should die because he or she has lived ""long enough"" is evil disguised as compassion."
4,"5 stars for story, 4 stars for film.","The QUALITY of the film is not the best, but the story and acting is. Like many others stories where death humanized, Lionel Barrymore traps him in a tree. It was made in 1939,perhaps the best year for movies. If you can handle the quality of the film, add it to your collection. Who knows they may restore the film. To say anything would spoil the film."
2,On Borrowed Time,"""On borrowed time"" will not play on any of the three dvd players I have. The cover does not indicate what areas it will not play in."
4,Gifted to cousin who was desperately trying to find this movie,He was very pleased with this and had watched it the same night as when he received it. Excellent condition all considering
5,"Excellent, not to be missed",This film was enjoyed by all the family. Very funny with a sympathetic twist to the end. A film that you will recommend to everyone you meet.
5,Author manages to do what many others can only claim!,"I enjoyed Bootstrapper's Success Secrets: 151 Tactics for Building Your Business on a Shoestring Budget, given to me by fellow Santa Barbara resident and KINKO'S founder, Paul Orfalea.Kimberly Stansell manages to do what many others can only claim: put together real and constructive steps to building a strong business and work ethic, simply. I have spent many years building a successful food business, with offices and processing facilities in the USA and Great Britain and have been involved in helping a number of smaller businesses mature, so I feel qualified to say how impressed I am with this book and the author's clear insight into providing sound business advice. -- Patrick A. Martin"
1,Too simplistic,This book maybe of help to a high school student starting out but for the rest of us it's a waste of time and money.
1,fffaaarrrrrrkkkking hell,Fffaaaarrrrkkkkk now your selling the ones already read..bloody hell some book .
1,go save some whales instead!!!!,"I had to rate this with one star, (the lowest possible choice) I would have chosen not to use any stars, but I couldn't leave the box blank. What a waste of time and money."
1,dougs opinion.. again,"I checked the meaning of the word Humorous, alas it didn't match up with the contents of this book. I didn't even to the end. Maybe I'll finish it at a later date.. much later."
1,LOL Humorous Adventures from Cyberspace by Victoria Ross,"I found this book very difficult and repetitive to read. I had to force myself to keep reading. The title was not at all applicable to the content of the book. I didn't laugh at all although I did shed some tears in the chapter ""Life Long Buddies"" The only other two stories that were worth reading were ""Growing Up In Sydney Australia, Or Have I?"" and ""The Wombat Learnings."""
1,not even worth one star.....,"Waste of time. Like somebody before me already sed, I had to put at least one star, it's not even worth filling out the form. but I got here, so I thought I may as well."
1,So Poorly Written That It's Hard to Read,"When I saw the title, I got ready to laugh. Alas, I didn't. First, the writing is strictly amateur. The syntax is so mangled and the punctuation is all over the map. The net result is that it's actually difficult to tell what is being said. But if one is going to use the word ""humorous"" in a book's title, it had better be funny. This isn't."
1,Doug finally finished the book!,"OK. I forced myself to finish this not so humorous book. It's a shame that the jokes were present, I'm sure that this particular person could have thought of something more interesting to write about than copy old jokes into a chapter for a book. The best thing was that some stories did seem to relate to real life, which was by far more interesting than two men telling us what they chat about in chat rooms, (and these are grown adults)? . Come on funnygirl! , I have a wonderful sense of laughs, but cyberbaby/cybermarriage, get a life and grow up, or maybe you've been chatting in the teen rooms and didn't know. Regards Doug."
5,Help! Wanted,"Amanda suspects that there is something very wrong about Chrissy. She wants to make her parents believe that she is evil because she claims that she killed her pets. But Amanda's parents think Chrissy is very responsible, kind and sweet."
5,One of the best!!!!!!!!,"That was the greatest book I have ever read!it has everything- mystery,fear,secret.Absolutely recommend it!"
4,I think this was a good thriller but needed less violence.,This book was a good book but it was a little shocking to me at all the violence that the author put into it. This is a good book for young adults who like violence in a book and like thrillers. I give it four stars.
5,Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,This is the best R.L. Stine book that I've ever read. And I've read about 50. I just got this book and I've already read it 3 times! I definitly recomend it!
4,Good Book,"I thought this book was good, but he has wriitten better. I was clinging on to the end of the book, but the beginning wasn't very interesting"
2,The movie The Trial did not help me in reading the book.,I had to do a college paper on it. I had to compare and contrat the book with the movie and I got more confused in the book and watching the movie. It really seems that it is one big dream for K. the main character in the book. I would never watch the movie or read the book ever again. I thought the movie was suppose to help the reader understand the book better then before. Not this movie at all. I hope someone can understand better what is going on in the book.
1,"A ""must-not"" see!","""The Trial"" was honestly one of the worst movies I have ever viewed, and I would never do it again! The entire movie was confusing, and the ending was even worse. I pity Anthony Hopkins for being in it, since he is such an awesome actor. I just wish I could ask him what the movie was about."
5,"Fast-paced, insightful look at basketball as it was-not like it is","The Bevo Francis story gives readers a chance to appreciate a exciting time in basketball history. This thoughtful and well-researched account of one man's achievements on the court is an enjoyable experience even for those of us who don't particularly enjoy watching this sport.Astounding statistics aside, the exciting descriptions of key games in Bevo's career, keep the reader riveted.Excellent choice for anyone interested in the sport of basketball and an excellent choice for those who enjoy reading about the recent past. Bevo's ""star"" continues to shine brightly!"
4,Works for me!!,"My 45 year old Dwell meter finally bit the dust and I needed a replacement in a hurry. I found this one on Amazon and ordered it. I just rebuilt the distributor on my 1967 car and got to try it out right away. The meter was easy to use and comes with instructions on how to hook it up. I was able to set the dwell angle and adjust the engine RPM easily. You can also use the meter to check the voltage on various circuits in your car. The meter appears to be well made and is just what I needed, without spending a lot of money. If you like to tinker with old cars like I do, you might find this a useful addition to your tool box."
1,No single cylinder support,Amazon forgot to mention in the product description that this is for 4/6/8 cylinder engines and will not work on single cylinder engines at all.
4,Actron CP7605,This item works good. Helps for setting points and to set idle on the vehicles that don't have a tach.
5,reliable,"This has worked great for me. I dropped it a couple of times, and it still reads great. JUST be careful to keep the sleeves over the clips, because you will get a serious shock when connection to a coil, for example."
4,Good value,"With this device, a vacuum gauge, and a timing light, you'll be able to tune most pre 1974 vehicles. I needed a replacement dwell/tach meter after a neighbor dropped my vintage Sun unit. I compared the voltmeter function with a Fluke DVM and the tach function against a known RPM source. Both functions were accurate.The unit is lightweight, accurate and reflects good value. However I wonder if the unit will prove as durable as the Sun unit."
3,ok for the price,"This product is fine for the amount it costs....simple to use...but certainly not the only editing software you could need. It has a couple neat options that I use time to time but have never totally edited a photograph using this software only. I would suggest downloading a few of the free editing programs before buying this product....for me, its simply ok...does not work with windows 7"
5,works good!,I put this sling on my model 1917 Enfield rifle and it looks great. I even have one like it on my M1 Garand and would put it on any military surplus rifle I have!
4,M1-Sling,My only problem is that there needs to be a good picture of how it is configured and attached to the rifle. It has been 50 years since I put one on.
1,gringo,"I am sure this product is of the highest quality, I love the color of the book. The speed that I recived this book was very fast, and the price was very fair. There is only one small isue with this book, It is in Spanish not Enclish, as I do not read or speek Spanish I lay awake nights wondering what I should do with it. Maybe I should move to mexico, as thee are few spanish speeking people here in Alaska where I live.How is that for a review?????? Maybe you can send me a plack writed in Greek as I don't know that language eather."
5,A Very Good Story For Teenagers And Up...,"A touching, sad, suspenseful and truth-filled story of a teenager named Rose, and her mother who helps to heal people. And an angry group of people against them. And a terrible, powerfull man who comes to their town.This is story involves risk, love, betrayal, you name it... This book has it all. I highly reccomend it.However, only for teenagers and very mature children. It is based on the horrid witch hunts and does include some disturbing things.If you have a chance to read it, do! I could hardly put it down. The suspence will catch you and hold you. A great tale.It also brings truth to what really happened in the witch hunts so long ago... A must-read.Enjoy!"
2,Mechanically Meh,"Desdemona is the oddball with a steady job in a family of theatrical people. Stark is a computer geek in the security field...who makes computers seem emotional and irrational.This was my first Krentz book, and truly I didn't fall in love - with the characters or the plot. Stark was too dry and unemotional, and Desdemona far too willing to overlook that fact. I'd sooner fall in love with a spoon. Maybe a rock. And if I had to be reminded of the Wainwright theatrical or familial ties, their ideals and idiosyncrasies one more time I was going to scream.The only saving grace is that I'm an avid fan of Ms. Krentz's historical novels under the name of Amanda Quick, so I know this one novel must have just fallen flat for me. Here's to trying again!"
4,A nice read.,"The main characters are very likeable, right from the start. A few crazy characters, as well, but they add something to the storyline. I liked the added ""family"" vibe of the story, along with the more nerdy aspects... Being a nerd myself, I like seeing some of the more math/science/technology stuff if this story. Thanks!"
5,An excellent read,"The characters in this well-written novel are delightful, fun to listen to and - basically, nice people. The heroine, Desdemona, is shown as witty, good-natured with a penchant for helping out a theatre-mad family. Sam Stark is a nerd, not the traditional towering hunk, and is all the better for it.I enjoyed the intrigue, though I did spot the crooks early in the piece.A fun, warm read."
4,A wondeful read,"Krentz is excellent at producing wonderful characters.....Sam Stark seems to be a computer genuis, the nephews eat a lot of cereal, relationships begin and end, values are important, and most important is that Desdemona has an entire family named after Shakespeare's characters. I think this book shifted romance into the computer age. A thoroughly modern spin on romance, and one worth reading."
3,Sweet one to read,"This is another one of those that I wish I could rate between a 3 and 4 star. I enjoyed the story. I appreciated Stark being a brainy (nerdy)person with a ""great bod"", wanting more out of life but not knowing how to go about it. He was great- he just needed someone to care and show him how to love and stop being so analytical about everything. The opening sign was great. Stark was left standing at the alter for the 2nd time. Desdemona is the caterier and is having to console him while she tries to get him to pay the bill. Cute scene. Desdemona was a sweetie. I did get awfully tired of her comparing everything to the Wainwright family. That got pretty ""corny"" after a while. I enjoyed reading it, though I won't want to read it again. But it was fun."
3,could've been better,"the characters were lively and real but i found too many scenes from her other book,remember when.all in all avery good read"
3,they're ok,these bones are ok. once in awhile he'll eat one. thought they might do something for his bad breath. nope.
5,Dogs loved them!,These are slightly cheaper than buying at my local stores which is a plus. Great little snacks for my 3 medium sized dogs even though they're gone in a matter of minutes. But totally expected that when ordering them.
1,mark,I was told this would ship for free and there was a shipping cost of more than it cost and they would not let me cancell it I will refuseit on my credit card for fraud.I will never buy from AMAZON AGAIN
3,Not quite what I was looking for ...,"Frankly, I was looking for some of the great coverage of John Paul II's life and papacy that aired on most of the networks during the days they covered his death and funeral. This wasn't it. It was good info. if you're looking to add to your John Paul II collection. But if you're looking for the really insirational stuff about him drawing the largest crowds on earth and his last days ... you'll have to look somewhere else. I guess I could have noticed the dvd's release date too."
4,A positive and abbreviated look at John Paul II,"I like this DVD. I bought it believing it was 75 minutes. It is actually 45 minutes of biographical information and another 30 minutes of NBC news short clips on various topics.George Weigel, papal biographer (Witness to Hope) is interviewed in this documentary. Several Childhood friends and fellow priests are also interviewed.There is so much that the late pope said and did that simply is not covered in the video.Major themes covered:His childhood and early yearsRise to the papacyPoland and CommunismThe assassination attemptThe Catholic/Jewish relationshipHis relationship with the United StatesHis ailing later yearsAll in all, you get a quick overview of a very influential historical figure.I personally think you get a better glimpse of the man in the video ""Witness to Hope"" by George Weigel."
5,Yes!,"Informative, Insightful, and Entertaining.....A great movie filled with anectodes, interviews and political commentary.....I can't believe Buddy beat up on a guy for hours and put cigarettes out on him for sleeping with his ex-wife! He did things Old Country Way!"
3,cute idea but needs to be made better,My daughter got these for xmas 2005 but after a week the antenna on one of them got kind of wrecked They still work the range isnt very far. The antenna should be all one piece not a spring. very cute but the antenna thing is a bummer.
3,Not recommended,"I wouldn't recommend this toy as it is has a lot of static, it would not switch off and would not work properly. Basically it was a waste of our money."
3,A mixed bag,"Faith Taboo was a melodic hard rock band from Sweden that featured vocalist Apollo Papathanasio, who later went on to join Firewind and Time Requiem. They were a bit heavier than the traditional AOR bands like Journey or Foreigner, but not as heavy as bands like Pink Cream 69 or Pretty Maids.Faith Taboo's 1996 debut Psychopath is, for the most part, a solid hard rock album with great melodies and better than average vocals. Unfortunately it also tends to be a bit uneven. There are times where the band sounds almost as good as Giant or Guardian, but there are also moments - like when the Papathanasio attempts to rap - where I'm left scratching my head and wondering what the hell just happened.There are probably enough good songs here to make Psychopath worthwhile to most AOR/melodic rock fans, but it's not an album to go out of your way for. If you're into melodic rock and come across a cheap used copy, by all means pick it up."
4,instant thermometer,"The instant thermometer is very useful when grilling, cooking sauces and fish. Cooking food to the correct temperature is very important and this thermometer is very useful for foods you can't leave a thermometer in while the food is cooking."
1,"Big and Beautiful, but Buyer Beware","These dishes were fine for the fist six months. After that every time you picked them up, they would chip. After a year of using these dishes, the chips were too numerous to continue using. Sent them back to Pfaltzgraff.Also, the dinner plates were over-sized and would not fit in dishwasher, microwave nor cabinets!If you buy them, they are not to be used as everyday dishes."
1,Nice style but DO NOT use in microwave,"Love the look of these dishes but the smaller plates & bowls heat up if used in the microwave for even a short period of time. How that qualifies as ""microwave safe"" is puzzling to us."
3,A nice remembrance of a great player,This book came out about a year after Roberto Clemente's death in a plane crash. The author mixes narrative and interviews with Clemente's family and friends. It's nice reading for those of us who loved watching number 21 throw strikes from the right field fence and hit line drives with his unorthodox batting style. It's good reading also for those who only know Clemente from ESPN footage.
5,Thanks for offering pre-order!,"I love that when the price went down a little after I had pre-ordered this, you matched it automaticaly. thanks"
5,Batteling Giant Alien Robots in freaking High Definition!!!!!,"And I thought just watching the show on TV would be enough, but the Blu-ray really blowed my mind!Fantastic sound, ingenious quality ... oh andBatteling and transforming giant alien robots in freaking high definition on 26 episodes + specials!!!!!I just can recommend it <3"
5,My son LOVES this series!,"Action packedoften includes a life lessona twist on the original Transformers, but still close enough that you can follow the story"
5,Great,These ceramic dish have so many uses for dipping bread to serving condiments. Even feeding you small pet a snack.
4,great stuff - strongly recommended,"NOTE - the comment about the 1978 Turnabout recording of the Piano Concerto by Gary Steigerwalt with David Epstein conducting the MIT Symphony posted by the other reviewer is complete nonsense, and should be entirely ignored - if you still do vinyl and come across a clean copy, you won't be disappointed. This recording was very much appreciated by Schuman himself, who stated it is what got him back interested in composing piano music again.--This CD set is just about essential given the state of availability of the piano concerto - and the artists here do a fine job."
4,Good all around tricycle,"We bought this tricycle for our 3 year old daughter. We had a hand-me-down from her brother that after 7 years started looking pretty ragged. We anticipate only needing this for about a year, as she'll probably ride a regular bike with training wheels next fall. We really did not want to spend [...]on a tricycle, but wanted on that was sturdy enough that she could use it safely. This one really fit all of our requirements. She LOVES her new pink tricycle and wants to ride it all the time. It is a perfect size for her (she is very small for her age, so we bought her the 10"" one and she can control it completely by herself). It has yet to tip over and our 6 year old likes to ride it as well. Overall, I'd say it is a great middle of the road tricycle!"
1,Way too small!,"This was a gift for my 3 yr old but it was SO SMALL! My daughter is average height, but her poor little legs were hitting the handles when she tried to turn the pedals! What a dissapointment as this was her big present! Our 1 yr old daughter could fit the bike perfectly, but as most parents of a one yr old would tell you - not capable of riding a tricycle yet! If your child is the average height of a 1 yr old but has the ability of a 2/3 yr old or higher - then this is the bike for you. WAY TOO SMALL."
4,good but makes it bulkier,exactly what i wanted but it does make the phone bulkier. the piece that attaches to the clip broke but that might have been my fault.
5,Easy Translator,I had an older version of Easy Translator it was not compatible when I updated from WinXP to WinXP Pro. This newer version works great.
3,HELP!,"This is perhaps the most frustrating game I've ever played. In addition to the numerous bugs others have written about, it's also highly addictive! It's a very frustrating combo...Anyway, I'm finally at the end, nearly rescued my daughter, but when I try to complete the final mission, the bad guys holding me off just keep respawning as fast as I can kill them! I found a couple cheats, but I have to type them into something called ""the console."" What is this, and how do I access this? I'm not a ""computer guy"" so to those of you who are, this must seem like a really stupid question, but please, if you have an answer for how I open ""the console"" in the game, to enter these codes, PLEASE write me back! Thanks."
1,Admirable attempt,"This game has a decent premise, let the player run free while doing jobs for different factions. True, it's been done before, but never in a location such as this, everyone adds their own little tweaks. my biggest gripe with this game is that it looks horrible! i have a fairly nice gaming rig, athlon64 3700, 1gig corsair xms memory, geforce 7600 OC, as you can see, this rig isn't a puppy, i can run F.E.A.R, doom 3,far cry, half life 2, and oblivion at mid/high to high settings with almost no slowdown, this game looks like Morrowind and still slows down. The other thing is the voice acting, in the cinematics, it's ok, but in the actualy game itself, it sounds terrible. it's a game they could have done so much with, but for one reason or another, they didn't/couldn't. well, you all know how atari's been doing lately, and perhaps games like this are the result, or the cause."
2,Not good for fans of shooters,I am a big Shooter fan and this is not the game for shooters. There are elements of a shooter but it plays more like a RPG than any shooter I have played in the past.
2,Tedious,"I played this game for 2 days (about 5 hours total) and un-installed it. All I seemed to be doing was driving back and forth on roads that I could hardly stay on. The main problem I have with the game, though, is that is is extremely buggy. Bear in mind that I don't have any problems with other games, like Battlefield Vietnam, so I know my hardware is fine. The graphics are slow and I got kicked out of the game several times. I hate companies that release software that is obviously not ready."
1,Boiling Point,"Good start, but the cut scenes and flakey action make it a pain to learn and finish. Overall frustration Factor of 10."
2,I rather play San Andreas!,I was looking forward to this game for a few months reading the previews on the game site.Why? This is not a good game.Bad graphicsBoring gameplayTo many bugs to mentionStupid storyI can go on and on but there is no comparison with San Andreas.If you want to waste your money buy that not this junk!I rather play San Andreas.AND YOU SHOULD TO!
3,Nice sets,"Each set packed securely in wooden boxes but those boxes fall apart easily so be careful. Ornaments aren't that prettily detailed but still make a nice gift for neighbors, etc. as they have their own box and story about the set. Worth the sale price, definitely."
3,Slow and Steady,"I purchased the Maverick Digital Chef's Thermometer based upon a Cook's Illustrated review. The thermometer works as advertised but takes much longer than five seconds to reach a final temperature reading (it gets close in five seconds but keep making incremental changes for some time).In subsequent instant read meat thermometer reviews, Cook's Illustrated has downgraded this thermometer for taking ""47 seconds"" to reach a final reading. Their highest ratings are now given to the Thermoworks Super-fast waterproof pocket thermometer and the CDN ProAccurate Quick Read Thermometer.I purchased the highest rated product, the Thermoworks SuperFast Thermopen (at a much higher price of $89) and have to say it is an amazing product. Quick, accurate, rock-solid readings in 1 - 2 seconds. Based on its performance, I plan to purchase several of their lower-priced Super-fast waterproof pocket thermometers to give as gifts."
2,Very Slow,"This small probe thermometer is also known as an instant read thermometer. It is one of the slowest I've ever used. It comes close to the temperature of what is being measured, then slowly rises nearly 20 degrees, finally stabilizing after nearly a minute.It is accurate (aside from no calibration feature), but extremely slow. For another 10-12 dollars there are other digital probes that give a reading in about 6-10 seconds--much more practical. Another downside to this is its inability to be calibrated. Spend a little more for speed and accuracy, or stick with the original dial type."
2,Cheaply made,"First time i used this thermometer, I had thought it had arrived broken, as I could not get it to either stay on, or register in Fahrenheit. Took a good bit of tweaking to get it to remain on and in the proper setting. It only lasted 5 uses before it died on me, but when it did work, it was accurate."
1,defective,"Doesn't work, returning it now along with the also defective Smoker dual thermometer which couldn't even broadcast the temps across 10 feet..."
3,Genius set to muzak,"These are not his own arrangements; Jobim was young and probably not yet able to orchestrate on the scale of this 3 record set ,but later on in his life he put these professional people to shame. My advice is look later in his life to find the Prime of Antonio Jobim."
1,waste,This was a waste of money . The henna ink didn't even stay on long .. & when it did it barely showed up ! Don't waste your money . Get a different henna ink
5,Neat vise,This is a great hobby/electronics vise but it will hold larger objects secure. Great range of rotation and angle on the standard base. Made in USA. The contact surfaces turn around for smaller objects.

1,Nothing But Problems,"I have had problems with the Mosquito Power Trap I purchased on 4/26/02. First, the unit would not stay on for more than five minutes. Affter that, the three green lights would start blinking, indicatine either out of gas or a leak (according to the inclosed instructions). Finally, after two calls, I was told to turn off the gas and unplug the unit, then plug it back in and turn on the gas very slowly for one complete turn. This worked for a few days. Then, I noticed the lights started blinking in succession, as if the unit was trying to change the mode. I turned the unit off and then tried to turn ib back on. The unit will not turn on. I checked to ensure it is getting power, and it is. Finally, I was able to turn the unit back on, but the fan will not run."
1,Don't Buy this product!!!!,The Flowtron MT-200 Mosquito PowerTrap I purchased did not work. Several calls to the company went unanswered. I return it to the store.
1,this thing sux,after a few months of sporadic use I get the famous three blinking lights. the fan starts and stops a few times then the blinking lights start. I mail orderedlast summer so I am SOL but registered here...just to say... that anyone reading this should avoid the flowtron mt-200 like it was a swarm of mosquitos. the performance here in seattle was poor. sirmrks KSCA
2,Chewed thru propane hose,"Within the first 2 weeks of putting it in my yard, some animal came and chewed thru the propane hose. On the Internet I found two other people that had the same problem. I would consider this a design defect. Could not find a 2 foot replacement hose to buy. Flowtron customer service is limited in terms of telephone hours and website information. Thank God Amazon sells a four foot replacement. On this replacement hose I am going to cover it with chicken fencing. One person suggested putting it inside a spring. In terms of performance, the jury is still out. It caught a few bugs but not the large number I was hoping for. The clicking noise initialy made me think something was wrong with it but the fine print says it is normal."
2,good when it works,Worked well for two years then the fan motor quit. I'm looking into getting a new motor.
1,A Piece of Junk-don't buy one,"This thing is a piece of junk, I have had 3 of them and not one has lasted for a year. The first one lasted 6-7 months before the computer went out. They replaced it but I had to pay to ship it back to Massassachutes.The second one lasted 9-10 months before the valve malfunctioned and I was going through a bottle of propane every 10-12 days. They replaced this one also (again I had to pay for shipping) but informed me that if anything went wrong with the next one I would have to pay to have it repaired. The third one lasted about a month when all the lights started flashing. I shut it down but now it will not restart. If you are thinking of purchasing a mosquito trap, don't buy a Flowtron product."
1,"bad, bad, bad","it doesn't work! dont waste your money, and for those who bought one(or 2)...I am truly sorry"
1,This product doesn't work well,"Well, at least Flowtron has responsive customer service....My two month adventure with the Flowtron unit mirrors that of many other reviewers here. The first unit failed completely, it stopped dead. But one call and it was replaced by Flowtron at no charge.The next unit worked for several weeks but I didn't catch many mosquitos, even after trying several locations in my yard. Even on days with many biting mosquitos surrounding my family, me and the machine ---- none of the bugs ended up in the trap. I caught about 5 mosquitos.I don't think the design is effective. The bugs simply aren't sucked into the machine, even if they do get close."
1,How do I get my money back?,"After 3 days of use, in two locations, not one mosquito in the trap. While installing it the first time, mosquitos ate me up. Today I moved the trap and while I was doing it, I got at least 12 bites on my legs. When I read the fine print sent with the machine, it says that tiger mosquitos are not attracted to the trap. Well, looks like my mosquitos must be tigers."
3,Worth it,"Just recieved the package in the mail quick shipping.Washed face and followed instructions.Seems like small beads at first feels like any other scrub,but after washing it off,it actually reduces pore size. from first use didn't eliminate but a good reduction is noticeable.I would recommend this product,Compared to more expensive brands Biore is still a professional brand and the quality shows,and no im not getting paid to write this im a buyer just like you,and its worth 4xs what the actual price is."
5,Nice and interactive!,"This is very fun and interactive and I'd definitely recommend it! In fact, all of the infantino puzzles provide great learning time."
4,A good read,"This book is a great read for anyone wanting to understand Temur and how he became the leader he was. The book is well written and conveys interesting perspectives on Temurs life, conquests and thinking. All in all a thoroughly good read."
3,It's a mess but interesting,"It feels like the author had a ton of information but did not know how to organize it. There were times when the footnotes seemed to be more relevant than what was above them. Also it felt like he did not know what he wanted the book to be. Chapters seemed to wander from the story line of Tamerlane to the author's travels to architecture without any direction. If he simply broke up the chapters, grouped relevant information together and incorporate the footnotes (instead of having some of them span two pages) that would have made this book a more coherent read. The editors really failed on this one.The author obviously knows an incredible amount of information on the subject and the book is very interesting none-the-less."
2,Overly dramatic,"Marozzi keeps using phrases such as gold and precious stones, and uses repetitive dramatic language to describe every battle. The book is interesting in spite of the unsophisticated writing."
2,Disappointing CD,Maybe I just didn't know what East coast cool jazz really was although I listen to lots of jazz. I found this CD basically tedious to sit and listen to. I would not recommend this CD.
5,Mesmerizing Minimalism,"All that I said for the predecessor of this album goes double for the successor. This is music absolutely unique and irreplaceable for its understated simplicity. If you're a pianist, you no doubt will be able to account for every note that Lewis plays in both hands yet be ceasely surprised at his inventiveness. Not a note is wasted. There are no fills and frills, no alternate harmonies and voicings, no melodic side trips. The pianist simply lays bare and anatomizes each of the songs, erasing the line between performance and composition.That fact that he is able to employ such virtuosic musicians this time to such purely supportive ends, using them as mere extensions of his instrument and musical genius, is all the more remarkable.Far from ""pleasant"" music, this is disciplined, minimalist art of the highest order. It may please even the casual listener but it will repay many times over the concentration of the serious one."
3,I didn't expect it to be educational,It's just a toy. And frankly my 9-year-old hasn't picked it up once since his birthday.
3,Could be better,"This is a nice design, but it is extremely flimsy. In fact, it is paper thin. I was expecting it to have a little more heft to it. Also, the pop rivets used to hold it together are overly large and detract from the appearance.Because of the lighter material, the inner unit strikes the outer in higher wind and makes rather a unattractive sound. If the copper had been thicker, it may have helped this issue.So, great design, but poor execution."
4,A GREAT Bluegrass Tribute CD,"For those of us that like to ""mix it up"" a bit, this is a great CD. After working with Jo Dee last year on the ""Burn"" tour I can't get enough of her songs and consider this a GREAT tribute album to one of the most innovative women in Country today.The album couples Jo Dee's great hits with a bluegrass spin. Seems like people can't get enough of bluegrass and I'm included.Buy this if you're ""grass is blue""-it's a great CD!!!"
3,bizarre little book,"This book is little. It's about the size of a pack of playing cards.The first section of the book is Burroughs himself, talking about his theories and experience with painting. He took up painting in his later years, declared the written word an obsolete medium (still, books were published under his name), and produced many paintings, which were shown in numerous galleries.The second half of the book concerns Burroughs and his views on guns, in part. It has the text of a conversation which was recorded during a shooting party attended by Burroughs and a few friends. It has a few witty remarks by Burroughs, but not much else.It's hard to imagine who the intended audience was for this book, unless it was Burroughs completists only.Really, _Painting And Guns_ is only for those who have read Burroughs' book of essays, _The Adding Machine_, and also all of his novels.For completists only.ken32"
4,"A great small lamp/night light for ""Nightmare"" fans","If you love Nightmare and are looking for a small lamp/night light this is perfect. The lamp measures 13"" high (of course) by 8"" wide and uses a small candelabra light bulb (included). The touch-on/off sensor is highly responsive (and works on the base, neck and even the decorative tip) and has 3 brightness levels dim, medium, full. The full level is not very bright, but this is not meant to replace any other light fixtures. The dimmest level would be GREAT as a nightlight. The lamp stand is cast to resemble a tree trunk. The glass shade art is simply and rustically painted (not glossy screened art), giving it a ""hand crafted"" look."
1,Horrible smelling product,It took me 2 days and this product smell is not out of my hair. It has a smell that is so overpowering.
4,Mag Force 7 wins!,"The Knights of Black Earth, takes you back to the Universe of the ""Star of the Guardians"" series also by Hickman. This novel focuses on Xris, the part man, part robot mercenary. Xris has formed a new mercenary group called Mag Force 7. Also found in this group are the Loti Raoul, and the engimatic Little One.Xris has found his long lost partner back in the days when he was a federal agent. Xris has a few questions for his partner regarding his last failed mission as a federal agent. However, to get to this partner will be deadly, and cause total chaos to the universe!"
1,this is too expensive!,"to all,I just had my doctor recomend Cica-Care for my post-surgery scar. He warned me that it was expensive. I told him I've always used Dr Blaine's Scar therapy but would be willing to take a look at this product.Amazing! Save your money! Use Dr Blaine's.Dr. Blaine's ScarCare Gel Pad, 1-Count Boxes"
3,Not particularly useful,"I did not find many useful ideas for my small townhome in this book. Stylistically, the designs look somewhat outdated."
1,Not for an average house,"I was really excited about this book before I opened it. I was very disappointed to see that it really only covers larger houses which already have space available. All the pictures show rooms with high to very high ceilings, entrance ways, and alot of open space. Unfortunately, I think, that the average house is much smaller, with less room to work with & lower ceilings, not every place has utility rooms, verandas or entrance ways to utilize. Even the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen. Also, many houses do not even have very much extra wall space due to small room dimensions, windows, doorways & possibly a fireplace. Try to work around that - that's what I was expecting to see, I guess, more variety in the types of homes. If you do get this book, be prepared to renovate."
2,Little enthousiasm for this book,"I agree that the book shows a wide variety of storage options available, which is what saves this book from 1 star. However, it only shows one style of interior decoration, and an outdated one at that. Most of the pictures are just so-so.Recommendation: Choose a different book.Better Source:I think Simple Solutions Storage Space by Cahill is a good book. It shows a wider variety of design styles, and they are ones that are more likely to stand the test of time. Plus, it also shows a wide variety of storage options in a wide variety of rooms."
2,not a helpful guide,this book has gorgeous pictures but not alot about creating realistic storage space. This book is more for complete remodels not creating storage space with what you have.
4,A Great Book For The History Buff,I think this is a great book. Very informative and great for cowboy lovers to read. }Highly recommended.
5,STILL LIFE POSTER by Don Crowley,"There is a Painting on The page opposite the Title Page. It is a still life poster done by Don Crowley, an Arizona Artist from Tucson. It was commisioned by The Marshals Service to commemorate thier 200th Anniversary. It was a surprise to find it when I purchased the book,He being my uncle. I purchased a copy from Amazon to give to him because I'm not even sure he's aware of its being included it this publication.Its an enjoyable and informative book about an interesting Service."
2,Susannah can't make this opera,"While there was much to like about this version, especially the action and the orchestral, the singing was not good. It is true that Susannah was excellently sung and in ensembles, her voice was the only one that was reliable and the one to be listened for. On the other hand, the other 3 singers in the main quartet (Figaro, Count, Rosina) were not accurate either in pitch or rhythm. I agree with the other review that this Susannah is terrific, but if you want a decent production that is excellent musically then choose either of the other versions with Alison Hagley as Susannah. While she may not be a better singer than this one, the other 3 principle singers are excellent."
1,snow queen,the movie was really very good but in the end very sad the director of this film is so STUPID TO KILL THE LEADING LADY who very vey good in acting
5,Good book for maze enthusiasts,This book is both unusual and perfectly suited for maze enthusiasts. There's nothing quite like it! It would make a perfect present for the right person.
4,"Great sound, good value",*The Headphones*Pros:-Excellent sound-Detachable earpieces and cable-Long cable-Closed earcups-Good value for moneyCons:-Headband flimsier than expected-Earcups can get a little tight/warm*The Watch*The watch is excellent quality and has many functions - it's well worth the extra few dollars. I use it as an everyday watch and for the gym etc. It's a great deal.*The Seller*Arrived much earlier than expected and as described.
5,Great headphones...,"Sorry I bought my headphones seperately and didnt get a watch so I can't comment on the value I am afraid. However, if it helps the headphones are really great, deep bass, crisp sounds. I bought mine for my PC and I actually prefer them to a decent set of PHILIPS speakers. The sound is more crisper (unless I am going deaf).They are also unbelievably comfy as 'ear muffin' style headphones usually are (well, compared to in the ear earphones anyway). They have a snug feel to them, and whilst they were a big tight at first, my bulldog shaped head soon stretched them into shape. If you have a 'normal' or 'average' sized head you shouldn't have any probs."
2,Pressure Washer Detergent,"Since I bought late in the season, did not have an opportunity to use. However, if anything like the Karcher detergents, save your money. Simple water pressure does as well."
1,Your Press-Away Pain,"OOOPS, what a surprise, it is a ""flip through"" book, I placed it back in the package to return, but decided even that would take more energy than I needed to give it. Sorry, I was truly dissapointed. I was taken by the title and thought it would teach numerous pressure point sights that could be used in easing the pain. Sad to say this was not the case. Very, very surprised to see it on your site.As you can tell, the words ""Press-Away"" are inportant in Fibromyalgia and similiar syndromes, and the word ""book"" refers to more than a mear few pages of near to 3X5 material. Thank you for this opportunity to review."
5,"From what I can tell, excellent filters!","I've been using these on my 2006 Dodge Magnum SXT along with Mobil 1 Oil since I got the car in 2006. I've had zero engine problems, so I guess it's doing the job well.The price on Amazon was recently a REALLY great deal so I bought a case of them and I'm stocked up for quite a while now!"
4,Great Backpacking Coffee Maker,"This little filter makes great coffee when you are backpacking. It is very durable and light weight and the fine metal mesh easily filters out all of the grounds. I have found the best way to use it is to make cowboy coffee by boiling your grounds and then use the filter when you pour the coffee in your cup. Depending on the size of your pot, you can make coffee for a few campers at the same time. Suggestion: The Finum Teeli Permanent Tea Filter is EXACTLY the same thing for half the price."
4,Great trail coffee solution,"This makes an excellent solution for making coffee on the trail. For ultralight backpackers, this simply makes sense. It weighs almost nothing (1.011oz according to my Hornady powder scale) and filters coffee very well for a metal screen filter. Granted, it doesn't filter as well as a paper filter, but on the plus side, there isn't any waste material to throw away, and you'll never have to buy another filter for it. If you don't have one of these or the Finum Brewing Basket, you need to get one! Ounces count, and no waste to carry out!"
3,Don't buy this expecting to see any music video's,"I just got this DVD and thought all Nickelback's music video's would be on it. There are none. The subtitle is actually ""An Unauthorised Documentary Film ...""Would recommend for serious Nickelback fans only."
2,"Nice idea, bad content.","It's a good DVD if you are an extremely hardcore nickelback fan, the best thing this DVD has is the interviews with the manager and other people that worked for and with the band in the early days, it has no original music or videos of the band."
3,Why mess with a good thing?,"Yes, great to have the Epic recordings on CD along with the unissued stuff from the great lost second album, however unfinished. No, the reordering and absence of songs from the first album is inexcusable. We liked it just the way it was, y'know? Strange minds out there. It's bad grammar, baby...."
3,A language student essential!,"After years of looking for a book with spanish slang with no limitations, I have found it! After picking up the basics back in Spain, I wanted to know more, and nearly drove myself crazy looking for a book on it! It has some great illustrations, has practically all the slang you could need, rude or not, and has all the spanish variations such as Cuban, Chilean, Argentinian etc. For me, I think it's brill! But then again, I'm an enthusiast, and after all this time....I've found it. Even so, it's good for a giggle, good for a reference, and for using against your non-spanish speaking mates!"
4,Idioms and more idioms,This book should be part of a student's essential reference material collection. Idioms are difficult to grasp in any language and Spanish is no exception. This resource has many of the most commonly heard idioms in day to day speech and those learning Spanish must eventually learn the meaning and use them when speaking Spanish. Understanding and learning fixed expressions authenticates one's usage of the language and brings an individual one step closer to native competency. I seriously recommend this resource for Beginners and Intermediate level students. For advance speakers I think a more challenging resource would be more beneficial to their development in the language. I recommend the McGraw-hill Diccionario del Argot: El Sohez for advance level students.
1,Hatred,"In his book, LaFlor does nothing more than immitate Hitler in his teachings of the supposed superiority of White Men. The final chapter says the solution to the Unites States' problems is to repeal the 14th ammenment and send all ""Negroes"" that wish to bare children back to Africa. I believe this book is out of print for the simple reason that it would mean the destruction of America as we know it. I was also surprised to find that it was published in 1970. The Betrayal of the White Race is foolish, one-sided, and wholly untruthful. The only good thing this book does is prove that there is still much to be done in terms of social justice."
3,ok remikes for an ok song,"This is the 5 track remix LP for Nine Inch Nails' single, ""Only"". It does not have a halo number, but it is an official release. The Tracklisting is:1.Richard X Remix-[7.24]2.EL-P Remix -[4.21]3.Richard X Dub -[7.51]4.Richard X Edit -[3.46]5.EL-P Instrumental-[4.21]Although some of the remixes have their wonderful moments, the song is not that great to begin with. If you are a serious collector, or a casual collector, i would reccomend picking it up if you are interested the price is not too bad, and you will enjoy some of it."
2,The ONLY good thing about this single...,I feel skeptical about NIN singles ever since they have stopped releasing them domestically in the USA. The singles just haven't been as good. The ONLY good thing about this single is the Live At Rehearsals version of Love Is Not Enough. It has a raw and rough feeling that I appreciate from the NOW too over-produced NIN. The DFA remix of THTF is too long - drawn out and redundant... like a bad techno song.Buy this if you collect Halos (like I do)... but if you're looking for a great single with great remixes... look for the promo 12inches instead.
1,Not as described by Amazon,I would recommend not buying this CD if you actually want the songs listed on the detail by Amazon.
3,Can't think of good title,"I really liked this movie. I'm not saying that they (the screenwriters, etc) did not stereotype a lot, and that they concentrated too much on fashion and beauty, but instead of looking at those things look at the two things it does teach: we can all learn new things, and we can work as a team.I don't like how they made fashion and beauty such a big thing, but let's face it: the world treats beautiful people nicer. It always has."
3,Maybe if you like humor,My grandchild liked this movie. Laughed a lot. I was distracted at the beginning and kinda gave up. Good to see decent family movies.
3,Corny But Fun,"The message is clear: You don't have to stop being yourself to do what you love and you don't have to give up your friends just because you have different interests. It's okay to be different. It's okay to ""not"" do everything together. And it's okay to stand up for what you believe in--in fact, survival depends on it.The movie can be a bit corny at times, but for pre-teens it's perfect! My daughter absolutely loves Bratz, the movie and hopes they will make a sequel."
3,Four highschool girls out to change the world,"3 of 5 stars for the teen comedy movie Bratz. Hollywood loves to remake a theme when it is successful, this movie is a remake of Mean Girls with more comedy and less ""social study"". Same basic themes. Take four high school girls each is skilled in a differnt subject. The school has its clicks of people (Nerds, Goths, Jocks, etc.). Our girls find it easy to fit into their clicks based on their skills (the smart girl fits with the nerds in the science club, etc). The problem is these clicks cause our BFF (Best Friend Forever) girls to drift apart. So our girls work to tear down the clicks and bring harmony. All is good until the spoiled-rich-girl decides she prefers the clicks to remain.A funny and cute movie which is pretty well made. The story is more geared towards comedy than looking at the social fabric of high school students. Yes, I recommend this movie, however, if you only have time for one movie, Mean Girls is a bit better."
2,Very disappointing,"I will not recommend anyone to spend money to buy it for their library. I was disappointed. The story moved too quickly for my liking. To have real hold of story on readers mind, the author should grasp him by establishing a strong profile of the characters whereas in this story ...... there was a woman and we don't know anything about her except that she came from seatle and withing few days she was ready to live with someone she didn't know anything about .... and get that ... she made up her mind to marry him when she looked at him first time .... Love at first sight . and then there was this indian cheif who knew that the woman he just saw was his destiny and she can replace his wife ..... ..... HmmmmGood but wasted plot of the story."
1,The worst Album put out under the Amon Duul name,"I'm a huge fan of Amon Duul II but this album is pure garbage.This is not the classic Amon Duul II line up and this album has nothing worth listening to Don't buy anything from Amon Duul II if it was released after 1975 .If you want to listen to the real Amon Duul II buy Yeti,Live in London,Tanz Der Lemmings , Vive le Trance,Carnival of Babylon or Hijack.I'd like to give this CD a Zero but I can't."
5,Great Read for Dad and Son,Just through reading this with my 12 year old son. Really enjoyed it -- it was all I could do to stop myself from reading ahead after he had hit the sack.I thought the author did a very nice job of painting both adults and kids as both heroic and flawed at the same time. The interactions between the hero and heroine are very realisticly written.
4,Boy in the Burning House Lights the Pages,"The Boy in the Burning House is what you would call a ""junior mystery"". A small murder that grabs your attention, but doesn't ""scare you silly"". This 215-page book is a great young readers novel. Good ages to read this book are from ages 11 to 14. Teenagers and adults, I don't recommend this book to you. The Boy in the Burning House really grabs your attention and keeps you asking ""What is going to happen next?"". I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery, and is in between ages 11 and 14. I give this book four-stars because it was a good well-written book. Tim Wynne-Jones is a talented author who knows how to get young people reading. I would recommend his other books, including, The Maestro, Stephen Fair, Lord of the Fries and Other Stories."
4,di28 how to use ?,i use the di28 with my palm m100 so i can send e.mail. this is a good modem and very ussfule and esey to use. it has one problem it must be use on a hard seffess. it help's me to concet my t28 to my palm m100.
3,For the beginner only.,"This book is great if you're just starting out with basic knowledge of carving. If you consider yourself almost intermediate level, move onto a more challenging book. Once I received the book I realized only a couple of projects interested me."
4,The Girl with The Gallery,"This recent book (2006) is well researched and the bibliography is extensive and impressive. It does treat Edith Halpert in a sometimes ""only female"" Gallery owner role - and there were many more than just her. Not mentioning other key female gallery owners in New York at that time is a major and curious ommission. Betty Parsons, Peggy Guggenheim, and even the later Virginia Zabriskie are important aspects of a thorough study involving how Edith might have interacted with these important figures. Still, the book was very readable and provides many interesting and historical facts to the art world of that period. Some details about who was buying art at this time is often ommited in other studies around this subject. - Michael Eggert, Novato, CA Ph.D. (Art History)"
4,Fun!,"I bought the rug for my nephew who LOVES cars. He used to set up blankets on the floor to drive his cars on, so this rug was an excellent gift for him. He is so happy to have a place to play with all his matchbox cars now. The quality of the rug is good, but I think the price was a little too high."
1,Carpet sent was not this carpet,The carpet that was sent was about half the size of this one. Another one was sent out and it was the very same carpet as the first one. I had to go to another place to buy my carpet. This is not truth is advertizing!!
3,nice but small,"we were expecting this to be a bit bigger. nice, but disappointed in the size. our 2 year doesn't have much interest in it yet, but hopefully it wasn't a complete waste of money and he will eventually play with it!"
4,Nice rug,"I'm satisfied with the rug. The colors are vibrant, and the texture is nice. It's plenty long for two kids (maybe even three). As has been mentioned, the pattern repeats (by a factor of maybe 1.5, lengthwise; and like another reviewer's, mine has a roundabout in the middle, unlike the photo). The rug appears not to be impervious to cat claws, but if it gets snagged from scratching, I'll hardly fault the rug for this.As for the size of the cars appropriate for the rug, I notice Matchbox cars work okay on the one-lane roads; two-lane roads are too tight, and parking spaces are out of the question (but most kids may not care). If you went with Micro Machines (or comparable) instead, they'd fit much better on the two-lane roads; the parking lots would still be a bit tight, but they'd fit. But then I wouldn't give Micro Machines to tiny kids."
5,Great basic microwave book,"I sent this book to my sister. It's one I had with my first microwave and gives cook times for many basic items, such as warming rolls, how long to cook particular vegetables, etc. Very helpful."
3,Not for precision cuts,"If you don't have to be exact, this cutter works great. The blade wobbles slightly so it sometimes takes a few passes to get a groove going, but I got it for cutting larger pvc pipes without having to make any loud noise."
1,Stay Away From This Album,"The first three songs are decent. Do not judge the album off of those three songs because what follows are Strokes songs destroyed in ways you never thought possible. Julian Casablancas, of The Strokes, does not like performing 12:51 at shows for some reason. A 30-second sample of this version and you'll never want to hear it again. Someday, Is This It?, Barely Legal, Under Control, and New York City Cops are just as awful. Stay away from this album!"
1,Largely a gimmick,"I recently had a laptop stolen December of 2008. I was ready for my peace of mind experience that supposedly came with the purchase of this software. The good news is they can track when the laptop is used unless the thief is smart enough to disable it. It will ping the lojack server when the laptop comes online. However, you need to keep in mind that LoJack is only going to request your local detective do something about it. You have to ask yourself, ""If the police know the phone# that is calling in are they going to act on it?"" Their thinking is, ""Even if we do we cannot make a case on who exactly is using it so why put any effort forth."" As a result, I had to really push to keep LoJack communicating with the detective and push the detective to look into it. There was very little will to follow through on either party. In addition, you have to fight to get your money-back gaurantee dollars. To this date I have received no money and no piece of mind."
1,Would not recommend,"After having a laptop stolen, here's the catch:They will only honor their money back or service guarantees IF your computer calls their center within 60 days of being reported as stolen. However, once you report it stolen, they block your access to see if the computer is actually calling in or not.If your computer does call in, then they're on the hook for a refund or replacement. If it doesn't ever call in, they don't have to pay. But, since they've blocked you from seeing the call-in logs after its reported stolen, you have to take their word for it.I have no direct knowledge that they have withheld information to avoid paying claims, but the way it is set up provides every incentive for them to do exactly that and no way for you to verify what they're telling you.Based on my experience, I'd say save your money."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"We purchased a three-year Lo-Jack contract on a Mac Laptop. It was stolen in the third year. A report was filed with the city police department immediately, submitted to Lo-Jack / Absolute Customer service, and a confirmation with all relevant details was emailed from Absolute. We spoke often with the city police detective assigned to the case, who reported that, in his experience, this service has never proven helpful in recovering a stolen laptop. We contacted the website often and the status was always ""in progress"". Because recovery seemed hopeless, we had to purchase another laptop. It has been almost one year since the theft and Absolute is doing everything possible NOT to honor their commitment. They are requiring all sorts of documentation which had already been filed at the time of the theft. As far as we are concerned, the ads are all hype and no substance."
1,"Utterly useless, and awful customer service","The company has no way to control their software, everything is set to autopilot and is embedded in the BIOS. Questions and phone calls reached people who clearly didn't know anything about the product or technology, and for someone to defeat Lojack all they have to do is turn off the wireless setting and grab whatever they want off the machine. Don't waste your money on a junk company with unskilled customer support and a weak product."
2,Expiration date,"I bought this product now(170 tabs, one per day) but the expiration date is october 2011. I won't take all until this date. It's frustating..."
4,Clear Filter to protect lens,Good quality filter. It fits perfectly to my Nikon 18-200mm VRII lens.Very expensive though as compared to other filters but the glass is pure clear.
5,one of my son's favorites & it looks like our cat,"My son, now 18 months, asks for this book every day. The cat in the story looks like ours. The story rhymes as you read it aloud. the pictures are very vivid.We have never made it to the glossary at the back which describes each species of bird since my son has no patience for that part yet, but I look forward to that when he gets older."
4,"3 year old review: ""Yucky""","I loved this book as a great intro to different kinds of birds that we actually see in our parks. But I think the story, as simple as it is, didn't capture my son."
5,Beautiful little charmer,"Another favorite of my 3 1/2 year-old daughter, along with ""Top Cat"" by the same author. Hmmm...is it possible that Top Cat or his little brother is the cat in ""Feathers for Lunch""?That aside, the pictures in this wonderful book allow a child a good first look at several North American birds, and the text introduces your child to their birdsong. All the birds are ""drawn"" (I believe they are actually designed by paper cut), to actual life-size."
4,Feathers For Lunch,"""Feathers for Lunch"""" went perfectly with a birdfeeder as a Christmas present for five year old child. I will buy this book again!"
3,I'll try to be quick,"The game is pretty much three characters slashing through hordes of enemies. Simple concept that makes for a fun game.The leveling up your weapons, arms and skills in between levels was a nice touch. Some items even change your characters appearance.Is this game worth the money?The game is fairly short so on average most people will beat this game with in 4 days."
2,Demon Stone,The game was not as fun as The Dark Allience games as it was too complicated with too many controller buttons to push to be enjoyable
3,Polish,"This game had a tone of potential. It has a decent story written by Salvatore. It has some nice graphics, and even better it allows you to play as Drizzt for a level. The voice work is nice as well. The problems I had with the game are some wonky camera angles sometimes, the fact that you can skip cut scenes(which is annoying when you get killed over and over on a boss level and have to sit through the same 2 minute cut scene for the 12th time). The game play is fairly basic with your party of 3. Warrior/thief/wizard. You can switch between the 3 and use their special abilities when needed. You level up with better weapons and spells and you hack and slash your way through the different scenarios. Fun for the most part with just enough annoying features to keep it from being a terrific game."
4,Great game,"The best thing about a video game is the story. Demon Stone has a superb one. The great story is supported with awesome graphics, stunning soundtrack and visuals, top-notch voice overs, and just plain fun. Go through several chapters slashing your way through. This game isn't epic. But it is totally worth a rent to beat."
2,Wish I spent (...) on something else,"Title says it all, I'm just glad that I held out for this to drop(...). When I poped Demoncrap I mean Demonstone in my PS2 all I could think was ""Damn I want to be Lord of the Rings"" Then I saw that the same people did both, didn't suprise me. Oh, and one more thing especially for the gameshark users, the game will freeze up if you use codes. Heed thy words, save yourself the trouble on that. Don't learn the hard way like I did."
5,Super reliable flashlight,"I bought one of these about six years ago at Wal-Mart, paying about $40. Bought it out of frustration over yet another Maglite failure at the worst possible moment. While the light is not really bright, these plastic Brinkmanns are TOUGH. I routinely demonstrate them to friends by twirling mine into the air, allowing it to bounce off the concrete. The light beam never falters. Batteries last FOREVER. Whether in a dark service tunnel, crawl space, or working on the car, I can rely on my Brinkmann. Bought this newer model for my Brother-in-law for Christmas, and a spare(finally) for myself. One thing that gives me some concern is the 3-way pushbutton off-on switch on this newer model. Seems to be a bit finicky. But what the heck. You can leave it on most of the time anyway. They're that good on batteries."
1,Not what I expected,"I was greatly disappointed by this flashlight. I did not purchase mine from this seller, but I read the product reviews here and saw it at the store. This light shines lower in intensity than an average LED flashlight and much lower than a mag light.The one I purchased was at Academy. But it has a product number of 809-1021-0 It is a darker tone of silver but all other is the same as the one listed here as 809-1020-1 Transposed numbers?"
2,"Love it, yet disappointed after failure to support product","Purchased this flashlight about 5+ years ago when LED flashlights were newer to the market. It has two modes - straight beam/wide beam and its plastic/rubber construction has held up quite well. One day I decided it would be a good idea to take off the lens housing and in the process, the center led bulb fell out striking the ground and now no longer works making the flashlight nearly worthless. I emailed Brinkmann to ask why I couldn't find a replacement bulb on their website and got a reply that they do not manufacture a replacement bulb - be forewarned!"
2,to old,"Didn't realize it was a 1998 & 99 book it was helpful, need more up to date. The questions are helpful but need all new codes for 2012"
1,Cheap!,"I bought this so that I could have the radio while I do some yardwork, etc. and still have my phone with me without another bulky item on my belt. I got this and tried to figure out what it was!! It was an odd colored (didn't match the phone at all) and cheaply made radio with an on/off, scan, and volume switch on a plastic box half the size if the phone. You have no idea what station you are listening to because there is no readout or dial, just a scan switch to get you to the next station. The reception is terrible, and the sound quality is inferior to a ... walkman. The radio easily falls off the phone when bumped and It doesn't fit onto the phone when you have the phone in a holster or carrying case so you have to put it in your pocket..."
1,piece of garb...,radio: bad reception. you dunno what station you're listening to. horrible sound. the thing is huge for no reason.hands-free: using it messed up my phone (prob. software).save your money for another phone...
3,Good product,"This was a good choice for me. The earbuds are comfortable and the radio works fairly well. I would recommend that you also buy cell phone holder to mount on your dashboard otherwise it is hard to keep the earbuds in place. If you only occasionally use your cellphone in your car and want to be safer on the road, I would recommend this as an affordable solution."
3,pretty good,"This is a pretty good device,but only if you are willing to buy an extra sd card cause it only has 32 mb which is only like 5 songs.The sound quallity is good has equilizer the recording quallity is mid range good ALSO you can record from an xbox and other av devices but you will need a small adapter (1 dollar) to connect two male ports togeather. If youre on a budget and are looking for a decent video dvr mp3 player BUY"
1,"Norpro Eclipse Teapot from Everett, WA",We purchased this nice 20oz teapot for the two of us. The problem is with the rim that holds the lid and the SS mesh filter. The rim is plastic and distorts & warps from using hot water so the ss filter can not be removed or installed. I called them at 425-261-1000 to ask for a replacement rim which they sent me for FREE. The new one only lasted 2 pot fulls before the rim became too warped to use and the filter was stuck. They need a stainless steel rim rather than a plastic one.Are we suppose to be thinking green? We should not purchase something that we use and then throw away. Our products should be repairable and renewable.
4,Interesting horror with style.,"Often mistakenly listed as just a qraphic horror, it's actually a strange dark European thriller. Plot: An overstressed woman finds out she's pregnant. Overwhelmed, she flees her dominating man and job at a small time travelling circus. Once away she soon realizes somethind odd is growing inside her. 70% horror, 20% drama, 10% dark comedy. A good film."
3,good stand up show if you know Kevin Smith,this is a good stand up show for people who have seen kevin smith's movies. other look somewhere else. thanks.
5,totally excellent,kevin smith is the ultimate of filmmaking this especially it was so great it's worth the time mr. Smith i sallute you
5,Laughs,"I loved this! I don't have much of a sense of humor and this made me roll with laughter, I had tears I laughed so much. If you love Kevin Smith movies and want further insight into them, this is something you should watch."
5,"Brilliant good fun, a side to Smith before unseen!","Smith shows off his intellect and comedic sides in this set, certainly a night well spent. I watched the dvds one at a time, waiting between the two. After the first one I didnt think it could get any better, but disc two doesnt dissapoint! An excellent set, hilarious from start to finish, well worth the money!"
4,Great DVD,"Very funny, very interesting and very honest. This will be enjoyed by any Kevin Smith or Jason Mewes fan. It's very long, you definately get your money's worth. I think many of the questions asked by the students are one's that many of us (his fans) have, so we find many of our questions answered, which is great. This DVD shows just how ""real"" Kevin Smith really is. I loved it!"
2,rent it,"There are a couple of hilarious stories here (particularly Smith's failed documentary with Prince and his run-ins with Jon Peters), but I wouldn't advise about actually buying this DVD. Unless you're a big Smith fan, you can only laugh at so many d--- jokes."
4,Who is John Q. Public?,"I read a lot of reviews on Amazon.com, as I am always curious about what other people think. Invariably, the reviewer ""John Q. Public"" comes up with his two cents. Does this man like anything? His comments are routinely negative and rarely on point. For this item, he is discussing Kevin Smith's script for Superman. I'm not trying to buy that here. On the review for Sin City, the movie, he dismisses it because Frank Miller is a ""drunk"". What does that matter?I'm glad we live in America with the freedom of speech, even though it does mean we have to wade through pointless dreck from someone who clearly did not get enough attention...ever."
4,Step by Step to Selling Your Screenplay,"Whether you live in Iowa or Los Angeles, this book will guide you--in easy to understand language--from the finish line of your laptop to the Oscar stage. Its commonsense is commendable--""if you're not working is it your agent's fault?""--and its realism worth the price of admission: ""What they are looking for in addition to good writing."" Includes agent/manager profiles and discussion of agents/managers/attorneys--""which do you need?"""
1,strong,the story was strong. the hero did not love the heroine and he did not respect her or trust her. he thought she was not good enough. every other people had to force him to go after the heroine. actions spek louder than word. his actions says he did not love her. the heroine was the worst kind of doomat.
2,Yawn,In no way is this a 5 star book! The story got really old & boring really fast & the characters were not very likeable.
2,Basic and non updated - boring,"This book was written 1n 1993.... even though the basics remain the same, there are other books on the subjet like the ones written by Myra Savant-Harris that are 100% more updated."
4,Easy Game for 5 & 6 yr olds,This game was the kids favorite of 6 Playstation games we tried (All rated E). Most were too difficult for our 5 & 6 yr olds.
4,A decent game,"This wasn't my absolute favorite game for Gameboy Color, but it wasn't the worst. This game is fun and challenging. You really need to pay attention to the controller direcctions though. The buttons you press for this game are totally different from most racing games."
3,"Okay game, but references to WDW are minimal","Except for the names of each track, there is almost no real reference to Walt Disney World in this game. That's disappointing. But, as a kids' games go, it's pretty good and not too hard for the younger set to pick up."
2,fun but dumb in a way,not my idea of a great racing game if i was the one who created this game it would make this game alot more better than this
4,hard to say no...,"Mary Anne takes on a baby-sitting job that actually turns out to be more. Not only does she have to deal with little kids, she is also asked to do chores around the house that go beyond the norm that a babysitter would do. It is hard for her to say no because she is so nice, and she thinks that one extra chore can't hurt, but then it just piles on..."
4,A perfect book for boring times in the day!,It was very good the way how Mary-Anne tries to help out but ends up doing EVERTHING! I like the way she gets tired of it and tries to relate it to Mrs Towne. (Mrs Towne is the lady that Mary-Anne helps out)
1,Not an Amazon seller anymore. Amazon returned my money as promised.,"Just in case they return, I would suggest not using webbookstore for any purchases. Not reliable at all!!"
4,Is the Mathematics or Circuit Analysis,I found this book a little heavy on derivation via pure mathematics. Other textbooks I own on the same subject derive their equations with a bit more practical application in mind. I did find the Matlab work easy to follow and made the book worth the purchase. I would not recommend this book as the sole textbook for a Circuit Analysis II course but would recommend it paired with a standard book on circuit analysis.
4,Paraffin Wax,Due to the cold weather my hands get very dry. This paraffin wax had a light oil in it which made my hands smoother.
3,Not always WYSIWIG (What you see is what you get),"This came in 6 1lb pags of parafin beads. Tiny beads. Not the blocks that it looks like. It would have been nice if they were in the block form so that I can use them easier. I use these to clean up my palette and brushes when I am working with encaustics... I don't feel like going through the trouble of returning them, so I will keep it ....... I guess..... and just figure out how to work around the fact that it's not in solid blocks.Some warning would have been nice."
5,love it!,"Love the feel of this paraffin! Heats up quickly, leave it on for at least 10 minutes andit comes off better."
1,Not worth ordering again,"I have been waiting patiently for the paraffin wax but none has been delivered as yet.The order was placed on October 26, 2009. I tracked the order and it only shows there was an Attempt to deliver this package on November 2, 2009.It is now Friday, November 27, 2009, and no product.I haven't checked yet to see if my credit card was charged, but I bet it was.Paraffin Wax Refills - Unscented - 6 lb pkgUNHappy Customer"
2,Shipping weight (?),"When I ordered 6 lbs. of Paraffin wax I expected to be charged for that weight. However, the shipping charges - @ $.95 per lb. - came to $15.00 (more than the price of the product itself). Later, when reviewing the order I saw that if fact, this was the price they stated on the order preview. However, unlike the purchase price which was printed in bold type, the shipping price was not. And so of course, I missed it. A classic case of 'let the buyer beware'. And by the way - why does it take 4 lbs. of packaging to ship 6 lbs. of anything?"
3,"Good item, but shipping cost is more expencive then the product!",I ordered this item and was kind of happy at first.Product is worth its price. Then I decided to reorder it ones again and checked the shipping cost.It was 2 dollars more then the price of the product! Would have to look for something else.
1,Product Description is Inaccurate,"I order these ""unscented Paraffin wax refills,"" but the product I received differs from the product description (I haven't actually used the product). The product I received was ""antibacterial"" paraffin, which has Triclosan listed as the active ingredient. Had I know this was ""antibacterial"" paraffin I would not have placed the order. I am not comfortable using anything that contains Triclosan, which has been linked to antibacterial resistance, and in a recent study was shown to restrict muscle performance in mice and fish."
4,Works ok but wanted the brick not pellets.,"I was expecting to get the bricks, that's what is pictured, but got pellets. The texture is a little different for the pellets...not bad just different. If I can't find the brick style would order this again."
2,Parafin wax,Do not like it as well as the HoMedic because it leaves an oily feel when done and does not peel away from hands as well after use.
4,Would be five star if it was priced differently,"This is one of those items that was priced in a way to either trying to recoup the shipping cost for the seller, or making you to order another item less useful to qualify for free shipping. The wax bars were fine, and there was not much to rate on, good or bad. I took away one star because it put me, the buyer in a awkward position. Since the wax bars were heavy, the seller would like to charge a good sum for the shipping if I order this by itself. So, I ended up finding something ""not so needed"" to order at the same time, and I felt it was a marketing ploy."
4,price good on wax refills,"good price on wax, but did not come with bags to wrap your hands/feet. the wax was in little round pellets so it was easier and quicker to melt. wouldve been a 5 rating if they included the bags."
2,it has alcohol in it,"I used this product while having braids, so I needed something to keep my scalp cleansed. I did notice build up and that my scalp felt ""heated"" while applying. Then I read the ingredient list which contains alcohol, which can dry the skin. It smelled okay but it has a little alcohol smell. I haven't purchased this item again and I won't change my mind. It was okay but not great to me."
4,very good product,after i got my braids done it started itching and i had dandruff. using this product is very convinent because i dont have to get my hair wet and it helped with my itching. will definately recommend this product
1,Not the original one!,Note that this is not the original Konica Minolta PagePro 1400W Toner Cartridge. I prefer to spend a few bucks more to get the original one to be assure that it works with my printer. The good thing is that I am able to return the product and get my money back.
4,lasts long,This toner is so worth having. It lasts quite a long time and I feel I use my printer alot but this lasts me about a year and a half. It is easy to install and the price is excellent for the quality of this item.
4,dreaming as a spiritual path,Robert doesn't as much offer new techniques for Lucid Dreaming (what he calls conscious dreaming) as he delves the reader into the dream world. He persues dreaming as more of a spiritual path than just a matter of a tool for self improvement.
5,Mortar and pestle,The product is exactly what I expected and works wonderfully for what I needed.Thank you for the exellent quality!!Love it
5,Good Deal!,"So far, I've had no problems with this crucible. Nothing has stained it or been hard to remove from it."
3,Good but...,"It is of good quality, but really small. I may have bigger hands, but you need to hold the hold the pestle with the tip of your fingers which renders it hard to pound harder aliments."
5,Works Like a Charm,"Accomplishes exactly what i wanted it for, very nice looking, easy to use, good size and it looks nice too."
4,"Does the job, price is right!","I bought the mortar and pestle to grind flax seeds. I found the product was great for doing small jobs, it gives my biceps a short workout, and it looks attractive sitting on my kitchen counter. All that for less than $10!"
1,Look for something different,"I bought this item to grind powder type substances but the interior is totally unfinished and you can't completely remove the previous substance from this product. For the price look at other mortar and pestle sets. I wish I had never bought this piece of junk. It's way too expensive and a very cheap product. Keep on looking, buy a different product!!!!"
4,Very strong magnets,"These magnets are very strong, and fun to play with. Magnets are even stronger when placed on a refridgerator. Strong enough to hold a note on the fridge and know that you will never lose that important message. You can also use these magnets to store some hand tools on the wall of a metal workbench."
5,Excellent Book for Mothers and Researchers,"While this book is written from a research perspective, I have used it as a gift to potential and now-pregnant wives. I think it is a must-read for them. How else can they possibly know how important the pre-natal months are to the emotional well-being of their child-to-be? How else will they know how much that pre-birth infant picks up and is affected by its mother's environment and attitudes. I've also used it as reference material for my lectures and writing about early childhood memory."
5,Very informative,"""Secrets"" gives many unbelievable and informative studies with much insite to problems that effect our actions and responses to circumstances today. I wish there were something updated, since this was published in the early eighties."
1,"Not what I was expecting while ""expecting""","As a new mother-to-be, my goal was to learn how to bond with my unborn child in a healthy manner so as to get a jumpstart on parenthood. The Secret Life of the Unborn Child speaks direclty to the psychological and biological challenges that affect the unborn child. There are several studies which describe the effects of trauma, stress and neglect on the mother and child, both during the pregnancy and the delivery. The results of these traumas have shown to cause deep seeded psychological and emotional problems for your child, carrying on into adulthood. It's not the ""feel-good"" bonding information I was so looking forward to reading."
3,"Great insight for its time, a little dated/elementary for those familiar","Dr. Verney was certainly a pioneer and remains a leader in the field of pre and perinatal psychology. This book is a good primer, filled with citations and references. If, like me, you are someone familiar with the ideas presented, this book may seem elementary. I would have preferred to purchase one of his more recent titles with updates to his theories. This book is a little bit of singing to the choir, not a wholly dispassionate scientific study but that doesn't detract from its central message that the pre and perinatal environment matters."
5,Insight into Life before Birth.,"I read this book because I wanted a glimpse into what I might have experienced in the womb before I was born into this world. I had so many questions and wondered if some of the things I faced in life were a result of the things that affected my growth during my mother's pregnancy. The insights I received were very eye-opening and did indeed contribute to my having a better view of myself, my childhood challenges and the way I looked at people around me. I got to see how outside influences touched me so deeply, even before I was born. A well written book."
5,Great book,My daughter is pregnant and I remembered reading this book when I was pregnant with her so I sent her a copy. She LOVES it and is recommending it to her other pregnant friends.
5,The unborn child is a real person with thoughts and feelings,"This was the first book I ever read about the thoughts, feelings, and capabilities of the unborn child. As a childbirth educator, I found the information very valuable in educating my clients about the needs of their unborn babies. It gives us a very clear, vivid picture that those are not just ""blobs of tissue"" developing in our wombs - they are living, thinking, reacting human beings who have feelings. Hopefully this information will help pregnant women think more carefully about how they take care of themselves during pregnancy and how they can bond with their babies before birth."
5,Superb!,"As an OB/GYN, this book is required reading for all of my pregnant patients as well as for those thinking of starting a family. Any physician who is up to date with current peer-reviewed literature in the realm of prenatal psychology would know the value of Dr. Verny's book and his work. ..."
1,Hello? Widescreen Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great movie, but it needs WIDESCREEN. This mediorce dvd is in FULLSCREEN:(I would definitely buy if it was in widescreen"
3,A Personal Favorite,"I like the main leads (Ringwald, McCarthy) and I love teen angst. This movie delivers this in spades.For any guy who has really liked a girl, but for whatever reason knows he can't be with her because she doesn't fit in his world, this is the kind of angst in this movie.It is basically a chic flick, but I like those if they are good. And IMO...this one is good.It is not the greatest movie ever made, but I like the flavor of it well enough that I bought it. Very re-watchable."
1,What the ...,"This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen. I saw it with my brother who loves Molly, and even he hated it. The movie doesn't make sense, the dialog is stilted and awkward, and it's pretty dull. The story seems like it would have been interesting, but it falls flat. It almost seems as if the director quit the production in the middle, and so they just stopped filming and spliced together what they had. If you absolutely must see it, rent it. I beg you, save your money! Life is short - don't waste it on this movie."
3,cute..but....,This movie was cute..but a little boring at times..if you like the brat pack ALOT you might enjoy this. But Andrew McCarthy and Rolly Ringwald make a cute couple. especially in Pretty In Pink THAT'S a movie with them that everyone would enjoy.
2,Queen City special!,"I admit this movie was boring and the acting was mediocre at best. The story was also lame. But being a close resident to Cincinnati, I enjoyed all the places shot on location that Iv'e been to i.e. the serpentine wall,U.C. 2 stars for familiarity only because I live close to Cincy."
1,The worst movie I have ever been to a Cinema to watch,"Awful. Bad acting, bad story. You couldn't pay me enough to watch this movie again. As bad as Mickey Blue Eyes."
3,An unabashedly favorable review!,"I have been a fan of this movie for many years since its release. When I decided to purchase, I was surprised to see such negative reviews. Granted its not necessarily Oscar quality material. But, the cinematic backdrop is interesting and goes a long way to lend great atmosphere to the story. I think McCarthy and Ringwald do a good job with the acting. It's not hard to understand why Larkin (McCarthy) falls for Jewel (Ringwald ) right off the bat, Ringwald imbues her character with a palpable steamy sensuality in their first meeting. Mortensen (Green) is convincing as the low life ""husband"" of Jewel. It's also interesting to see an early role for Ben Stiller, especially if you are a fan. I can't agree that ... is wasted on this movie. In fact, I wish it were available in DVD format. The story ending has a heart-rending quality that has stayed with me through the years since I first viewed this movie."
5,A Very Good (But Sad) Movie,"All of these bad reviews confuse a movie they didn't like with a badly made movie. This is a very well made movie, with perfectly competent performances. The tone is quite serious, and the ending won't cheer anyone up. But then there are many people who loved Titanic, which I found utterly depressing. More to the point, though, who cares about the problems of these rich kids? Not me. The REAL reason to watch this is to see Molly Ringwald at her most beautiful. And if you enjoy this film, check out Less Than Zero, another gloomy but solid (& underrated) '80s film. The WORST '80s film is Bright Lights, Big City - don't say I didn't warn you!"
3,LOVE THE SOUNDTRACK TO THIS MOVIE....BUT...,"I NEED HELP. THIS MOVIE WAS JUST AVERAGE, OK MAYBE BELOW, HOWEVER.. I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE MUSIC FROM THIS MOVIE.. COME TO FIND OUT THERE WAS NEVER A SOUNDTRACK MADE. SO IN ORDER FOR ME TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC I ENJOY I HAVE TO WATCH THE DARN MOVIE OVER AND OVER.. WHEN THE MOVIE ENDS AS THE CREDIT ROLLS THERE IS A SONG NAME ""NO TOMORROW"" ITS MY ALL TIME MOST FAVORITE. SOME GUY NAMED GEORGE HAWKINS SINGS IT.. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW I CAN FIND THIS GUY'S MUSIC? IVE LOOKED HIGH AND LOW, ITS REAL DISAPPOINTING THAT THERE WAS NEVER A SOUNDTRACK, ESPECIALLY SINCE DAVID FOSTER COMPOSED THE MUSIC FOR THIS MOVIE."
3,ANDREW MACCARTHY AND MOLLY RINGWALD TOGETHER,The coupling of these two actors has been a favorite of mine since PRETTY IN PINK. I wasn't crazy about the ending but I still love these two together.
5,Unique Film!!!,"Huge Molly Ringwald fan!!! I saw this movie at my boyfriend's mom's house, she had it on vhs!!! It reminded me of how much I liked the movie, and how strange and unique it was!!! So I went home that night and ordered it on dvd!!! Very happy that I now own it!!!"
3,Comfort good -- questionable quality,"I got these because I could no longer get pleated pants/jeans at my local retail stores. They are very comfortable, although I would like to see more color options for the larger sizes instead of just stonewash (denim). My only problem is that the stitching of the placket over the zipper is VERY, VERY weak. Once you wash the jeans it breaks out, unravels and your stuck wearing a pair pants with your zipper showing."
3,No Butt Pockets!,"I wish there would've been a picture of the back of these jeans. There are no butt pockets in them, which make them seem extremely old-fashioned! Otherwise the quality is nice and they fit well."
4,Glasgows Greatest,"Another work of genius from the greatest band you've never heard of.Slow,moody songs of longing and obsession set mostly on the rain-soaked streets of Glasgow,Scotland.If you've got any romance in your soul and a love of beauty then you really should check this band out.A beautiful poison indeed.Go on,take a chance,you may just fall in love."
2,Just get some Bryan Ferry,"I had a copy of the track ""Dreamless"" and thought it was superb. I couldn't find the album anywhere to listen to, so I took a chance and ordered it. I regret this decision. This album is melodramatic. The vocalist's style is over-calculated. It sounds like he is an actor trying to play a part. What should be subtle and smooth just ends up sounding schmaltzy. I think that this vocalist must be a big fan of Bryan Ferry. This is certainly not a bad thing, but Bryan is a natural. This guy is an imitator. This is too bad because his vocal quality is actually quite unique in a good way. The arrangements are sloppy. The mix is amateurish. (Too much reverb on the vocal.) I was very excited about this album. I still think that ""Dreamless"" is a very good song, but not strong enough to carry the whole album. What a disappointment."
2,"Cleans well, but container leaks","I ordered this to clean my new engagement ring. The cleaner works well, but does leave a little bit of a sticky feeling on my hands and my ring despite rinsing repeatedly. The worst part about it though is that the cap does not seem to screw on securely and it is constantly leaking. I would not recommend this product because of this. I ordered a different brand of cleaner to replace it."
2,Useless,Jewelry came out just as bad as it went in. Toothbrush and toothpaste does a far better job. Waste of money.
2,No sparkle or shine,I bought this product to clean my silver jewelry. It cleaned it somewhat but I have had to put it in the cleaner more then once and for an extended period of time. Really not satisfied with the results. I would not recommend this product.
1,Did not work,"This product did not clean my silver jewelry at all. Looked the same when it came out of the basket. I tried to use a brush and cloth, but nothing worked. I bought this product thinking it was the Blitz jewelry cloths (those actually work well). I will never buy the liquid again."
1,Not Great,I ordered this cleaner for a pair of silver earrings that were tarnishing. I followed the instructions on the package and the tarnish did not go away. This cleaner does not work well and I would not recommend it.
2,not happy with the results,"not happy at all with the results, I got this item to clean my silver, I have no idea if i got the wrong one ... I used to have one silver cleaner and once i dip the silver and in 5 sec looked like new, anyway I should read more reviews before purchase it, thanks"
2,Does This Even Work?,"I saw all the positive reviews so I bought this cleaner. It is odorless, but it hasn't been able to clean any of my sterling silver jewelry! I followed the directions and my jewelry is still dull looking. I paid a lot for this cleaner and shipping it to me cost as much as the cleaner itself! Talk about frustrated and disappointed. Next time, I will buy a cleaner from an area variety store. It can't be any worse as far as effectiveness and this way I can return it in person should it not work."
2,Should have known,This product for starters - once opened LEAKS!. The cleaning is mediocre. Not worth it. Thank god it was only a few bucks.
5,Wedding ring bliss,"I got tired of running out to the jewelers to have my wedding rings cleaned. So I nervously searched for a jewelery cleaner to have on hand at home. I'm happy to say that this cleaner works wonders on the intricate detailing and diamonds of my wedding set without harsh chemical smells. The instructions clearly state which precious metals and gems are compatible with this specific cleaner. Also, I have very sensitive skin, and I have no problems using my bare hands with this product."
3,What One Might Expect,"Product arrived in good shape and reasonable time. What can one say about jewelry cleaner? It cleaned my jewelry. The brush was too soft to accomplish anything, but anyone who gets his/her teeth cleaned on a regular schedule has too many old toothbrushes hanging around anyway. I just used one of those."
3,Works so so,"I have used this on a few pieces of jewelry. It works alright, but the items you put in certainly don't come out sparkling. You then have to scrub them a bit or use a tarnish cloth."
2,blitz jewelry cleaner,"the cleaner works fine but the jar it comes in is not well made and it is difficult to open and close. It makes a mess every time I use it. The last jar I had was made from better material, but this is just junk!!! I will not purchase this item again."
1,Not correctly described,"Blitz 8 Oz Jewelry Cleaner with Cleaning BasketThe product is described as a jewelry cleaner, but there is no mention of the fact that it does not clean silver jewelry. As I bought it to clean silver jewelry, it is totally useless, so the money I spent was thrown away. So now I know Amazon's product descriptions are not always as complete as they should be. Glad I learned the lesson on a small item."
1,Does not work!,"I used this solution on all my silver necklaces and it didn't do a thing. They look exactly the same. I don't know if the one I got was the wrong formula, but I now need to buy something else."
2,"Works, but doesn't last very long.","Used it for a brief time as a goalie. Pretty much every piece in these suspenders is made out of metal that rusts very quickly. The adjustable clamps rusted shut, and the bolts that holds the loops at the bottom together fell apart making it unusable."
2,Undead and Unappreciated,A one day (afternoon or evening) read. Definitely not as entertaining as either of the first two. Should have waited for the paperback and then donated it to the public library.
2,Undead and Unimaginative,"This series is... cute. The first two books managed to be cute AND have a plot. This one seems to have been phoned in. I would have given it another star, but it really did not deserve to be in hardback. There is already another one slated to come out in hardback and I will wait for the paperback... and I probably won't be in a rush for that one either. For wacky, stick with Katie MacAlister, for off-beat, Charlaine Harris (worth the hardback price), for funny and sensual, Sherrilyn Kenyon, for dark and over the top sex, Laurell K. Hamilton, for a bit of everything, Kelley Armstrong. MaryJanice Davidson needs a little work... and a plot."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"I love the other books in this series, so was looking forward to reading this one.. it turned out to be somewhat disappointing.. not as fun as the other books and there did not seem to be a major antagonist ~ no villian to beat~ AND Betsy's continued rejection of Eric became very tedious (I mean, come on!!). What this book does well is set up plots for the next book.."
3,Not the best in the series.,"I adored the first two novels in this series by Davidson--Betsy was a scream. This one is a bit slower and lacked the excitment of the first two, however. Betsy is still great but the plot felt kind of cranked out. And I missed Marc and Tina here-they were MIA for most of the book. Reviews on the fourth installment seem to be even worse. This is probably my last book in this series."
2,Just eh. Passable,"Kinda disappointing, especially since Betsy is becoming more whiny, airheaded, and more unrealible person (save for the fiends), as opposed to the flighty spunky, common-sense yet sarcastic wit of a character we saw in the first two books. More and more becoming a real dumb-dumb blonde than blonde with a brain and shoe fetish. Seems like everything is becoming a fetish and flight of fancy for main character. Too bad characters are becoming more and more superficial in this book, rather than being fleshed out. Main character is a former secretary-model, and secretaries, by nature, are smart people who have much common sense and street smarts, but the you'd think she was only a model in her former life. If there rating were available in .25 increments, I'd have given it a 1.75-- so I rounded up."
3,Just okay,"Well, it wasn't as good as the first two - entertaining but disappointing, and I didn't think it was worth the hardcover purchase - better off to wait for the paperback unless one is a die-hard fan. Just for the sake of completeness, I'll probably buy the next installment due out in October, but I will definitely wait for the paperback. The plot was rather weak and did not make a great deal of sense, and Betsy was ditzier than usual. I won't spoil the plot for those who haven't read it; it kinda copped-out to a harlequin-type romance, though, towards the finish and I was left at the end of the day staring into the distance with what I am sure was a puzzled look on my face saying 'what? what?' and thinking that that was four hours of my life that I'll never get back."
3,Wait till it comes out in paperback!,I have to confess this book wasn't as great as I'd hoped it to be. Don't get me wrong I loved her first books two books but this one was missing something. I would have liked it if Betsy had some more evil vampire butt kicking scenes. Not to mention that whole thing with the devil was kind of confusing. Plus I'm still kinda of sore for having to buy the book in hardcover instead of paperback. My advice is to you if you're a true fan...wait it comes out in paperback.
1,Boring book - no plot,"UGH! This book was awful - even for a summer beach read. I would not waste my time again on this book. Cute concept, cute characters, but zero plot. BORING!"
2,Disappointing,"When I picked up this book I was delighted, especially if it were like the other 2 books - Undead and Unwed and Undead and Unemployed. Oh, how I loved and adored Queen Betsy and found her ditzyness to be hilarious- in the other 2 books.This book brought much disappointment to me - I felt that it did not have a real plot to the story and it was going no where fast. The story of Betsy and her stepmother is getting old to me. They fight - we get that! They hate each other - we get that! Lets get something else please - something totally unrelated to the stepmother.While I would recommend Undead and Unwed - that one is hysterical!! I would not waste my time again by reading this book. It went no where fast and continued going no where.Please go back to developing the characters and DIFFERENT situations that Betsy the vampire queen can get herself into trouble - I am really bored with the family drama - an ""undead"" girl should just be able to get over and move on with her undead life."
3,Wait for the paperback,"I love the ""Undead"" series, but this one just isn't as good as the first two books. It's about the same length as the earlier books, yet it's a hardback. Did I like ""Undead and Unappreciated""? Yes! Enough to pay hardback prices? No! In fact, I bought the book, read it in under 2 hrs, was so disappointed in it that I took it right back to the store and got a refund! I'll be very happy to purchase a copy in paperback, but I think it's money thrown away to invest in the hardcover version. My suggestion, get a copy from the library to read, then buy a copy when the paperback is issued!"
3,Not as good as the others but still rather charming,"This series is about Betsy Taylor, a young woman who knows more about good shoes that anyone else. Unfortunately, in the first book, she dies suddenly, but quickly returns as queen of the vampires. As she rises, she is filled with rage as she realizes her stepmother has planned to bury her in cheap shoes. The story goes from there. It is very, very funny in places (though a bit raunchy, unfortunately, also). In the second book, we find Betsy looking for a job and going to work in a shoe department in a nice store. In this book, we find her tracking down a long lost sister who may be a threat to the entire world. Well, it is a lot weaker in plot than the others, but still has a certain charm. While I did not care for it so much, I will certainly read the next one."
4,Funny!,"Legally Blonde meets Twilight. Very campy funny. A great light hearted read that'll make you smile, giggle, and laugh."
2,Where's the rest of it?,"I found this third ""Undead"" book to be rather anti-climatic... or maybe non-climatic would be a better word. When I got to the end, all I could think was ""That's it? Am I missing pages? Were chapters left out of my ebook?"" Not a lot happens here. Basically, Betsy finds out she has a half-sister who's really the daughter of Satan, goes a little crazy after reading the Book of the Dead for too long and has to apologize to everyone, has one confrontation where she finds out some important facts about her new half-sister, and finally admits that she loves Sinclair. And... that's it. Maybe we find out more about this prophecy with her sister in the next book? All I know is that this one was pretty lacking."
4,still plenty of snark,"You know, much as I like MaryJanice Davidson's humor, I'm not so sure I like this as a series. The first book was fabulous, wonderful, but it seems to be floundering.I'm getting tired of Betsy's continued hot/cold reactions to Sinclair, and the big romantic revelation didn't ring true at all.The 4 stars is mostly for the snark and because I like Davidson's writing in general.I did enjoy the sister and the club employees' rebellion, but both plot threads were resolved way too easily.It's not necessary to sacrifice plot or depth for humor, and it feels as though that's what happened here. I'll still continue reading this series, but I'm going to start waiting for the paperbacks. It's just not worth getting in hardcover for me."
2,Started out as a promising series & quickly turned into mindless fluff,"The first book was wonderful, quirky & funny. It quickly became obvious that the author took advantage of its popularity and divided what should have been the next single book in the series into 2 books. The author filled these 2 books with so much mindless fluff and avoided the plot line so completely that I quickly decided there was no point in purchasing any more books in the series."
2,Disappointing,"The first two books in this series were funny, well written and although read very quickly, well worth waiting for. This, the third in the series, unfortunately seemed rushed and 'thin' on plot and characters. They are not large literary works, they are fun, happy books with a twist however, the author seems to be slipping, possibly complacent or bored? Shame."
3,A Bit Off,"I am a big fan of MJD and this is one of my favorite series. However, this one seems a bit off to me. It's still a quick enjoyable read, but not up to the standard of her previous ones. Betsy does some things out of character that I think take away from the series as a whole. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say this. Thus far her friends have meant everything to her, and her behavior towards them doesn't show it in this one. I am still looking forward to the next one, and will continue to recommend her books to everyone I meet."
2,"MaryJanice, what happened????","The first two Betsy Taylor books were short but packed with humor and action. I've re-read them both several times, and still love them. This one? It seems like she whipped it off in less than a month, and didn't put the care and craftsmanship into it that she did the others. The plot is thin, the characters far less developed, and the book is overall a disappointment, especially in light of how excellent her first two Vampire Queen books were. Sadly, the fourth book in the series, Undead and Unreturnable, is even worse. I advise anyone wanting to read either Unappreciated or Unreturnable to get them from the library--they are not worth buying. Try Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking instead, or Katie McAlister's You Slay Me if you want something lighter, and hope that MJD gets her act together and starts writing well again."
3,Feels more like a chapter than a book - especially for hardcover,"I enjoy this series of books. They're funny, quirky, and I generally get a kick out of them. I liked this one, too, but it really felt much more like an installment than a whole book. If it were in paperback, that would have been OK. To pay for hardcover, however, it was a huge disappointment. This book really just felt like a set-up for the next part of the series. Again, that's OK - it was still funny - but there was little in the way of climax or plot. I wouldn't have minded this NEAR as much had it been in paperback. My advice - you'll want to read it if you're into the series - but it's worth the wait for the paperback. Ah, well. Gee, can you tell I'm sorry I paid for hardcover??? :)"
2,Wait for the paperback,"Like most of the people writing these reviews, I loved the first two books in this series. When I found out the 3rd was coming out in hardcover I was a little surprised.Well, I bought it and all I can think of was ""I paid how much for this?"" I couldn't believe how air -headed and very spoiled Betsy has become. She basically doesn't think throughout the entire story. While there were still funny parts, I almost had to force myself to finish this book. Ms. Davidson usually does much better than this.So, if you must have a copy, like I said in my title, wait for the paperback version."
1,JUST ANOTHER TOO STUPID TO LIVE HEROINE,"I'm through with reading Davidson. I kept hoping some potential would start appearing in her stuff, but have given up hope. The female lead is stupid, the male lead all knowing, the secondary characters annoying. And let me just say here, Sex in the City was a wildly amusing show but it did women NO FAVORS when it comes to portraying them as incredibly shallow, fashion-and-shoe-obsessing idiots. Now, due to the show's popularity, everyone and her sister is writing about shoes! Give me a break! That was funny a few times on the show (and even that got old!). That's OVER NOW! I've decided it must be asking too much of JD to give us a clever plot line and female lead. She must be incapable of it, so I won't be trying anymore!"
4,Very funny,I always enjoy reading MaryJanice Davidson's vampire series because I find her so hilarious. I read parts to my daughter when she hears me cracking up laughing on the couch and looks at me funny. I just wish she would skip the other series of books and write this one faster.
3,Funny enough for a vampire fan.,"I thought this book had some very funny moments. The character kind of reminds me of Carrie from Sex and the City as far as the fashion goes.Though, I thought this book would be more like D.N. Simmons's Knights of the Darkness Chronicles or Charlaine Harris's series. I thought to plots would be just as exciting and sexy as well as the characters.I have nothing against the ""lighter"" tone of the vampire genre. This book was funny where it was supposed to be. I would however, highly recommend fans of MJD to D.N.Simmons. Her series is also extremely funny but more edgier and sexy."
5,Great read.,"I love this series. Everytime a new title gets out, it takes me a while before given in and bying it but so far it's been worth it. The author as a great way of telling the story and her humour and sarcastic wit is always dead on."
3,A VERY Short Read,"This felt more like a short story than a novel. I literally finished it in one lunch hour and felt very short changed given that I paid full price for the hardback. The story was not as well developed as previous ""Undead"" stories, but had Ms. Davidson's signature quirks and humor. If you must read it, wait for the paperback. I do enjoy Ms. Davidson's sense of humor and the heroine's love of shoes, but felt that she could have spent a little more time developing the new characters introduced."
2,Not everyone can write awesome books every time out,"I was entertained for a couple hours, but felt like the book was just lacking. Maybe because this book was a hardback, I had greater expectations. I feel a bit ripped off, because even as a small hardback, the pages had large margins and large print. This would even make a tiny paperback.As much as I look forward to the books in the ""Undead"" series, I would be happier to wait a little bit longer if it meant I got a story that was more fleshed out. I have grown to embrace all the characters in the series, and felt that this book did a disservice to them.Despite that, I am still looking forward to the next one."
2,Undead and unfullfilling,"It was nice to read as a continuation of the plot, but it probably could have been skipped. The only thing this book added was Betsy's sister, daughter of the devil, and that only superficially.There was the normal ""Kill Betsy"" attempt, but no great advancement in the story line. It was a real disappointment. Hopefully the next one has more to it."
2,Dead-ly boring,"I am so disappointed. The first 2 in the series were absolutely hilarious. They moved quickly, were witty and highly entertaining. Even my brothers were in stitches, laughing at the shoe humor and all. This one is a shadow of the style from the first ones. It's as though someone was imitating Ms. Davidson's style, and falling woefully short. I pre-ordered this and the next in the series but I think I might cancel the order for the next. If you haven't gotten any of these yet, definately get the first 2 and bypass this one."
2,Where's the story????,"I have to admit I may feel this way because I've started in the middle of the series but this book just felt like filler... like the author needed to get a book out and this is what we got. Nothing really happened. Besty read a book and went crazy for a while, met her half sister and realized she loves Sinclair. Ok. What now? I'm starting the next book, now... hopefully it will feel more like a novel."
3,Disappointing,"The first two books in this series were laugh out loud funny and highly entertaining. Unfortunately, the author seems to be on automatic pilot through the first three-quarters of this novel, when the reader is subjected to unfunny and tedious whining from Betsy, Queen of the Vampires, and very little in the way of wit, action, and plot. Only toward the end does the reader find some of the snappy dialog and amusing characters that we have come to expect from MJD.Hopefully, the author will spend more time on the next installment of Betsy's adventures -- the addition of her half-sister, spawn of the devil, should prove most interesting."
4,Nice Headset,"The editorial review is misleading. It does NOT have a 2.5 mm jack, but a propritory Ericsson connector...Works nice with my T68m. I especially like the Answer button so I never have to look for the YES key on the phone, and it can be safely tucked away in my coat pocket (I keep the phone on Vibrate, as the Ring volume is not that loud).Watch out for the flimsy design as the plastic edge can break if not handled carefully (one way SONY-Ericsson keeps you coming back for more....)"
4,Dynamic Duo,"These guys really compliment each other well. Neither instrument overpowers the other, creating a well balanced listening experience."
5,all three are great,Abarat is great. It is almost worth getting for the pictures but it is good anyway. City of the Beast is my favorite of the three. There is the story of the people as well as them together. It is an interesring story that can make you think if you want it to. My least favorite of the three was Coraline because I don't like horror stories. It was still worth reading. It was a story I would recommend to people who like fantasy/horror. I would recommend all three of these.
5,Buen libro,Libro llego en rápido en muy buen estado. Se recomienda la compra en un 100 %. Además el libro es bueno.
3,Bal-A-Vis-X,"This book has good information, but, as parent I need more visual information, Pictures and step by step information."
2,Not for just a few pounds...,"I tried this product hoping to get that extra boost I needed to shed those last 5 pounds. While I did feel a slight boost of energy, this product did nothing to increase amount of weight I was losing in addition to my already established routine. Although I will say to this product's credit, it did do a decent job of curbing my appetite throughout the day."
3,Trimspa,This is pretty good. My hunger is no longer overbearing and I can make it until lunch without feeling like I'm going to die!
2,Major Disappointment,Handle is hollow ... when chopping if feels like you are hitting wood with a piece of pvc pipe and cuts about as well .... had to constantly sharpen soft steel blade
4,YEAH!,"This axe is the shht. The technology is awesome. Feels great in your hand. Perfect size to strap onto the side of a Yakima LoadWarrior basket. It chops great. Highly recommended by Ax Men, which is right down the street from me...YEAH!"
4,awesome quality,the quality issuperb.great size and weight. would make an awesome giftand it can preparesomeone for the apocalypse if u feel me
2,"""virtually unbreakable""... sure...","Had this axe for about 3 weeks. It worked quite well for splitting wood, up until the 'stronger than steel' handle shattered. Wasn't even a bad hit- A normal blow, straight on the blade.Maybe mine was a defect. I dunno. Up until it broke, I was quite pleased with it."
4,Perfect size for camping - excellent sheath provided,The axe came with a finely sharpened edge and is the right weight for light cutting jobs. I wanted something one step up from a hatchet for use in cutting up wood for a campfire and this axe is perfect. The curved end of the handle helps to grip it with such a short handle and have more control.The steel used is engineered for ease of sharpening and not long term durability if you plan on hitting nails or other foreign objects. I prefer this as it makes it faster to reset and edge in the field without taking a lot of time.I had overlooked the plastic sheath provided and it is an excellent design and better than the leather ones which in my experience develop a mold covering if not oiled regularly. The integrated hanging loop is also good if you want to hang it up in a garage or shed.
5,Great axe,This Axe is sharp and lightwheight. It chops medium sized trees with ease. The handle is very compact but light. I was satisfied instantly with my purchase. I strongly recommend this axe.
3,Cheap and okay,"How much will you use this thing?For the money, it's okay. It cuts things... slowly. The handle is guaranteed forever, but I kind of wish it would break, because the blade is cheap and dulls quickly.Honestly the looks are what sold me, but after using it a few times I would recommend splurging for a nicer axe."
5,outdoor lover,This axe is the real deal.Ive used it alot and it is easy to get the razor sharp blade back to new with minimal effort.It cant be beat for the price.If i had a buget of 40 and needed to bet my life on a survival tool in the backcountry this would be it.
1,The sound is not good,"Although the sound of this CD is not good (in fact, it is awful) what surprises me the most is the quality of the CD itself. Labels like ""Seeco"", ""West Side"" and many others are nowadays using CD-R to sell their products, which I consider a way of cheating the customer. CD-R like those produced by these labels I can find in my country at a very low price (let's say U.S.$1,0)and they are known as ""Pirate records"". Very sad this situation with these unconscious CD producers."
2,I was hoping for more...,"Best page of the book is 254, the list of milk and dairy byproduct names to help you decipher the product labels.Almost 100 pages are devoted to breads and desserts. So I guess if you can't have dairy, you can still get fat. Quite a few of the recipes have the ""duh"" factor...salads and things you hardly need a recipe for. Substituting mocha mix for regular milk in normal recipes...""duh"".What I would love to find, is a book that tells me how to make non-dairy versions of ubiquitous ingredients. Like a non-dairy substitute for a can of cream of mushroom soup."
1,Cooking Without Milk,"This cook book is terrible and provides no new information or recipes. There is one recipe that is given for a Fruit Salad and then includes onions and other vegetables, clearly a typo. I would not suggest this book."
5,Fine Movie,"This is a quiet, understated movie that is just excellent. I had never heard of this movie before, but just finished watching it on Lifetime TV. It IS a quiet gem as one of the other reviewers stated. I felt moved enough to log onto amazon and read some reviews.As usual, the poignant, quiet films that say much in an understated fashion go unnoticed. What a shame. This is another keeper."
2,The slowest movie I've ever seen.,"Personal Effects starring Ashton Kutcher and Michelle Pfeiffer starts off as a promising drama but falls apart after the first hour. I hate to say it, but this movie is incredibly slow and overwrought. I usually enjoy Kutcher in a dramatic performance but I found his awkwardness rather distracting, his sensitivity failed him this time around. Pfeiffer gives another stellar performance but the romance between her and Kutcher just never clicked with me. Personal Effects was the longest 2 hours of my life, good story... just not much to praise."
3,Personal Effects,"For the excellent actors, the money was somewhat disappointing.Ashton Kutcher is my favorite but this was early in his career."
1,This is a terrible movie,"I guess the fact that it has 2 reviews as of writing says enough, but honestly, I think Kutcher had a hand in making this movie because it is terrible. The people are all tied up in vengance, anger, and steeped in selfishness. The characters are the kind of people I see in line in wal-mart that make me struggle with self righteousness, and i can't bring myself to care about them at all, much less for the sake of the lame story."
3,Ashton Kutcher Is A Better Actor Than Shown Here,"The story has great possibilities, but didn't seem to get 'there' .I don't think any Actor and/or Director can make a screenplay any better than it really is.If you are in the mood for a 'just okay' film, then here's one."
3,Great little fridge,"The good: Keeps drinks cold, small outside, big (relatively) inside, Very quiet operation, comes with dc cord and 12v car cord, has removable drawers inside(2 shelves and 2 bins on door) 20 cans of soda fit perfectly, lightweight and has a lock on the door, fit and finish and material quality is very good.The Bad: Takes about 4 hours to cool a full load of cans, internal air vent is central, so theres only one spot where cold air cools the fridge, and lastly, it may not be practical for larger bottles.Update: Changed to 4 stars, because it only lasted 14 months."
1,Worked Great.. Until it Broke after 7 months,"This fridge worked as advertised...although it is quite small. If you are chilling cans it is great, but there is no room for bottles or other tall items. However, after 7 months of constant use, it stopped working...just died one day. Spend your money on a regular compact fridge unless you don't plan to use it very often."
3,Great Mini Fridge but it died after 8 months.,"Great Mini Fridge with room for a 6 pack, or two 2-liter bottles with a few snacks. It also comes with removable shelves and floor for easy cleanup. I used this Mini Fridge under my work desk and was quite pleased for roughly 8 months of non-stop usage.During that time, I cleaned it regularly and periodically used compressed air to keep the air intake and cooling vents free of dust.One day, it just stopped cooling. The fans inside the fridge continued to work and the green cool light was illuminated.My adorable little fridge was no more. As stated in a previous review, I don't think this Mini Refrigerator was intended for constant use. The warmer feature still works so I won't toss it yet. The Fridge was good wile it lasted but I don't plan to buy another one. .I will try a different maker, maybe I'll have better luck."
4,Good for Research,This is a very useful book if it for a Roman Research paper; people might consider it fun to read but it is more for just strait on notes.
5,Showcase of New Music,"A City Called Heaven showcases six accomplished contemporary African-American voices: Olly Wilson, Alvin Singleton, Wendell Logan, Tania Leon, T. J. Anderson, and Anthony Davis. Though sharing the common link of the African Diaspora, this is an eclectic collection borrowing from many cultural legacies.My favorite piece is Anthony Davis' ""Wayang II"" (Shadow Dance.) Its multiple and contstantly changing layers of melody, metrical settings and tempi are mesmerizing, a kaleidoscope of sound.Now I must confess I'm not generally a big fan of post modern music; I prefer to listen and enjoy with my ears first and my brain second. (In other words, I prefer melody.) But I'm sure anyone who does like this sort of music will be impressed and pleased by what they find here, and especially by the performances of Thamyris, Atlanta's internationally famous contemporary music ensemble."
1,What?,"How can this possibly be called their greatest hits when ""Fallen in Love"" isn't even on the CD? I did not purchase this CD for that reason!"
1,Next to no Winners Here,"With the exception of ""Don't Pull Your Love"" this release is a dud. Weather Hamilton, Joe Frank and Reynolds or Dennison, two of their three biggest hits aren't even on the album. What would Dick Clark say, since whoever the group was at the time was featured on American Bandstand playing those tunes. And we all know what those two songs were! And as far as I know most of the rest of these cuts weren't even hits, much less singles. Maybe I'll do a review on Emerson, Lake and Palmer...or Powell. Tomatoe, Tomato."
1,"Not Worth ""Don't Pull your Love""","My rating: 1.2/5 Only because I like ""Don't pull your love""This is a one song album. ""Don't pull your love"" first attracted me to this group for it's good tempo, Elvis like melody and lyrics with the Grass Roots horns flying in the background. It is a nice peppy song. Unfortunately this song is not typical for the album. ""One good woman"" is a decent song partly because the instrumental chorus sounds like it's been stolen from ""Grease."" Most of the songs have the Grass Roots horns, but they begin to sound more and more like Three Dog Night with a little bit country.Overall I feel like this group strains to fit a melody to their instruments, only slightly more than it struggles to find it's own sound. This is a one hit wonder group and an album not worth the money. The final straw to break this reviewers back was their defacing rendition of ""Bridge Over Troubled Water:"" a horrible cover of a wonderful song."
2,Title not Misleading,"Winners and Losers and Fallin in Love were by Hamilton, Joe Frank, and Dennison and were recorded 3 years after Reynolds left the band in 1972. Perhaps a Best of Hamilton, Joe Frank, and Dennison CD would be a better seller!"
2,Hamilton Joe Frank And Reynolds - Greastest Hits,"The music on this CD is great. The songs assembled, show very little of what the band is like. They were first known as Hamilton Joe Frank And Reynolds and the were also known as Hamilton Joe Frank And Dennison. The Latter was very good as well. With both band names, they did five records all together. All records were done on Playboy Records and were bought out by MCA Records when Playboy records went out of business. They have enough songs to do a Double CD greatest Hits or if they could locate some unreleased tracks and live recorded material; there could be a real nice three CD Greatest Hits."
2,Two of my favorite seventies songs aren't here,"It was really disappointing that this Hamilton,Joe Frank & Reynolds Greatest Hits Collection didn't include two of my favorite songs from the seventies. How could they call it Greatest Hits when a number one song called Fallin in Love and a top twenty song called Winners and Losers weren't considered for this album?Great lyrics,sweet songs,harmonious voices.Thats what they were,an unforgettable group of the seventies.Missing these songs was an unfortunate mistake."
4,"Here's where to find ""Fallin in Love""","When I was about 13 (way, way back in the last millennium!) I had a horrible, all-consuming crush on a gorgeous guy 2 years my senior. When Fallin' in Love was played as the ""slow skate"" song at the local skating rink, He (with a capital H!) took my hand and we skated and I thought I would die on the spot! Where is he now? I have absolutely no idea, but I still love that wonderful song! You can find it by going to ktel.com and creating a customized CD. You'll probably find a zillion other singles to put on a CD that have that strange transporting power back to your Important Moments as well! Enjoy!"
1,Greatest Hits?????,"How can they call this a greatest hits album when they didn't include ""Winners and Losers"" and ""Falling in Love."" Two of their biggest hits. The album ""Falling in Love"" has more of their hits on it then this peice of junk. To bad Amazon doesn't carry it."
3,"""Fallin In Love"" IS available on CD!!!!!!","This CD did not have one of their greatest hits, ""Falling In Love"".That song can be found on Rhino's ""Billboard Top Hits 1975"".Get this CD & Rhino's then you'll have their two greatest hits!!!Both together make it a five star collection."

2,Don't waste your money,"Me encanta Perales como compositor y por esto compre este disco pero los nuevos arreglos de sus exitos son basicos y malos. Su primera cancion ""Porque te vas"" no tiene casi instrumentos y pues a decir verdad su voz no es que sea de las mas bonitas, Parecia mi abuelito cantando. Adoro a Perales pero esta recopilacion es una perdedera de dinero."
5,"old, but still a reference book","This book may be over 20 years old, but several of its papers have been extremely widespread, and it still serves as a reference point. Highly recommended for methodologists and people interested in participatory design."
1,"I don't have the item, I was suppose to have by 10/29/09","I have been waiting and waiting on this bumper sticker. My boyfriend is a big Giants fan. I ordered miscellaneous Giants items form different companies, I have all the other items from other companies but I am still waiting on the bumper sticker I bought from this company. When I try to track it stills shows ""In Transit"". I don't even have a number to call the company to find out what is the problem. My boyfriends birthday is Monday, November 9, 2009 and I plan on giving him all of his Giants stuff, I guess he won't have this. If it happens to come after Monday, 11/09/09, I am going to send it back and request a refund! This is awful I will never order from this company again!"
2,not bright enough,"I bought these and really like them, but I had them in the sun all day and when night comes they are not bright at all, they just light up enough to see where you may walk down steps or a path. Do not expect show off your house or a fountain."
4,2nd in Dalemark Series,"This book, the second in the Dalemark Quartet, seemed a little weaker than the other three. It was much better than many books I have read, though, and I recommend it.Mitt lives in Southern Dalemark, in an earldom run by a mean guy. His father is betrayed, and Mitt dedicates his time and talents to get his revenge. Very good, as all Diana Wynne Jones' books are!"
3,Time to put this horse to pasture,"The definitive reference for home games, this particular edition covers everything from Poker to Scrabble (the gaming juggernaut of the time) to Old Maid to Chess to Canasta. Nostalgia is probably the only reason to get this edition; in it's day, it was comprehensive but by now, many of the games listed have fallen out of public favor, while new games have been invented. The advice on winning play for each game is helpful, but also fairly basic for any enthusiast. I suppose the only reason to get this book is if you're collecting Hoyle books, or game books. It's intrinsic value has diminished over the years."
4,Breve historia de los Argentinos,"Una vez mas, Felix Luna logra exponer en forma amena y sencilla una historia complicada y muchas veces confusa.El autor trata honestamente de ser lo mas objetivo posible y lo logra en la mayoria del texto.La forma en la cual divide los capitulos/secciones atraves de la historia Argentina es sumamente acertada. Es un libro excelente para un repaso general y para fijar en la memoria acontecimientos y momentos importantes de la historia argentina. Logra encadenar los acontecimientos importantes otorgando fluidez al relato en general."
5,Old time gospel revival,"His Hand in Mine is a sacred Holy Spirit filled hymn, whose music and words revive both body and soul.Although the sheet music was used and worn, it's worth remains priceless as it will continue to blessthroughout the ages."
1,Totally misleading!,"Serious warning for all prospective readers of this book: this is the most misleading title ever created. This book has almost nothing about about the July 20,1944 bomb plot by Count von Staufenberg against Hitler. Of course you'd think this would be about that topic since the title mentions this event. Forget it! Instead, it's a lengthy, boring and ultimately unreadable account of the German Home Front in 1944-45. That's a fairly interesting subject, but not when you expect to read something about July 20, 1944. I didn't even finish this twaddle, Hitler appears on a scant 14 pages, Staufenberg is a non-entity here. A crushing disappointment."
1,A Wasted Opportunity.,"I can only reinforce the misgivings of the earlier reviewers.The author postulates that the failure of the German Army to field a large number of new divisions in early 1944 was a deliberate attempt to hold back manpower from the front for an internal coup to accompany the Bomb Plot in July 1944.However, he then fails completely to offer any evidence of a causal connection. As a result, on its central theme this book is closer to conspiracy theory than history.This is a pity, as the German Replacement Army was a major military institution that badly needs a good study. This disappointing book is very definitely not it."
2,Low Budget,"Unfortunately, I believe that this book had great potential, but fell short of delivering. The book contains a good deal of interesting info, but all of this info can be found on the Internet for free. The information on the Internet is a good deal more detailed though. This book should have been proofed by someone who owns an LS1 engine..."
2,"Hmmm, better stuff available online","This is an interesting book, but you'd have to be mad to pay for it. Some of the information reads like it was made up, as others have suggested, and, for owners of LS1 engines here in Oz, your best bet is the following website: [...]Basically, there's better information on bolt-ons online, and, for readers here in Oz, the book is too 'foreign-sounding' , which is grating to us. Further, personal opinions by authors of ostensible 'DIY manuals' is not a good look. Some of the historical detail is interesting, but best left for a study on the evolution of the 350 Chev to the LS1. A 'DIY Manual' wants 2 things: clear pictures, and point-form instructions.Bottom line: If this is all that's available in print, better stick to the web."
2,Fun toy but not a good potty,"My daughter has no idea what to think of this potty. It is a TOY! I completely agree with what others said.. it is a wonderful toy, but its purpose (to be a potty) is ignored by the child b/c they are having too much fun playing! I also agree it is way to sensitive. My daughter will just lift up the seat and it says ""you did it! You went potty!""I do not recommend this potty for potty training. Go with a simple, non-toy version of the potty!"
5,GREAT!!!,My son is just 15 months and already shows an interest in the potty.. He loves to sit on it and then get up and flush it!! I believe it wont be long before he is ready to use it!! Great Potty Chair!!!!!
2,Better if you turn off the sound!,"We bought two different Fisher Price potties- one for upstairs and one for downstairs- just in case :) This model is way too sensitive. If my son so much as twicthed, the potty told him he had successfully peed. In the beginning, he thought he was pretty hot stuff! Finally, I turned the thing off and he just sat on it and told me on his own when he was done. The other bad thing is that the splash guard comes off way too easily. Every time I'd turn around, my son would have the thing in his hand which is not a good thing when training a boy! My son has rather generous thighs and when I'd get him off the potty, the splash guard would come too!"
4,Cool Potty For The Most Part,We are just starting to potty train my son and he loves all the noises it makes. He gets so excited with the music. My only complaint hence why I gave it 4 stars is because the music starts right when the child sits down. It says you did it even though they did nothing. I wish it would wait and reward the child once they have done there business. All in all it is a good potty. I would still purchase it again.
2,It's A Potty TOY,This is a very fun TOY. It is not a good potty! My son likes to find things to put into it to hear it sing. The pee guard comes out way to easy and for some reasone a child can lift the white part of the seat and slam it on their fingers.All in all it sings fun songs and it would be a fun toy. We ended up returning this and getting the baby bijorn potty. Works like a potty not a toy.
2,dangerous dissapointment,We purchased this potty for my 21 month old daughter yesterday because her favorite thing about the potty is the handle. She was very dissapointed that it didn't make a real flushing sound. Because she is a girl we do not use the splash guard and that leaves a hole in the blue lid where there is room for the guard to pertrude. She stuck her hand in the hole and was not able to get it out. We had to pull her hand out leaving a scratch and a bruise on her hand. While the concept of this potty was a great one it was poorly executed.
2,I wish I hadn't wasted the money,"I agree with all of the other reviews about this product, in that it was cute and had some neat features (sounds, etc). However, my son is tall and he was uncomfortable with having to sit at an awkward angle. Now for the sound effects: each time that my son lifted the lid to ""go"" it said that he had already gone or made some other ghastly comment and the guard would fall off. Given what I now know, I would recommend that people get a potty seat from the One Step Ahead site- the products have really helped my son and they are so much cheaper then my new glorified stool!"
2,NOT FOR BOYS!!!!!,"This is the worst potty for boys.It is really small so my 3 year old barely fits on it.He has been forced to urinate standing up (which I guess is best in the long run) because the shield squishes his parts!!!and now he is afraid of getting hurt.The potty is not made well for boys nor does it take into consideration ""aim"" or lack of it. When my son urinates, if he doesn't get it all directly in the green pan, it leaks from in between the seat on to the floor and in between the base of the potty. This thing is disgusting. I have to take it apart and clean it every single time he pees!!!!Also, the sensor is too sensitive. It sings and says he went when nothing happened.I wish I would have spent the money on a simple potty without bells and whistles. Now all my 1 year old wants to do is play with this nasty potty. I finally threw it away and just let my son use the regular toilet."
1,Not a good one,"I can't even use this chair with my son. The plastic seat is way too hard for him to sit on for more than a few minutes. (go buy a cheaper one that has a cushion type seat). The music is wayy to loud, the sensor is way too sensitive, and its way too obnoxious. He hates it, and so do I."
4,great for my son,I love this potty chair as it works wonders for my son..He is only 18 months old and not just yet ready to be potty trained yet but he has used it twice..He plays with it all the time
2,More like a toy,My daughter thinks of this potty more as a toy than a potty. She refuses to use it for anything else. Maybe there's too many distractions and bells and whistles with this product. It looks nice though!
2,Not a fan of this thing!,"My kids want to play in it but don't want to sit on it. The music is very loud and the sensor turns the voice that says ""you went potty"" on when little hands go into the bowl. This encourages kids to touch the inside of the bowl, not exactly tidy. Get a Baby Bjorn. This thing is going out in the next yard sale!"
2,Misleading to kids,"We're just starting to acclimate my 20 mo. old with using the potty. I agree with those who wrote about the oversensitive sensor on the potty chair. Every time my daughter sits on the potty it tells her ""way to go- you did it"" when in fact she hasn't gone at all. I think the toilet paper and flush have definately helped make her fearless about using the regular potty, but when it comes time for serious training, I'm going to have to turn the sound off because it is so misleading. She's had more success the few times she has sat on the regular toilet- this is indeed an expensive toy!"
3,"Toilet is ok, but electronics need work!","My son took to the potty like a pro. However, it can't seem to make up it's mind if the lid is up or down. Plus, he has figured out that he can spin the toilet paper roll to make it sing even when he has not gone potty, thereby unjustly rewarding him for something he did not do, therefor breaking the training regime for which the potty was designed."
2,"ok potty seat, wouldn't buy again","I agree with other comments regarding ""Noise"" being distracting. My son is 5 years old and still loves to use this potty WITHOUT it turned on! My biggest complaint is it is IMPOSSIBLE to keep all the little nooks and crannies clean and at this point I am ready to throw it in the trash as it stinks!!! The urine gets trapped around all the sensor parts and there are so many crevices that it's impossible to clean them thoroughly every time one of my 2 kids uses the potty! Not a good investment and would definitely not buy it again. My recommendation to anyone looking for a potty seat, KEEP IT SIMPLE!"
2,"Fun Toy, but Not the Best Potty Training Device...",We have had this potty for close to a year and all my nearly 3 year old son will do is play with it. He figured out how to fool the sensors in the potty and sticks his hand between his legs to get it to talk back to him. The splash guard is worthless as it comes off too easily and makes it difficult for my son to sit down without sitting on it. Might be a good idea for a girl or a child that refuses a plain potty.
1,Be Careful of this Potty!!!,"I bought this potty seat for my son and when I put the batteries in it the batteries (which were brand new) the back of the battery compartment got dangeroulsy hot and when I opened it to take the batteries out the batteries were exploding! I am returning it where I purchased it. Unless this was a defective one, I would not recommend this at all."
2,Skip this and go with a basic potty cover,"This plays nice songs and is a fun TOY, but I wouldn't recommend it if you are serous about potty training. While the seat and back can be removed from the base to attach to a toilet, we found that it either doesn't attach well and slides around (depending on your toilet size and shape) or it attaches so well (to a standard size toilet) that it's a pain to undo it so an adult can use the toilet. You need to reach in and squeeze four clips one at a time to release it from the toilet. Also, it takes up a bit of floor space, so if you have a small bathoom, you'll be tripping over this (plus a stool)."
2,distracting and confusing,"We thought this potty would be nice because it looks more like a real potty than some of the others. But like others have experienced, my daughter has more fun playing with it than sitting on it. The first time my daughter communicated the need to go potty, she sat on it for a few seconds, then got off to play with it. She ended up going potty on the floor right next to it, which scared her and I think slowed her potty training progress.Also, even when she is just sitting on the potty, the sensor is constantly going off and telling her she went potty when she didn't. How confusing! I may go out and buy a Baby Bjorn to replace this thing.=========Update: I did buy a Baby Bjorn potty, but my daughter really did love playing with the Fisher Price potty, and once she got old enough, it was the one she wanted to use. So maybe it's not so bad after all, despite its quirks."
4,Lots of Fun,"This potty chair was bit more expensive than I wanted to pay, but my daughter refused to sit on one of the small simple potty seats and was afraid of our toilet seat. We are almost completely potty trained and this potty chair is the reason why! It does talk and it can be loud, but if you child is past the step of ""being shy to the potty"", it's perfect. It has a sensor in it and if she sits on when the pee hits the potty, it says encouraging words like you've been on the potty. It tells her when the seat is up or down and tells her to find the toilet paper and flush it all away. She was really excited about it.The only downside is that it can be considered play time if your child isn't quite ready for it.I was on here today looking for a potty seat to put on our toilet with handles... I totally forgot or did not realize that I could put this seat on our big toilet. :)It's another good product by Fisher Price."
3,Probably OK,I am unsure of how to work this properly. It is not intuitive. It tells you in the directions that it takes awhile to get used to. But I find myself going back to my old straightener instead of taking the time to make it work the way I would like.
4,a gift,I bought it as a gift for one if my coworkers n she loves the curls that it gives to here clients.
3,Excellent for the Stupid Tourist,"I brought this book to Poland with me, and it proved invaluable to someone like me who only spoke ""stupid tourist"" Polish. I went to the country knowing virtually nothing about the language, and the book proved invaluable in making simple, stilted communication. Without the book I would have been completely lost. The phonetic pronunciation proves invaluable for a language like Polish where the words don't sound like they look (to a stupid tourist like me).My one complaint was the occasional presentation of very important words with supplemental information about why the word is important, but without any phonetic pronunciation. The words are essentially useless if you don't know how to say them, and in Polish, that's pretty much all the time. Other than these occasional oversights, the book does a pretty good job of guiding you through the language for basic survival."
4,Good starting point,"I bought this book a few days ago knowing zero Polish. I like this book as it does a great job with phonetical spelling, making it very easy to figure out how to pronounce the words. It's also a good pocket size that you can take with you anywhere if you have a few extra moments to practice on the bus or eating a burrito or something. My goal with this book is to get something that was useful and just allow me to just get an initial foothold in the language that I'll supplement with a more in-depth course. In that regard, it's been great. I already have the basic phrases down. Plus, it's cheap!"
1,Just awful...,"I bought this set really looking forward to it and ended up severely disappointed. More attention goes into the screenplay of a porno than into the scripted antics of this show.It would be great to see an actual porn-related reality show. But this was just a bunch of one-dimensional scripted nonsense. Hey- the director! And his cousin! His mom too, what??? These people on the show probably lead interesting and sometimes dramatic lives. But every little staged event and posturing was just annoying.They should have just turned on the cameras and let these people be themselves. When a porn-related reality show sucks, well that's pretty bad. They didn't even throw in enough gratuitous nudity or sex to keep the show watchable. But, garsh! It's cousin Stevie running around being a moron! Again!"
2,"this is ""not"" reality","Hi, I have been waiting to watch this show for along time and was very dissapointed. Everything had been scripted from the cousin wearing a seamore butts teashirt and running around town for diffrent things through the whole show, the mother was boring and Seamor Butts constantly plugging his company! he had avertized through the whole movie, like when he went to a high school reuion and told everybody that he was seamore butts. I bought the second season without watching the first, big mistake!. A BIG 2 THUMBS DOWN!"
2,Love the design.....very disappointed with the quality,I bought what I thought was an adult's medium........it fits my 5 yr old. Very disappointing!!!! But he has a new shirt now-he's happy.
2,It is a Study Guide but not a very Helpful One,"I bought a few police study guides and found Douglas' guide out of all the others to be less than helpful. The reason being is because the questions are so dumbed down the answers are obvious to choose from. It simply was just not challenging enough i.e. the spelling words were so ridiculously purposely misspelled and the book taught more about grammar than actually teaching you the techniques on how to take the exam. If you are looking for a good grammar and reading study guide this is it, but if you want to work on how to actually learn to take the police exams this book is the wrong study material."
2,Early television with Ramar of the Jungle,"Ramar of the jungle was early kid television but maybe not at it's best? Lots of running in the quote ""jungle"" and things like that! Ramar appeared to be the Tarzan without the vines to swing from??"
5,Bring it On! is an awesome manhwa!,"I recommend this to anyone that enjoys girly mangas or manhwas! Romance, humor, and fights are blended together for a wonderful story. I laughed non-stop while reading! If you want a well-drawn and written story, pick this up!"
5,One of the best books I've found on aromatherapy,"When I started researching natural treatments for arthritis and other ailments to incorporate into my massages, I looked at many a book on aromatherapy, ranging in price from $10 to $79. This book is complete and concise - I checked Julia's info on many different oils against other books written by doctors, scientists, etc. costing much more. All was very accurate, and this book even has pictures, traditional folk medicine uses, etc. If you're into aromatherapy, you need this book!"
4,Great information for the novice and the expierenced !,"This is a great book for both beginners and the expierienced Aromatherapist with detailed information of herbs and Essential Oils, along with a bit of History, detailed discussions of many (?) essential oils, classified by botanical family. Beautifully Illustrated botanicals for the browser and the serious. Gives insight into Massage,recipes and formulas for beauty,cleansing, and healing. Also formulas for disorders of the physical,emotional,spirtual and whole body.Along with precise methods of use. Concise details of each plant and its origin and properties. A good overall book for everyone interseted in Aromatherapy."
5,Great book,"Great product, fast shipment, reasonable price. The content of this book was informative and helpful. Great doing business with you. Thanks."
3,too general,Gives uses for many plants and the essential oils but no complete details for making the remedies with the oils. Eg. how much of each oil to put into the natural remedies?
3,An outline history of the Cold War.,"This is an average read of the very difficult subject of the Cold War. Roberts gives the reader an adequate summary of this difficult time period.Roberts breaks the Cold War into four stages. They are:The European Dimension 1945-1950Korea to Vietnam 1950-1975The Quest for Superpower Understanding 1953-1974Resurgence to Ending 1973-1991.These periods were overlapping. Roberts explains them adequately. Roberts terms some stages of the Cold War as the long peace since the superpowers tried to resolve conflicts with each other. Towards the end, tensions rose as both superpowers tried to exert more power in different areas of the globe.The reader will get a summary knowledge of the Cold War. The writing is academic but the book is short."
1,WAKE UP & BE CAUTIOUS!,"How do the readers know that all the publicity and articles for the products featured are not paid for by the manufacturers of those products? They don't.And do you think that all the plastic surgery physicians were listed in the back of the magazine free of charge? Uh,likely not. Those physicians PAID TO BE LISTED IN THIS BOOK. They weren't listed due to their credentials.To me, this looks like 200+pg. book full of advertisements paid for by the manufacturers to make their products look good. There is NO credible back up that supports the integrity/quality of the products.Does anyone notice that it isn't loaded with ad's? Hmmm, how does a magazine make money without paid advertisements? They don't (subscriptions & consumer purchases don't provide enough revenue).Looks like a cheap knock off of a ""Consumer Reports"" catalog except New Beauty appears ""bought & paid for"".I say ""buyer beware""."
4,nice sandals,Comfy low heel sandals. The straps are easy to slip it and the lightweightness makes it ok to use for walking the entire day but the downside is the stiffness.
1,"what can i say, it says micheal vick on it","i actually only bought this for my pittbull to wear for Halloween, she enjoyed it, it scared all of her pittbull friends lol"
5,Natural Prayer/Natural Way,"This books title speaks for itself. How do we Walk this Natural Way?? Listen to the Heart, it speaks the Truth, then gives us the courage to Walk this Natural Way. Many have gone before and many will come after, the time is now for we who are here!! Mitakuye Oyasin!! We are all related!! We are related to all things!!"
5,VERY EASY TO READ/COMPREHEND,"I HAVE READ ALL OF MCGAA'S BOOKS. HE TALKS -TO-YOU NOT -AT- YOU. MAKES IT EASY TO UNDERSTAND FOR THOSE YOU HAVE LITTLE OR NO AMERICAN INDIAN CONTACT. A ""CANNOT PUT DOWN"" BOOK, AS ARE HIS OTHER BOOKS. I AM HAPPY TO HAVE ALL OF HIS WORKS IN MY PERSONAL LIBRARY."
5,Rainbow Tribe: Ordinary People Journeying on the Red Road,This book pulls no punches about developing a successful and spiritual life. The is serious stuff.
1,More new-age trash,"Ed McGaa is yet another of the growing band of wannabes and charlatans trying to cash in on new-age fascination with Native belief systems. If it didn't make me laugh so hard, I would have torn this book apart after about five pages. Avoid this book like the plague. Or buy it and help finance more exploitation of traditional culture. Trash. I wish I could give this thing zero stars."
4,Love it,My daughter loves playing her Ariel guitar. The strap is a little too long and cannot be adjusted. We just tied a knot in it. The headset works only if you are singing right into it. My 3 yr old loves it anyways and carries it everywhere.
4,Nice choice,My 5 year old loves this guitar. The added feature of disney songs are fun and the lights give the guitar a flair. We haven't quite figured out all the features yet. The microphone is kind of weighty so it must be secured in the hair with the comb feature attached.
4,Great book - highly recommended,"I bought this book as a novice gambler to get a better explanation of casino games and some strategies. The book is great! Gollehon discusses the major casino games by first explaining how the game is played and what actions the player needs to take. Then he discusses the proper strategies to use and the right bets to make. He also tells you what bets not to make.I especially liked the sections on blackjack, roulette and craps. Easy to read and understand, nice diagrams, and nice discussions on strategy. The only downside to the book was that I wished the section on video poker were more in depth and detailed. He refers you to another text in this case.Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone going to a casino."
2,No power = Low Volume,"These speakers are like oversized headphones. They're not battery-powered, so they simply can't output much volume."
3,a very full-bodied intricate story of high fantasy,"Everything centers around this innocent young boy,tring to identify his own worth to a greater cause in which the destiny of everyone rests on his help along with his new friends the immortals,and together they shape anew all the desmesne:the rulers of a very high court all about his world."
2,Off Magazine Street,"I saw the movie ""A Love Song For Bobby Long"" & as it was based on this novel bought the book, thinking that like most movies made the book would be much better. I was wrong on this one. The movie was actually a better story in my opinion."
3,"Interesting, but far from great",This is a book for those who watched the movie A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG. It is interesting to see from where the director of the movie got the whole idea for the screenplay.
1,Wait a while...,"...because if you recall, the FULL 2004 WS set came out AFTER the ring ceremony, which took place at Fenway Park in April 2005. The ring ceremony was on that set.I bet that MLB puts out a more complete set after the ring ceremony in 2008. They seem to be putting this one out now, quickly, to sell DVDs before Christmas. Be patient, hold off, and perhaps we'll see a superior set later on.So I'll be holding off in the hope of seeing this. I waited long enough to see the Sox win the WS the first time in 2004...I can wait for a better 2007 WS box set!"
2,Meh ... I'll pass,"A ""complete"" series? If it's missing the first four games of the ALCS, how is this a ""complete"" series?As others have said, MLB once again pulls a bone-headed move.I'll wait to get it on sale or on eBay ... no way I'm paying full price for an incomplete set of game DVDs."
3,Good series.........but not worth buying,The 2007 Red Sox was a great season and Sox advanced to the ALCS and was down 3-1 and made a good comeback like the Yankees series intense games as well as you watch all 7 games you feel like your there. And swept the Colorado Rockies 4-0 here's the downside of the DVD set. It doesn't have ALL 7 GAMES of the ALCS only games 5-6-7. Why would MLB not put all 7 games on DVD? And the World Series has all 4 games so this isn't worth buying get the classic 2004 World Series has ALL 7 games of the ALCS + 4 games in World Series.
3,"No widescreen, no sale","The biggest disappointment in the 2004 season and now the 2007 season is the lack of a widescreen edition of these DVD sets. I'm a huge fan, but I cannot bring myself to buy these DVDs until there's an HD version or an SD widescreen version. The format is available as Fox broadcast the WS and ALCS games in 2004 in HD and TBS/TNT/Fox broadcast all the 2007 games in HD.I'll give it 5 stars for the content and take off 2 for the format.Edit: Apparently these are in widescreen contrary to the specs at the time of my post. The specs listed on Amazon and everywhere else that I could find at the time said either 4:3 or 1.33:1 which is not widescreen. Sorry!"
5,"Difficult Subject, Wonderful Book","As someone who has fostered a severely brain-damaged child, and who has spent a year working in a classroom for the severely and profoundly handicapped, I appreciated Cindy's candor as well as her viewpoint in writing about this sensitive subject. She consistently emphasizes what many people don't see about caring for these little angels -- that being required to give deeply of ourselves is a blessing. The book is written with tenderness and a mother's love, and also with humor and hope, and is a good read (though it's necessary to keep a box of tissues handy)."
1,Didn't work!,"Bought it, installed it, encountered an error and had to close each time I tried to open it. Uninstalled it and tried again, same result. I do have Windows XP SP2 so maybe that is the problem. I thought they were minimum system requirements on the box, so maybe this is my fault. Shame I was looking forward to using it."
2,Not worth it,I bought this thinking it was a 3D Home Architect Home Design program. It's not. The program is difficult to use and unintuitive.
5,Excellent tape measure,"This is my favorite tape measure...it fits my hand well, the rubber case protects it from damage, the round case is easier to hold than the larger square ones. The magnets are super strong--if you work with metal like I do this thing is fantastic. The tape is easy to read and retracts better than my other tapes. The tape lock doesn't work well but I can put up with a little inconvenience."
4,All Cats Have Aspergers Syndrome,Really cute book for anyone that knows someone with Aspergers and also loves cats!
4,A Wonderful Book for All Ages...,"Having a son with Asperger's Syndrome, I am always looking for books that will help bridge the gap of understanding between his brother and himself... this book did just that. Both adore cats and the simple text was gentle yet informative. And while I may have rephrased some of the text whilst reading, overall, it is certainly a book worth having and one I quickly recommend with a smile."
2,Would have been better -without the cats,I bought it for use with a classroom and found it hard to explain the connection- between cats and aspergers. A book that presented facts- without the cats- would have suited this purpose better. That being said it has good information and works well for adults who do not know alot about Aspergers.
5,Changed Our Lives,"We discovered a few years so ago that my husband has Aspergers' Syndrome, due to the keen observation of a friend who forwarded an article in the New Yorker about a man with Aspergers'. After reading that and getting a few more books online from Amazon.com, I really didn't need a formal diagnosis. My husband would never ""buy-in"" to the clinical research books on the subject, however this book changed everything. It is so thorough and sensitive about describing what it's like through the use of photographs of fluffy kittens and beautiful sentiments, that by the time my husband got to the last page, he had crocodile tears making their way down his cheeks. I asked, ""Do you think you have it?"" ""Yeah,"" he said. This book got his attention and gave him comfort. We've purchases several copies to give to family and friends as a gentle introduction to the syndrome. I love this book."
5,Accurate information and incredibly cute!,"As a fellow author with autism as the focus, I was invited to do a reading of children's books at an autism awareness event in a bookstore. This book captured the attention of adults and children alike in my audience. Other book store customers wandered over to see what was going on. I enjoyed this so much that I purchased a copy for myself.I'm the mom of an adult on the autism spectrum and 3 cats let us live in their house. So I can assure you the cat photos are adorable and the accompanying text is spot on. All Cats Have Asperger Syndrome provides an entertaining, concise explanation of how unique these individuals are. Most of what is said can be applied to others on the Autism Spectrum as well."
1,Hurt my Asperger son's feelings....,"I was excited ordering this book for my son since he is such an animal lover. He does have a very soft heart, which is probably why this book was NOT a good choice for him. My son is exactly for the most part like all the descriptions in the book, however I do not suggest you give it to the aspie child. I think it's more for other children to see to help explain your child. My son ended up balling his eyes out and it took him awhile to calm down after reading this book. Asking him why he's so upset it is to help him he yells because it's true!!! :( I suppose it was not good to remind him he does not have friends, or is different.The book is cute, and I think again it could be positive explaining Aspergers to your child's peers. But I regret buying it for my son."
5,Excellent visual tool!,"This book is a great way for an Asperger's child to feel more normal.(Whatever the child thinks is normal. And it is important to them).Each statement about an aspect of Asperger's has visual of a cat showingwhat that thought looks like for a cat, or maybe even the child.I think all school districts should have this an a mandatory reading.Once Asperger's is better understood, what a good life we all couldbegin to experience."
3,"Cute, but not the original","Although cute, this book takes a back seat to the original, titled: ""My Kitty Catsberger,"" and published in January of 2006 through the Asperger Syndrome Institute. The latter, written by Dr. John M. Ortiz, the director and founder of the A.S.I. [...........] and illustrated by Don McGrath (Disney, Saturday Night Live) is a delightful, imaginative and empowering book sure to delight ""children"" of all ages. Unlike ""Cats,"" ""My Kitty Catsberger"" succeeds in educating while entertaining by illustrating how Aspies are as endearing as their quirky feline counterparts."
4,All cats have Asperger,"The book came in very good condition , like new .At is an easy way to learn basic things about Asperger Syndrome .There are wonderful pictures of cats ."
3,Cute Book,This book was recommended by a psychologist for my thirteen yearold son. I was a bit dubious when I looked at a couple of previewpages but decided to go ahead and buy it anyway. No doubt it isappealing visually and it is an inciteful book it is not suitable for anolder child. They may take it that they are being treated like a fiveyear old when many children with asperger's would prefer to have the factslaid before them.
1,Inaccurate,"I was ready to purchase this book for my son, however after viewing the preview I opted not to purchase the book because one page says that AS kids like to be near those they love but not touched by them. However, MANY, including my son, AS kids have Sensory Integration Disorder issues which make them crave EXTRA sensory input including but not limited to actions like hugging. This behavior may change as the children mature but such a blanket statement is disturbing, particularly since AS kids are very literal and if I gave this book to my son he would then infer that he does NOT have AS."
3,For those supporting AS children,"My grandson was shown this book by his parents on the advice of teachers. After they read through it with him (he was 8 at the time) they asked him did he have any questions..... he looked at them seriously and said ""Mum.....Dad..... I'm not a cat!"" We laughed about it, but with his literal approach to his situation and life in general it confused him. And considering his father is a vet I guess my grandson was amazed at the suggestion he had picked up that he was, indeed, a cat.A good book for adults to understand, but perhaps not as good for the AS child to try and understand their situation. Ultimately it was his father's explanation that all people's brains are wired and that his brain is wired a little differently which makes him very good at some things others are not and vice versa. He now just sees himself as 'differently wired' - and not to be mistaken for a cat!"
5,A sweet book very appropriate for children and people new to their understanding of AS,"My library contains dozens of books on AS. I have read them all. I wish I could get others to do the same, but time being what it is and life being as complex as ever, this is simply an impossible wish. I highly recommend this book as *the* book to present to people with little time but much need to learn about AS. It is also a great book to present to children; those on the spectrum and those in the neurotypical population who would all benefit from understanding their peers with AS and other ASD/PDD related issues.This book is cute and sweet. It is not top-shelf research. It is gentle and gracious. A perfect coffee table book to garnish interest and start discussions. I loved it."
5,Accurate description of Asperger Syndrome,"This book really describes my personal experience with Aspergers Syndrome. Since it is written at a child's level, it may help children who have Aspergers and their friends come to a more tolerant understanding of it. I am going to lend it to some adults I know, maybe they will be more understanding.Also on top of all this, the photographs of the cats are quite beautiful. They selected some of the prettiest cats I have ever seen for subjects. Recommended for cat lovers also."
4,Cute,"Great coffee table book. I wish pediatric neurologists would include this in their waiting rooms, rather than all the ADHD propaganda. It would also be a nice addition to to a elementary school / classroom library. There aren't a lot of words but it is charming nonetheless."
5,Excellent Book,This book is a must have for anyone who has Asperger Syndrome or anyone who knows someone who struggles with it every day. It explains how it feels in simple language and pictures so that anyone can understand.
5,great introduction to the topic of Asperger,"This was the book I had on hand when I talked to my 14yo daughter about her newly diagnosed Asperger syndrome. It made what could have been a much harder moment lighter. It seems overly simplistic at first, but the sweet cat images combined with the sparse text turn out to be very comforting. Highly recommended!"
3,Simplistic info on autism,"Other reviews told it well - that this was very simplistic and the pictures of the cats were cute. Yes, I agree. I mainly bought it to read to kids and show pictures of cats and ""teach"" a little about how we are all different and unique. It is a good starter but the adult needs to go ahead and read, read, read about autism and other related disorders."
3,Entertaining and cute,No detailed explanations or practical information here; just a very fun book that compares Aspergers to the life of cats with beautiful cat photos. My only gripe is the page that says we are all a little bit Asperger. I can see its potential for helping siblings and definately a great book for teachers to use to explain a particular student's disability.
4,Comfort and fun,"I normally dispise cutesy books like this and I am not really a cat person. But I saw this and started flipping through it, nodding my head-almost crying. It's such a well-written, simple book that is very heartwarming, charming, and funny. It makes finding more things to love about my son so much more fun! I've given this book as a gift to several family members to explain AS to them in a way that reminds them that there are wonderful things about my son, many of them can even be attributed to his AS. It's very positive. I also recommend this one to teachers of inclusion classes who will have a child with an ASD in their classroom, to help them and their students know what to expect in their new classmate.Please note, this is not (nor should it be) an in-depth, scholarly work on AS."
5,For My 13 yr old w/ Aspergers,"I wish we had found this book when he was younger! However, even at 13 he was able to instantly relate to this book which is mostly in pictures. FINALLY he understands that he is not alone:)"
5,on LVD,I bought this set as a two hour Laser Disk but it didn't have the Pacific Frontiers material included. We loved it and to avoid LD obsolescence copied onto Two VHS tapes. Now with my DVD recorder connected directly to my LD I can copy to DVD directly with much better quality. It will always be a great piece in our DVD library.
2,LAUGH OUT LOUD HILARIOUS!!!,"This is, hands down, the silliest shovelfull of you-know-what I have ever read. The only thing more ridiculous is the review warning people not to read the book because bad luck will befall you!It is fun to read as fiction--pretty well written, but do not accept what you read as the truth. There are no demons flying around mashing chocolate cakes into cabinetry, lounging in lawn chairs, knocking on doors, or attacking people. Read this with a very large grain of salt."
5,Unique and poignant qualites make this one stand out,"Throughout the course of his extremely successful career, Horatio Alger rarely deviated from his traditional framework for his stories - until this one. Adrift In New York tells the story of a girl, struggling against the offer of a bigamous marriage and subsequently cast out by her guardian, and a boy, who discovers for the first time in his life that there is more to life than stealing and dishonesty. It is a wonderfully moral, yet at the same time superbly entertaining story, and one worth paying any amount to read."
3,this thing is huge,my wife ordered 3 as gifts. She's happy with them. These things are large compared to the normal mate gourds. It's a good product but pricey for the value you're getting.
5,Fabulous New Independent Artist,"Jan Spillane is both prolific and contemporary. Her style of music would appeal to lovers of rock, country, jazz and christian music. I particularly like her fresh approach to song writing and it brightens my day when I listen to this CD. I have seen her perform in Savannah, GA. many times and always enjoy her spirited performances. I would highly recommend her music, in particular this CD, as it is well written, performed and produced. Congratulations Jan...on another great collection. Her CDs always add an element of surprise...I can't wait to see what she does next!!!!"
5,BEST SPANISH CD FOR KIDS,"Jose Luis Orozco has amazing children's music! My little sister used to listen to this. His books are just BRILLIANT as are his cd's. My husband and I constantly are singing along as is my 3 year old, and he has been since 18 months old! Truly one of thee best kids' cd's out there. Jose Luis is a brilliant man, UC BERKELEY graduate, and truly carries on the traditions of folk art. Great to know this exists for my child! Makes a terrific gift! this is just ONE of many of his cd's we own!"
3,Fine but not Great,"I have some of the other CDs and books by Jose-Luis Orozco but this was not exactly waht I expected. In the other CDs the name of the 'song' is said at the begining and it is not done so in this CD, I also did not find the book that accompanies the CD like I did for the other ones. The item is good and if you are fluent and have already been exposed to all of songs but I would have preferred the book to help me out."
2,Good for Spanish Speakers,"I was looking for fun songs my 7 year old could learn to sing. He is taking a Spanish enrichment class one day a week. The songs were not easy for him to understand. Also, the tape is mostly in Spanish with no translation. A booklet would have been helpful."
4,Works As Advertised,"A quiet fast unit (particularly fast with esata card installed, a little slower with USB interface on laptop). The included Retrospect software functions well (although its interface is not overly intuitive). I'd give the hard drive a 5 but the included software a 4 which leaves it at around a 4.5. I highly recommend the purchase to others (and already did so for my department at work)."
2,A sad conclusion to an otherwise brilliant career.,"Albert Ayler's 1969 recording Music is the Healing Force of the Universe was to be his last. Recorded just before his mysterious death, Music ... is also unfortunately one of his most misguided albums. Ayler had fallen on bad times and was under the influence of his eccentric wife ""Mary Maria"". Her ""cosmic vibration"" vocals dominate the album, while Ayler and his rhythm section attempt to back up her pleading declarations. The two longest cuts on the album are the only non-vocal performances, but alas they are both untypical of his better output. ""Masonic Inborn"" is twelve minutes of overdubbed dual bagpipes drug along by a calamitous rhythm section. Oddly, the album closes with an electric blues, featuring a member of Canned Heat. Here, Ayler's blues shouts and growls are nowhere near as intense and revolutionary as his previous recorded legacy made implicit. An odd curiosity, this is one for completists only."
2,Not impressed,"As a former supervisor, manager, program manager, executive assistant, etc., I was not overly impressed with this book. For instance, I only extracted two quotes from it for my collection: ""Employees want most to feel good about themselves and what they do. An effective manager enhances both"" & (quoting Spencer Tracy) ""Take your work very seriously, and yourself not at all."" That's not many from a 392 page book. Mostly it's just common sense or irrelevant IMHO. Not recommended."
4,A fasinating subject,This is another one of those white books from O'Reilly about UNIX. I can't seem to get anywhere with it. Does explain command line UNIX and UNIX architecture. I guess there are so many areas one can be a guru in that not all of us have the time to be UNIX gurus. From what I hear too the work environment at computer corporations is very alientating for UNIX gurus.
3,Freestyle DVD,"When I saw this DVD was coming out....I thought finally I can SEE and listen to the artist I never get to see perform at concerts. I like the DVD over all, but was disappointed at the fact that the never show the artist/group videos in its entirety and that they did NOT show or discuss all the videos by the artist/group that was done. For example, thou I love Angel Clivilles from Cover Girls there where other songs by the group after she was gone and vidoes....where were they or why wasn't it mentioned?!?! NOT a complete documentry if you ask me. I am a die hard fan and hope the next dvd volume(s) show all the vidoes by the artist/group in it's entirety, not over lapped with interviews. But I do recommand buying it and adding it to your colllection. PEACE"
2,"WAIT, WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU WANT WITH THAT ?","IF YOU ARE EXPECTING FREESTYLE MUSIC VIDEOS, YOU`D BETTER FORGET IT.JUST BORING TALKING; BLA BLA BLA!!"
3,Useful but a little boring,"This is useful but a little boring. I think there are better resources out there for figuring out lesson plans and routines for horses. This was OK, I used some of the drills."
4,Western Practice Book,This book was very informative and gives me the proper mindset to bring to the barn for my horse to learn one step at a time. A great reference book and guide.
3,Western Practice Lessons,"This book has a lot of great ideas to take your horse from good to better. Sadly though I did not find the book very beginner friendly, but if you have been ridding for a while and have a horse with a solid start this book has some great exercise to move up."
3,Lacking in key areas,"This book could easily have garnered a 5 star review if it didn't skimp in some key areas:1) I would have liked to see more details, tips, tricks and illustrations on layout. Such an important subject probably deserves a dedicated chapter.2) I would have liked to see more details on common substrates. I understand the author likes to use ditra and its companion products but 90% of us doing projects at home are going to be limited to stuff that you get at the local tile store or hardware store (like backer board). Any complete reference should cover all of the options and methods in detail, not just the authors current favorites."
2,too many typos,"THESE REMARKS APPLY TO THE 1996 EDITION.This book looked like a nice compendium of upper level undergraduate physics. Unfortunately, serious reoccurring misprints early on (starting on the second page, page 13, of the treatment of mechanics - lots of phi's missing lots of dots) have dissuaded me from using the book further. Browsing further (see for example page 35) reveals typsetting errors. I can't have confidence in this text.I hope these errors have been taken care of in the second edition."
5,"Great Stuff, Finally someone does a DVD of old footage right!!","Watched this 2-3 times already. This is a great DVD with quality. 20 matches and stars in everyone. I was told this is the first in a series of several to come. Best of Southwest is next. VCI did a great cover, and the design is top notch. Ox Baker on the cover is the 1970's. It's also nice to see a legal copy of top quality wrestling, unlike ""I Offer "" and ""Ebay"" who allow anyone to sell copies of these fine matches. If you love old wrestling purchase this DVD. For one reason only, its Great!!! and support the cause as well. Soupy"
3,70's wrestling at a decent price,"A cool collection with some of the best but in most cases fighting with second rate competition. To me it was worth what I paid and it's from the days of real wrestling before it admitted it was just entertainment. I have better wrestling DVD's but it belongs in anyones collection who appreciate that time in wrestling history.""The Knuckler"""
1,very disappointing,"I've been a wrestling fan since i was 8 years old and have collected a good many of the videos. With the names listed on the details (Ox Baker, Dick The Bruiser, Mil Mascaras to name a few) I thought this would be a really good buy. Just the opposite. This is nothing but a bunch of second rate TV matches of big stars against studio nobodies with bad video quality. Not worth a dime."
4,Blood Princess of the Vampires...,"Continued reading last of trilogy was good! Liked the way Txema and baby developed. Enjoyed the animal vampires. Should have had more sexual situations with her gentleman, instead of jumping from wanting to actual sex."
2,"Holds well, only problem is it is a bit thick for the door to close","Pro: The hook holds well and it blends in to the white doorcon: only a big one, i cannot close my door now since the material is too thick for the door to close. Metal hook won't have this problem."
3,"Doesn't quite fit, but that's ok","It is very hard to close my closet door with this, but my door wouldn't stay closed before so it's ok."
1,Hook to thick to place on back of door.,I originally purchased this to hang on the back of a pantry door. The hook is so thick that the door would not shut. Oh well I thought... I guess I could use it in a closet. I could not find a door in my house that would close with the hook attached.
2,It's okay,"In the picture, this dress looks thicker than it is. Upon receiving the item, it is made out of nylon material, like an offbrand quality of a pair of pantyhose. It is not the best craftsmanship (it feels like it was made on the bias so feels ""twisted"" when it is on). Also, one needs to be careful, because it will ""run"" if you catch a nail, just like pantyhose. Other than that, not bad."
4,Peek a Boo,Loved the fit. Loved the look. Loved the reaction it got from the husband. Enough said!! Dress came quickly and after figured out where the arms and boobs went it was all good from there! I have really big boobs so I wore a cupless bra underneath it which held the girls up...the dress is fantastic.
1,Unhappy,"This was supposed to be a sexy outfit for my husband for Valentine's day. I should have just cut holes in some of my own pantyhose. Really this is just one leg of pantyhose that has 4 holes cut out for arms and busts. Do not rely on the photo. The pantyhose that it was made from may have been queen sized, but it was only one leg worth for your whole body. Horrible."
3,Do not expect the usual,"After reading Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes and Stotan!, I was hooked on Chris Crutcher. Absolutley, permanently hooked on anything and everything this genius had. I got The Crazy Horse Electric Game, expecting something akin to the books mentioned above, and I was sorely disappointed.First of all, it was written in the third person, but it was present tense, so that was odd. Secondly, it took almost half the book for me to drum up a large amount of interest in this book. Thirdly, it just wasn't very good.If you're a diehard Chris Crutcher fan, read this for posterity. And heck, it does get interesting eventually. But if you've never read anything by him before, then get Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes. It is a much better read."
2,Somewhat tedious,"After reading Staying Fat For Sarah Byrnes and Stotan!, I was hooked on Chris Crutcher. Absolutley, permanently hooked on anything and everything this genius had.

3,The Crazy Game of Life,"A review by NateWilly a hometown hero is about to go on the ride of his life. After a water skiing accident he found out that he couldn't play his all time favorite game baseball. He has gimp in his left leg, after months of and months of rehabilitation he can finally walk. First he gets back to school, and then he realizes that the only one thing that is really important to his family is that he plays baseball. So the only real thing that he really wants to do is run away. He runs away to go see his aunt.When he gets to his aunts house his aunt welcomes him with open arms. He tells his story to his aunt, and in return his aunt calls and talks to his dad. Then Willy goes home. And I can't tel the rest because it would give up the best part of the story."
5,"Well written, heart wrenching book, for mature readers","The Crazy Horse Electric Game is one of the best books I've ever read. Willie Weaver is a child prodigy. He is one of the best baseball players his age. However, as predicted, he gets in an accident. A very realistic and moving book about a young crippled boys struggle. You get to know the character very well, and you start to care about what happens to him. Like it's real. I've reread this book frequently, a couple times every year since I read it in 6th grade, and every time, as I get older, I learn a little bit more. It's a real tear-jerker throughout."
1,A Lifetime original movie in book form.,"Cheesy, contrived, predictable, so on and so forth. If you don't like Lifetime original movies or cheesy ""learning life lessons"" tear-jerker stories, read a good book instead."
5,This novel contains many interesting plots within 1 another.,"""The Crazy Horse Electric Game"" is the greatest novel I have ever read! I'm not the kind of person who enjoys to read, but this was a novel that kept me very interested until the end. The name seemed very funny to me at first, but once I started reading the novel, it kept getting better. I really admire the main character, Willie Weaver; he had a very special talent. It was baseball. After, Willie beats the rival team, Crazy Horse Electric, he later gets injured and is crippled for the rest of his life. After that it seems to him as the world is turning against him, so he runs away. He later faces many more dilemas. Please read this novel, you will not regret reading it!"
5,Crutcher Makes A Sellout,"Crutcher is a genius. He wrote a fantastic story about a phenomanol sports kidnamed Willie Weaver who can't be stopped. Except by an accident of course, an accident that leaves Willie little coordination and no sports ability. His family and girlfriend abandon him so he runs away. Finally he finds a new school. He knows this is his last chance in life. This taught me to do your best in any situation and it just might pay off. I liked it because it had good imagery and it really sucked you into Chris Crutchers world of writing."
5,This book has truly made a lasting impact...,"This book has truly made a lasting impact on me. It has been about eight years since I first read it, and I still recall it as one of the best young adult novels that I have ever read. I think it may be one of the best books in general that I have ever read. It is powerful, emotional, and moving-- just like all of Chris Crutcher's books. Definitely a must read!"
5,sweet memmories,"when I listened to this cd it reminded me of my teachers and my mom singing the songs to me when I was a little girl, it brougt a smile on my face, I had to have it for my children. thank you for letting me share some of my childhood with them."
1,Not worth it!,"The Sony Clie T615C, now with the price cut, is a great bargain; however, the designers at Sony didn't put much thought into the cover which doesn't really do much except flop back and forth and get in the way. The carrying case, unfortunately, isn't that much of an improvement. It's basically like the cover that comes with it with a back and a flap that slips onto the back. It's not as convenient as one might hope. In all, I'd say it's not worth it."
2,Correcting a falsehood in the previous review,"Whoever wrote the previous review most likely just wanted to sell their case or something.This line in particular is incorrect:The case attaches to the clie similar to the standard flip cover with the plastic prongs in the back.I just bought the case from one of the ""used"" section. It's new though, and definitely doesn't have any prongs. All it has is the little leather flab, which to me is quite disappointing. If you open the case to use your pda, there will be nothing holding the case to the pda. It'll just flap around even more than the original cover did (which at least had the prongs to hold the case in) and just be another annoying thing to carry while you're trying to use your pda.Anyways, that's a pretty big annoyance for me, but if you don't mind, then it's fine in every other respect."
4,Great phone with multiple uses,"I've had this phone for about two years now and am adding additional handsets because it works so well as a cheap, easy to operate home intercom. It is so nice not having walk all the way upstairs and across the house to get my sons out of their rooms. The internal phonebook works well, as does the answering machine functions and voice clarity is excellent. I haven't had any problems with interference from my wireless router. About the only complaint I have is the speakerphone could use a little increase in volume, it is hard to hear at times during my conference calls. Great phone I'd buy again anytime."
2,Major design flaw,"I've had this phone for about 4 years.This is a great phone when it works, but it's got a major design flaw: the battery charge management. As batteries get older they don't last as long, I understand that; however, with proper charging, NiMH batteries should have a life much greater than what this phone allows. But that isn't the worst part. That honor goes to the low charge alert. You will not get an alert about a low battery until you place or answer a phone call, and then if you're lucky you've got fifteen seconds to swap handsets (you'd be up a creek if you don't have a second handset) before it shuts down.Then when you place the discharged handset back on the charging cradle it will beep every few minutes to let you know it's charging. What genius thought of that??? Reminds me of Homer Simpson's ""Everything's Okay Alarm.""For 90% of my phone calls, a corded unit would be just fine, but nobody seems to make a decent corded phone anymore except for multiline office units. Sigh."
4,Cordless Telephone,Love this item in fact I bought mor phones so I have them all over my house. Great cordless phone with being to add a phone.
5,WONDERFUL PRODUCT!!,I purchased this product mainly because of the appearance and cheap price. Wow! I was amazed when I finally received this product. Excellent product for the price. No regrets with my purchase.
5,Hardtail addicted,"I have more than 15 pairs of these in my closet and am totally addicted. Years ago I wore these on my 2nd date with my NOW husband and he said they were the reason he asked me out again. LOL These shape the female form better than most. The ONE problem I have found is the stitching often is not sturdy around the crotch and I have had to take MOST of mine into get them re-stitched at one time or another. Aside from the that, they last FOREVER even though they DO fade a bit."
4,Enjoyable,"I had a small bout of interest when I began this book, but once I got into it, I couldn't lay it down.The characters were well-defined and the plot was good.This is the first book I've read of Gun Brooke and I look forward to reading more."
5,Gates Idler pulley,"Pulley is much higher quality than original, fit perfectly. Once I figured out that the a/c noise was really the worn out bearings in the old pulley, I ordered this and it arrived quickly. Great product!"
5,Not quite what I expected...,"I had heard that the Xyron is a good sticker making machine for scrap booking so I asked for one for Christmas. I ended up getting two units, the Model 510 and the Model 900. To my surprise I use them both quite frequently and for many different projects around the house, not just scrap booking. They are so easy to use and versatile. My favorite is making personalized labels on the computer and using the Xyron to make them sticky. No need to spend money on label forms or fighting to get them lined up just right. With the the Xyron you print out what you like and cut it to the size you want. So easy!!"
5,Perfect tool to make stickers out of hard to glue items.,"I love this little machine! I also have the Xyron small sticker maker that I use on small objects. The great thing about this size is that you can push through fine, thin detailed items that you've cut out on a cricut or other device, or any delicate item that would be messy to glue down. This is quick, clean and fast and the results are perfect! I wish I had known about this a long time ago, I would have saved some scrapbook pages from some messy glue warping!"
2,Failed gift,"My wife is really into scrapbooking. So I thought I'd get her this as a gift. Total fail. On her first try with it, the material curled up in the machine and gummed up the works. As she tried to un-gum it, the bracket that holds the top roller broke - just the little piece that goes around the roller end. And Xyron does not sell replacement parts. Now the whole machine, along with all the cartridges I got her, are useless. All because they used cheap, brittle plastic in even the most likely places to break.This was frustrating to use, didn't last long, and made an enjoyable activity un-enjoyable. Maybe I should search online for broken units to scavenge replacement parts."
4,Fun to use,Love this; I can't find enough to make into stickers! Only negative is that I find it difficult to reload a previously partially used cartridge without wasting a lot of it. I might be moving up to the full-sized one when I can afford it.
3,"Bought it for me, gave it to my daughter","I was trying to use this machine to make stickers to sell in my Etsy shop. It's to hard to get the stickers lined up just right. But for personal use it works just fine. Just like everything else, the refills are expensive. Haven't tried it for other things like magnets yet."
1,the xyron machine,"I don't like this machine at all. I have tried and tried,it keeps buckling up and I have wasted too much film.It is susposed to be so easy.ha,ha."
3,"Better than some, but still only a 'For Dummies"" guide","There's not a great deal on practical magick in this book, but it's full of info on sabbats (even though they're Northern Hemisphere oriented), the nature of Spirit (although a little Goddess-biased, like most books are), writing ritual and the philosophy and history of Wicca - Diane Smith manages to blend Wicca with science and make sense of the universe using both Wicca and physics. There's even a little discussion about the Big Issues - there's more real-life, living-the-path stuff in this book than in some others. Overall, a good book, but not the be-all-and-end-all."
4,Easy to understand,This is a good book for an over all view of Wicca today. Easy to understand. Think will be a good reference book for me in the future.
4,Not a bad choice,"A good survey of Wiccan practice, the best thing about this book is that it is very clear about how diverse Wiccan practice truly is, often giving a number of different practices or beliefs held by different people, all of whom consider themselves Wiccan. In fact, that's the main thing that makes me prefer this toThe Complete Idiot's Guide to Wicca and Witchcraft--both are fairly inclusive, but this is the one that shows just how much variation there is within this religion. It's also very clear that this book is not only a how-to for the seeker, but also an informative text for the curious.Also nice is the inclusion of some fairly complex concepts (string theory?), and a good deal of theology made simple."
4,Very good introduction into the world of Wicca,I am a fan of all the dummies guides for there well laid out and easy to follow format. They also make good quick reference guides as well. The book WIcca and Witchcraft for dummies provides a good over view of Wicca and the different aspects that make up the belief set. Things like what are the scared days of the year and concepts of the Goddess in all her forms. I believe this book is a good place to start if you are interested dipping your toe into the world of Wicca. It will give you a road map of where to go next for more information and that is the strength of the For Dummies series.
3,Basic and easy to read,For starters it is easy to read but did not inspire me really if the truth be told. Just was not my kind of book. I love the title and this is what drew me to the book in the first instance as I am only studying the craft for 2 years and thought it would be more detailed. Good read.
4,Clear and concise introduction to American Political and Institutional Theory,"The Contours of American Politics proved itself to be a very accessible and clear in terms of guiding the reader through the primary characteristics of American Politics. Taking time to sketch the historical context which continues to frame contemporary American Politics, Roper lucidly outlines the broader political themes and ideals - from the early contested formation of the Union right through to the emergence of the civil rights movement and beyond - which have been so instrumental in shaping the politics of modern America.Personally, should Roper produce a 2nd Ed., then I'd welcome a section or two on the process of political centralization among the two prevailing political ideologies and, perhaps, a section outlining the significance of US-Israeli political relations in contemporary American Political Discourse."
1,About 1 meter shorter than advertized.,"This cable measured 81 inches (just over 2m) not the 9.8 ft (3m) that was stated on Amazon's web page and also on the on the package. It looked like a good quality cable but was not long enough to reach from my STB/DVR to the DVD recorder. Sending it back, I hope Amazon will pay for the return shipping since I think it is their problem."
1,More of a general overview,"This book is more of a general overview of the experiences of several engineers rather than an exact how to book. While interesting, the reader may be dissappointed to find that it is not as practically applicable as the title suggests."
4,Terror Toons is a good old gory good time,I'll warn you that if you hate a really cheessy and gory film do not rent. But if like Killer clowns from outerspace and Bad Taste get this movie. It will crack u up.
3,Like Killer Klowns from Outer Space only campier!,"This movie is beyond any other B movie about cartoon killers you will ever see! When the film starts the Introduction itself is so out there that you just want to watch more. While the plot drags your annoyed mind through more and more holes and creative slayings you begin to kinda like it....I guess. The characters on one hand made me want to watch it the most. The mother and father of the two daughters they leave behind for the weekend are very animated. The mother is a Drag Queen and the Father is the guy from the impitent commercial with the smile.The daughters are clearly porn stars, I mean who would have a name like Lizzie Borden anyways? LOL!"
5,Spine ripping fun,"Dude, When I went to L.A. for the Fangoria horror festival,.. some ape and clown were walking around, I followed them to a small room where i saw this movie on display. I'm a huuuge horror fan, no matter how cheesy a movie can be, theres always something worth watching in it... this movie is no exception. If you thinking of renting or buying this movie, I say go for it. why? Lizzie Borden is hot, for one... dressed in her schoolgirlish charm... but besides that, the main reason to get this is for the scene where little Lizzie's spine, gets ripped out of her back, and she gets used as a puppet. come on now, if you like evil shtuff like that, this movie is worth seeing at LEAST once."
3,dumb but funny,For a horror movie it was a piece of garbage but otherwise it was hilarios! I like really stupid horror movies. I wouldnt own it but rent it for a good laugh! FUNNY!
3,The Best Movie I've Seen Today,"Terror Toons is a creative horror-comedy. It's not scary at all, and it's not too funny either (except for when Candy and Cindy's parents are onscreen), but it's got gore galore. It's about cartoons who pop out of the televison screen and start killing people in some of the grisliest ways imaginable. Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, and Michael Myers don't even do this much damage when they murder people. I'm talkiing decapatations, intestines, and some poor guy even loses his brain. Recommended strictly for gorehounds."
1,another warning,"this film is often brought up in conversation between my friend and I. Not in a joking ""that was a pretty bad movie"" way but in a deathly serious ""was that even a movie?""way. Get a digital camera and have two friends run around in rubber suits... you'll have a film of equal quality to terror toons. They do have SOME animation in here... but it's more like a powerpoint presentation using clip art images. I couldn't sit through the whole thing... I can't see how anyone could..."
3,Kinda Silly!!!,"I have had this movie for about a year, and I finally finished it! It's extremely crazy, and makes you feel like you are tripping on acid! There are melodramatic moments, silly dialogue, a transvestite mother, weird lookin' killers, and much more! When their parents are out of town, Candy and Cindy are home alone. Candy receives a 'Terror Toons' dvd in the mail, so she goes to her room and watches it. Cindy calls some friends to come hang out. Soon, Dr. Carnage and Max Assassin escape from the tv and turn reality into their world. I'd probably recommend TERROR TOONS!!!"
1,THIS IS THE WORST THING EVER.,PLEASE DO NOT BUY OR WATCH THIS AT ALL. IT'S THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING EVER IN THE HISTORY OF EVERYTHING.DO NOT WATCH.
1,THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER,"I love independent film, love it, I can sit through just about anything, even ANKLE BITERS. I'm not even taking budget into account,a good idea and a competant script even worth writing let alone filming are free. This piece of crap had to stop I didn't even finish watching it, thank god I had enough where-with-all to not destoy the disc, thank god I only rented this piece of crap. DO NOT BUY THIS, DON'T RENT THIS, DON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT AT THE VIDEO STORE, DON'T FINISH READING THIS REVIEW, just close your browser and walk anway from your computer and try to forget that you even heard about this movie. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SO-BAD-IT'S-GOOD MOVIES IT'S INSULTING TO HUMANITY.p.s. I gave it one star because amazon makes you give atleast one star"
3,Like Killer Klowns from Outer Space but campier!,"This movie is beyond any other B movie about cartoon killers you will ever see! When the film starts the Introduction itself is so out there that you just want to watch more. While the plot drags your annoyed mind through more and more holes and creative slayings you begin to kinda like it....I guess. The characters on one hand made me want to watch it the most. The mother and father of the two daughters they leave behind for the weekend are very animated. The mother is a Drag Queen and the Father is the guy from the impitent commercial with the smile.The daughters are clearly porn stars, I mean who would have a name like Lizzie Borden anyways? LOL!"
1,Still trying to regain intelligence,"Whoa! What was that movie I just wasted 100 minutes of my life on? I honestly felt drained of all intelligence for several hours after watching this ""movie"". 3 days? It shouldn't have taken more than a shift at work to make that film! The scariest part of the film was when it started and I realized what I had gotten into. Who's bright idea was it to actually put this schlock onto DVD? Did they honestly think that better clarity and sound would help it? Oh well, at least I'vve seen the bottom of the barrel now and I can get on with my life!"
2,Jerry Macaluso bombs again...,"Looks like anything this executive producer involves himself in will result in disappointment, disaster, and a rather pedestrian effort. Caveat emptor!"
2,Untitled,"This movie is kinda like really low budget. So unless you like to watch really low budget flicks, then you can rent this, I don't recommend spending a lot of money buying this type of flick though. Unless you like it much. It was okay. Kinda something fun to watch with people and just to laugh at it. But during most of the flick, I kept hearing comments like ""What is wrong with this movie?!"" You know? Well, it was okay. I was being nice and gave it 2 stars for the effort put into this. It was worth its 2 stars."
1,NEGATIVE 5 stars,"This movie is a total piece of S**T. I rather watch House Of The Dead 20 times in a row than watch this movie again, and you all know how bad House Of The Dead was. Nuff Said. Save your money!"
1,It's been a year and I still feel nauseous!,"My two friends and I watched this movie over one year ago, and it nearly ruined our friendship.This movie leaves you feeling cold and distant, like your entire city being nuked while you were away, and finding everyone you know charred to a crisp.I was asked by another friend one evening at the video store if we should rent it, I told them I would rather set my arms and legs on fire and watch them burn then feed them to my neighbors dog than watch that movie again. He thought I was joking.I even heard that American soldiers forced Iraqi prisoners to watch this film at Abu Ghraib prison, but found that they drew the line at sexual abuse and attack dogs, this movie was too much even for insurgents.Please, do not watch this movie unless you are on the verge of suicide, and need one last good reason to end your own life."
1,Worst movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!,I rented this movie at Blockbuster and I don't understand how they could have this so-called movie as part of their stock. It was sooo bad. Worst movie I have ever seen!!!
4,A useful account of pre-contemporary Marian visitations,A series of 8 essays published in 1960 on Marian apparitions from Guadalupe to Fatima and beyond. The most recent sightings covered are Banneux and Beauraing from the 1930s. If you want some basic background on these earlier visits of Mary and don't mind the official Catholic version this is a very useful book.
4,"Good book, would recommend","La Salette could have been brought out in greater detail, but book was good overall"
5,A Wonderful introduction for children,"Our 5-year-old twins received this book from their grandmother (""Nonna""), and absolutely loved it. The most amazing thing was that about a week later, they were in the grocery store with their mother, and they saw the cover of LIFE magazine. They immediately recognized it as a Giotto fresco, and informed their mother, who had not noticed it. We bought a copy (of course) and had to call Nonna and tell her all about it. I can think of no better way that we could be instilling an appreciation and knowledge of art in our children."
4,A Boy Named Giotto-Gothic artist,I shared this book with my elementary art students and they loved the story and illustrations. I really think that benefited seeing this book in their studies of Gothic art. I only wish that it had contained some of Giotto's actual paintings for them to see at the end. Beautiful book.
5,GREAT BOOK,Easy to read. Good balance of just enough theory and an ample amount of examples and problems to test one's knowledge. Can be used as either a main textbook or as a supplement for self-study. Perfect for those looking to use MATLAB as an integrated study tool.
4,"The Fair Maid of Perth or, St Valentines DAy",I enjoyed reading this book I never knew what the outcome of some circumstances would be. It kept me guessing and I was very surprised at the results of some of the things that happened. I wanted to read this because another book I had read the persons in the story said this was there favorite book so out of curiosity I wanted to read.
5,Motorcycle engine oil and shaft drive gear drive,Bought 2 (one for engine drain plug and one for shaft drive drain plug). Both look good and seem high quality.Bought them as early warning devices for excessive (magnetic) material in the engine/gear box oil and rear drive hypoid fluid on a motorcycle. (Also to reduce amount debris)Would buy again.
3,usable,"These are pretty low sound quality speakers, which is a shame because if they sounded good, it would make the case design a winner. I fully expected them not to be super-quality and was going to wait after seeing them to do a google search and read some reviews, but my shop-aholic addiction got the better of me and I paid $29.99 minus a $2 coupon at a WA sate drugstore chain called Bartell's.I am listening to the 4 disc ""The Cure"" B-sides album via Napster right now, and I am glad to get the sound off the tiny and tin-ny built-in speakers of my low end Toshiba M35X-S161 laptop.You ought to read the horrible reviews from the Ziff magazines etc. if you are considering buying them. However, I saw a low $19.99 price for them on-line without rebates and at that price they might serve your purposes."
2,Probably not worth it.,"I bought this thinking its small portable and can plug into almost anything unlike USB. However, these speakers are really aren't even coming close to giving you the quality you payed for. Even at their cheap price i would have thought the speakers would be better but i have seen remote controled trucks for kids with better speakers than this. The on/off switch didn't work very well either and kept killing my batteries since it wouldn't shut off. I would only get these as a last resort."
4,Great read,"SCRAPS OF LOVE is a sweet anthology guaranteed to be a quick and enjoyable read. It was fun reading how the quilt in this book got its start and how it was handled as it was passed from generation to generation.My favorite story in this anthology is Mother's Old Quilt, but all the stories were very good."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Implementation",I love my 568 and also purchased the pocket keyboard. I give only two stars because the keyboard hides the power and USB connectors. If you install the keyboard you have to run off of battery power and must remove the keyboard to use synchronize or recharge.The manual is bad. You must remove the original cover of the Jornada to install the keyboard. The manual does not tell you how to do this.
2,"leakey, have to pump dispenser too many time to get alcohol to surface","I work in health care and have worked with this product several years ago and loved it. But it belonged to the company I worked for. So I decided to order my own. and this is that exact product that I've used in the past.Unfortunately I am extremely disappointed with it. The product leaks. the dispenser straw inside the container keeps falling off. and sometime you have to push the dispenser lid down about 15 times before you get any alcohol out of it, completely defeating the purpose for the convenience of which it is intended. ( I can open an alcohol packet faster than that) Also, I never had any of these problems with this product when I worked with it in the past. That is the reason I decided to order one for myself. But I am extremely disappointed with this one. I give this product two thumbs down. or on a scale of 1 to 10 about a 3 & 1/2"
3,Minus 8 - Eclectica,"Minus 8's music has taken a turn: leaving behind his earlier drum 'n' bass work, he now trods the well-worn lounge-jazz downtempo path. In keeping with his new label, Stereo Deluxe, he dabbles in the 'internationalist' sound that, even now, is wearing increasingly thin. So it's too his credit that he can still craft interesting tracks for his 5th album, ECLECTICA. ""Capriccio"" takes a snippet from the Tschaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite and turns it into a funky vocal piece, while ""Heaven Knows"" goes for instrumental blissfulness. Both versions of ""Soverto"" have an easygoing tropical flavor, and the over-the-top spoken word disco of ""Go:Disco"" is actually entertaining. But much of the album sounds too familiar: ""Acapulco 60"" is very reminiscent of De-Phazz, and the dub-inflected tracks (""So Fine,"" ""Brave & Bold"") just aren't convincing. And the less said about the pseudo-hip-hop tracks, the better. So while this album is indeed eclectic, it's not particularly consistent."
3,Medicore unfortunately,"Minus 8 does have alot of other 5 star but this one was just straight blah at some points. Basically ALL the dub on here is bad; even Minus 8 can't make me like this horrible genre... I do admit everything else was pretty good though. I guess since I like rap, I was cool with the tracks he had on there. Again,I say that all the tracks are good EXCEPT those 4 dub tracks, which bring this album down 2 stars for me."
4,"""Soverato"" track - great, magic, fabulous, my favorite","""Soverato"" is my favorite track from this album. I enjoy in magic sophisticated sound and voices. Nice! On that album missing more songs like that."
5,Trilla,"Any UGK fan will enjoy this...Lots of interviews w/Pimp & Bun about the creative process for this record & their outlook on the current music scene, some live preformances, clips of em' in the studio jammin the live instruments or puttin down a line. Ugk-4-Life, pick up te new record. ..also has 3 music vids = Game Belongs to Me, Pourin Up, & Draped Up"
1,"A ""clone"" book of ideas and no reference to others","Reading this 'leadership pipeline' I became really astonished of seeing here all the ideas of Elliott Jaques and Gillian Stamp (Bioss International) just copied with no reference to them. I keep wondering how can that be done. Jaques and Gillian Stamp has written for so many years about human capability and seven levels of work complexity that are clearly repeated in this book withouth no comment to them. Even the general themes are there, for example managing other, leader of leader, managing a business unit, managing a group of business unit. If you don't beleive me, just read Requisite Organization (Jaques) and previous ones, for example, and you will learn that Jaques' ideas are being developed for more than 30 years. So, better learn with the real creative people that has really done researches around the theme."
3,Poor leadership can cripple your organization,"The books is thorough if not a bit repetitive. Basically, there are (one too many) stages of leadership, each with it's own unique skill set and value system. When a manager moves up without recognizing the shifts in skills or values needed, misery ensues. This is all very true and it hurts a little to read how things can go wrong at every level.It may be best to keep the book around during your professional life and check in every once in a while to make sure you are leveraging the right skills and valuing the right work. I would recommend this book but since only one section is relevant at a time, I would say buy and keep for the long term or borrow from a friend."
4,A Good Read!,"Organizations need leaders, but natural leaders are at least as rare as natural athletes. And, even natural athletes need careful training and development - given that almost everyone is capable of developing some degree of athletic potential. Similarly, the right training and development program can help almost anyone cultivate some degree of leadership potential. In fact, it can help a few people develop extraordinary leadership abilities. Ignoring leadership development is foolish, but at many companies, short-term priorities eclipse the long-term thinking needed to develop a good leadership pipeline. This book's plain, sensible approach is simple without being simplistic. It is generally lucid and clear, and - somewhat to our surprise - it does not suffer from having three authors. If you are a leader or need to develop leaders for large corporations, this is a very useful volume."
2,Dull,"I enjoyed Kessler's book on the Presidents sooo much more. Maybe I just find the Presidents more interesting subjects, but I thought this book was rather dull and plodding, just a laundry list of problems with the members of Congress. It's based on personal interviews and news reports, which are thankfully all footnoted so we know KESSLER is not making this stuff up, but how honest are his sources?? This book is for those who enjoy the National Enquirer.If you like the Enquirer and can get this book in a cheap paperback, go ahead. Otherwise, don't bother."
4,shocking and to the point,Shocking behavior. Begins with zest andthen turns to PACs and can't get away fromthe money issue.Every Senate officeshould have a copy AND READ IT.
4,Nice camera,"I bought this camera for my son's wedding, and it produced some very nice pictures. Have some extra batteries with you. This one is a nice size for travel when you don't want to take your big camera with you; it won't replace a larger camera with all the bells & whistles, but a nice extra one."
2,Poor image quality,I bought the C663 because I want a smaller camera than my Olympus C-4000 which I've been very happy with. I'm returning the C663 because the images are not sharp. I take test pictures of my dog. With my C-4000 I can blow up an image and see every hair. With the C663 the blown-up image does not show detail. The reviews I've read say the C663 image quality is excellent. I use iPhoto so maybe that makes a difference for some reason. I would like to hear other consumers' experiences with image quality and the C663.
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"Silly, self-aggrandizing trifle. Rowling is so smart, so destined for success, even from birth, blah blah. Must have been made by a sycophant."
5,Mesmerizing Story about Author of The Harry Potter Series!,"I watched this made for TV movie (I think it was made for TV), starring Poppy Montgomery as J. K Rowling. I was mesmerized, start to finish!!! My whole family have been HUGE FANS of the Harry Potter series since the first movie came out! We have read ALL the books, & seen ALL the movies, with the exception of Pt.2 of The Deathly Hallows, which we are going to see this coming Thursday afternoon! My dear grandson, Mitchell, now age 15, can hardly wait for the grand finale!!!J. K. Rowling is a writer who leaves most other writers in the dust!! She is a GENIOUS, pure & simple!!!!! The story of Harry Potter draws in people of ALL ages!!! It is not a children's book, it is an EVERYBODY book!!! God Bless her!!!"
3,"A ""Should Have"" for Stevie B Fans","The audio quality isn't the best. Basically, they show spots of the fans and the stage setup from various concerts, but minimal performance footage. All of Stevie B's videos are on this DVD... Spring Love, Dreamin' of Love, I Wanna Be The One, Pump That Body, Dream About You, and You Are The One. These videos are impossible to find elsewhere, so the DVD is worth having just for those. The main program features bits and pieces of videos, television spots, and various concert footage (as described above) and throughout the program Steve B sits through an interview with Galley describing the scenes. The price is right, so I would recommend this to Stevie B fans."
4,Good product.,Works very nicely on thick wavy hair. I always had the problem with fizziness so this was a great find for me !This makes my hair look shiny and smooth ! No more frizz-ease ! :)
3,Works but is a bit of a hassel.,"I thought this stuff works well enough, but the whole ""use on soaking wet hair"" part just doesn't fit in with my morning schedule. I live in a pretty cold climate which requires me to have dry hair before I walk out the door. But instead of being able to towel dry my hair (or get a goopy towel) I have to sit there and blow dry forever. It adds about 5 minutes to my morning routine. Not worth it with all the more convenient products out there."
5,The best Serum!,"I love this serum! I have used store to salon brands. This one beats them all! I use this product after straighten my hair twice a week. Its very easy to use, massages easily into hair, not oily and my hair feels so soft and light. Wish I found this brand sooner!"
2,Frizz ease pleassssse,No way does this stop frizz well at least not on mine or my daughter's hair. I even used it to blow dry my daughters hair and nothing I tried it on my wet curly hair and I was frizz city as usual. The best I can say is that it's give you shine but I can get that from almost anywhere. So this will be my first and last frizz ease purchase.
1,Didn't do much but made hair look like straw,"The only thing going for this product is that it is inexpensive. Maybe it works well for hair that is slightly fizzy, but for thicker Mediterranean hair, it does nothing to help smooth out. Left my hair looking a little straw-like. Tried it several times with varying amounts, then ended up throwing it out."
3,It's Good,"Good, but...I have frizzy and thick, wavy, hair. So, it makes it behave better, but I cannot use this and expect my hair to behave. I need a whole arsenal of products."
5,Its For Real,"Man, i can't even believe. How well these girls sing together in harmony and with such effect. Its amazing even with the songs being covers. It feels like they've been together forever. They sing these songs with such emotion and feeling all the while having fun doing it. I wish the Young Divas came over to the states and took it on there. I guarantee they would gain an even larger audience then they have ever had.With that being said the whole cd is great and is a solid buy. It will cost a bit more with it being an import but it is still worth it regardless.Tracks of note:What A FeelingThis Time I Know It's For RealGloriaShe Works Hard For The MoneySay I'm Your No.1The other tracks are all on point as well but i really enjoyed the ones above. Thats it have fun!!"
1,Smells bad when opened,"I opened this product and it smelled soooo bad, like fingernail polish remover or some kind of chemical like smell. I got a refund and never took the product and was told it was just the synthetic cotton that they use to pack it is what makes it smell so bad and I was told to keep it open on the counter to air out for about a week. Jeese! that doesn't sound good at all so I'm not going to use this product and they should change their packaging."
4,Walks the Talk,"This title is as big as the author's native Texas. But it walks the walk -- an excellent primer that gently puts us in our place as the global village shrinks. More important, it walks the fine line between a cute three-minute-global management piece and a too-large encyclopedia of do's and don'ts. Very useful. It'll be in my bag on every trip abroad."
5,I'm THE Principal in a Regulated Industry.,I can go on and on and on...But Rules & Regulation (s) are different from everyday encounters of in-differences and office politics. Correspondence is a scary word for us and the customer base too! It is a two dimensional. A Mirror Image of things we face. My Xperience has been that it is usually based on monetary issues or 'that's not what I'm saying and you do not get my point'. Me! I am xtremely difficult to work with. The Principal. The CEO & President. Truth I make Executive Decisions. It means it is FINAL.If you have any further comments: Write to [...] or Department of Consumer Affairs. That is my recommendation.

4,Interesting book.,The concept for the book was intriguing. It kept me interested and wanting to read it. The characters loved their land and were protective of it and the creatures that lived there. But the mother was overly protective about keeping her daughter away from people and the world.
5,Expert weaving of past and present,"As pointed out by others, this novel does deliberately and knowingly by the lead character parallel the story of Scheherezade and her 1001 nights. Ruth Rendell through her character, Liza Beck, has us as entranced as any sultan as the story of Liza's obsessed mother is unfolded. As usual, the author has us prepared for the worst while hoping for as happy a resolution as the circumstances in the story will allow."
1,Waste of time,"I thought I would give Ruth Rendell's book a try, since I did enjoy one by Vine. This one was just not worth it. The story line did not keep me interested at all. I will not be purchasing any more."
3,Into a strange mind and history,"Too many Ruth Rendell books in a row can be a little tiresome: too many dark secrets, too many intelligent and secretive women, tangled mother-daughter relationships until this reader is ready to give up the Rendell habit. ""The Crocodile Bird"" stands out because of its unique narrator, Liza. Liza has spent her entire life isolated from everyone but her mother, and much of the pleasure of this novel is in sharing her discovery of the modern world and her considered opinions on it, rather than simply revealing the past that she shared only with her possessive, obsessive mother. Liza's past and present are slowly unfolded and entwined. Rendell's gift has always been her characters, and her Scheherezade Liza shines."
3,"Ruth provides a ""happy ending"" for once?!","This book reminded me somewhat of Shirley Jackson's classic novel of madness and isolation ""We Have Always Lived In The Castle.""I like pretty much ALL of Rendell's books but I felt this one was a bit ""long"" for no real reason. We knew what the mother was up to so by the end of the book--much of it told in flashback--I was expecting a final encounter between daughter and mother...which doesn't happen.Most of her books I give a 4 or 5 star to (she's THAT good) so you can't go wrong with this...but again, the length didn't seem to add anything to the overall story. And it does have a happy ending...for a Rendell booK!"
3,i skip read it!!!!,"how does she get so many awards????i find her books sooooooooooooooooo on and on about nothing.... some witty stuff here and there but mostly u finish it and think HUH????this book though is better than other two i have read , but still drags and drags... and then??? NOTHING? ok so she can survive..we knew that half way through the book... there's no suspense nothing..."
1,Dull and implausible,"Am I the only one who finds most of Rendell's books dull, silly and implausible? This one was particularly bad. The central idea was laboured and highly unlikely and rammed home to the reader by countless reiterations of the same theme. Dickens, indeed! I've rarely come across such unbelievable characters or such poor dialogue. And how anyone can compare Rendell's writng to that of P.D. James amazes me. Baroness James couldn't write this badly if she tried."
5,From The King To The Boss,"Elvis will always be the King, but this concert video is proof positive that Bruce Springsteen, in his fifties, is still the BOSS! He sings and plays guitar with the intensity and energy of a man half his age. The E-Street band members are supremely talented musicians who sound great. The songs are finely crafted narratives, filled with colorful characters. The biggest surprise occurs when Bruce plays piano on the song ""The Promise."" The biggest disappointment is seeing a snippet of the song ""Blood Brothers"" during the interview segment, but not having a complete performance of that song included elsewhere. However, that's a minor complaint considering how great this concert DVD is."
4,The Boss Rocks,"Few rockers in history demonstrate the energy and stage presence as Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, and this video illustrates it."
4,"Good show,BUT.....","Very good sound and loved the shows format, but can't understand why it was mixed as 5.1 and is light on the .1With a band of this caliber, why hold back a great drummer, and bass player???If this would have had super bass like the rest of the sound, I would have given it 5 stars..........Still a very good DVD."
4,Bruce and the Band: Always Great,"Excellent effort overall. The main set is 3 stars, with some sound problems and a sense of disengagement. The extra material, about 11 tunes, is top notch, not to be missed 5 star stuff. The semi-acoustic ""Born in the USA"" is haunting, and dispells any myth as to what the song is really about. Well worth a purchase. The Boss and the E Street Band in concert are always a treat."
5,Mr Chris,"What a great DVD for any Bruce fan! The clarity and quality of sound puts you right at the concert . You would swear you could reach out and touch Bruce and the ""E"" Streeters .The picture is that crisp and detailed . Can't wait to watch it over and over!"
5,"Thank you, Bruce...","A true DVD concert experience...Disc One (with extras) is the HBO Concert from N.Y.C. Disc Two has more ...the audio is superb ( DD 5.1 or Pcm stereo) The video quality is amazing---America IS the Land of Hope and Dreams. Thank You, Bruce, Patti, Clarence,Mighty Max,Dan, Nils,Gary,Roy and last but not least...Steven"
2,Okay - not what I expected,I have always like Bruce Springsteen but never owned any of his music - after the Super Bowl I decided I needed something so I read the reviews in Amazon and made my choice for the DVD - Bruce has done some good music but you really have to get by alot of the booring same sounding stuff to get to the good songs - Kind of like buying an album with only a couple of good songs on it.
3,Springsteen in New York,"This was a decent concert performance by Bruce, however most of the songs I'd not heard before, and it took Bruce about half the CD to get with the program. Suddenly it was like someone reminded him he was being recorded live, and he jumped to it-- getting crowd involvement, and motivating his band to do more than just go through the motions of yet another concert."
2,Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band???,"Being a Springsteen fan, I waited for the release of this DVD - it was the first Springsteen DVD I purchased. Unfortunately it could have been better. The video could have been arranged better and picture quality is much worst than average. Sound perfomace needs much improvement! Some of the songs did even sound like him - he was so wild that he lost control. The recording needs a cleaner recording and mix, as it's lacks clarity. In my opinon it should be done over - something like greatest hits live; in control; shorter; improved sound (DTS) and video! If possible, I would return it. Please note that I viewed this on a high definition TV and audiophile sound equipment. I'm still a Springsteen fan, but it seems that I'll have to wait for a better performace."
2,OVer the top performance. Annoying,"The Boss exagerated here... trying to showcase his great energy, he sometimes even forgot to sing, and just SHOUTED the whole song.. Annoying..."
1,Bruce did himself no favours ...,"This music DVD has very average video quality, and below average audio. Bruce Springsteen did not do a very good job of producing and performing on this video."
2,Hum-m-m-m-m,"I just can't force myself to become a Springsteen fan. I've really tried, but he comes across as a Bob Seger wanna' be."
4,Energetic! Powerful Stage of Boss!,This is his first TV concert from NYC Medison Square Garden.His performance makes me crazy. But I disappointed cannot hear 'St. of Philadelphia'.Picture quality is very good. This is Anamorphic Widescreen Format. 5.1 sound is nice. But Bonus menu is only just shot interview.
5,"IF You're no fan yet, you will be after this!!","Simply amazing, hours of feeling like you are at this magical concert, this is what music is all about...!!"
3,somewhat disappointing,I Expected a higher quality DVD. Video was ok but sound quality was disappointing. I was hoping for better song selection and should have explored before I purchased. Was only $10 so I can't be too critical.
3,Only buy if you are a big Bruce fan,"I was hoping to hear many of Bruce's covers and pop tunes. I quickly realized this DVD is for die hard Bruce fans. Many of the songs I have never heard before and they were boring to me. It seemed to me that big Bruce was at many points coaxing the crowd to get more into it but the problem was too many ballads not enough rockin. I couldn't even watch the whole thing it was so long and boring. I grew up hearing much of his work in the 80's and loved it but many of those tunes were absent or there were so many obscure ballads to wade through to hear one ""good"" song I got tired. I tried skipping to the next song over and over and each time I would get something boring with the occasional hit that I could remember. No disrespect to Bruce or his fans but if you are expecting an exciting concert and hit after hit, this is not for you."
3,Not the REAL!! Bruce,"Side one was Fabulous!!,but side twoexcept for ""The Promise"" was a bigdissapointment. Born in the USA andThunder Road were done in a sleepwalkno moving or life at all. The songs were madepopular the way the original was done,notsome new slow crawling version"
5,Just Incredible,"Over the last several months I have been collecting concert DVDs. I have purchased concerts of Styx, Billy Joel, Rush, Paul McCartney, Third Day, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and others. I enjoy most of them for various reasons, but they are all amateurs compared with Bruce and the E Street Band. The audio is superb and the camera coverage is excellent. I highly recomend this DVD. If you're not a Springsteen fan, you will be after seeing this one...."
3,"Great live performer, decent DVD","I saw Bruce at Madison Square Garden the week this DVD was filmed, and its sad to say this DVD doesn't come close to the live show. The biggest shortcoming is that they did not film one concert, or even several songs all the way through. They show 'Born to Run' and then fade to black and then fade to another song, which was clearly not the next song played during the actually concert. This really takes away from the feeling that you are there watching him. The quality of music is amazing, and Bruce live is simply the best. Unfortunately this DVD does not capture that. I hope he releases a most continuous show from his 2003 'The Rising' tour, where he was twice as good as he was on this 2001 tour."
5,The boss is the Boss and the Boss is Springsteen,"I have never had the opportunity of seeing Springsteen & E Street Band directly on stage. So, when I saw ""Live in New York City"" I was impressed a lot. It was a wonderful experience to see Nils Lofgren playing the guitar on ""Youngstown"", Little Steven singing on ""Two Hearts"", Clarence Clemons playing the sax on ""The River"" and ""Jungleland"", Roy Bittan playin the piano on ""Jungleland"", Patti Scialfa singing ""Romble Doll"" and ""Mansion on the Hill"", Danny Federicci playing the acordeon on ""Mansion on the Hill"", Gary Tallent and Max Weinberg giving the power in every song, all they are a super rock and roll band, but Springsteen on ""Tenth Avenue.."", ""41 Shots"", ""The Promise"" and ""Ligth of Day"" simply shock me...I only have a doubt: When will Bruce & Co. come to México???"
4,Exactly what I wanted,"I had been looking for a pocket hole jig for some time, but most were much more than I wanted to spend. This little jig may be one of the best tools currently in my shop. Perfect price point, takes up little space and easy to use.Do yourself a favor and watch the kreg videos on how it works; the videos will help explain where you should line up the jig and how to clamp it."
5,Good Value for the money,Hubby wanted to start experimenting with pocket joints and this was the best price and highest quality jig on the market. The price here was much better than other online or local hardware stores. He's very happy with his jig and I'm very happy with the price.
1,face frame jig,"An expensive waste of time. Requires special (and expensive) drill bit and screws to work well. Any competent woodworker should be able to duplicate function with a regular electric drill / screw gun, glue and screws."
1,Bait and Switch,"Watching this movie reminded me of the great line from the Tom Hanks movie ""Bachelor Party"": 'Normally, I don't like my filth this clean.' There is only one reason to watch a Shannon Tweed movie and it isn't here. Normally, I wouldn't complain--you pay your money and take your chances. But this movie is a flat out violation of truth in advertising. It's billed as a R rated movie on amazon, on the cover for the disk, and even stamped on the dvd itself. But as soon as you play it you're told that it is PG. And, boy, does it ever deserve it's PG rating. I've seen more skin in documentaries on the Amish. If you're one of those rare birds who'd watch a Tweed movie for the plot, forget it--it's not good enough to keep an insomniac awake nor is it bad enough for camp. If you need a movie to get rid of unwanted guests, this might do the trick. But, if you want to see Shannon in all or even some of her glory, look elsewhere."
2,"""Damn girl, what happened?""","Hard Vice, an engrossing and sweeping film of Las Vegas nightlife, boasts a stellar cast and fine screenplay, but a poor and convoluted plot. With great lines such as ""Damn girl, what'd ya do in that bathroom?"", this film wastes its immense potential. Shannon Tweed shines in this quasi-hot flick as a homicide detective. Her fine supporting castmates do their best to bring nuance to their scandalously underdeveloped characters, but overall this film is only average. The biggest mistake in this film is wasting the fine potentiality of scenes in the stunning Maxim and Arizona Charlie's Hotels in Vegas. Still, worth watching with your mother or grandparent."
5,Great book. Great authors,"I had a class with Dr. McKim as part of my requirements for my Masters. He is VERY good. I must say, I am little biased here, but I liked him as a lecturer and I bought this book as soon as it came out and I love it. I had never actually used the concept of Design by Contracts anywhere until my class with Dr. McKim. If you are a developer or an architect for any OO based language (Eiffel, c++, java, &#65533;), you read this book and use it as your reference."
1,I think contracts are not very strong tool,"I read this book and I think presented material is not practical in commercial applications. In my opinion better solution is writting tests and using aspects to integrate applications. I know this is something different from contracts, by I think contracts are to complex, hard to maintain and lacks of support for multithreaded problems.For me another problem with contracts is problem in describing complex constraint that exists in problem domain. For example how to describe that objects must be cloned, not passed by reference or how to check that objects holded by readonly list not change their state during operations on list?Regards,Marcin"
5,Strong pair,They're very functional. You can wear them with anything and they're very sturdy. What's best is that they're very dainty.
4,relative cheap and good,"1300mAh is relative good, but not enough. Since the slowly starting of DP1, I choose not closing camera to avoid missing some moments. However, in this case, the battery can't last long. Fortunately, it's relatively cheap, so I bought 3 for my DP1."
5,Principles of quantum mechanics by D. I. Blokhintsev,"This is a great ""old-school"" quantum mechanics book. It has clarity, substance and mathematical depth. The basic theory of quantum mechanics is very well explained."
5,Best Summary of Modern Research,"During the 70's and 80's, a flood of new information on historical witchcraft became available. Levack's book is the best survey of this new data, which has revolutionized our understanding of the Great Hunt. It's not a very ""daring"" book; it sticks to the facts, to the things we're sure about. There isn't a lot of speculation in it. But it's a great antidote to the badly researched books, like Anne Barstow's _Witchcraze_, which flood the popular market."
2,This Might Be a Good Book...But Not For Me :(,"I was looking for a book about Witch-Hunt that is interesting to read, something like a novel. However, this book is more like a historical document that tells about the objective facts about Witch-Hunt and witchcraft. Also, this book is not written from a Christian perspective, and I somehow feel like the author is saying that it is okay to practice witchcraft. Just want to let readers be aware of this while reading."
5,School Book,I can't give a literary review as this is required reading for a college course I'm taking but do wish it had been offered as an ebook like my other book was - love my Kindle.
3,"I need some more hits,but this cd is ok","I really like NOW 12 because it has some late 2002 hits to early 2003 hits. I like Jay-Z and Beyonce's ""03 Bonnie and Clyde"",Snoop Dogg's ""Beautiful"",and 3 Doors Down's ""When I'm Gone"". And a list hits for NOW 13: Audioslave's ""Cochise"",B2K's ""Girlfriend"",Linkin Park's ""Somewhere I Belong"",Missy Elliott and Ludacris's ""Gossip Folks"",and 50 Cent's ""In Da Club"".Get this CD and go buy it now!"
3,"I don't know about the rest of the CD, but Chevelle rocks!!!","Oh my gosh, words cannot describe it! Chevelle is awesome. You must check out there latest CD, Wonder What's Next, its sooo killer!!!"
2,How bad this is,"This series of cds stink because the put on songs that were hits one month before they were put on this cd, so it gets a 69/100 D+!"
4,Now 12,Here is the Review song by song1.03 Bonnie and Clyde-I hate Beyonce but dig this 10/102.Bump Bump Bump-Not Bad 7/103.Jenny from the Block-good even thought samples KRIS 10/104.Don't mess with my man-Good 8/105.Luv U Better-Loved this one 10/106.Air Force Ones-Pretty entertaining 8/107.Made you look-Nas its Nas-Nas rules 10/108.Beautiful-Pretty Good 8/109.Blowin me up-Black Justin should have let his group sing 8/1010.Like I Love you-Black Justin does great here 10/1012.I Should be-I always like Dru Hill 9/1013.Stole-Kelly has some talent from Des Child 9/1014.Miss You-Love the Remix 10/1016.Pretty Baby-Like Vanessa 10/1020.When I'm gone-3 Doors Down for the troops 10/10137/150 This album does not suck actually this would bea 4.5 star release
2,pretty average but that works for these type of sets,"Nivea,B2k&Snoop Dogg have catchy cuts on this set.most of the songs on these Compilations are Hit&alot of Miss at best to me.take or leave alot of them but in there defense these type of sets put alot of the Artists into better perspective in that most are singles artists at best."
1,Now that's what I call dumb music...,"When the Now series first started, they included different genres of music other than ""pop"" music. Looking at the track lists lately for these CDs, it looks like the supposedly ""good"" music is only ""pop"" and ""hip hop"". These CDs have become quite a bit biased in the music choice. Sure, you can add these ""good"" songs... but it's a shame that the excellent songs are left off. This CD should get a low rating because the variety stinks."
4,I Like it But here are my suggestions for NOW 13,"1. Justin Timberlake ""Rock Your Body""2. R. Kelly ""Intignation""3. Nas ""I Can""4. T.A.T.U. ""All The Things She Said""5. J-Lo ""I'm Glad""6. Ja Rule/Ashanti ""Mesmerize""and many others as well"
3,"Well, well, well...what do you know! No Britney!","I think we can all realize that NOW releases all Britney's singles in every compilation...so there's no point to buy her albums! Now 12 is a good cd, but some songs are old and hardly were hits. I don't think the NOW producers give a hoot what the fans want. All they worry about is whether a record label will give permission to release a song into their compilation (NOW obviously has no trouble with Jive records!)Of course they can't release new singles like Cry me a River or J.Lo's duet with LL Cool J or else people will stop buying their albums! Oh well, let's continue hoping Now 13 will be better and maybe their will be less grumbling."
4,Great songs,"My favorite songs are Keith Urban's Somebody Like You, Jenny from the Block, and Pretty Baby. Overall very good class of music but I removed one star since the last song cuts off and skips in the CD I received. I now have to pay $1.29 on iTunes to find that song. OUCH!"
1,NOW US vs NOW UK,The UK series of NOW CD's seem to offer a hell of a lot better selection of music. I think the US consumers lose out.
1,worst NOW cd,This is the worst NOW cd that I have ever bought - my suggestion is that don't waste your money on it! NOW 10 was the best one so far; NOW 11 was just ok and NOW 12 is not good at all - I was so disappointed with this purchase that I will probably not be buying any NOW cd for a while.
2,Not the best NOW cd,"I have pretty much liked all the Now cd's..... this was my least favorite. Too much ghetto....I prefer ""mainstream"", good dance... This wasn't a very rounded group of songs and not most popular in my opinion. Hopefully the next one will be better."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED CASH FOR THIS!,This album is a complete FLOP! The others were much much better and I think they should stick to the old format. There are alot of songs that could have been on there that weren't. This is really the worst cd I've ever bought from this series and I have no idea why I did...
3,"Exactly 50/50, split down the middle","10/20 tracks are good2.5/5 stars - rounded to 3Those are:03 Bonnie And ClydeLuv U BetterMade You LookBeautifulStoleMiss YouAngelPretty BabyThe RedAlwaysThis is a pretty good Now CD. 13 and 19 are so much better, though."
2,Why buy it?,"I didn't buy this CD, but I don't need to. I just looked at the first like 10 songs listed. Yeah I've heard all of them, but why buy the CD? Most of them are all over the radio. Another thing about these NOW things- they need to expamd their genres a little. I mean there's some rock at the end but most of the songs are hip-hop. And if I have to hear ""bump, bump, bump"" one more time, I'll scream. So seriously- don't but NOW 12. Just turn on the radio."
2,not good,"One of the worst in the NOW series. Half these songs were not even popular when this CD came out. The only ones that I can even stand listening to are Jenny from the Block, Air Force Ones and Stole. Come on, NOW people! you can do better."
4,Clone Trooper Blaster,"This item was sold out everywhere (including Amazon.com for awhile) but was glad to find it for my son. Pretty simple toy but made a 4-year old's day. So far, it's everything he's wanted it to be. No problems with Amazon.com purchase and delivery process - made it 3 days before the birthday party."
4,Star Wars Blaster,I am dressing up as Princess Leia this year for a Halloween party I am attending. I had found a website that gave information about the costume and props. The website had referred to a blaster gun that Princess Leia carried with her in the movie. I was lucky enough to find the blaster gun on Amazon. I received the blaster gun very quickly. The sound effects are fun. I know that I will have a great time with this prop at my Halloween party.
4,great for fans of the movie,it was really for my son but we are both fans from the film. the blaster is a nice addition to his other blasters from the movie.
4,Nice bag for the price,"The bag is nice with good padding around the seams. The insulating material is a bit harder and denser than it appears in the picture. I really love the color of the bag. It would be great if it had handles. Good bag overall.Edited 12/22/07The item has started to fail. I use this on item everyday to store and transport my macbook 13.3. It travels inside another padded laptop bag. Recently, I noticed that the padding no longer sprung back in several places. As a result there were places where the case was flattened and the fabric covering the padding was puckered away--like a ripple. It looks strange but more importantly it is evidence that my notebook is not being protected.The case is attractive but not substantial enough to last more than six months. I would suggest purchasing a better made case."
4,Dr. John Pelizzari,"A masterpiece that is a must for any serious student of eschatolgy.Wonderfully written, thought provoking and doctrinally challenging to anyone who has put God into a religious box. A must read."
3,"Sound theory, dated content","This book is sound with regard to a potential strategy currently in play by the fallen prince of the air and his cohorts. That being said however, I was disappointed with the dated content of this book. Most of the references are from the late 70's-early 80's. Where is the current research and data? Apparently, despite a recent publication date, the author makes no attempt to incorporate any recent data. To me, it appears as if someone dug an old 1980's draft out of the closet and published it as ""new"". The book also suffers from a lack of good editing, particularly towards the end of the book (typos, repeats, etc.)."
4,supernatural,"This book has been out for some time but the subject matter is as timely as ever. The very real world of the super natural comes into focus. Those things which normally are passed by in the pulpit or ordinary conversation are revealed and exposed for what they are. This is a no holds bared look into the dimension of angels, demons,sons of God and the nephilim. Very worth reading."
5,One Of the Best Books Ever Written,"First and foremost I am a Christian. Since I've been a child I've been fascinated by UFOs and Alien life. My father was an Assistant Pastor of our church for over twenty years and he always said, if aliens did exist, they were demons.I read this book and truly couldn't put it down. I don't want to spoil it for you but it paints a parallel between Genesis 6 and modern times.Do we really know what is going to be coming upon this earth? Think outside of the box, put perceived reality aside, and get this book. Highly recommended."
5,Truth,"I bought this book for my son for his birthday and also Books of Enoch 1,2,3 and the books have been a marvelous investment. I also purchased the same books for myself.Some times your left with unanswered questions when you read the Bible. That statement is not meant to be negative about the Bible. I am now enjoying my 15th Bible Study Class and The Omega Conspiracy has openned my eyes to questions I had and did not get answers. I have endured the looks that others give me because I question certain events in the Bible. I am grateful that I.D.E. Thomas wrote The Omega Conspiracy."
5,Great for long runs,"This is a great product, but if you have a run that is longer than the cable, you have to extend the length by splicing cat 5e cable into it."
4,Nice workout,Pretty but not as realistic as I thought it would be. The heart rate info is helpful but I would rather not see the guy on the screen for the entire ride.
5,Great reach,"This clamp is a must. So many times do you need a strong, deep clamp to reach. This will do the job."
2,Don't use with a Mac,"The Kensiington Pilot Mouse requires that my bluetooth-equipped iMac rediscover the mouse each time the computer wakes from sleep mode. Kensington's website states the mouse is compatible with Macs, but this is true only if you're willing to keep your corded mouse connected or use your keyboard to rediscover the Kensington mouse each time you use your computer.Three contacts with Kensington's tech support were no help.I gave the mouse a two-star rating insted of one star because when the mouse does work, it works well. If only it worked as it's advertised by Kensington, it would be great. If you're looking for a wireless mouse for your Mac, avoid this one."
2,"Huge mouse, burns batteries.",I have big hands and this mouse was huge. It burned batteries like crazy. I returned it and bought the Kensington Mini Pilot Bluetooth Mouse which has an on/off switch - a feature all wireless mouse should have. I have yet to replace the batteries in that model and I've had it for over a month.
1,Kensington 72225 Bluetooth Mouse,"Ok. Kensington 72225 Bluetooth Mouse. Nice ergonomics, comfortable to use, but!!! This mouse use too much power from rechargeble battery. Every two-three days I need to change battery!"
4,"Very stylish, reliable","Very stylish and reliable product. It does not have the range (30ft) as advertised - was only able to use it a maximum of ~5ft from PC. The batteries seemed to go out a little faster than I had expected and if the unit is not right next to my laptop, it seems to get choppy."
1,Beware mac users,"The mouse worked fine after the imac discovered it, but, I tried to put the computer to sleep, it does for a split second, then the desktop reappears, the curser turns into a spinning beach ball, you can't do a thing with the keyboard or mouse, and the fan in the computer went into high speed, freaking my wife out! All that I could do was shut down with the power button. I restarted and I had to have the mouse ""rediscovered"")!! The computer works fine with the apple blue tooth mouse and the Kensington USB mouse. I called tech and they said that wasn't normal, then I read the reviews! Wish I had read them first!!!"
2,LIES - ALL LIES!!!!,"This is my last Kensington Purchase. Not because the mouse is bad. It works fine. HOWEVER - I purchased this because of Kensington's amazing MouseWorks software for the mac.* Driver download says that it supports bluetooth mice.* On-line and physical owners manual says it works with MouseWorks* NO WHERE on Kensington's web site does it say this mouse is incompatible with MouseWorks.Tech support comes back with the response of ""So Sorry"". Bite Me Kensington...you lost a dedicated customer who loves to spend money and was previously in love with your products."
5,I love this book!,I'm Korean. So my English is not so fluent.But this book was very easy to understand and very kind.
5,I wish I had this book when I first started!,"I am just a small quilt pattern publisher that started without knowing anything about the pattern business. I wish I had this book when I first started! Nancy's book is no nonsense and answers those questions like, ""Where do I begin?"", ""How do I get my pattern in the hands of the buyer?"" and ""How much do I charge for my pattern?"" It is a reference that I will refer to again and again. Anyone considering publishing their own patterns needs this book!"
4,A gold mine for any designer,"OK, I'm not a quilter. And I have no plans on self-publishing paper patterns.Still, I have a learnt a LOT of useful things in this book! My copy has paper clips on many pages, to mark the chapters I want to refer to in my work.A very interesting book for any textile designer!"
4,WHAT A BOOK !,"Advanced for it's time and still applicable today! This book is fascinating. Frankly, I am surprised that this book hasn't been reprinted. No matter who I've shown this book to, once they scan the pages, they are amazed and interested in this theory. It does work! Plants are easy proof. New Age theorists should have this book as ""required reading"". You wouldn't be dissapointed."
5,Comprehensive Overview,"A wonderful and comprehensive look at exactly what the title says: this business of books! Lots of info on the industry, publishing options, book concepts, editing, the submission process and much much more. As a nonfiction writer with little fiction experience, I was delighted with the section on building characters. The multi-page questionnaire opened doors to characterization I'd never thought of before. An incredible and helpful overview of the industry I couldn't do without."
2,Mixed bag of information,"Disappointing. The author created a grab-bag of topics, giving the impression of seeking to fill enough pages to make a book."
3,New York Gong - 'About Time' (JVC),"'About Time' was originally released in 1980.Guitarist/vocalist Daevid Allen is the only charter Gong member on this record.Bill Laswell is on bass and Bill Bacon is the drummer.At this time period for the most part other Gong members were busy,involved in their own side projects.'About Time' is a so-so lp,nice job on the CD reissue I must say.For the most part,I pretty much liked the disc's last three tracks the best,the somewhat tripping ""O My Photograph"",""Hours Gone"" and ""Jungle Window"".Great job on the lp's reproduced art work."
3,"Great book, but appalling Kindle edition!","This is a very good book. Bettina Selby writes eloquently and evocatively, and takes the reader with her on her extraordinary journey.But the Kindle edition is terrible. The publisher seems to have processed all the pages as illustrations rather than text, which means that they only fill the middle column of the Kindle's screen, I have to press the page turn button twice to turn each page, and the usual Kindle options for words per line and font size do not work. There is an index but this too is presented like an illustration and so is not interactive. This is the kind of thing that would now be unacceptable in a free edition - but the publishers want you to pay for this!The Kindle edition of this book desperately needs to be reissued with the text properly processed."
4,Great Rock-Tee,"I really love the way this Eagles Tee looks, very rock 'n roll! I ordered an XL because I like my shirts to fit a bit loose, am really glad that I did because this shirt fits a bit snug. The material has a nice feel to it & is a little thinner than most of my T-shirts, so it's good for hot weather days. The screen-print design is vintage-looking, just as pictured. Looks great w/ jeans or shorts, topped w/ a denim or leather jacket & you're ready to rock! If you're an Eagles fan like I am, this is a cool shirt to buy!"
3,it's ok,"This one was alright, it had a few good moments, u can expect the same type of content as the rest of the freak shows, I've always dug the freak show series. Vol.3 is much much better. I've seen something on that vol that i haven't seen on any other."
5,First Rate All The Way!,"Connor's Crossing, Texas 1874This story has it all! Heart-pumping adventure, sensual desire with twist and turns mysteries through out! If you love westerns, this is a must read! Don't pass it up!"
4,DON'T PASS ON THIS ONE!,"From the back of the book ******** WILD GUNFIRE.... THUNDERING HORSES..... A CAREENING STAGECOACH -- WAS THIS ANY WAY TO FIND TRUE LOVE?? .. Rede Smith didn't thins so, yet the Texas Ranger hadn't counted on the brave and beautiful Addy Kelly, whose tender mercies and intoxicating touch gave him hope for a life free of the dark secret that plagued him.Respectable widow Adelaide Kelly had a secret: She was neither a widow nor respectable in small-town eyes.But the scandal her diverced status would create paled beside the shocking fact that she'd allowed the rugged Rede Smith into her home, heart and deepest deires. ********If you like westerns - you will thoroughly enjoy this one.There is so much more than is hinted at and the twists keep you wanting more -- Addy saves Rede [from quite a lot] and of course they take on the outlaws - grin - you will like the pace of this story - definitely recommend."
4,good live music,"This CD is redundant with Polygram's two-disk ""Black Myth/Out in Space"" release. It's from live sets of the Arkestra's European tour around 1970.Sun Ra's music can be described as big band jazz that is frequently dissonant. In any Sun Ra performance, some tracks are sort of afro bossa with lots of percussion; some are straight-ahead bebop; some are swing tunes; and some are atonal improvision like Cecil Taylor's. The level of musicianship is very high. Sun Ra's music is both sophisticated and spirited. Any Sun Ra album will keep a true music lover absorbed for many playings.If you are just starting to get into Sun Ra, I recommend the Evidence's CDs, remastered versions of albums from Ra's Saturn label in the 1960s."
2,Keep shopping,"This music from an early-70s concert is great. The only reason for the low ranking is that all these tracks are available on ""Black Myth/Out in Space [LIVE],"" available in August 2005 from Amazon. The latter release gives you two CDs, not one, from two concerts, not one - and for a slightly lower price. ""End of World,"" however, gives you cool cover art by Jerome Bosch."
5,Before Mariah There was...,"Desiree was the first person I ever heard hit those high notes like Minnie Ripperton! As a young pre-teen I listened to her debut album over and over trying to sing like her. Unfortunately I no longer have this cassette, but I do remember some of the highlights: ""To Stay Together"" ""You Wouldn't Hurt Me"" and ""Romance"". Definitely worth the buy for any urban 80's lover."
1,Vegetable Lubricant,"I found out what this ingredient called ""Vegetable Lubricant"" is. Here is the complete response from the vendor:Vegetable lubricant is a fatty acid, known as stearic acid, sourced from palm, and used in small amounts to prevent the tablets from sticking to our equipment during the manufacturing process.It is up to you to decide whether it is harmful or not, but as for me, I am not taking it. So I have returned the product."
5,A Must,"My grown children follow these rules of ""Good Manners"" now as adults. In recent months my 30 year old's puppy demolished this most referenced book in her ""library"". I am replacing it with ""haste""."
3,Favorites Made Easy and Simply,"Very minimalist describes the approach to this collection of favorites. From Boston Baked Beans to Coq Au Vin, this has the recipes we all enjoy.Receiving this one free is likely the only way I would have this in my collection. I have others that I turn to for more inspiration on American cooking, such as Sheila Lukens ""USA Cooking"" which is exceptional, or James Beard's ""American Cooking.""This is not worthless or poorly done, it is just too bland for my tastes, such as a simple Meat Loaf with the ketschup smeared on the top. Many will gravitate to this food, so to each his own meatloaf."
4,Recommended,"The young Governor John K. Stratton of Maryland starts his race for the White House only to have his personal life fall apart. Already troubled by his family's history, John has a chance encounter with his high school sweetheart, Kimberly, that ends up throwing his life even more off balance.As his campaign moves forward, strange and sinister things start happening. A young undercover cop suddenly turns up dead, his brother ends up shot, and Kimberly is becoming a more frequent guest in his dreams. But when things finally come to a head, an explosion of obstacles threaten John's campaign, as well as, the new love that had just begun to grow.**** This one is definitely a good read! I simply had to know what was going to happen next and ended up losing a lot of sleep. This suspense filled book will grab hold of its readers and refuse to let go. Recommended! ****Reviewed by K. Blair"
5,A Page Turner!!!,"When I started to read this book I could not put it down. I loved it!! He gracefully brings history to life as if the individuals of the past were alive. I recommend this book it will open your eyes to the true evil brought about by the crusades, and you will go to feel compassion and pity for the Templars."
3,Pretty good overview for the lay person,"but adds nothing that hasn't been said 1000 other times if you've read one historical book on the Templars. Nevertheless, a lot better written than most of the books on the templars. Bottom line, very basic stuff, but at least it is well written"
3,Incorrect history,"Dungeon, Fire and Sword is an excellent read, especially if you want a deeper knowledge of how and why in the crusader years. Unfortuantly the author fancy himself more of a writer than a historian and therefore sometimes transform events into being, perhaps not totally in response to the historical facts. But if you already know a bit about history, you can sort this out, and then you have a well written, very informative book on a sometimes dry subject. I learned alot, but from what I already know, I also know enough to know that what I learned may not be entirely correct. But a good read non the less."
5,EXCELLENT AND INFORMATIVE READ,"Not being an expert in this area, I certainly cannot vouch for each and every fact and item the author has offered us. But I can state that this is quite a well written book and from what I can tell, well researched. I have taken the time to check of several of the facts the author has given us, and so far, have failed to find any fault. This is a fascinating story about a fascinating group of men during a rather important era in our history. We are still reaping the consequences from the actions taken in those days. To understand what is happening in the world today, I feel it is important to understand how we got here and this work sheds light on that subject. Like another reviewer here, I would also have appreciated more maps and certainly mor source references. Overall though, I found this work to be quite good, quite imformative and I feel very wothwhile. Highly recommend."
5,Excellent History!,"Well looks like its all been said already, this is a great book, it covers not only the Order of the Knights Templar but the Crusades as well, what more could you ask for? The narrative is rich with history, people and places and the author conveys the times well. This is a great story and leaves you wanting to know more about these people and the times in which they lived. A well presented and easy to read account, buy a copy and enjoy!"
2,Not really a history of the Templars,"If you want a good read on the Templars, this is not it. It is more a history of the crusades that tries to highlight the role of the Templars in the broader story. I got just as much info on the Templars from Runciman's far better history of the crusades than I did from this book. I would strongly recommend his works instead (Runciman is a wonderfully readable historian, a bit like Tuchman or John Norwich, although better)."
1,Fun to Read; Lousy History,"Truly a mess. No footnotes, lots of speculation, and plenty of cafeteria-style history (""I'll take one of these facts, and one of those...""). May appeal to the ""rum and strumpets"" fans but an absolute disaster of a 'history' book. If you want a book about the Crusades, stick with Runciman: not so much blood and garishness, but you won't be led astray. ""Dungeon, Fire and Sword"" is a dreadful book guaranteed to be warmly embraced by those who don't know any better."
1,Same old song in a new cover!,"Robinson's workignores the new findings on these Knights. Are you kidding? He really believes these men banded together to be the good samaritans of thechurch world? When entire armies no nine men could stnd. It's ridiculous. Better to read the new material than this rehased moldy stuff. Seek out Ken Agori, or Barb Thiering.Forget this."
1,Ignorance as History,"A completely worthless volume. The author obviously has only a superficial knowledge of either the Crusades or the Templars. While not as ""nutty"" as much of the myth filled literature that surrounds the Templars, the book is replete with factual errors and poorly written. There is also a strong anti-Catholic bias throughout the text. A book to be avoided by any serious scholar of this period."
5,Best low-carb pasta on the market!!,I've tried many low-carb pastas and Dreamfields is by far the best! It tastes just like regular pasta!
1,Disappointing,"Overwrought, overwritten, and highly derivative. The reviews led me to expect a lot more from this work than it delivers."
1,Dont waste your time and money,"this is a horrible cartoon. poorly written, unoriginal, and extremely boring. its one of the worst new shows cartoon network is deciding to air for some reason when they could be airing GOOD shows like billy and mandy. Avoid this show, dont waste your money."
3,Street Spanish 3,"I was somewhat disappointed to find out that this book is remarkably similar (nearly identical) to Street Spanish 2. Had I known this, I certainly would not have purchased 3."
4,Street Spanish 3,"This is a MUST read for anyone who is even slightly interested in communicating with real Spanish speaking people. The cartoons are well drawn, the scenarios are hilarious, the usage examples are realistic and very funny, the vocabulary is creative and alive, and the variables for differing countries are exact. This book demonstrates the color of Spanish ... but DO NOT take it to church!"
2,Way too many mistakes!,"THe author's literal translation of, ""echar los perros"" is, ""to throw dogs"".The book even has a picture of a man with a sack full of dogs that he is throwing at a girl.He tells us that it means to flirt.The literal translation is, ""to sick the dogs on...(a girl,guy,etc.)""It means to court,woo...(a girl,guy, etc.) He sais that conejo,rabbit, is a bad word in Mexico.It may be a bad word in another country,not in Mexico.I found a bit too many mistakes when it comes to Mexican slang that it makes me question the entire book."
4,good for a laugh or two,If you're intent on sharpening your street Spanish..this fun-filled volume does a nice job.I'm glad I bought it.Easy to read and reasonably priced.
4,Useful,"Wile most of the information contained in this book can be found on the internet, having a paper book next to you for quick access is still nice when writing. The content at times is rudimentary but solid. I found it very helpful for checking minor grammatical nuances that I found myself to be slightly hazy on.If you require a serviceable book on undertaking a large research assignment and don't know where to turn this book can be your go to guide."
2,Only scratches the surface...,"After reading other works on Dorothy Dandrige I thought this purported autobiograph left a few things to be desired. The book reveals personal details of her life but downplays certain players in her life. For example, the lesbian relationship between her mother and ""friend"" Auntee was passed off as being no more than a casual friendship. I understand DD reasons for not revealing things about her mother considering she was still alive at the time the book was published. She only mention a few details about her fame with the movie CARMEN.The book is written well but only takes a cursory view of her life and success. It seems to accentuates the most tragic details of her life and downplays her contribution to others. It's a good book, but please read Donald Bogle's book if you want a more thorough revelation of her life."
3,"Lies, Lies...and more Lies?",Some of Dorothy's closest friends and associates claim this book is full of lies and that Dandridge wrote it because she was desperate for money. They cringe at how Earl Conrad sensationalized this book by making Dorothy a slut just to make a dollar. You never know who's talking...Earl or Dorothy? I read this book when it came out many years ago because it was the only book available about Dorothy Dandridge. Since that time several books and videos that offer a more accurate account of her life have been released.
5,You Must Buy This Book !!!,"My only complaint is it was only 238 pages . I belive Cusumano could entertain me for months . A must for a t.v. mini series or a movie. To compare this would be injust.The writer is in a class alone,excellent.I can,t say enough. Would love to know more about the author.Date of next book please.I'm a buyer."
2,more italian-american culture,"If the entire book was as inspiring and beautiful as the lastcouple of chapters, it would be an all time favorite for me.I was kind of disappointed and confused by all the kids, all thenames, nicknames, and various unclear first person narratives.As for its historical accuracy and some of the character development, it was quite good in these areas."

5,Victorinox sleeve,We had one of these sleeves that came with a Victorinox case we had purchased. My son dropped his lap top in a regular padded case and broke a corner and the cd romm. He now carries his new one in one of these cases inside his back pack. The laptop is protected with the cross suspension. You can also hook a strap to it if you want with the loops. We purchases another seperately for my other son's laptop and it protects it well. It is firm all the way around for protection and the laptop slips in nicely. There is no room for anything else. Both laptops are Macbooks.
5,Excellent!,You will love this book. It will capture your attention from the very first page. You won't want to put it down. A MUST read!
4,First three tracks are completely worth it,"The first three tracks on disc one -- Praying Mantra, Democracy and Satellite Serenade -- absolutely make this worth the purchase. As another reviewer has said, make no mistake that you are getting pure Orb goodness. This absolutely feels like an Orb album and not a mish-mash of songs by other artists. The rest of the tracks on the CDs have their moments, but I keep going back to disc one over and over. At this point with the CDs having been out for so long, look at it as getting three fabulous songs for a few bucks and the rest of the album is bonus material."
2,Shame on me for trying it again!,"I actually love Orville Redenbacher's popcorn, but this is the 2nd (and last) time I purchase it through Amazon. Both times it has been stale. Yuck!"
5,"money, art, a broken heart, where did you want to go?","I have been a Concrete Blonde fan since I was twelve years old. They remain my favorite band. I have seen them live several times in the last 13 years. I along with a myriad of other devotees have been waiting patiently for an official live album. Johnette and co. deliver. Johnette's voice is coated in its usual velvet and explodes from its hard core (hence the concrete blonde metaphor). The band retains integrity with a lack of pretense as usual. I am completely satiated by this release.Among the standout tracks, I recommend: ""Valentine"" for the sheer rage of it, ""Everybody Knows"" the Cohen cover is spat out with such venom live, ""Little Conversations"" good to hear this one again,""Mexican Moon"" conjures its usual duende and callus warnings.In short. . .I love this band's work. Live In Brazil finds them still socially relevant and in peak form."
3,Recording not up to par,"I am a huge fan of Concrete Blonde, but I found the sound recording of this ""live"" performance disappointing. It's good but not great. Other reviewers have stated they loved the variations on the group's standard songs, but I wasn't all that impressed."
1,Do not buy this CD...,"If you care about respecting the office of the President or think that American musicians should refrain from insulting George Bush in front of international audiences, then don't buy this CD. I have been a fan of Concrete Blonde for 15+ years, and while I was disappointed by Group Therapy, I was completely turned off by Live in Brasil. I will admit that the recording was well done, and I was enjoying the album up until the attack on our President, but because of her silly rant, I will no longer support Concrete Blonde. There are plenty of listeners who will overlook or be ammused by the insult to Bush, but entertainers should learn to keep their mouths shut about politics, and U.S. citizens should be more outraged by those who disrepect the office of the president on foreign soil. You salute the rank, not the man."
3,For beginners only,"While this book might be good for beginners, it didn't meet my needs for a good Robo X3 reference. It's well-written, but before buying, be sure that what you want is a training manual, not a well-indexed and throrough reference to Robo X3."
1,broken,"I recived these earrings and one was broken, they looked lovely but was broken and had to return."
1,bad earrings,These earrings were a scam.l sent them right back. The jade stones were about a quarter of an inch and the clasps did not work. Don't get taken in by their add.
3,Interesting but dated,"I have one of the old hardback ones. Speaking as a Freemason, the rituals are a bit dated, but good enough for a curious nonMason. The ""higher"" degrees are more out of whack than the first three, with some confusion over titles and I've never seen or heard of some of these degrees, but IIRC, the original publish date on this book was 1860 and I know the Scottish Rite bodies were revised after that. I'm not sure about the York Rite."
5,monitor,Helpful reading. I was able to find the information that i was looking for.in addition to further information that i found interesting.
3,Richardson's Monitor of Freemasonry,"Although the book is a rare find, I am not impressed with the reproduction effort. I expected large type and illustrations that fit the page it's printed on. That's what I thought I was getting.F. L. Williams Jr."
5,A good book,"It is definitely a book worth reading. For a week or so, it actually inspired me to go to med school. (I quickly gave it up when I picked up Sam Walton's Made in America, and applied to business school) The author has a very interesting view of death, which is in my opinion, why people think the second half of the book is a little wacky. You don't have to agree with her, nor believe in everything she says. Despite all the wackiness, it's still a good book."
5,Truly Amazing,"The first and certainly not the last book I will be reading of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. This unforgetable reading of Kubler Ross's life will remain inspirational throughout my own work with the terminally ill. I simply could not put the book down and read it from start to finish with many tears involved, not all tears of sadness but of sheer amazement at the commitment, love and dedication Kubler Ross displayed towards others throughout her life. I admired her strength for never giving up what she believed in even though others made it difficult for her along the way.The Wheel of Life is a remarkable book written by a remarkable woman. It MUST be read!."
4,Liked it,It's a good book for spiritual reading and prepares for the life’s' inevitable end which we all have to embrace one day or experience for a loved one.
4,great book,"I heard from other people about this book and that's why I read it. I loved the first part of the book as Dr Ross explores and teaches the importance of telling a dying person the truth about their condition and to honor their last wishes. As the book progressed into the ""afterlife"" and all it's ramifications such as ""visions"" and the ""bright light"", I was less enthused. However she backs her teachings with hundreds of interviews so who am I to say?"
4,Whew! A real roller coaster ride,"Those of us who gained immensely from Kubler-Ross' first book ""On death and dying"" will be interested to read her final book. And what a dichotomy from the first! Instead of a carefully reasoned, almost scientific treatise on the subject of life and death, Kubler-Ross throws us onto the roller coaster that has been her life. Unsatisfactory relationships, a definite superiority complex (Kubler-Ross is always right) and a profound belief that her life has eveolved the way it has in order for her to learn the lessons she needs to - and yet mysterious and thought-provoking. The way in which she refers to her ""spooks"" (her term), the spirit guides which live with her each day, and her encounters with out of body experiences leave us more grounded souls with a high degree of scepticism. And yet ... Read this book and make up your mind for yourself."
1,Good Start - Wacky Finish,"I just finished this book, and am sorry to say I was just shaking my head by the end of it. The beginning was fine and interesting, following her journey from childhood to medical school. Something went wrong in her life when she was in her 40's, and that's when the story got wacky. It was probably the California life-style of the 1970's and all the garbage about channeling the other side, etc. I wanted so badly to plead with her to go back to her family and raise her children instead of running around the country searching for who knows what. It really was quite flaky as she told of spirits having long conversations with her. This poor woman was seeing and hearing things that were not there. She seemed so lost spiritually, and it sounded as though she was estranged from her family. I do not discount her work with the stages of dying, this was an important contribution. But if love was the most important thing of all, that goal seemed elusive to her. Very sad."
1,Where is my item ?,"I never received my product. I only purchased this product as it was of very sentimental value to my mother, however I was bitterly dissapointed to find the product was lost in transit. I would love to say amazon made every effort to find my product, I personally could not believe this to be true. I do appreciate the jesture of a full refund, but I can honestly say I feel totally dishartened by the whole ordeal. I only purchased from amazon as I knew the item was difficult to locate but to pay almost 13 dollars for it to be lost is in my opinion both unacceptable and extremly unsatisfactory. I shall not purchase from amazonm in the future."
2,Not the cult classic you were hoping for.,"Things sucks. It just does, I'm really sorry, but it's not the ""so bad it's good"" classic you may have heard it was. It is, in fact, utterly horrible. Throughout it's running time (which is gonna seem like ten years if you try to sit through this) it manages to stay stupid, but never does it become funny or entertaining. I love Birdemic, The Room, Hobgoblins, Shark Attack 3: Megaladon, and all those wonderful movies as much as the next nerd, but this- this is a different animal. What we have here seems to be a movie that was taken seriously on set, but upon viewing the footage for the audio dub, the film makers came upon the realization that what they had was not salvageable. So, they just goofed off... And then they released it anyway. And now it sucks. I wish that I could have told myself this before I spent the twenty bucks I wasted on Things, but perhaps I can save you... Don't buy it."
1,"Things (don""t waste your money)","I found this movie to be very boring!! Bad Acting, Bad directing and very low quality. If you like watching something rather amateurish then maybe its for you. Lots of fake blood and attempts of grossness. If you are thinking sexiness, there is very little. I was disappointed with my purchase."
1,Worst...,"Movie ever.I have seen better public access,not enough splatter or gore.The first Canadian horror film released on v.h.s and I hope was the last,Do not buy.The end"
1,Garbage,"This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. I watch SOV films all the way to big budgets like Lord of the Rings and this is by far one of the worst pieces of garbage. Terrible directing, editing, acting, fx, the film has nothing and these reviewers were obviously on crack or paid to write what they wrote DO NOT BUY OR RENT save your cash for the next Twilight movie...that's how bad it is I said go see a Twilight movie instead."
1,Save your money,Program is difficult to use. Basic functionality such as inserting a sink didn't work properly (able to insert only pedestal sink). Couldn't find any online help from either Broderbund or Encoreusa for this product.
1,Hidden Truth,"I think Mr. Juarez forgot to mention why he was thrown off the police department. Perhaps the fact that he was a substance abuser could have altered his perception of what went on during his time on the force. I only read this book because he likes to exploit deceased officers and I wated to make sure a family member of mine was not used in his ""story"".If the only career left for Juarez is as an author, perhaps he should just retire and live off his 5 minutes of fame."
5,The best gift for a friend or yourself!,"I found this adorable, helpful book while browsing for a gift for a newly-single friend, and I found myself reading it every time I went to her house. Of course, I ended up buying it for myself--it has incredibly useful instructions for little chores you wish you knew how to do, from entertaining (choosing wine, setting a table, cooking an artichoke) to cosmetics (trimming your own bangs, tweezing your eyebrows) to safety."
5,Fun Gift,I passed it out at a shower over the weekend to my girlfriends and they loved it! Good practical stuff as well as some fun suprises. My great aunt also chuckled over the topics.
2,Good Material Poor Format,"I saw Tony's power point presentation live and it was very good. I got this to share with some collegues, but that was a mistake. Although the material is similar the fake interview format with no visual aids and no movement is very hard to sit through."
5,wonderful recipes that you can make at home,"La Cachette, Meteigner's restaurant, is one of my favorite restaurants in LA. I am a big fan of French cuisine but often find it too rich to eat every day and too time intensive to cook often. The nouvelle French recipes in this book are intense without being overly rich. Also, most competent cooks can handle these recipes in the home kitchen. For wonderful and fancy traditional French check out The French Laundry Cookbook."
5,Eilizabeth David Goes Silver Palate,"He just gets itWonderful recipes with good but not overwhelming directions. Light adaptations of traditional favorites without any loss of flavor. This is now dog eared and much used and sits alongside David, Olney and others."
3,Well....,"I ordered this as a gift; the ornaments are beautiful, BUT the storage box has ""2005 collection"" printed on the lid. Bah. I'm going to give her something else now, because I'm afraid she'll think I'm re-gifting something I got last year."
3,good product tortise loves it. I know when he eats it as his mouth turns red.,"I rated it 3 , stars because the package leaks in transit. This causes the food to dry out. In the last year I bought 4 of these.1 was good1 was dried out with outside of the container showing dried up leak1 replaced the above & the vendor taped all around the lid,this one was the best1 had a small leak but was not dried out"
1,misleading product description,"it was writen in product features: comprised of 100% all-natural d-alpha tocopherols. But actually the vitamin I received was tocopheryl, as was writen in the label of the botle. I consider this a disonest practice, to advertise something and sell another."
3,Nothing Special,"A ho-hum effort at best. There is no real structure, just odd clips and generally boring interviews with ""yeah, I knew Bob...."" The anecdotes were mostly uninteresting...the piece was weak."
3,Need instructions!!!,This should include a instruction guide of what tip does what. I'm lost and now having to search the Internet for more info.
4,"They do a great job, but...","I would really like to know what each individual piece does. They give a generic on the back and dont specify which does which. I don't think it would have been too hard to have a small leaflet inside depicting what they do.But, I have had lots of fun already! I made a cake for my sons 7th B-day to take to school. All the teachers were impressed (and I mean all, they had to say hey come look at this!). I keep coming up with new things I need to get for my kitchen! I'm an easy woman to please for present times-get me something having to do with kitchen equiptment and I'm good!Oh, also, if they are going to include tips that needs a biggers coupler, they should have included the coupler. I really want to try them, but know its probably not going to be for a while till I can get into Billings to get to a Michaels or something."
3,NOT TOO BAD,I received these and noticed some were slightly bent. They will still do the job as they are not too bad. It was packaged o.k and the tubes stay in place.
5,A great set for everything you need!,"As an amateur baker, I was looking for a set of piping tips that would allow me to easily decorate cakes while being able to learn new techniques over time. The assortment of tips in this kit is insane! You can easily make any type of border, star, or flower that you could ever dream of. As mentioned before, it would be nice if there was a better guide for what each tip does, but that's what the internet and experimentation is for. The tips are solid metal and are of good quality- they won't bend or warp. The coupler works well in Wilton featherweight bags (I used mine in the 12 inch), while the individual tips also work well (I used the 8 inch bag). It's also convenient that they come in a case where each piece has a place. It's definitely a purchase I am glad that I made."
5,Great selection,I am a beginner cake decorator and I could not imagine needing more than tips than is in this box. It would have been good to have some form of printed guide for the effects each tip produces and it is a pain that there was no large coupler included as I am having trouble finding one and it would be very useful. On the whole I am happy.
4,"Great tips, case sucks","As others have stated the case is less than stellar. The tips are awesome, and cover just about everything you could need."
2,Wrong Tip Holder,My kit came with two small plastic tips holders. Unfortunately the kit comes with many medium sized tips that won't fit on them.
1,Don't Be Fooled!,"The Product Description states that this is Made in the USA.When it arrives you find out it is ""Assembled in the USA"" of imported material.Very misleading."
1,Good luck,"I just received this today and what was promised to be a 55 piece set with 52 tips was actually a 43 piece set - 1 case, 2 nails, a coupler and 39 tips."
3,Liked the tips,"The tips are wonderful, however the case is flimsy and the latch broke the first time I tried to open it."
4,Nice,"These are nice, high-quality decorating tubes. I love having the variety. I do wish that the container they came in was a little better. The tubes are always coming loose and rattling around, making it hard to close and the pieces for making roses don't really fit very well. Also, a very nice addition to this would be a little booklet of instructions/information. I'm not sure if they just assume you know how to use all of these if you are getting them or what, but this came with nothing at all in that regard."
2,"started to rust, tip#143","I tend to soak my tips over night when we use them to get rid of the icing inside. The next day I would clean, rinse, and dry them off. I than realize there was rust inside tip# 143. Very disappointed in this product, this is made of stainless steel. Also this was the first time using tip#143, we had other tips inside the bowl where we soak the tips and this was the only one with this issue. Never had this problem before with my other tips."
2,Cheap,"I have never owned another compass so I can't really judge this one too well but I bought it for survival/camping purposes. I can't see this thing surviving very long. I like my equipment to be light but also strong enough to not get damaged. The button does not click, it just rests so anything that snags/pushes it releases the hands again."
2,Compass,You get what you pay for - it is good for children to learn but wouldn't recommend it for adult use.
3,I had mixed feelings....,"I am teaching astronomy to 5 little boys, and I ordered these for the chapter dealing with the earth's magnetism, and how that effects our universe. Admittedly they are the less expensive kind, so I did not expect a lot. However, one of the 4 that I ordered was broken when I got it. I need to send it back, but it is vexing. As far as I know, the other three are still working."
1,Igia Pore Cleaner,We purchased this pore cleaner but it had no instructions on how to load the batteries. In the process of trying to figure this out the unit broke so we were never able to use it. In addition it cost more for the mailing than the product.
1,Dont bother getting this Pore Cleanser,"Igia Pore Cleanser prodoct arrived pretty quickly(THAT IS A PLUS). But when I tried to insert the correct batteries for the Igia Pore Cleaner they would not go in, I had to forse them in. When I moved the switch to ON it did nothing. So I played with the batteries because I thought I put them in wronge, but it does tell you on the cap which way the batteries should go in. So after an hour of playing with it I had concluded that it was broken when it arrived that is why it would not work. I was kinda mad that I had purchased a broken good, and that they gave me a broken good. Overall displeased with my purchase."
4,"Pinetop Seven fans, take note","Can't really pick standout tracks on an album of this consistency and unity. Charles Kim has a very specific sound and feel he is going for, and you can hear here exactly which parts of the Pinetop Seven sound are attributable to Kim. It's an interesting record, very beautiful, but as a Pinetop Seven fan, I can't help feeling like I'm hearing a demos of Pinetop Seven songs that don't yet have words. But this is no bad thing, and when taken on its own merits, as it should be, this is an exceptional record. The last song falls somewhere between Boxhead Ensemble and the Dirty Three, and many of the players here, including Kim, are also associated with Boxhead Ensemble. Anniversary is not quite a match for the Ensemble's masterpiece ""Two Brothers,"" but it is a very striking listen and one of finest instrumental albums of the year."
3,Not his best work but...,"I have to agree with the majority of reviews here. It's not his best work, really a moderately typical sword and sorcery novel. Gory in parts, though I wouldn't call it a horror novel, and if you're used to Green, a bit less gory than some of the reviews indicate.I thought, due to the name of one of the characters, that there would be a few typical Green puns--I kept waiting to see, ""Stop. Hammer time,"" or at least ""You can't touch this."" Green seems to take himself a bit more seriously in this novel. (If he'd used either of those puns, I'd have raised my rating from a 3 to 4, but...).The book is from 1994, and I think Green was still finding his voice at that time."
3,Reads like a movie novel...,"not the best Dark Wood story, in my opinion. But if you enjoyed Blue Moon Rising and Blood and Honor, you will still enjoy Down Among the Dead Men. Its just an interesting little side story in the Dark Wood series. be forewarned, its pretty gritty and gory..."
2,Not enough information to understand letters,"Frances Mossiker's book is really the best source for the Madame's letters, as it offers information about people and the era and much of the original letters. I recommend that book instead."
1,Madame besmirched,"The letters are fascinating and the book is a jewel, but the cover was tatty, with felt pen crudely obliterating prices on old stickers,etc., pages foxed and dog eared, much text moronically underlined with ball-point. Madame S. would be horrified. I shall never buy from these liars again. C'est la guerre."
3,Uneven sound quality buries some great stuff,"Really enjoyed Hopkins' Texas Blues on Arhoolie and figured the ""best of"" would be more of the same. However, the uneven sound quality (which changes drastically from song to song) is annoying. Great versions of Mojo Hand and Please Settle in Vietnam survive intact, but several others, including a great alternate take of Tim Moore's Farm, are ruined by noise. Buy Texas Blues and look elsewhere for the other tracks."
4,what's a piper cub,"i'm a might biased, as i was raised and nurtured with a 1946 j3 cub..with my dad in the rear seat and myself in the front..i was convinced at 7 years old that i was the pilot!...with that said,, i found mr weaton's book both innocent and charming...and purchased it for my 10 year old daughter...who will hopefully become a fledgeling aviation enthusiast!...she loved it...and i am happy to have it as part of our collection"
3,"Great for small stains, not for big ones","Bought this product based on Consumer Reports and because I have three little kids. At first I wasn't too impressed as I tried to remove chocolate ice cream stains from a shirt. I spent a 1/2 hour on one shirt and it only lightened the stains. After about 10 garments, I think Buzz works best on smaller, newer stains. It completely dissolved them. It had only limited success on large stains like dirt and chocolate spills (plus it may not be worth your time or the expense of the solution to treat them). It wasn't able to remove older set in stains. Also difficult to treat stains that are on thicker parts (hems, collars) of the garment where you can't get a stain catcher pad directly under the stain."
1,Worked Great on First Stain....Now It Doesn't Work At All,"Reliability seems to be a big issue with this product. After reading Consumer Reports, I bought one from Amazon. It removed the first grease stain completely, saving my $35 shirt. But when I tried to use it on a second stain, it stopped spraying the liquid.What a hassle! Seems like other reviewers are having the same experience. Yes, I know I can get it repaired. But I'm too busy to spend an hour packaging and sending it. This one goes in the trash!Too bad. Seems like it could be a great product."
3,"It works, but they keep failing","In general, we were happy with it, but... Both of my units have failed with the same problem. They stop pumping fluid. The red light is off, the pump makes noise, but nothing comes out. My second unit was a replacement because the first unit failed."
1,Useful only as a boat anchor,Tried this product on two stains. First tried it on an ink stain in a cotton-poly Lands End Shirt ($50). It only spread the stain. Second stain same problem. Am returning the product. On a scale of 1-10 it's a zero.
1,Piece of crap,"I was jealous of the reviewers that got it to work the first time, and then it stopped working. Ours does not work at all. It's hard to remove the ""seal"" from the fluid container, and even when we thought we had (still not sure), the red light remained on indicating that it was out of fluid. The sonic buzzy thing never buzzed.It doesn't seem like such a complicated thing to get right. It's just like a sonic toothbrush, but wiht a different attachment. Maybe a Sonicare would work better!"
1,How about zero stars?,"I got exactly two uses out of this piece of dung before the sprayer wouldn't spray and the ""buzz"" went bust. Hey, Black & Decker, ever hear of product testing? Apparently, I'm not the only one to have this problem. I've never encountered a product as unreliable."
1,A good product until it quits working,"Our first ""Buzz"" worked for perhaps two weeks before it stopped pumping fluid. During that time it met our expectations. Like others have mentioned, after calling for service we were told to cut off the cord and return the unit. Our replacement arrived and worked for a week before it quit buzzing.Bottom line: It would be a decent product if the quality was adequate, but judging from my experience and other reviews it has serious design or production flaws that result in a very high failure rate. Even if you like the way it works there is a good chance it will be broken in a week or two and nobody deserves that kind of frustration."
1,It sucks!,Other methods work faster and better. Stains that won't come out with other methods don't come out using the Tide Buzz stain removers. A huge waste of money.
1,"Great idea, bad implementation!","I read the directions, I got it to work. I didn't use the product for a while. Then, just like many others have said, when i went to use it again, no fluid would come out. (Don't listen to those who think that we who can't get it to work can't walk and chew gum... It's the product, plain and simple.) Whenit's working, it barely cleans stains, and it doesn't stay working for long at all. Thank heavens I only spent $25 total on the unit. It isn't worth $1.00..."
1,I'd be ashamed to sell Junk.,"I just opened my box up and attempted to use the product. An hour later it's packed up and ready to be returned. The device never got pumping and i had a constant red indicator light tell me i needed to replace the cleaning fluid. Yes, I did remove the blue tab before I put the cleaning cartridge in and I even read the directions more than once.The website that the manual refers to is no longer in existence and it looks like there is no support for this product anywhere.What a shame it is that such an iconic name for American quality continues to brand their own name on such junk!!! Black and Decker you should do the right thing and develop products that we Americans can trust again.This product is a waste of my time and my money - I'm hoping I can get a refund rather than a replacement.Stay far away from this device regardless of the price offered to you."
1,Worst consumer product ever made,"This ridiculous product will work once and then quit. The soap gets clogged or something in the tube and will not work again. You can send them back but they are just the same. Why this left the factory is beyond me.Even if they gave it away and just sold the soap, I would still throw it as far away as I could. Save your money."
3,i think it is my fault but no,"Sorry, I just did not enjoy this CD. I heard him on a Pandora link, and was intrigued. This CD is well structured, good writing, good background music, but his voice does not resonate in my brain. When I don't ""get"" an artist, I either toss the CD or I set it aside so that maybe after I evolve a bit, I will understand the music. This is the case for this one -- I am letting it stew a bit, and will come back to it before I make up my mind."
5,"An extremely interesting proposal, sure to be controversial","Hart begins by noting that we have gone from a country traditionally suspicious of standing professional armies to a situation that he describes as ""Eisenhower's Nightmare"" -- a military industrial complex so powerful that despite the end of the cold war it chugs on almost unabated. Hart's proposal is a military something like the Swiss model: universal service, with a very large force of part-time citizen soldiers backing up a professional military much smaller than at present. The proposal is interesting, but the most thought-provoking part of Hart's book is his critique of the current system, in which he concludes that maybe the Framers weren't crazy to fear a standing professional army, and that maybe we should too."
4,"A return to ""conservative"" military values for reform","In one of Mr. Hart's classic works on military reform he calls for a return to the militia form as the backbone of the US military as it once was. It is an idea not given nearly the attention it should have and this concise work provides a great starting point for anyone interested in real and meaningful military reform. Conservatives should take up the mantle and follow through but instead, sadly, they will probably continue to ignore Mr. Hart. This kind of reform is so often dismissed out of hand before it can be taken the least bit seriously. So we will continue down the path of ever greater government growth for a bloated and intervention-prone military. Sad, but Mr. Hart seems to be the modern day Cassandra providing prophetic and valuable insight that most ignore."
2,Forgets an important issue!,"An interesting work but losses sight of the current operational tempo of today's forces. It is the politicians, usually the President, who commit America's forces. By some accounts, the regular forces are deployed in over a hundred countries. Some commitments such as Korea and Bosnia are long lasting. That may be the real issue for our current force structure. Some studies already belive they are stretched thin. If the current policies continue, is it realistic to assume that the reserve forces, leaving jobs and families, can support the various deployments and obligations? Then again, maybe this plan would force a reassessment of today's military deployments."
4,Simple. Easy 2 understand,"Tho i'm in 9th, this chemistry book is quite understandable. The chemistry in action sections are nice, but it would be nice if they were explained. the solved problems after every key lesson are a nice touch, providing a good opportunity to check ur grasp of the concept."
3,"Three-and-a-half stars. McCalden's best, aside from his timely Newsletter of 1981-90. Several serious but small errors in here","But better than anything overratedGermar Rudolf, the plagerizer did!McCalden is one who's writings neverquite go away. For more on the pers-onality of Dave McCalden, who despitehis kooky athiest beliefs, I do like,see the very fine Bradley R. Smithbook, ""Break His Bones."" McCalden isawrong about Karl Marx (ne' Levy's)ethniocity. Marx hated the jews andeven wrote a book called 'A WorldWithout jews' before the CommunistManifesto. Marx was half ethnicallykhazar but half german as well. Atage 17 Marx wrote a poem about hislove of Jesus Christ. Then he wentoff to a secular college, startedreading athiest kook Nietsche'swritings and got brainwashed again-st the dominant faith in WesternCivilization and enbraced the kookytheory of Evolution. The rest, isunfortunately history!"
3,Going For A Different Sound,"What a difference a few years makes. On their last record, DD were a straight up nu-metal act with a crunchy, but sometimes dated sound. Blue In The Face sounds life a totally different band. This goes for almost their entire sound, save for the couple of moments, ""The Hand"" being on of them, where they re-live their harder edged days. Sometimes this change is good, as evidenced on the bluesy ""Freightrain."" And sometimes it's not, like the dopey sentiment of ""Imprint."" The AIC sound of the acoustic ""Big Shove"" suits the band well, as does the guitar wall of ""Hollowbody."" For the most part though, this is a very uneven record, showing a band in transition, with moderate success."
4,one to check out,"I am still trying to figure out how come these guys have yet to gain the recognition they deserve!! In an industry infested with talentless musicians, these guys really stand out. Blue in the face is as hard hitting as the first, only this time it has a more full sound due to better production. It seems to me like this may be some what of an experimental cd, there is a couple acustic sounding tracks along with other experimetal styles. 11:59, hollowbody,a million people, I guess every song is great. I don't really care for modern rock, but this album is one worth buying. Also check out 1000 yard stare, A 5 star album. Better yet, check them out live, you will not be disapointed."
5,Kicks!,"This cd rocls my world! Granted I liked the first cd, but this one stood up to the test of time!! Its great!"
3,Another weak choice,"When the name of the label means a lot it may get really risky to deal with not so known bands playing a softened type of the modern heavier music.Neither the band is that great, nor any track on the CD sounds really impressive, and considering the famous label, which is misleading in this case, this all creates a confusing picture for those who might have expected a little more than the average.While some tunes like Imprint, Evenout, and Inside Out are close to a better sound, overall the general impression may strangely be not so strongly positive.Good luck is what to be wished to both the band and the label, and a little more success for the next time."
2,Metal meets bubble gum pop,"And I thought Nickelback was getting too comercial. Their lack of originality makes this album unimpressive. This is what happens when Lance Bass meets Metallica.If you're looking for a better band in this genre (diet Metal) than try the band 'Ra', their album is 'From One'."
2,recommend purchasing the audio tape,Not the simple do-it-yourself book I had hoped for. The use ofsymbols in the book demands that you possess the audiotape for thiscourse.
3,"Title should be, ""The Old Testament and some archeology""","I am going to seminary and am reading this book as required for and archeology class. The book works from a chronological basis. Very readable, conservative, and generaly reliable information. Not much archeology! Mostly relates the Biblical narritive. Very weak on Jerico, Babylon, and Ur. Companion book by McRay is better by far!"
4,A clairified chronological review of the Old Testament,"Archaeology and the Old Testament is a fabulous compilation of events in the Old Testament for any newcommer to the study of Biblical Archaeology. It summarizes and places specific biblical events into the context of the period inwhich the event occured in a very ""Non-Biblical"" fashion (In otherwords - English!). A great book. However, some events are a little too summarized, and the reader is left with a few questions about what really happened. What is fantastic about this book is the way it brings together facts spread throughout the Old Testament and gives true relevance to the specific issue or event at hand (i.e., the story and history of Daniel!)"
5,Review of Hoerth's 'Archaeology and the Old Testament',"Wow, this covers everything. Hoerth presents a massive compendium of archaeological theory, discusses essentially every major piece of evidence, every remaining argument, and every recent consensus in the field. His writing considers internal and external evidence -- the Bible, but also archaeological tells. His writing is readable, and, occasionally, engaging. It is possible to compare this to Oxford's 'History of the Biblical World,' although Hoerth did this all by himself, and is more willing to discuss controversy."
4,A Different Perspective,"I don't usually read books of this genre (the protagonist is a young man who was raised on a farm in the South), and at first I thought I might not enjoy it. However, the more I read, the more I was caught up in the character and the story. A good vacation book--it's long, so you'll need plenty of time blocked out."
4,When All the World WWas Young,"My daughter read the book and enjoyed the book. Knowing I was a veteran of WWII, she recommended the book to me. There were many episodes in the book that I could relate to. For example, our unit landed in France about 10 days after the episode in the book. We bivouaced in a field in Normandy in the rain as did the book. I relived some things I did some 65 years ago when I was in the Army. Very enjoyable reading."
2,ideas not fully formed,"to my dissapointment, not everything by the original daevid allen era gong is indispensable. this is radio gnome invisible pt. 1 with the finest space rock lineup anyone could hope for but the final result of this album comes of sounding like a tentative rehearsal where in many places allen scats some of the songs' improvisations and their arrangement lacks coherence and development. instrumentation is limited to supporting the vocals and chants and rarely gets the opportunity to expound any ideas or feel each other out. in the end, daevid allen displays some infectious song writing ability but it appears that the new members just weren't ready to record yet. this is steve hillage's first appearance for gong but you wouldn't know it as his guitar is barely noticeable. things change remarkably for the next albums 'angels egg' and 'you' which are two of the greatest psychedelic albums ever recorded."
5,Their best,"Gongs best album is this one. The beginning of the flying teapot. If you never did drugs, you won't like this."
2,Comically bad when not seriously good,"2 1/2There are stretches of impressively fused, powerful psychedelic-progressive clarity to found in the dated, druggy-hippie treasure trove of a trilogy the band started with here, but too much in retrospect just falls into a lo-fi stew of silliness."
4,Gong Flying Teapot,"Gong is just a weird as I remember, discovered them in high school (was too many years ago) and they are still fun to listen to."
4,A soundtrack for the end of the world.,"On this album, Gegard Hourbette, Patricia Dallio and about 50 sessional musicans (without Thierry). They replay Haxan music (exactly ""Glissements progressifs du plaisir"" track), which was written by Hourbette.uBIQUe consists in two parts, and both are written by Hourbette.If you love Haxan album, this shall be good album for you.This is live recording, record quality is on high level.Extremely dark and obscure music."
2,Gong - 'The Flying Teapot' (JVC) 2 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1973,looks to be Gong's fifth lp that was produced by Giorgio Gomelsky(Yardbirds,Brian Auger).Call me ignorant if you wish,but for some reason(s)I've just never been able to get THAT much into this classic Gong catalog title.I do like the other two lp's they put out in the same two year period,'Angel Egg' and 'You' very much so.This CD reissue's title 12-minute cut,""Flying Teapot"" and ""Zero The Hero And The Witch's Spell"" are probably the best tracks here.So-so '70's cosmic rock.Nice reissue job on this Japanese label.Memorable cover."
4,Excellent,"This may be the best of the albums from Gong, the band Daevid Allen formed after leaving Soft Machine.Flying Teapot is, aptly, known as a space rock album, but this only half right: Teapot contains jazz, East Europian shadings, all kinds of music which the space thread runs through.This is fantastic, polished, sophiticated music, made by one of the 1970s undergrounds best bands."
5,Great Book,"This is one of the best general examinations of ancient Greek civilization I have ever seen for young people. It's chocked full of useful and fasinating information about both the history and lives of the Greeks, and it also tells a lot about how modern scholars learn about these facts. All high school classes that cover ancient culures should be using this book."
4,very good,"I've read 5 or 6 Richard Laymon books, and this is definitely my favorite. I wasn't able to put it down until I finished it. If you've enjoyed any of his other books, I highly recommend reading this one as well."
2,BIGGEST LAYMON DISAPOINTMENT THUS FAR....,"This takes the ticket for the worst laymon book i've ever read. The best part being the voyage from england to america, the rest of the book is a chore to the core. I hated all the characters and the western scenerio had me bored to death. This theme is very different from the rest of laymons books. I had high hopes since this book has many fans but it just didn't cut it for me, i put it down many times which almost never happens while i'm reading laymon. 2 Stars"
1,So bad,"Over the long Labor Day weekend, I treated myself with a trip to my local book store to buy a few books to help get me in the mood for Halloween--even thought it is rather a way off. The first few chapters of Savage were quite good, but once as soon as the characters set sail for America, I became very disappointed with the plot and the writing. Laymon's attempt at capturing a British accent is painful--He seems to rely heavily on words like ""bully"" and ""passel"" to convey Englishness. Similar painful methods are deployed in his use of words like ""pardner"" in his cowboy characters. There are pages of dialogue that were so bad that I read them out loud to a friend--our sides are still aching from the laugh workout.Having spent good money on the book, I finished it, but I was thrilled when I had read the last lines. I then walked the book down to my local thrift store and tossed it in a bin for some other poor soul to find. Buyer beware!!"
5,Wonderful!,"I know some reviewers seemed to think the twists rather cliched, but I absolutely loved this! Maybe I just don't read enough fantasy or perhaps I'm one of those ""younger kids"" that were mentioned, but either way I really truly loved it! I normally have trouble finishing short story collections all the way to the end, (it's just something about jumping from story-to-story all the time) so it's really saying something about a book whenever I do!!"
3,a mixed bag,"With a couple of exceptions, this group of darkly philosophical fantasy stories is thought-provoking but not suitable for younger/more sensitive readers. Veteran fantasy lovers are likely to find the twists a bit too predictable, while Coville's extremely low-key tone (obviously chosen to play up the ""surprise"" elements) can get really wearing. Check the book out at the library, read ""Homeward Bound"" and ""Blaze of Glory"" (which are very much worth your time and pack a surprising and beautiful punch), and let the rest go."
5,A Great Addition for a Superb System of Joining Wooden Parts,"Boxes, boxes, where are all the boxes I have? This compartmented case makes it easy to have the right Kreg screw sizes at hand."
4,Makes it worth living,"Aristotle said ""the unexamined life is not worth living."" Deena Metzger provides effective and fun tools for examining one's life. I know that my life is awesome!"
3,not as authentic as I thought,"I was looking for something with a genuine native sound to it, this has native elements but sounds much more ""mass produced"", don't know how else to describe it. I love the really spiritual native american music and this wasn't what I was looking for."
5,Unbelieveable,"This book is right to the point. The information given in the book and concerns are mentioned are exactly I see in my life and I have to fix. When I read this book I feel it speaks to my heart rather than my mind. Its approach (Cognitive therapy) is greatI could not bail out yet. But, I don't think there will be any better book for this subject in the market.Note: If you are uncertain that you need to bail out or not, readToo Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay: A Step-by-Step Guide to Help You Decide Whether to Stay In or Get Out of Your Relationshipfirst."
4,Good Pirate Flag,"I wanted a cheap pirate flag that looked decent. I got exactly what I wanted. The fabric is very thin and I don't know how sturdy it would be in strong winds, but for the price I can't complain. I give it 4 fo 5 stAAARRRs."
5,AHOY!,"YEARGH, finally i have the flag i needed to hoist upon my vessel so i may be the terror of the seas that i was meant to be. Warning: crew and ship not included."
4,Good for the price,"It is definitely good for the price I paid for it. I did read the size but wasnt thinking how big it actually was, originally was going to put it outside for the treehouse but it might be too big, so for now it's just sitting in storage. A little thin but I think it would hold up well enough."
4,Not bad for the money,"I orderd 1 thinking it was going to be crap, but when I got it wow not bad for the price, so I got 2 more and I will fly one on my RV when I go camping,the other I will fly off my Rhino when I go duning at Glamis. The light weight material will make it fly with just a small breeze, the 3x5 is large enough to be seem from all around. I just might get some more and just hand them out at camp for all of us to fly and have some fun. Heck who say's you can't be a pirate on the high sands LOL."
3,Pretty good flag but not as quality as the other one I bought,"I bought three flags. This black Jolly Roger one from this company and two red ones from another company. The flag from the other company was a better quality and just as cheaply priced. This flag is a very thin nylon. The other flag was a very thick durable material with stronger grommits. If I had not purchased the other flag, I would have been happy with this one, but because I DID get the other one, I know the quality can be MUCH better for the same low price. The other flag was purchased thru Amazon from the Pirate Heads company. Check my other reviews to see the other flag."
1,Worthless product...sent it back!,I was shocked at how awful these were! I ended up forming all of the dumplings by hand because these did such a poor job. The plastic outer circle cut through the dough with each press while the crimping part did not crimp it. I was left each time with maimed dumplings that wouldn't even hold together until I pressed them by hand. Don't waste your money!
1,"Bad product, cheap and useless otherwise you can call it trash","I purchased this product after I red the reviews that make it great and have 5 stars, try to use it found it not comfortable to HandelAnd when you press to seal the dough it cuts the pastry dough instead seal the edge of the dough,I will not recommend it, use forkTo press the edge of the empanad dough much better than that junco."
3,not for emapanadas,I use pre cut empanada dough so these presses were too small to use for them. I use them for making ravioli now. I don't think I really needed it.
5,"So far, so good","I have only used these twice, but so far I am pleased with them. They are easy to use and the variety of sizes are good for many things. I received them when promised."
2,Dough Presses not as easy as it looks,"Used the dough press to cut out my pie circle, but then the dough stuck to the surface of the press when I tried to remove it after filling.... I tried using a small amount of butter on it - which helped some -- but still not quite as easy as it looks!"
3,good big size,Good big size dough press but the small one is too small for me to use on anything worth pressing
1,Too small,These are just too small to be of any use. Just as easy to make Chinese dumpling without press - don't waste your money.I purchased the 'CALZONE MAKER MOLD' for calzone - works great.
4,Go To Winter Lure,This lure is the go to wintertime lure in deep lakes. Its a fish catcher for sure. Be careful if you use this around structure as its very easily snagged.
5,I love it.,Before the next tear drop fall what a song that will make u cry cause it sound so good.Kind of sound like Johnnie Taylor when he said ilove u i love u i kove u n i'm changing.ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok.
5,Freddy,"great voice, good to hear his wonderful voice. I saw in in concert once and he has got better with age"
3,Good starting point for investors exploring 1031 Exchanges.,This book offers a basic introduction to tax-deferred exchanges in a simple format. Readers could benefit from more relevant examples; for example focusing far less on barter-for-property and more on resources and likely issues with a delayed exchange.
