2,Boring disapointment,"I really got into the first 4 books, and could hardly put them down. It seemed like the author was just trying to get the most out of her series though after the 4th book and it really should have ended at book 5. The last few books in the series were so hard to read and keep up with I found myself drifting more often than not, but I am one of those people that cannot stand to leave a book unfinished. I was actually relived when the series ended and I finally could get started on another book. I am a speed reader, and the last three books took me a month and a half to read alone...it has NEVER taken me that long to get through 3 books!"
3,Different Odor I used to smell,I remember a long time ago this perfume have stronger odor. A good one.This version is OK. I really expect more. Still I like it
1,Keep looking.. this is not the book you need..,"..if you really want to learn how to work a room. The book is written for women who are shy. Even if that describes you, there are better books to read. Most of the book addresses the issues of how to shake hands, how not to wear see-through blouses, and how to avoid having sex at trade shows. Unless these are burning issues for you, you will find nothing of value in this book. I am a professional consultant and attend conferences and networking events several times per month. I bought the book in an airport, read the first half, skimmed the second half and left it on the plane for the next person. It was a waste of an hour and a half and [my money]. Save yourself the time and expense, unless you are a 22 year female college grad in her first sales job who needs instruction on who to flirt without getting in over your head and need to be told that you shouldn't have sex at trade shows."
2,How to waste money and make this autor rich,"Book tells you what you should be doing but it doesn't tell you HOW, which is what the author promises to do. I felt this book might be good for people who have absolutely no experience with self help books or self improvement but for anyone else it's just fluff. It provides very few examples. All the material could have been nicely summarized in a pamphlet."
2,"Good topic, poor execution","How to work a room. What a great concept for a book. Unfortunately the book barely delivers. While there were a few good suggestions, this book was too basic and offered little except some common sense ideas. The author seemed more at home talking about how women can meet men than the real art of working a room.In summary great title, very poor execution. I would say more but this book offers very little to respond to."
3,"This book is really intended for women, not men","How to Work a Room is a reasonably good book, but I think women will get a whole lot more out of it than men will. I, as a man, was not terribly interested in worrying about being hit on by my co-workers (""The Intercepted Pass"") or dressing in a business appropriate fashion. There are good points for both men and women, but these can also be found in other materials."
3,Pity that Hollywood has done so little with the Pilgrims,"""Plymouth Adventure"" is just about the only Pilgrim movie I can think of (I'm not counting the various ""Scarlet Letter""s and Salem Witch movies--those are about Puritans already settled in the New Land, not the Pilgrims just coming over). It's not really a bad movie, but it's not really a good one either. Stellar cast: Spencer Tracy as Capt Jones, not really into the Pilgrims' scene, but just doing his job; Leo Genn as William Bradford, intent on leading his followers to religious freedom; Gene Tierney as his wife, devoted to her husband but feeling stirrings for Jones. Van Johnson's on board too as ""Speak for Yourself John"" Alden. Sad ending actually a slight twist on real life fate of one of the principals. Perhaps a good starting point for a history lesson with the children on Thanksgiving Day."
4,"Dramatized Account of Voyage, Good Detail.","Fairly good dramatic account of the voyage itself. Attention to physical detail on board the ship and the rigors of life under sail. Costumes are accurate. The tensions between the pilgrams and the ship's company is handled with considerable creative license. The story ends with the Mayflower's return to England and there is no account of how the passengers fared in the New World (half of them died the next year). A reasonably good account of the trip itself, which was miserable, wet and cold."
2,NOT 1952'S BEST PICTURE,"With all respect to the other reviewer, this movie did not win the Oscar for Best Picture of 1952. (I believe it was ""The Greatest Show on Earth""). Unfortunately ""Plymouth Adventure"" is one of those movies that has a talented cast which just can't overcome a mediocre script. Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson's half-hearted attempts at English accents are laughable at times. But, on the positive side, any movie with Gene Tierney in it is bound to be nice to look at (though being a Puritan her attire is appropriately modest). And the Mayflower itself looks good. But the film really has no depth. It's a shame the actors, particularly Tracy, weren't better served."
5,Plymouth Adventure,This is a true must see for Thanksgiving. It has great characters and is very realistic. Love it! It is a great educational video for your children to watch.
5,Family Portrait,John Alden and Pricilla Mullins were my 9th Great Grand father and 9th Great Grand mother. Great to see how they met.
5,Edward Said: Master of Race Card Academic Mischief,"The late Edward Said often intimidated his critics with the false charge of racism. He more then hinted that only those who perceived dark skinned people to be inferior might possibly disagree with his conclusions. Ibn Warraq brilliantly shows him to have been an intellectually shallow and not altogether honest writer. At the very best, to be blunt, Said was a second rate mediocrity. He took full advantage, however, of the politically correct cultural zeitgeist dominating our so-called best universities. It is also very fair to accuse Said of slandering great scholars merely for being white skinned Westerners. The author takes him to task in a very careful and detailed manner. This book is not in any way a cheap shot attack on the memory of Edward Said. I dare anyone to find even one substantial mistake in the entire book."
1,"""Ibn Warraq"" Misses the Point","One of the main points of Said's book is that this thing that we refer to as ""The West"" is something that we have created for our own purposes; it is a concept that does not take into account the many differences within the so-called West (nor the many similiarities between ""East"" and ""West""). There are certainly aspects of Said's work that can be criticized--but in a productive way that furthers our understanding of human cultures and the last few hundred years of history (many authors, such as James Clifford, Lisa Lowe and others have carried out such critiques). But ""Ibn Warraq"" completely misses the point and for this reason just reminds us of the need for Said's work to be heeded."
1,Baseless Argument,This author's work simply conveys his own biased view of Islam and the Arabic World. Don't waste your time reading this. I dropped the book after few pages. The author is extremely biased.
2,Not what i expected,Not alot of reading goes into this book. Alot of beautiful pictures with what seem like exerpts from his poetry. Didnt love it. But I do like it.
4,Lovely Book,"I first read this book when staying at our timeshare condo and it was on the coffee table. Robert Frost is my favorite poet and we vacation in Vermont and other areas of New England, so it is a great addition to my coffee table collection. Got it used for a great low price!"
4,French for my grandchild,"My son and daughter-in-law requested this book.. It seems like a cute way to introduce the baby to a bit of French. The paper version might not hold up as well as a cardboard version, but the book is very colorful and contains complete sentences, which might give a better sense of language than just vocabulary. We still haven't read the book to our 2week old, so I don't know what my final recommendation will be. However, it does look promising."
2,It was OK,"I have read much better. The concept drew me in but by the end I was ready to be done with it. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great."
1,another dissatisfied customer,"(...)not send your kids to Kumon. It is the brain school and all you do is work on trivial worksheets that do not enhance your knowledge at all. It just makes you a work-a-holic, and teaches stuff by reptition. If you want a life, don't go because like my asian friends, you will not get out of it as long as your parents control you. I went there for a few days, it sucked and i did nohing but eat their goldfish snacks. yes her son got 1600, but still. Kumon is...brainwash"
1,Outdated information,"The book probably would have been a little useful had I been reading it 10 years ago. Most of the ""facts"" are incorrect and it speaks of the program as if it just got to the US. There is way more information on the internet about Kumon than this book offers. It really is basic stuff that the instructor tells you."
1,circuitous info,"This is what you call blowing your own horn...! The book doesn't even feature sample worksheets so you would have an idea how they look or how they might work. The information you'll get is circuitous and redundant; they have nothing new to say after the 20th page. It's also a wonder: If the Kumon method is a proven effective oriental way of learning math, how come there are very few Kumon centers in Japan's equally-oriental neighbors China and Korea? It's true: Kumon is not so welcome in these two countries."
3,"Compact, but dull and outdated","This books touch a little bit on many topics in embedded system. This may be good to absolute beginner who want to have quick look into the embedded world. However, as many other books, it provides no useful and practical information to non-beginner.This book seemed to be so outdated, not only the processors, but also the diagram, sample code text. I hardly believe its 1st Edition was in 1997, more unbelievable, this Edition was 2002. Even if the author doesnt update the content of his book, well, I think at least he should get someone to re-arrange and re-type it to make it looks nicer."
1,don't waste your time....,"there are thousands of ""self-help"" books out there and the author certainly wanted to get a chunk of that billion dollar industry. He probably asked himself what he could write about until he heard about the famous marshmallow experiment that took place in the 60s... the result is an insipid, boring and useless ""khalil Gibran""-style book, presented as a condescending fictional lecture given by know-it-all billionaire to his stupid driver... a ""lesson"" that could have been summed up in 2 paragraphs and could have wasted less of my time...Here's a free self-help lesson: don't buy it!"
5,Don't Eat The Marshmallow...Yet! : The Secret to Sweet Success in Work and Life,"I had the pleasure of listening to Mr. Joachim De Posada speak at a convention in West Palm Beach. I loved his enthusiastic presentation and took interest in his book. After reading this book (it only took about one hour), I gave it to my children and my niece, who are young adults and are spending more than they are making.I was pleasantly surprised how receptive they were and have already implemented some of Mr. De Posada's ideas about ""delaying gratification"" and saving for the future.This book is very easy to read, and should be required reading in economics and given to every teenager and young adult by their parents."
1,DIDN'T LIKE THE PARABLE STYLE OF THIS BOOK,"I had read a short part of this book on-line before purchasing it and was eagerly waiting for it's arrival. However, once I began reading it further and realized it was more of a ""story"", I instantly regretted buying this book. I guess other people may appreciate the parable way of writing but if you are like me and want more facts and helpful information rather than a stories as examples of how to apply the ""Don't eat the marshallmallow"" method, you will want to skip this book. A disappointment for me."
5,Wonderful Beautiful Children's Story Book!!,"I just loved this book and so did my children. The illustrations are beautiful and colorful, the story is imaginative and fanciful (which is lacking in so many other children's books these days).This book is a must have for any young child!!!!"
4,if anything ever goes wrong at the zoo,"I bought this for my three grandaughters, age 3 and twins age 2. I like to buy books that reflect their experiences, and I gave them this after a trip to the zoo--they enjoyed it. Cute story and attractive illustration."
5,My daughter's favorite book,"My daughter is 4 and she loves this book. We read it every night and she can tell us the story just by looking at the pictures. We buy this book for everyone, it's excellent."
5,Yes!,"This is one of the bests books I have ever read. It is essentially a systematic theology usuing the same format as Calvin's Institute's, or Charles Hodge or Louis Berkhof, but it is so much more accessable to modern readers, especially lay-people. It is precise and Biblical, without wondering from the main line of thought. Very, very good."
4,Good theology overview,"This book contains three volumes, each of which consists of chapters which are transcripts of talks given by Martyn Lloyd-Jones. Reading through the entire book (which took me about 8 months) gives a great overview of all the key topics in theology, including explanations of where we find these doctrines in the scriptures, and how they are applicable to our lives. Lloyd-Jones is careful to give multiple interpretations where there has been significant debate. He writes from and advocates a classic evangelical Christian perspective. Overall, it is readable, understandable, and does not demand a lot of background knowledge. It is a long read, but well worth the effort."
1,A Piece of Crap,"I purchased this item and took it on a long summer vacation with me. I plugged in the charger and charged the batteries for a good 8 hours or so, but the batteries did not charge one bit. Completely dead. I tried the same batteries in my Fuji charger i normally use; they wouldn't charge. I tried different batteries in the Suncrap charger; wouldn't charge.Same your time and money and don't buy this crap. Stick to well known brands with good reviews."
5,excellent source fair price,"Despite a promise of delivery in about 12 days, the product arrived in less than half that time. Perfect timing since we were leaving for a trip."
1,"""Truth"" according to who?","Well if you can believe that humans are actually the descendants of aliens which ""immigrated"" to the Earth millions of years ago from Venus and elsewhere, or that Jesus Christ is actually an incarnation of a Buddhist god known as Amor, or that Atlantis (and several other previous ""civilizations"") existed, or that some hot-shot career track businessman (the author) is actually a reincarnation of Gautama Siddhartha, then this is the book for you! If the author had stuck to his philosophy of Buddhist self-help, the reader might find a few nuggets of wisdom. But as it is, I kept reading just to find out what outrageous thing he was going to write next. Fortunately, this was a gift. Unfortunately, I now have to tell the giver what I really thought of it. ""Sorry, luv, it [was bad]."""
1,"Dear lord, make it stop!","I've heard good things about Saga for a while now, and after reading a review for Pain of Salvation's ""The Perfect Element"", in which one reviewer compared the singer to Daniel Gildenlow, I was especially intrigued.Wow. This is quite unpleasant. Horribly cheesy, overwrought, and just plain embarrassing. And to say that Gildenlow has ripped this guy off in any way is just plain wrong. For one thing, they sound nothing alike, and second, Gildenlow is about a thousand times better, with a much smoother tone, way more versatility, and much much less cheese.Prog took a really nasty turn for the worst in the 80's, and this is a prime example. Go buy ""The Perfect Element"". It's a masterpiece. To say that any part of it is even remotely ripped off from this tripe is an insult of the highest degree."
2,Music For an Era Gone By,"I owned this cassette shortly after its original release and loved it. Now my cassette collection is long gone, and I was recently surprised to learn that Saga is still around and recording.I wanted to reconnect with their music, so I bought Silent Night on CD. Sadly, it was a big let down.Saga is (or at least was) largely a keyboard/synth band much in the Styx mold. And while I don't deny that both bands produced some good music (maybe even great music) in their day, that day is long gone, and in my view their music does not stand the test of time.I understand Saga is about to release a DVD, and I had gone as far as to preorder it on Amazon.com. But after revisiting their music, I no longer have the desire to hear them, let alone see a bunch of aging musicians. I've cancelled that order."
5,THE BEST RECORD OF THE 80'S,"This record was THE RECORD for a whole generation of 'rockers'in my country. The SAGA MANIA broke all records and it all started with the song ""dont be late""..."
1,So not worth it,This was not what I expected at all. First of all it had to have been made in the late 80's or early 90's. The sound quality was horrible. There was a buzz throughout that was very distracting. There were a couple of points I could use for looking at portrait problems but truly this was not worth my time to watch. The majority of the film was painting backgrounds and I am not interested in that so i just skipped it. Very disappointed.
1,Very boring video,"This was soooo boring.... I was expecting something totally different, and learn some to take portrait pictures. There was A LOT of time spent in showing how to paint backgrounds...For me it was a complete waste of money...sorry.."
1,what a ripoff,u can buy the game eq with 10 expansions for 17.00 right now on ebay this guy has to get real
3,The Fly,"Preferred the songs he did on ""Woman on Top"" sound track. Songs were too strained rather than cool and laid back."
2,Inexpensive and ineffective,"If you have short medium to thin hair this is probably a good product. If you have longish or thick hair, the bristles are not strong enough to penetrate the hair thickness and reach the scalp. Good to carry around in one's handbag or car I suppose."
5,Hands down no competition,"The writers editors who ever had input in this study bible did their homework. Man they have a break down of every book in the bible. Maps, words of Christ in red, interesting topics for verses i.e Isa 44:6 talks about the Lord being King...it will name a topic they have in the back of the book under a number like God King 3465 and you find it and it gives you scripture, it's too much to type JUST GET THIS BIBLE. Of course the reference scriptures. They even break down different translations of bibles i.e kjv esv niv, and tell you a little bit about why the translation came about and why. Its awesome and so simple."
5,great reference Bible,"highly recommend, can't beat the price (I almost bought an almost identical book for almost 2x as much at Borders).won't regret the purchase."
5,Amazing book,Bought this book for my wife at first she couldn't understand how to use the Thompson chain but after she keep trying finally she got it. This book is for people that desire to know about the lots in a deeper way. Get this book and study for yourself. There are a lot of wolf in sheep clothing our there. Know the word yourself so you will not be deceive amen
5,Good buy,"Good buy. Bought it for a client who had become interested in the Christian faith and did the NKJV because that was nearer to the Bible translation he had. I find topics are useful (look up anxiety, etc.). Thompson topics are more self-evident. Also, helps on historical context have been updated and are pretty good. Outline of books are workable. All in all, a wealth of information under one cover. The chain reference means in reading a passage various topics are in the margin and can be followed either by going through the Bible text by text or by referring to a file number in the back. Many have the scriptures grouped together under the file number. Going through the ""chain"" text by text means it is easy to see the context of the scripture referred to. An excellent tool. Also available in NIV (I believe, at least I have one)."
1,"Bad Vendor, don't trust! Living Waters Christian Book Store!","Absolutely nothing from the order I placed, and I'm days past the final date for shipmnet. No return emails to my requests for information concerning this and never even a shipment tracking # to this date. Stay away..."
2,Boring with lots of typos!,"After reading Anthony's ""Scar Tissue"" it's really tough for any other book on rock music to hold up. I thought I'd read ""Velvet Groove"" to get an outsider's perspective. Very early on in the book I started noticing typos, at least one in every chapter. After awhile it's kind of insulting to the reader. Even the name of the BAND was misspelled once as the Red Hit Chili Peppers (and no it wasn't an intentional thing implying that they had lot's of ""hits""). If the book was compelling I could overlook the typos and bad grammar, but this one is really a yawn-fest that is only interesting when interview quotes from Rolling Stone magazine are provided.In the author's bio it states that ""Roach has written over 80 titles and many biographies of rock bands"" (I am paraphrasing) It is my opinion that this writer should focus more on quality than quantity and for God's sake hire a proof reader!"
2,I AGREE DUDE UPSTAIRS,"NOT A CHILD DIP STICKSI AGREE w/ THE GUY ABOVE. I STOPED READING IN THE MIDDLE, PLEASE DONT BUY!"
2,Parrot book,"Although a useful book on parrot illnesses, it was a great shame and disappointment that the book was all in black and white. there were no colour pictures or photographs. once again a real disappointment!"
3,Nice but not so nice.,"They appear nice at first, but when you install them, the inside flaps dont lay flat on either side. I ended up ordering a different brand because i wasnt really happy with these."
5,The Truth is revealed with fiction.,"Every American that cares about our Democracy needs to understand what is behind the Independent Counsel's investigation of our President. The Star Chamber helped me put the investigation in the proper perspective. This ""Insider's Account"", while written as fiction, rings true and places people and events in an understandable, and believable, context."
5,Excellent performance and transcriptions,"The Suite Compostelana is a staple for concert guitarists, and here receives a beautifully shaded and shaped performance. The real treats are the guitarist's own transcriptions of Mompou's atmospheric and translucent piano miniatures, many of which I'm guessing may only be known to connoiseurs. This is fine playing, very well recorded and generous at nearly 80 minutes."
5,Extremely Happy,I purchased this scanner based on the reviews of the previous models. I've been very happy with the results. I've tried flatbed scanners and they don't come close to the clarity this one provides. It is time consuming and the Silverfast software is not for beginners but the results are worth all of the time and effort
4,Very sound product,"This is a great product. I had no experience with converting slides to digital. I just wanted a machine that would do this job as easily as possible. While some aspects are not easy, it is reliable and gives outstanding quality. Biggest weakness: The software - particularly the instructions. Eg: Even though there is both written and video help available for scratch and dust removal, I have yet to get it to work as designed despite many hours of labor. I am not a computer neophyte and consider myself above average as a computer user.But the scanner itself duplicates the slide - even improves it demonstrably, and I am very happy I purchased the machine. Plan on an average of 2 minutes/slide at 300dpi and 4x6 inch copies, not counting defect removal. Lower resolutions or smaller copies will mean faster times."
1,Displeased by the quality,I have been using the CanonScan 8600F flatbed scanner with fantastic results but was hoping to get a specialized negative scanner. Upon receiving this device I tried it out and was disappointed to say that the quality of its scans were vastly inferior to a basic flatbed scanner. Save your money and go with the flexibility of a flatbed. Occasionally cleaning the glass is a small price to pay for the quality.
2,Sadly disappointed,"The scratch and dust removal feature worked when I first got the scanner, but began to malfunction after a few weeks into use. I tried to contact Plustek who promises a 24 hour response. I've made three attempts to obtain help, and never heard a word from them. The price would be good for a working device, but its way much money for something that's not functional and a company that won't support their product."
5,Perfect gift for anyone who loves Emily!,I gave this as a gift for a friend who loves Emily Dickinson and she was absolutely thrilled. The pictures are great and the setup really nice. It is quite a wonderful book!
1,Product description isn't correct for the item.,This is not for a 98-2002 Amigo. The directions that came with the top is for a 89-94 Amigo. Do not buy if you have a 94 or lower. I have a 98 and this does not fit. Took a month for me to get it and it is the wrong one.
5,Plant dolly,We use this on a large lemon tree so we can roll it outside in summer and back inside in winter. This dolly is very sturdy and is better than I expected.
4,Love the wubbanub!,"I'm not a huge fan of soothie pacifier/nipples because they don't seem good for the mouth, but a nurse I am acquainted with told me about how they are used in the NICU so I got the frog one for my daughter... it's so cute! she loved to hold it while in her bouncer and kept her company. Now I got the giraffe awaiting my son's arrival, I can't wait to introduce it to him! :)"
5,WubbaNubs... a MUST HAVE for new Moms!,"I bought my daughter her first WubbaNub, the frog, before she was even born because I had read such wonderful things about them and I was very happy I did as she LOVES her Wubbas! Honestly I had wasted much money on other pacifiers because now at 2 months old these are all she'll take. She has the frog and the giraffe which are both so cute and functional. She is able to hold on to the hands of the animal (esp. with the frog) or the head and keep it in her mouth MUCH easier than a regular paci and like other parents have said they're WAY easier to find. Everywhere we go everyone wants to know where we got the adorable pacifiers."
5,My baby loves this paci!,"My baby loves this pacifier! He has a giraffe one as well and it really helps him to get the paci in his mouth, especially in the car. The animal helped the paci stay in his mouth when he was younger. There was a small hole in the leg seam and I sewed it up myself, but to me that's no big deal (The giraffe one was fine), you would just want to keep an eye out for it so your baby does not eat stuffing!I've seen people sew their own beany babies to the Soothie pacifiers but they use the breathing holes to do it and I wasn't comfortable with that.If you are breastfeeding you should know that the Avent Soothie paci that is attached to the animal is the best kind of paci to use so as to avoid nipple confusion or preference for the other type of paci. I started using an Avent Soothie early--before it's recommended to do so, like 2 weeks--and my baby has had no problem breastfeeding or using a paci."
2,not old enough,"I bought this product in hopes that my son wouldn't wake up during the night searching for his pacifier, but unfortunately he still does. I think he is still too young to hold onto his little Wubbanub frog. He is 4 1/2 months and still prefers his old pacifier. But I will definitely try again in a month or so."
3,Cool concept,"The wubbanub is a pretty cool concept. I had been looking all over for ideas to help my son keep his pacifier in his mouth when I came across the wubbanub. It sounded great, so I ordered one, and was thrilled when it came in. My son first got the soothie pacifier while in the hospital, and for a while that was the only one he would even take, though we've recently gotten him to take others also, so I didn't think anything of this one. I think the wubbanub would work great for younger babies, but I didn't get mine until my son was 2 months old. By that time I think he squirms so much while trying to go to sleep that it doesn't do any good. I also think that if the stuffed animals were of beanbag weight, they would stay a little better. For a brand new baby, I think this is a great idea, for a baby a little older don't waste your money."
5,Expensive for a paci but worth it!,"My dog chewed up the wubbanub that I received at my baby shower the first day I gave it to my son so I didn't really understand the full benefits of these until I bought this one. Well, it's AWESOME! The cute stuffed animal really helps the paci stay in place. I give it to my son when he's in the swing for his naps (not at night...too freaked out about SIDS and don't want anything around his face!). He loves this one. Also, it's great for when he's a little older (currently 4 weeks) b/c he'll be able to hold onto the little frog. I'd definitely recommend this to any new mom or dad that is giving their little one a paci and having issues with it always popping out of their baby's mouth!"
4,Wubbanub Pacifier is GREAT!!,"My 2 1/2 month old son loves his frog wubbanub. It's wonderful! Before I bought this he was never interested in pacifiers but now he loves it. The wubbanub is the only pacifier I can get him to take, I even have the soothie pacifiers by themselves and he won't take them. This is also great at bedtime, I put the pacifier in his mouth and tuck the animal under the covers and it keeps it right in his mouth making bedtime a breeze. I just wish they would make the pacifier detachable from the stuffed animal, it's hard to clean."
3,Weird taste and smell,"I am not sure if I just got a bad apple, but when my pacifier came I opened the bag and it smelled weird - like rubber on a tire. The pacifier also tasted like you were sucking on a tire and my 4 month old was not impressed. I think it's a great idea to have the frog attached to the paci and my baby likes to play with the frog but the pacifier tastes weird to him and he won't touch that."
4,Good Buy,"It goes into enough detail for the P38 or P1 owner with some info on the P4 and other models. I expect from this type of book a list of dates of manufacture per serial number if they were indeed serial (post war manufacture was) which is why it's shy a star. Otherwise, a book, should you own the gun, you'll want in your collection."
5,Super-cali-fragilistic-monkey-droppin-go-ballistic!,"First heard these guys on the ""Snatch"" (Snatch (Widescreen Edition)) soundtrack, finally tracked the lone album release down in a used CD store the other day. Great album, featuring sounds that range from hyper-kinetic synth / guitar raves to a 26-minute ambient track with psychological weather forecasts and an interminable busy signal. After a mid-tempo bass rolling opener with ""Slayed"", DJ Overseer jumps into higher gear through the deliciously gritty ""Stompbox"" and ""Supermoves"". Other highlights include the rainy day moodiness of ""Sparks"" and the rap-core vs gorgeously vulnerable chick tradeoffs of ""Never"". ""Basstrap"" channels Fatboy Slim, slapping your head side to side with a mantra you'll be chanting at your desk.Good stuff, drop it in the mix and see what you think."
2,5 stars if remixed without vocals.,"I don't know that much about the vast arena of all things techno, but I do love THE CRYSTAL METHOD's VEGAS because all but one track is really cool electronic music sans vocalists. VEGAS turned me onto electronic music (my primary passion is guitar driven alternative) and I hurried to buy the follow up, TWEAKEND, to be dissapointed at the numerous tracks that featured singing. Hard pumping techno is better appreciated without those pesky guest vocalists. This is why I didn't enjoy WRECKAGE. The music is superb, cool pulsing beats with a soundscape of electronic bells and whistles that sounds refreshingly cool. Unfortunately, only two songs on the disc are void of full on vocal tracks (tracks 3 and 4). These two tracks rock but that's it. The rest of the CD has excellent mixes but they are mired by the singing. I just think the music speaks for itself and would be better served alone. Any techno that needs to add unnessesary singing is indeed wrecked."
4,The variety is the best part,"Ok, so this group isn't well known and maybe it is because every time a track changes it sounds like a new group. BUT it means they are versitile. I hate CD's that sound the same through the whole album. This definitely isn't like that. Just when you get into one or two grooves, it changes and sounds totally different. That versatility, to me, speaks of talent. This is one CD my very underground influenced boyfriend and my music degree trained self can both agree on."
5,Simply refreshing.,"I've wondered for a while why Faye was so popular, and then I heard this. ^_^ Her voice is beautiful, dynamic, so light and flimsy and yet exploding with passion. Her songs are also very well written. Track one, last blossom is breathtakingly powerful. The arrangment is different, but very cool, very well done. I have to give my props to whoever wrote it, the lyrics are superb. Another one of my fav was one hundred year of solitude, which is one of the best pop songs I've heard in my life. This album is great, the songs are diverse and well written. All my life I seem to be surround by bubble gum pop, that, while okay with the ears, lacks meaning. But Faye's pop definitely carrys much more weight. She sings them with a nonchalant passion that grows on you very very quickly. One of Asia's greatest pop stars. Faye rules!"
5,Lalo Pump Red patent leather!,"I loved this shoe! But, I had to send it back because my heel kept slipping out the back. I have narrow achilles. I was dissapointed because I loved the shoe and the color! It was beautiful and very sexy.I guess I won't be able to do mail order shoe shopping!"
4,"Good, concise narrative of Mexican conservation history","Simonian's book provides an excellent overview of the principal figures and events in the history of conservation in Mexico. The only improvement that could be made would have been to offer a more detailed analysis of the major events, leading to a profounder understanding of the reasons for the current state of conservation in Mexico. Ofcourse, this could only have been done in the course of longer book. For readers trying to understand conservation and environmental policy in the larger context of Mexican political and cultural history, I would strongly recommend reading an additional text on the general history of modern Mexico."
3,Decent science-fantasy teenage-adventure book,"____________________________________________I read The Gods & Their Machines after seeing a review that suggested it would be a good book for adults, too.Well, maybe for somebody else, but.... This is a pretty decent debut novel, but it's *definitely * YA, and, I'd guess, of no great interest to most readers over 20. GODS is written in broad, obvious strokes, and marred by a slow start, some PC preachiness and a particularly silly explosive-psi plot-device. Still, once it gets moving, it's an OK action-adventure written with some subtlety, and has some well-drawn characters. A ""C/C+"" book, for me anyway --but I'd keep an eye out for future books from McGann, who shows promise.Happy reading--Pete Tillman"
5,Great fenders.,"I decided to try these fenders after predictions of rain for the duration of my biking week in VA, OH, and IN. On my Trek FX there was really no trick to getting them on, but I did have to buy a small bolt for the chainstay bridge and two bolts for the second set of rear fender braces. I also used small nylon washers to protect the frame.These fenders are light and effective. On an unpaved rail-trail, they kept damp trail grime out of my running gear, off my frame, off of my shoes, and out of my bags. On the road, I stayed remarkably clean in a steady rain that lasted for 8 miles or so.Although I thought I might remove these fenders when I returned home. I will probably keep them on the bike if only to keep trail grime out of my chain, off my water bottle, and off of my shoes. They really do clean up your ride.The only down side to these fenders is you won't look like Lance. But if you ride every day and have to face challenging weather, you won't be disappointed."

1,Poor Universal Pictures Repackaging,"Note: This evaluation is on the ""Universal Pictures/Amazon.com Exclusive"" product - NOT the movie content! The movie itself, ""Death Takes a Holiday"", gets 5+ stars.Universal Pictures and/or Amazon.com did a sad job of repackaging this public domain offering and marketing it as an ""Amazon.com Exclusive"" 'vault series':1) No menu exists - No special features - No indexing2) The movie plays in a continuous loopSorry. $20? Amazon.com Exclusive? Give me a break. I have resorted to ""repackaging"" this offering myself with at least a menu and indexing (for my own consumption of course).Amazon states ""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media."" Where and by whom? I am doing a much better job at my home PC. Wait for the BitTorrent AVI and burn your own DVD-R - you couldn't possibly do a worse job."
4,Enjoyed it,"Watched cause we like Meet Joe Black so much and it is presumably loosely based on this movie. A bit like a stage play, really, but it works well and it's well done and interesting to the art and values of the early 30's on display. Frederick march is good."
3,Sweet but thin.,"Death Takes a Holiday only hints at the depth of emotion that Meet Joe Black investigates. Still, it's a sweet way of looking at life from a 1930s viewpoint. The location is one-note, insulating you (and Death?) from seeing life and love from the worldly viewpoint shown in MJB. The family relationships and friendships are fairly one-dimensional, another place that MJB beats DTAH hands-down. Frederick March carries himself with a stiff formality that I expected from Death, and his performance didn't disappoint. On the other hand, I found Brad Pitt's performance superior, thanks to his ability to combine that kind of formality with a naive wonder of what life--and love--really meant. All in all, it's worth seeing because the basic idea is so intriguing. See Meet Joe Black and make your own comparison."
2,"Poor. Whereas ""Meet Joe Black"" is long & boring,","""Death Takes a Holiday"" is merely boring. This is not a knock on Fredric March or Brad Pitt, both fine actors. It is simply creepy yet too one dimensional to be taken seriously. A play that did not transfer well. As for Death, aparently he likes to vacation with the stupid, idle, rich rather than real people. Ironically, these stiffs are already half dead. They have nothing to say yet prattle on endlessly about it. Death isn't much better. I fell asleep & had to rewind a bit. It didn't matter. Such excellent suject matter squandered twice 64 years apart. I really do like the old movie classics. This one... disappointing."
1,No Deal,"Like one reviewer has stated, Death Takes A Holiday is a five star film but this overpriced bootleg copy selling at $18 a pop is highway robbery. Didn't anyone listen to those stupid FBI warnings that preceded every movie from VHS to DVD to now Blu-ray? How is this form of producing a movie for sell any different than those illegal bootlegs that can cost someone up to 5 years in prison? And yes this goes not only for Amazon but for Warner Brothers' Archive Series as well.Do yourself a favor and buy Meet Joe Black: The Ultimate Edition. You get both films and, unlike the Vault Series edition, you get this classic film on an ""offical"" pressed disc that is guaranteed to play on all disc reading devices as well as the added bonus of having an actual chapter index for the film."

4,a good start,"I used this program with a gifted sixth grader this year. He found it interesting and challenging. That's pretty unusual! Since there are only 28 exercise sets, there was only just enough practice to begin to learn the concepts. I would like to see a lot more practice included for those of us who use it as a year's course in logic."
4,Give a reason that will hold up...,"Well written material based on a Christian format. This will challenge you to think and reason your arguments. It is challenging for High School, but fun and interesting."
3,A Sweet Memoir,"Anyone intrested in the architecture and way of life of Greenwich, Connecticut during the early 1900s will appreciate this sweet and simple memoir of Joan De Garmo that memorializes her mother-in-law Marjorie Prescott.The black and white photos are exquisite and tell as much of the tale as the narrative. It's like sneaking a glimpse into an old family album that has been collecting dust and cobwebs in the attic and finding long-forgotten relatives, each with a unique tale to tell.-- Patricia A. Burke, editor The Hungry Soul: An Online Literary Magazine"
1,this was a very long and drawn out book so dissapointed,ok when i first checked the over all review of this book iwas like yeah i gotta read that.; but once i started it i put it down like five times it was so predictable its basically nervous by zane with a lil ghettoism added i was once one of relentless aarons fans but this book is a huge no no dont waste your money!!!
3,Different Western - Interesting,This was one of the 'prequel' books written that filled in some of the history of the characters from the Floating Outfit.Was an interesting story of somewhat dubious historical accuracy but as always great action.One of the better JT Edson books.

4,Nice World History Almanac,"This is a very useful almanac if you are interested in World History, covers all the world, well designed and well written, contains basic information about the world history as expected from an Almanac. But, I have one thing to criticize. A little confusing, as the close civilizations in character fall apart in the book. So you jump from one civilization to a totally different one that takes you away from the subject on which you have already focused. Other than that, I think it is a better idea to make it more detailed in more volumes."
5,Great Reference,I learned more from this book than all my history classes. It compresses the history of humans from the beginning telling facts using diagrams and maps. It tells us how the human world evolved from nothing to what it is today.
4,Pats Review,this unit works vary well and you can purchase extra sd cards for the lakes you are going to go and fish at. Has vary good maps works vary well. The maps even show you the good fishing spots.
4,Colored People,Colored People is a good read. It is a story of Henry Gates' childhood. Yoou learn about his family and the struggles they went through to survive in a racist community. It also give the reader a better scence of family and strenght within one.
4,Life in Piedmont,"Colored People is a memoir written by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. about being black and growing up in Piedmont, West Virginia in the 1960's. Gates tells what it was like living in a small segregated town forty years ago. The book is full of themes, learned morals, and comical situations. Like all of us, Gates had some good times and bad times. He was discriminated at various times throughout his life, but handled most of it proudly. The book is multi-faceted, telling stories of educational and racial triumph, religious debate, as well as family and social journeys. Through Gates' eyes in this book, anyone can sporadically journey through his boyhood because it is so exquisitely written. One can almost feel the oppression that he must have felt growing up, which gives those who have never experienced racism a seemingly realistic chance to."
3,colored people,"Written with love, curiosity, and remembrance Gates tells a compelling story about his troubles growing up in the 1950's and `60s in a small town of piedmont, WV. Twelve years of age, Gates' mother's depressive disorder overwhelms him, Gates joins a Methodist church in luck to find spiritual serenity. This book was well written, although he did skip around from adulthood to adolescent times, the books structure and meaning was left intact."
4,Colored People,"I really enjoyed this book. I like the diction that was used because it didn't hold back, it portrayed the way life really was. I thought it was sad but interesting the way colored people lived. I also liked the way Gates told this story. He was very proud of his heritage and wasn't ashamed to leave any part out."
3,Inciteful,Colored People was an inciteful look into the life of an African American during a time when one was considered different if one wasn't white. Gates gives the reader plenty of detail and description regarding his life so that it's easy to relate with his memories. Though Gates did jump around a little bit from subject to subject he seemed to organize his life well enough to get his ideas across.
3,Colored People,"Colored People is a story that everyone should read. It does not matter what age, no matter where you live there will always be a sense of segregation or prejudice in the air. After reading a story like this you take everything into perspective and it makes you think about incidents in your own life that maybe you should have done or acted differently. Every chapter was an important moral or message that Gates was trying to prove. Some of the pages were hard to follow, but made sense at the end. This is the kind of book that makes you thankful for how good you might have had it, and taken it for granted, like myself. But after reading, I realize that for a majority of people, were not so lucky."
3,Colored People Review,"I am reading the personal narrative Colored People by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. The book was about Gates' childhood and what he endured through out his years of growing up in West Virginia. What I thought of the personal narrative was that it went into great detail about personal and social conflicts that occurred then. Gates explained is ideas in a way that could be easily understood however, some of the language that he used in the book was at times difficult to decipher. If I wanted to recommend this book for someone to read it, I would recommend it to someone of adulthood age to read it because I do not think that a person of younger status would understand the text and ideas that Gates is trying to imply."
4,Colored People--Humanities 101,"The novel ""Colored People, a Memoir"" by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. tells more than just the childhood story of a colored boy from Piedmont, WV in a segregated world. It brings to life the struggle of an entire race. Gates captures the struggle of African Americans during the civil rights movement. Although the memoir was intelligently written, the sequence was a bit hard to follow. Otherwise, I absolutely loved the book and would recommend it to anyone to read, especially those who want to embrace their culture and gain knowledge of what their relatives went through during the time of segregation."
3,"Colored People by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.","This is an autobiography by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. that talks about how he and his family grew up through the late 1800s til present day in Mineral County, WV. The book jumps from present day as him being a older man with his kids and telling them about his father, mother, siblings, grandparents, and friends to his childhood and what he went through. The big point in this book i thought was the segregation of whites and blacks. Most people do not want to remember those days when the whites ""owned"" black people and how hard it was for blacks to do daily living. But Gates specifies certain things that happened and how him and his family over came those events to make him into what he is today."
4,colored people review,"An overwhelmingly powerful book Colored People speaks of a young boy Henry gates who wrote about his life, his family and the difference among race in the late eighteenth century. In this book gates spoke about how colored people treated each other, their way of life and the events which took place that allowed colored and whites to integrate in his home town Piedmont West Virginia and other surrounding cities."
3,Colored People,I believe that this was an interesting book. It will show you how societies view youth. It was very perceptive. Henry Louis Gates provided the reader with lots of information on how segregation changed the lives of others during the 50'S and 60's. Henry Louis Gates is a realistic author who accurately depicts race and gender.
4,Colored People,"Colored People is the memoir of Henry Louis Gates Jr. This is the story of his life growing up in the ""colored"" section of the small town of Piedmont, WV. As a whole, the book is well written and engaging, although there are some problems with continuity. It is basically told in stories that at times seem to have nothing to do with one another, and can come across as random tales of his life. However, it is an entertaining read and provides good insight into the opinions of an African-American experiencing integration first-hand."
2,Colored People,3. I felt the book Colored People by Henry Louis Gates Jr. was a very uninteresting book and really didn't catch my attention. I felt that he gave to much information that really wasn't necessary. If I were to write this book over I would do many things different to make the reader more into the book. That is my view of the book Colored People
3,"Confusing, but Readable","I found this book to be thoroughly readable, even though I might not have been able to relate to specific events or scenes consistently throughout. Gates does a good job of keeping the reader occupied, though sometimes things get a little jumbled after jumping from family member to family member, and names start to get confusing. Overall, though not my normal read, I would recommend."
4,colored people part 2,This is a good book that deals with segregation in the 50's and 60's as young Gates grows up and makes his transition into man hood through civil rights movements.
3,Kendra's Review,"Colored People is a colorful depiction of a small town during the Civil Rights Movement. Henry Louis Gates, Jr. used beautiful wording and imaginative phrases to paint the picture of his childhood. It creates a wonderful viewpoint through which I was able to better understand this time period and those who lived through it. The words seemed to be carefully chosen and mindfully placed on the page. Overall it was both a good read and a very beneficial piece."
2,Colored People,"The book ""Colored People"" is a good book for anyone interested in what segregated life was like in West Virginia. The author, Gates, is very detailed in his descriptions of what life was like for him and his family. However, the book is hard to follow. Gates jumps from one story to the next without any warning. He also goes from stories of his childhood to where he is now, which makes this book a little confusing at times."
4,Colored People Review,"This book was about a boy named Henry Louis Gates Jr. He and his family lived in a small town called Piedmont in West Virginia. It was based during the 1950's. It was mainly about the life of Henry and how he was faced with many tough decisions dealing with his family, friends, religion, sexuality, and most important of all racism. He narrates this book by going back and forth to different stages of his life and telling us about many different situations he encountered. It seemed his family liked to stick with their own kind and not have much to do with the white race. They seemed somewhat racist towards the white people and that is one thing I didn't care too much for in this book. One character that I really admired in this book was Henry's mother. She was a really good person and did a very good job bringing up her son. That is one of the reasons that I think Henry Louis Gates Jr. turned out to be a pretty good guy."
2,Colored People,"This book is definitely a racial book that is very repetitive in its racism. This book talks of a boy who is growing up in a town in West Virginia where their is major discrimination that takes place. The aspect of the book that really kept confusing me was their were an enourmous amount of characters, and after a few chapters they all ran together. This book pretty much sums up a black kids life as he is growing up in a black and white community. There are major discrimination issues that take place in this book."
3,colored people,"In my reading of Colored People by Henry Louis Gates, Jr I found it be very informative, and was a eye opener to how the Black race was treated in West Virginia in that time period. I found this book to be an easy read, and it was not like it was a hassle to get through the book. As a white person I was a little ashamed to see how the white people of that time period treated, and how they viewed the black race. The only thing I have a problem with is how Gates would jump around from one incident to another. That would be the only thing about this book I did not like. I found this book to be very good, and informative in further my knowledge of the past. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read, and who also wants to learn something about how white and black people really viewed each other in that time period."
3,colored people,The novel colored people is a very good story about how a man could make it through the civil rights movement and never give up hope. Being from WV I understand the sort of trouble the author and his family went through. This book was difficult to read because it jumped around a lot. Over all I recommend this book to anyone who wants to broaden there knowledge of what life was like during the civil rights movement in WV.
3,Colored People Review,"Colored People is overall a very interesting book. It is a bit confusing when Gates switches back and forth between the Gates family and Coleman family. Aside from that, it is a fascinating look into the life of an African-American family during the civil rights period. It describes what they had to go through and how they dealt with the horrible racism of the time. For people who have never experienced anything like that in their lives it is a great way to know a little bit of what it would be like to be in their shoes. After reading this book I now have a better perspective of what it was like for an African-American person living during this time."
4,Colored People,Henry Louis Gates Jr. wrote Colored People and this is a book about growing up as a colored person before equal rights were in force. Although the book skips around from him talking about his childhood and adulthood if read correctly it makes perfect sense and is not hard to follow. This book describes how Gates went though a terrible childhood but managed to become successful despite his challenges. It is a great book that I highly recommend.
4,Colored People Review,"Colored People is a very interesting book. The world then seems so different than it is now and it wasn't even that long ago. It shows Gates' childhood and what he had to go though with race. It shows his teenage years and adulthood dealing with race. This book also shows his true emotions and his real life making you seem closer to the author. Racism has changed since then and this book shows you from an African American's view. It deals with emotion, the real world, and struggles making this a book I would recommend to anyone."
3,Interesting yet sometimes confusing,"Throughout this book, I find myself confused at what age he is when some of these events occur. First he starts at the age of 4, then jumps to the age of 13 in the same chapter. The next chapter he is 8! Other than all of the chronological confusion I find the book to tell an interesting story. Everything he describes gives the reader a vivid image of what he is talking about. His description of his family shows real emotion and feeling."
3,Humanites Assingment,I thought that this book was ok. It was hard to follow all the different peole in the book. There wer eso many different characterstaht it was a little bit confusing. Some of the stories were pretty entertaining though. it was refreshing to look at someone from an entirley different culture and generation then my own. it tended to drag at time s though. All in all it was ok.
3,Colored People,"This book is sort of interesting but then again boring and confusing. He did a great job explaining his life in West Virginia and dealing with the racial problems, but he jumped around to much and it confused me. I would have to re-read things and try to understand it then understand some more. But thats the only part that would make me loose interest and get confused. Other then that it was a good book and good explaining the life of an African American in Piedmont, West Virginia."
2,To Appreciate,"To really appreciate the book Colored People you would have to be a person in Henry Louis Gates' family or someone that has known him and his family. I really didn't get much out it myself. The story jumped around too much. One time he was talking about his childhood, then his adult life with his own kids, then his teenage years with his family, then his school life, and so on. The book did not have much organization. A few of the individual stories he told were interesting, but did not transition well into the rest of the book. He also used a lot of profanity and sexuality in the story. They might be true, but he shouldn't have made them as prevalent as he did. Overall, I would not recommend the book."
3,"Colored People, a College Freshman's view","The book Colored People by Henry Louis Gates Jr. was an influential book, though it did not exactly catch my eye, nor did I enjoy reading it, I would recommend it to those people that enjoy reading. It has many ups and downs, a variety of scenes, a variety of language, and it shows how life in one town can be for `colored' people."
3,African American History,"Colored People was an insightful novel, which allows others to experience past history. Gates did a wonderful job describing his experience as a child and what it was like to grow up in Piedmont, West Virginia. Segregation was a daily experience for him and his family, and the book explains how they overcome the obstacles of racism. The book allows readers to gain a better grasp on African American history in the 1950s and 1960s that most were not aware."
2,The struggle for Equal Rights,"The book showed what it was like to live in a predominantly white town. It showed the struggle that black people faced during the civil rights movement. I am from Georgia so a lot of things he describes in the book, are things I see everyday at home. There is still a lot of segregation in the south. I think this book would be good for someone to read if they wanted to learn about the fight the African-American people fought to survive during the movement."
4,Colored People the Review,The book was very detailed and descriptive. It held your interest throughout the book. Made you more aware of how things worked back then.
3,Colored People,"The book Colored People, written by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. was interesting and boring. He grew up in Piedmont, West Virginia during the time of the civil rights movement. Every colored man in the town pretty much worked at the paper mill and made the same amount of money. He attended a black and white school that was consolidated in 1956. Gates was not accepted in many places for being black, but in the end was a well-educated man."
3,"""Colored People"" Class Review","I thought that the book had some strong points and some weak points. I think that Henry Louis Gates strong points were that he did a wonderful job of describing what it was like to grow up in Piedmont, W.V. during the civil rights movement. It is very interesting to see that Gates became a highly educated man even though he had to deal with segregation and racial discrimination. Although very interesting, I think that Gates needed some kind of sequential order. Gates jumped around from age to age too much, he needed to keep chronological order to keep the readers from becoming confused and losing interest."
2,I did not enjoy this book. The author stories were to radom.,"Colored People is a book that is based on the author Henry Louis Gates'. Jr. life. Gates grew up doing a time with African-Americans were treated poorly. Gates describes his struggles as growing up, while trying to fit in a recently segregated school. Growing up in Piedmont, Wv Gates encountered his loving family and also whites that did not accept him. Gates struggles help him go on to become a highly educated man."
3,Colored People Review by Josh Combs,"Colored People by Henry Louis Gates Jr. gives the reader a good view of the way the life was in West Virginia during the civil rights movement. It depicts the way things were in West Virginia, and also how different it was from the other states during this time period. I think that this book is a must read for anyone that would like to learn about how the civil rights movement affected the state of West Virginia."
3,Colored People,Colored People is an autobiography of Henry Gates life. The story deals with Gates past as he grew up during the Civil Rights movement. He gives an in depth description of people in his life and events from his past. While the book holds your attention it is harder to understand do to the fact that it jumps around. An excellent story about the History of the Civil Rights movement.
3,Colored People,"The book ""Colored People"" by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., is an interesting recollection of memories during the Civil Rights movement in West Virginia. He recalls the stories with love and great detail. His moments are memorable, reflecting the values of West Virginia. Although I grew up in a different time and place than Gates, and I am not of the same race, I can still relate to some of the stories he tells in this book. His style of writing is ""bouncy"", but I believe this adds to the book, making it an easy read. Three out of five stars."
2,Classic Kung fu observer,"This film takes me way back to the days of ""Drive in Movie"" on Saturday afternoons. I would like to say to order this kung fu classic but the copy I got had digital problems during the later half of the film. I'm not totally thrown off from the classics but beware from who you order from. I rate this copy extremely low, so buyer beware."
5,CLASSIC NINJA,I bought this after reading the Amazon reviews and they were 100% right what a great Ninja movie.
3,Endlessly inventive action plus a bit of attention to character,Endlessly inventive (and fairly bloody) fights as opposed to the interminably repetitive fights martial Arts films of the era are prone to. There are even a few nice little character moments.
5,Laurel & Hardy never seem to get a break,"L&H; are down on their luck in the 30s when they find a wallet full of cash. A crook starts chasing them and they are saved bya local cop. Grateful, they offer to buy the cop lunch, only to discover the wallet belongs to the cop. The boys just never seemto get a break."
1,RABBIT LOG,"This log looks big in the picture, but it is realy small when you receive it. My rabbit can not get his head in it, so how can he get his whole body in. Good for small animals only. not rabbits"
4,A great teaching tool!,I had to use this book in one of my English classes and it was a thorough book. It had helpful exercises as well.
1,Falls apart,Acoustically it was ok but it kept falling apart. The areas where it was screwed in would just fall on the ground. I noticed several other people in my class with the same kind of scope and theirs would fall off too.
3,Good for the money,I bought this stethoscope so I can listen to my son's breathing since he has asthma and to hopefully hear the heart beat of my unborn baby. It comes with a lot of parts but doesn't explain very well how exactly they work. The original bell works very well for listening for wheezing in my little boy which is the most important part. I'm 32 weeks and can't hear the fetal heartbeat though with this product. My biggest complaint is that the ear pieces are terribly uncomfortable. I wear it just long enough to hear what I have to. Over all though it's good for the price. If you're going to be using a stethoscope a lot I would suggest buying something a little higher end for better comfort.
2,I haven't received.,"I haven't received my stethoscope yet, I bought it like a month ago or maybe more and I am still waiting for it :S I don't know what's the problem.please someone help me I need it, I can't answer the second question because I haven't received."
3,It doesn't come with a vocal version.,I wish it would have vocal version so my daughter can sing along but only seeing lylics was hard for her to follow.
4,TRO:3050,"I love the battle tech game, and mech warrior computer games, and this is very helpfull. It shows the new clan mechs, I.S. mechs, and vehicles. It's fairly good, but hasn't any color photos like TRO:3058. Thats why I gave it an eight. If you're a battle tech maniak like me, and you play games right when the clan invasion started, this is the book for you."
4,A perfect supplement to cover the Clan mechs of 3050,"The 3050 readout covers all the mechs and vehicles of the year Kerensky comes back with the clans. If you want to play out BattleTech through Mechwarrior 2, this is your era. Only complaint is terrible pictures compared to the rest of the tech readouts"
5,Product is fine but!,"I know this product is good the problem is it never got here even though amazon said it was delivered. There were supposed to be 2 sizes of brads, 3/4 "" and 5/8 "" , the 3/4 "" brads are delivered in the box that was supposed to contain both sizes. I cannot figure out to make a claim of a partial delivery without returning the good delivered item to get the missing item replaced. Seeing that its only a few dollars and because Amazon is such a great source for me I am just going to reorder the missing item and eat the loss. It was over the Christmas Holidays so that could be the problem."
3,Not what I envisioned..,"This is an attractive coffee table book, with some amazing maps of the city and region, especially 19th century maps. The 1833 Conley and Seltzer map stands out. The Palmatary View from 1857 is another standout. The maps of the 2 World's Fairs are also absolutely fantasticSo, why 3 stars?The problem is the level of detail. The maps, for the most part, are reproduced in such small size that a magnifying glass is necessary to really appreciate them. You can't make anything out on them. The other problem is the lack of 20th century maps, especially maps of the latter half of the 20th century. These issues make it difficult to really appreciate this book."
2,Maps are too small,This would be a great book if it was larger. Most of the maps are far too small. Even with a magnifying glass much of the detail on the maps can't be made out. What good is a map you can't read? A real shame.
4,Not Too Bad,Leave it to Cliff Notes to produce another fine study aid to classic literature pieces. The insights were intuitive and well thought out and it made the difficult plays to read and understand quite easy. I would recommend it to anyone having to read any of the included plays.
2,Bistro Chef,Not very pleased with this one. Too small to be of any real value. It is cute and makes a good decoration on a kitchen shelf but not a lot of practical value.
3,Wantin' more of the blues...,"In my opinion, this CD is missing a bit of the raw Tedeschi bluesiness that I love so dearly, but I hate to be critical of such a superbly talented woman!"
2,This Is Not Why I buy Susan Tedeshi,"I realize that some artists think that after a point in their careers, they need to ""grow,"" or, ""mature,"" or becom more ""refined."" With this CD Susan may very well find a 'new' audience, however, it may come at the cost of her fans that have come along with her up to this point.For me, the thing that makes Susan desirable over that of just another female vocalist is her ""real"" raw cutting style. The ""real"" Susan was produced-out of this CD. Some artists' styles are good for polished-production and a high-gloss studio finish; ...not Susan Tedeshi.I wish I would have listened to some tracks before I laid down the money.R Buckner ~ Grants Pass, Oregon"
2,Get Just won't Burn,Not nearly as good as Just Won't Burn...For my taste anyway.I guess it's because Just Won't Burn is so good it's hard to accept anything less.
2,Huge Disappointment!,"Blues singers shouldn't try to go mainstream. If they do try and succeed, fine. That means they've stayed true to their roots. When they try and fail (as Susan has done with Hope and Desire), one would hope they'd try to get back to where they started. For me that was Just Won't Burn. I guess when one is happily married with children, it's hard to sing the blues since you're not feeling them . . . you're faking them."
2,"bland, boring, been there...","that's really all i've got to say. there's no fire in susan's voice, there's no spirit to the arrangements. when the opening song is the most bland version of ""i've got the silver"" you can possibly imagine, things are not going to get better. and they don't."
4,Her Covers are Great!,"That voice is superb - her readings of soul classics are incredible...Soul of a Man and Lord Protect My Child are two stand outs. Her band is pristine, but it's clearly Susan drivin that train. This CD has that 1960's/70's breezy soul feel that brings back summertime memories with ices and AM radio. Love her, love the CD, makes you glad secure artists like her have no problems covering classics and even lesser-known gems. Great CD all around and highly recommended by this blues traveler."
4,Love the album,Love the album... probably only one song on the whole thing I don't listen to. Would recommend for fans of her other albums.
5,Like Braiding?,The patterns in this book are easy to follow and there are enough lovely patterns to keep you busy for a long time if you like braiding.
4,A Source book in Cosmology,"Source Book in MathematicsI found this book a useful history book ( I didn't know Bessel was an astronomer).I think the beginning where Hubble is quoted about his way of looking atscience is almost as important to me as the rest of the book.In the present period with progress in both telescopes on the ground and in space,we may not realize how recent ignorance was and the workresponsible for reaching our present knowledge.With Hawking predicting an end to science in the 1980's,we find in the early 2000's that we have found a new level of ignorance.I appreciate that others gave their lifetimes toadvancing science and thinking new thoughts aboutthe shape of the universe."
5,The Kweeks of Kookatumdee,My children and I loved this book. The colorful way Bill Peet teaches lifelong lessons and inspires the reader to rise and search for much higher abilities within themselves is appreciated and rewarding! We've shared his stories with our children's friends as well as other adults that also found it inspiring and uplifting!! He truely teaches to look within yourself for answers and strength beyond what you may expect to find!!
1,Shallow Fiction. Where Is The Archeological Proof?,"This is the worst book I've ever read on ancient history. The author minimizes the negatives of the so-called Celtic culture, while portraying the Greeks and Romans as the destroyers of Western Civilization rather than the FOUNDERS of it. Throughout this revisionist tirade he presented no proof of his claims.In reversing the archaeological and written records he wants the credulous reader to believe that the various tribes that are lumped together under the false Celtic umbrella somehow built the world we now live in. I don't know how this rubbish got published? I recommend any books by Michael Grant, Adrian Goldsworthy, B.H.Liddell Hart, & John Collis' "" Celts: Origins And Re-inventions"" as a truthful balance to this nonsense."
1,1 Star Is Being Kind. Evidence ???,"The other 1 star reviews were overly polite. I have read hundreds of books on ancient history in my 80 years. But, this author clearly has multiple axes to grind. In order to re-write history one needs ""plenty of proof. You will not find any here!"" Read Livy, Polybius, Athenaeus, Herodotus, or Florus. If one wants to believe in the Celts try Barry Cunliffe. If a person wants to learn the truth about our western heritage? They would be wise to read ""authentic scholars like David Gress and Michael Grant."" I have read five of the authors ranting books, they are all the same. The Celts are the Alpha and Omega of everything. The fact is they are not!"
5,Heaven Send,"A1 is not a 'typical' boyband and they have proven it with this album. It's a mix of pop, rock, accoustic, and more. A1 has a unique style. This album is definately worth buying!"
5,melissa's a1 review,"a1's new album is soo great! i recommend it to everyone. they have a great but edgy sound that almost anyone can relate to. ""caught in the middle"" is a smash single that you've just got to hear! buy the album today!!!!"
4,I feel sharing the Jesus' heart and mind with Him...,"I feel sharing the Jesus' heart and mind with Him...Everyday, through the help of this book. When I read the Bible, I focused on the event,theme, or things to be learned. But reading Peterson's book, ""Praying with Jesus:A Year of Daily Prayers and Reflections on the Words and Actions of Jesus"", I feel Jesus to near me than I think, and experienced. Why don't you try to pray with Jesus...? Soon I will get one more book for giving my friend... (I will say thanks to Eugene Peterson.)"
5,A must for fans off classic Avenged Sevenfold,"Simply put, if you call yourself a true Avenged Sevenfold fan, this is a must for your collection. It features a superior version of ""Second Heartbeat"", a demo version no less, that was later re-recorded, but sounded flat on Waking the Fallen."
2,another frustrating title,"I bought this for a 7 and 11 year old girl. We gleefully put it in the Wii and within 10 minutes of fussing with it, it was done for and hasn't been played again. The Wii controls aren't hard to master with it, but you have no idea what you are trying to do on the game. We tried to have Chicken Little do some jumps and shoot, and it is picky, and you fall, and you start back where you were, and you do it ten more times and decide you don't really enjoy this and put the game away. We just got Elebits, and hey, that one is much more popular with the kids."
3,Disappointed with this one!,"I was recommended this book on the same day as someone told me about another book. I bought both after reading the mostly positive reviews. This one was disappointing. I found Faust's writing style juvenile and barely entertaining at best. Her story is weak and predictable. You'd be better off reading the other book that was recommended to me that day: ""Unbroken"" by Jason Babin. Much, much, much better than this one."
5,Classic Westlake Caper,"If you are a Donald Westlake fan - or even if you aren't - you will enjoy Somebody Owes Me Money. Even though it's not a Dortmunder Novel - and if you don't know what these are, you need to find out - Westlake writes with his signature humorous style that makes for a quick and very enjoyable read."
4,Hitchcock-like Thriller is a Winner...,"Chester Conway is a New York cabbie who wins money on a horserace; unfortunately, when he goes to collect from a friend/bookie, the man is found dead...and Conway is pursued by the police, the mob, and a beautiful blond whose attire consists of a skirt and black leather boots throughout the novel (a plus!)...Each chapter is a cliffhanger, and there are many 'twists and turns' since everybody seems to think Conway had something to do with the murder...and Conway (like an Alfred Hitchcock character) is in much of the dark as the people pursuing him.I would have expected more from the ending considering Conway went through a lot in the novel to get to the bottom of his bookie's murder, but majority of the novel has a pretty good pace, and the characters were interesting.Recommended...."
3,Your Choice Live Series,"The sound quality of the live concert recorded on this CD is a little low, which is bad for Steel Pole Bathtub's style of music. The major problem, is the entire CD is 1 track, all the songs together. I ripped them to wavs and had to manually cut the songs into seperate files then convert them to ogg vorbis. This should not be your first Steel Pole Bathtub record if you are new to them. Get Miracle of sounds in motion, cocktail suggestions, etc, but if you like SPB(T) then you will eventuall buy this CD."
4,hip hop for purists,"DSP (Dynamic Syncopation) are probably one of the lesser known Ninja Tune acts...at least in America. Their first album was mostly abstract hip hop instrumentals, with MCs(Mass Influence, etc.) on a couple of tracks, very similar to the Herbaliser and DJ Vadim. 'In the Red' is a little more straight foward and features dope MCs on every track, except the interludes...and it really stand out from the current hip hop in the market place. I feel like this album is truly a return to real hip hop, sort of like what Mr. Lif does, with out the political agenda. No bs, not much experimenting, just excellent beats with dope rhymes. Very positive but lethal at the same time. Mass Influence returns on this album, bringing probably the best track...'Systematic'. The last track, 'No Regrets' is hot to...a cinematic beat with introspective lyrics. Definitely worth checking out."
1,a piece of junk,"What a piece of junk this is. It doesn't maintain a connection and sounds likes you're underwater even when standing next to my wireless router (my laptop, however, maintains an excellent connection even in the next room, so I know it's not my router). Half a year later it won't even turn on. Do not buy this piece of junk!"
2,good idea but poor product,"I bought this item a few months ago. Most of the time I can not hear the other caller. Reception is terrible. Although, my internet connection is excellent I still have a sound problem. Battery dies quick too. Over all this product does not deliver a good service.This phone needs a lot of improvement. Basiclly, it's an unfinished product."
1,problems with connection,After some time the phone has problems to connect to the wi-fi then it has problems with the keypad making it unusable
1,Save your money,"First phone defective. Battery would discharge promptly. After much time and gnashing of teeth with technicians with heavy Indian accents (forget ever getting customer service to call you despite the message to leave your call back number), got SMC to send me a replacement. SMC sent me a USED phone (still had someone else's login on it), with a broken speaker. Technician (in broken English) said he could not help me, and I would need to contact customer care for a replacement. Customer care was as usual a recorded message telling me to leave my name and number and they would call back (which, consistent with past practice, they never did). To their credit most of the technicians attempted to be helpful. However, the phone is shoddy, and a piece of shoddy workmanship. Save your money!"
3,B DAT,"I really enjoy my buckle my mate liked it as well. He asked me to get him a buckle. I have worn it already, and it looked very nice on me. The only thing I don't like about the buckle is that the point that it has can be very porky. It sticks my in my stomach a little, but that is for people who have a little gut or a big gut. Other than that I really like the buckle."
5,EXCELLENT,"This is one of my favorite books. Lurlene McDaniel was recommended to me by a friend who had leukemia. Through her books, I was able to understant what my friend was going through. Her books have an emotional level to them. You can't read any of her books without crying at least once, and smiling a few times. Lurlene McDaniel is one of the best authors. I would recommend her books to anyone and everyone. THIS IS JUST A GREAT BOOK!"
4,GREAT STORY.,"I liked the story, but I was a little disappointed with the ending. I felt that it left me a little hanging. Other than that i thought it was an aweseom book.I couldn't stop reading it. I was done with the book in no time. I got so engrossed in the book that i would catch myself wanting to tell Sarah what i would do if i was her. I recommend this book to people so that they can open up their hearts. It shows the true meaning to family. It was a super book."
2,An Adopted Girl with Cancer faces tough choices.,"This is not my favorite book by Lurlene McDaniel. I did not have much sympathy for the main character, Sarah. It must be difficult to find out that you are adopted but all of a sudden she doesn't treat the people who love her as her family anymore. The end of the novel is disappointing because it would have been nice to find out what happened to her."
5,Ashley's Review,"I really, really liked this book because Lurlene McDaniel wrote it and she is my favorite author!Sarah has leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant or there is no hope. Sarah later finds out she was adopted. Sarah tries to find her birth mother. She locates her and travels to meet her. Sarah hopes her birth mother can donate bone marrow for her. Sadly, Sarah finds out that her birth mother had breast cancer and can't donate bone marrow and her real father was killed.I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in both leukemia and adoption!!"
3,Left me unsatisfied,"I started this book with great expectations,since I'm a fan of Mrs. McDaniel's books. Unfortunately,this one wasn't up to her usual caliber. Sure,it was touching and suspenseful. I liked that the lead female stayed single, and I could identify with her feelings. But she was too harsh towards her family when she found out she was adopted,and they were the ones who loved her. At least she realized how much they meant to her. Her biological mother's reaction to her at their 1st meeting was even more outrageous. Luckily,that was resolved,too. If the ending hadn't left readers hanging,this book would've been much better. Please,Mrs.McDaniel,write a sequel so we can find out what happens to Sarah!"
2,Little added,"Ed Slott repeated alot of what was included in ""The Retirement Savings Time Bomb..."", so I was not as impressed with this book. You can get 98% of what to do in the ""Time Bomb"". But if you really want to save all your money to your kids and their kids, it should help you."
4,Parlay Your IRA into a family fortune,Very good information. Is vital information that would be very useful to anyone with a large IRA and a significant number of beneficiaries.
3,Grappling,"This is definitely a series for a historian or history major. Intriguing ideals,concepts, strange offshoots of actual history.That being said, the author has a tendency to be repetitive about certain characters but at this point I want to finish this series. MORRELL FOR PRESIDENT!!!"
5,Epic scope,"Turtledove's latest in the Great War/American Empire/Return Engagement series is epic in scope and ambition -- and largely succeeds, in my opinion. We see again that it's really America that has been ""the lucky country"", and how much worse it might have been."
2,Nothing New,"Harry Turtledove was once a writer of creativity and imagination. Well, that's history. What's left is endless repetition and recycling of earlier material. Has anyone else noticed that he has now TWICE used the Stalingrad concept in his fiction? (Okay in two separate series, but come on.) Most of this book, as in much of his work these days, is simple filler. I have seriously wondered if its all done by some writing program, or student interns, and if he ""oversees"" the work and signs his name to it....Look, I used to LOVE his work. NOW he could actually be dead, and still churn out work of the same creativity and originality. I don't know what's worse, if he IS still doing the writing, or if he ISN'T. Sorry..."
3,"I'm a fan, but I'm having trouble finishing this volume","I've bought every book in this series as soon as they came out, and I usually read them in a week. This time I keep leaving it for weeks at a time, unable to slog through the filler surrounding the plot. It's been months, and I'm only half-way through. The action seems to be moving soooooo slooooowly.Sure; I'll keep reading it. And I'll buy the last book of the series too. But I'm getting increasingly aggravated at the author's ponderous writing style.And like every other reader, I'm incredibly sick of reading about the relative merits of Confederate and Yankee cigarettes. Enough! Perhaps Turtledove is a former smoker, and he can't get them off his mind."
3,A Roller-Coaster story,"As a long time fan of HT's alternate history stories I found this book disappointing. I refer to it as a roller-coaster because in my reading I would enjoy certain parts so much I would race through the story with great zeal. In other parts, however, I felt such drudgery I would look ahead hoping the story would pick up.So the Yankee cigarettes are nasty, we get it. The guerilla stories seemed to constantly repeat each other so we didn't need two accounts (Moss & Cassius) of this part of the war. It would have also been nice to occasionally throw in information of what was going on in the rest of the war abroad.Although I was disappointed it was still good enough that I will read HT's next work. It just didn't seem up to his usual high standards."
4,What you get.....,"For those of you who have enjoyed this series, I heartily recommend ""The Grapple."" Being back with familiar characters on the Yankees' drive to the sea is like putting on a pair of comfortable shoes. Within this circle of readers, the book gets four stars from me. Why anybody out there who has not enjoyed the earlier installments would even consider reading this latest one is a mystery to me. As the story looks like it may finally be on the way to a real climax, there is one deficiency I will bring up. The series would be enhanced if it contained two additional characters; first a Southerner who actively resists the Confederate regime; and second a Yankee doing the same to his own country. One must keep in mind that Turtledove gives us light, escapist, fare with a dose of grimness to stretch our imaginations, not great literature to be analyzed and nit-picked. I do acknowledge that Turtledove's faults are amusing to discuss, but I will leave that to the rest of you!"
2,Minimal detail,"This is a pamphlet and in my opinion not worth the money. It will fit in a backpacks for quick identification of birds, but it really stinks for learning more about Oklahoma birds."
3,pamplet,great for carrying with you. Kids loved looking for birds and then looking at the pamplet to find the name of the birds
4,Well written review,"It was required reading book for my biogeochemistry class. I would say this book covers a lot of topics and is well written. It described concisely the general picture of the global biogeochemistry. So if someone is interested in reviewing general concepts and idea about global biogeochemistry, I would certainly recommend this book. Although being short was advantage of the book, it is also its drawback. Therefore sometimes someone might find that you need more information in order to fully understand mechanism behind certain process or calculation. If you are already familiar with the concept and got general idea, then this book might bore you. Otherwise, I would say, this is right book for someone who is just interested in seeing big picture and ignoring the details."
4,SOLID BUT COULD'VE BEEN BETTER,"i was kinda disappointed when i heard this cause ill bill is nicer than what i heard on this album.the album was mostly that overproof thug s**t.it wasn't as well thought out as the nonphixion ""the future is now"".imo this is the weakest solo album from nonphixion.the sabac red ""sabacalypse: a change gon' come"" is the illest,next the goretex ""the art of dying"",and then the ill bill.it just seemed like he didn't give it his all.don't get me wrong,this album is NOT wack,i just feel he could've done better but still worth checking out."
1,you should be ashamed of yourself,this is the most ingnorant thing i have ever heard or seen in my lifetime. i would rather burn my money and slice my own throat at the same time than buy this album.
1,Not what I expected.,"I can't believe I'm the only one to not give this five stars. Non Phixion is a good hip hop group, but solo they aren't too powerful. this album is seriously lacking, the beats sound like your typical mainsream rap beats and the lyrics are straight up boring."
3,Never received it,"I love this book, so I was very excited to order it for a co-worker's baby shower. However, despite both the packing slip and every other form of receipt claiming that the book was included, I never received it. I tore apart the box. I looked through the extra packing paper very carefully. I looked in and around the other items that arrived in the same box, but it was not there. I left a comment about the packaging, but I never heard anything back from Amazon. Very disappointed.The book itself deserves five stars, as far as I'm concerned. It's a great board book, and my niece enjoyed ""reading"" it on her own from the time she was six or seven months."
5,Another hit with the one year old crowd,"My daughter loves this book, maybe even more than her beloved, tattered ""Are You My Mother"" board book. I bet we have read this one a hundred times since Xmas!! The illustrations are wonderful and the alphabet ""rhymes"" are hilarious. I am in the process of purchasing all of PD Eastmans board books for her-I enjoy them as much as she does!"
4,A fun alphabet picture book,"I remember this book from my own childhood, so I had to add it to my son's ever-growing book collection. I like the illustrations as well as the alphabet. Maybe the 'I - Indian with ice cream' is not politically correct and the 'X - Xylophone for Xmas' might be offensive to some, but hey, this book has a 1974 copyright date and the world was a different place back then."
4,My second filter in 15 years.,"This is a replacement filter for the exact model. It is used as a pre-filter for well water pumped to storage from underground. The filters require frequent cleaning to remove the granite rock drill dust from the pumped water...and do a good job. The original one installed was replaced because the housing suddenly split open and failed. Be careful when installing not to overtighten the pipe fittings as the filter housing can break from overtightening the installed piping. Also, be careful with the lid gasket , it can be misaligned and leak. But, overall this is a very good filter."
3,Hayward C17502 Star-Clear Plus 175-Square-Foot Cartridge Filter,Broken gauge on delivery. Returned it. Amazon is great that way. Second one: Broken gauge. Returned. Third one: Broken gauge! Kept it. Ordered a new gauge. After six months outlet port started leaking.
2,"Bad Shipping, Great Customer Service Afterwards","What a nightmare! The filter and housing quality from Hayward would be fine, if the item had arrived undamaged. The PSI gauge on the housing was broken, and after running the pump for a week, I discovered that the cartridge element didn't seat correctly. Had to buy a new cartridge from a local supply house. I did contact Amazon and shipped a replacement unit. The PSI gauge on this unit was in even worst condition, the box had been opened and resealed by a previous customer, even had a dental flosser trapped in the sealing tape on the outside of the box. In all fairness, Amazon was great about correcting the problem, their return service and credits were flawless and they finally made me happy. However, some one at Amazon is shipping out products with out checking out the quality of the item, if the item was a customer return. I put a note inside the box stating that the filter cartridge and PSI gauge were defective. I wonder if anyone noticed?"
2,Not a good strength training book!,"I was shocked to see that this book got such high reviews. I found it to be extremely lacking. I suppose it might be alright for a woman whose never lifted a weight in her life, but for anyone serious about weight training, this book will not help you. I highly recommend Strength Training Anatomy (not the women's version). I use now use that book to formulate all my strength routines."
4,Strength Training for Women,"I really like this book. Sometimes I need a little reminder of posture, etc. The photos and instructions are clear. This is probably not meant for someone who has been strength training for a long time, but is good for someone like myself."
5,Motivating and Inspiring!,"Fantastic, motivating book! Although I have been working out for years.... weights, yoga, running, I realized that there was a lot to fitness that I just did not understand. This book answered so many of my often-thought-about-but-never-answered questions. The inspiring pictures are awesome!! and there are many useful, helpful hints about how to work out properly."
5,Strength training for women,"This is a good book for a women who wants to add strength training to her workout program. The pictures make it easy to follow and there notes of where to ""feel it"" offers a good way to know if you are doing the activity correctly. It offers programs at a glance which also helps to do the program once the moves are familiar. I use it in conjunction with a weight training workout CD (Denise Austin) so that I really understand the best way to make my workout successful and the time well spent. This is also a DK books which are generally well done and easy to follow."
2,just the screen,"If you're like me, you're hoping that this is the cartridge that contains the screen, and that you can simply swap it out on your wall. It is not. It's just the mesh, and you have to dismantle the cartridge (and the opposite side, with the handle) to replace it. I'm not happy that the replacement part is a subset of the original, but here I am, without instructions, dismantling the cartridge. I'm not thrilled. I'd just as soon buy a whole new screen door."
1,CReynolds,"Do NOT buy from ODL unless you are certain you won't need any customer service! The replacement screen we ordered came with no installation instructions, and was the wrong size for our retractable unit. When we attempted to contact ODL, it took weeks to get a straight answer on how to return the product for an exchange. Finally, after they received our item, EXACTLY as it had been shipped to us, they emailed us and told us that it was not returned in a sellable condition, so no exchange would be honored. The ODL retractable screen is a great idea and a good product, as long as it lasts and doesn't need repair. Unfortunately, ODL does not stand behind its products or offer any real customer service - and that makes it a waste of good money."
2,complicated install,This product is not easy to install. I wish I had just bought a new retractable screen door.
5,GOOD BACKUP!!,"I have bought one of the sliding screens for our mobil home. On a mobil home you have to get and extra top rail to mount to the floor. I called them, and they sent me one at no charge to make it work. I got the extra screen insert, just incase one of our dogs run through the screen? For me, it's a good backup to have. SW"
4,Bosch Bits,"Nice set, very sharp. Cobalt is the way to go if you let the bit do the work. I was tired of worn out cheap bits and even bought a drill sharpener. They just would not sharpen or last. So far these bits have been great.I plan on throwing out all of my old bits."
3,I prefer the DeWalt bits,"I first because very impressed with cobalt bits after drilling a ton of holes in 1/4 red iron with dewalt bits and the bosch just don't last nearly as long. without a pilot hole the bits above 3/16"" wear out much faster than the dewalts. It's the nicest case for drill bits i've ever had though so it gets' three stars, when one brakes or wears out, i just replace it with a dewalt..."
4,great bits,"the bits are great and go through anything, though i wish the case would fit into the drill's carrying case. in any event the bits are excellent."
4,Ugly Cheap Case,"On April 10, 2006 Michael A. Swanner reviewed this set and said, ""It's the nicest case for drill bits I've ever had""butOn April 26, 2010 A. Spartana reviewed this set and said, ""the case could use some work. The latch popped off the first time I shut the case, but I was able to pop it back on. The holders for the bits are also made of cheap plastic, and probably won't last nearly as long as the bits will.""The case pictured on the web page for this set shows a different case than what I received. The case I received is the case from the half price titanium bit set: Bosch TI18 18-Piece Titanium Twist Drill Bit Assortment with Plastic Case.Maybe this case is better than the old case, but I've already started to look for a new case.Minus a star for the case and lying about it. Otherwise, awesome bits."
2,slow and dragging,Loving Kevin Canty's other works I picked up this newest adition. It started slow and grew slower and slower. Some chapters were ok but overall it dragged on for 400 pages. I recomend reading Into The Great Wide Open again instead of this.
2,A let-down,"I was really excited to read ""Nine Below Zero"" after reading Kevin Canty's first novel, ""Into The Great Wide Open,"" but this one kind of left me cold (so to speak.) I don't mind a book that's bleak if there's a teensy ray of hope somewhere, but Canty can't seem to offer us one. Sure, ""Into the Great Wide Open"" was also about a man obsessed with a screwed-up woman, but in that book, he was able to give us a sense of why the man found the woman so compelling. In ""Nine Below Zero,"" it's much harder to figure out why the man would even give the woman the time of day. That said, Canty does describe the Montana landscape beautifully, and his writing has an attractively spare and clean quality."
2,Just Shoot Me,"Since his brilliant debut with the short story collection, A Stranger in This World, Kevin Canty has yet to achieve that same level of taut, precarious ennui. In contrast to the upside-down world of his short stories, his two novels read like those substance abuse pamphlets you pick up on the mental hygiene floors of hospitals. The psuedo-protagonist in Nine Below Zero, Jess, ceases to fascinate after the first twenty pages...she is entirely unsympathetic, but also not even delightfully odious as many of canty's short story characters are. Her boredom and restlessness is alive and seething; so much so that the reader inevitably begins to share such feelings as the novel stumbles past 300 pages toward an ending that neither shocks nor titillates, canty's hitherto trademark signatures."
3,Depressing but well written...,"I guess this just isn't ""my kind of book."" Depressing, unlikable characters, no matter how well written, made this tough going for me. While the author has an excellent writing style, the story and its protagonist left me cold."
5,The entire Bone Series-great for 10yr old boys who are reluctant readers,"My son never enjoyed reading until he discovered three series of books: The Wimpy Kid series, Captain Underpants series and now the Bone Series. There are nine books, and my son is presently reading number 5. He reads it on his own, for pleasure. It's tough finding books that capture his attention, so the Bone series is a winner!"
3,OK Collection of scifi stories,"The cover is misleading, this collection is more scifi conflict than military science fiction. Also, there are no new stories, just extended chapters of some of the best scifi and okay scifi stories around."
3,Title does not live up to its contents,"Despite what the title says, this book does not contain stories about the military, at least not the majority. There are only a few that I would consider to have a military feel to them. Of those few I would have to say that they do not fit under the title of ""The Best"", with the exception of ""Ender's Game"" by Orson Scott Card, which is a prime example of ""The Best"" in military science fiction. But if you want to read that story you can buy it separately as a full version. Overall this book did not meet my expectations. When I bought it I thought each story would be a work of art, but was very disappointed in its contents."
2,Mostly mediocre,"Unfortunately this colelction contains, mostly, the short versions of far better novels. We get an excerpt from ""The Forever war"" by Joe Haldeman and the proto-type short story on which Orson Scott Card's ""Ender's Game"" was based. In both cases I think the long versions are much better than this...The PKD story is also good however has been reprinted so many times I must have it 5x by now ^_^The only truly great short here is Walter Jon William's ""Wolf Time"", which is a short story set after his book ""Voice of the Whirlwind"".Overall I was pretty disappointed by this collection. I was hoping it would have some new voices or some older voices I'ld never heard of. Actually the intro mentions a book called ""Men in the Jungle"" by Norman Spinrad. I got that and it was the best thing to come out of this collection for me."
3,Too general to be called a Uriel book,"I am very disappointed and feeling ripped off. I love angels and am an angel reader. I thought Mr. Webster might have special knowledge since he wrote 4 books on major archangels-Michael, Uriel, Gabriel and Raphael. On the basis of this book, I won't get the others. I did not learn one new thing by reading this book and I can honestly say that, I am sorry Mr. Webster, I like to be a kind reviewer. I am hoping to resell this book immediately to an angel novice.The information is too general and talks around the subject. It gives information about chakras, oils, archangels-days of the week they are known for, Celtic names for times of the year, etc.I have read D. Virtue's information, books, cds, and oracle decks. I have found her work to be more informative and useful. For example, he claims Uriel likes the clear quartz crystal. In my humble opinion, all celestial beings do. Uriel in particular likes amber or works closely with that gemstone. So buyer beware."
5,GREAT FIT,I seen the same product selling for $35 and over. I got my waist cincher including shipping for $24 and some change. I wish they had other colors because I would purchase them all. I received it in the mail today at work and hat to put it on right away HAHAHA :-P
5,Wonderful!,"My children have been taking these vitamins for years and love them! I love the fact that they are whole foods vitamins. They love that they are gummi bears and know that they are good for them, too. We will continue to purchase them."
4,Rolling in the Swells,"Bill Veigele's latest book is a fictional account of a Patrol Craft and its crew operating in the Aleutian theater of WW2.His skillfull narative brought the smells of diesel and oil to my senses while reading. Though I did not suffer from the rolling of the ship or the pounding in the rough seas. The campaing in the northern Pacific Ocean was not as well covered in the news like the operations in the South Pacific. But it gives an insight of what our servicemen (sailors) had to put up with for more than a year away from family and familiar sights.It is a good reading to get an idea of the life of a sailor on a small ship during the war. No high drama, no overwhelming technology or verbage to understand. Just a straight forward story."
3,Disappointing,"Because I loved previous editions of this book, I bought this new edition in anticipation of a trip back to the fabulous state of Nevada. Despite my former enthusiasm for the book, I have to give this edition a less than glowing review, mainly because many of my favourite places in the state were deleted, in order to expand coverage of just about every casino in Las Vegas, Reno and Tahoe. It's still well-written, but no longer can we read about such enigmatic places as Jarbidge, Searchlight and many of the other friendly, quirky, off-the-beaten-track towns and villages that make Nevada such a wonderful place to explore. Therefore, real Nevada-philes may want to give it a miss and try to get hold of a copy of the previous edition."
3,Tend to run small.,"I normally wear size 8, but these shoes were too small. That is the risk you take when ordering shoes without trying them on! They were cute, and arrived very promptly, and I got my refund credited when I returned them,but I did end up paying $5 to post them back. I suggest getting a half size bigger if you are thinking of ordering from Flava Flav."
1,"Completely unwearable, bad design","The sole of this shoe is super hard and does not bend so it comes off your heel while walking. Took advice of previous reviewer and got a 1/2 size bigger than normal, but still very narrow toe. Not a comfortable or even remotely wearable shoe.Adorable though. Would make nice bookends.Also a bummer to pay shipping to return AND have a $6 fee deducted for returning to Solestruck. $12 lesson. Should've used Zappos where shipping and returns are free."
4,ms. georgia,"I thought I would try these as I always use the regular hanes. they are nice, good feel, but I still prefer the regular hanes."
4,Amazing Drink.,"This drink is absolutely great. It has less calories, sugars, and sodium than Pepsi or Coke products, plus it tastes great. My favorite is the clementine but I'm also partial to the blackberry and lime. It's not overly sweet and I think thats why I like it. If you're looking for an all natural, tasty drink, you've found it- Izze Sodas.The reason this review is 4 Stars is because the pricing here on Amazon is ridiculous. Aren't you supposed to get a deal when you buy by the case? I purchase an Izze everyday at work for $1.69... you do the math. I can literally buy more by purchasing them individually.So while this soda is spectacular, do yourself a favor and find a better price. C'mon Amazon."
3,Yellowstone 6 footprint,"The footprint works well as ground cover for the tent. It is light and easy to set up.If you want a ""porch"" to lay gear or a place to rest your shoes you are out of luck w/ the footprint because there is no over hang.Personally I have begun using the Yellowstone 6 footprint for my back packing tent and a large tarp for the Yellowstone 6 tent.It is a great footprint, but smaller then our needs."
5,"""There are some who call me...Tim?""","I am a collector, so the educational,fun and durability factors don't really apply. The detail on this figure is INCREDIBLE!!! A GREAT display piece!!"
5,Very sweet!,"Very cute, feel-good movie, totally worth watching. Of course, Hugh Dancy is adorable in it, and very spirited. The entire cast was well put together and everyone played off each other great."
3,Sweet movie,"I thought this movie was very cute, feel-good movie. I really love Hugh Dancy and his acting was very good. I gave the movie 3 stars because it was a little predictable. Same story line almost every movie has. over all it was enjoyable."
2,Hardly worth watching,"Boring. Predictable. Same story line almost every movie has. Boy loses girl, meets another that's unattainable except she is and they live happily every after."
5,Amazing Game!!,"The first time I played this game was back in 1999, when I was just 12 years old. I was immiedately hooked. It was frightening and addictive and an amazing game to play! When we moved, the game was lost and I had forgotten the name of the game. Just recently, I remembered that the game it was combined with was narrated by Tim Curry. I IMDBd the games he voiced, found the Frankenstein game and then Googled what game it was combined with. After 10 years of searching for this wonderfully addicting game, I finally found it here. I highly, highly recommend this game to anyone who loves scary mysteries about the majesties of wonderful Egypt."
4,Fits like the original,I used it on a BR-320 backpack blower and it fits just like the factory made filters for less money.
2,Not one shred of decency,Slow in developing. Outcome easily predictable. Would not recommend to anyone else. Gives very little insight into the thinking of the officers prior to execution of three.
1,...,"I got this cd for $3.00, and you're trying to sell it for $14.00? If you are thinking about buying this cd just go to FYE."
1,"Nice hype, no subjstance","An interesting title, for an interesting molecule. Too bad the supplement doesn't work in athletes. Too bad there is not direct science to supporty it. To bad each study examing the effects of d-Ribose come up empty - kind of like your wallet if you buy the produc or this book."
4,A Dose of Heavy Psych,Fairly solid compilation . Mostly unknown artists with the exception of Boston Tea Partie's hit track. Could do without the last 5 tracks being the appalling Firebirds. Worth a buy for collectors.
4,Overdose,"I agee with the previous reviewer. Great tracks can be found here, but the last six by the Firebirds are just awful."
5,If this is an overdose i must be a junkie,"Powered by love - says it all. Played lots of this album at my sixties party on the weekend. Had the floor filled in minutes with sweaty, gyrating girls and guys in groovy sixties clothes. Give the people what they want, i say"
4,Beat Pharmacy - Constant Pressure,"Beat Pharmacy'sConstant Pressurecontinues his unique take on dub techno and deep house, straddling both worlds with a good sense of balance. Though ""Club Dread"" feels more firmly in the house side, it still has a fun vibe to keep it spry. If you prefer dub in a more 'pure' form, you can't go wrong with ""Hot Spot Splash."" But the house influences predominate: ""Tangerine,"" for instance, has a warmth to it that suggests jazzhouse, and Ursula Rucker's vocals on ""Pieces"" lends an additional melodic note. ""Caramel"" emphasizes the dub in a big way, with a pseudo-African flute to highlight the roots element, while ""Worship"" suggests the Timewriter's classic track ""Skywritings."" But it's ""Velocity"" that brings the dub half and the house half together in harmony at last."
3,yeah... heard of 'em,Cadillac Walk was a hit in the Seattle area briefly in the late 80's. I think the harp player was from Seattle. Last I heard they were big in Europe. Saw them live at Bumbershoot opening for Robert Cray. Cadillac Walk is a great song- the rest of them are dumb.
2,1/4 in swivel for air tools,"Air Hose 360 Degree Swivel Connector - 1/4"" NPTThe product works as advertized. However, it did break after using on a roofing nailer at about 115 bundels of shingles. They just wear out. This is the only one I've ever used so don't know how it works againts another brands. Sure makes it eaiser then a straight connected hose."
5,Very good for the goal but needs an update/corrections page,"I got this book to prepare for a retest on 70-58. I found the book better in many ways than the MOC for Networking Essentials. I already have the CNA for Novell and am on the path to MCSE. The biggest problem with the book and the CD is that they need to fix the typos, errors and omissions that make the book a little touchy to use. The company site has updates on the Cram series but not the Prep series. I plan on buying the NT workstation Prep book as soon as it is available."
4,Just touching this book.....,"I am a contractor for IBM. I borrowed this book from a coworker on a fluke incident. I noticed that other professionals were giving me other than normal professional compliments. I decided that if just caring the book brings on this type of response, then heck, I may as well read it. I am ordering it now. I will let you know how it affects my professional and personal life later. Bernard, Hotlanta, Georgia"
2,DOA,"I spend top dollars for this piece of crap. Wanted something to save weight, and time, so I don't have to carry everything around with me to school. But it was DOA (Dead on arrival) Should have spend the money on a cheaper notebook cooler. But as always Amazon was there to the rescue. And Tiger-direct refunded my money the next day."
4,European power adapter,"I used the adapter to recharge camera and cell phone batteries and it worked very well. Since most charges can handle both US and European power systems, no converter is needed - just the adapter."
2,"False advertisement, i.e. ""Continental Europe""","The product allegedly works all over Continental Europe, with a long list of qualifying countries, including Austria, given in the description. But when I took this adapter plug to Europe, it did not fit the outlet designs at my hotels in Salzburg or Vienna. It also failed in Prague--I'll let that slide, however, since the Czech Republic wasn't specifically advertised. Worked like a charm in Venice, though!"
1,Not right,"I purchased this adapter plug specifically because it was described as ""polarized"" and therefore would accept American plugs with one prong wider than the other. The two slots in this plug are identical in size and do not accept the wider prong on the American plugs. The plug delivered also does not resemble the photograph on Amazon."
1,Not polarized,"I ordered two of these because I needed an adapter that fit an American polarized plug. Despite what the description says, this is NOT polarized. I was very disappointed and had to return them, because they won't work for what I need."
4,Adapter Plug - great product,"It is a great product. I initially returned it, because it is a very snug fit with the American outlet, but the seller was very professional and communicated with me and the issue was resolved."
4,adapter plug - good product,"This is a simple adapter. It worked great in Ukraine and Israel. It is not bulky. I found no need during 24 days of travel for the many multi-adapters that I reviewed and considered pruchasing. It worked in a variety of places from airports, trains to numerous motels to apartments. There was not a place in my travels that this did not work. Simple is better.The shipping was pricy and more than advertised. However when I brought this to the attention of the company they refunded the overage promptly.A simple product that worked very well."
5,The Best,I use this plug for my laptop and it fits perfectly. I love it because it is small and compact. Can't ask for more.
5,Really great product!,"It was great! Perfect size, great prize and it arrived after just a few days. I recently went to Europe and I brought it everywhere. Really great product!"
1,unusable,This adapter does NOT have the larger prong input that US plugs have---both sides are small. Can't use it for anthing I own. Apparently I didn't understand what I was buying.
5,One of His Best,"It took me 15 years but I finally did it. I finished reading ""The Coup"" this week and that means I have read all of Updike's published novels and short story collections. I'm no expert but this one has got to be one of his best. All the usual Updike elements are there: flawless prose, ""tragicomic"" situations (emphasis on ""comic"" in this book), character development, and the pace is just right. The scene where the protaganist meets the parents of his American girl friend is simply hilarious. If you're a fan and haven't read ""The Coup"" you're definitely missing out. I highly recommend it."
2,Not that good,This book is filled with a lot of errors. The storyline was okay but good be better.Wasn't worth the money.
1,MARRIED TO THE GAME,"I REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK. I THOUGHT THAT SHE TOOK HER A LIITLE TO FAR. SHE IS MISSING WITH HER MANS (WHO IS DEAD) BROTHER AND NEPHEW; NOW THATS NASTY. I REALLY LIKE THE ARTIST SO, I FORWARD TO HER FUTURE WORK."
4,Real good book,"This is a must read. Damn, I know I cold never live this life. But its good to read about it."
2,what a waste!,"this book was interesting to say the least,book 1(a gangsters girl) was way better, in this book ceazia seems too out there. you felt sorry for her in book 1 because of what vegas did to her but in book 2 she turned out to be the bad chick and she seemed to be kinda on the gay side!even the ending was horrible!the new characters in the book didnt even make the book better it made it more of a mess! ceazia went from being a wanna-be diva in book 1 to a bi-sexual gold-digger who couldn't be trusted and did nothin but scheme people into gettin what she wanted.ceazia should've had a happier ending in this book not one that left possiblity to another sequel. this book was a poor excuse of a sequel and i want my money back!!!"
3,Who's got the Juice,"After the death of Vegas, C, is back on the grind. Her body is seductive and can make the youngest soldier go against his family just to get a whiff.Since the death of his brother, Vegas, Snake has taken it upon himself to teach his lil' solder the game. With beef on the streets, Snake may end up where his brother left off.Duke has grown up looking up to his two uncles, Snake and Vegas. Now a man, has Duke forgotten death before dishonor?If you like Chunichi you will like this read. For some reason when I read this along with its predecessor, A Gangster's Girl, I felt like turning on 50 cent's song ""Wangster."""
4,good follow up,Chunichi did a good job keeping the story going. At first I was a lil confused but it all came together. The back cover or somewhere should have said what book she was following. When U read so many books that are all very similar you forget who is who. any way good job looking forward to more from this author.
5,Married to the Game,"The continuation from A Gangsta's Girl, Married to the Game was a very good book. I only wish it could have ended differently."
3,Ok what's next?,"It seems that Ceazia's plot proved successful but I smell a part 3 coming on. This ended to abrupt and I felt that there should be more of a storyline about BJ and possible revenge??? I guess I'm petty but $100,000.00 doesn't seem like enough to get away with and be able to live off of. What will Ceazia do next? More details please."
5,Thank you for keeping it gangsta!!!,"Married to the Game was excellent!! I read A Gangster's Girl and I have to say, that I really felt bad when Vegas began to lose his faithfullness to C. But C took the cake in Married to the Game. I guess all that time in jail and Vegas being disloyal really changed her.Please get that third book out. I will continue to be a faithful reader of your work Chunichi!! Thank you for giving me so much drama. You are the BEST!!!"
3,I enjoyed it,"This was a very quick read for me and that means that I enjoyed this book. Almost a little ""too fast"" though. Lots and lots of drama, sex, no good brothas, and scheming sistas!"
4,Marshall Arisman's Gold,"Great book! The Cat Who Invented Bebop is a humorous story and well illustrated book. If you like Marshall Arisman's art, this book is a must have!"
5,Helen understand kids,"If there is one person on the planet who understands the relationship between kids and their toys it's Dr. Helen Boehm. This book is a MUST read for parents, grandparents or anyone looking for the right gift for kids of any age."
5,ChicagoMom,"I can't say enough about pediped shoes. They are not only adorable, but they also stay on and my daughter loves them. Plus, they are easier to get on than all of the other infant shoes I've tried. They really are the next best thing to bare feet!"
4,Back in the Day,"This ""just the facts ma'am"" book chronicles a fascinating time when songwriting made the leap from tin pan alley sentimentality to sophisticated pop (hard to believe they called it rock and roll!) with many fascinating personalities and future pop stars. If early rock and roll history is your bag, dude, then this is fun, well researched book."
2,"Great Book, Especially if you hate white people","This could have been a really great, definitive book. Unfortunately, the author is a stereotypical academic firing off the stereotypical insults to all that awful white folks' music. You'll be reading along, enjoying yourself, and bam, you're suckerpunched by a really snotty sneer at one of the records you've loved all your life, because it's (insert here one of the standard academic insults to white folks' music).And you'll get suckerpunched again and again. Chapter Eight is almost a racist tirade.If there were a service that removes all this attitude from these kinds of books, and this kind of attitude is typical of these kinds of books, I'd subscribe to the service. If you don't mind it, or you hate white music yourself, this is a good book.And you know, this book is -about- people who are white. Imagine that."
5,The Brilliance Indeed,"This incredible book reveals the ""bomp and brilliance of the Brill Building era."" And what a good job it does at that! With a roughly chronological pattern, it covers the trials and travails of such great songwriting teams as Ellie Greenwich and Jeff Barry, Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann, Carole King and Gerry Goffin, Burt Bacharach and Hal David, and the classic geniuses who started the era of writing for girl groups (although they did more than that), Doc Pomus with Mort Shuman and Jerry Leiber with Mike Stoller.Here are all the inside stories you'd ever want to know. It's like reading Alan Betrock's classic ""Girl Groups: the Story of a Sound"" only hearing about it from the other side of the Brill Building--and this book has more detail and nuance.Even though the book might seem centered on songwriters, it's truly a blend of stories about the talent, writers, producers and others who contributed to this magic oeuvre we all love called 1960s girl-group music."
4,Very detailed account of early rock music,"The amount of detail in this book is amazing. Not for the casual music listener, but great for those of us who grew up in the golden age of rock and roll. This book fills in many of the blanks for us hard core music fans who want to know the stories behind the songs."
5,Best book ever,This is a great book. I think everyone should read it! Boba Fett is awesome! All hail Mandalor! Bob's Fett!
4,Boba Fett: A Practical Man,"This is a nice story about the Mandalorians at the time of the Yuzong Vong war beginning. Karen provided some great details into the inner workings of the Mandalorians of that time, and some inner workings of the Yuzong Vong that we did not see in that series."
2,Boba fett a unfinshed story,This book had one chapter with no detail .I already knew it was going to be short but this story is the shortest story I ever read. I don't recomend this book.
5,Sad but true.,"Reading this was bitter sweet. I had long enjoyed and adored Karen Traviss Mandaloran stories. Finally getting this was one was exciting (I had recently bought a kindle, and reading books on a laptop had felt terribly wrong). Knowing it would be the last of her writing about my favorite parts of the Star wars universe tempered it.While not an overly long story it wonderfully summed up all that I loved about the culture and characters she had created. You get a truly good look at what kind of man Boba Fett is and the lengths he'll go to get the job done. Not everyone wants to read about an all powerful wizardly type of character. Some love the tough, buckle down and stay the course types. Karen writes for the fan boys who appreciate that not all of us want to be the hero, some of realize you got to be practical just like Fett."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This story absolutely sucked. Just when you get used to the weird writing style, the story JUST gets interesting and it's over in what feels like the middle of the story. The worst part is the Kindle edition makes it appear like your only 2/3 of the way through because of that annoying thing they use on the bottom of the screen to show what ""page"" your on (i.e.- 1035 of 2500...who designed that?!?). The rest of the content is some lame and boring story about a Clone Trooper and some other uninteresting crap....YAY!!! I want my $2 and the hour it took to read back."
4,Gotta love Boba,"How can you beat Boba Fett? Seriously, no surprises exactly, but who cares? It's Boba, he shoots stuff, and is just plain bada$$. How can you go wrong?"
4,Love Boba,I love Karen Traviss books. She is a great military style writer. Another great book about mandos. She was the best thing to happen to the Star Wars line and me and my boys all have read her Republic Commandos books. Check those out if you Haven't yet.
5,Great book for fig lovers,"This is a great book when you can get your hands on fresh figs or better... grow them yourself. Marie Simmons enthusiasm can be felt throughout this book. Nevertheless it is still a usefull cookbook as well containing 70 recipes, the vast majority are simple to cook and delicious. I have created a website on figs (in Dutch) www.vijg.nl and this is a great resource for additional information on this wonderful fruit. Highly recommended!"
5,Must Own Title if you Own a Fig Tree,"This is a luscious book. We moved to a new home and there's a fig tree in my backyard. I've never eaten fig outside of a newton, but I like newtons, so I ""fig""ured I should learn about Figs! Besides lots of amazing recipes (like grilling figs!) there's lots of fig information, background, history, etc. that makes me really glad I've got a fig tree and even gladder I found this book. As of this writing, my first fig crop has yet to ripen....oh do hurry, I can't wait to put this book to work!"
2,Deloghi Carafe,"This is the same one that I bought with the coffee maker,. The one thing that makes it undesirable, is that the picture of the carafe was shown in the white, and when I opened the box, lo and behold, the carafe was the black one. I am satisfied that I do not have to drink cold coffee while using a carafe from a different maker, but I would have loved to have the white carafe which I was expecting to see."
4,"OK, but not ok","I thought it would have been bigger, but it barely covers my over head space in my rack out here in Afghanistan."
1,Not like the 13 pc Bosch Sweden Bits,"I have a 13 pc bosch cobalt bit set that has been incredible. Drills straight holes and has no run out or uneven flutes. I decided to but the 29 pcs set because I allowed co-workers to use my bits and they broke 3 of them and mis-used the others by running too fast. I was so impressed I bought anything with with Bosch name and cobalt label. THIS IS NOT FROM THE SAME FACTORY. The bits found in the 13 pc set are very high quality and run true and cut very well. The new 29 pc bit set is from China and are not true, do not cut as well as the other set and are clearly not of the same quality. I am very dissapointed and was ready to buy Bosch bits the rest of my life. At this point I am waiting to see if I can find bits of the same quality."
2,Made in China,"Be advised that these drills, although bearing the Bosch brand name, are actually made in China according to the label on the case."
1,Can't be worse (in this planet),"Everybody knows Ibrahim Tatlises is the biggest depthless singer I've ever seen in my entire life, his voice and sound is so eastern,simple,shallow and arabic good for the eastren sounded people not for the ones like me"
1,Total Recall: How to Boost Your Memory Power,"Sorry, but this is the worst book on memory I have ever read. You have to drag yourself through 200 pages of scientific studies, university tests, and theories before any practical advice for memory retention is discussed. And then when it is discussed, it's not very specific, has very few examples, and is covers a very narrow range. I wanted extremely specific and practical instructions on a very wide spectrum. This book didn't have that. So far, I've never found any author better than Harry Lorayne."
3,The proper title for this book should be...,"the reasons we choose to forget. This book is valuable in that it teaches you why you don't have total recall. It explains how to overcome the mental and emotional roadblocks to a perfect memory, as well as the reasons why we may not want one. Well worth the reading."
1,aquamarine ring,It was a very pretty ring. Its stone stood out really far and it caught on everything I touched. The ring lasted two days and I noticed that the stone was gone. A total waste of money.
2,Traditional Softcore,"These shows are all the same, but the story in this one is cute, I guess. Not my favorite theme. The girl is smoking, though."
3,Older title. I ordered to check it out.,Older title. I didn't really desire it- just wanted to see what it was.That's all I have to offer.
2,Story is neat......but no illustrations,"Very disappointed in this book, as it was to have 16 illustrations,as well as other pictures. No illustrations. Gave it a 2, because the story is good and appropriate for children,but I have removed from my active book list for kids I share with."
1,Recycled Truisms,"While it is good to forgive and have an attitude of gratitude, I didn't get a lot out of this one. You might be better off reading the seven habits of highly effective people about sharpening the axe and then going to church."
5,An inspirating book,The Daily Six is a roadmap to personal freedom. This book pin points what it takes to be a true success and clearly distinguishes the components in our lives that keep us from being as completely happy and successful as we should be. His book reveals just how truly simplistic life is and how you can be your best...read the book! He also makes a great motivational speaker. I heard him speak and he delivered such an inspiring message that I had to read his book.
5,A Simple Solution,"Unlike most other self help books, this one keeps it simple and doable. I recommend this guide to help in the business world as well as in personal relationships. It's obvous it was written from the heart and it works on many levels."
5,Wow!,"I have read many professional improvement books. However, The Daily Six taps into something I have yet to find in other books--Chappelear, through his personal experience, creates an ""A ha"" moment for the reader! I realized: I can apply these simple tenants to my daily life.Thanks, John!"
4,A Good Glossary for Studying Atomic and Quantum Physics,"Atkins has written an alternative approach to revealing quantum physics, using no math, pictorial representations, and concise explanations, while still containing the common equations and formulas (in easy referenced boxed figures); he has offered a fresh text, in the style of a dictioanry, which is a good reference for a student and a practical handbook for the practitioner or teacher. This is a good (and much needed) addition to the pedagogy in the field. But, it could have been even better if; it had more material on Nuclear and Solid State physics, substituted the questions (found after each definition) for examples and/or worked out problems, and included a quick refernce by catagory."
5,God Scent is God Sent,"This not just another devotional with aphorisms to salve the wayward believer. Rather it is a beautiful, articulate and sensitive piece of work by an author who shares himself in a no-nonsense manner such that he challenges and shepherds the reader to an expanded connection with God. It is a wonderful book written by a very loving and humble Christian who through sharing his life openly, nudges us closeer to God. Thank you.Tom & Bobbie Merrillco-authors ""Settle For More: You Can Have the Relationshiop You Always Wanted...Guaranteed!"""
4,Decent drill bits,I have purchased Bosch drill bits before and they were good quality so I ordered this set. I haven't used them yet but wanted to let others know that these bits are made in China. The plastic case is made in the USA. Other Bosch drill bits are not made in China. I hpoe these are of the same quality.
4,aggressive.,"These bits chew through metal. What do the reviewers mean by aggressive? To me, it means I have a hard time centering the bit and then it goes too fast, a bit grabby, so you have to be careful of the torque twisting your wrist; too much of a good thing."
3,Too much repetition,"I wished there were a bit more variety in this DVD. It was great the first few times, and then I found myself yearing for a class where there might be a surprise or two thrown in. I've done workout dvds for years but this is the first where I felt bored after the first few times."
3,Lunges get boring after a while,"This yoga dvd is fine a few times, but the repetition of so many lunges is boring after a few workouts. I would have liked a bit more variety. I own both her pre-natal yoga dvds and my comment would be the same for the other one as well."
4,"Finally, Yoga Flow for Pregnancy!","I've been practicing yoga on and off for over 13 years. My background is in Ashtanga Warrior Yoga, and I thought I would have to stay away from any sort of power yoga during pregnancy. I was so happy to find this DVD! Most other DVDs are very light and while they are nice for stretching, I didn't feel I got a complete workout.I would definitely recommend this DVD set. I have not used the Short Forms DVD yet, but am looking forward to it. My only critique would be that it was sometimes hard to follow some of the poses because it was either too zoomed in, or focusing on one trimester while not showing all models and modifications on camera. I think once I watch it again and pause appropriately until I guarantee my form is right, it will make up for this.Overall a great DVD that shows wonderful modifications to a more flowing yoga and a safe version of sun salutations."
5,Great prenatal yoga DVD,The 3 different programs of this DVD help make it great. I do the long one (45 min) on the weekends and the shorter programs (15 or 30 min) during the week when there isn't as much time. I also found myself sleeping MUCH better on days when I did yoga. Easy to follow too for someone like myself who is still somewhat of a beginner.
2,Too long and boring,"The workout is way too long and boring also is an advance level, so if you are a beginer and pregnant I wouldn't try it. I am an active person I swim 3/4 of mile 3 times a week and I didn't feel well after doing the workout it seem to be too much effort if you are pregnant and haven't practice yoga. Sheva Rea's prenatal is excellent I loved it, it is relaxing and easy to follow also perfect for advance or beginers levels."
4,Excellent Prenatal Yoga DVD,The DVD is amazing.It's fun to do. It's so great to do as a start to the day or even as a nice end of the day workout. It feels great to stretch and relax. Before you start yoga practice or any fitness program talk to your doctor first. Enjoy your DVD.
5,very happy with this DVD,"I purchased this DVD when I was about 3 months along in my pregnancy. I am young and healthy and have been practicing yoga on & off for years. I wanted something that was challenging & would allow me to break a sweat, while still enjoying the standard benefits of yoga. I feel this DVD met all those requirements. I particularly appreciate that I can choose the length of my session (15, 30, 45, or 75 minutes) and the partner poses. The partner poses are beautiful, something I've not encountered anywhere else. Partner poses feel particularly special as they include my boyfriend in this process while preparing us both for labor. Lastly, I live in a climate that has cold, long winters, so I liked that I could do the DVD when I couldn't exercise outside & still feel like I got a workout."
4,Helpful,Great video that differentiates by trimester. You not have to be an experienced yogi to follow along but correct posture for basic poses is not explained. Still doing it at 34 weeks.
5,Perfect for regular yoga peeps,Before I was prego I did yoga at least once a day... either 15 minutes or for 1 hour. This 1 hour version is a great strong workout for someone who is prego. 1st trimester... this will be too easy for you if you do yoga all the time. I just did my regular yoga during the 1st tri and I was fine. 2nd tri... this starts to work wonders in the aread where your belly is getting stretched. Not in my 3rd quite yet... but this is the perfect DVD to keep me at peace and stretched out.Perfect for prego peeps
5,I love these DVDs!,I received my copy of Complete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD Set a few weeks ago and I love it! I practiced yoga for a few years before I got pregnant and I was having a hard time finding something that was challenging enough but still felt comfortable with my changing body.Complete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD Set strikes the perfect balance. I feel great after each practice but not too tired and never sore - even though I'm not as in shape as I was before.I also love that she gives tips on helpful poses/movements that may help during labor and has a section on practicing with your partner.I highly recommend Complete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD Set. I will probably continue to use it without the modifications after I have the baby.
2,Prenatal Yoga,"I purchased this in my second trimester. I had no idea which prenatal yoga video to purchase so I read reviews and chose this one. I have had moderate yoga experience and love yoga in general.This video does not bring me the same joy in doing yoga as usual. It is too long and monotonous, I cannot seem to get through it in one sitting. Not because of fatigue but because of boredom. It is unfortunate that I did not buy another video, although I'm still not sure which video would suite me best. Hard to make good decisions with no previews online."
2,Too difficult and repetitive,"I take a vinyasa yoga class 1 day per week and really enjoy it so I thought this dvd would be perfect. It is way too difficult, especially for pregnant women. I am in my first trimester and I couldn't keep up just because I can't breathe as quickly anymore (more oxygen to the baby than the mommy). Also, she did lunges for the first 40 minutes. The dvd is so repetitive it get boring quickly. When it finally got interesting again at about an hour I was so out of focus I couldn't get back to my practice. The dvd is way to long for the variety of poses. The woman in her third trimester actually looks uncomfortable practicing and I know there is no way I could do this video in my third trimester without a lot of practice. The camera work is also unprofessional."
3,repetitive but pleasant,"My usual complaints with exercise videos in general are that the instructors are annoying and the music is terrible. This one has great music, subtle and in the background and Jennifer is a pleasant instructor that doesn't annoy me with the exception of the Relaxation segment. Most yoga videos have a brief relaxation section. This one is lengthy and good except Jennifer talks the whole time, repeating the same phrases. My other complaint is that this is a repetitive program. Maybe that's standard within the Vinyasa style, I'm used to Hatha. It was the same lunge, down dog, add slight variation over and over again.It was more challenging than those other pregnancy tapes that don't increase your heart rate but as someone who has done yoga on and off for many years but has never progressed passed a competent beginner it was a good fit for me. I'll need to work up to doing the whole program though.So, fine for beginners and good for people with more stamina as well."
5,A must for prenatal care!,I'm currently pregnant with my second child and love the flexibility of doing this at home. This is not only a great workout but has great information about pregnancy and the changes in your body. The modifications presented make it accessible for all stages of pregnancy and post-partum. Jennifer Wolfe's style and cadence are phenomenal. The partner and relaxation sections can be done on their own for a quick fix. Thank you for filling an unmet need!
1,Boring!,"Yes, this is challenging, if you like lunges. BORING is the one word that kept coming to mind as I just tried to give this DVD a second chance. She repeats and repeats the moves especially the lunges. YUK. One of the features I love so much about Yoga is the movement to a variety of different moves, this one just made me bored and frustrated.I dont recommend."
5,Great for those experienced with yoga,"Only prenatal video that I've found that gives a good and relaxing workout. Probably not for beginners or anyone too out of shape, but great for others!"
5,Good for experienced yoginis,"I have been practicing for awhile and was frustrated at how slow the prenatal classes I've attended have been. This DVD has some great practices, and I do think you could handle it if you're in good shape, or have been practicing a year. It gets into some really good poses for pregnancy (squats, upper body strengthening) and the series is nicely paced and arranged. I like the options for the different length of practices too.The only think I don't like about it is the music. I wish I could turn it off, but there is no option to do that."
5,AWESOME,"This dvd is amazing.I must say, FINALLY, a vinyasa Prenatal dvd. I have seen so many simple, basic yoga dvds for the pregnant woman. Those of you that have practiced yoga pre=pregnancy, will love this dvd. Hey those of you that are not pregnant will also benefit greatly from this dvd. And I must say, those new to yoga, pregnant or not, will LOVE this videoLike many great yoga teachers/workouts... This encouranges all levels, and listening to YOUR BODY.. .Going where you want to go.It allows those that want to move and groove to GO THERE, and those that are newer or backing off, to chill and go within, andfeel great~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`` and shine your light BRIGHT!Thank you for bringing this DVD to me.btw Doug Swenson had Jennifer Wolfe have some fabulous partner yoga, to enjoy with a friend/child/or coworker ;-)"
2,Wasn't the right fit for me,"This was the first prenatal yoga dvd I purchased. Prior to pregnancy, Ashtanga was my preferred practice. I was excited that this dvd was Vinyasa with short forms making it flexible for anyone's schedule. I had high hopes given the amount of reviews and average star rating. I did this dvd about once a week for my entire first trimester. I kept thinking eventually I'd like it- until one morning I decided I had enough! I find the studio that this dvd was filmed in to be depressing and I really dislike some of the facial features the instructor would make. I didn't find the poses in this dvd to be challenging or relaxing but definitely redundant. Just wasn't the right dvd for me!"
5,Super Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga,"As a Vinyasa Flow Yoga Teacher, i think this is a fantastic Prenatal DVD. I was getting bored attending Prenatal Yoga classes, as they were very simple and mainly for beginners (as a lot of women only decide to start practicing yoga when they fall pregnant). If you have had some experience in yoga, this DVD is super! For those who are beginners, there is also the 15 minute short form which you can start off with and slowly build your practice. The modifications and explanations for each trimester are very clear and helpful. So, whether you're a beginner or an experienced yogi, i would recommend this DVD to you!"
3,Level of Difficulty,"If one is in prime shape and very flexible, this video is good. The programs are too long and very difficult for the regular Jane."
3,Good prenatal yoga routine but poorly knees!,"Overall I enjoyed this prenatal yoga DVD. It's pretty challenging in parts and you certainly feel like you've had a good stretch and a good workout. The instructor explains the poses very well and also explains the benefits. The only problem I found was that it required a lot of kneeling and my knees got really sore. The only way i could do the workout was to put a thick blanket under my knees everytime I needed to kneel. The sun salutations were modified so that each time you moved through a vinyasa, you lunged with one knee on the floor so it was quite repetetive.Overall, one of the better yoga DVD's for pregnancy!"
2,Too Fast and Intense,"I have several other prenatal yoga DVDs, and was looking for something a little tougher to challenge myself. This DVD is way too fast - there is no reminding you to breathe - and way too intense for a normal pregnant person (even the short forms). I am 33 yrs old, active every day, and have been doing yoga for 8 yrs. This DVD doesn't try to connect you to your pregnancy and get a workout with modifications for pregnancy, it seems to factor your pregnancy in as a ""minor inconvenience"" to a really intense yoga practice. Elena Brower's Prenatal and Postnatal Yoga is much better. This DVD was harder than a lot of regular yoga classes I've attended. Boo!"
2,Not worth it - just modify your regular yoga workout,"I was looking for something really specific to prenatal, and didn't feel there was enough in this - I felt like this could've been any yoga workout. I recommend Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga instead. Some of the reviews I've read stated that this was a harder workout than Shiva's, which is true, however, I would much rather just apply modifications to my Rodney Yee Power Yoga series (which I love) than do this. I find this instructor and music distracting, actually almost annoying, and have never been interested enough to complete the full 75 minute program. I always find myself stopping early or fast forwarding though the workouts. On the other hand, I find Shiva's (and Rodney's) programs to fly by and I am done before I know it."
3,Good workout for some,"My wife tried out this workout, but she has weak wrists and many of the exercises have you put some of your body weight on your wrists and then roll them. The rest of the exercises were very good though. If you want something that's easier on your joints, she recommends pregnancy Pilates."
2,Beginner Beware!!!!!!!!,"I am very upset that I purchased this video. After reading all the fantastic reviews, I thought for sure this would be a great DVD for me. I am currently 18 weeks, and am fit. I used to exercise quite regularly and do some yoga prior to get pregnant. I figured that this yoga would be challenging but still ""do-able"" I find myself ""huffing and puffing"" at every breath. In the beginning of the series it clearly states that you should be doing this particular form of yoga practice for at least 3 mos prior to use of this DVD. I wish i had known this before i purchased this. I don't think there is anything particularly wrong with this practice, im sure the yoga itself is great for someone who can handle this pace. I couldn't. My asthma has even acted up after using this DVD. I am more upset at all the reviews over this than I am at the actual DVD. I wasted $22 buying this, and now I am stuck with it!NOT FOR THE BEGINNER AT ALL!"
1,Not what I expected,"I bought this DVD after reading the reviews because I wante something a little more challenging than the Shiva Rea Prenatal Yoga DVD I had. I tried to go through the 15 minute short form and just gave up and decided I'm returning this. The movements are way too fast, I don't even have time to figure out what to do before they are doing something else. Also, the music and quality of the film is poor. I'm not a beginner to yoga so I thought I would be fine, but I was wrong, it's way too fast. I am back using my other DVD and I'm okay with that."
5,Great DVD!!,"I love this DVD. Not too easy, not too hard, just right. I am 7 months and practice every other day."
4,Prenatal yoga,"Good variety of poses. I mainly used the DVD with the shorter workouts. The instructor spoke slowly and clearly, which was helpful when not looking at the screen"
2,Caused Abdominal Distress for Days,"I have been practicing yoga for 10+ years, and this is one of my least favorite DVDs to date. First the set is awful. It looks like it must be in one of the girls' basements. The clothing is kinda... sloppy and doesn't match. I know I shouldn't care about that kind of stuff, and if the workout was stellar, I could overlook it. But the workout is simply not fit for a pregnant woman. There are too many poses that put a considerable amount of strain on the core. Consequently, I was felt overstretched (and nervous) after only 45 minutes of the laborious, tedious, and downright boring video. How the instructor managed to make a difficult workout so boring I will never figure out. As I sit here, I'm still nervous about the way my stomach is feeling. Wish I had never done this workout!!"
5,Not too shabby.,I feel better after each workout and glad that I purchased it. I have no regrets and I like how the instructor explains each move.
5,Love this practice,"This is something I really enjoy and would recommend to other. This DVD is definitely for me! If you are not prepared, you may do 15 or 30 minutes practices, which are relatively easy."
3,Yoga on the Highway,"I ordered this Yoga video along with another (Shiva Rea)prenatal DVD. I feel that out of the two, this is definately the more challenging workout, more like a regular yoga fitness class. However, I have one major complaint with this recording: I feel like it was made in someone's apartment next to a highway! I was distracted throughout the video by the almost constant sound of trucks and cars zooming by in the background. Seriously, could they not have done some sound editing? The music is almost non-existent, which is fine, except that instead I find myself listening to the sound of traffic in the background. Very bizarre, I can't believe that they released it this way."
5,Exactly What I Was Looking For,"I purchased 2 prenatal yoga DVD's this one and Shiva Rae'sPrenatal Yoga. Here is my comparison:Shiva Rae Prenatal Yoga: I like that it has 3 women, one for each trimester but I honestly can't imagine ever needing to modify as much as the third trimester woman does (she uses a chair in some cases) I use this DVD on days when I want a VERY gentle practice which is not that often.Complete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga by Jennifer Wolfe: I have found that I use this DVD almost every day since it also has 3 models, one for each trimester and it has 15, 30, 45 and 75 minute routines plus labor poses and a partner section (which my partner actually does with me!). I love this DVD. The best part is that Jennifer is a doula and childbirth professional so I feel really safe while maintaining my strength and flexibility. This is like a regular vinyasa class, just modified for pregnancy."
5,Great Prenatal Yoga DVD,"This is a great DVD for people who have been doing Vinyasa Yoga or Power Yoga. It's definitely a bit of a challenge and it's very convenient to have the choice between a 15, 30 or 45 minute session."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for prenatal yoga dvds at the recommendation of my doctor, who said that I shouldn't attend my usual hot vinyasa classes during pregnancy. I ordered this one based on the reviews and had pretty high expectations. What a disappointment! The production was terrible - looks like it was shot on a handheld camera in someone's living room, too many closeups and bad angles (instead of showing good views of some of the poses). I could have somewhat overlooked that if I found the routines whatsoever challenging, but I didn't. I should note, though, that I've been practicing hot power yoga for about 8 years and don't often come across videos that I do find as challenging as a good class. For now, I'll stick to my favorite free podcasts rather than risk wasting any more money on dvds."
3,a bit too much for beginners,I purchased both this one and the one by Shiva Rea. I have had some prior yoga experience but not much. I found this dvd a bit challenging and monotonous. They spend a lot of time on 3-4 poses that certainly give you a work out but if you are somewhat new to this and trying to exercise a bit while pregnant I think you might be better off with something more mellow like prenatal yoga with Shiva Rea
3,MIxed feelings,"Well,I really don't know what to rate this product.Sometimes during your pregnancy,you feel so tired heavy and out of shape so you try to follow this Dvd's excercises but you get so intimidated...they are not easy unless you used to do yoga before (which I was but not that often)and they are long...there are no breaks for a whole hour(of course you can pause the DVD and take a break but I prefer a smooth stop or break besides going through the hassel of forwarding and rewinding if u want to resume the excercise the next day).On the other hand,some days especially when I started following this DVD on an almost daily basis..it became more fun and I felt the difference in my flexibility.I do recommend this DVD but I just want to warn you not to push yourself in the beginning."
3,Too Difficult for Beginners,"I was pretty dissapointed with this yoga workout. I am somewhere between a beginner and intermediate level yogini and I was expecting to be able to modify to a level I could work with. This was a lot harder than I thought.The biggest problem for me is I have very weak shoulders and cannot spend a lot of time in positions like downward dog. It seemed like half the workout was spent in downward dog and it was just too much and difficult to modify to something I could work with.If you're a lot more advanced, and don't have weak shoulders, then this would probably be good. If you're a beginner or not very flexible you should get something else."
2,Returning Item,I am returning this video. I practiced yoga for several years prior to becoming pregnant. I tried the 75 minute and 30 minute practice. The instructor moves through poses way too fast that with a 2nd trimester belly I was afraid to loose balance. I did not enjoy it at all.
5,Great video!!,"I have done Yoga a lot in the past, but would not say that I am a master by any means and this video is perfect for me! I feel stronger and more flexible every time I do it. I have had experiences where prenatal yoga videos were just too darn easy and boring, and was thrilled to find this one more challenging. I can tell it is going to strengthen my lower body, which will hopefully be helpful for labor and delivery. I highly recommend this DVD, you can always skip parts or pause it if you need a break or find something uncomfortable as the video says."
2,what a disappointment,"I am an experienced yogi, though I still think some of the exercises on this DVD is not very safe to do during pregnancy. Besides being designed for pregnancy as it claims, the DVD is really nothing special. There are a lot much better Vinyasa type Yoga DVDs on the market for regular exercise purposes. What bothers me most is the poor production quality, and the awful background music which drones and irritates my nerves."
4,perfect for women who are good at yoga!,"i really like this prenatal yoga video. it did take me a while to find that the shorter 15, 30, 45 min versions were on the 2nd dvd. the 1st dvd had the hour long version. now that i know where the shorter workouts are i will do this video more. i live in nyc and used to go to jivamukti classes at union square which are very vigorous and challenging. i am pretty good at yoga so this video is perfect for me, but like others said it's not really good if you aren't good or experienced at yoga. i highly recommend!!! i am 37 weeks and i like the 30 min version a lot."
4,prenatal for serious yoga practitioners,"This has been a wonderful DVD for me! I feel like I've really had a yoga workout with this DVD, even at 19 weeks pregnant. The other prenatal DVD's I've tried have been so weak and useless. This DVD has wonderful modifications for second and third trimester and emphasizes the basic premise of yoga to only do what your body can that day. I feel like I've gotten a hard workout (really works my legs), but by the end I feel so refreshed and relaxed and vibrant. Jennifer's voice is soothing and calm as she guides the poses. This is a DVD for women who have experience with yoga and already have a basic idea of the regular poses - okay for beginners but not for true novices!"
2,uncomfortable not pregnancy oriented,"If you love vinyasa flow yoga and are already practicing it, this may be good. It really is the same as regular vinyasa except that your belly is an obstacle for the regular flow. I didn't like it, I thought it was awkward, getting into a standing lunge from cat pulled a ligament in my lower stomach and that's done over and over. I wish it were more pregnancy oriented. I gave it two stars because I think the partner yoga section could be nice, I haven't tried it."
2,First Impersonator,This is a good look into the small world of celebrity impersonators. It's a different kind of movie but O K for what it is. I was dissapointed that there was very little of Vaughn Meader's performance of Kennedy. The man was talented but somewhat of a space cadet.
4,BETTER TO KNOW THAN NOT!,I WAS PLEASED WITH THE VERY PROFESSIONAL AND COMPETENT SERVICE I RECEIVED PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT. MOVIE WAS WELL DONE AND FILLED IN DETAILS RE MORMON HISTORY I DID NOT RECEIVE IN MY HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE EDUCATION. THANKS TO ALL INVOLVED IN MAKING THE DOCUMENTARY AND IN PROVIDING IT TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.
1,Book Club gone wild!!!!!!,"This book was the topic of our book club. One of our members had read it; and, recommended that we read it. The women in the book club was absolutely flabbergasted by the comments in this book. It was not indicative of black women as a whole!!!!! The men in the group praised it, of course!!!! It gave them justification for their wrongdoing. I was in total disagreement with this book and it was a typical Nation of Islam book."
3,An entertaining general introduction,"Essoe's loving collection of Tarzan film lore from the silent teens through the technicolor '60s is not a scholarly book. Some of the anecdotes feel uncritically drawn from press releases--since no sources are cited, it's hard to tell the facts from the spin. (Essoe credits Maureen O'Sullivan with a swimming sequence actually performed by a stand-in in ""Tarzan and His Mate,"" which makes me wonder how reliable he is elsewhere.) The writing style is kind of dated, and it's sprinkled with bits of fan-club hyperbole like ""ERB's fantastic creation has (in all likelihood) directly affected more lives than any other character in fiction."" Even if the book isn't a great place to do research on Tarzan, though, it's juicy, eclectic, and full of (all b/w) pictures. Fun to flip through."
2,Poor Potty for Boys,This toilet seat is a bit too small for boys and does not accomadate their private. Most of his #1 went on the floor because the little cup in front was not tall enough.
5,A great work,"Dr. Quigley launches his first work as if he were a veteran. Second Founding relays insight into the reconstruction of this country that is often overlooked and most times forgotten. However, the decisions made in the decade following the Civil War still maintain a powerful presence to this day. Quigley offers some very original insight into the events of New York City and how they ran parallel with and often shaped and formed the political events of the rest of the country. After reading this book, no one can question the reality of New York's leadership in national politics then and now. This book reads as smooth as a novel with the depth of a textbook. A must read!"
2,Too Narrow a Focus,"The problem with this book is that reading it is rather like watching a baseball game through a crack in the ballpark's fence. What you see is fairly clear, but you realize that you're missing a lot of the action that takes place outside the available field of vision. Just for one example, there are at least four pages devoted to Samuel Tilden's positions during the 1876 presidential campaign but barely a word about the campaign views of his successful opponent, Rutherford Hayes, or of the Republican party. Did the latter's stands offer a meaningful alternative regarding the issues raised by the Democrats? What impact did the results of Hayes's victory have on the ""democracy that emerged at Reconstruction's end"", to use a phrase from the Preface? Of the three elements of the book's subtitle, the book offers a great deal about ""New York City"" but little of the broader context of ""Reconstruction"" and ""American Democracy""."
4,great book but some wrong caculations,"it's a great book on real estate investing,Charlie Munger says""all smart investing is value investing"",so I think this book is one of the best books applying Graham's Value method in real estate field.But you still have to know some errors the author had made in his book,like in Page 71 and 72,the author just made a wrong caculation on the compound return rate,from the investment capital of $20000 to $172301($132301 plus $ 40000 of BTCF)in 20 years, the compound rate should be 11.4% instead of 14%, it is a huge difference in terms of compound rate."
3,Buffett is spelt with two ts,"Dr Eldred obviously knows real estate. But his references to Warren ""Buffet"" annoyed me. It's one of those attention-to-detail things, I guess. He makes the same mistake in his ""Make Money with Fixer Uppers and Renovations"". Apart from that, both books are worth reading"
2,Too much trash,"This book would be a lot better if the author would talk less about how bad an investment stocks are compared to real estate and more about the topic at hand. Almost 65% of the book is about how bad the stock market is. When the author finally talks about real estate, he gives some real good insight on how to buy but there is too much trash in this book otherwise."
5,Works Great,"I was looking for something to tie my dog out in my front yard so he wouldn't feel stuck in the back yard while I'm out there but not to long so that he doesn't tangle and this works great. I looked at the retractable but I don't want the tension of retracting pulling on him, I wanted him to be comfortable so this is what I went with and glad I did. Also, I can take it with me when necessary."
2,Cable shorter than advertised,"No way is this a 15-foot cable. It's more like ten feet. So with my dog's four-foot leash, I end up with 14 feet of cable. Too short. False advertising."
3,our 50lb dog snapped it,"We live in an area with lots of rabbits. When our dog saw one, she ran for it. The stake bent by about 15-20 degrees, and the shop absorber mechanism snapped. We now attach it to a chair. If you have a muscular dog (we have a pit bull terrier type of dog), get a more sturdy device."
4,Great for Camping,I got this for a camping trip since I can't stake my dog out at my townhouse. I love the shock protection on it that keeps my dog from hurting his neck if he runs to the end of the rope. I also like that there is plenty of rope for him to run around on. It seemed to get tangled rather easy but that didn't seem to bother my dog so I guess that doesn't bother me either. :) I also didn't realize that there is a clear plastic protector on the end of it and tried to screw it in the ground without taking that off at first and if you don't remove that it makes it really hard to get that thing in the ground. haha.
5,Cold Water Burning,"I've been a fan of Straley's books after visiting Sitka, which is where he lives. I have read them all and without question this is the best yet! I love an unpredictable book, Straley does well in this fashion."
4,Good power supply,"Upgrading two old PCs with new Intel Core 2 Duo processors and new motherboards we replaced the old power supply with the Coolmax 500.The installation was very easy and fast, the fan is quite, the temperature inside of the PCs is low, even when the fan runs at higher speed. So far a good product."
3,If only they'd been blessed with dialogue,"A lovely story. An intriguing and inspirational concept. An eye-opening look behind the scenes at both international diplomacy and internal/infernal Vatican politics. But the dialogue! Yipes! I had to double-check the cover to be sure it wasn't Robin Cook, the world's all-time worst dialogue writer, instead of Robin Moore. Ray, Robin, you need to get out more and listen to how real people talk. Hint: we don't speak as if we'd written everything out beforehand and are reading from a prepared text. The quality of the characters' speech became so distracting that it detracted greatly from my overall enjoyment of the book."
3,"Not theologically accurate, but an entertaining read.",Interesting idea. Some inaccuracies in the portrayal of Catholic theology but still a quick and entertaining read.
3,Eh...,"While this constitutes a very interesting and entertaining concept, the author has failed in the execution. The writing is stiff, the characterization weak, and the willingness of the reader to accept the story is badly bruised by the failure to develop the conflict within the story. Still, this work is well worthy of attention due to the wonderful concept, the possibilities it presents, and the knowledge one can gain of the Church through the fiction media. Three out of five stars."
1,What a disappointment.,"This has to be the biggest disappointment in a long time. The characters are not at all fictional but are very easily identified as living persons (well, in one case the late Mayor Daley of Chicago) - all the way from a badly disguised Father Andrew Greeley to the present mayor of Chicago to the African Cardinal. I'm very familiar with Cardinal Arinze of Nigeria and he does have a nephew who played basketball at Wake Forest University (he has since transferred). It is totally unbelievable and many of the facts about the Catholic church are inaccurate. These authors wasted their time writing this book and you'll waste yours reading it."
2,Accidental Pope,"This was a very interesting premise with extreamly poor follow through. I was offended at the complete misrepresentation of fact. ""...but an insult to the majority of people in America who were pro-life."" pg208 What poll could the authors possibly be refering to? The writing was poorly done and repetative. How many times can the phrase ""peered owlishly"" appear in a book before it becomes ridiculous?"
2,Lost interest and didn't finish it!,"I only read about 3/4 of this book. The characters and story line were so lame that I just lost interest. I didn't care about what happened to the characters. The situations were just too predictable. With a teenage boy moving into the Vatican, can zipping down the hall on a skateboard be far behind?"
2,Poorly written,"I liked the idea and the possibilities inherent in having a man with a family tackle the Church's thorniest problems. However, the book is so badly written that even exciting scenes were flat. The authors also seem to confuse the ages of the children. The three with the pope are 14, 18 and 20. Yet, the authors frequently have them acting like they are small kids. They also seem to have felt that this pope w/kids would be just like a US President in the way he interacted with his staff, his constituency/flock and other leaders. Reminded me of the poorly written books of other amatuer writters like the former Star Trek stars."
2,"This would make a great movie, but it is a terrible book.","The writing was painful, the dialogue abolutely awful, and the plot got ""too perfect"" after a while. However, the basic premise is wonderful and the idea of all the characters is good. It really could make a wonderful movie - especially now that we all have renewed awareness of the process involved in choosing a new Pope. I'm guessing most production companies don't want to take a risk on films about religion, which is why Mel Gibson had to finance The Passion of the Christ on his own."
3,Good information seeking some direction,"This book is interesting enough for a 10-minutes-before-bed-each-night read. And the writing itself really lends itself to such reading. The authors display excellent inside knowledge of Vatican processes, but so-so writing and character development skills. The basis for the story is thought-provoking, though. Slightly painful in the mechanics at times, but not altogether unpleasant to read."
1,A very bad book,"The cover of this book carries a review comment by Doris Kearns Goodwin that says, "" A suspenseful, provacative lively tale of Vatican intrigue and US State Department guile"". She could not have read the book and written that. More appropriate adjectives would be trite, plodding, poorly written, banal, and disappointing. While the idea for the plot, ie a former priest now a fisherman from the US gets elected Pope, is intriguing, the authors failed miserably to follow up on the promise. I give it one star only because you apparently have to give it at least that or the system won't accept your review.Save your money."
4,The Surprising Spirit,"This book presented an entertaining, insightful and human picture of the hopefully not too distant future Catholic Church. There was limited focus on the outrage and upset that the election to the Papacy of an unknown, married, former priest undoubtedly would precipitate, but I believe that was deliberate. The Spirit works effectively in unexpected and humorous ways if only we trust enough to let her into our hearts and structures. I closed the book with a prayer that someone like Peter II is waiting in the wings...."
2,"Good premise, poor execution","The plot of this book sounded so good--a Cape Cod fisherman who is a former priest, once married and now widowed, is elected to the Papacy. What a shame the writing did not live up to this interesting premise. The first half wasn't too bad--the excitement and novelty clouded the holes in the story and the awkward writing.But once Bill Kelly became Pope and moved to Rome, the story became incredibly heavy and the writing got even worse. There were so many editorial errors that one wonders if it was ever proofread. The depiction of the Pope's children was terrible, not age-appropriate at all. It is as if the writers knew nothing about kids!The dialogue was the worst - it was almost embarrassing to read it, it was so stilted. It was a struggle to finish this book and I had to skim much of the last fourth.Even as a ""retired"" Catholic I found much misinformation about the Catholic religion."
5,Superb,This book is one of the best books i have ever read.Ray makes you feela as if you are involved with the story. This is a good quick read and keeps you on your toes a must for anybody who likes books or wants to learn somenthing.
5,This book is a great page turner,Once I started this book I was drawn into the story and could not put it down. Ray Flynn and Robin Moore write so you want to find out what is going to happen next. Even those who do not know Ray Flynn was Mayor of Boston and U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican will enjoy this book. The Accidental Pope reads like a good mystery.
2,Missed Opportunity,"I really wanted to love this book as much as I loved the plot line - a widower pope with 4 children! And an American! But alas, as many previous reviews have stated, there were so many problems. Poor character development, wooden dialogue, useless plot devices. So much potential gone to waste. I forced myself to finish it hoping for redemption - alas, there was none."
1,Insultingly Far-fetched Fairy Tale,"This title caught my eye while browsing the library's fiction section.I found its initial thrust -- that a layman could be ""jokingly"" elected Pope -- interesting, but the book was all downhill from there. The plot is so implausible and contrived, and the dialogue throughout so wooden, that I struggled to continue reading it, finally giving up around Page 260. I wasn't concerned enough to read the final 132.The writing style throughout was at about a third-grade level, in my opinion, which annoyed and insulted me.I found the review of one Rev. Richard Shmaruk, printed on the book's back cover, REALLY amusing: ""[the authors] have made an otherwise implausible fiction entirely plausible.""Right. ""Thank God"" I didn't pay $24.95 for this piece of tripe."
3,Okay...,"At first I loved the CD and listened all the time, like I do with most new CD's...I guess the songs got to me because after a while I got REALLY sick of them...If you do get the CD don't listen to it too much!!! I will get their next CD, tho, to see if it's different or something...Overall, they're good singers, a bit, really, young like me!! but moderation is the key"
1,Just plain played out.....,"If you like just bubblegum pop songs, this is for you. The songs all sound the same. These girls nasal voices is only 2nd to Britney Spears. Basicly, this is the music industry's attempe to create a couple Britney Spears. As if one wasn't bad enough.....god the horror, the horror!!! What worst is watching a bunch of underdeveloped girls, that look about 10 at the most, trying to look 'sexy.' What has this world come to?!?!?"
4,Play is Super!!!!!!!!,I met the girls at the mall they autographed this cd for me !!! They really sing beautifully for young ladies. I recommend this to everyone who likes pop and r & b!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Play Rules!!!
4,Not bad.,"I love Play, but this mini-album isn't their best. Aimed at younger girls in the teeny crowd with songs like ""Us Against The World"" and ""Disco Hippie"", in this debut Play definatly has spunk and charisma, but lacks song quality. If I were you, I'd go find the European version of this CD with quality bonus tracks like ""To Live And To Die For"" and ""Watch Me Now"". Notable tracks on this version include ""Cinderella"" and ""Remember To Forget"". It's a bit of an awkward mix of styles and remakes and original cuts, but if you truly like Play you'll enjoy it anyway."
5,best girl band ever,"i listened to the cd with my buds kate and renae. i love disco hippie. when i heard it, i totally wanted to dance. i like their voices and their talent."
3,"Ummmmmmmmm, real maybe?",I like but I then again I don't. It's real origanal. It's like all the bands sing about the same thing. l/m/ rocks.
1,Sure they sound good on here. Heard their accapellas?!,"I'll admit it, I thought they were a pretty good band. Talented all that jazz. Then today I was watching HotPop! and they were singing an acapella. They truly [arent great]. It just shows how COMPUTERIZED this album is. The only song I can even listen to without cringing now is ""I'm GOnna Make You Love Me"" because that was on every day on Radio Disney (I was very bored this summer) and I'm a fan of Dream Street. Just hear the accapella on ""HOTPOP"" and hear how horrible their voices are. Especially Aniias and the one that looks like she's 3. I think my dog can sing better.No Secrets is about 3x as good and don't even try Triple Image; just as they say in one of their songs ""we started hte band to get the boys"" and they can't even do that except for boys under the age of 12."
3,"Play is Ok,but where is the rest of it","Don't get me wrong play is great, but there are only 7 songs I mean where are the others, most cds have more then 7. The only song I don't really like is Disco Hippie its too well childish, the other songs are great but that one is....yeah. I gave this cd 3 stars because the limit of songs that are on the track. But all-in-all this cd is a great cd too sing and dance too so you should get the cd just don't be too suprised on how many tracks there are. Thank You for reading this.=0)"
1,"Oh no, not Brittany Spears wanna bees!!!!!",I've been really dissappointed to see this band become so popular.I think it's really sad that they're only 12 and 13 and they already are trying to look like Brittany Spears.I think it's equally sad how our culture today encourages teens and young girls to look and sing and dance like Brittany Spears.These girls have a pretty good talent and I'd probably rate it a 3 but I would not advise anyone to get this cd.
3,not ready,these girls are to young they need to grow up some more but dont get me wrong they can sing but there just to young
4,Play Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love Play, They are definetly my favorite band in the whole world.I am going to rate the songs on this CD and tell you what I think about themIm Gonna Make You Love Me~4/5 One of the best songs in the CDUs Against The world~ This was Plays 1st single of this album It is a very catchy song It gets annoying after a while thoughCinderella~5/5 In my opinion this version is way better than the one Disney Channel used for the movie the Cheetah Girls.Hoplesely Devoted~5/5 Not as good as the original but it is still greatIs it love~5/5 I love this song it is a very soft baladI dont get down like that~ 5/5 I really like this song it has an R&B TouchDisco Hippie~ 3/5 In my opinion this is the worst song in the whole album.Overall this is a good CD for any pop fan if you like pop go out and buy it if you dont stay away from it. I only gave it 4 stars because it only has 7 songs."
4,nice,I used to think that they weren't so good. But I listened to some of their songs and they're not so bad. They have some nice songs that can relate to girls and they have nice voices.
1,eeewww!,This is nothing but a bunch of over processed junk! It is an album full of anoying badly written bubble gum music. It is easy to see why the only places their videos get played are on nickelodeon and the disney channel
1,OH DEAR LORD THE WORLD IS OVER,"Play.. *sigh* what is there to say about this band..hmm..Maybe the fact that one man who can't sing or play an instrument can slap a band together and hire people to make music for them..Does this sound wrong to you? because it does to me.""GROUPS"" LIKE PLAY ARE KILLING MUSIC. KILLING. MUSIC."
3,Ok cd,"This cd is ok. The songs are good and everything, but sometimes play doesnt sound right.First of all , they dress WAY too old for their age. Second, people are always trying to compare play and no secrets. No Secrets is way better!! If you want a girl group to like , try no secrets. Unless youre rich or something, Do NOT buy this cd. go for triple image or no secrets instead."
1,Yeah...I bet...,"Oh, boy, here it comes. Pop, the evil of this music generation. And, how people say Britney Spears is a better influence on kids than bands like Linkin Park or KoRn, I don't know. She just inspires people, like these girls, to go out and dress like h**kers. These ""singers"" are just another unheard of underage pop band that only get support from Nickelodean. I suggest you check out some real music, like Linkin Park, Korn, Dope, Cold, Slipknot, Staind, or Murderdolls. That's all."
4,not really about the CD,"hey all, this isnt really about the CD, but did anyone else notice the disney channel 'cheetah girls' music video/version of cinderella? any opinions on that or does anyone know whats going on with that?"
3,A Little Stupid,"I think Play is not like any other band.They had songs from stories and their way of,""I'm Gonna Make you Love me,"" is he best way of singing it.They are sicko because they sing some ... songs like Cinderella.The only song I like is,""Us Against the World.""No Affense but get another CD instead!"
2,I've Heard Better,"Only one of them sings in like the whole CD, I only like about three songs, and for 3 out of only a selection of seven songs, thats quite pitiful."
1,Don't Even Bother!,"I hope you like boring...horrible sounding bubblegum music, because this is what you get when you waste your money on this c.d. You'll probably regret buying it. First of all, these four girls who look like they are ten years old are just Britney Spears[look alikes]. Second, they dress like Christina Aguilara, who is far more talented then they are. Third, THEY CAN'T SING!! In fact, I agree with the reviewer who says that they are only supported by Nickelodeon, which is oh-so-true! I wonder how many fans they really have? Oh yeah, and that horrible song ""I'm Gonna Make You Love Me"" with Chris Trousdale from Dream Street was totally messed up, since now there were five people you had to listen to that couldn't sing. In closing, you are so better off listening to good female singers and bands, like Britney Spears, No Doubt, Pink, Destiney's Child, Christina Aguilara, Avril Lavigne, and Vanessa Carlton. Well, that was my review. Hope it was helpful."
3,I'M GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME!!,"VERY NICE CHA CHA LIKE VERSION OF THE EVER LOVIN'SUPREMES & THE TEMPTIN' TEMPTATIONS ""I'M GONNA MAKE YOU LOVE ME"" YOU GO GIRLS,LOOK OUT MOTOWN,SOUL BROTHER OF DOVER!!J.H."
3,Not as good as I thought it might be,"When I got this album, I thought it would be great, but I was wrong. It's extremely candy-pop, and it gets annoying. The last song is a hopeless attempt to finish the album, and does nothing but make you wonder why you ever bought the CD in the first place. The entire album is entirely ""shake-n-bake"", with lyrics that are not at all meaningful and melodies that have been heard a thousand times. Unless you have money to spare and time to waste, don't buy this album."
5,This girls rock!!!,"I became a fan of this quartet's music when i first heard their song i'm gonna make you love me...i have been a huge fan since.....i thought that i'm gonna make you love would be the only good track on this album i was wrong. all the tracks are cool and shows their incredible vocal range. they are about to drop a new album called REPLAY on june 10th 2003..and i can t wait to get it. it is going to be a hit record just like their last album...i new album has more of a mature edge with hit tracks like "" i must not chase the boys"" and a remake of "" whole again"" which imust say is way better than the original. check out the groups offical website:www.play-central.comyou can watch their hit vids for this album as well as two tracks form their upcoming hit album replay.it hits store june 10th 2003...in just a few days."
2,I Hope They're Playing Around,"My sister just got into a Play kick, and she has fallen. I have to endure strains of ""Disco Hippie"" all day. With Christmas coming up, she's asked me to buy her a Play CD. Which one will it be??? Play: Who signed these people? Replay: OOOO, jump from 13 year olds to about 24 year olds. Don't Stop The Music: everI everhate everthis everalbum. Everwho everput ""Evergirl"" everon everthis everalbum?? Why not morph into someone with talent Play? I think my sister's going to get some scrungies this year."
3,Tao and Longevity,"Overall this book was interesting. I do agree, however, with the poster who stated that this was not for beginners. It was translated and the writing is a bit awkward at times. There is a lot of cryptic information that, unless you have a previous knowledge, can be sort of difficult to digest. There are interesting illustrations regarding different meditation positions and also energy paths."
4,Essential for intermediate to advanced readers.,"This book has a lot of generalized information about meditation. Listed within is every basic path to enlightenment. I believe it is for more advanced readers because the focus seems to be commentary regarding common misconceptions about meditation and enlightenment, and because without a strong foundation much of the classical axioms won't make practical sense.Informative, Supplementary, More of a warning manual than instructional, Underplays the importance of sexual qi-gong, Heavy Buddhist influence arguably at times with undertones of rejection of Taoist concepts, Claims DanTien meditation causes disease of the Lower Body."
3,Not a wow factor,"I've had really great, bold full-flavored espresso and unfortunately this isn't it. Tastes a lot like grocery store ground espresso. Not great but not bad either. For the price, it should be much, much better. Going back to Caruso's Cafe Italiano which is still by far the best tasting, boldest espresso I've ever had."
5,Espresso!!! Espresso!!! Espresso!!!,"I've been trying different Espresso from Amazon since they have a large selection to choose from. This is brand number five, Alessi is by far the best! It's a rich tasting Espresso, not bitter but creamy with a hint of cocoa. Best Espresso on Amazon! I found this Espresso months ago while shopping to refill my stockpile, but it was not available at the time. So I added it to my wish list in hopes it would be back in stock soon. Looks like no one has discovered this Espresso! yet. I sure it won't take long for my secret to get out .............Espresso!!! Espresso!!! Espresso!!!"
5,I'm a fan,"I've been an illy fan, but being a cheap arse, was looking for a good alternative to the pricier illy stuff I like. Alessi is a good coffee and I enjoy it using my french press."
5,"Perfect fo a rainy day, the urban, English Copper, ever so polite, deeply thinking of the human comedy - and a convoluted plot,","I am fond of the American legacy of hardhitting men trying to put the world right - in high tempo.Therefore Harvey`s policemen in London is like a breath of quiet air on a rainy London night, the urban English Copper, ever so polite, absorbed by the comedy of human life - solving the convoluted plot by reasoning and understanding. Read it, and fall in love with the steady and contemplating men dispensing law and order in a civilized way in a complex world. And the complex plot miraculously clears at the end. Brutality is found in strange places. Read, and enjoy.."
2,Weak,This book hasn't aged well. The entire premise would be laughable in the 21st Century. The characterization is typical of a first novel and the plot isn't one of the better Resnick stories.
1,yuck,"The book is not worth reading. The characters are middling, the plot uninteresting, the conclusion arbitrary and awkward."
1,Hands still cold and wet,"Here is another glove advertised as waterproof that's not. I work for a town in New England and do a lot of snow clearing with a snow blower and shovel. For about the first hour they were not bad, but then the wet started seeping through. Within 2 hours my hands were absolutely soaked and cold. Nuff said."
5,Waterproof Gloves,"I bought these gloves as a gift for a friend that loves snow boarding. He said they are waterproof and warm, he really likes them."
3,Decent Gloves.,"Gloves are very nice although they run a little small. I had to email the vendor about what was taking shipping so long. I received no reply, however I did receive the gloves the next day via next day USPS."
1,STAY FAR AWAY!,"BE WARNED: This is NOT Redbone. This is a collection of ""all new recordings"" by ""one or more of the original members"" of Redbone. This is barely more authentic than listening to a cover band at your corner bar playing Redbone songs. Actually, I'd rather listen to a cover band at the corner bar."
2,Mobile only works on conventional cribs,"This is a very pretty mobile, but it does not have an adjustable clamp, so if your crib railing is too large - most are anymore, then it does not fit without ruining the wood off of your crib rails when you try to force it on. You are only supposed to clamp it to the sides or back."
2,Doesn't run long enough,This ties into the rest of the bedding beautifully - but doesn't serve the purpose for our daughter. It should be made to run longer so you don't have to continually wind it up.
1,useless...but matches nicely,"This matches the crib set beautifully, but is less than stimulating (boring shapes) and misses the mark for soothing as well as it shuts off just as my daughter starts to nod...which wakes her up fully and immediately. Irritating for both of us! I bought the Fisher Price Rainforest mobile as a replacement. Doesn't match, but really keeps her entertained and has a remote so I can restart after 18 minutes from the doorway."
2,Zero Pemission? Really?,"On the back of this album, it boasts ""0 Editing - 0 Mixing - 0 Permisson"" 1 out of 3 isn't bad. The keyboards sound like they were duped in after the fact. And how could this album have been released without permission? It is put out on a label run by the founder of the group.These musicians blunder their way through 8 songs with bland lyrics only a pre-teen old mall goth could bang their head to. Although the music is inventive, it is dragged down by musicians who aren't particularly talented.Where The Souls Wander would be a better starting point if you're set on buying a 13 Winters release. At least they polished that one up a bit."
4,beautiful but small,love it. just what i wanted - on not quite as big as i wanted. need to refill it quite often.
2,This is why I dont usually buy things online,"The description says it can fit a 15-inch laptop, but it can't. The price for shipping to return and the restocking fee would make it cost almost as much to return it as it did to buy it, so I have to find another use for it. The bag itself is nice looking, but once you feel the thinness of the straps, you can tell it is not high quality."
5,Absolutely superb.,This is one of my all time favorite albums. The lyrics are amazingly poetic and meaningful.
5,One of the Top 5 albums of all time...,"and quite possibly THE top album. Every song is beautiful. The lyrics and the musical arrangements on each song are like nothing you've ever heard. Any music fan will be doing themselves a diservice by not giving this album a listen. When you do, your ears and your mind with thank you."
5,Amazing album,Its really amazing how so many bands get caught up in the industry and forget about what making music is all about. Mewithoutyou knows how to make an awesome cd. This album is out-of-this-world. Aaron Weiss gives everything into this cd. He leaves nothing out. Every song on here can be played over and over. The lyrics are so heavy and honest. I cant begin to describe their sound. Just do yourself a favor and buy this cd and the rest of their material and watch them live.
3,Making Excuses,"This could have been a decent read if the authors hadn't so many times overlooked the absurd thinking of Galileo's adversaries. All too often, the lack of evidence backing the ideas of the religious was glossed over while Galileo's was pointed out again and again. Then again, red flags went off right from the acknowledgements; when your first thanks are to the Templeton Foundation, that's rarely a good sign."
3,too much of a victim,"I love the guy or gal in the wrong time period scenarios, but this one had a major flaw....yes, the female can be a victim, but there is such a thing as too much victim...Jennifer got hurt at least a half dozen times and had to be saved at least that many or more. And yet, she doesn't let Dar be the man enough...it was interesting enough to make me want to read the series however"
4,A wonderful Getaway,I loved this book for it's great humor and time travel. Everyone can use a little time away from the present. Although the heroine in this story was a little bit weak and whiny she pulled through in the end with a strong perfomance. Judy Di Canio should definatly write again.
4,Wonderful Debut !,"The author shows amazing talent and imagination. The characters well deveolped and certainly unique. I personally enjoy humorous dialouge and the author provides this through out the book. The only disappointment I encountered was in the fact that the author left us hanging on the secondary characters, such as Lor, Loki, and Snorri.... and epilouge would have done this work wonders. Even with that one drawback I would without reservation recommend this book."
2,Too negative,"Imagine having a norse god and dragon in your house and you are worried about your furnature? I found the heroine too down on men and too winey in general. Ok, by the end she gets it a little more together, but the journey wasn't very enjoyable."
5,"Thank God for ""Magic Bullets""","Edward G. Robinson playing-get this-something other than a gangster! & yes, his performance is VERY believable. This black-n-white film centers on that part of the German Dr. Ehrlich's life who, while facing the drawbacks for being Jewish (typical of his times) & having the audacity to think like a liberal scientist by ignoring such things as race preferences when hiring personnel in his labs by choosing an Oriental(eeegads!), developed the theory of creating antibodies to fight disease. Something that all the immunizations we get today are based on. He called them ""magic bullets."" Altho' he was criticized by some of his peers for being off the wall, for the next hundred yrs almost all the advances in disease prevention/treatment were based upon this man's work. An enjoyable as well as informative movie, this was Mr. Robinson's favorite role that he played. Once watching this movie u will never look at that vaccine or allergy shot without thinking of Dr.Ehrlich again!"
5,Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet,I really enjoyed this movie. I didn't know anything about Dr. Paul Ehrlich or what he has done to improve the health of a nation with his serum to cure syphillis and diptheria and help with many other diseases. I had to do a film critique on this filmn and I got a 47/50 because I forgot to put a cover page on my critique. But I was happy with that and I truly enjoyed this film.
4,Intelligent biopic,"Well-staged and perfectly cast, with a literate and reasonably scientific script. Classic direction makes the best of the performances, and James Wong Howe delivers his usual glittering black and white photography, making the best of the sets and such action as there is."
1,not JERSEY,"These sheets because the seller claimed them to be jersey. It took a long time for them to send them. When they finely got here, they were polyester. They do not stretch like jersey and will not fit my husband's hospital bed. My dying Vet husband (ALS) waited every day on these. They are just plain white sheets with a nice (one) pillow case. This is a rip off. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"Unless you pencil thin legs, don't bother",These were unreasonably narrow even for a normal size person with normal size legs. I gave them to my 12 year old niece for dress up and they barely fit around her thigh.
2,not what i was seeking,"i was wanting boots that came pre tied and all you had to do now was zip them up, well i was wrong. and you have to tie them up on your own after putting them on, takes about 10mins depending on how well u can do this just to put one boot on.. its kind of ridiculous."
4,Diversified Power T Offense,"This is a good book on ""smash mouth"" football. As a Wing-T coach it offers a power series that fits in very well with the Wing-T. In addition, this book has the origins of the ""Toss"" offense that has become very popular in recent years. Coach Coviello calls it his ""Cutback"" series."
3,A light-weight read...,"A very light-weight read. Touching, but not a lot of substance.Makes a good gift for someone who doesn't like to read..."
1,Get the original release,"This re-issue features re-recording by hired musicians to replace the work of Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake. If you want the real tracks, buy the original release used, that way you will have Ozzy's songs they way they were meant to be heard."
3,just wanted to let you know,"for those who don't know i want to tell you that the ""no more tears"" song is edited to make it shorter than the original not to erase the foul language. thank you"
3,"Good, but could have been better","A good collection of hits, but there are more that could have been on there...There's no S.I.N., Tonight, Desire, Thunder Underground, Fire In The Sky, You're No Different.Only 15 songs to cover a 14 year period, and 2 of the songs are from the Black Sabbath era, making it 13 songs to cover a 14 year period of solo performance. Less than 1 song per year.I agree with Richburg. Jamie, without Ozzy and Black Sabbath(one of the best bands of all time), there would be no hard rock or metal today. Next time, show a little respect to the man that made it ok for Rob Zombie and Slipknot to play their own music."
4,Liked it!,"Looks like I'm odd man out on this review. I loved this compilation. I also have the R. Rhodes tribute CD and hate it.So, this one is the CD I drag out when I want an Ozzy fix."
2,BEEZLE-BOOB,"OZZY OSBOURNE-THE OZZMAN COMETH: Am I the only brain dead idiot out there that doesn't subsribe to the theory that musically ""Ozzy is God"", and not ""The Prince of Dorkness""? THE OZZMAN COMETH is a collection of Beezle-Boob's so-called career highs (I'll skip the easy joke), mostly focusing on his post-Sabbath output, save a couple of throwaway ""new versions"" of BS classics. The Randy Rhoads-propelled early hits CRAZY TRAIN and I DON'T KNOW represent Ozzy's best solo work; that era's power sorely is diminished by later synth-intrusive power ballad dreck like MAMA I'M COMING HOME and IF I CLOSE MY EYES FOREVER. There's nothing here that Alice Cooper and Roky Erickson haven't done better, with at least a fundamental grasp on harmony. Ozzy has bitten off some canny career chunks, from small critters' heads to MTV's inexpilicably popular snooze-fest THE OSBOURNES. As for innovative, engaging rock & roll?...this incomplete anthology just kinda bites.RATING: TWO RABIES SHOTS"
5,Colors of Ozzy.,This is a well rounded best of album. Ozzy has really shown us all the eras of his career. This is definite keeper.
3,I told ya (all)!,"...Well, here it is, the remastered version of the Ozzman Cometh. And which song is missing from this release? ... YES! ""Shot in the dark"" was removed, and ""Miracle Man"" was put instead. And of course, the original versions of the songs from Blizzard and Diary have also been replaced. ... It's a shame that so many young fans who are purchasing those records will never get the chance to listen to them in their original form, as they were meant to be heard, and will only know these dreadful remasters...."
2,Stop Complaining,These are the rerecorded blizzard and diary songs. they stink. stop complaining about the length and/or selections and buy the essential ozzy osbourne for a few bucks more.
2,won't rehash here.,"Won't rehash the story line here as the other reviewers did such a good job of it. I will say that it get rather frustrating that the hero, Rolf, decided to use an innocent, Meghan, to make her brother pay for what Rolf believed he had done. If Rolf and Connor were such good friends before why would he believe such a terrible thing about him. Heck why would he just assume things about Meghan. He really didn't seem too trustworthy. The dialogue was a bit sophmoric at times and really didn't seem to deep. Perhaps that characters could have been more developed and not so flat."
5,A delightful read,"The author has a way of making the time period come alive while not requiring the reader to decipher strange language and dialect. Too many historicals superimpose today on the past, but the author manages to intertwine them so a modern reader doesn't have to reach for a dictionary, or wonder why the characters speak in modern idiom. She has a knack for moving the twenty-first century back in time so today's reader feels both transported and grounded. And the hints of a time traveler in the next novel are enticing. I can't wait. I'm sure there will be a lot more where this one came from."
2,Needy Alpha male + lusty shrew = Risk everything...,"This is one oft the less wittier romance novel I've recently read. Our hero Rolf is hardly more than a needy alpha man, drawn by vengeance and trying to screw the lusty and battlesome shrew Meghan. I could not detect any characterisation whatsoever here, apart from the end where Rolf actually does have some musings about Meghan. He is indeed the more likeable of the two. The plot is dim, too: hero abducts heroine, they fight, he brings her to his castle, they marry/shag, he marries another (oh yes!), they fight & shag, the other one dies, they shag again & again, and marry again. Despite the dim plot, it is a fast-paced romance nonetheless, but I must say, it only gets really interesting when the other woman (Ailsa) comes into play, and I really liked the secondary characters (Ede, Alpin).All in all not that bad a read, but I still prefer a little more wit in my romances."
3,Beyond Common Sense,"I was very disappointed in this story. If someone, no matter how long I knew them, treated me this way at the beginning of this book I sure wouldn't handfast with them! They would have to rape me! You can resist the sexual persuasions if you are angry enough. Nothing would convince me to trust Rolf and I would never forgive him for this deep of a betrayal! Although a well written book, there is no psychological common sense in Meghan's reactions to Rolf. Both characters disappointed me."
1,erm....,"She failed to engage me as a reader, in fact, her writing was quite distracting and irritating. If you don't like the characters and the writing is hard to follow, why would you stick with the book? After muddling through this wrack, I had to put the book aside in frustration.Loved the plot idea, hated the writing. Wish another author wrote this."
3,Maybe 4 stars with some editing...,"The story on the cover of this book seemed interesting to me and I started reading with enthousiasm. After only a couple of pages I became very irritated with the writingstyle though, and I was so annoyed that I couldn't appreciate the story anymore. For example: The first time the two main caracters meet, Megan is hiding in a cave but Rolf finds her. What follows is an annoying amount of very short, badly written sentences that made me grind my teeth! My expectations of the book practically dropped to zero. However, I kept on reading and discovered that the writting improved from that point on and I even regained some of my original enthousiasm for the story. I liked the tension between Rolf and Megan and there were some scenes that touched me. All in all I'll give this book 3 stars but it would greatly improve with some editing."
4,Local is Lekker,"I heard one of the tracks ""Sylvia"" on a local radio station (Ikwekwezi FM)one Sunday morning and was overcome with emotion. For people of my age group(mid-40's), this would not be suprising as this and many other songs on the album are songs you would very easy sing along to. These are songs we sang in church, at school music competitions or at weddings. I say thanks to SABC for capturing them on cd. You have helped preserve an important part of South African cultural history. The CD is a must have in every South african household."
4,Read this over your child's shoulder,"Written for middle-grade children, this book is of the highest order. It is immensely enjoyable, written in an engaging and intelligent style. The illustrations and facsimiles of colonial newspapers contribute a lot, and the author communicates an infectious interest in his subject (though at times it may seem to walk the line of being overly adulatory). With his background in teaching mathematics, I was a little surprised Mr. Adler did not make more of the ""magic squares,"" but no matter. Recommended for use in the classroom, or as summer reading for parents to enjoy with their children; and even for the general reader."
5,What a biography should be,"Mack's life of the endlessly fascinating T.E. Lawrence is examplary on all counts: exhaustive (but not exhausting), meticulously and thoroughly researched, and well-written. It's a pleasure to come across a biographer who eschews the irresponsible scandal-mongering that plagues so much of the genre today. No facet of Lawrence's life or behavior is spared, yet it is all scrupulously even handed. This is especially rewarding because Mack is a psychiatrist who provides reasoned explanations for so much about Lawrence that's only provided grist for the sensationalist mill in less-responsible hands. One of the best biographies I've ever read!"
5,"Pulitzer prize winning book, not in the biography area",This is a biography of T.E. Lawrence that leaves all the rumors and inuendo behind. An honest look at a powerful intelect and a true hero.
4,Very interesting book if you want to study his psyche.,"I was looking for a book that kind of summarized the accomplishments of TE Lawrence's life - this is not it. It was written by a Psychiatrist who's main interest is the emotional basis of TE's life. There are anecdotes of his deeds and exploits, but they stop short of satisfying my curiosity. It talks a lot about TE's relationship with his Mom and family and his military companions and makes a lot of guesses as to why he did what he did. Like I said, I am more interested in what he did and not why so although this was a good read, not what I was looking for."
2,didn't live up to expectations,"When I bought this course (bk & cassettes) I was expecting something user friendly, with a few good pictures or fotos here and there and for the author to guide you through the material. Unfortunately I found a boring, unimaginative text which was difficult to use. Although the book does cover most of the important points of grammar and vocabulary, it is dry and boring to read. The book reads a lot like an instruction manual for a piece of home hardware, which bored me in minutes. Finally, the tapes, the voices on the tapes speak too slowly, getting used to hearing conversation at normal speed after hearing the dialogues on the cassettes would be really difficult. My advice, save your money and look elsewhere or wait for a better course to come on the market."
3,Sense and sensebility,"The voice of Sezen takes me away, far away from the daily sorrows and leads me to something beautiful. Although I dont't understand Turkish, ( I know some words like; Merhaba,gule,gule)I can feel it.Thats the mistery of art which brings people together,leaving all ptrjudices and borders behind."
5,Monster hit,"She's done it again, she is the Queen of Pop, she is perfect as usual. This is another master piece, Viva Ajda. We love you...."
5,"Excellent book, covers the 1st half of Burning Man's history well","Excellent book, covers the 1st half of Burning Man's history well. Interesting and well written, with an insiders view and stories. To get the second half of the story, the up to 2010 events, read ""Tribes of Burning Man""The Tribes of Burning Man: How an Experimental City in the Desert Is Shaping the New American Counterculture"
4,quick read ...,"good book, just to know about the history of the celebration and some good pictures. quick read ..."
4,The real thing.,"Four stars only because the ""clicker"" does not always click when you push it the first time. We have several of these and they work fine except for the above issue."
1,Only works for older models,I ordered this remote and was never able to use it. We have a new chaimberlain garage door opener. The newer garage door openers have sophisticated codes. Older garage door openers simply have a series of switches inside the remote. This remote will only work with garage door openers that are the old style.
5,Good Light,The light really helps with waking up on dark mornings. The light can be adjusted to face many different ways.
1,Only lasted one year--stay away!,Do not buy this lamp. Mine lasted one year. The small lights went out and the arm would not stay up. I bought it at my co-op and had to throw it away. Stay Away!
2,Never got to use it,When I got it in the mail the case and battery cover were broke. It is made of weak plastic feels like it will break in your hand. When I turned it upside down you can hear stuff rattle around in side of it. I never turned it on. The box it came in did not have any damage. I am calling the dealer tomorrow to return it.
2,a step in the right direction,"This is a serious academic look by a number of respected authorities on the idea of shared leadership within teams. Its main merit is that it recognizes that executives cannot provide all the leadership that teams need in a complex, fast changing, knowledge driven world. But, we have had the concept of informal leadership for decades now, so shared leadership is really little more than a new name for an old idea. Indeed, their concept, like informal leadership, sounds a lot like shared management. Too bad we can't agree on how management and leadership differ as this confusion is infecting all our efforts to develop new ideas about leadership, ideas we badly need for the reasons Conger and Pearce rightly state - increasing complexity and pace of change."
3,Kingpin Really,the start in this book was a bit tooooooooooooooo slow I couldnt really fly with this book like the others I subjecated this as the bathroom read. when things finally started to pick up I was already sidetracked and lackadaisical good book just too slow for my interest
5,"Curing Cancer, one cup at a time","This book and kit is great for helping anyone who wants to set up and sponsor a lemonade stand for Alex's Lemonade Stand For Pediatric Cancer Research. It's a great kit for just plain making lemonade, but I'm sure once you read the story, you'll want to make it an Alex's Lemonade Stand. This kit is a wonderful thing to share with kids and to help them give to a worthy cause."
2,Disappointing,"This is the book I like the least in the Markby/Mitchell series. Nothing seems to happen until well over half way through the book. If you are starting this series, this is perhaps not the best place to commence. I love this series, but this effort leaves me a bit cold."
4,lenox 2006 pooh musical bell ornament,"this is cool. it plays only one song, deck the halls. and it's not the hole thing but it's still worth it. the only reason i give it a four star instead of a five star is because the song in really only for christmas and the sound isn't as loud as a person would want it. like if everyone is quiet u can here it fine, but if even one person is talking u can't here it. so all and all its a good by for the money."
1,Doesn't fit a 1366 socket!,"This is a fan I got for my i7 959 cpu, which is a 1366 socket. The fan does not fit on the cpu! Other than this, the cpu looks cool, but is very easily dented so be carefull when handling. The return was easy, and quick."
5,Gripping European modernism,"The Farrar Strauss and Giroux edition of this book, the Robert Bly translation, is extremely readable and very gripping. (It also has an afterword by Bly and a new and lucid introduction by Paul Auster.) Simply put, I was floored reading this book. The narrator's search for food and shelter through Oslo, his triumphs and defeats, were at turns heart-rending and hilarious (his observations). When he realizes, when he is near his lowest point, that he can sell the buttons off his coat for a few pennies and then becomes happy, serve as a reminder of the triumphant human spirit. Bascially, the novel has no plot and one could say that nothing happens, following around this hapless soul and his search for food, his desire to write a newspaper article. To me, his adventures were riveting."
3,"A gripping novel, but not a masterpiece.","Just finished reading 'Hunger', Hamsuns psychological study. I found the first two parts to be truly masterful, especially PArt II. Felt that Hamsun got a little side-tracked with the introduction of the woman in Part III and that the ending fell flat. Originally, the novel appeared as a ""fragment"", Part II only, and it does read as if later parts were added or forced onto the narrative. Overall a very compelling read especially considering it was written in 1890. Not quite Doestoevsky, Kafka, or Camus, but close."
2,Gush of Conciousness,"""Hunger"", written in 1890, is Knut Hamsun's first attempt at stream of conciousness writing. Most streams of conciousness flow, this one kind of gushes. The eclectic thoughts of the nameless main character are overwhelming and random. Not my kind of book."
3,Gift,I work at an animal hospital. The girls and i love leapord print so we thought it would only be appropriate for our boss. He had a big smile on his face when he opened it and wears it occasionally to humor us.
2,cone head,"This hat doesn't fit very well--if my 21-month old still had a cone head, it would be fine. It doesn't fit snugly on his head."
4,"Does the job, but pricey.","Lowes sells a diamond cup wheel that will fit on the grinder for less than half the cost of this wheel. There is nothing at all wrong with the DC520, except the price."
2,Problems,"The fragrance was adulterated. The shipping was fast, but the fragrance was not equal to that normally buy, I never had problems with the purchase of this fragrance, the first time I get adulterated."
1,never got it,"Would be nice to send a review, but I never got the item I sent for, had all kinds of aggravation to get the problem resolved and I don't think I will ever order from Amazon again because of the hassle."
4,Great quality and very easy to use !,"Good product and you only need about 1 to 2 teaspoons a day which is great considering that for about 20 bucks you get 500 grams. Perfect for a month supply.I use this after my workouts and before i sleep and have seen gains in strength and size.Twinlab quality is good....... plain and simple and is what i refer to as the ""GOOD OLD STAND-BY"".I mean sure some of the new products our there are better.......but consider how much you have to pay for say BSN CELLMAS which costs about $45?!@ and this retails for about $20.I'm sure most guys who work out would disagree since we all know BSN is a great company and CELLMASS is the no.1 product now.Still i was tight for money and this did the job as good as i needed !"
4,Merriam-webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus,"This is a great product. The shipment was so quick that I was unable to cancel the order just a couple of hours after being placed.I had ordered them for a 6th grade graduation class and then found out that the principal wanted the hardback version. So now, I am stuck with 12 brand new paperback dictionaries."
3,"Good, but lacks word origins","I ended up returning this dictionary/thesaurus because I realized it doesn't have the word origin in the definition. Although this might not be a problem for many people, it's something I absolutely require in a good dictionary. So if you need this feature, don't buy this one. Other than that flaw, it's okay."
4,good,"this book is useful, with Thesaurus. But there are not enough words have thesaurus. Now I prefer to use my phone to look up words."
4,Ultimate Spider-Man Limited Edition,"Do you want to go to New York City? Well your in luck! The game is just like new york city. Fight bosses,adventure through New York City,destroy things,and chase peolpe,and sometimes the boss' have people there kid napping.You also have to find tokens which are:covers,landmarks,and secert tokens. So I give this 4"
4,Nice edition of RSV New Testament and Psalms,"This is a beautifully bound little volume, printed in a readable, single column format. It will fit in a coat pocket easily so goes just about anywhere. The RSV, 2nd. edition translation avoids the pitfalls of excessive inclusive language that the NRSV is prone to. My one complaint is the quality of the paper this volume is printed on -- neither india nor Bible paper. I haven't noticed any bleedthrough when I underline favorite passages with a yellow Zebra Zazzle hi-liter. Still, when Cambridge reprints this, it would be good if they would use a better quality paper."
1,Useless,The order was for a 6 ft. adhesive back tape. The box received was marked 50 in. and the actual tape in the box was only 48 in. long. Useless.
3,"a good read for a nine year old, fast-paced and entertaining","This second in the Akiko series is a pleasure in that it features a strong female figure as protagonist, a rarity in fiction for this age group. Yet just as the Harry Potter series appeals to girls despite the fact that its main character is a boy, my son enjoyed this book, and the previous one, even though Akiko is a fourth grade girl. The story is not particularly original, with parts reminding me of Star Wars, Gulliver's Travels, and The Wizard of Oz, but it kept my son's attention and made him want to read on."
4,National Parks,"This is a well written travelogue that is easily packed for a journey to any of the parks in the country. The guide offers a brief overview of the park and then breaks down tours of the parks into length of miles and length of time. It also offers advice on visiting the various parks (complete with rattlesnake warnings and backpack camping rules, etc.). The book offers real life information and does not merely glorify the parks (though many of the photographs certainly does). For instance, in describing the South Unit of Badlands it recommends bringing a USGS topographic map but warns people will still probably get lost (not a pleasant thought, if you've ever been there before).This is a handy book that most people will be able to use. There are side trips to other sites listed after the main park is described. It is more than a coffeetable conversation piece but is still fun to peruse when cabin fever strikes."
2,Wore out quickly,I wore mine out in less than an hour of use on rusty steel. I had previously used a Norton Rapid Strip #04015 which lasted about five times as long and worked better.
1,Pieces were shipped bent and cannot put together,"The side panels were shipped bent and the screws will not screw in. I called the 800 number and they told me to contact the company Ed San Closeouts, from whom I ordered from. I emailed them to tell them that the side panels were bent and they said they would ship two new panels to me. This was two months ago and I am still waiting. I have the frame put together and it is in my classroom, not being put to use. I am very frustrated since I work in an inner-city school with poor-quality classroom items such as tables and chairs."
1,"Piece of junk, very disappointed!!","They should have let you know in the description that the dividers were only ugly brown pieces of corrugated cardboardwhich even if by some miracle had been strong enough to hold 550 pieces of paper as claimed, they are way toomuch of an eyesore for me to want to use in my office. First as I was trying to decipher the very poor images on the instructions,I thought the multiple pieces of slit cardboard in the box were just packaging. Then with great disappointment, I realized thatthey were not part of the packaging, they were meant to be the ""shelves"" and dividers for the unit. Why would they make the outer frameof steel, and make all the shelves just this cheap brown corrugated cardboard, thinner than the box it was shipped in!wouldn't have this in my office even if it were free. Thank goodness I bought it from Amazon, so Ican send it right back with no hassle!"
4,Fantastic Drafting Chair!,"I bought this chair after my last Safco chair (a Metro) was on its last leg after 3 years of solid use. My dogs helped in its demise as well. I was going to buy another Metro but then found the Apprentice II. Love this chair. It has lots of padding and makes extended visits to the drafting table/computer feel like I was sitting in a recliner. It is worth every penny.The only reason why it didn't get 5 stars is because unlike the picture, at least mine, the height extension lever is located in the front of the chair instead of the side. Doesn't seem like a big deal unless you are like me and sit with your legs tucked under a little and then you can accidently hit the lever with your calf causing you to sink with your legs under you! But other than that, this is a great chair."
4,Hide and Seek Safari - Tiger,"I purchased this toy as a Christmas gift for my children. I purchased an extra wand too, unfortunately you can not use both wands at the same time because they interfere with each other and do not work correctly. Despite that, my children will play with one wand, one will hide while the others will hunt together, taking turns using the wand. After several hunts the tigers head fell off, we glued it back together and it still works. We were a little disappointing on the lack of durability, but the game idea is great and a lot of fun."
5,Got this as a gift!,I had gotten this for a gift for a friends child. I still get thanks for it. They love it. I plan on getting it for my wee ones once they are a bit bigger.
3,Not as much fun as I hoped,"My daughter loves tigers and playing hide and seek, but this just didn't hit home like I had hoped. She's 7 and played with it for about three days, maybe 10 minutes each time. Then, it was over. I think it just depends on the child. There's nothing at all wriong with the toy itself."
4,Award Winning Game Reviewed by MommyReview.com,"This is a simple, fun game of Hot & Cold. Mom, dad, sibling, sitter can hide the Tiger and kids are on a wild jungle chase! You can also add on more seeker wands and animals (they now have a monkey) to find in the `jungle'. + It comes with batteries!The game is well made and withstood lots of playtime and little hands. The kids would not stop playing this game, we even had TO READ MORE [...]"
5,Perfect toy!,My 5 year daughter loves this product. She has hours of fun looking playing hide and seek. She as well as us have become very creative of hiding the tiger in different places around the house. This is the perfect toy!
4,Hours of Fun,I sent this to my twin neice and nephew and their older brother. My brother-in-law said it's all they played with on Christmas!
5,GREAT!,"It's getting that ""very used"" look - wonderful information. Always in our travel secion or 'on the road' with us!"
4,Solid entry from a classic artist,"I grew up listening to this album, and recently a light bulb went off to search Amazon for it. So glad I did. To me, music sometimes serves the purpose of not just entertaining but also telling the marginal history of the times. The untold stories and feelings of the ignored and uncelebrated. And this is one of the many recordings where Gil Scott-Heron did just that.Angel Dust, the lead song, is one of those timeless grooves with a deep message. The passion and hurt is something you can't help but feel. It gives voice to the victims of the streets and the ones that they left behind. Other solid efforts as well, especially the sarcastic Madison Avenue. A must have for those that can feel the music moreso than listen to it."
4,works as expected,works as expected. no loss in signal qualitywould have given 5 stars if connectors at end were easier to use and didn't feel so cheap
1,Garbage piece of plastic,"What a rip off this item is. It is a trashy little piece of plastic and sure to break in a week. I am shocked Amazon allows trsh like this to be sold, and even more shocked that they ship it!"
2,Came broken!!,"I gave this item a 2 star review because this item shipped and made it too my house in about 2 days with standard shipping!! That was the good part. The bad was that when I went to screw on the F connector in to my TV and it came off....then when i got it sorta put back on I had no picture on the TV....I checked the cable and there was a part of the cable were it was broken...so that is why I gave it a poor review, maybe it was just a lemon in the bunch but I most likely wouldn't order another coaxial cable from this company."
3,wasted money (in my oppinion),"If I was marketing narrated c.d.s all over the internet-I would edit out the ums. He says ""UM"" sometimes 2-4 times in one sentence. The narrator is enthusiastic about the subject, but could offer more info., it seems, if he had researched a bit. He speaks only from his knowledge/experience (seems like)-that may explain all the ""you Know"" and ""um"" filler throughout- I found listening grinding on my nerves for that reason."
3,interesting reading,Overall good book. Lots of pictures. Good for an afternoon read. Once its been read ==its been read. Don't find myself going back for a second look
1,What is Celtic about it?,"General overview of the Moon in various cultures. While it briefly touches on Celtic culture, I don't know why it's being marketed as Celtic, as there is very little Celtic information here. If you're looking for a general moon book, you may like this, but if you're looking for Celtic moon lore you'd be better off buying The Carmina Gadelica and The Gaelic Otherworld, then you'd have every bit of info the author mentions in here, and more."
5,Scholar and the Pagan,"this book is beautiful. it is rich in research of the mythos, and deep in the workings of ritual, mediation and thought.i read this book slowly and savoured every morsel.personally i followed the book with each Lunar cycle, i would read the A chapter and review the exercises and study that aspect of the chapter/topic."
1,get your facts right,"I wouldn't bother with this one- Yellow Submarine is a McCartney song, which makes the item useless to any Beatles fan."
5,Excellent--for children or adults,"There is great comfort to be found in this sweet story for anyone who has lost a pet. I bought it for a friend who lost her maltese to a sudden illness. Now, her little house dog is not so much like the dog ""Up In Heaven"", but the message resonated and comforted. I bought an extra copy for my young grandchildren who risk losing an aging Shih-tzu. We're going to read it this weekend."
3,Different,"When I finished this book, my first thought was it was unusual. I understand it's fiction, but the story is really unbelievable. The time period and the setting were what drew me in, but I had to struggle to continue from about half way on. Nathan was peculiar in many ways and I just couldn't accept all the bizarre stuff that went on."
4,Darker and Deeper,"Somewhat more complicated than the seven previous entries in the Charlie Resnick series, this one involves a young boy hurtling down the road to a criminal life and his subsequent suicide in a youth facility as well as a series of attacks on gays in a park, and the killing of a police officer. More so than usual, Harvey has these events intertwining in the end. The CID's personal life gets heavy treatment here, as Resnick gets involved in a serious relationship, and a young black officer is added to his team."
2,Why this truncated version?,This is truly strange! The French edtion has 733 pages and this English version is clearly truncated. Why? Can't English readers go beyond what is more or less a synopsis of the original book???
3,??????,"I just read in The New Yorker review of this book that the original French version is wonderful but that this American version is only about half as long and ""dumbed down."""
3,A decent read,"This book is mediocre at best. Overall written well, but the characters are confusing."
1,Factcheckers please note!,"One cannot believe much in a book with an incorrect title. Marie Antoinette was not the last queen of France. That distinction was held by the wife of Louis-Philippe, Marie-Amelie 1782-1866, queen of France 1830-1848. Try instead the biography by Antonia Fraser being published in the US in Sept. 2001."
1,Horrible book!!,"I am at a loss for words to be able to explain how horrible this book is. There is no detail in Evelyne Lever's writing and you can almost hear the contempt in her words as you read it. She obviously did not think too highly of Marie Antoinette and she lets that opinion shine through all too apparently. She makes her appear to be a self-centered, spoiled woman who cared about nothing other than her own amusements and what made her happy. If you want to read a truly worthwhile book about Marie Antoinette then read Marie Antoinette: The Journey by Antonia Fraser."
3,makes no sense,there is not really paln on this to do anythink that is understandableso didnt get played with at all
2,kids did not play with it much.,I thought it will be fun but kids did not play with it much. I don't know why and I don't like to recommend it much.
3,"Cute, Not Played With Much","My 5 yr old and 2 yr old have shared this for 5 months now. They barely play with it. The pen comes off and gets lost in our house; I wish they had attached it better. I thought it was cute and a good idea, especially because it's quiet and doesn't require batteries. We got it for the car and restaurants. The kids don't really enjoy it for some reason."
3,so-so on quality,"Great idea and we are generally happy with this toy but I was a bit disappointed when the rubber shell came off one of the ballbearings inside. As it is a sealed unit we can't open the frame and now have a couple of bits of rubber floating around inside. It should have lasted longer than it did, but I suspect it was a one-off flaw. Given that our little guy seems to like the challenge of the toy I would probably buy this again and give the benefit of doubt regarding quality."
5,a favorite,A classic story of a love of reading and a sharing spirit. Arrived in good shape and in a timely fashion.
5,A humorous and delightful treasure-of-a-book.,"I accidently stumbled upon The Library while searching for another book in the Children's Department of Borders. Its colorful cover invited me in and I flipped through it with sheer pleasure. What a great story! Anyone can relate to it. A former classmate of mine used to have her face buried in some book or another everyday -- during class, at recess, at lunch, on the bus...non-stop, much like Elizabeth Brown. I didn't understand her at the time but definitely can relate now. In The Library, Elizabeth Brown certainly is an extreme case of a bibliophile though she still has an awareness for her surroundings. A terrific book for young and old readers alike. A necessary buy for LIBRARIES!"
2,"Sad story, beautiful illustrations","I was considering buying this book for my high school senior who wants to be a librarian but there's no way I'll lift this book up as a wonderful story of a child's dream come true. Who wants to be alone with books and another lonely old lady for the rest of her life? Unending books, yes. No relationships, no. Sorry. A sweet idea for a story but why couldn't Elizabeth have had a full life? I know it's a child's book, but still, I find it a bit disturbing. Too bad."
2,Book about the creation of a Library and its librarian.,"This is a rhyming book about a girl who loves to read who grows into a woman who loves to read. This woman does nothing but read. She reads while vacuuming, cleaning, eating, sleeping, etc. One day she has so many books that her house is full and she just doesn't have room for one more book so she decides to open a library and share her books with the town.I like the premis of the book. I understand that this woman loved to read but she didn't like to do anything else at all with her life. Yes, it can be seen as the stereo typical librarians life but all the librarians I've ever met like their jobs and can't wait to go home like the rest of the working class. (And of course, she grows old with her many cats.)The illustrations are done in watercolors and are quite intricate. I have read this book once and probably wont read it again. This is not to say it is a bad book, just a tad on the forgettable side."
5,The Best!,"I adore the books of Sarah Stewart. I plan to use these books when I start teaching. Although I live and will work in a majority minority neighborhood, I know any child that can read will love to read this."
2,"Plastic, plastic...plastic","this case did not fit perfectly. The top clip did not click, so it never really closed. The plastic seemed really cheap...as if there was something rubbing off of it."
2,Cute...but not well made,"I love the shoe, and got lots of comments on how cute they are. They run really big, so order a size down. Also, about 5 stones on each shoe fell off after the first wear. Disappointing for $120."
3,no pockets,"These pants have 2 back pockets but no front pockets... I don't know who decided that womens' pants don't need pockets. It is a VERY annoying phenomenon.Anyway, other than that, they seem like some good pants.If you don't have hands.You know, to put in your POCKETS."
3,pants only so so...,"The pants are a lint magnet, and they weren't the same as the pants I had previously received from that style label. they are tighter, shrink, and are longer in the leg (I am short 5'3"") than previously purchased. When washed they shrink but also fade if you aren't careful. These pants have 4 pockets not the two pocket style although that's what the description says. I desperately needed new pants so I am making do with them, but I would not go for these if you have curves."
4,Khaki's,"I ordered a little larger bc all the reviews said they run small and they aren't styled to fit tightly. They are a little long, but I have not washed them, so that is bound to change. They are cute, comfortable, and casual, but maybe a little to casual for work.They were inexpensive and shipped quickly, although I am a PRIME member and get free 2 day shipping. I would order these again!"
3,Cute,"Very cute for summer wear, and the size seems to be accurate, but very thin so they will not last long."
5,i need more jeans,"hi, im trying to order some jeans but seems like u guys r out of it...please let me know whenever u get more cuz i need it for my work i alrady boughth like 5 of those jeans with u guys and i need more."
2,not the best quality,"This is a good narrow fit for skinny and long legs. Like the stretch material but after a few washes, the color fades and the fabric begins to wear out already. Inexpensive, but you get what you pay for with these pants."
5,Great for business casual work pants and every day wear!,"I love these pants. I work from home for the majority of my time, but every now and then I have to attend business casual meetings. Paired with a button-down shirt and dress shoes, these pants are great to wear in a business casual setting. I love that I can still wear a t-shirt or blouse to dress them down with boots or sneakers as well.I have been hanging them to dry to avoid shrinking them in the dryer, but they do require ironing if you choose that route."
1,GROSS!!!,"DO NOT order these! They are rough to the touch, extremely thick, high waisted and outdated! Terrible buy on my part! They were instantly donated."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"I purchase these pants for my ten year old daughter. These pants are just wonderful. My daughter is tall for ten (5'2"" tall) So the length is perfect for her. I have washed them a couple of times and they have maintained their color and length. We will make another purchase of these pants."
4,work pants,"I like your Dickie's work pants. They are confortable, stretch, yet go right back into place without remaining baggy like some pants do. Great fit"
5,"great product, will buy again","These things are awesome!!!! I took these with me on my last camping trip and I had two spare bottles about a quart each I think that I would use for treated water while using these packs. I am completely amazed with these things. The only thing I wish is that they came in some sort of water tight container but a ziplock bag will do the job nicely. They were able to clear some pretty green water in no time at all and the taste was good, there isn't a strong chemical flavor to it, but if there was just leave it in direct sunlight for a few hours and you are good to go. I would recommend these to anyone going camping or hiking."
3,Glad to have them...,Haven't tried them... Just keeping them for emergency. Hope I picked right. Getting a disaster kit together is harder than it seems. Too many kits sold out there have substandard garbage or incomplete or incompatible items.
4,"Taste awful, but do their job.","Oh these definitly work, but make the water taste absolutely terrible. But if you choice is drink something that tastes bad or, say, be dead... Well then, looks like you're gonna have some foul tasting water. At least you know it will be safe to drink!"
5,My go to for purification,"I used these when I was in the Army. There are probably better options out there that are quicker, but I am cheap and these are cheap so I will continue to buy them."
5,good to have,havent used these yet but i figure if their good enough for the military they must work .
1,Nothing like the DS game,We had such high hopes for this game as we LOVE the DS version. My kids & I tried it as soon as we got it and we found it so hard to play. It's a very frustrating game & we gave up on it after a few times. Really wish we would have gotten another game instead.
1,I'd rather play the free version,"This game is fun, however, I have played the EXACT same game with a different title ""Cooking Academy"" that I downloaded for free off of [...]. [...] is a place where you can download free games with unlimited gameplay time if you can put up with a 20 second commercial every 20 minutes. The ""Cooking Academy"" game was a lot of fun. However, after enjoying it as much as I did, I bought this game thinking it would be a different approach to a similar kind of game. It was the EXACT same game but without the weird Japanese/French girl. Do it for free instead of playing the wii. Remember, ""most fun dot com"" is where to go."
3,Rather buy it used,"I was really excited when this game first came out on Wii, because when I first played the cooking mama was on the DS and it was sooo much fun!! But after I played the cook off, I find that it is pretty much the same as the DS just that it has more recipe, which it's cool but its not worth the $[...]. So I would rather buy this game when it is on sale or something, cuz this isnot the best game ever...."
2,"Rental OK, but I would not recommend buying it.","As many people wrote, this game is both interesting and frustrating. Some actions are very easy to perform (like breaking eggs) and some are frustrating (peeling vegetables). There are too many instructions to read before you go to a mini-game, which rules out kids who are not comfortable reading yet.Some of the mini-games are very difficult to understand because there are no instructions on how to do some or in which order to use the ingredients. Moreover, once you complete playing all the games (would take not more than 2 hours), there is no more novelty.For these reasons, I recommend renting this game."
2,"Cute, budget title","+ Cute+ Fairly simple learning curve- Short with no replay value; each recipe is essentially a string of mini-games that last at most 1 minute and there are very few different mini-games- Some actions are extremely fustrating with the Wii Remote (e.g. peeling veggies)- May enterain only young gamers, but game requires significant reading of on-screen instructions= Rent the game. Use a coupon."
2,Boring?,"I've only played this game in single-player mode and it is very boring. I heard it is better with multi-player, I'll try it and hopefully it will redeem any aspect of this game. You just go through cooking recipes... It looks like it's going to be fun but I just found it boring. I finished ""Order Up"" before starting this and that was an extremely fun cooking game. This pales in comparison. Play it instead if you get the chance, although it doesn't have multi-player."
3,Just okay - not as much fun as I thought it would be.,Most of the reviews that I read raved about this game. It is okay. Maybe if I keep with it I will enjoy it more but I could take it or leave it. Definitely not among my top 10 games.
2,Too hard,"I got cook or be cooked, really easy! i got cooking mama, really hard! i'm doing the things she says, and the wii wont pick it up. not worth $50!"
3,Kind of strange game,"The game is not as much as you would think from the cooking mama online games... also... It is VERY...Japanese? The characters have a tendency to mutter things in Japanese that don't sound anything like English, so that is pretty funny. But The game is pretty lame overall, not really like action mode of doing things it is like step by step follow the instructions on the screen...two player was alright.. you can see who is better between you and your friend at making the things but still, not that exciting of a game."
1,Cheesy Game,I didn't like the game. Graphics were not good. Not a very fun game. I would not buy this game.
2,Might as well cook for real,"This game is fun at first. But after a few levels it just gets repeatitive. After you do all this chopping, stirring, peeling, and sauteeing, you might as well cook for real and have an actual meal for your effort. My suggestion: Spend your money on real ingredients for the kitchen instead."
2,Lame!!!,"What a snoozer. Its the same repeative motions throughout the game. You peel a couple of vegetables, then chop them, then fry them with a shake of the Wiimote. And for the challenge segment you touch the salt shaker, wait a few seconds, twist the Wiimote, wait a few seconds, turn the Wiimote, wait a few seconds, click on a leek, wait a few seconds, twist the Wiimote...I think you get the idea.On a scale of 0 = terrible and 100 = greatest game ever: as a game its a 10 (out of 100), as a cooking tutorial its an 11 (out of 100). The music is the same rehash garbage from every other cutesy Japanese game. But what astounds me is Cooking Mama's voice sounds a Japanese girl trying to speak English with a German accent. It amazes me how well she pulls that sound off, I sure hope it was intentional.When I say pass on this game, I mean pass it through the window into the outside garbage can. It will stink up your kitchen if you throw it away inside."
4,7 yr old daughter loves it!,"This is a good game for the kids. My daughter really enjoys helping her Mom in the kitchen and this game is the next best thing without any mess to clean up. You can buy utensils for attachments, but you certainly don't need them. The game is fun without them."
5,It's so much fun!,"Kids love to cook with me at home,but it's a blast trying to cook with this game.They laugh at us because we can't even break an egg correctly,so now they are trying to teach us.It's a family fun game."
1,Take a Pass,"The description of this game got my children excited, so we purchased it as a gift. They were quickly disappointed as there isn't much substance to the game, adn they were able to quickly master it in about two days. Now, it sits on a shelf gathering dust - even our local GameStop doesn't want to buy it. Go figure, and I highly recommend you use your hard-earned money in this recession on something else."
1,Just plain awful,"This game is akin to an awful Japanese movie that is poorly dubbed and seemingly created on a shoestring budget. The options are almost non existent and worst of all, you can't understand a single word the lady host says. It's really frustrating to have to concentrate so hard on deciphering the host's words. Just a bad game."
3,Not for everyone,"Cooking Mama: Cook Off is fun the first time you play it, but then I lost interest. The game would be much better if there were ways to level up and grow in your cooking abilities. Instead, after you've competed a dish you unlock another dish. Pretty lame if you ask me. This game might be fun for kids, but not for adults."
5,A great addition to my Wii games collection.,Fun game to play with the family. Haven't really played any other cooking mama games on the Wii yet but bought it because I heard this was a good one and I'm not disappointed at all.
2,boring one sided game,"like wario, this is a boring one sided game. basically, it's all about using the wii remote. Alot of cutting, splitting, and moving around but there's no real plot to it. Head to head combat is very boring too. No satisfication what so ever. Unless you want this game for waving around the remote Stay Away from Cookin Mama and Wario smooth moves."
2,fun game,"I just got this for christmas for my wii. I love it! My friends have them for their ds, and said it is awesome! And they are right! If you love to cook, this is really the game for you!"
2,Forgettable.,"After the first couple minutes of playing, you start to wonder if the Japanese woman's voice is going to drive you crazy."
2,"worked on ds, not so much on the wii","I loved this game on the DS. I pre-ordered it for the Wii. I was very excited. It was a total let down. The controls are weak and slow. I just finished Zelda, I know how precise the controls can be. And it was not very fun. I am returning it on Monday for what ever insult of a trade in EBX gives me."
3,No BIG thrill,"I bought this game for my five year old daughter. Both she and her sister enjoy it, but it is not as exciting as other Wii games. They will definitely tire of it soon."
4,Better Than Mama!,"I bought this game for my wife and 5 year old son. They love to cook together and this is a gerat way for them to have fun and still share a similar experience.I would have to say that my favorite part of the game is Mama's broken english. I get a big kick every time she says ""Better Than Mama!"". I love the graphics. They are cartoony, but perfect for the game.The game makes great use of the Wii's controls. Whether you are buttering a pan or gutting a fish or even just throwing your ingredients into a pot, you will have fun.I just wish they would have included some Filipino food! I want my digital Adobo!"
4,cooking mama,I puchased the cooking mama wii for my daughter for Xmas. She says that she loves it.. and her 3 young children and husband get into the act too.The wii games are so much fun and the whole family can use them...
2,Cooking Mama is Lots of Fun !.....,But a lot more fun for the DS ! This port wasn't as exciting as expected.
1,Waste of Time & Money,"I love to cook and thought that this game would be like ""Iron Chef"". I was totally disappointed! The graphics are good. The commentating is completely annoying and in non-sensical Japanglish. I feel like I wasted $50 on this game."
4,fun,We are really liking this game! It is great. We do have issues with figuring out how exactly to hold the wiimote to perform the actions at times. This frustrates my daughter and she will quit but she is kind of a quitter anyway. SHe still attempts to play it a few times a day on weekends so I know she still likes it especially when mama tells her good job
4,"""Cooking Mama Cook Off"" is hot stuff",Great game for the whole family. Very clever. Lots of opportunity to interact.
2,Louis L'amour should stay away from cheap romance,"I have loved L'amour since I was a child, it's family history really but this book is a sad example of his work. The words were corny and sappy and the plot fairly predictable. The end left much to be desired. For an excellent book try: Grub Line Rider or the Chick Bowdrie series"
1,AAARRRGGGHHH!,"I am a distressed teenager. I just wasted a whole lot of money on this pathetic book! DOn't buy it! First of all, it's complatetly unrealistic. Second, it's boring. I mean, this kind of fantasy is the most common: kid goes into magic world, kid saves magic world, author struggles to make the character real and with some faults, but ends up destroying the whole thing. If you're a pre-teen or teenager, beware. I nearly died of boredom. The only reason I still have this book is because I paid six bucks for it."
2,Lofts New Designs for Urban Living,"I bought this book on the strong recommendation of the other reviewers and was disappointed. I have bought 8 books on the subject of lofts and this is my least favorate. The photos are generic architect shots, the layout bland and the printing is flat and sometimes fuzzy, and just unappealing.Check out Living in Space and the International Book of Lofts.I have to wonder if the other reviewers are friends of the author...(Just my opinion, your milage may vary...)"
2,Nothing new here,"The good thing about this book is that it does show pictures of lofts....that's about it. It showcased some lofts that have been pictured in other books before, and the picture quality is not always the best(at times the photographs look as though they were taken twenty years ago or with bad film). I usually read my design books but after about halfway through, I just looked at the pictures. Save your money for something else."
4,"A real ""Jack the Ripper theory""","I enjoy the novels that this husband and wife team write about the late Victorian era. What I like the most is the extensive research that they put in each book, as well as the real life characters from that time that they insert in major roles in each story. This book is no exception. It was a fascinating insight into the infamous Whitechapel murders, and a very plausible theory as to who committed the crimes. Kathryn and Charles are wonderful sleuths, and in this book we see a very innovative Kathryn do some undercover detective work. Unfortunately, I had figured out the murderer of the blackmailer early in the narrative, but that didn't take away from my enjoyment of the book. This is a fun series, and you'll find that you become strangely attached to these people as you read."
3,Not their best,"I usually love books by Robin Paige (Susan and Bill Albert), but this one just couldn't hold my interest. It might have been too reliant on historical characters and made-up additions to their life (and since they can't ""solve"" (even really add) anything here, its just one more theory to add to an already over-used topic). I also think its a much better story when Kate and Charles investiagte together throughout the story...while I like the realism of Charles trying to keep Kate out of a gruesome plot (and having her stand up for her right to do so makes the rest of the novels better when he always incldues her), it just wasn't as enjoyable. While anyone who has read the entire series should pick this one up, its only good as part of the entire series. Their other books could be stand-alones. Definitely don't start here - you'll miss their other wonderful books!"
2,Historical tripe,"I've enjoyed the other books in the series, but this one was very disappointing. The authors seem to have relied on lurid, sensational gossip to flesh out their story. A ""penny dreadful"" of the worst sort."
2,DEATH AT WHITECHAPEL,"THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN BY ROBIN PAIGE, WHICH IS A PEN NAME FOR MARY CHESNEY. BUT THIS IS NOT HER BOOK, THIS IS WRITTEN BY A DIFFERENT WOMAN. WAS NOT SATISFIED AT ALL WITH IT."
2,Very old in nice package that makes it seem modern,This dvd is a waste of time. It's shot in 1970 super old super old tools instructions goes very fast..difficult to follow.. And suddenly their remodeling is done.. They skipped Tons of stepsIt's a lame DVD
2,Buy Sendak's book instead.,"I was disappointed with this book. I did not like that her father kept her locked away, how he mocked her when she recieved her ""gift,"" and how she turned her father into a mouse. There are so many bad influences on children today, I don't need a book telling them that they don't need to listen to their parents. I am my childrens biggest advocate. Buy ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Altough the boy gets mad at his mother and runs away (in his mind) he comes home because he loves his mom and knows she loves him even when he has been bad. The illustrations in ""The Red Wolf"" are wonderful, but not good enough to make it worth the clearnce price I bought it for."
5,Knit what you want! I agree.,"I ordered this on a whim after seeing it mentioned on Facebook. No little children in my family at this point. Very good for its message of fighting ridiculous restrictions imposed by adults (and I agree with a lot of restrictions imposed by adults on children, but not locking them in a tower.) As I knitter, I know we are sometimes pressured to knit things we'd really rather not. So ""Knit what you want"" is a good message on a different level than what the book is saying."
5,Beautiful book - well done,"Nice presentation of many well known designers work spaces - you come away knowing that there is no precise way to make a great workspace, but you are inspired to know that many things are possible, and if you have an idea or a great centerpiece item, don't be afraid to go with it!"
2,It seems organizing clutter still equals clutter,"Honestly, I don't know how these women can work let alone create in these clutters spaces. I understand the idea of inspiration, however I will never understand how you could not be overwhelmed and distracted by all the STUFF they have displayed. I am a very visual person and enjoy seeing the things I love being displayed but I don't display everything I own in one room. If you like that look then this book is for you and you can have mine as it's in the donate pile after owning it for one day. If you like an organized and uncluttered look this is not the book for you."
3,Where Women Create,"Honestly, I have to say that I was disappointed after reading all the great reviews on this book. There were only 2 rooms that I even felt like I could begin to connect with - - - I think the idea that many of us are looking for, is how to put a great looking, creative room together without having to break the bank. I would love to be able to see how to cheaply recycle items and make them attractive and usable in our rooms."
3,Where Women Create,This book has the best cover and it looks like a great idea book for setting up a creative space or improving a space. I was not as happy with it as with a few other craft space books out there. It you like reading about women who are already professional in some form or another and thier craft spaces this is your book. For that is truly the gist of the book. I enjoyed it and while it wasn't exactly what I was looking for I found some great motivation from it. Jnetti.
3,Good book but......,"This is a good book with beautiful pictures of craft spaces. I ordered in the hopes of getting ideas & inspiration for my craft space, but got none."
2,Where WOmen Create:Inspiring Work Spaces pf Extraordinary Women,I bought this bought because I am designing my own studio and wanted some ideas. I found this book VERY inspiring and full of great ideas! I recommend it to anyone designing their own creative space!
4,Where Women Create,I enjoyed the variety of creative women they featured. The photos were helpful and I got a lot of ideas for my new studio.
3,Visually pleasing,While I was hoping for more this was a visually pleasing book. I enjoyed seeing how different creative women utilized their space. I would have like to see more spaces
4,Casual Cottage Chic favorite,"What a delight to find many of our favorite artists in their working spaces. Cindy Ellis is one of our favorite artists...delighted to have a peak inside her studio, and studio's of many other creative women. They are all an inspiration to design and color!"
4,For wife for Christmas,"My wife has been buying the magazine version of this for some time now so I got her the book, which is actually less costly than the magazine. If you like the magazine you'll like this book."
4,Where Women Create,"Delightful book, I especially enjoyed the ""peek"" into April Cornell, Kitty Bartholomew & Dee Gruenig's rooms!Even though all the rooms where set-up for the photo shoot, if you look closely you will get an idea of their personalities...Great photography and wonderful little Tips from the participants."
2,"Disappointing, but it may just be a matter of taste","I bought this book because I'm designing an expanded studio space for painting and collage, but found it disappointing. I cringed at some of the crafts and art featured in the book; a lot of it is cutesy, and just not to my taste. The studios also seem overdecorated, but again, that's just my personal taste. I like a studio space that's more modern and functional, with lots of clear space, so most of the studios featured in the book seem cluttered and ""frilly"" to me. Other reviews here attest to the fact that many people love them, so just take this as a warning if you prefer a modern, functional look. In that case, I recommend Dream Sewing Spaces, by Lynette Ranney Black (with lots of ideas for any art or craft medium), as well as Setting Up Shop, by Sandor Nagyszalanczy. I found both these books inspiring and practical."
2,A Very Poor Representation of the Diversity and Beauty of San Francisco,"As a native of San Francisco, I found this DVD to be VERY disappointing! It's shallow, unimaginative, uninspiring,uninteresting and short.With the exception of the footage of the 1906 Earthtquake and Fire and the still shots, which are quite beautiful, it has ittle to recommend it. There is so much more that could have been done to make one of the world's most beautiful, fascinating and exciting cities come alive. If you want to see the real San Francisco, don't waste your money or time on THIS DVD!Alexandra von Wrede"
3,explore San Francisco,"I am thinking about visiting San Francisco and thought this might give me more of an insight into the city. I liked the concept of the city being seen from three different viewpoints. Land, sea and air. The choice of the three guides was given a tongue in cheek feel with their macho persona's. I enjoyed the DVD but would have to say if anything it was a but too short and not in sufficient detail for me. I think I was expecting more of a documentary type DVD rather than a travel blurb which was essentially what it was. Then again it did say that so maybe my expectations were too much."
1,very disappointing,"Reading the first review i decided to buy this DVD but, frankly, it doesn't show the heart of this beautiful city: not even one shot about Ocean beach, Castro, Twin peaks, the mexican area and San Francisco by night is completely missing.I also find very boring the same view of the car, the yacht and helicopter."
5,"The more things change, the more they stay the same","If you've closely followed the ups and downs of the stock market, and the downs (and downs) of the reputation of the financial industry, you will deeply enjoy this. Brooks gives great detail and personalizes the crash of 1929, it's aftermath, and the reaction of the investing public. Eerily familiar to much of the tone of the last few years.Two highlights for me are the passionate defense of short selling by Whitney, and how J.P. Morgan's image was transformed virtually overnight by one very humanizing photograph."
4,An important read for regulators,"This book documents exactly how lack of regulation and lack of protection from shortsellers was such a serios contributor to the stock market crash. Unfortunately nobody in the SEC read this book 5 years ago or we won't be in the mess the market/casino is in right now. Shorts like Joe Kennedy targeted specific companies and drove them into the hands of competitors or out of business, sound familiar? A few other reviewers mentioned how there was a massive short squeeze in Stutz stock, the rest of the story is the guy that pulled it off was barred from the exchange because the leaders of the exchange had been short and lost money. 5 or 10 years from now we will find out who was behind this massive transformation of the competitive landscape and don't be surprised if it is the banks/brokers that appear to be the 'survivors' right now."
3,its ok i guess..,"i love sttw, but this book is average.its about sabrina broke a mirror and she has 7 yrs of bad luck, but instead its 7 days since shes a witch. but its long, so sabrina goes through these different things until her bad luck vanishs but its all a lesson by her quiz master. some parts of the book were good but others bore me. good book if your not lazy."
3,Carwin Is Back!,The main thing I liked about this fight card is seeing Shane Carwin make his return win or lose. Overall the main card was decent. The real co-main event should've been Sam Stout vs Yves Edwards which was on the prelims. They've more notereity and this was the best fight on the card from top to bottom in my opinon.
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"This book continues Sharazad Ali's sad tradition of whacked out, mean spirited pseudoscience and pseudohistory that appeals only to extremely bitter and half educated African-American social rejects looking for an outlet for their misdirected anger.Essentially, the book is a series of quizzes that imply that any Black American who has any positive encounter with Whites are still slaves. One particularly outrageous Q&A states that any Black person who laughes at a White man's joke is still a slave (so does this mean that I belong in the cotton patch for laughing at Jakcie Gleason and the Honeymooners)?A good subtitle of this book (as well as Sharazad's other epics of nonsense) should be ""The Miseducation of a Negro"" (with apologies to Carter G. Woodson)."
3,Slave Mentality,I was moved by the title enough to go out n buy the book. I still perm my hair so I am still a slave in that respect. I look like my brother with an afro so I permed it immediately. My skin is still black n that makes me what I am -black n proud! I know who I am and no conditioning can stop my rise. Still I rise!Labeling the author (for at least starting the conversation) isn't necesary.Hotep!
5,A Dyer's Garden,"This little book is a ""huge"" gem of information. First of all the format is perfect, small, note-book size and fits your hands well.It also is well designed and very info accesibleIt has everything from plants history, growing and harvesting procedure to dying techniques with materials and illustrations. I have several other dyeing books and this one is superior and attractive. I bought this one and also received one as a christmas gift// I shall keep them both. with one for me and one to share with other fiber artists....thank you !!!!!!"
5,love the book,"we rented part 4 at the library just to see if we liked it. the boys ended up really loving the stories of the young jack sparrow. i ordered this book for my nine year old son. he loves it so much, he hasnt been able to put it down. this is the first of the pirates series."
1,Where's the rest?,"The page for this item says ""12 per pack"" in three different places, so when I placed the order I expected to receive 12 Mesh Bags. However, I only received one. Be wary, purchaser. If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is!"
5,great book,I am an Interior Design major and my professor recommended this book for the use of Prismacolor markers. It gives you great advice on how to render (coloring using the Prismacolor markers to show colors and shadows) and different techniques so you can get the effect you want.
4,Great for beginners,This book is a great resource for anyone wanting to learn how to render. Detailed descriptions of method and proper media drastically shallows the learning curve in hand drawing.A MUST HAVE FOR ART/ARCHITECTURE/INDUSTRIAL DESIGN STUDENTS
3,Positive,I ended up not needing this book but by the time I found out it was too late for me to return it. The book itself was pricey but in good condition.
1,"Very, very small","I bought this as an extra book for my son since this is one of his favorite stories. I had no idea the book would be smaller than a dollar bill. It is a great story, but you need to buy a bigger book than this one."
5,Lovely,"Eric Carle is the favorite author for me and my sister. His illustrations are lovely and just perfect for the stories. We enjoy reading his books again and again. It is a real joy for us.This is very simple reading about a caterpillar who eats throughout the whole week. We love the brightly colored pictures on each page and repetitive phrases in this book. This book belongs to each household. We also likeBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?andWhy Some Cats are Rascals ( Book 3)"
5,Loved by Children,I teach preschoolers. They love this story and the plush toy. I aide in the Kindergarden class. The children learn about the cycle of a caterpillar. The kids still love the story.
1,The size of the book is extremely disappointing,This is not the full size book that you see in the stores. More like 4 x 6. Huge disappointment!
2,Hungry catepillar,"I was expecting a larger book, but it is basically a small baby book. It was not what I was looking for but someone with a very young (0-1 year) child may use it."
5,favorite book in an age-appropriate form,"I loved this book as a child and was thrilled to find it offered as a board book for the littler ones who I think would enjoy it, but might destroy thin paper pages. A classic."
5,Second generation caterpillar fans,"I remember reading this book as a small child, but not in the board edition. In the book we had, you had to be careful when you touched the holes in the pages (let's face it, no child can resist that) because the thin paper would tear. However, it's always been a magical story about growth, transformation and the perils of too much junk food.Now I'm the mother of a toddler who LOVES caterpillars. This book was a no-brainer gift for her and imagine how pleased I was to find it in board form. What a brilliant idea! Tiny fingers can poke into the holes chewed by the caterpillar with no harm done. This book lives in our diaper bag, except for the 3-4 times a week we pull it out and read it at bedtime. A must have!"
5,What's Not to Love?,"I admit, this was and is one of my all-time favorite board books for the very young. I do recommend the hardcover version, only because it will be well-handled if your children are anything like mine were. They will be compelled to stick their fingers in the holes left by that peskily hungry caterpillar, who eats his way through everything in sight!The caterpillar's face is just captivating. I love it. And he eats, and he eats and he eats...and at the very very end, he becomes a beautiful butterfly! It's just the best illustration of metamorphosis in the world. But I have to warn all scientifically oriented parents out there: My two children were singularly UNimpressed with the butterfly and the fact that the caterpillar had become this beautiful creature! They liked him just as he was! Go figure, right? For whatever reason, they--and I--adored this book."
3,Book was just not what I expected.,"This was to go with other Eric Carle items as a gift set. I did not expectit to be such a pretty item and with as few pages as it had. Had I seen itfirst I would not have invested in it. My grandchild will use it and it willbe enjoyed, but Grandmother was disappointed."
3,Miniature Edition...,"Wow when it says miniature edition it means miniature.... Great book though, I remember it from when I was a child. Just wish I would of purchased the bigger sized book. {which I probably will} Size is why only 3 stars. Im sure when I purchase the larger size book I will definetly rate it 5 stars..."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"This book was not what I expected from the description. price is much to high for type of book received, there have to be better choices for this wonderful, classic story."
3,Smaller than expected,I guess I should have read the small print a little better because thats how it came a pocket size version of the book which is good for short trips or out to eat but was thinking it was the full size.
2,Be careful...,"When ordering this book, for a small child, I believe the mini-hardback book is probably better. I accidentally ordered the larger version, and I think little kids will probably be scared of the giant eating insect inside. I was not warned, so I'm warning you. Also, I've seen WAY better constructed pop-up books. This one looks like it was designed bay a beginner in the science of pop-up art."
2,Great Book - long wait,"I ordered this book as a baby shower gift. I ordered it exactly 10 business days prior to the shower. My book came in 1.5 weeks later. I had to buy a different book at Borders for the shower. This book is great, however - just not getting it almost a month after it is ordered."
3,Ok for counting.,This book tries to teach counting. I use it regularly with my daughter and she usually runs out of patience before we finish the book and just closes the book and moves on to another book.
5,Eric Carle is the best kids' author since Dr. Seuss!,"My daughter and I discovered Eric Carle by accident, but since then have created our own library of his books. His illustrations are lovely and just perfect for the stories told. I never get tired of reading his books to my child, and as a parent that is a real joy! I highly reccommend this or any other Eric Carle book to any parent who has a creative or naturally inquisitive child who craves stimulation. Read and become a lifelong fan"
2,Said the book in very good but disappointed.,"Disappointed with the condition of book. I have purchased the book in very good condition from this seller based on good reviews. However, what I received was in not very good but just acceptable. Actually, another book, ""Does a Kangaroo Have a Mother, Too?, in very good condition"" bought from same seller was as said. I am not sure I will get more books from this seller next time."
4,Awesome,"I remember this book from long ago,and it is a keeper. Gets kinda boring halfway through,but it is still an awesome book. Everybody should have this book,great to pull out every once in awhile."
5,Best edition of this story and lots of fun for kids,"I love this edition of the classic story. The book is very well made and easy for my three-year-old to manipulate. The pics are wonderful. Some of the reviews for this book were negative but inacurate. They were not rating the book but instead the service due to they never recieved the book. Others said it was small but unfortunatelly they purchased a miniature edition. This edition, however, is full sized and wonderful."
2,Hungry Caterpillar,"I was disappointed with this item, but that really was my fault. I missed the fact that this was a miniature edition. And when they say miniature they mean miniature."
5,A great classic children's book,"This book is one of those books that will forever have a special place in my heart. It was a childhood favorite throughout my youth and is still a wonderful read today.Excellent for young children, this book is one I'd read to any child without regrets. It is a wonderful story with beautiful illustrations to fit it. It is perfect to help children learn the art of reading and story-telling.This book deserves the positive reviews it gets and mine will add to the ever-growing list of positive reviews from satisfied readers.Few children's books are so interesting for kids, that they carry on to adulthood. This is one of those few, and I recommend it wholeheartedly to those looking for a chance to glimpse back into their childhood, parents looking for books to read to their children, or just anyone who wants to take a look at a classic children's book.This book is for you."
3,caterpillar,"The book arrived on time but was tattered and frayed at the ends and not in ""very good"" condition, as listed."
5,Wonderful Read For Little Ones!,"Even though I'm a little skeptical about modern baby boardbooks, but I received this as a present and I LOVED it. It's not just a plain narrative, the colourful illustrations and the imaginative board ""mini-pages"" that help kids count as the caterpillar eats through the book, makes it a fun read.Plus my son (who is only about 4 months old) loves looking at the vivid pictures in it and I love reading the book to him^_^"
3,great story,I thought that The Very Hungry Caterpillar was a great story. It is a great book for kids of all ages. When I was little I read lots of times maybe everyday so you see its great book. It tells the story of a caterpillar from its birth through its growing but I don't want to give away the ending. The author really Knew what he was doing because he created one of the greatest children's books ever. He used vibrant colors and little words. This book is worth every penny believe me your kids will read it over and over again.
3,Great book...but it's really really small,"There's not much I need to say about this classic. The story is great for kids...except that this book is extremely small. Too small. The text is tiny inside a small book too. I don't recommend getting this, go with the normal size version."
2,miniature?,"Definitely miniature...I am disappointed. I thought it was miniature in the sense of less pages, as in a abridged story, but wrong---be sure to have your glasses with you if your eyesight is a little weak.Could be good for the car? I don't know but I am disappointed with its size and the price I paid for it."
2,Ehhh...,We only paid .99 c for the book and you can tell. It still has another kids name on the front of it. :-(
5,Classic!,"Love this book, it is a must have for every child's library! Such a cute and fun story, we recieved it as a gift at our shower."
5,book,This book will fit in with the author study Eric Carle and the Science & Technology theme of Minibeasts in Term 2.
5,An essential childhood book,'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' is a staple for any child's book collection. All of Eric Carle's books have beautiful illustrations.
2,not what I expected,I was hoping for the entire story as a soft book. It's just a few images with crinkly or flippable items. meant for infants. Was expecting a book my toddlers couldn't destroy so quickly.
2,Hoped for more than 2 minutes distraction?,"Yes it is cute, etc, etc. Frankly I am a little annoyed of how quickly it can be read...not particularly engaging for any length of time"
2,Not that interested,"My baby was just not interested in this book, which was strange because he loves pictures of food. I think maybe he just wasn't interested in the caterpillar since it doesn't really have a facial expression or a face. He loves many other books just not this one, and for the price I was very dissapointed."
2,dirty book,I could not believe that the book I purchased was dirty! I had ordered a new book but I had no time to return it.
3,Not the best quality,"The book was listed in Very Good condition. I would say it was a little less than that. Maybe even ""fair"" condtion. I had to wipe it down a lot when I got it. It was sticky! My baby really loves it though (now that it's clean)."
4,Great gift set for a classic book,"The book itself is one of our all time favorites! The toy is a little small and simple, but the toddlers (we've given it to) seem to love the softness and easy to carry accompaniment to the classic and colorful book. The board book itself is sturdy and well-sized and appears to be well put together and will last. This has been a great gift set to give at showers, and to both new moms and toddlers."
4,A Classic,"This is a classic children's book that every child should have the opportunity to read. Sure, the scientific information is wrong, but the book isn't a science book. It's fiction!"
5,Wonderful kid book!,"This is a very cute book for kids. I started reading bedtime stories to my six-month-old daughter a couple months ago and this is one of my favorites (hers too ... she says it tastes really good :). Not too short, not too long, bright pictures. I would definitely recommend it for a child's library."
5,My son's favorite book,"This has been my two year old son's favorite book for about the last six months. He wants me to read it again and again. He is now learning to count and with each of the fruits he counts them out loud...1,2,3,4,5 oranges. And he always gets excited when we come to the part about the butterfly!This is a must-have for kids one to three years old."
5,From one generation to the next,I remember this book vividly from my childhood visits to the library and just absolutely had to get it for my 8 month old son. We read it together often. Now at ten months he fingers the holes as I read him the story. The different-sized pages make it easy for him to turn the pages. I often catch him wandering back to look at this book out of his entire book collection.
5,Great Book,Lots of color and a great learning tool. I highly recommend this book for young children. My 2 month old stares at the colors as I read to him.
5,Classic,"This book is a classic.I bought it for my Grandson,and he loves it.He now has a little Brother,and he also loves it.You can't go wrong with books,and tis one is a treasure.If you only buy one book,make it this one."
5,Book very suitable for toddlers,"A caterpillar does not feel satisfied until he eats and eats! Then he feels sick, eats a leaf and then feels much better. Finally, he turns into a beautiful caterpillar. This is very simple reading. The author takes us throught a whole week of eating. There are holes made by the caterpillar to show what he has eaten. Illustrations on every page. This book includes big and bright colorful drawings. Also, the different sizees of some pages made it even more interesting."
2,the book is very small,Didn't realize this was a mini-version of the book till I received it. It's about the size of an adult's hand (fingertip to palm). Doesn't make the best gift.
5,GREAT BOOK,"This is a GREAT BOOK - my daughter's favorite from 2-3 years (and she still reads it at 4 because she can ""read"" it all by herself)."
3,A Colorful Book,"Have you ever seen a caterpillar hatch out of his egg? In this story, the caterpillar ate a leaf and made a cocoon. What do you think will happen when the cocoon opens? You will love this colorful book!...Trey B."
4,"Good, but Amazon put pricey","My 3-month-old son started to put everything into his mouth. I often read board books to him and he holds and tries to put into mouth. I'm very concerned if the book edge would hit into his eyes or cut his skin. I haveSquishy Turtle and Friends (Cloth Books), but that's too big to hold and one day I found this book at local Babies""R""Us. BPA and Phthalate Free message relaxed me. The book has 8 pages including cover, but size is definitely appropriate for my son's little hands!! They sell this staff cheaper than here. Instead of strawberry, the bookhas Hungry Caterpillar and that's more attractive(a little bit bigger)!!"
5,Favorite Toy,"This soft book has been one of my daughter's favorite toys. She is 6 months old now and has been enjoying it for a while. She likes the crinkly sound the pages make and she likes to put the strawberry ""bookmark"" in her mouth. It is one of the few toys she will sit with quietly for an extended time (~20 min)."
5,"Fabulous, Entertaining, and Educational","Aside from the 'classics' we all read in school, there are a few stand-outs for little ones. This book is on that list. The 40th anniversary edition is simply spectacular. The cover is well-made and glossy for durability. The pages are substantially thick enough to not be easily torn. And the colorful pop-out pictures are fabulous. This book is even better than the one I read to my kids.For a classroom teaching tool, it will capture the children's attention. It's entertaining. As you turn the pages, the story can be used to teach 'metamorphosis'; how a caterpillar morphs into a beautiful butterfly.It brought a smile to the face of one of my grown sons when he saw I was wrapping it as part of a newborn's gift. So many others give baby clothing and paraphernalia. Why not start a child on a lifetime of reading pleasure? Give the gift that starts their own library. The very fabulous, entertaining, and educational pop-up book."
4,Nice learning experience,"This book actually my son, who is 4, read it at school. He loved so much that he kept on reciting the whole story over and over. Nice work."
4,Book,"The book is readable but very used, but what should I expect for it being so cheap? My nephew loves it and I guess that's all that matters."
1,No CD,Book was in good conditions. but CD was missing... Not worth the hassle to do return shipping...Very disappointed with this purchase as my toddler loves this book :(
5,Great gift,I brought this to a book baby shower and it was very impressive due to its size. It has a convenient handle too of course the story and illustrations make this book a classic.
2,For the younger set,"This book was abbreviated in that the whole story was on about 4-5 pages. Then there was the matching game that was for the very young, maybe 3-4 years of age. It wasn't what I was hoping for when I bought it. For the right situation, it would be great!"
3,Classic w/ twist but smaller than expected,"I loved this book growing up and looked forward to giving it to my baby nephew. It definitely stands the test of time with its beautiful watercolor illustrations and unique formatting. However, this package was much smaller than I anticipated. The original book I read was about 11x14 but this book is less than half the size and therefore the stuffed caterpillar is also much smaller than expected. If size does not matter to you - it is a cute combination, but I miss the larger illustrations."
4,MUST HAVE!!!,"This is a great book to read to your toddler. You learn how Caterpillar turns into beautiful butterfly. Pictures are amazing. Eric Carle really have out done himself.Note: to Muslim parents, it does use couple words in it that your might not want to share with your childern as far as what Caterpillar eats but you can replace those words with other kind of meats. Still, I LOVE THE BOOK.A MUST HAVE FOR ALL Babies. Ages 1month-5 years."
3,Too small for toddlers,"I wish I would've gotten the version with the hard pages because it was a gift for a 1 year old girl. I didnt realize it was so small with paper pages. But, other than that, I love the story!"
4,Shipment Delay,"The book was in excellent condition, but we did not receive it until at least a week after all the other items we had ordered were received. They were all going to be mailed to our grandson, so it was a little frustrating to have to wait on this one item."
1,Stunning.,"This book has to be one of the greatest sagas ever told, the story of a caterpillar who eats his way to becoming a beautiful butterfly. I think it's a story we can all relate to.I'm going to give it one star anyway because I just stubbed my toe really hard and damn it, I blame this book."
2,Not good for 22 month olds,"My son loved this book and so did we, until he was left alone with it. Then he decided to pull it apart. Now, it's in the garbage."
2,Rubbish,"This book has seriously hindered my son's development. After reading the book to him religiously before bedtime, he now believes himself to be just like the caterpillar. He claims to be very hungry all the time. He is constantly eating, and is becoming noticeably heavier. Unfortunately in his case I don't believe that he will turn into a beautiful butterfly at the end!"
4,readers beware,"A five star book, in terms of child enjoyment. In fact, your toddler will enjoy it so much he'll pester you every night to have it read again. Since I'm reading, I wish it were a little more clever and less repetitive. Still, a guaranteed favorite for your little Timothy."
5,Great!,"This is an amazing little book that children will LOVE. The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a story you can read over and over and cherish forever. In addition, the plush caterpillar that comes with the book helps little kids enjoy the story more."
2,He ate a leaf and became a butterfly?,"The story is fine for most of the book, it's fun to count the fruit and talk about the food he ate on Saturday, but the transition to Sunday to the leaf to the cocoon doesn't make any sense to me. What does the food have to do with turning into a beautiful butterfly?"
2,Miniature Edition,thought this book was regular size!! not sure i will buy online again when i can purchase at a book store
5,Great Story,I bought this book for my grandson. It is a cute story and sturdy so it should last a long time. I would recommend it to others.
5,Great Children's Book,I ordered this book to use for a Project Linus Book and Blanket Challenge. Some child that has had a trama in their life with appreciate the book and homemade quilt. Project Linus is a wonderful organization and all who participate should be congratulated.
5,My toddler loves this book,"We got this book from the library and my son loves it. We own The Mixed-up Chameleon book, but my son isn't as into that one, maybe it's for kids who are a bit older, as my son isn't quite 2. However, this book seems to be perfect for him, he loves to put his fingers in the holes the catapiller ate into everything. So, I'd say this might be the best Eric Carle book for the young toddlers, esp. since it's not a long story."
3,good but without staying power,"My daughter enjoyed this but only opted to read it 7 days in a row, not the record 121 held by Goodnight Moon. It's an enjoyable tale about the young caterpillar learning about life and growing to maturity as a butterfly. Along the way it learns junk food is bad. It has little holes in the pages representing eaten food and my daughter liked playing with her fingers.As we choose not to expose our daughter to junk food, the pictures of the candy other sweets was a little difficult for me as Rachael sometimes wants to know what it is, then she wants some. Still it provides the opportunity to teach about junk food and its consequences.Highly recommend the board book as it is less destructible then the paper version."
3,Good but not Carle's finest,"The Very Hungry Caterpiller is great for teaching metamorphosis but it is lacking in a few facts..... Caterpillars which wrap themselves into cocoons become moths, not butterflies. The illustration of the butterfly is mysteriously 'top wings on bottom' upside down and my 5 year old reads this and wonders WHY the caterpillar ate so much. For a springboard for teaching it is fine but standing alone it does not do well."
3,Worth it,"I really feel it was not worth our time to read this book. The pictures are cute, but the caterpillar eats fruit, then junk food, then turns into a butterfly. My child couldn't even sit through the whole book and she loves reading. It was not stimulating to her little brain and I was appalled that this book gets such good ratings. There are way better books out there."
3,"Questionable wording...big, fat caterpillar?","My two year old loves it, but is now calling me and his baby brother ""big, fat mommy"" and ""big, fat baby"". It's cute the first few times, then gets a little annoying, and I just hope he doesn't start to generalize. It seems to be a term of endearment for now. I've shelved the book until he moves onto newer, and potentially less offensive descriptive words."
3,Mixed feelings,Young kids like the book for the bright colors and the holes. As an overweight adult I feel conflicted about the book's message that while overeating will make you sick it will also turn you into a something better.
2,Not accurate information,"At the preschool I work at, VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR was read during ""butterfly week"". As a butterfly gardener, and someone who raises caterpillars indoors and releases the butterflies once they've emerged, I was very dissapointed by this book. The real facts of the life cycle of the butterfly are fascinating for any child, but the author chose to write a fictional book on how much caterpillars eat, including all sorts of human foods. Also butterflies do not spin cocoons--moths do. The preschoolers learned very little from this book."
1,Hungry caterpillar,"A beautifully illustrated book based on poor scientific knowledge. Butterflies do not come from cocoons - moths do. When butterfly caterpillars pupate, they do not spin silk to make a cocoon. If you want your child to learn inaccurate science, use this book with them."
2,Too small,"I am kind of irritated because when the description said Miniature, I didn't realize it meant ""smaller than your hand"""
2,more information,"eric carle is always wonderful in each story, however, the size of this book could have been verfied before being sent. I was expecting a regular sized book, but when i got it in the mail, it was about the size of my palm."
4,Cute book,"Was very happy with the book, but disappointed in how long it took to be delivered. It didn't get here in time for the baby shower."
4,I love this book!,"My only qualm is that the book should be a bit bigger so the caterpillar toy can actually eat his way through all the foods... never mind, my two year old adores it anyway."
5,Great Book For Children!,"This book is simple, bun. My daughter loves it and often proclaims 'still hungwy!'. If you can find the book with the stuffed caterpillar, it's very cute. Definitely a must for all children.The only complaint I have is one that most people will probably think I'm crazy for complaining about - a caterpillar spins a chrysalis around himself, not a cocoon. Cocoons are what moths (and certain other insects) spin.So, when you read the book, be sure to say Chrysalis, not cocoon. ;-)"
5,The Very Hungry Caterpillar Board Book,You kids (ages 2-5) are in for a treat as the caterpillar eats and the reader reads through the book. This book has plenty of fingerholes for kids to use when each section is read. Very entertaining for both reader and listener!
5,Children's Classic,"This book is the best edition of this story that I've ever seen. It's really big, with board pages that are easy for even my 11 month old to turn back and forth. Plus, the little caterpillar that comes with it is great to use to make the story interactive."
3,"Wish this was better, not my favorite cloth book.","It's just Ok. I wanted more for the price. It's not very interactive and there are only a few pages. The board book is far better. For cloth books, I will stick with Lamaze."
5,enthralling,sitting down with my favorite 18 month old -- the very hungry caterpillar kept him enthralled and interested and possibly spell bound. I re-appreciated the colors and shapes and images and noticed that the book introduces numbers.
2,poor stiching work,"the baskets are good in size, but the linning is poorly made. It came with the loops falling apart and the ribbons are much darker than shown."
4,Adorable and sturdy,These are perfect for my daughter's nursery to hold diapers and some of her stuffed animals. They are sturdy and I loved how I could pick different bow colors. I recommend these.
5,Loved Them!,"They're a wonderful size if you're looking to use them for diaper, clothes or baby product storage. It's convenient that the ribbon comes in pink, blue and sage to change for future use."
5,"Better all around, than others I've read.","This was the first of a few books on Sigils and Chaos magic, that i had read. It is far easier to read and work through than those b peter Carrol, and I have had some success with the performance and charging of sigils. Just be aware of thet fact thet you need to be specific about what you "" wish for "" you just might get it with a twist If you leave things vague."
4,Excellent Book on the Subject - a little too short,"The book is 130-pages, it could have been a little more elaborate and explain a complicated subject a little more, in detail. Having said that; what is there is great, well written - the author is not a native English speaker, but he writes better with more fluency and context, in a difficult subject, than most American writers do. He is Europe's foremost practical magician and co-CEO of a software company. A side note; One dim-witted person critiqued his other book (money magic) asking how well he has done for himself? Obviously, well enough, if he is a co-CEO. I would read anything this author puts out if I had the time. I have also glanced at his book (High Magick) His other book, I am reading (money magic) is also superb."
4,nice discussion,"I like this book, for it's ideas. The basic concept is to have a very clearly defined intent, and then to turn it into a symbol, so you can drive that intent deep into the subconscious mind. Several different approaches, most based on letters, are used. Dr. Richard Bartlett's book,The Physics of Miracles: Tapping in to the Field of Consciousness Potential, talks a little about using sigils as intent, as doesDowsing and Manifesting, that I know of. I bought this book just after college. I'm thinking this must be updated. It's a lot of fun to play with these. It makes me wonder about corporate logos, and what intent is hidden in them."
4,Great book,"This book was a great read, and it gave me all of the information needed to construct sigils and charge them. It would be great for anybody beginning in Magick. It was short, but it covered almost everything you need to know about sigils. I would definitely recommend buying this book, and giving the sigil magick a try. It didn't work very well for me, but I have learned from experience that it works differently for every person."
5,Its Al JolsOn not Al JolsEn and its wonderful.,"I think the sound is wonderful; it doesn't sound like it was recorded a half a century or more ago. There is none of that tinny sound that old records seem to always have. IMHO there are no technical flaws at all on the recordings.As for the selections, I think if you just want to make one purchase of Jolson recordings (like I did) you can't go wrong. It has a wonderful selection of his hits for what amounts to fifty cents a cut. These are the ones I often sing (in fun) to my sunshine, like April Showers, Mammy, California here I come, etc., etc. These tunes are just great fun. I don't believe there is any equivalent in today's music at all. There is certainly no equivalent to Al Jolson."
4,Simply Irresistible!,"To have Ms. Sala launch the series for ""A Year of Loving Dangerously"" by Silhouette (Intimate Moments)was a wise decision made by the editors. Although, the story is not a full-pledged thriller, readers will be kept entertained by the interaction between the hero and heroine, Easton ""East"" Kirby and Alicia ""Ally"" Corbin, respectively, both operatives for SPEAR ( a top secret agency headed by a man no one sees). It's a toned down ""Mission Impossible"" with a good dose of romance and comedy in between."
4,"great idea, nice device","I wanted to add a TV in my room, but due to space limitation, that I am unable to put a TV next to laptop, and I don't want to run another antenna cable to my roomthis is a great ideaI put the device where antenna plug is located, and use homeplug adaptor to hook up to my home LAN, and watch TV on my laptop through my home LANbesides the great idea, the reception is excellent, it can also pull some stations from NJ which other TV can'twhy I give 4 stars?the only thing I don't like is on full screen mode, that it don't occupy all the screen leaves a HUGE black frame, if I can view full screen ""completely"", then I'll give 100%"
4,a terrific and ingenius piece of equipment,"I have had this now for only 3 days and used it quite a bit. The reason I bought it now is because it does mobile. I have a dell axim x51v and loaded it with slingmobile so I could watch MY tivo Television anywhere there is a hotspot. It works great. The mobile is in beta form now and has a few bugs in it such as freezing, etc. from my computers the thing worked flawlessly. Sure its not super high quality but standard def TV isn't nearly as high as a computer screen so your picture will look pixelated if you expand it too big. But all in all its great. Setup was a breeze and I was up and running in no time. I think Slingmedia has a long career ahead of them."
1,Should be called Suck-box,"The idea is great, and the setup is easy, but i bought this thing to sling TV from a friends house to mine, about 25 miles away. They have a standard DSL connection with ~300kbps upload speeds, and i have a shared T1 with 1.5mbs max download. The picture quality at 300kbps was okay, not the best, but watchable. When the speed dropped down to 200 or so, the quality was terrible. Audio sounded like it was coming out of tin can, and the picture was so blurry and choppy that it was impossible to watch. If you are going to hook this into your LAN and sling TV across your house, it works perfectly. But if you are planning on watching from a remote location, make sure you have at least 512kbps upload speeds."
1,Great idea - too bad it doesn't work,"Been going back and forth with the Sling customer support team for six weeks now and so far haven't been able to get the device to work at all on my home network.In fairness to Sling, my home network is fairly complex with a combination of wired and wireless devices. Still, even when directly plugged into my router with my PC, the Sling software cannot even discover the player.In the meantime, they've come out with a more sophisticated player, but I'm most likely not going to take a chance on it."
5,Slingbox is great!,"This product does all it says it will do. I installed it myself using only their directions and had no trouble. The consumer reporter in the Atlanta area, Clark Howard, suggested it as the wave of the future. It is wonderful and a purchase of which I am very proud."
1,save yourself the stress,recently bought a slingbox as i spend alot of time travelling overseas.went through the set up procedure and phoned support about 4 times but unable to set up remote viewing.i then bought a netgear modem which i was told would be more compatitable but again still did not work.after about 5 hours on the phone over one week talking to slingmedia netgear and my isp provider still unable to set up remote viewing...save yourself the stress and avoid this product!
3,price increases?,I put this in my cart a bit before Christmas. It was < $150. Didn't buy it right away. Each time I signed on the price had gone up $10-15. Finally deleted it.
1,Terrible Product,"Although the technology seemed to be something I would love, I have had nothing but problems with my slingbox. It took many hours and days for their support staff (some who had no clue) to figure out my box was defective. Once they determined this they wanted me to pay to ship my bad unit back and for a new unit to be sent to me. After arguing with a supervisor he told me the best he could do was offer 2 day shipping. I told him this was a gift for Xmas and he should think into shipping it over night. He told me that he could be he wont do it. He would rather lose the customer then to ship out a unit overnight (even with my Credit Card on file to pay for the unit if I never returned the bad one). Basically Sling Media supports stinks and I would not recommend anyone to buy their product unless they feel lucky and hope they will get a plug and play box. Great technology , awful service!"
4,Slingbox first and second impressions.,"The idea is excellent, the execution is flawed. What is not made clear at the time of purchase is that you will need a bridge or gaming adapter as well as a high speed internet connection at home. The adapter should be built into the box.Another disappointing factor is that the quality of the video is almost unwatchable if the connection is not robust. There should be a cache memory built in so that a clear, unchoppy video and sound come through."
5,SlingBox Rocks,"I love this device. My kids love it when I can stream their favorite shows to the laptop while on vacation or camping. It's a great item, and was very easy to setup.I don't know how I got by before I had my slingbox."
5,GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT VALUE,"I usually don't write reviews for products, but this was just to cool that I needed too! The Unit is very well built, it has GREAT Installation software, First-class phone support, and there are NO MONTHLY FEES! It has great quality video and a sleek design. I would recommend this for anyone with a high-speed Internet connection!"
3,Not bad but there are a few issues,"The product does what it promises to do. Setting it up was a little nerve racking but I managed to get through it. I wish the screen clarity was a little better and overall the picture could be a little brighter. Thinking positive however, Im sure we will see those improvements in the future (market share will surely dictate this)."
3,"Don't be misled by reviews--OK, but not great!!!","If you stay on your local network it works great. I can watch TV from the deck on my laptop. However, you need better than 300 kbps up speed to get reasonably adequate video.If connected to my Cable BB, (Comcast)in Grand Rapids, MI, it seems adequate. Cable up speed averages ~ 360 kbps. The Verizon DSL in my home office is limited to 128 up and usually gets 115 to 120. Video is too poor to watch, but audio seems OK.Sling Media needs to work on buffering and pass-thru. No reason why they can't fix these issues."
4,Good item..,"I had some nooks and cranny's I needed to work out with the tech specialist with Slingbox, but once I did works well. I love my gadgets..and this is definately a good one..!"
5,SI FUNCIONA,"Es un excelente producto y funciona bien. Lo tengo instalado en Costa Rica. Al principio tuve algunos problemas, pero adquirí un nuevo router, de los recomendados por Slingmedia y solicité a mi proveedor de internet que abrieran los puertos y listo. Cero problemas. Eso sí, se debe de tener acceso a mas 512 kbs, para que se pueda ver bien fuera de casa. Para aquellos que tienen wireless es una bonita opción para tener tv en cualquier parte de la casa."
4,Sling Media Slingbox Classic,"I have the Slingbox software set up on two computers. A desktop media center and an old, 600mhz celeron laptop. On both machines Slingbox provides good quality video, uniterupted video streaming and good audio. The setup was painless. I was up and running on both machines in less than an hour.Be aware that the device does have its limitations. You will not be able to use this in conjunction with the features of Media Center software and you will not be able to record shows on your hard drive. There may be ways to get your computer to record programs if you are particularly computer literate, but not for the average Joe.Because of these limitaions a give this product 4 stars rather than 5."
5,Take your TV with you everywhere,"This device is perfect for anyone that has to travel a lot. I bought it when I found the discounts offered by Amazon and because I did not want to miss any of the games of FIFA World Cup. And I glad I did it, thanks to this item I could watch all games from work and stay informed all time."
4,Slingbox Review,"One of the best gadget-products I've ever bought. The installation and connection was completely flawless. It worked the first time and has been working since (and I even used the Powerline ethernet adapter to connect back to my router). I have my cable TV on one input and my security system on the secondary input. Using my cellular Data connection on my laptop, I can watch tv or look at my security system from anywhere in the country."
5,Gotta love the sling box,We have our sling box in MD and we live in NC. My husband has it to watch Raven's Football. It is a great product. Customer support is very helpful. You have to have Hi-Speed internet. And we can watch it when will travel.
5,FIGURES IN FABRIC BY LISA LICHTENFELS,"WOW!! ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Everyone in my class wants one!! A teriffic book for all Dollmakers and Collectors.Included in the 160 pages is the Gallery with 37 stunning pictures of different dolls made by Lisa.There is also a ""Progress of a Figure"" section complete with illustrations showing you how to make a Figure.Then comes the ""Evolution in Fabric"" which is a Gallery including many more pictures of Lisa's work over the years.Great book for the Coffee Table !"
1,Am I too old?,"Just got these today. Tried to put them on. Pulled, tugged, did everything I could think of. Couldn't get them on. I'm 73 years old. They look like they should do the job if I could ever get them on. Guess I'm just not strong enough anymore."
1,DONT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY,IN MY PREVIOUS REVIEW I WROTE THAT THE PRODUCT SIZING WAS VERY WRONG. A XXL RASHGUARD WAS REALLY A SIZE SMALL.I TRIED TO RETURN IT & THEY CLAIMED THAT THEY NEVER RECIEVED IT. THEY NEVER REFUNDED ME ANYTHING!!! I WASTED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PLUS THE POSTAGE & TIME TO SEND IT BACK & THEY PROBABLY RESOLD IT. BAD BAD BAD EXPERIENCE.
3,"Good, not great","The back half of the book read too much like a diary, with day-by-day happenings, and would have been better organized around things achieved."
5,our favorite shoes for a picky little girl!,These are great shoes! My daughter has narrow feet and heels and very tiny ankles. These are literally one of two styles of shoes that she can wear without any discomfort or rubbing. Most other shoes give her blisters and raw spots. The medium width is great for kids with skinny feet and heels. They are very well made shoes that are very soft and flexible and she is hard on them but they polish up very well. They are adorable with jeans or skirts and dresses. A must have for a hard to fit foot. I don't know what we are going to do once she gets past the size 8!
2,Disappointing and incomplete,"I am really shocked at the creatures missing from this. It's as if they went out of their way to leave out the most important of Krynn's monsters. So let's see, no draconians, (unless you count that ""noble"" crap), no minotaurs, no bakali, no ogre titans. I could probably let some of those go, but NO DRACONIANS? Seriously, these are critical to the game. Couldn't they have dedicated a few pages to them? Also some of the challenge ratings are way off. Having a CR 8 for a shadow wight, which could annihilate a character in one hit (1d8 charisma damage could kill a lot of fighters) erasing them from existence is ridiculous. I just can't give this book better than 2."
5,Sensitive handling of a difficult subject,"Crimes committed by children are a subject we all naturally find disturbing, but this latest instalment in Michelle Spring's Laura Principal series handles the topic with sensitivity, care and real empathy. There is nothing sensationalistic or superficial about this book, and as with the rest of the series, even minor characters emerge as real, well-rounded people. You find yourself guessing - did Daryll do it? Why did he do it? If not him, then who else might have done it and why? As with human nature, nothing is as simple as it appears on the surface, but you are kept in suspense as the plot is tightly controlled and elegantly resolved. My favorite in a series that just gets better and better."
2,"I liked it, but it leaked","I liked it, it was very comfortable, exactly what I had been looking for.But I woke up wet."
4,For BP,"Hawthorne can lower your blood pressure, maybe 10 points in my case. I took about 8 capsules throughout the day."
1,Absolute Garbage. A waste of money. Don't be fooled.,"This is not music but drech.I bought it, and now I am throwing it out. What a fool I am to believe this is music."
2,just not feeling it,"I love Are You Shpongled?; it's probably my favorite album right now. However, I just don't like this Tales of the Inexpressible. The former is incredibly smooth; the latter uses intentionally weird and disruptive sounds and samples. Sasha's mix of Dorset Perception on Involver is better."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"A magnificent blend of sound, harmonic vocals, and all-around immersiveness. A great-sounding CD that doesn't get old. I highly recommend listening to it!"
5,Masterpiece,"All I can say is that this album is beyond a 5 star album. If you are a human you will like this album on some level. Nothing else i can really say other then to read others reviews, as they all pretty much sum up this album.***********If you want this album at an actual affordable price (around $20) I can tell you where to get it.email me:jguy584(attsymbol)yahoodotttcom"
5,Aural Revolution,"Listening to this is like having your mind torn apart with heaven rushing in to caress your soul. This cd truly is inexpressible and no amount of words would ever do it justice. It has a warmer feel to it than Are You Shpongled. Are You Shpongled has more of an alien and strange vibe to it which while also beautiful is different than this. Tales of the Inexpressible makes you think more of some sort of rebirth in paradise. While an amazing experience in an unaltered state, in an altered it is truly life-changing. I can't recommend enough to get this cd, this is how music is supposed to be."
5,This is totally mind-blowing...,"I can't say that I am a big fan of ""normal"" trance, like Simon Posford's other project, Hallucinogen. It just always seems somewhat repetitive. Well, Shpongle takes care of that. There is nothing repetitive about this album. In fact, it is anything but repetitive, as it seems to draw inspiration from just about every musical style there is. I love this album even more than ""Are You Shpongled?"", which is absolutely great. IMHO, the highlight here is the flute, which adds a special kind of wistfulness so rarely found in electronic music. Overall, this is an absolutely stellar album!"
4,"Simple, maybe too simple.","UPDATE to my review in 2005: phone still working perfectly well after almost 6 years of use! Battery performance maybe 60% of what it was when the phone was new.ORIGINAL review:If you want just a phone and nothing else, this might be the right one. But after even relatively simple V300 this phone seems like a phone for second graders - huge fonts, limited functions, etc.Funny thing - if you have high cheekbones it's rather uncomfortables."
4,Good,"I've only had the phone for a week, but it works better than the Nokia I had before. I haven't had any problems w/ it so far."
2,Poor phone design - Hurts to use!,"I am totally disappointed with the physical design of this phone. When I have it held to my ear, the silver edge that sticks out actually digs into my cheekbone. Just enough that after a short call it leaves a red mark and an indentation. After a slightly longer call the mark is actually really sore. Why the need for the sharp edge? Otherwise, it works fine. I'm finally buying a different model after suffering with this one for three months. It's really a silly design."
3,Bad sound if reception is weak,"I'm not too imporessed. I've had the phone for 5 days now. I had a Nokia 6800 before this that would give good sound (hearing people, people hearing you) even if the signal was weak (one or two bars). When the signal is weak with this phone, I can barely hear people (their voices braak or sound garbled) and they can barely hear me. So this phone is going back. Note that the phone picks up the signal at the same number of bars when compared to my old phones, its just that it can't handle the sound unless its a strong signal."
4,Very good phone...plus it actually works,"After my motorolla v180 acting up on me and freezing all the damn time, I had to get a new one and the samsung x495 doesn't disappoint. The only bad thing about this phone is that I can't access the internet...dunno why. Reception is great, and the battery life is long-it charges in two hours which is really great. So far I can go anywhere and still have excellent reception. The speaker phone is superb, not loud and muffly, it is so clear, but you have to use it with the phone openIt is sleek and small, very nice to carry and show off. It's the perfect girl phone hehe :) If you are looking for a basic phone that actually works, this is the phone you have been waiting for!!!!!!"
1,sooooo bad!,"what a waste of money! it doesnt plump/inflate lips at all. nice color but thats all, lipsusion sucks too. cant seem to find a great lip plumper!"
4,Solo Stan,"Before he became Oliver Hardy's partner in 1927, Stan Laurel had starred in and directed many films on his own. This set has several good films on it. Some of the best are : The Soilers, Stan plays a prospector in Alaska. Oranges and Lemons, Stan plays a fruit picker and causes mayhem. Postage Due, in which Stan causes mayhem by just mailing a letter. Roughest Africa, where Laurel is a professor on an African Safari, and manages to anger some wildlife. Several of the films feature James Finlayson as a nemeis to Stan. Fin would play similar roles in several Laurel and Hardy films. As as been noted, Stan had a hard time finding a character that worked for him during his solo career. But I recommed getting this set to see a comic legend in development. And the prints used are in excellent shape."
4,It Would Have Five if it included MUD AND SAND,"Stan was hilarious in many of his solo films, and this set is worth getting just for DR. PICKLE AND MR. PRYDE, an hilarious sendup of Barrymore's version in which Laurel is actually scary!This disc is beautifully set up with outstanding restorations of rare films. Now if they had only included the Valentino parody, MUD AND SAND...it would have gotten five stars from me.Comedy buffs and fans of the Boys will have to have this one in their collections."
5,Great shorts of what's to come..................,"I've been a BIG fan of Laurel and Hardy,ever since I was little and that's going on 30-something years now and I never tire of them,like so many teams that came out after them.These shorts may not be as solid as the ones he did with Oliver Hardy,but they do show what a genius Stan really is and that he was just as good(if not better)as Chaplin or even Keaton when it came to writing gags.Of course all of his shorts are not included here(some are on the Lost Laurel and Hardy dvd's),but this a must-have for any person that loves Laurel and Hardy or anyone that loves true comedy!! If I had to quibble,I wished there were extras like the Keaton box set that Kino on Video came out with a few years back,but I'm not disappointed in this 2-disc set....GIVE US FANS MORE,PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Time typical MTV-Metal,"This is a very mediocre Krokus effort. Even `tho it's not awful, it sure lack inspiration and enthusiasm. The songs are kind of a blue print for heavy metal without heart and soul. I like ""Wild love"", but the rest of the material is nothing to be excited about. I believe this record came out in 1987 and that might explain a lot. Maybe the guys in Krokus thought they were doing the right thing (you gotta make a living, right?) but with hindsight it's obvious that time haven't been kind to this album, like so many from the same era. Mostly for dedicated Krokus fans or lovers of what can be described as MTV-metal in the shape of Winger and Ratt."
1,DEFEATED ME!,"I hate to admit that I've been defeated by a book, but this one did it. I absolutely could not finish it. While the premise was good enough, and the opening engaging, the plot's jumps in time were badly handled and the story really began to drag early. I can't for the life of me imagine what Kennedy was thinking when this otherwise good author came up with such a mishmash!"
4,What's more famous - Mercedes itself or this artist?,"I don't know, a great album. Heard a song on a streaming Internet radio channel (""Tree House of Love"" - some other songs too a little Michael Jackson-ish, or a bit like Prince).Well worth the album, including some bonus tracks. Most people probably have never heard of Blue Mercedes. (The name of the artist and the name of the album mean the same thing = expensive and valuable!)The price (for when I bought it here on Amazon) was well worth the turnout. Most of the songs are excellent, although sounds more like comedians (talking rather than singing). Also sounds a little voice-over-ish to me.Given 4/5 stars for overall good selection of music, but somewhat obscure and copies/downloads are difficult to find.This music is from 1986 or so (if you are into obscure 1980s music, you might give this a try)."
2,Skepticism Is Not Welcome Here,"Skeptics beware. The author is quite clearly annoyed with skepticism and it shows. Even past the introduction, there are quite a few jabs aimed at them. The author should note that not all skeptics are close-minded and unmoving in their positions. If the evidence is satisfactory, I would say it is quite the opposite. Typically, the ""evidence"" is just not satisfactory when it comes to religious and ""supernatural"" topics. There is nothing wrong with being a critical thinker or dismissing things based on a lack of evidence (until sufficient, satisfactory evidence is found).Unfortunately, I couldn't get past that bias.It made me sad. :("
3,Nothing special and not a must have,"Nice product, but i think its not very important, any soft surface would do, even the hand would do good too."
4,Love this item-- wish it was bigger,Love this item-- wish it was bigger---hope to buy another soon-- works exactly as described. Really enjoyed making flowers with this
1,horrible,"this IS the worse computer ever. I've had problems with this thing since day 1. Click on a file...yeah..be patient..only take about 5 minutes for it to pop up. and the damn thing freezes all the time..my shut down won't even work sometimes so i have to turn it off by hand,which can corrupt files (happened once..had to restart my whole computer) they say the Blaster worm is actually a worm but i think its just a glitch in the system cause i had it AGAIN after i restarted it, i've had troubles just to get on here and write this review because of all the annoying glitches and slowness of it. i dont even have 1/2 of my hard drive filled..ive checked for viruses, and i defraged and cleaned it up..so dont say its going slow becuz $hit on my computer..please steer away from this thing, go get a good brand..such as a sony..thats what im getting next a Vaiothank you for reading this...just..please dont make the same mistake i didbye-bye"
2,No nudity,"If you are thinking of buying this, you should be aware that it includes absolutely no nudity or sex. It does have some graphic violence, if that is what you like."
3,original idea,"I liked the connection between the two main characters. The idea is quite good, alas the acting and the story could sometimes do better. Anyway, worth seeing."
2,"Don,t bother!!!!","I ordered this movie,having never seen it. Once is more than enough. It was just an all-around dud. It might appeal to some people,but it just didn,t grab my interest. Buy at your own risk."
2,Good Live Folk Album,"A Live CD from artist Steve Bell. Has some great musicians on the album. This is a Folk album and has some great lyrics and songwriting. I like Bells studio albums a little beter but a decent live album that is a must for fans of Steve Bell. Some interesting stories told between a coupl of the songs. I like the song ""Wings of an Eagle"" ""drumheller Circle""(instrumental) and ""Here By the Water."""
4,En guzel bir album!,"From the beginning to the end, Nilufer enchants you with her hauntingly mesmerizing voice. Her every emotion shines through on this greatest hits album. She can be convincingly bitter, happy, or profoundly sad. This album encompasses many of her successful stlyes from pop to traditional. I highly recommend this Turkish diva, not only to fans of Turkish music, but to those who love to hear a unique vocalist with a truly beautiful voice."
4,Fiction That Makes You Want To Check Your Insurance Policy !,"This new 232 page novel is really quite interesting. It is written by two veteran investigators under a pseudonym. I found it to be a real thriller, as a crime fighter battles insurance industry corruption. The insurance agent thinks that he has found the perfect crime and goes to any length (including murders made to look like accidents) to get his share of the insurance loot. ""Death Benefit"" is written in an easy to read narrative style that lets you examine the minds of both the cat and the mouse. Not only is this work of fiction interesting, but it can encourage you to look at your own real life insurance policies and your dealing with insurance agents. Well worth the reading."
3,Not the worst but not the best,They did the job okay but were not as absorbent as they could be. My home made ones are softer and absorb more than these.
1,Don't buy them. Poor Quality.,"I purchased these thinking that they would be good, but when I received them, they are SUPER thin and really poor quality. I was going to return them but when I called the company about returning them, they said that I had to pay again for the return. So the total cost of the cloths were a little over $8 and then I paid $4.99 for shipping then they want me to pay again for the return again. Not worth buying these at all. If you really want good quality affordable burp cloths get the Gerber organic cloth diapers and use them as burp cloths. They are AWESOME! Too bad they don't make them in any cute colors or designs."
1,Tiny- teeny teeny tiny!,"I wish the seller had included some kind of dimensions into the description. Using a good magnifying glass, I see the charm is well made and actually quite pretty. I ordered four and decided to sew them onto tote bags to give as gifts to friends who are fans of theatre. For something like that, as a ""decorative piece"", these worked out. However, I would never give these as a stand alone gift!"
4,Fine Comic from Bagge,"Fine satire on a middle class family in 1980's America. This is not crass underground stuff. It is neat stuff.It was a different world when cd's were beginning to infringe upon vinyl, home computers and mobile phones(which were HUGE) were VERY expensive and thusly rare; and dvd's were nonexistent.Excellent P.Bagge laughs in this comic material."
2,Bottom come unclude,The bottom started to come unglued the first time I used it other than that it would work fine. I would like yal to send me another one or my money back
4,Good product,very good product it serves the purpose and easy to use even for my 86 year old mother. will buy another for me......welll maybe something that my hubby wont be tempted to use like hmmmmmm a bottle of dishwashing detergent or a vacuum safe...
5,Very impressed,"Very impressed with the design/construction. Other than the fact the product doesn't work (which is expected), the can looks like the original. Great for keeping things out of sight."
3,Different cans from different sellers,"The one I received looks completely different from the one pictured by amazon...perhaps the can is from a different era of Barbasol, but it's taller and yellow, whereas the advertised product is a blue and red, squat-shaped can. You can see the differences from the pictures that I uploaded. There is a side-by-side comparison of the one I purchased previously through amazon (blue and red, with plastic packaging), and the one I just received from the amazon seller, Smoke Mart (yellow with no packaging)."
3,Hide your money,"You can hide your money or small documents when traveling. Very inconspicuous right in front of the maid,visitors or burglers.No need to pay to rent a hotel safe. However after several years usuage the screw in bottom of the can apart and was not repairable."
4,Barbasol Can Safe,"The screw bottom is great, not flimsy as all (the Soda can safes have horrible screw bottoms). I wish they would have weighted the can a bit or put a little bit of shaving cream to shoot out, give it a feel for a can of shaving cream, but for the price I really didnt expect it to do that.I have seen some people complain about the interior smelling, I did not have that problem.People also need to realize that this is a Deterrent Safe. Not a Safe. There is not locking mechanism. This is meant to hide your valuables, not protect them.These products are great for college students, for people who travel a lot and don't trust housekeeping, or even as a gag gift."
1,Poor,"Bottom screw-on lid was loose when received and broke off 2 days later. Probably not just a manufacturing error, but a poor designed product as tried super gluing lid back to screwing part just to see it break again a few days later."
5,Xmas gift,This was a Xmas gift for my little brother. It was a hit! No complaints here. Hope he enjoys it.
4,Dino DNA,This is where I keep my dinosaur DNA for future harvesting. I will create a Dinosaur Island.I gave it just four stars because it doesn't work. I really need to shave.
1,Smells like toxic chemical,"The product is a neat idea, but the inside of the can smells like a toxic chemical. It's probably the foam padding. Don't get this if you don't want your jewelry or money or whatever else to smell like a toxic chemical. For me this item is unusable. I tried leaving it open for several days to air it out, but that was no help.More and more of the things we buy smell terrible, and I just wonder whether it has to do with fact that nearly everything we get now is made in China, and China is one of the largest consumers of recyclable material, and in some cases the process to retrieve usable materials is extremely toxic. I believe this product was assembled in the USA, but I don't know where the foam padding came from.Regardless of where this particular item was made, and regardless of whether the material is literally toxic, the fact is that it smells terrible and anything you store in it will smell the same. I really wish manufacturers would stop using foul smelling material."
2,Burglars have access to Amazon...,"Lets see, if I were a burglar, where would I go to figure out where everyone hides their stuff?In two seconds any 2-bit robber will realize that it will always pay to pick up any can of barbasol, ajax or fruit cocktail...Even books...it would pay to just dump all books you see on the floor, the one that dumps your cash and gold is the jackpot!Seriously folks...think..."
2,"Love the talking CallerID, the multiple charging stations and the quality loud speaker phone.","Love the talking CallerID, the multiple charging stations and the quality loud speaker phone. But sometimes the whole system wigs out and no phone calls can come in. Once you finally figure out that this happening (from relatives texting you why they can't get through) you have to pull the power cord and plug it back in to get it working again."
1,Garbage Used Phone,"Love the 5.8ghz panasonic phones but you cant find those anymore and the 6.0 are garbage, so much hssssssssssssssssss sound in those. So I decided to buy a used one. I paid almost $12.00 on shipping and the product was 35.99 I believe. It came to me dirty(filled with crumbs and dust), prior owners address book and numbers in the caller ID. One phone has no display.I contacted the seller who said he will take it back and gave me a authorization number. But the website says regardless of reason of return I dont get shipping and handling money plus I am responsible for back shipping. So I decided to throw this in garbage and take my losses before someone else is trapped to buy this junk and be in the same situation as me."
5,NICE phones!,"I bought this phone system to replace our 5 yrs old Panasonic 2.4 GHz phones. I'm so glad for the purchase. The phones are much lighter than my old ones, and without the antenna sticking out. Love the different ring tones you can choose for individual callers. Also love the way that it announces the caller so I don't have to rush to the phone. BJs warehouse sells the same set w/the same price so of course I'd buy it from Amazon."
4,Does exactly what I wanted,"We moved into a new place and found we had no phone-jack in the kitchen or by my desk. Rather than string cable everywhere I bought the KX-TG6053S. Problem solved. Reception is good on every unit. The only annoying thing is the stupid voice based caller-id, but you can program that off. I use phone-company voice-mail so I haven't tried the voice-mail feature. Speaker phone works well. Recommended."
1,Much smaller than I expected,"These ear rings are much smaller than I expected, they are very small really. Not suitable for children either because of the size of the ""stick"" which is very long."
4,Strong for Price,"Although this is not as heavy as the OEM belt for my mower (which has to be special ordered), it works satisfactorily and is a good backup."
2,Most recent version of DSI Pro III not compatible with modern software,"I have been using the Deep Sky Imager Pro III as part of an outreach program. We purchased five of these cameras for loaning out to public schools in our local area.We have found the Meade AutoStar Suite and DSI Pro III buggy with little support on Meade's end. Our most recent frustration is that, despite the fact that all of our teachers have brand new computers, we are unable to use these cameras. Meade has not produced any drivers that are compatible with a 64-bit version of Windows 7. There appear to be a few work-arounds (which include buying yourself a Professional version of Windows 7, buying old software, or running a program that emulates an older version of Windows inside of Windows 7).I strongly urge buyers to steer clear of Meade if you use 64-bit versions of Windows 7 or Vista."
3,Yep it's a black bandanna!,"Nice Black Bandanna, 2.99 is a good price but the s&h is over priced. I bought it anyway, sometimes shopping from home is convenient but costly :)"
4,"Nothing extraordinary, but it does the job....","I still feel like this should have come with the MP3, but since it doesn't, it's an excellent thing to purchase to accompany it. The product is basically a AC/Car adapter to USB converter with another USB cable cable for you. If you still have the USB cable that they gave you, it would probably be much better if you just got a regular AC to USB adapter. You'd probably save alot of money that way...."
4,Seems to do what it says,"I've only used the AC adapter, not the DC adapter. But the AC adapter charges my Samsung K5 in about 2 hours, about half the time it would take charging on my PC. Its convenient because if I'm not syncing new music, why should I tie up my PC? Once I only had to charge the player and didn't want to turn on my PC just to do that, so it was quite convenient. The cable that comes with it plugs right into the K5 naturally and is long enough, about 3/4 yard. Tech support is only email based and you have to find a model # to get it. It has a 24 hour turn-around time, excluding weekends. I wish they would've included a carrying case; that's what prompted me to drop the rating from 5*s to 4*s. I also don't know when if ever I'll use the DC/auto adapter and wish I didn't need to purchase it. Another reason to reduce the rating. But it works fine."
4,great replacement,I had misplaced all the electronic connections for my Samsung. Amazon is the only place where I found what I needed. I had checked stores but could not find what I was looking for Now I can listen to music again and store my photos.
5,Great Reference!,"This is an amazing text on the culture and geography of the world! There is an introductory unit, Africa unit (which I am on), South Asia, Southeast Asia; Australia; and Oceania, and many others. It really helps you understand it clearly. It is a great text to refer to if you have any questions about culture and geography. In each unit there is a section on the geography and early histry, a seciton on the heritage, and a section about the place in transitition, and it in the world today, if I remember correctly. Wow!"
2,Doesn't belong in a high school,"I am currently a junior in an advanced placement history class, and my freshman year this book was my text for a supposedly accelerated class. The book is incomprehensive and the analysis of important historical concepts is poor. The book spends a paragraph on covering communism. The entire textbook only has one paragraph on communism! It is a wonderful text for middle school students; however, it does not belong in my high school, or any other for that matter."
1,this book SUCKS,I am currently a freshman in high school and i am required to take world geography. this is the book we are using in that class and i hate it! the book is written in a dull and boring manner and the chapter reviews are long and horrible. they just have us memorize the information and do not teach us anything. find another book cuz this one is AWFUL!!
4,Excellent,We received the necessary book for my daughter to complete the course she was taking on-line. It was received with-in 5 days of ordering. Thank you very much!
2,help,Was told that I would get my book no later than today. I still have yet to recieve it. Any help?
5,Pioneering in the 20th century,"This is a wonderful story that takes place just prior to WWII. It starts out with the family living in a big city, in a modern apartment with all the latest gadgets. The grandmother, who lives with her son, daughter-in-law, and two grandchildren, would like to move back to a farm, but knows she can't by herself. Just as the story opens, the father has lost his job and isn't sure what to do next, but decides to take his family on a vacation at a new lakeside vacation home development. On the way his mother tricks them into going to an estate auction at a farm. While there the father unintentionally buys the farm. They decide to stay for awhile and see how they like it. The rest of the book tells about all the experiences they have on the farm. It is a very good picture of what farm life was like in the late 1930s and a heartwarming story about the interactions of these city slickers and their new farming neighbors."
2,Not as good as Gleim,"I bought the Wiley CPA review but returned it after comparing it to the red Gleim CPA review and realizing the Gleim CPA review is better. I thought the explanations at the beginning of each chapter in Wiley were poorly formatted and unclear, whereas Gleim was much easier to follow and learn from. The Gleim book also told you if the sample questions came from the CPA, but the Wiley book never says where any of the questions came from. I did get one simulation on FAR that only Becker had, but Becker costs way too much. Given the choice, I'd go with the Gleim."
3,ST - Starfleet : Year One,"Well, now we know the rest of the story as Paul Harvey would say. As the beginning of the UFP and Starfleet, we get a pretty good picture of what's in store for this fledgling. As books go, this is called a filler a book to fill in gaps and that's about it.Starfleet: Year One is unrelated to the events depicted in the television series Enterprise. It says that inside on the very first page. But as this is a story that needs to be told, Michael Jan Friedman has done an excellent job of it.Good character development, plot lines and is plausable. This is a really fast read a one nighter. So if you want to find out how it all began in the Trek world... read this book.But remember there is no continuity with any series. So, if you are into Trek you'll probably like it, all others, pass it by it's not worth the money."
4,Faithful to the Trek Mythos,"Fans of Star Trek have been following the various shows now for over 30 years. For those who were fans prior to 1993, this book is a breath of fresh air. Michael Jan Friedman, like Peter David, understands the Trek universe and how to use its vast resources to weave a very enjoyable novel that is consistent with the estabished history of the ""Trek"" universe. Alas, the current TV series, Enterprise, does not. If you enjoy DS9, Voyager, or Enterpise more than The Original Series or NextGen, this book probably isn't for you. However, if you want a plausable prequel to the Trek of Kirk's time, check this out. You won't be disappointed."
3,"A good, not great, start to the Federation","Michael Jan Friedman usually writes good science fiction and this is no exception. It is NOT TV's Enterprise but it does address some similar issues and those that Enterprise was reluctant or did not have time to explore. I can understand why the book does not ""pop"" to readers but it is a good read. The Federation, like Rome was not built in a day. There were problems in the fledgling government (much like every new nation when they form a government). The ship designs, particularly the Daedalus, are based off rejected designs for the Original Trek even some character names were from these sources. This book, while a bit light on the action, does tell about some of the growing pains and compromises in the creation of the Federation and the aftermath of the Romulan War"
5,Best Star Trek Novel I've Ever Read,"This entertaining story details the beginning year of the famous Starfleet of the United Federation of Planets. The basic storyline consists of a power struggle between explorers and military leaders-both groups intent on shaping Starfleet to their own needs and ambitions. I really enjoyed this aspect of the story. I also grew quite attached to all of the characters, especially the captains of Starfleet. And at the end, I love how the bickering captains all finally realize that they must work as a team to make Starfleet successful. A great read!"
4,"If you didnt have the patience before, read it now","When this serialized novel first started showing up in 1999, I just didnt have the patience to wait each month. I'm glad they finally collected the chapters into one book.This book begins with the ending of the Earth-Romulan War, and the beginning of the United Federation of Planets. The main storyline is of six captains competing for the command of the U.S.S. Daedelus. Underscoring their competition are two factions who want to direct the future of Starfleet, one wanting it to be a purely military force, the second one for exploration and research.This was a very enjoyable book and a gutsy effort. Dont go into it with the thought it will mesh with Enterprise, because it wont. Thanks for MJF and Pocket for filling out an early portion of Star Trek history. I'd like to see even earlier novels based on the Earth-Romulan war, or a year two."
4,This Christmas Movie Should Be On DVD!,"I didn't grow up watching this Christmas movie and didn't see The Night They Saved christmas until last Christmas of 2004 and I Liked the movie and thought it was entertaining and the acting was pretty good, especially from Jaclyn Smith, Paul Le Mat and Mason Adams. The movie is about a family living in The North Pole where the father played by Paul Le Matt works for an oil company and they are drilling for oil in The North Pole hoping to find oil but unfortunately they are putting Santa and his workshop at risk and an Elf played by Paul Williams comes and brings the wife played by Jaclyn Smith and her children to the North Pole to meet Santa played by Art Carney and to see the damage that the oil company is doing and to get them to help get them to stop drilling in their area and to save Christams deliveries, etc. This is a cute movie and I would like to see it put on DVD!"
5,"Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus","I am one of those people that love Christmas so much that I listen to carols year round. It's not the gift giving as much as the spirit in the air. This movie shows that there is more to Christmas than gifts, it's about believing and helping each other out. I have been watching this movie every year since I was 7 or 8 and it never gets old."
5,The Best Christmas Movie Around,"Okay I'm the first to admit that i may be a bit sad but I love this movie. I have watched it every chrismas eve since i was four (I'm now 21!). It is totally magical the way christmas should be! Not a story based on commercial hype, just magic! I only wish i could get this video on English VHS format!"
3,The Night They Saved Christmas,Product arrived quickly. It was in decent shape considering how old this movie is.
5,My son's favorite holiday movie,"I taped this movie from TV when my son was small. Somehow, it was accidentally taped over and he (who is now 19) was really upset. I was so glad to find it on Amazon. COM!!! It helps continue one of our family holiday traditions."
1,They took me.,"I brought this DVD, and it was advertise as a new one. It was a copy and doesn't even play. False advertisement. My only regret is we didn't watch it right away,, I waited way too long.IN their advertisement said it was not open. Wrong, the DVD came with a plastic container, but the DVD itself was in a paper container place inside the plastic box. Never again!"
1,False advertising,This was a HUGE disappointment! It took several weeks to receive the DVD--faster service was not offered. Then to have the DVD be a poor quality boot leg copy that doesn't play on any legitimate DVD player. All 4 machines that I tried to play it on could detect that it was an illegally made DVD and therefore would not play. Waste of time and money.
1,BE CAREFUL to read all print before you order!,"Sadly I ordered this dvd which I have wanted for years, the price was great so I thought, I bought this with much anticipation knowing my children will finally get to see this movie around Christmas. When it arrived I told my children you will be watching this soon then I tried the dvd which I always do when I buy one to be sure it works no skipping, etc. to my suprise there was a big blue screen that said ""CAN NOT READ"" then I went back to Amazon to read all about the dvd and found.. ""will only play in zone 2"" something to that affect. It cant be played in the USA.. well I never would assume that where it was being sold in USA I would have thought it would be able to work in the USA! To send it back would cost more shipping which I already paid to send it here.. it would end up costing me more to send it back so im stuck with a dvd that wont work that I paid for, I will never order dvds from here again! I never had this problem with Ebay!"
1,"Stink, Stank, Stunk",Ive been looking for this movie for years. Its one of my favorites growing up as a child. However coma quote this form of dvd doesn't play on american movie players. I'M SORRY BUT IF YOUR SELLING MOVIES IN AMERICA IT SHOULD PLAY ON AMERICAN DVD PLAYERS. I wasn't looking to see if it was compatible with some random dvd player in Europe. I was very upset and there was nothing they were willing to do about it. Very unsatisfied and will not be making that mistake again.
1,The Night they saved Christmas,"DVD would not play - ""cannot play"" appeared on the player screen. I returned it ($4.80 postage) and asked for a replacement and a refund of the return postage since the DVD was faulty. I have now be informed I will get a refund for the cost - none of the postage since ""some DVD's do not play in some regions"". This is bunk and I am reporting it to the attorney general's office - sounds like a scam to me! I will NOT be willing to purchase additional items thru Amazon again!"
4,Childhood memories,This movie does an excellent job of mixing great performances with nice effects. Each character is believeable and lovable. If you had lost your faith in Santa Clause and his helpers this movie will help you renew it. My siblings and I watched this movie each Christmas season for many years growing up. Because my siblings and I no longer live together we seemed to miss it when it showed on television the last couple of years. We've been looking for it on VHS and you've brought it back to us. Thank you!
5,THE MOVIE SHOULD BE ON DVD!!!,WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WE WOULD LOOK FOR IT ON TV.NOW THAT I'M OLDER I WOULD LIKE IT ON DVD BECAUSE EVENTUALLY WHEN I HAVE KIDS I WOULD LIKE THEM TO SEE THE MOVIE.IT IS A REALLY GOOD CHRISTMAS MOVIE FOR ANY AGE AND IT PUTS YOU IN THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.SO I HOPE IT COMES OUT ON DVD!!
5,The Night They Saved Christmas,One of the best TV made Christmas movies that I have had on VHS for years since it's release and finally found the DVD..This is one magical movie that really makes you believe that Santa really does exist.
4,Kerosene Wick Replacement,"Product properly fit, however, I had to disassemble unit several times to get the proper height adjustment. Directions were helpful and clear, it's just a difficult task and may take several attempts to get right adjustment."
3,What should we do with a book like this?,"As a radical feminist I have to say that this book shocked and horrified me in many ways. While incredibly courageous and brilliant, diverse voices are enriching contemporary feminist discourse (especially the fantastic Mary Daly, Jane Marcus, and Susan Faludi), we sometimes find that a few women are left behind, complaining that feminism has been unfair to *them*! Well, feminists HAVE addressed the issue of children and how difficult it is for women to have to tend to them while finally giving herself the greatest gifts of all: identity and freedom. Perhaps Roiphe has fallen behind the times; other feminists are steaming on ahead!"
1,Tepid coffe maker that broke after 4 months,I bought this coffee maker four months ago and it has already given up. It has had very little use. The coffee it made was tepid but I don't have to worry about that anymore.I won't be buying another Black and Decker product if I can avoid it.
5,A GEM OF A MOVIE,"A beautiful film detailing the seamy side of Buenos Aires nightlife, the kind that flies under the radar of most tourists. Cozarinsky is a great director; a pity there are no more of his movies on DVD. Heredia is a stunning Garcia Bernal look-alike in more ways than just his looks. I wish for a movie where they would play brothers! Some complain about no plot; in the picaresque mode, we follow the protagonist, not the story line, since he provides it. The best accolade. I rented it first, and I have just added it to my DVD collection."
2,Pointless,"I understand what this movie was trying to do and the genre it was approaching. But, in my opinion, it failed. A better example of the picaresque genre isLazarillo de Tormes(novel) orFear and Loathing in Las Vegas(novel or film).The film failed to establish a plot, a relatable or sympathetic hero. There really was no plot in this movie. It is merely a collection of snapshots of the streets in Argentina. A lot could have been done with this movie and there were plots that could have been investigated but, we get nothing. Even understanding all the political references in the film and getting the theme of the movie, I found myself willing the movie to end. I even fast forwarded a few times. There is just no plot, not not even an undeveloped one.I don't think a general audience would like this movie, in my opinion. A better audience for this film would be those interested in the picaresque genre."
1,"strange, rambling journey through the night","What a strange film! The movie follows Victor, a street hustler in Buenos Aires, through a night of seemingly random encounters with all sorts of characters, none of which are tied in with each other. There is no plot. At moments, the action is surreal and you are not quite sure if Victor is having a drug-induced hallucination or if it is a real person or experience he is living through. Victor just wanders the streets and random things happen. Then the movie ends as he continues walking. Nothing leads to anything or any conclusion. Very wierd."
4,Good Product,My husband and I have been taking the Total Mins for many years and were happy to find it for less here than our local health food store.
3,Horse Pill for Humans,"While I do agree that this is the best iron-free mineral complex out there,I lend this caution to anyone who has trouble swallowing large pills:This pill is large and hard.If it goes down sideways, you're in for a painful choking fit.If it weren't for the size, I'd give it 5 stars.{{* *}}"
5,Cop Show,"I enjoy cop related movies as well as mystery, with this one I found what appeals to me not to mention that I enjoy British TV!"
3,Single-handed DVD series,"This was ok. It was a little slow moving for my taste but the acting and story lines are good. This is not as good as The Bill, but worth watching. The episodes are just too long for what is needed."
5,Superb throughout !,"I have to admit, I'd never even heard of this program, but ran across it when I was looking for something else. What a superb surprise! The story is extremely well written, the acting is excellent, and the scenery makes me want to move Ireland immediately. If this opening episode is any indication of what's in store, I am truly excited. Absolutely superb throughout! Even though I occasionally had a hard time understanding some of the dialog (I grew up on a farm in Idaho, not the hills of The Emerald Isle), it was not hard to follow the story and to feel the emotions that run the gamut in this very original show. I look forward to watching the rest."
3,Slow at first,"The first episode was very slow in the beginning, but after about 15 minutes the suspense really got going. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because of the audio. When there is music in the background, it gets very loud and it is very hard to understand the dialogue."
1,Waste of money,"I just bought this book to help me plan for my wedding. I was happy to have a tool to help me keep track of my important information. The only problem is that you can't use it! All you get on this CD are sample that don't help you unless you spend another $35.00 to download ""My wedding planner"". I decided that it would be worth it. It turns out the the sample in this book is outdated and can't be used with the new internet software. When I tried to download the new software, my computer crashes. I have tried everything to get this software, but without any luck. I have written the company for help (because they don't respond to phone calls) repeatedly. They have not responded. Don't waste your money on this product. It isn't worth it!"
2,Outdated,"The CD is extremely outdated. Does not run on computer running newer Windows versions - 95, maybe 98. All doc files are read only so they cannot even be saved manually. I'm glad I purchased an inexpensive used copy."
4,Very helpful book!,"Useful book. Unfortunately,didn't get the CD,but have easily been able to make my own excel spreadsheets that I can use to organize my wedding planning and budgeting. Really helpful so far!!!"
4,Amazing Magic,This book I use all the time. There are so many magic tricks through out the whole book. The steps are easy and it teaches you all different magic tricks. If you read this book you will want to put on magic shows for your family. It also reveals many amazing magic tricks that catch your eye. If you like magic this is the book for you!
2,"not great, not bad","i wasn't too thrilled with this book... mainly because .... i didn't find it eye opening.... i felt that it took simple concepts and made it into high concepts and it became repetitive... if this is what ppl have to read to discover that ppl scale situations differently using a combination of their experience and knowledge... ~ save your money, eating a hamburger would be better off....chpt 5 talks about the structure of reflection in action...- evaluatin experiments in problem setting- bringing past experience to bear on a unique situation- rigor in on the spot experiment- virtual worlds-stance in inquiryie. schon's virtual world is to simulate reality... the practitioner constructs and manipulates virtual worlds in order to experiment rigorously (#3 see above)... pg 157... ie. architecture & sketchpad, engineer and models/computer simulation, etc.... we should know this... that's all i mean..."
4,Wicker Rocker,"I am happy owning this rocker. I love the style and look. It has a crack in one of the rocker portions but for the price, it is a minimal problem. I like it enough to bring it intio the house from the porch for the winter. It is in my living room and it looks good there too."
3,"Works fine, but overpriced.",Dewalt make a diamond cup grinding wheels (DW4774 and others) that work as well as this wheel for less than 1/2 the price. Check your local Lowes.
3,Grant and Kerr shine in lackluster comedy.,"This is where Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr first displayed the chemistry that worked so memorably in the later AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER. The plot is silly -Grant dumps workaholic Kerr for simplistic, adoring ""old-fashioned"" wife-type. But before the wedding Kerr starts to educate the meek one. Except for Grant and Kerr it is a mediocre work. Oscar nommed for elaborate oriental costuming and Kerr's constantly changing fashions."
4,One of the better ones,"This is not the type of movie someone who loved ""An Affair to Remember"" would necessarily enjoy, because it is quite different. Still, it is fun to see the interplay between these two very accomplished actors, and the ending, as always, leaves you happy."
3,UUUUUH!!!!!! NOBODY SAID THIS WAS IN BLACK AND WHITE,I PUT THE DVD IN AND ITS IN BLACK-AND-WHITESO I FIGURE ITS DEFECTIVE SINCE AMAZON SAID (Format:color)SO I DRIVE ALL THE WAY TO ANOTHER TOWN JUST TO BUY ANOTHER ONEAND I GET HOME AND ITS BLACK-AND-WHITE ALSOI JUST THOUGHT YOU PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW CUZ THE QUALITY IS HORRIBLEBUT I GOTTA SAY THIS IS A HELL OF A SHOWCOLOR OR NO COLOR IT KIKSBUY IT ANYWAYIN FACT IM GONNA GO WATCH IT AGAIN CUZ I MISSED ALOTCUZ I KEPT THINKIN HOW LAME IT IS TO HAVE A BLACK-AND-WHITE DVD
5,Special and Unique,"Anyone who loves the game of golf knew it had to be true -- golf came from the heavens. This book is an excellent light reading storybook. An endearing tale of the early beginnings of golf on earth. A truly unique gift for the young and young at heart on your list. A beautiful book with awesome graphics and an introduction to Old Mully MacTavish, a character I hope we hear more from. I would recommend this book to anyone."
2,Discombobulated,"If this had contained any Real Science it could have been intersting. Instead, it uses gimmick technology and a mishmash of concepts, all in the name of quantum physics (or something). To add to the confusion, two sets of 3D glasses are included. I hate to be too critical, but don't get your hopes up for any ground-breaking news here on the shroud. It tries too hard, and gets nowhere."
1,Fabric of Time,"Said on front that there is two hours of video, but plays only one hour worth. Not worth the money, and that is false advertising. Very disappointing indeed."
5,teresa's Bang Sessions review,"OH MY GOSH I CAN'T BELIEVE I FOUND THIS ALBUM!!!!!I have never laughed at a song so much as I have laughed at all these, especially ROYALTY CHECK, RINGWORM, BLOWIN YOUR NOSE, NOSE IN YOUR BLOW, DANISH, AND ESPECIALLY ALL 4 OF THE GEORGE SONGS! I am ordering this album RIGHT NOW! VAN MORRISON, YOU ROCK DUDE! What a comedian!!Love to all, Teresa Sanders"
4,A Glimpse For The Intrinsically Nosey,"D.S. White is on to something with her blook (blog book), Age Is Just a Number. With its title and concept originating from her blog, we follow a two-year span of the author's online dating life. A life filled with instant messaging, missed connections and misconceptions. The tone of the blook is witty and engaging; partially satiating human nature's desire to snoop. There is also a resource section provided for those who are not internet savvy. Because it is a serial memoir, not only is the subject matter new and relevant, it has room to grow with technology. I recommend Age Is Just a Number to readers who enjoy memoirs, blogs and light, entertaining reading.Reviewed by Darnetta FrazierAPOOO BookClub"
3,"Long Time BB Fan, but this CD is in the middle","The only reason I bought this CD is to have the song S.O.T.O. This is a superbly written song and one of my favorites of all time..I used to have FOAD on tape, but wore it out playing this song.I am long time guitarist in Punk\thrash style and heard most of these songs back in the late 80's. ""Kick Down the Doors"" and ""Programme Control"" are also very good heavy songs with cool riffs. Some of the first few tracks are of poor recording quality to begin with."
2,Great Product - Terrible taste,"I have heard so many great things about this product and I spent $90. on a bottle, very optimistic about results for my Bernese - they not only spit it out, but run from anything that remotely tastes or smells like it. Tried to mix it in their food crushed finely with favorite menu, and one of my dogs wouldn't approach his food bowl for 2 days afterwards. Help!I really would like to give this product to my dogs, as one of them has very sensitive joints!!!"
4,stopped using the rx pain pills,"Nutramax Dasuquin with MSM for Large Dogs - 150 TabletsOur vet prescribed this product for our 12 yr. old St.Bernard/Golden Retriever, along with a prescription medication for the discomfort of arthritis. After two months use, we were able to discontinue the prescription. Our dog's legs seem stronger and he plays more with our Mini-Schnauzer than he did before taking this supplement. He's had no adverse effects from the Dasuquin, and for him, that's unusual since he has a sensitive stomach. It would be nice if it were a little less expensive, but if you purchase it from Amazon, you'll get your best price. I would definitely recommend this product."
3,Great Price!,My dog has been taking these for a month now & I'm not really seeing too much of a difference yet. He is going to be 12 years this month & I'm thinking they may have helped more if I had started giving them a couple years ago as preventative. I am going to order another bottle & give it one more month. You can't beat this price...my vet wanted double this & another site I just went to wanted even more than them!!!
5,Easy Purchase,"Product as listed in perfect condition, received in timely fashion as promised. I would make this purchase again and would recommend to friends. Much cheaper than my vet."
5,Happy older dog,Our 13 1/2 year old bichon/shi tzu has severe arthritis in his rear legs and can't make it up steps or onto the furniture anymore but at least with Dasaquin he doesn't seem to be in pain and will chase a squirrel again.
5,Dog gone good,"This has been a great find for my Rottweilers. They are 7.5 years old. One has a chronic flare up of elbow and the dasaquin has worked wonders on it. I give him 2 am. and 1 pm. The asymptomatic dog I give 1 per day. Good price, too."
5,Helped my lab.,"My vet sells these for 75 for 80 tablets! Same bottle online but 150 tablets for less money. Since i have a lab they usually have hip and knee problems, but ever since i have giving him dasuquin he hasnt had any problems. Btw, my lab is 95 pounds and he is huge i would seriously recommended this for joint problems in any dog."
5,Wonderful for older dogs,"The average life span for a Bouvier is between 10 and 12 years. Our grand lady made it to 15. I am convinced that Dasuquin with MSM played major role in keeping her mobile.We first gave it to her when she was 12. She was moving with great difficulty at the time. For the first 4 weeks we didn't see any change. Then she gradually became more mobile, began to bounce and play a little, and, began to demand her daily walks again. After about a year we forgot the role it played and stopped giving it to her. Within a week we could see the deterioration, and she stopped asking to go on her walks. We resumed the Dasuquin and in two weeks she was back where she had been.We believe in it so much that we are giving a low dose to our 4 year old Bouvier as a preventative since she has a slight hip dysplasia."
5,Does wonders for my black lab,My lab started having hip and leg problems before she was a year old. A friend who is a vet said the best thing to try and relieve her pain was Dasaquin with MSM. We tried it and it has improved her way of life 99%. She is 3 now and can do everything with virtually no pain.
3,Bang for the buck,"We love our animals, and we want the best for them, so it's a bit difficult to write a review about multivitamins, supplements, herbs, etc.. Most of you have already searched the internet for the pros and cons, and benefits and shams, of these products. My attitude is to provide synthetic and 'green' vitamins, minerals, etc. to our dog--in moderation--and as long as they don't cost $$$. In terms of benefits of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, current research shows that it's not harmful, but nothing conclusive in re. benefits. (Research into benefits of these products, particularly for our beloved pets, is scant at best.) Keeping that in mind, based on the ingredient/amount per cost, this product seems to be the best bang for the buck.As a side note, while our dog will happily chew/gulp down this pill, I've gotten to crushing any pills that I provide him--and this is one tablet that doesn't crush easily (the easiest is Joint Care 2 by Dr. Foster & Smith)."
4,Appears to be a good product.,"Like all supplements, you wonder how much it is actually helping. My 10 year old 85lb Golden Retriever had elbow surgery when he was 1 year old and has had a slight limp ever since. He was on Cosequin for about 4 months back then and it was expensive and I wasn't sure about the benefits so I took him off of it. Now that he is 10, I decided to try Dasequin and he has been on it for about 5 months. He has had more energy and acts more like a puppy now, but I'm not entirely certain that it's all Dasequin. I have tried both the hard and soft chews and my dog will eat either without hesitation so I will stick to the hard ones.Your mileage may vary, but this seems to be a good product from a good company."
5,Extremely Happy!,I was so happy to find this product for this price! I will definately be a returning customer!
5,It works!!,Our two aging Labrador Retrievers have arthritis and joint problems. Dasuquin with MSM was recommended by our vet. It definitely has helped them !!!! I would recommend it to any pet owner.
4,dog and arthritis,Vet had recommended this product and only wish it was beef flavored. They say it is tasty but I know a dog is not writing it. I know it is stronger than Cosequin and for hip problems it has helped my lab get around so much easier.
5,Doggone Great!,"I was introduced to this product by my dog's Vet. He said it would do the trick with his joint pain as he is an older pooch. He was correct, but it was very expensive. I went on Amazon and was able to get double the amount for less than half the money I paid to the Vet. It is the same product! Thank you Amazon!! My doggie's joints thank you too!!"
5,Great Product for Older Dogs,I've been using this product for years based on the recommendation from my vet. My collie/shephard is almost 10 years old and is very slow in getting up in the morning. We break up one pill and put it in her dinner and she seems to do better when she has it then when she doesn't. I'd prefer to give her a preventative supplement than medication.
5,Do it for your dog!,"Its crazy to think it but honestly this is everything that everyone else said.MIRACLE!My dog (150lb mastiff) tore her cruciate ligament in her knee, she got surgery still was limping and staying off it. The vet said she might have to have the other knee done as well because of the extra strain it has endured leading up to the surgery. I started her on 2 a day, for 12 weeks. Now she is running again JUMPING! She is right back to her old self. I'm keeping her on it for life. I'm back to 1 a day so after the initial process its only $200 a year, not bad.Really though best working product for dogs Ive seen. Not even changing from bad food to good food have i seen such an improvement."
5,Noticeable difference,Dasuquin was recommended by my vet. Amazon had the best price. This product is great. My dog is 10 years old and weighs about 100 lbs. She had trouble getting up. She is much better after taking Dasuquin. I strongly recommend it if your dog is getting old and slowing down.
5,Works well for large dogs,Ordered this medication for my dogs on recommendation of my vet. Works very well for my Great Pyrennes who because of size and age is beginning to have joint problems. I would recommend this product to anyone who has a dog who is beginning to show signs of leg issues.
5,Dauquin with MSM for dogs over 60 lbs,"This product was all I was hoping for. Vet recommended, but much less expensive on Amazon. It stopped the clicking in my dogs hips. I don't hear any clicking anymore, and she runs around like a champ. She eats them with no problem after getting used to the smell."
5,Excellent Results!,"This product was recommended by my orthopedic vet following shoulder surgery. It has demonstrated the best joint support I have seen in 10 years of giving joint supplements to my hunting dogs. All my dogs, young or old, now get this daily. It's worth the expense!"
5,Pleased Dog Owner,"Dasuquin is the next generation for Cosequin. We have been pleased with the ongoing result. The dosage is 1 or 2 pills a day, less than the previous medication. So far our 15 year old collie is somewhat stiff but moving much better than one would expect for a dog that age. We are also using it in hopes of slowing the problems of hip displysia in another dog. This is a long term, no black and white result med, but it does seem to work."
5,Dasuquin for Dogs,"Very good product, helps our 9 year old Golden Retriever. Before taking Dasuquin he had aches, pains and slowly got up from a prone position.After taking Dasuquin for several weeks he began to do things like he was several years younger with no aches or pains. For whatever reason he is more lively and runs more than before taking the Dasuquin. Do your dog a favor and try it, it works."
5,Petey,"Our large elderly retriever mix has been on this product for two years, and it helps tremendously with joint stiffness. Within a couple of weeks of starting it, we noticed a great improvement in his movement. When more is needed, I always do a cost comparison and Amazon has had the best price."
5,AMAZING,"My Lab was on pain pills and getting ready to have surgery for hip displeasure until we put her on Dasuquin with MSN. After a month she was back to normal.She has been on it for about 6months now and is doing great.If you have a dog with Joint issues, not giving them Dasuquin is almost cruel."
1,MSM v.s. plain Dasuquin,"First we tried the PLAIN Dasuquin with our dog and he loved it. We played a game and hide one somewhere in the house. Then we'd send him to go find it. He loved the game, the taste and ate it right up. BUT THEN, we tried the Dasuquin WITH MSM and besides being considerably larger than the regular Dasuquin, our dog hated the taste and wouldn't eat it. We had to crush it up in his food and even then he was hesitant. If you have a picky eater, I would recommend trying the plain Dasuquin. I believe it has improved his stiffness in his hips and both kinds of Dasuquin are overall good products, if your dog will eat it."
2,Works wonders but drastic price increase,"I have been giving this pill to my 11 year old lab for a year now. It is amazing the results. She is able to run, fetch, and jump into a SUV with no problems. UNFORTUNATELY, the price went from $56.97 in December 2011 to $98.95 in April 2012. Why? WHY?! Unless Amazon comes down in their price, I will buy this from tscpts.com or allivet.com."
3,Does This Work? Don't Know,"My dog all of a sudden couldn't go up the stairs a while back (she was 4-1/2)and was in pain. After going to the vet and getting x-rays and being told she had arthritis/hip displasia I bought the Dasuquin from the vet even though it was $100, which I thought was outrageous, just so I could get her started on something.I followed the directions but as usual for people or animals they start you out with too much and she had diarrhea. Instead of starting off with too much and then leveling off I then gave her a little and progressed UP. No more diarrhea but I can't really tell if this works. I had her on aspirin before I got to the vet (I had to wait a day or so) and she was normal by the time we got there and hasn't had a problem since. Is it the Dasuquin? Don't know.I'm trying to find something similar on the Internet but the ingredient proportions for the people's version don't correspond to the dog version and I don't know if that's important or not."
5,Dasuquin Results,Dasuquin restored my 15 year old Lab-Husky to a runner from being a reluctant walker. He likes the taste of it.
5,Dasuquin w/ MSM does the job!,"We have a three year-old Lab rescue. He came to our home at 10 weeks old. My daughter was entering her 4th year of Vet School at Texas A&M and while jogging at Lake Bryan she discovered a puppy trying his very best to keep up. He finally pooped out, but had succeeded in capturing her heart. A call to Dad rapidly put Albus (Black and quite fun loving and intelligent) in our care. Later diagnosed with hip dysplasia, the Orthopedic Surgeon at A&M (my Daughters friend and Professor) suggested this treatment - activity and Dasuquin. He has been active, and takes one tablet daily. He will always have the disease, but this drug/supplement has been successful in reducing its affect (positive data supports its impact for animals). Albus is a ""poster child"" for this Nutrmax product. My hat is off to them!"
5,The Sermon on the Mount: The Key to Success in Life,The Sermon on the Mount: The Key to Success in LifeThis book was used by Bill W and the early AA members as a base for forming the AA movement.My Local group studies from it each Sunday morning. It takes about 3 months to complete then we start over at page 1 again.The writing is a metaphysical view of Matthew 5 & 6 & 7 and how it deals with life. The final chapters are an in depth break down of the Lord's Prayer and what it means to our spiritual renewal of life.
5,If you could only have one book,"I can't count the number of times I have read this book over the last twenty years. And I have given copies of it to a great number of people over the years. I'm buying another copy today for a friend, and one to replace the one I gave away recently. It is truly an instruction manual for a successful spirital (and material) life. If I could have only one book to read it would be this one. And I read a lot."
5,Best book for authentic living ever,"I have read dozens, if not hundreds of spiritual living books / books about the Bible, and this is the best I have ever encountered. Fox just lays it out in simple and direct terms about God, our thoughts/actions, and living in harmony with life. My book is so underlined and dog-eared that I may have to order another!"
5,Second Book you need #2.,"This is one of the four books of this title I bought at my husband's request. Once he read it, he felt each of our young adult children should have their own copy. Next to the Bible, he felt this is the second best book to have."
5,Excellent!,"I highly recommend this outstanding classic book. It ties the metaphysical systems with Biblical beliefs in a way that no other publication has. Written during the same time frame as ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill, these two masters convey the same message in different frames, and balance each other perfectly. Very enjoyable and excellent read...I'm on my second read already (within 30 days of receiving the book). -Alan Kosinski [...]"
1,Don't be deceived,"A good title and a catchy - if misleading - cover make this an intriguing book for Christians. I didn't realize when I bought the book that its author was the champion of Christian Science. But about 25 pages into it I began noticing and understanding that the author was acutally advancing his own plan for salvation based on the life of Jesus Christ. I pity him: his lack of ""child-like"" faith in Jesus; the exclusion of grace in his philosophizing; and the need to invent a theory in which it is possible for one to save oneself. This is a misconstruing of the Bible, along the lines of Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, New Age, etc. No question - THIS IS NOT THE GOSPEL OF JESUS. The book is in my garbage can."
1,Emmit Fox a man confused on what he believes,"This book is filled with serious errors. He intellectualizes the simple message of the Good News that Christ brings. Mr. Emmit's hunger for knowledge is reflected by the vast studies in philosophy, the sciences and metaphysics which he mixes with wrong interpretation of the Scriptures. He says; ""Mankind is slow to realize that there is simple no way of salvation except by changing one's consciousness."" Pg 135 This book is very troubling. To think that this man spoke at Carnegie Hall and wrote other books influencing the lives of others with such propaganda is astounding. The whole study of the Sermon on the Mount was intended to teach believers how as a christian we are to live. It is the love of Christ we are to share with others through His gift of the Holy Spirit that dwells within the believer."
3,Way too complex,"While I have always liked this Author, which is why I chose the study, I found this much too ""wordy."" Perhaps I misunderstood the purpose of it. I thought it was a ""question and answer"" type of study. While the content is informative and well written, it is not meant for a busy Pastor who needs a quick study.Having said that, I have enjoyed reading it and may use it in the future as the basis of a Sermon.Rev. Adelle Barr"
3,Sermon on the Mount,Great for any beginner that may have problems with 'religion.' It gets rid of all the malarchy and tells it straight up. Builds a lot of character if your willing to take it's advice
5,the sermon on the mount,"Some where in this book you will read something, that will change your life."
4,Daylight and fresh air to a man trapped in a coal mine,"""Study and believe only those teachings that speak directly to your soul."" These words are daylight and fresh air to a man trapped in a coal mine. Emmet Fox helped me to break free of the confusion and craziness peddled by established religion. I was free to realize a more intuitive understanding of God and of life. SERMON ON THE MOUNT gave me courage to set out on my own spiritual journey and to leave behind years of baggage from catholic school and church TV."
5,Inspired,"This Sermon by Jesus is what the Christian aspires to be through the help of the Holy Spirit. This book helped me to accept that I can have God's help and gifts, even now while still on earth, and take Jesus' teaching more to heart."
3,As usual-- a good book for a good price!,"Not much to say, needed this book for a book study, Amazon had it, I got it, end of story. Happy to have Amazon in my life!"
3,The Book Doesn't Live Up To Its Own Pretensions,"There's some good advice in here. The author suggests that readers continually mine the Bible for new and better treasures--which can never be a bad thing. But some of his observations reminded me much of those loathe Scribes and Pharisees. The author basically says that people who suffer do so through some fault of their own. This may be partially true some of the time. But I would not want to be so arrogant as to tell people with a debilitating disease that they have somehow asked for it, or deserve it, as the religious foes of Jesus' day decided was the case. This is not necessarily a bad book, so long as the reader reads with caution, and a willingness to disagree with the author where appropriate."
5,Amazing!! Nothing less than amazing,"I am so inspired after reading this! It has me grasping a better understanding not only of Jesus' teachings, but for the clear and precise~ in an easy to understand way ~ explanation of the ""Lords Prayer"".It truly has opened my eyes to the world of true spirituality, the way life is to be lead."
2,Poorly Made in China replacement!,Now made in China and design changed from formerly USA made to make a poor fit. Item is now uncomfortable to wear with smaller pouch and even wider waist band over former USA made item.
2,Men's Athletic Supporter,"I would not recommend ths product to larger athletes. They offer very limited support, the product fit is not good and the fabric is uncomfortale."
1,Just doesn't fit,"I have been searching for a replacement to a Champion athletic supporter/brief and came upon this product. I liked the look of it and that it had a full backside. The problem that I have with most athletic supporters is that the pouches are just too small and don't keep things lifted and in place. Most of them just smash the goods. This item was no exception. I purchased the medium (I have a 32-33 waist). When it came, the supporter pouch was VERY small. I contacted the seller about it and they allowed an exchange for a size large, stating that the large had a bigger pouch. Well, I got it and it wasn't much bigger. I think that they really skimped on the material in that area. The key is to have a pouch that cups. The design of this pouch did not. Cannot recommend."
4,Great Product ..... works well when battery is in it...,"I love this product. I moved to a new home where the neighborhood cats love to come into my home... needless to say, my cat doesn't appreciate their friendliness.We bought this door and it worked like a champ. However, it stopped working and we just need to replace the battery.. easy you would think. We have been to a ton of stores and searched the internet with no luck -- where does someone buy replacement batteries for this thing!?If you know, please send me an email... I would recommend you purchasing this item if and only if you are able to find the batteries.. otherwise, you will end up with a very expenses regular cat/dog door.My two cents. Good luck!!"
4,Used for feeding stations - works great!,We purchased 5 of these 6 months ago for our 5 cats that have 5 special diets. We mounted them on wire sided dog crates with the food in the back to prevent the door for staying unlocked as the pet ate and from searching paws from stealing food. They work great! Now we can go away and leave the automatic feeding bowls to feed meals and not worry that one is eating another's special food. Only problem our fat cat is smart and realized it only takes the cat with the right collar (3 collars available) being near the door to open that door and he gets in to eat thei food. The others though know their food is only in their own crate so don't even try the other doors. So if you try it this way crate train the cat first that dinner is only served in that crate then add the door it works great.
3,collar key problems,"The product is great when it works. I have had one of these doors for 2-3 years. I have three indoor-outdoor cats. I had a problem with a neighbor cat coming in and spraying all over my house. The door solved the problem. However, I have had a lot of problems keeping the collar keys working. I have had to replace them numerous times. I am spending $100 / year / cat to keep these keys going. I am not sure what happens to them that they don't work any more. I have replace batteries to no avail. I think the little circuit board gets wet and fries. The unexpected failure of the keys has caused one or more of my cats to get locked out of my house for days. I travel on business and need this system to work when I am away."
4,Time to revisit Networking,"Family Networks by Ross Speck and Carolyn Attneave was far ahead of its time. The many insights gained from their work with networks have many contemporary applications. They understood social networks and developed the language to make sense of them long before the internet came into vogue. As behavioral scientists, they identified many dynamics regarding networking that behavioral scientists of today are just now beginning to wake up and notice. Speck and Attneave saw the need to innovate and the need to stay ahead of many innovations back when they did the research. Had the therapeutic community taken them seriously at that time, they would not have been surprised by the social network phenomena that they are now trying to cope with and come up with ways of dealing with. This is a good volume to begin waking you up to the understanding of networking dynamics.Jeffrey D. MurrahHow to Cope with a Cheating Spouse"
2,slightly disapointed,"I was excited to stumble upon this book as I'm in the process of learning to improvise in western swing, but was disapointed when it arrived. it has some good tips and it covers all genres of swing but over all is just guidlines for what swing music is. some of it I did find helpful (rythym studies, tips, etc.) but it just wasn't what I was looking for."
2,"A scientific analysis, but not for the photos","Well explained, scientifically approached, but if you want some 'good' photos, you better try other books"
1,"Text is OK, but don't get this book for the photos.","As an ""illustrated guide to enhance your love-making,"" the Good Sex Guide is disappointing in its selections of ""illustrations"" - highly air-brushed and artificially posed photos of couples. Quite a turn-off."
1,Look at that foot!,This is no ballerina! What awful technique! That front foot is making me cringe.I wish we could give NO stars.
3,Keyless vs Keyed (jacob's) Chuck,"Having used both keyed and keyless chucks for many years I can tell you from my experience that an old-fashion Jacob's (keyed) chuck is the most secure. The main drawbacks are: a)Time lost changing bits, b)Keeping the chuck key handy. A GOOD quality keyless chuck will do a descent job of gripping the bit and eliminates the need for a key (Makita makes one). 1/4"" hex-shank bits are great for rapid change and will not spin out in any chuck (and eliminate the need for a chuck in a tool (like an impact driver drill) equipped with a quick change collar. The obvious drawback to hex-shank bits is that they will not fit securely in a drill bit sharpener and must be dressed manually (which requires skill, practice and a knowledge of bit dynamics) or replaced (costly & wasteful). I hope potential buyers find this information useful. My 3 star rating is not a reflection on the quality of the product but addresses the convenience enjoyed by using a keyless chuck."
4,Quick Release Chuck for Milwaukee quarter drive impact,Not as steady or true as a regular drill but in a pinch it's nice to not have to carry the drill with you as well.
3,"Not perfect, but better than the Makita version...","Prior to this Milwaukee chuck I owned the Makita key-less version and hated it because it couldn't hold on to a bit. This Milwaukee chuck performs way better and it's much smaller and lighter than the Makita. It is inconvenient that I need to carry the separate chuck key, but I'd prefer that over carrying a pair of pliers (like I did with the Makita chuck) to remove my bit when it got stuck in the wood after the chuck lost its grip. I did deduct two stars because this Milwaukee does have a wobble to it...this may annoy me more over time, but (for now) I feel like it was a good value."
5,Milwaukee Chuck Accessory,This chuck works very well. I use it all the time. Especially when I need to drill very small holes it does the the job fine. I don't even have to use the chuck key most of the time because for my purposes hand tight seems to suffice. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
2,noticeable wobble,"I was very disappointed to see this chuck wobble so much. Granted, drivers with those quick release hex shanks are prone to wobble because of the loose connection, so I tested this check on a drill with a regular chuck and there was less wobble but still noticeable. Apparently, the chuck is not attached completely straight to the shank... quality control should have caught this. I immediately filed a return request, and ordered a Hitachi chuckHitachi 321823 1/4-Inch Hex Drive 3/8-Inch Keyed Chuck Adapter with Key. The Hitachi is larger and heavier (accomodates 3/8"" bits) and does not wobble when tested in my regular drill."
2,Chuck is slightly off center,"This chuck will work well for non precise work, i.e. Quick change for a drill. If you plan on using this for a drill press or any precision work there is a fair amount of wobble in this chuck. I will still use it for quick change odd jobs with my cordless drill but it is useless with my drill press. Because of this I can only give 2 stars."
2,Cars Mack Truck,"My son loves Cars and is collecting each of the Matchbox type cars. He said he wanted a Mac, so I found this one on-line. I was extremly disappointed in the truck, especially for the price. It is cheap plastic and the trailer doesn't not click onto the front of the truck. Therefore, it pops right off all of the time. It would be better if the truck was either one piece or would snap together so as not to fall apart by a slight touch."
2,"Cars Mack Truck -- cheaply made, pulls apart too easily","The trailer and the tractor come apart very easily and it is difficult to put back together for a 2 year old. My son has other tractor trailers that don't come apart nearly as easily as this one. In addition, this version of Mack and Lightning McQueen is cheaply made. It does not have the level of detail that other ""Cars"" toys do, such as the die-cast Matchbox cars. There are better Mack and Lightning McQueen Combo toys out there."
2,What a drag.,"I hooked up my Qosmio to a cable box today and am having several problems 1) When watching live TV I hear the same soundtrack twice, about 2 seconds apart. 2) The picture is grainy and looks nothing like what I saw in the store. 3) There is a line of snow or gray and white static on the top of the screen on every channel. I've spent hours trying to remedy this with no luck. Playing DVDs and listening to music on this machine is simple. Watching TV should be too."
2,Poor TV quality,"If you are looking at this computer for its TV tuner, don't bother. I have a 6 year old (ATI)video card in my old desk top computer that has a much better TV image. There are other problems besides the image:1. The sound doesn't quite synchronize with the image2. Most channels have an annoying bar of flickering pixels at the very top of the screen.3. They tout the instant on feature without booting Windows, but don't tell you that only channels 2-13 are available in that mode.You are better off getting a cheaper laptop and small portable LCD TV than this one computer."
1,STAY AWAY,"I have the exact same problems as the previous reviewer. Mulitple hard drive and system board replacements and unfriendly tech support. The computer is currently being fixed for the 6th time. Toshiba tech support is a joke - they know next to nothing. I once waited on hold for 2 hours and 15 minutes befor finally giving up. If you find youself in the same situation, contact customer relations (if you can get through) and file a complaint - the more the better. I hope to be getting a refurbished laptop as a result. You can sell it on Ebay ($1200) and buy something else - NOT TOSHIBA. NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
2,Outdated,This book would be good if it weren't for the fact that it is out of date. If you are looking to learn MySQL version 5 or higher look for another text.
4,Great little book and to the point.,I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about MySQL. It isnt a book for say advanced admins with plenty of experience but it is good for beginners and those wanting a quick reference book on this topic. I say add it to your library.Marc
4,Non-Anamorphic Letterbox Format spoils Wide-Screen display,This is a good doumentary; but is spoiled by being a non-anamorphic letterbox recording. This means it is displayed in a Windowboxed format with a black border surrounding all 4 sides of the picture on a 16:9 video screen.Minus 1 star for not using a modern recording format on this DVD.
5,A good start to a '51 Ring,"With this release -- which sounds quite good on Urania, I can't vouch for the Myto version -- we have 2/3 of a 1951 Bayreuth Ring available. I hope the magesterial Knappertsbusch GOTTERDAMMERUNG is still available on Testament. That has to be one of Kna's best from Bayreuth. There is a von Karajan SIEGFRIED on Myto, so only WALKURE is missing. A sizeable chunk, but we can always hope one will turn up some day.I can recommend this recording. No reservations on my part."
2,"loud fan, bad USB ports","I've been using my fan for more than a month now. The USB ports went out the first week, but it was overloading my laptop USB port anyway. I think this unit should include a separate power supply to handle the load. I purchased this to remedy a terrible overheating problem with my Dell Latitude. It's doing a super job of keeping my laptop cool, so I've reconciled myself to living with the very noticeable hum coming from under my computer. I would have returned this within the first week if I didn't need the cooling capabilities of this fan so badly."
1,Kooky Book,"What a hoot! Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery. If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense. Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science. There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!"" The author whose real name was Albert Edgerly and who on occasion called himself Dr. Ralston, developed quite a loyal following during his day (1852-1926) among whom was William Danforth, the president of Purina, who even added Ralston to his company's name!"
3,great but,"Alas I'm enjoying the cover for my T989 being that ask the cool covers were designed for the other carriers, but my only complaint us the locking mechanism used. Once you drop the phone it INSTANTLY pops open and your phone either flees out of the case our is left exposed to being flipped on its face. So my workaround was to get some super glue from the hobby store and glue it shut. Figured i could always take a knife to the glue or a key to force it open and reglue it if necessary because sometimes you would brush the clip with your arm and it would pop open. Otherwise its a great piece, clips on to the belt easily. You can remove the clip wheel in the back and slide it in your pocket. Great idea!! Just not enough thought on the closing part."
3,"An ""ok"" title","If you enjoy the Tokyo Extreme Racer series for the PS2 and you happen to have a GBA, then this title is an ""ok"" purchase. It's a very toned-down version of what's on the PS2. The graphics aren't very good either and are very grainy looking."
2,It could have been so much better,"Dwike Mitchell and Willie Ruff are very talented musicians. They obviously love strayhorn's music, and he thought enough of them to write an original four-part suite for them to play.But their performances are disappointing, in that nearly all the music is out of tempo, and there's far too many bravura displays of Mitchell's tremendous technique.Put simply, it doesnt swing. All but the last track, not a Strayhorn tune and put in simply as a filler to pad out the CD, which swings ferociously the whole way..Willie Ruff has a beautiful sound on French Horn, but contents himself mainly with simple theme statements. If Mitchell had played simple, swinging piano (as he undoubtedly can) and Ruff had been a little more adventurous in his solos, it would have been a great album."
3,Weak screws...,"It was easy to install and I like the low profile. It appears to be strong, but my confidence in it got busted when one of the four screws that attach the horizontal plate to the wall simply broke while tightening, leaving about 3/4th of the screw inside the stud. I had to start the installation all over after relocating it on the studs - this time with a set of screws that I bought from Home Depot. I will be keeping an eye on it for several weeks to gain some confidence. I have mounted a 42"", 75lbs TV on it, so it will be a disaster if it comes crashing down. If that happens, I will let everyone here know.Also, the theft-deterrent locking is misleading. It only means that they have a ""special"" penta head screw that will lock the TV in place. I don't really find anything special about the screwdriver. I am sure it would be part of any smart burgler's toolbox."
2,Attacking a Straw Man,"This book does a fine job of dispelling the view the genes solely determine cognitive ability. The problem is that virtually no researchers in the fields of differntial psychology or psychometrics are arguing this position. According to respected experts (e.g., Thomas Bouchard, Arthur Jensen, and Linda Gottfredson), the answer to the question ""nature or nurture?"" is nature and nurture. The available evidence indicates that both play an important role. The authors of this book are therefore attacking a straw man for ideological reasons.The critique of this issue in Hernstein's and Murray's ""The Bell Curve"" is much more valuable for anyone with an open mind. But if you've already been baptized into the cult of egalitarianism, read and enjoy."
1,hocus-pocus,"It is simply incredible that somebody, nowadays, can still defend the absense of the genetic character of the human intelligence! It is impressive how some people confound politics and science. To those people, or you are leftiest or the opposite."
4,Has some good insights but...,"Lewontin, Rose and Kamin argue that people are the way they are because of social conditioning and birth privilege, not because of their biology. Not in Our Genes, and similar books, balance the argument that our actions and motives are governed only by our genes.This book has some useful insights worth exploring. Having said that, as with many other books that argue specific areas have controlling influence on human behavior, this book needs to be read with discretion.The Re-Discovery of Common Sense: A Guide to: The Lost Art of Critical Thinking"
5,A fascinating and thought-provoking classic,"This book was published in 1984. Funnily enough, 24 years later and despite important scientific advances, ""Not in our Genes"" remains as fresh, interesting and fascinating today as it was back then.If you want to develop your critical consciousness, to learn to think for yourself, not to depend on ready-made opinions and to find the other side or even an alternative to the predominant story about evolution, biological determinism and the like, read this book.It is enlightening and already a classic. You won't regret it."
1,Politically Correct BS,"It is amazing how an academic and a scientist can be so politically biased and unscientific. Lewontin would have thrived as a Soviet scientist, especially working with the likes of Lysenko. This is a work of political correctness, wishful thinking and biased opinion under the guise of science."
5,New Face Emerges from Latin Explosion,"Luis Fonsi may be a new name for many people in the US market. But this Puerto Rican singer has been winning over fans with his incredible voice and amazing talent since the release of his 1998 album ""Comenzare"". Not only has he had 3 very successful Spanish albums, but he has also done duets with artists like Olga Tanon, and Christina Aguilera.This album has a mix of romantic ballads, dance and pop songs. With every note he sings, you can just feel the intense emotion and passion he puts into his work. Don't be surprised if one of his songs brings tears to your eyes. He is an incredible talent that is sure to make a huge impression on the English market. You can see his new video ""Secret"" (which was directed by long time friend and *NSYNC member Joey Fatone) on TV or on the web.If you like singers like Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, BSB, *NSYNC you are sure to enjoy Luis Fonsi!Check out his 3 Spanish Albums, they are all very good!..."
4,"Great English release by Luis, but not his best!","Don't get me wrong, I love this Cd, but I was expecting better ballads by this incredible singer. My favorite songs in this cd are: If only and I wish. I still prefer his Spanish CDS Abrazar la Vida and his latest Paso a Paso."
3,Disappointing,This is not at all useful to me as a reference book. I had hoped to learn a lot about what I am finding. I learned very little and rarely find it helpful.
3,Missing Types,"Although several types are mentioned that aren't found in many publications, one common point are missing (at least), Rockwall,"
3,A word of warning,"This book is just a slapdash reprinting of Japanese book. The images in half the puzzles are of Japanese characters and references that most Americans would be unfamiliar with. Also, there are no special puzzles, such as the ones where you'd use two different colors of ink, for example."
3,Good but not great.,"I bought this book from the advertisement in Games magazine (the best). I am a huge fan of paint by numbers. I've completed every single one Games magazine has ever published (and most of World of Puzzles) for the last 2 decades. I was disapointed for 3 reasons: 1) the squares are too big. This takes way too much lead. This may also have something to do with the paper. 2) Most pictures are un-interesting. They are choppy (also due to the big squares), and many are symbols from Japan and are unfamiliar to an American. 3) Several are impossible to decipher after they're solved; I had to look up the solution just for the title to tell what the heck I was looking at. The bigger ones are much better, but you have to go through 85 of them before you get to them."
4,Nonograms for all skill levels,"For some time this was the only stand-alone ""picross/paint-by-numbers/nonogram/griddler"" type puzzle book of it's kind released in the USA, and to date, it's still the best U.S. published offering for puzzles of this type. The book starts out relatively simple, which is great if you are new to these types of puzzle. As you progress through the book the puzzles become a tad more complicated, but never anything overly-impossible (like some japanese published puzzles magazines that have fold-out puzzles with grids that are 100x100!!!!!).I purchased this book awhile ago & it took me about 3 weeks to complete all the puzzles- I don't know if that's good or bad- As I've been hunting down and doing these puzzles anywhere I can find them for the past 7 years; thankfully, with the progresion of time and the gaining popularity of this puzzle-type it's infinitely easier to locate magazines and books of this kind.Oh, and the completed puzzles are really nice- good selection here."
4,Great for Beginners,I just recently became interested in Paint by Numbers puzzles and one of my professors recommended Games Magazine. This book is helpful because it explains how to solve a Paint by Numbers puzzles. You can start off with simple puzzles and work your way up to harder puzzles in the book. The only complaint I have is that it would be easier to work on the puzzles if it were spiral-bound.
4,I do these all the time and they are a lot of fun,"I love this book. I first discovered these games with the Battleship version in GAMES Magazine. Then I visited Japan in 1997 and came back with a magazine dedicated to what they called ""Logic Paradise"", when I realized how much fun it could be if they were actually pictures. Then I came back to the US and was disappointed that I couldn't find more!Anyway I found this book at a game specialty shop in Brookline, MA, and I love it. The puzzles get as big as about 25 x 25 or 30 x 30, which is good although I wish I could find more like the Japanese ones that go up to at least 100 x 100.Anyway the paper is fairly good in this book and the puzzles are all high-quality. Enjoy!"
3,Logic Picture Puzzles,"This logic puzzle book is a good value and difficult to find in most book stores. I would recommend it for a beginner in logic puzzles, but most of the puzzles are not challenging enough for a puzzle wiz. The best deal overall is to purchase the weekly packages through the Conceptis website."
4,Cool Approach to History,"This book is perfect for history lovers who commute -- it includes great writing, terrific detail, and a ""mystery"" worth exploring from beginning to end. I enjoyed how the author used deductive reasoning to get to his conclusions and the backstory he explained throughout."
3,"Interesting plot, but too slow.","Though the premise behind this book was fascinating, I sometimes felt more like I was reading a scholarly journal article than a novel. Often, the storyline gets mired down with details of exactly which library had which copy of the book, even when the particular copy is unremarkable. The order of events is often spotty; chronologically, Gingerich would have been able to exact more drama and excitement--I would have liked to have the story unfold for me in the same way it did for the author.I did enjoy the anecdotes about copies which were exceptional in some way, and loved learning more about how rare books are auctioned, stolen, doctored, and sometimes hoarded by governments or libraries. The exploration of Copernicus' theories themselves was intriguing.All in all, an interesting read, if you're willing to slog through all the superfluous detail. Three stars."
1,Ensure mind is engaged before keyboard is in gear ...,"""Gee gosh golly"" anecdotal intelectual flabbyness, mostly centering on ""I,"" and written in flacid prose. Would award no star at all if that were possible.For coverage of similar and related material would highly recomend J. L. Heilbron's ""The Sun In The Church"" -- a vigorous and active intelect conveying complex insights clearly and writing with a dry sense of humor."
3,Fire in My Bones: Transcendence and the Holy Spirit in African American Gospel (Contemporary Ethnography),I have only started reading this book. But from what I have read it seems to be a good book. But I have one problem with it and that is the author of this book is writing from a white mans view of this experiences.
2,Gun Aramaic Pt..2,"Any muslimgauze album will blow most bands out of the water, but compared to other gauze releases, Gun Aramaic pt 2 doesn't size up as his best. Its not bad and even worthy of purchase. But NOT as an introduction to gauze. The distinguishing element of this album is a very loud live drum that exacerbates a sort of ROCK style. However, I believe Bryan Jones made the drum work, and work nicely. Expect some recycled sounds; there are snippets of music from ""Betrayal"". I would say, if you see it used or cheep, go for it, otherwise there's about 60 better muslimgauze albums to choose from. (Good luck finding them all.)"
4,Cute toy.,My 18 month old daughter enjoys this toy a lot. She is good with small pieces and does not eat them. She enjoys popping the pile of pieces onto the board and also seeing if they stick to my clothes or her pants.The carrying package is nice to have but the envelope that they made to hold the pieces is hard for me to get into (nevermind my daughter).The background is a little crowded with stuff so it is hard to find logical places to put all the pieces at once. But once she is old enough to make scenes that should be ok.
5,SSA7 SuperSprings on a 2004 Tacoma,I bought these springs for my 2wd Tacoma because I was carrying a 300 lb slide-in utility shell as a camper. I already had an add a leaf to bolster the notoriously weak Tacoma springs. I got all of my height back and it rides fine with a load in it. I had them on in about 2 hours of going slow with basic hand tools. Well worth the money vs airbags. Liked them so much I'm getting another set for a newer 2008 Tacoma I just bought. Would reuse these but they don't work on the 2008.
3,Great recepes but watch out for salt!,"I loved California Pizza Kitchen restaurant when I lived in LA, and the book finally answered my question about barbeque chicken salad: ""How they do it?"" The salads and soups are great, despite million ingredients. What is bad in this book is salt. I don't know who wrote it but salt in each recepe more than twice as much as it should be. Put as recommended-and you want be able to touch it. This is very inconvenient, since I want to trust the recepes in a book that I buy. Another minus to the cook book-all dishes take a lot of time to prepare, so unless you are crazy about the taste (like I am about that Barbeque chicken salad), you might not appreciate the time spent."
5,Yummy for my tummy....Just as good as restaurant :-),"Though some of the recipes can be time consuming (bbq chicken salad...lots of chopping), they are absolutely delicious. To CPK's credit, they definately make you appreciate what you pay for. I use this book more than the pizza one. My favorite recipes are the BBQ chicken salad, Ceaser salad, the foccacia bread, the rosemary chicken sandwich, etc. Basically I cook the recipes I like to order and it tastes just like the restuarant, so make what you like to order :-).An added bonus is that by cooking it myself, I can incorporate lower fat options and adjust the recipe to save on calories.Happy cooking!"
3,Okay Cookbook,I am a pretty good cook and an avid CPK customer. I did not feel the food tasted as good as from the restaurant. I know that restaurants have better stoves and ovens but I just did not enjoy the items I made. Not a bad cookbook as it does make you want to go to CPK to eat.
5,My Favorite California Pizza Salads,Great recipes... especially my favorite salad that I usually buy when in their restaurants... now I can fix it at home.
1,California Pizza Chicken Recipe a Disappointment,I bought this book for only for the jambalya recipe. It tasted NOTHING like the dish at the restaurant. I haven't tried any of the other recipes.
2,Ouch! For Geniuses Only,"Too hard - is sitting in my bookcase, all by its lonesome. I am intrigued by this and many other puzzle books that ask a lot of stuff that is challenging, but isn't even in a crossword dictionary. Steer clear of this if you like easy to medium puzzles. I cannot respond to crossword questions asking the fifteenth letter of the Egyptian alphabet, or an easy use for rennet in five letters or less. Guess I am too dumb..."
3,Fatally flawed.,"Conceding at the outset that there might be some truth to the author's testimony, the first question that came to mind as I began reading the book was: How can the U.S. Government allow publication of this book without prosecuting for breach of security? As I progressed through the book I began to understand why. Whether or not there are Government activities involving aliens, this book unwittingly strains more than any other recent publication to dispel the notion that there are!An early clue is the description of a third party introduction at the top secret level between the author and one of his commanders. Anyone familiar with the process will recognize that it is fatally flawed.After years of intuitive contacts the author would be expected to relay to the reader much that was substantive that had been derived through these contacts. There was nothing of the sort. Try enjoying some other novel."
1,Above black,"Too vague, but probably true. I,m retired police and I believe the story is true. I recommend it. Stranger things have happened."
4,Above Black: Project Preserve Destiny Insider Account of AlienContact & Government cover-Up,This book is a very easy read and insightful. Kudos to Mr. Sherman for being brave enough to tell the truth.
2,I expected much more out of this book...,"Oh well, I thought I was getting a different story and I did but not enough, it was a very small book, and it is a "" UFO teaser "" it does not meet my criteria of a real story, this guy talks a bit about his experience, but is a typical denial where he does not come out with a reality, a tangible proof, or a witness...and then the tale is over...like he wants to make some money with a continuation and is not fair, the book is $12.00 dollars not $2.99...!!!"
4,stop hiding,"good book. This book answers many questions about abductions, government and grey secrecy and why the average person is so oblivious to it all. I got the feeling that these greys are NOT so impressive afterall. How does communication with greys preserve our destiny? What could be better than a global farm where all the livestock look after themselves?"
2,You've Got To Be Kidding Me!,"The writing is poor and the editing is a once over with a word processor spell checker. I cannot believe anything this author is saying. I do believe in the UFO cover-up, but I think this is made up and a rehash of other books in this genre. Try Dr. Paul Hills 'Unconventional Flying Objects' or the best selling author Jim Marr's 'Alien Agenda' or even Steiger's 'Rainbow Conspiracy' before bying this 'Tale'."
2,Shallow,"This book left me wondering how Dan Sherman actually communicated with the two aliens. Did he rely solely on his computer or was his ""intuitive communications"" ability involved? How did he use his ""intuitive communications"" ability in communicating with the aliens?And by what I read in other UFO/alien books aliens speak in a monotone emotionless tone. Dan Sherman's communications with the two aliens sounded like they had a lot of emotion.Otherwise the book is very exciting, and interesting, but disappointing at the end."
2,"Good idea for a fictional short story, but not a book.","A very easy read which takes about two hours. It contains no concrete evidence that the ""truths"" may exist in reality. The reader can believe it or not. The chapter ""Bones' Revelations"" gives no meaningful insights as to why aliens take the time to interact with humans and does not even temp you with innovative speculations. The only link to something interesting was a brief mention to wave interference and noise, which I was part of a ""real"" classified project in 1970. However, there are no new technical references or ideas in this book. This story would have been better presented as shortened to a 2500 word short story. My review comes from a 25 cent copy purchased from a library withdrawal sale."
1,Not Good,"The cover of the book I received was NOT the same as on the display page! The book could also be called a booklet as it was small and thin. The information in the book was totally unsatisfying. I was Dissapointed!! If I could have given it less that one star, I would have! Don't waste your money!!!"
3,Not too bad,The book is not to bad . But nothing that I wouldnt or havent put pass not only our grovement but all graoving couties.The book did not tell all though as I have read the frist and real Blue book long time ago. The one out now has cut out more than 1/4 of what was said in the frist book.But this book will make you think of all the BS that does go on behide close doors.
4,Very Informative,"I was very glad to buy this book. I have read other books on the pug breed, this by far is one of the best I've read.Since I am first time owner of a pug dog,it helped me have a better understanding of a very comical,loyal and loving pet I am proud to own for 8 years now."
5,Michelle Malone is one of the greatest!,"Of all the CDs I have purchased this year, this one has got to be my favorite. This independent and literally brilliant artist never fails to satisfy with each new release. I could go on continuously about each track on this CD, but all I will really say to people who appreciate REAL musicianship, a wonderful voice, infectious songwriting and a terrific blues-rock sound is BUY IT! This CD will not disappoint and aims to please all the way. Also,just when I thought that the highly recommended CD ""Beneath The Devil Moon"" was Michelle Malone's crowning masterpiece, she releases the marvelous ""Sugarfoot"" nine years later, and in my opinion, the best CD of her career. Thank you ""Moanin' Michelle"" and hope to hear you play at Nietchze's in Buffalo soon!"
5,"If you've never seen her live, start with this album!","Michelle Malone is the most dynamic performer I've ever seen! She has a style all her own, and what a style it is. She is a master musician, and is always pushing for more. This latest effort had me spell-bound from the first track. Several of the tunes compelled me to hit repeat and play them again, but the album flows so invitingly, that I just let the whole thing play....over and over. Get this collection to get an idea of her live performance, then check your local listings...chances are she is playing somewhere near you. Cindy Burke"
5,Great series but where is the last book?,"Loved the characters, the story was great. Top notch but the third book never came out. What happened to this guy? I've read dozens of zombie books over the last few years and this is in my top three. Travis if you're still alive write exodus!"
3,Good Zombie story,"Overall I thought the book was a very good read. The story line flowed well, but some of the characters could have used a little more depth to them, such as some of the black berets. There wasn't much substance to Courtney and Gordon, her trainer, nor Courtney and Leon, the other black beret she was ""involved"" with. I found myself reading it entirely in one sitting, but wished for just a little more. Even so, it is a good book to bring with you on a plane ride and keep you occupied."
1,Boring.....,"This book was brought to my attention on a website that I help manage and being a huge zombie fan I decided to check it out. Man was I disappointed. I was hoping for some action right off the bat but instead I felt like I was reading a crappy teen magazine. I read the first few chapters and decided to put the book down and go read I Am Legend again. Some people told me that it will get better but I have yet to see where it gets better. I love it when an author gets into a character development but sometimes they can go overboard with it. I can care less about her sexual issues and teen angst. I want battles between hordes of flesh eating ghouls and close battles, NOT ""Oh I screwed you once and blah blah blah."" Needless to say, if you into the zombie genre then read Down the Road or Day by Day. Those are classics in the making."
4,Great coming of age tale,It is a perfect book for newbies to Zombie genre and great read for adolescents. I enjoyed the book and wished it was a tad bit longer or had a more definite ending.
4,Unusual Perspective,"The plot was ""different"" with a cure at hand and it had lots of twists and turns in between. One reviewer asked if this book was written for teenagers but it can be enjoyed by all ages. One thing for certain is whoever is reading it definitely ""views"" the world through someone else's eyes. It made the book interesting because it is essentially a man writing from a 17 year old girl's perspective and how she acted like a spoiled brat before the ""end"" and how quickly she had to grow up when the end came. It was a a good book and I read it in an afternoon."
3,Was This Book Written For Teenaged Girls?,"Adkins book reads less like a horror story than it does a tale of a young woman maturing to acknowledge the world as it exists and learning to deal with it.Horror factor is minimal. To be quite honest, except the last few chapters (which are somewhat silly and far-fetched, even for a zombie novel) the walking dead are in the background, treated as props and scenery for the story.Definitely not recommended to anyone looking for a good zombie read."
4,Heart of Bone,"It doesn't have as much action as most of the Bone series, but Rock Jaw: Master of the Eastern Border is what Jeff Smith refers to as the philisophical heart of Bone. It follows Fone and Smiley Bone as they try to return Rat Creature Cub Bartleby to his people. They are captured by Mountain Lion Roque Ja, and we get an even greater insight into the world of Bone."
5,"Jeff Smith's Great work, and Art","I consider Jeff Smith one of the finest Artists ever!his art and illusion make you drift away onto the quest of bone himself! it is a overstanding comic book of adventure, mistery, and love as well. I am looking formward for the next book to come up!!!"
4,nice.,"Really enjoyed this, plenty of interviews and freestyles, funny too.It wasnt too long, was well edited and although I fell that it neglected the underground scene a bit, was still a great round up."
5,fly doc,Loved every minute! Looking forward to watching it 20 more times. If you love hip hop music you have to own this movie.
1,Boring....slow,This movie was extremely slow and boring. I don't recommend. 10 more words are required so I need to add these words.
2,Boring.,"I love old rap, however the pacing of this documentary is very slow and boring. Couldn't make it past the 30 minute mark."
5,Excellent Documentary,"Love the fact that he goes over ""old school"" hip hop which is real hip hop not the garbage that they have out nowhe covers west coast hip hop and east coast hip hop which i thought was great, saw some of my favorite rappers like big daddy kane and wu-tang clanworth the rent if you like old school hip hop, when it had substance not the so called hip hop that is out now which is horrible"
4,Great effort,"Because this also acts as a who's who of Hip Hop, it's hard get all of the legends but there were quite a few people missing and a few that didn't deserve as much time as they got but overall it was pretty good."
5,Great read!,"I was riveted from the beginning till the end of the book. It's a pity that Sheila had to learn the lesson about men the hard way when her newly-married husband turned out to be a jerk.I like Laredo, the American outlaw who joined the Mexican bandits. His whimsies about home, about eating cherry-topped sundae was really touching. You can actually feel his emotion, how much he missed home, and yet unable to return because he was a wanted man. I like Rafaga too, the outlaw leader, who was a very charismatic man. His mistress committed a crime which amounted to punishment, and despite his heavy heart and sadness, he continued on with the punishment.Sheila, the Texan heiress, was rather petulant, for me. But I admire her survival spirit and courage. Not many would be like that in her position.The ending, like all the Janet Dailey books I read so far was rather abrupt and left to the reader to contemplate further what happened next.A great read."
2,disappointing,"As I have read Janet Dailey in the past I looked forward to reading this book. The book was good up to the demanding and whipping of Sheila by Rafaga. For someone who has seen the abuse of a person, I found this part of the book very degrading. I did not finish the book, in fact I threw it away. It will be some time before I read another of her booksAnonymous"
5,Touch the Wind,I loved this story. I have read it several times. I had read it in the past and lost my copy of it so reordered it. I would like to see Janet Dailey write another book and let us know what happened to the Rafraga? After all he was wanted by the law. She left it up in the air. However I still loved the story.
4,Handy reference guide for Turner Classic Movies viewers,"This book contains every feature film made by RKO studios from the beginning of the talkie era to 1960, listed alphabetically from ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS to ZOMBIES ON BROADWAY. Information includes cast and credits, synopses and interesting notes about the films. In addition to the films produced by RKO, the book also includes films by independent producers like Walt Disney and Sam Goldwyn who released through RKO. Since most of RKO's own feature films are in the library of Turner Classic Movies, this book makes for a very handy reference source to place by your television for quick reference when an RKO film--whether GUNGA DIN or MEXICAN SPITFIRE'S ELEPHANT--comes on the screen."
3,"Fast service, flimsy book","The seller was very fast and professional in shipping and correspondence. Disappointed in the quality of the book, very brief reviews and all pictures were copies. Would not have purchased this book, if I knew it was a paper copy of a hard bound book."
3,Needs Updating Badly!,"'A Reader's Guide to Science Fiction' was an excellent book when it was first published over 20 years ago. Updating the book would be an excellent (and badly needed) project for Mr. Searles, et al, or some other sf/f lover.The authors do a good job of explaining the strengths (and weaknesses) of each writer as well as covering their major works. Also at the end of each writer's section is included a ""If you like the works of Fred Smith, try these writers...""Many of the writers included in the book are all but forgotten in the year 2002. Also many sf/f talents from the past 20 years are sorely missing, including Nancy Kress, Connie Willis, Karen Joy Fowler, Michael Swanwick, Orson Scott Card, and a multitude of others. If this book were updated, it would fly off the shelves. Anybody listening?"
5,Texas Tornado,"The book is not only a rich history of the fight for women's rights in Texas and the US but a wonderful look into the life of an incredible woman. The story is told with such warmth that you end up loving this tough, spunky, little woman. The book is a must read for every lawyer in the state of Texas while also a wonderful example of a dedicated wife (under often horrid circumstances) and a devoted mother.Louise Raggio is definitely a Texas Tornado."
1,Very Boring,"This book is very boring. This book neither works as a biography nor as legal journalism.Raggio's life story is boring. Louise Raggio had a unremarkable and typical early 20th century life. The only exciting fact is that Grier Raggio her husband was accused of ""unamerican activities"" and was Lee Harvey Oswald's appointed attorney for several hours. Otherwise the stories of Louise Raggio growing up on a farm, going to college, getting her first job are tedious and without literary merit.As legal journalism, it is way too high level. There are no specific legislative stories, no landmark legal battles, no interesting legal cases. If Raggio revolutionized Texas family law it is not documented in this book.I would not recommend this book."
2,Very outdated,"This book is good if you still need to know HTML to create websites. However, if you are using a program such as GoLive or similar, where you don't need to know HTML, this book is ancient. It is interesting to read though, about how sites used to be created. It's from 1997, so it isn't that old, but most of the info inside is irrelevant to those who already know what they are doing."
2,Awkward indeed,"Ty is not a bad MC, but he is definitely from the UK. If you don't know what I mean, you haven't really listened to rap from the two sides of the Atlantic. For some reason MCs from Britain are stuck in a rap time warp. They are still on that audience interaction/punchline stuff, which is great, but not for an entire album. Ty has some narratives but his rapping is still subpar. The tracks are all very easy and they flow, but nothing really ""grabs you"". I wasn't feelin' this album."
4,great collection,"I hope to check out his entire Bottesini series, but for now this is the only one I have. I tend to like the CDs that have rare tracks on them rather than the usual ""greatest hits of Bottesini"" type of thing. This one unearths many unknown or seldom heard works and is worth adding to your collection if you are into that sort of thing. I've heard that he researches many of the pieces' actual manuscripts and plays from them so this is the real deal. I could use a little more intensity and some more bel canto phrasing in some parts, but overall a great CD."
2,played out,"do or die was kickass and righteous, blackout would have been lame if it werent for a couple songs like fields of athenry, but warriors code makes me want to slam my wiener in the toilet seat. the auld triangle is the only good song on there. theyre starting to sound like everyone else. i hate mtv."
5,Blue Collar is Back,"The Murphys new album is amazing. They have been dogged for either having too much celtic music or too much punk in their songs. I personally the skinhead punk more, but this album is a perfect blend of both. All the songs are very feel good and seems like they had a lot of fun making the album. Any Murphys fan who denies this album is in denial."
3,Anthem Punk Rock all of the Way,"This is a good album with a lot of punch. I myself get tired of all of the ""Anthem Punk"". They sound like either you're at a National Front rally, a Football game or listening to a Budweiser commercial i.e. the song ""The Spirits Alive"". I guess this is better than crybaby ""Emo Punk"" if you call that pop trash punk. And for people that say it is a good mixture of Punk and Irish...Most of the songs have nothing to do with traditional Irish Music except maybe playing a banjo at the start which doesn't make it Irish. The structure is still Punk all of the way. If you want more Irish in your Punk Rock check out: Pogues, Flogging Molly, Tossers and/or Blood or Whiskey... Those bands will fill your need for Irish music more than this band."
4,excellent victorian costume source,"delightful book with lots of pictures of victorian style wedding attire. useful for ""dedicated to detail costumers' and for modern brides who want the victorian look for their weddings as well. plenty of detail pictures of shoes, corsets undergarments,headdresses etc. i would definitely recommend this book."
4,A Perfect Vacuum,"Creative and thought-provoking, Lem delves into the realm of the ""unwritten."" Being both playful and serious at the same time, this book is very smart."
2,"great idea, but needs some touching up","Not a bad idea for a novel. Touches on such subjects as ""doppelgangers,"" ""how well do you know yourself/the ones you love,"" and I think that it would have been a little better if there had been a little less description on EVERY little detail in the novel. But it was a good idea, and worth a try."
1,Who Published This Book? It is AWFUL!!!,I follow Michael Upchurch's reviews in the Seattle papers and so I expected that his novel would be well-written and interesting. I could not be more surprised at how amateurish his effort is. I wonder how he found a publisher?
4,for the price it does the job,"decent not great. some are easy to program and some are hard to understand and program. overall, am happy with the product. the thermal papers are too expensive and am glad there is an option to turn the receipt on and off."
2,Disappointed.,"I ordered the Krusell Cabriolet case for my Nokia E61 smartphone. However, the cut-outs do not fit some of the buttons on the phone exactly, as was described in the product description. I have tried several times to adjust the case to accommodate the power button and the joy stick on the phone, but to no avail. I also see that the cut-outs are not completely straight -- which is the cause of the problem."
2,Just did not fit,I have had other Krusell cases an they were great but this one just did not fit the phone very well. I gave it a couple of weeks hoping the leather would strech but it did not help. They still have the best belt clip system.
1,Turns off phone,Poorly designed. No cover for screen and seems to hit power button and turn phone off on a regular basis.
1,Phone will Not stay in case it come out by itself,The Leather is real good but no strap to keep phone in the case I just start using this case last night and it came out by it self five different time not made right.
1,Wrong costume,"ALERT. The costume in the picture is NOT what you get when you order this Creature Reacher. The sleeves don't reach the clown arms at all. Also the mask is so big it constantly collapses, and with your arms in the clown arms you have no hands free to fix it.Be prepared to make alterations both to the costume sleeves and making some sort of frame to go inside the mask.For the work involved this should be an 80$ or less costume."
5,Another perspective on infinitesimals,A bit philosophically heavy at times and initially the loss of the law of the excluded middle is a little disconcerting but one gets used to the new logic quickly enough.
5,This is what I needed. A book on auto sales that works!,"I read this book over a week vacation. I have been in the automotive retail business for 15 years and ocasionally read a sales book or buy an audio tape. Usually, the training I receive is expensive and not more than basic, run of the mill stuff. I have had great experience with Cardone and Verde. Now I can say that Ziegler is right there with them. Very good book. I'm leaving this review because I happened to read through all the reviews. I agree with 14 of the 16 posted. The two negative ones perhaps did not read the book at all. It seems that they were posted by an author of another sales training book. (I say this because they both say the same thing, pitch the same poorly reviewed book, and have a fictitious name.) Make up your own mind."
5,If I had this book when I started selling. . .,"I couldn't find anything to read when I started selling cars 10 years ago. You fall down. You pick yourself up. That was my training. Now, I dont know if any one way to learn is better than the other. I wouldn't want to risk it if I were new. This book spells the sale out clearly."
2,Unimpressive,"I ordered this book after reading several good reviews about it. After reading it, though, I was unimpressed to say the least. I guess I'm not gullible enough to believe the BS and hokey stories that seem to have been exaggerated, embellished, or made up all together. Overall it was a big disappointment."
5,Real life info,"I have read a few of the popular books on automotive sales and this has to be the best. This book is full of great how-to information, in addition it is presented in a comical easy to read format with lots of interesting stories about dealership life. I really connected being a ex-service employee of a dealer myself. I miss those days and want to get back in on the sales end. I can say this book will make not only getting a automotive sales job that much easier, it will help me from day one with all the how to advice.."
3,Expected More,"While the information obtained from reading this book was informative, I thought it was kind of weak compared to the way some previous readers raved about how great it was. Easy to read and sometimes even funny, but I think working as a green pea for 10 days has proved to be more enlightening each time I find out something new that my colleagues/peers or closer failed to tell me has been way more informative than this book. I'd recommend borrowing it. After reading it once, I don't think I'll ever reference the book again. Maybe good for some, but it didn't seem worth it to me. I've got a used one with less than 5 hours on it, if you're ready to buy, come inside and make me an offer. I'm sure I could make you a deal."
