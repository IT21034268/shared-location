5,"A good CD to sing-a-long with, if you keep your windows shut","I have been listening to the CD since the early 70's (on record) when I was about 5 or 6 years old. Not only was it a constant that was played by my mother, but it was always a welcome playmate. The mix of the various artists keeps it exciting. No two songs sound the same, even the songs that are sung twice! If you love Dave Brubeck,Louis Armstong and friends,you will feel like you are right there with them.They sing upbeat selections as wells as a few ballads. Good listening. (And singing, if you do that sort of thing!)"
1,It was like new,It was as described. It played with no problems. I was pleased to find it after looking for along time
1,Worst Kindle Dictionary,This is an horrible dictionary. It can't be set as a kindle default dictionary. You can't look up words by typing them in a search field and you can't go to any specific page in the dictionary. There is no table of contents and the definitions are short and very poor. No sample uses are given and declined nouns or conjugated verb forms just aren't listed. This is a waste of money. Don't buy it!!!! If you have be sure to return it within 7 days or your stuck with it. Very dissatisfied.
2,"If you want Bosnian, do not buy this!","This dictionary isn't too bad; however, beware! There are quite a few words that are translated into Serbo-Croatian and not Bosnian, such as biirth certificate. In Bosnian it is rodni list, but in this book it is krsni list, which to Bosnians is a substantial difference. If you know the Bosnian culture, the book is okay; however, if you're tryng to learn BOSNIAN, do not buy it."
1,Very poor,"If you think you are going to get a quality IBM keyboard for this price, think again. This is a cheap keyboard in IBM black to make you think it's something it's not. I just removed this keyboard from the system I was using it with, because I finally got fed up with retyping the dropped characters. I'd return it if it weren't used. If you are a good typist (I'm a fast touch-typist), do yourself a favor and buy a quality keyboard instead of junk like this."
2,"Want a noisy, awkward keyboard? Thi is it!","I bought this keyboard because of the info I found on Amazon reviews and on several forum boards about how quiet it is. I was specifically looking for a quiet keyboard and was willing to put up with the retro-clunky look of this one to get quiet. Well, surprise. This is probably the most clackity-loud keyboard I've ever used. The noise actually goes well with the retro-clunky look. Regarding that look, this thing is so fat at the backside that it does not slide into my standard keyboard tray without first collapsing the little elevators in back. I always have those up on my keyboards as I find it uncomfortable typing on a flat-to-the desk keyboard. Bottom line: If you like a noisy keyboard hat looks straight out of 1984, go for this one. I'm still looking for a quiet keyboard."
1,Didn't work for me.,"I bought this keyboard and mouse directly from Lenovo with an X61 with Ultrabase and monitor. The mouse worked but the keyboard did not. After 2 replacement keyboards Lenovo agreed, reluctantly, to allow a return with refund. There are no instructions with the hardware describing how to set up the keyboard. The detailed instructions I got from the support desk at Lenovo did not work either."
5,Dictionary of Philosophy and Religion by Reese,"I have owned earlier edition of this work for a number of years. I have consistently found it to be the best dictionary for philosophical and religious terms, superior to others that I own. I'm glad to have this revised version now and look forward to using it for many years to come. Very highly recommended."
5,A Cure for Boredom,"When I am bored with everything, this is one of the books I like to pick up and browse through. There's so much material here, I'm bound to find something interesting or even inspiring."
1,The play is better,"I recently was a part of the production of this show at my university, and after performing the show and working with it for over 4 months, i was disappointed when i finally watched the film. The rewrites changed much of the emotional content of the story, and actually made it harder to understand. Finally, when it comes right down to it, i felt that Dick van Dyke missed many of the traits for the character. It's an excellent show, and if it's ever being performed in a close vicinity to yourself, then go see it! but the film is not nearly as good. And also, it's a good show assuming the lead actors understand the roles...since the entire story hinges on two characters, they are extremely important and can either help or destroy the show.Also, contrary to what somewhat else said, Milan Stitt wrote the play in the 70's, and then rewrote the screenplay very soon after it was a hit on broadway in the same decade."
3,Better cgi than Jurrasic Park?,"Sorry Sorry Sorry, but NO! I watched this special with some other members of my family, and even though I am a dinosaur and cgi buff, this did little to impress me. The effects were sub-par. Saying they are better than JP is pure ignornace talking, and that is somewhat sad considering JP came out in 1994, 6 years before WWD. Some shots consisted of a ""head on a stick"" litteraly moved around by a wooden pole. The integration of cgi and real life terrain was not done well, look at Jurrasic Park, ILM knows how to do it correctly. If it were not so focused on it's sub-par effects work, this would be a great documentary, but stop with the ignorant analysis of the effects work, they could have been done better, much better.As a documentary, it was quite informative, though as most do, it was mearly all the previous documentary's pulled into one, with few fresh ideas."
3,"Don't buy the hype, this is a quite ordinary series","Graphically impressive for a BBC TV effort, but obtrusively overscripted, overblown and overplayed, with a touch too much melodrama and anthropomorphising. Even Branagh's voice over begins to grate. The ""natural history"" aspects were hard to swallow - you just can't forget that these aren't real creatures on screen - just CGI impressions of what these beasts MIGHT have looked like.The ultimate damnation is that these factors conspired to make a couple of the episodes actually BORING. Surely the cardinal sin.A passable series, with very nice effects, but groundbreaking only in the monstrous amount of hyperbole it still manages to generate."
3,Walking with myths is more like it,"From a technical side, beautiful, but from a factual side, not even close. If you enjoy incredible 3d animation, this is a great study, otherwise, you will be confronted with a lot of evolution and all the lies that come with it. Ever wonder why the dates stated by scientists are always different? Makes one wonder if any of them actually get it right?"
1,What? Not in widescreen?,I was truly excited about getting this for the family until I realized it is only in 4:3 format.Forget it. All recently-produced DVDs (I'll allow for certain classics to remain in original 4:3) should be in widescreen...anamorphic widescreen is best. I will not buy anything else.
5,DVD Narration the best,"Just a matter of factual correction: Kenneth Branaugh, world-renowned Shakesperian actor and director, is the original narrator. Avery Brooks was brought in to re-do the narration for the American audiences, who are supposedly too provincial and stupid to accept the narration with a British accent.Except, Branaugh's narration is infinitely better than Brook's overwrought version. Subtlety has never been Brook's long suit."
5,The special features are terrific,"One of the special features on the DVD is a sort of ""pop up videos"" behind-the-scenes feature that shows how they made a particular scene as it's playing out. It's like running commentary with video and is really terrific.The show itself is superb. Younger children may be frightened by some of the violence and I wish the sound was digital, but those are the only caveats. This show is fabulous for entertaining, informing and stimulating discussion and learning. Children should be told to keep in mind that much of the dinosaurs' behavior, etc. is speculative, but that is just another great point to prompt discussion. A truly wonderful video."
4,A CGI delight for all the family about Dinosaurs,"This was a 6 part BBC documentary through Triassic, Jurasic & Cretaceous periods of pre history following many different species of Dinosaur and a few early mammals.However this is a documentary with a difference ! As it has been filmed as if you were there amongst these huge beasts watching them grow, eat, fight and all the other things Dinosaurs may have done.The Best thing about this series of docos is the Computer Generated animals - they really bring to life all that was those millions of years ago, from flying reptiles, huge meat eaters and of course... the long necks !Congratulations to the BBC on a very courageous and fun series on Dinosaurs - the kids will love it."
5,JELLO AGAIN!,"I thought this was a spectacular effort on the part of the animators and very well put together. Some of the science behind it was a little iffy but on the whole, a great job! Watch out for the Jello."
5,walking with dinos,"I LOVE THIS DINOSAUR FILM. AND AS I MENSIONED BEFORE MY FAVORET EPISOD IS GIANT OF THE SKY. IT COULD BE BETTER IF THERE WASN'T ALL THE BABY EATING. BUT IF YOU WANT THE TOTAL EXSEARIENS GET THIS AND WWB,DINOSAUR PLANET,ALLOSAURUS,CBD,PREHISTORECK PLANET,AND WHEN DINOSAURS ROAMED AMERICA. ALSO GET THE BOOK WWD!"
4,Almost great but not quite,"The drawings are magnificent but much of the CGI movement lacks the seamless motion of the Jurassic Park films. When close-ups are involved, the film makers used silly looking puppets that somewhat diminishes the effect. The story lines, while interesting are clearly greatly fictionalized. After awhile I found myself thinking, ""Come on, how could they have possibly known THAT."" But overall it is definitely worth a look and hopefully it will inspire other film makers to continue in this vein."
4,real dinosours on t.v,"For any of us who always wanted to know about dinosours: their feeding, size, reproduction, ... thus their living , this is perfect way to have a close view of these creatures that we were just able to imagine so far.Nevertheless I've found these collection rather short ignoring futher details about these creatures that many people might miss, somehow it is supposed to be a mere overview.All and all excelent special effects ,very good piece of work for t.v."
3,Walking with Dinosaurs review,"Walking with Dinosaurs consists of six episodes. They are New Blood, Time of Titans, Cruel Sea, Giant of the Skies, Spirits of the Ice Forest, Death of a dynasty. The problem with walking with dinosaurs is that in the first episode, it didn't show dinosaurs like the Eoraptar and the Herrosaurus. There were only 2 species of dinosaur. Coelophysis and the Plateosaurus (at the end). One of the best parts of the making is the end when a Raptor comes up with a cigarette and says, ""animator, those animators, chase this dinosaur chance that dinosaur"" and other stuff. Get walking with Prehistoric Beasts instead."
3,although Avery Brooks appears on the credits hes not narrating.,"It the visuals rock, its got great directing and writing. you know all this already. what you may want to know is that this version, thought avery brooks is listed is not narrated by him. for me this is bad news as i am a big fan of the US television narrated version, this features the british version. yes its uncut, but i still wish avery brooks version had appeared on the dvd as listed. this kenny guy is just BORING. he reads like its a grocery list for someone he doesnt even like.it would get a full five if avery was narrating, but with kenny's voice its only a 3."
5,Wonderful!,"As a long-time homeschooling parent (20+ years) I can honestly say that this was my all-time favorite preschool resource. I used it repeatedly with all my kids. Crafts, nature study, fun activities, easy games ... all arranged seasonally. Perfect. :-)"
5,Great book: Seems like a compilation of lots of timeless ideas,"I love that this book teaches how to do things yourself, from drying apples and churning butter to making your own simple toy ribbon wands and leaf crowns. Rather than having to rely on a store for something new, this book encourages teachers to instruct children on how to do it themselves. Many of the activities use natural materials that could be acquired during a short nature walk.NB: Check this out at the library, but do not pay the exorbitant price ($100) for a used copy, especially since the author has a similar, reasonably price book in print called Earthwise.Earthwise: Environmental Crafts and Activities with Young Children"
4,Entertaining & Enjoyable,"If your a Prince fan, information about the man is always at a premium and difficult to get. This DVD talks with a former band mate and sound engineers. There are some entertaining stories about how songs were created and Prince's personality and creative process. I thought it was a well done production of his ""grory years."""
3,Poorly Made,"Some good concert footage and interviews, but this documentary is poorly produced. This is a ""B-movie"" type of production."
1,Not what I had in mind,"I bought this book for more meal ideas, and since buying it, it has done nothing more than collect dust on my shelf. There are no pictures in the book, and the 3 recipies that I did try out of it, came out horrible. Many of the ingredients are expensive or hard to find, and most kids won't even look at anything in the book as appetizing.I do not recommend this book to anyone."
3,The Good and the Bad,"This video isn't bad ... however, you could delete almost all of the section on Crowley lake ... who really cares about sitting in a boat and jigging nymphs off the bottom in a still deep-water cove? Might as well be 2 - 12 year old kids drowning worms with a bobber! The spot on Hot creek was good, but woefully short in both time and in fishing action, as the primary and most attractive stream in the area. Shoud have also had a whole section on the Upper and Lower Owens, as well as some of the other waters / creeks in the area, rather than almost none at all. And the back country fishing, while enjoyable and a little informative, could have been a lot better destinations than simply catching a bunch of 8 inch ""wild"" fish - those may be fun, but they're not a compelling reason to go."
3,Chairman of the Board tackles New Music in '68,"Conducted by Bill Miller, and arranged by Don Costa, ""Cycles"" finds Sinatra tipping his hat to Joni Mitchell & some Nashville songwriters, among others. Nothing here swings, nor is it meant to.Sinatra tears into the opening track, ""Rain In My Heart,"" in bombastic fashion, his baritone strong. And he turns in an oddly-infectuous, nicely-phrased ""From Both Sides, Now,"" though I wish he would have told the organist/harpsicordist to go scram. Other good tracks include a smooth, reflective ""Cycles,"" a sincere ""By the Time I Get To Phoenix,"" and a nicely-orchestrated, nicely sung ""Gentle On My Mind.""Regretfully, ""Moody River"" found its way onto a Sinatra album...Lastly, the album's cover is one of the great Sinatra shots ever. Either a dame has just broken his heart, or he's wondering why he puts up with all us clowns."
3,An uneven album,"By Sinatra's standards, this is a weak album.Yes, CYCLES, BY THE TIME I GET TO PHOENIX and LITTLE GREEN APPLES are done very very nicely. Especially the 1st two songs fit Sinatra to a T!The rest of the songs are so so.....Compared to the MY WAY album, this one pales.This was Sinatra's first Middle of the Road attempt with Costa and they got better as they went along."
1,bummer,I did not like this at all. Don't know what I was expecting but this CD turned out to be soooooo depressing.
3,Not my favorite Sendak book,"Although there elements of this story that I enjoyed, this is not my favorite Sendak book. I'm glad I got it out of the library but I have no intention of purchasing it. For the record, my favorites are: The Night Kitchen, Where the Wild Things Are, Chicken Soup With Rice, and Outside Over There."
5,Great little charger,"been using mine for almost a year and it works great to keep the batteries fully charged, even if the vehicle sits for months."
4,Review of the pipe and drum,"If you like Scottish pipe and drum songs then this is the CD for you. If not, well, it is what it says it is."
4,Great work pants,"These are excellent work pants. I would recommend them to anyone. They are well made, heavy duty, and have five belt loops. Also reinforced knees. They make excellent fishing pants in cooler weather."
5,riggs work wear,these are exactly what I wanted. purchased as a uniform pant for my son. a 36 length pant is not easy to find. they were perfect for his use for work or just casual wear. Didn't realize Wrangler made these kind of pants especially in that length
5,Order a size up,"These seem a little smaller for its size. I had to return it and order one size up. They are a tight fit too. So, I recommend you guys to order one size up just in case. Aside from the size issue, it is heavy duty! Great stitching work and it feels extremely durable.UPDATE: I changed the review from a 4 star to a 5 star after sizing up one size. It's a perfect fit!"
1,Buyer Beware.,"The pants that i ordered were suppose to be some what grey/stone. But the color of the pants that i bought were Forest green, and whrn i attempted to put them on they did not fit. They are not true to size. I cant seem to get ahold of the seller, so i guess im out of luck. Guess thats what i should of expected when ordering online. Was surprised to see all the good reviews considering my experience was not so pleasant."
5,nice pants,"Very comfortable and durable, food fit, great for working outdoors in cold weather. A bit too heavy for summer. I would certainly buy this again."
1,not the same as the ones i purchased from wrangler.com .....,I have been buying these for my husband for the past few years from wrangler.com - these are not the same im thinking they may have been seconds were cut HUGE my hubby is drowned by them.
4,Ruff fabric,"Overall good product however, the pocket material is ruff and gives me the chills everytime I put my hand in them.If you have dry skin like me you might not like these pants."
5,Great pants,These are comfortable and durable. Fit is very good. Love the eased seat area. They are a great work pant.
3,"nice, but need a relaxed fit version",the color is closer to green than what this pic looks like. i'm a weightlifter and I have thick legs and a butt...these work pants fit me tight and they need to make different style cuts.
4,"Good quality, fit well. thinking about purchasing another pair or two",good quality. wear well. going to purchase a few more pairs. leather pocket protector for tape measure and other pockets are well placed.
1,Very disappointed,"Ordered the same size that I have ordered both on line and purchased direct from stores, these must have shrunk on the plane. Have spent $90.00 on freight for a product that is not measured at an industry standard"
3,Save a few bucks!,"This is the first time I'm not satisfied with Amazon. I bought both a pair of Riggs Ranger pant and a pair of Riggs Workwear Carpenter pant. Other than the colors I selected they're both identical in every way. However, the Carpenter pant are $6.00 cheaper than the Ranger pant. The quality of both manufacturing and fit are excellent though and I'm sure I'll get a lot of miles wearing them for years to come. The only reason I don't give a 5 star rating is because I feel I was ripped off the extra $6.00 because the tag said ""Ranger"" instead of ""Carpenter"". Save your money and get the Carpenter pant, I'm sure you'll enjoy them."
1,Not very durable,I bought a pair of these pants and they didn't last two days before the crotch tore out of them. Seems like the only pants that last long are blue jeans anymore. Unless I am doing something wrong the crotch tear out is a major issue with all non-blue jean pants I buy.
5,yes they are that good.,I got these to replace my warnout carhearts and I have no plans of going back. The added features for the difference in price point make these Riggs are worth their wait on the job.
2,You need to be aware of fit!,I ordered the first pair of pants. Tried them on when I got them and they did not fit. I had read the reviews for these pants and they had said sizes we're odd so I ordered them a little large. The pants are very good quality and crafted well but it seemed that they would have fit a woman better than myself even at 2 sizes larger I could not button the pants and was swimming in the rest of the pant. All total I tried 2 pairs as to be fair neither fit I sent both back for refund.
4,Almost perfect,"Pros- Durable, fit good, nice color, good attention to detail on stress pointsCons- front pockets could be cut better for more hand room"
5,"Solid, well-wearing and durable pants","I'm a geek. I've always needed more pockets to carry tools or gadgets.These pants are made from a solid fabric; lighter than denim, heavier than 'chino' or average dress wear. After 4 washings / machine dry cycles - I don't notice any shrinkage.. but I wash cold, and dry gentle.They don't wrinkle as much as some fabrics - but they are NOT wrinkle-free.Fabric has a solid construction and drape, but is not constrictive.Another plus was the availability of large waist sizes.+1 - fit matches measurements+1 - large sizes available+1 - launders well+1 - durability+1/2 - styled well+1/2 - pockets!-1/2 - fabric is slightly coarse4.5 stars - rounded to 5...I'd definitely buy again, but I will try to hold out for a sale."
2,not so happy,"I was looking for a light weight but yet durable work pant.. These pants are definately durable but also pretty heavy so I definately do not recommend wearing these in the summer. They also aren't that flexible either they will hinder your movement a little.. Pants are also way longer than size says I took and had 4 inches cut off the legs... They however do have many pockets , leather reinforced pockets if your right handed (which I'm not....) Hammer loop is way to small for a real hammer ...Stilletto that is!!!"
3,NOT true to size.,"In spite of what other reviews say, these pants DO NOT RUN TRUE TO SIZE. The pants run 2 inches larger than the actual measured size. (A ""size 34"" is actually 36 inches at the waist.) I guess the comments about the pants running small come from people who are used to the vanity sizes used by many manufacturers, which are often 3-4 inches smaller than measured sizes, but to get pants that fit, actually measure the waist on a pair that fit you, with the waistband stretched tight when you do the measuring, then order a size 2 inches down from the size you measured. Note that the prices at Orchard Supply Hardware (yes, you can buy pants in a hardware store) are as good as this vendor's prices, and you can actually look at the pants before you buy them. My local OSH stocks only the ""bark"" and dark-brown colors, though)."
2,Good material; Good fit,Pay no attention to the 2 stars. It should be 4 stars. We bought the wrong size - it was our fault. We got our money back (minus a $5 shipping fee - only fair) immediately. We then bought the right size and now are very happy with them.
2,Good quality but the size was way off,"When I got these in the mail I was impressed with the quality and construction and could not wait to wear them however once I tried them on they were way too small in the waist. I always buy 32x36 pants and even though I could get them snapped there was no way I could wear them for any length of time. In my case I wish I had ordered the 34"" waist instead. The seam to run a little small..."
3,Work pants,"Use, Residential Constructionpurchased 10 pair estimating 48 months of service, review written after 2 weeks and 2 washesComfort, Great lots of room to move yet not too baggyCost, reasonableDurability, still to early to say. I anticipated that the Hammer holder at the side will get caught and tear, but that hasn't happened yet.The snap down button on the right pocket broke, odd because I don't use the snap down pockets"
5,Great Work Pants!,"I just received these pants and they're superb - heavy duty fabric and great pockets! The cargo pockets are secued by brass snaps and all the stitching is high quality. The sizing runs true, and they look great - they're wonderful work pants!"
3,mount,"The mount works fine. I do wish it were 'nicer.' The paint appears to just be paint, and not powder coat. The insides of the handles are not painted and I bet they will rust. The part that goes into the receiver was not cut straight and I was dying to put it on my milling machine and fix it but it was too big for my mill. I would have paid $20 more for another $5 in fit and finish."
5,The Summer Intern is great!,"I just bought THE SUMMER INTERN and loved it! It had a slow opening but then it really took off! The actors were great, the writing was a hooty and it told me that even a jug like me can have a future if I believe in myself. It's got gobs of pretty girls, wild ostriches and the biggest bicycle in America. I saw Wayne Larsen, the star in Decampitated and he is like Tom Cruise in the one! And Barry Hickey as the villain? Move over bad guys, Hickey is super bad! If you're stuck in a deadend career, you gotta buy it or rent it! It will open your eyes up to the future!Grunnion."
4,enjoyable movie,"I watched ""The summer intern"" and was pleasantly surprised by the satire,comedy and smooth direction of this flick.The cast was first rate.Check it out."
5,Genius!,"This film is, pure and simple, a masterpiece.Anyone in Hollywood should watch this movie and hire this director to do $100 million dollar projects. I was entraced by the plot, blown away by the camerawork, the music was phenomenal and the acting was superb.Funny, witty and charming, this movie is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest with a little bit of Animal House, Debi Does Dallas, American Graffiti and Death Race 2000 thrown in for good measure. It's like beef stew only more flavorful!"
4,Puts on a neat show -- had a good time indeed (listening),"This is one of the four 'actual', albums I have with the Black Mountain Poet -- Robert Creeley reading his subtle, yet fascinating work. If you love to mix the beuateous worlds of an excellent Jazz band with some of the best words ever written, being said in an indeed original and mezmerizing tone, this album is for you. If you don't like live Jazz (as occasionally me) it is easy to forget it is live, it is a non-stop scent of music that enters you on this album, and I loved Robert Creeley long before Jazz interested me -- although he reads the same (albeit great) poems he reads as in the album entitled with his name. ""Have we Told you all you thought to know"" seems to quicken appreciation of his phrasing with a Great Jazz Band...""is it really, so quickly, now the time to go?"""
1,Cold Comfort,"If you have trouble spelling 'Scandinavian' or 'February', one might refrain from presenting a literary review. Oddly appropriate for the mediocre book, however.I've made this review as fun as I possibly can. How many more words will it be necessary for me to submit for this comment? Is there any consideration for economy of expression available for those who wish to present an intelligent review of a book on Amazon.com?"
3,Comfortible review.,The book cold momfort was not to bad at the bigining but got in to a lot of chapters of the BWCA withc I did not cair fore.All in all the book was good some chapters but wordy in other chapters.
4,Reader from Israel,"An excellent book, and to think that if I had never lived in Duluth I would have missed out on such a great author. He reminded me of Bill Bryson in a way, another one of my favorites!"
5,PS I love you,This book is really helpful for someone making a quilt for a child. I made 3 quilts for this book. You will like it.
4,"Simply, beautifully displays the power of percussion","In 1980 this was a breakthrough album, consisting of dynamic performances by master drummer / percussionists showcasing warmth, humor, intensity, and picture-painting. ""World Music"", American jazz, future primitive music fusing traditions of innovation. The melodic lines of vibes, marimba and xylophone blend with the power of timpanis, drumset, congas, claves and the rest of the M'Boom artillery. If you like Santana, Spyro Gyra, Gary Burton, Airto, Mickey Hart, or Combustible Edison you should check out this album. It's a gem. By the way, M'Boom is a large group of fine musicians organized by Max Roach -- it isn't Max on his own."
3,No need for dual hose,"Great unit works well. Hose connections are a little flimsey. However the dual hose makes no sense. You can't use it when it's very hot, it works harder to cool new air rather than recirculate. That argument that you get fresh air (more oxygen )just doesn't cut it. Also with 2 hoses it's harder to put in place. It's a BIG unit something I didn't consider. Understand the dimensions relative to your space."
1,Definitly not a air conditioner I would recommend,"This is a very poor built air conditioner. When I unboxed the item, it was leaking oil. So I went ahead and setup this portable air conditioner in my office to see if it would work. This is a very heavy and isn't easy to move from room to room. It doesn't cool very well even on the lowest temperature. The coolest temp. I could get after running it for 24 hours was 70 degrees. This was during the evening hours after the sun went down and not during the day. So I returned it and got something different."
3,what bonus?,"this is a great kylie album , a really different SAW sound .the disappointment is the bonus cd which contains just 3 tracks - instrumental versions of the 3 singles . see if you can find a different edition instead of paying more for the 2 disc set"
2,Contains some good nuggets of information,"This book does contains some useful information which should come in handy during vacation. It is also delivered in a really off-beat humorous way.Unfortunately, if you can't get into the humor, it will be a very painful digging operation for the content. I would suggest reading a few pages in your local bookstore before purchasing.In retrospect, I probably would not have purchased this book if I had an example of the writing style."
2,I'd go elsewhere,"This isn't totally useless, but it's not all that great either. Allusions are tough to decipher and the writing is more ""cute"" than informative (or funny for that matter). No maps and disappointingly little of use for snorkelers, which is interesting given the man's business. It's not even as pointed as you would think, although it does get a bit vulgar and enviro-political (oh goodie) at points. Book is from 1997 so some reviews may be out of date.The guy has writing talent but generally misses the mark. You'll find better info on Hawaii in any number of other guides."
2,Okay For a Freebie,"I certainly wouldn't pay money for this book.It had a small amount of good info, but in the end I felt it wasn't worth suffering through the rest to find.I agree with the other reviewers who were disappointed in the lack of snorkeling info and maps.I skimmed most of the book and was sick of SB at the end."
1,"I wouldn't pay money for this ""guide""","The lack of snorkeling info, and maps? Inexcusable considering the guy's name. There is some decent info though of restaurants and places to stay. But I'm not a fan of his writing style either. I won't even get into this guy's lack of knowledge about fish."
4,Better Than Most,"This item arrived about a week after my order was placed. Not well packed by Amazon but the orignial package inside was in good shape. This is a good machine for the price. The 8"" disc is a huge difference over the more standard 6"" models. It has a good heavy base that does not have to be bolted down to a bench. Most of the adjustment handles are made of a cheap light plastic and overtime I suspect they will not hold up well. Otherwise, the machine power, size, adjustments and performance are good."
2,False advertising,"I ordered this product from Amazon long before Christmas 2006. It finally came February 2007, but was badly damaged because of sub standard shipping provided by a cut rate company. I sent the product back and asked Amazon to ship VIA UPS instead. They said they would, but the same cut rate company delivered my second tool, and it was also damaged. I kept it to give to my son since it was his Christmas present. I reported to Amazon that the item was not advertised correctly. I waited a long time for this tool because it was advertised as a 15 amp, 4/5 horsepower disc/belt sander. When it arrived, it is only 6 amp, same as Sears, Home Depot, or anywhere else. It seems the false advertising has still not been corrected."
3,Much smaller,"Very nice colors. Excellent quality. (thick, not thin)Only thing is that I thought a 2 cup item would be larger, thinking that their ""2 cup"" description meant that it would hold 2 cups of nuts, candy, or whatnot.I actually ""tested"" it with a 2 cup measuring cup. The bowl only held the entire 2 cups of water because the water sort of ""rounded up"" and thus didn't go over the edge of the bowl.If you plan to use it as a serving dish, as I did, you'll need to plan on about 1 cup to 1 1/2 cups of food product. If you need a 2 cup untensil, buy something else because the food would spill out if anyone dipped a spoon into it for their serving."
3,Small but useful for peanuts only,"Well made and colours are gorgeous, unfortunately they are very very small; will just be a display rather than practical use"
2,Disappointed in quality,"I bought the bowl for a gift, and when it arrived I noticed some some small gouges on the inside and spots where the colors were not consistent. The overall idea was great, but I wouldn't consider giving the bowl as a gift with these imperfections. I returned it to Amazon for credit, and as always, the customer service was excellent."
2,"Be Aware ""Malware"" Broke on first day","The whole unit is cheaply made and junky. The top is supposed to flip to open, but this broke on the first day. The slide that coils the headset wire did not work for me. Would not buy again."
2,NOT SO HOT,"The first two cuts are excellent recordings, but there are only 3-4 artists on this CD playing real instruments. Everything else is done with a synthesizer...as in synthetic. Very disappointing."
3,Easy read for brand new therapists. Not for experienced clinicians.,"Just as the title says. If your new to the field or are just starting to see clients then this book is great. However, for the more experinced clincians this book is a little to simplistic. Cozolino does a good job of talking about his own inadequacies as a young therapist. There are also some good examples of countertransferance which he has experinced as well as how he has helped other new therapists through difficult situations with difficult clients."
3,"Good? Yeah, but not the best!","This isn't really even the best of what we KNOW Columbia has in the can.First, while the Montreux live material isn't quite as astonishing as it was nearly three decades ago, (and the sound is VERY analog) it's still an astonishing set of work by a young and agressive band, tearing stuff off for an international audience of cognicenti for the first time. Why isn't the live set complete, and augmented by live stuff that Columbia released on the ""Havana Jam"" festival album?(which also included the John McLauglin/Jaco Pastorius duets?)Next, there was a studio version of Chekere Son on Columbia, which has vanished from release, along with other GOOD studio stuff, supplanted here by some fairly weak material.And then there's the liner notes. As noted by other reviewers, they're messed up.So, get it for the Montreux set, and PESTER Sony to release the goods!"
3,The 3 instrumental cuts make it worthwhile,"I've had this CD for years and couldn't remember why it was that I had not played in a long time. The answer? The vocal tunes. Although there are 10 cuts in this CD, the three instrumental ones are worth the price by themselves. The other 7, unfortunately, feature mostly annoying lyrics or simulated African chants.I took the 3 instrumental cuts and transferred them to a blank CD. Those 19 minutes of music are worth the price of the whole disc. I just wish the vocalist would have just stayed home on the other 7 cuts; this would have been one great overall CD.If anything, get this CD to hear the variation on Mozart's theme. The sax solo (I assume it was Paquito D'Rivera, sounds just like him) smokes.The cliché ""less is more"" fits the bill; those 3 cuts together are greater than the original 10."
2,Not So Great,"This product did love live up to its description. It was runny and did a very poor job of helping to hold a style. I must admit that the product did get quite warm when it was sent to me and even leaked from the jar. When I told the seller, they just said, ""sorry"" and did not to replace it.However, it has a very greasy component that just weighs my hair down. I won't buy it again."
1,Old and degraded,"This is the third time I have tried to buy this product on Amazon. Each time I found it is no longer in it's gel form, but is degraded into a greasy, useless product. Don't waste your time ordering and then returning this product."
2,45 yr old Latin female always looking for great music,"Buddha Bar was a total let down- Found it boring, deja vu, I wondered what the big hype was all about- Of the two CD's, I found 5 good (not wow) pieces, and realized that the price went mostly for the expensive packaging. Some of it may sound great at some disco played loud, but for a home party, it is not inspiring. In fact, one gets tired of the same sound, mostly laid back, repetitive, some 70's type beat, some New Age, - it doesn't grab you and it certainly doesn't get a party going- Not worth the price. Have played it 3 times already to give it a chance and I still don't look forward to hearing it- The five that ""passed the test"" can be forgetable in no time. In fact, the melodies don't seem to stick. This is a way overrated CD for any demanding taste and can easily do without it. I didn't miss anything if I hadn't ordered it. But I'm glad I did- now I know what Claude Challe's taste in music is and I'm no fan of his."
1,The PRICE is far from Zen !,"If you spend the outrageous price on any of these compilations then you really have too much money.My suggestion is that you look at buying the ""K&D sessions"" by Kruder & Dorfmeister or any of the compilations titled ""Buddha Beats"", ""Karma Beats"" or ""Krisna Beats"". Even the Cafe Del Mar compilations are better value.Sure the Buddha Bar in Paris is great but it is nothing unique, special or worthy of this price for 2 CDs ! Can someone please explain why we need to pay this price to someone who probably thinks more about being a yuppie than a hippy ?With the money you save donate it to Amnesty or any free Tibet organization."
5,Superb,Well there's not much to say about this cd.Words will not describe this heavenly music. This cd should be on top of all chill compilations ever released. Buy or die.
5,Claude's the man !!!,"Wow, what an experience. I heard about this not too long ago (5 months) and now i have all their CD's all 6. The music is mesmerising and relaxing and its safe to say that its ""Next Generation"" Music. Definitely one of the best out there now and US is missing out.. (too much hip-hop here)The best east meets west fusion compilations can be found in all their CD's and this one definitely is the best.Visited Buddha Bar while I was in Paris in September and was blown away by the ambience. One of the best restaurants/bars and get ready to greet the Buddha in NYC. Yes..!!! Feb 2005 Buddha Bar opens in NYC.Grab the CD and you wont be disappointed ..."
1,Total disappointment,"Should've bought something else instead...I found only one track that was awesome, the rest was just OK, I could live without it."
2,Funky background music... nothing else..,"I have no idea what the hype is all about, it's not a bad music, but only good for hangging out around the house, reading, having dinner... not more.... and way over priced too...."
5,Wow!,"I heard this CD playing in a vegetarian restaurant one evening and felt like I was in a different country. I had to have it! This music is sassy, upbeat and driving while at the same time it is also relaxing, meditative and calming. As each track plays you feel that you are traveling the world. A definite buy for anyone interested in the eclectic, international sounds of the world."
2,More is not always better,"This is a two-cd set: Buddha's Dinner and Buddha's Party. The dinner music is laid-back and easy listening. I would categorize it as lounge music. Some of the selections I already have in my collection of cds - that validates the appeal for the first cd. Worthy of a 4 star rating.The party music is dance music. Too much vibe, too much rhythm and not much else. In all likelyhood it will not be played again. Best described as a lot of noise. Not worthy of any stars.The Buddha Lounge is a far better compilation of lounge music with an etherial feel."
4,"...from ArtsyFartsy News, August 2011","The World Groove music scene started years ago and one of the pioneers was Claude Challe, the owner and creator of Buddha Bar restaurant/clubs and music compilations. Buddha-Bar 1 is the original 2-CD set that started the whole thing! Buddha's Dinner and Buddha's Party. Fourteen songs on each CD. This is ""dreamworld stuff for your studio."" One just has to sit back and enjoy the ride... through this magical universe. The sounds are eclectic, timeless and atmospheric. It's a feel good journey between dreams and reality. This is one of the many Buddha Bar types I listen to while painting. The CD set is one of the originals so it may be a challenge to dig up, is pricey, but a real ""find"" to add to your collection.[...]"
1,total disappointment!,"I am french myself, I live in the U.S and I like to keep up with french music. The reviews and everything else(the price...)made me expect a sensationnel album.What a disappointment!...well, lets put it this way: if you love yonni, enya, dido, moby you will probably love this!If you like something less commercial sounding like:massive attack, portishead,kruder and dorfmeister,costes by stephane pompougnac,dj cam,do yourself a favor and save your bucks.Where was ""music fan"" of new york when I bought this?! I totally agree with him I feel ripped off!"
1,I went for the cheap option and that is what I got!,I wanted some really inexpensive pulls for a project I was working on and these were the cheapest pulls I could find. It turns out they are completely useless! They come with aluminum screws that broke when torque was applied to them. If you want to buy these pulls I warn you to use your own screws! It seems that you get what you pay for.
1,unacceptably heavy and hard,"This chair weighs 66 pounds! The seat is very hard and is awkwardly leaning forward, so one ends up sliding down. The back is poorly designed so that an average height person would constantly hit her head on the metal frame behind. It's next to impossible to disassemble for shipping it back. The arm rests are not adjustable in height."
5,Very pleased,For this CD to be as old as it is I was glad to get it and see that it still played great. Plus the music is so beautiful!
2,Not so good,"This is not really and entertaining movie. The beauty of the starlets just doesn't make up for the lack of story and..., creativity. Can't reccomend."
2,A Summer In Saint Tropez,"A not so great movie for adults to watch, but teens would probably want to see it."
1,poorly-photographed pederasty,"This is absolutely the most boring and inaccurately portrayed movies of all time. Imagine a Monet painting being shown on film, with no dialogue, for several hours. Boring, right? Even after you checked out the ballerina's breasts? That's this film.My first problem with this film is the premise: that girls at a girls' school would choose to caress and share tender moments with one another. Everyone knows that women of this age are just beginning to use their claws, and--like puppies--their claws are now the sharpest they will ever be. Every one of these girls should be in a mad, jealous, catfight to appeal to the few men in the film--but instead, they seem to want solely to touch one another or play mild, hilarious pranks.Secondly, the ""artistic"" mood detracts from the pornography (if you're into that), and the ""pornographic"" scenes detract from the artistry. This film is an overall loser, neither here nor there, that deserves nothing more than your contempt."
5,The quintessential book on the best roadracing series ever.,"Renowned automotive author, Pete Lyons, has utilized his mastery of the writer's craft to compile the only chronology of the fabulous Can-Am roadracing series. His opening passage, describing in careful detail the author's chance ride in one of the ultra-powerful cars, is so intense the reader may find himself gripping his seat, leaning into the turns, and unable to put the book down."
4,More war stories from Sarajevo.,"I read Dizdarevic's first book, and I think this is as good as the first. Both books are rather brief, so they could have been combined with a book of only 300 pages. However after the success of the first, the publisher probably wanted to make a little more money on a second book of war stories. That said, the stories are powerful about the cruelity of war and its consequences. Some of the stories at the end are the most powerful, especially about the wayward boy looking for his father in the trenches. Some of the others, the reader is left scratching his/her head on what the author was trying to convey. This is simply a collection of stories from the residents of Sarajevo to the outside world.For a quick read on the siege of Sarajevo, both Dizdarevic's Sarajevo: A War Journal and this book are good human interest reads. The reader can go through them in a three hour sitting."
1,Steiner Sports Auctions - Major Disappointment,"I recently bid on and won an auction on the Steiner Sports website. The auction was for a VIP experience with the Great Hank Aaron. It was located at their Last Licks location in Armonk, NY Sept. 26th. The auction enabled me and a guest to be first in-line, for us to take a picture with Mr. Aaron and get an item signed.The ""VIP"" line was filled with friends of the employees working at the store....I was number 17 in-line. No a big deal, I'll be in the first 17......wrong. They started to pull 10 people from the ""general"" line and every one VIP. So, an hour later I was still in line and by the time a get to the front to get my item signed. They say that no photographs are allowed.I paid over $500 for the right to get an autograph that I could have paid $130. What a major disappointment.Buyer beware when dealing with Steiner Sports."
2,"Ok, but not the same","I must say that this is my opinion only, but the Little Princess dolls put out by ""DISNEY"" are not as cute as the dolls made by Playmates Toys. These Disney dolls are ok, but I have found the hair to be thin, and the joints a little too stiff. It could be just the doll we have. I was personally disapointed by these and I will stick to buying the dolls from Playmates Toys. They are much cuter, better made and come with really adorable accesories!"
3,My Girl Movies With No Full Score,"I recently got My Girl. I didn't like the 60 and 70'os music except for My Girl by The Temptations. On that cd, they had Vada's Theme which I'm glad they had one. But they didn't have a full cd of the score. Now that I'm ordering the 2nd one by Cliff Eidleman, it's beautiful I wish they had a full score for this one as well. James & Cliff have amazing scores. I'm finding more and more, with score composers that they don't release score tracks for certain movies, I just wish I knew why, anyone know? They did the same for the movies Ice Princess and some of the Harry Potter films that the music was in the movie, just not the cd. I'm only getting My Girl 2 for the My Girl 2 suite and for Baby Love by The Supremes , other than that, it's ok!!"
1,Never worked,"I ordered this CD twice, and both of them were blank or did not play in any player I tried, so after 2 attempts, I asked for and received a refund."
1,I am bummed!,I liked this movie and thought it would be fun to have the sound track. However the cd does not work at all. All of my players find nothing on the disc. I have e-mailed Amazon and the e-mails were ignored. Not sure I will buy cds from them any more---since they do not seem to stand behind them!
3,This movie is the best halloween animated movie,"Lumpin the pumpkin is about a pumpkin & 4 witches.3 of the witches hate the one witch's daughter.Shes always being nice to everyone.They have to pick a pumpkin for the grand witch contest & the witches daughter,Tara,picks out a one thats smiling.This is when we meet Lumpin.Tara helps Lumpin with his problems & he makes Tara win the contest."
3,The Kids like it.,"The video is not animated all that well, but the music (all sung by Bobby Goldsboro) is above average. My only other comment would be that the bad witches could talk a bit nicer."
5,Boo...and I mean it!,"Again, another great Junie B. book. My young daughters love Barbara Parks books. It's so rewarding to hear giggles and full out laughter coming from my daughters bedroom as they read her books on the their bedroom floors."
5,"Ooh, It's a Scary Clown!","Halloween is fast approaching, but this is one holiday Junie B. Jones is not excited about. In fact, she's a bit scared and upset. It seems that crazy boy Paulie Allen Puffer is at it again --- he told Junie B. five scary secrets about Halloween that have soured her on the holiday. Despite the fact that Paulie Allen's information has been bad in the past, Junie B. is still scared. She tries to literally hide from the holiday and doesn't want to go shopping for a Halloween costume.Junie B. gets a great idea on how to overcome her Halloween fears. It's a funny idea, but one that exasparates her Mom.This book is full of the usual clever humor including some funny bits about candy corn not be real corn and ""thank you"" sometimes being a fib.This story really isn't too different from any normal Junie B. Jones story. Most fans of the series will likely eat this up, just like a bag of candy."
2,"It was good, but......","I am a Social Worker, whom does a lot of work with people that are homeless. I was very interested in this video for so many reasons. I thought it was great video because all the work were done by the people in the video. I just didn't like the way it ended. I thought it gave false hope. I think it a must see, but will warnings."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FOR WHAT I PAID FOR!,This is definitly the type of documentary that you just want to watch once. Not something you want to waste your money on.
2,Aesthetically Pleasing,"Great to look at -- in the tradition of Eraserhead or Freaks.But that's the troublesome aspect. It's mostly aesthetics, with a great backup score.Very little information, almost no social consciousness -- one would think it had been made decades ago. Singer objectifies the people in front of the lens shamelessly. Or perhaps he is just woefully behind the times and didn't know what he was doing. I would hope that was the case. But if you just want to see a good looking black and white film, it's got some great shots."
4,Patch,"I was initially interested in this movie very much but my expectations were totally wrong. I expected a weird, dark, twisted journey into the minds of people who could live underground in a subway tunnel. It wasn't like that at all. This is one of the most uplifting movies I've ever seen and a (cue cheesy reviewer soundbyte) remarkable meditation on the triumph of the human spirit. I swear to god, I mean that. It even has a happy ending. I don't want to tell you too much, but this movie was interesting, but it also made me feel really good. The human mind/spirit/being has an amazing ability to adapt and go on and infact (to a degree) flourish despite the everyday (...) of existance."
1,whatever,"the movie was interesting to look at with its unique look i think it captured what it really looks like down there. that is the best thing i care to say about the movie. i thought it was extremely boring. the character development was nill. if you like to watch homeless people ramble about nothing, then this is for you."
5,compelling,"From the moment this film began I was drawn in. This film and the lives it chronicles draws the viewer in from beginning to end. The homeless ""city"" under the streets of New York is truly an eye opener, and after the film is over, I found my sense of empathy and understanding for our fellow human beings, driven to this situation, expanded tenfold. The music of DJ Shadow, an artist who has, in his own right, produced some of the most ground-breaking and beautiful music in recent years, was an excellent choice for the scenes throughout. You'll learn to love the characters - real characters in this movie, as they invite us to take a peek into their world, and you'll learn these people are just like you and me but made some bad choices and fell on some bad luck. What you might take away most of all is that even in the bleakest of situations, there is a light, if only one chooses to seek it out."
5,Brilliant!,"When most of us think of homeless people, we think of someone who is a completely undesirable outcast. This film shows us that this isn't the case. While the people in this film have obviously made some very poor choices in their lives, they are still people. They are just trying to make the best of the situation that they're now in. I've gained a new respect for the homeless in watching this, and a new appreciation for all of the many blessings in this life. Dark Days is a very moving picture of what goes on in the forgotten places in our society. The people in this film have hit bottom. They now just desparately want to be able to move beyond their mistakes, and make a better start in life. Not only has the director captured a commonality not normally associated between ourselves and the homeless, but in the end, he actually gives them that new start! The film can be depressing at times, but in the end, it is very heartwarming! Don't miss it!"
4,Shoot to Kill,This is the first time I have read Wade Miller and I will most certainly want to read more of his books. The hero in this story is tough but he has a soft side that he does not like to show. I am really enjoying this first time for me author.
3,Not Bad But Could Be Better,"This book consists of Elgin's system of verbal behavior as a guide to better health, suggesting that mental health can affect physical health. Most of the information in here is repeated from previous Gentle Art series. Avid followers of Elgin's elegant Gentle Art system will be disappointed by the paucity of new material.For those who have never read any of Elgin's books, starting with her earlier writings will be a better investment."
4,Has A Nice Lesson,"Fourth Grade Rats is a story about two buddies named Suds and Joey. Suds is getting forced by Joey to become a mean rat. A rat for Joey is a person who is smelly, sloppy, bossy, fearless, and will never cry! Well.... I don't want to give the whole story away, so I won't get to far in detail. This book has a great lesson, but I'm leaving you to figure out what that lesson is. It is not the best book, but out of 10 I'd rate it 8. Jerry Spenelli did a nice job with this book, but I think he should add more humor. I hope you read this book!!!!!!!!"
3,Not for visual-spatials,"I bought this book based on reviews hoping that it would help my 8 year old son recall his math facts more quickly. He knows them, it's just not ""instant recall"". The book consists of stories that reason why one number plus another makes the sum. It is very, very, very wordy - so it's not a fast recall tool. Also, the associated pictures have a whole lot goin' on in them in dated ""Schoolhouse Rock"" cartoon style- very distracting. Since the facts have page long stories to go along with them, it is better suited for audio-sequential learners, not for visual-spatials who need to see it and have a picture stick in their minds. Note that that the stories are written out in about a 36pt font on glossy cardstock. It is really visually annoying and distracting - (Mommy is a visual-spatial also.) I would recommend this book for the basic introduction of math facts to an age range of about 3 or 4 years old."
5,What a Relief!!,"My 6 yo just simply couldn't get her math facts! We homeschool--and no curriculum seemed to work! I couldn't understand it, and would drill, and drill and drill! This was particularly troubling to me--because she is a VERY bright child--and has an amazing memory. When she was 2 she could recite an entire ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" episode from memory! She was also reading WELL at age 4. I found this product and thought--well if nothing else--she'll enjoy reading the stories. Boy--was I amazed to find out that after giving her the book to read on her own, she knew ALL her addition facts within one week. She said to me, ""I just needed the pictures Mom!""I have since purchased both the Times Alive CD Rom and the subtraction flash cards. She gets all her subtraction facts now too!This product was DEFINITELY worth it for me!"
2,Not impressed,"I was so excited to buy this book, as I had been looking for it for a really long time. I read the Introduction and the first two chapters and haven't finished. I have to say, the subject matter is interesting but the writing is terrible! She repeats herself constantly and the introduction chapter could be shortened to a page or less. I might pick it up and finish it eventually but I'm not in a rush. I bought a used copy because I thought $50 was ridiculous to spend on a book and I'm glad I did. Don't waste your money."
1,"Over-priced, Cheap, and WRONG SIZE","I bought this hoodie for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived on time, and that is the only positive thing I can say about it. The fabric is harsh and the hoodie was TINY even though I ordered an XL and the tag said XL."
4,GOOD,DIDN'T REALIZE THE COATING WOULD ADD TO SIZE. A LITTLE UNUSUAL SIZE ( + .0007 ) BUT A GOOD PRODUCT WELL PACKAGED
3,Not that bad,"Alright, now if you are really picky about sound then you shouldn't buy a fm transmitter, end of story. Just put your money towards a car stereo that has a direct input for mp3 players, OK? However if you don't mind not having crystal clear sound and interference once and a while, you'll be satisfied with this transmitter. Higher quality mp3's will sound just fine through this. mp3's ripped at a lower bitrate and audience recordings (live shows) will not sound good though. You do need to do some sound adjusting to your car stereo and possibly your mp3 player (ie turn up the volume, adjust bass/treble)."
5,Works great,This is a perfect item to fill in the gap if your car stereo has no other means to connect to your phone or mp3 player.
2,Doesn't work as well as advertized,Radio stations continue to bleed over CD player regardless of what station preset you use. It is also very noisy when CD not playing music.
1,A common misconception.,"Box stats have nothing to do with the actual quality of the top. You'd be better off getting Driger MS, who's box stats have nothing to do with the quality. Gaia... Er, Strata D'goon MS is much too fragile to be used in serious play. Like many things, it's pretty. Pretty useless, that is. Get it for the orange customize case."
1,worst blade,"when I read the reviews i was totally impressed by this blade so i decided to buy it. first when i saw it was just the attack ring that wobbled but later when i launched it, IT wasn't a battle i was just trying to test the spinning time the ATTACKRING BROKE INTO PIECES.believe me i wasn't battleing with anyone it was alone in the stadium IT JUST SUCK!!!!!! PLEASE DONOT BUY THIS.IT IS A LOSER......."
5,The Wiggles: Racing to the Rainbow,"Since my grandkids came along, we have become Wiggles fans. This video is one of MANY we have and it keeps them entertained. We have so much fun watching them sing and dance with the Wiggles. Very cute."
1,Worst Wiggles video I've ever watched!,"I'm scratching my head as I write this review (seeing all the positive reviews) because my 18 month old daughter absolutely ignored the DVD while it was running and that NEVER happens when the Wiggles are on! I could not stand the songs either. I guess I was looking for the typical Wiggle DVD filled with dances and songs. The songs were all new and unfamiliar and the spoken parts were just too drawn out. I found myself forwarding thru most of the DVD. Dont get me wrong, I love the Wiggles just as much as my daughter, but this DVD was a complete waste of time!"
1,Certainly not a great book ...,This could have been a delightful story. Instead it's marred by the author's irritating and frequent attempts at witty similies ... which fall flat and make no sense. Add to that a protagonist who's not all that appealing. Even the picture on the cover shows a wishy-washy boy who's easily led. I do not recommend this book.
3,Its a good book so far,"I liked this book, so many questions! So many answers!! It has one mistake: It referred to 1Thes 4 as the 2ed coming of Jesus. This passage of Scripture is not the 2ed coming. Its the Next Appearance of The Lord. There are 2 references to Jesus appearing in the New Testament. In 1Thes 4, Jesus will appear and take the Body of Christ away. Again, this is an appearance - Jesus will remain in the sky; He will not set foot on earth. Revelation talks about The 2ed Coming of The Lord when Jesus will set foot on the Earth, set up His Kingdom, etc. Common mistake, it happens.Have not read thru entire book, but what I've read so far is what I somewhat expected."
3,It's an ok book,Bought this book to use with my youth group for bible quiz. It would work great if you were quizzing them on an entire chapter or book at one time but to just pull a question out it doesn't work that well for how some of the questions are worded.
5,Bible Trivia,"4000 Questions and Answers on the Bible was use in a Bible Trivia Game with five persons. I was surprised to see those we assume know the Bible are limited in their knowledge. It has helped to get members of our church to participate more in Bible Study and Sunday School. We don't want Fans but Followers of the Word. The book was sent new, but with the intentional use for a long while, it will wear well."
3,Get the glue ready!,"I bought this puzzle for my 2.5 yr old, who loves puzzles. After doing it once together she could do it ""all by myself"". Unfortunately, ever since that first time the picture side has been peeling off many of the pieces and I have had to get the glue out. We have other puzzles passed down from friends and family which have seen many years of wear. I would not recommend this for that reason."
5,Oldie but Goodie,"This is a very old book with yellow pages, but there are no marks. I feel like I'm reading an antique."
5,Great undiscovered Band- Austin Fans Unite!!!,"This is one of the best CD's of all times. Bonecrusher is the best song I've ever heard. I love this CD. This group is an Austin Tradition. Wiggin' is another ""don't miss"" song. This is one CD I would recommend to everyone. These lyrics are great, the rythem is awesome, and the sound is superb. AAA+."
4,Great puzzles,"My son is still to young for this but he as been mesmerized by the younger versions from djeco, so hold great hopes for this one."
1,Unreadable. That was English?,"Unreadable. Simply unreadable.I get that it's set in a dystopian future, but to write ALL the dialog like ""Eye wuz gon tu th stor"" is painful, to put it mildly. I couldn't stop thinking about that old comic strip ""Tumbleweeds"" and how the Indian tribe ""spoke"" like that!I somehow managed to get thru the first short chapter, and skimmed ahead a bit, checking a few spots to see if it got any better. Sadly, no.I just couldn't read it. So I returned it. It could be one hell of a book for all I know. It could also be utter trash. Either way, I wasn't going to punish myself by forcing me to read it."
1,Can't finish it,"I am a fan of post apocalyptic fiction. I first purchased this book back in '08. Tried to read it, couldn't get into it, put it down for a couple months. Tried again, put it down for a couple years. Picked it back up, tried really hard one more time, made it a little over half-way...putting it down for good. I got to where I could read a page of the language without having to work too hard, but realized the story was really dragging and going nowhere. No real character development to speak of. I'm sayin' it's almost like it's all gimmick no substance, and the book tries to stand on the weight of its own uniqueness, but fails. Is it too much to ask for a great story after having to labor through the gibberish narrative?"
1,Non-traditional,intrigued by title. no expectations. none satisfied even for curiosity factor. a total waste of time and money. apparently I'm totally out of step with this kind of literature.
1,Unbearable.,"Russell Hoban, Riddley Walker (Summit, 1980)I have heard Riddley Walker praised as a classic in the making many times. I finally got my hands on a copy and gave it a try, and for all I know, those who call it such are correct. I couldn't tell. Hoban buys completely into the idea of creating a dialect that is only vaguely resembling English, and worse, he has his narrator use it for the whole novel. I'm sure there are those out there who became quickly fluent in it and could read this at the same speed they read any other novel, but I am incapable of such things. Every page took me at least ten minutes to get through. The end result is that the book is frustrating, incoherent, and ultimately unreadable. Not one to pick up if you don't like spending a long, long time poring over material; if you do, you'd be better off reading incomprehensible literary criticism. At least it passes for English. (zero)"
4,Fascinating mutated English; unengaging story,"What I liked: Hoban has created a believable future form of British English for this post-apocalyptic story, narrated by Riddley Walker, who has just become a man at the age of twelve. I thought it might get tiresome to read an entire book in this mutated English, but after only a page or two, I was into it, and I enjoyed the language all the way through. (Try reading it aloud when you having trouble making sense of it.)What I didn't like: I got bored about halfway through. I expected a gradual uncovering of interesting details of England's history from our time through Riddley Walker's time--when the culture of ""Inland"" is non-industrial and mostly illiterate, with packs of wild dogs everywhere--but you don't learn much more than can be inferred early on. Or else I expected Hoban to do more with one of the issues he plays with, like how a culture's stories evolve or the value of moving forward even when what's ahead is troublesome."
4,Remarkable,"Many years after reading ""Riddley Walker,"" what has stayed with me was Lissener's story ""The Other Voyce Owl of the Worl."" I can still recall nearly every word after reading it only once over 20 years ago."
5,The poetic language of the post-apocalypse future!,"Sharna pax and get the polewhen the Ardship of Cambrycomes out of his hole!It's Riddley, roading out...."
1,Kind of a disappointment considering the other reviews about it.,"This book is supposed to be what a post nuclear Briton is like after a couple hundred years. I couldn't really get into it. The author decided to go with the premise that the English language would changed dramatically. It's kind of like how Clockwork Orange is where there are lots of terms that are made up that are supposed to mean something. Some people get into that kind of thing, I just couldn't. That kind of makes or breaks the book, so if you didn't like Clockwork Orange for that reason, don't buy it."
2,You love or you hate it!,"I have a keen interest in apocalyptic fiction, so when the subject came up with a friend last year, he mentioned RIDDLEY WALKER, insisting that I would love it. He warned me about the broken English the author used to convey the first person tale of the hero in a world nearly reverted to the stone age. Intrigued, I looked it up and saw all the glowing reviews. It seemed to be all that my friend said it was. I ordered a copy and was actually looking forward to the experience. Alas, after getting about two thirds of the way through this novel (and that was a slog, I assure you!) I finally closed the covers and gave up. I see how much work was put into the novel, I get how this novel could attain a cult status; however, as with nearly all things ""cultish"", you either love it or hate it. RIDDLEY WALKER turned out to be the first book I gave up on in years."
4,"post-apocalyptic, coming-of-age roadmovie","""Riddley Walker"" is a post-apocalyptic roadmovie telling the story of its eponymous hero intertwined with the legend of St.Eustace and a bow to Punch & Judy. This unlikely combination serves as the backdrop to a coming-of-age story written entirely in phonetic slang with a healthy helping of dialect based on guesswork as to what terminology might survive.Getting used to Riddley's language takes some effort, but is well worth it, as his observations on society and long-forgotten history unfold.The Riddley Walker Annotations Web Site (...) is warmly recommended for additional information and insights."
2,Can't get by the artificial dialect,"Usually tolerant of lingo in dialogue/narrative, I found this author's first-person dialect exhausting after a few pages. Not sure I will pick this back up. While I am far from a ""lazy"" reader, the technique was interfering with my interest in following the charachter or the developing plot."
2,to hard to understand,"I wanted to like this book, but I didn't want to learn a new language in order to understand it."
3,Life is too short.,I admired the writer's creativity but because of his invented language it takes a long time to read. That can be viewed as a positive but my view was that life is too short to plow through Riddley speak. Was the story worth the trouble? I think if it didn't have the cute and gimmicky language it would be a just a simplistic post apocalyptic tale. The various character's actions were not well explained nor their motivations.
2,Not For Me,"I'm sure this is a good book, judging by the positive reviews. However, I cannot get past the use of non-standard English throughout. It's like trying to read school papers by kids with severe language deficits. I've done that. I just don't like the technique and found it too irritating to read more than the first chapter or so. So, for those who feel similarly, be forewarned."
1,Poor quailty product,"Purchased on line and read the company specs but when the product arrived it did not perform the way it was advertised. The scroll saw advertisement stated that it would handle both straight and pin type blades. When the product arrived, the instruction booklet stated that it would use only pin type blades. .The quality of the machine was poor. The plastic knob fell off during shipping. I sent the machine back immediately."
1,P-U,"No need to listen to this one. Just by looking at the tracks that are listed, I can tell it's a stinker!!!"
4,Interesting and entertaining,"It seems to be David Crystal's trademark, books that are both academic, full of information, and fun to read. This book is not an exception. Highly recommended."
5,no complaints,The book came in great condition and took about a week (more or less) to arrive. Good job.
3,The Two Magic Questions is good learning,"Big Al's books are big letter, easy to read and little over 100 pages. They are specifically designed to initiate and motivate creative thinking in new distributors trying to get their new Network Marketing business off the ground. They are decent for that purpose. Though I have some of Al's conference tapes that are just priceless, I consider these books ""average"". That said, there is always ONE chapter that has a gem of information in it. That's always worth the small price for the book. The Two Magic Questions have become my main means of qualifying my prospects to see if they might be a good fit for my business."
4,Pulsar 2001 replacement power cell,"After a great deal of searching, I finally settled on the Seiko 3023-5MZ. Although it wasn't a specific replacement for the Pulsar 2001 Solar watch (made by Seiko), I stripped it down and installed it with the original plastic holder and it has been working just fine ever since.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006FKJU0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,Not Genuine Seiko Parts,"The parts for this is not genuine. It included the battery which was a panasonic (believe it should of been a Maxwell by Seiko terms). It is compatiable to use for the Seiko watches and the red battery insulation piece was included. IT DID NOT INCLUDE THE METAL BRACKET THAT GOES AROUND THE BATTERY that should of come with this ""kit"". Every site says it is a good idea to use the new bracket when replacing the battery cell and using this kit. The bag the parts came in was obviously made to look like a Seiko bag but was just a copy of an original label. Disappointed Amazon would deal with this. My new battery appears to be working after installing it. Time will tell if it lasts. I would not recommend this seller due to false advertising. Try [...] instead."
2,Question about new capacitor,"Has anyone had one of these capacitors that would not recharge?When I replaced it (end of February, 2012) it would show a full ""30-minutes"" of charge.After about 4 days it dropped to a 20-minute reading.It stayed that way until this weekend (Apr 28) when it dropped to a 10-minute reading.No amount of shaking, moving, etc. builds up the charge. I can hear the parts moving like it always did but it just makes no difference.Any ideas on what I might done wrong?Seiko Kinetic Capacitor 3023-5MZ"
2,"Nice pictures, but almost no content","I bought this book along with a few other guide books for a trip to Greece. This was certainly not worth the money. It has very nice colorful pictures, but almost no content. I would not waste my money on it."
4,hair paint,"Worked great; we created a white stripe of hair for a skunk costume. Product is stinky, and will flake off after a bit. Plan on washing hair at the end of the day."
3,too fragrant,this is great for the apperence factor but has a fragrant odor and clashed with my perfume scent gave me a headache
1,NOT IMPRESSED,"This was overall TOO RUNNY. Even after multiple shakes, it had a blast of clear, runny, liquid and a FEW sparkles. I definitely wasn't impressed."
2,Not very happy with this set,"I have another Henckels knife set which is still in great condition after 4 years. But the blades of these two pieces are thinner and the handles not as sturdy. I used the board for small jobs like cutting fruits etc. Within a month, there appears to be a crack in the middle where the different pieces of wood meet."
1,not good,"After less than 5 months, the cutting board is falling apart at the seams. The wood is separating at the seams. The knives are nice though."
3,Small but sharp,Smaller than I thought (size of a pocket book) but the knives are sharp and sturdy. They're only good for travelling light or camping outdoors.
3,cherry stoner,"Well I bought this thinking for my first stoner it would be a good start. It works ok, as long as the stones aren't too large. The problem being the hole is pretty small, I don't see how you could pit an olive like a Kalamata. Another issue is the latch, after a few cherries the latch seems to fall down and you can't operate it. It didn't bother me too much since I don't plan on stoning cherries a whole lot but if you have a lot to do at once it can really slow you up. Other than that its pretty easy to use and the cup is nice to catch the stones, it holds quite a few of them. Oh and its dishwasher safe which I love."
2,I could've bought 2 boosters instead :(,"I was itching for a nice, short samurai fantasy, so I picked this up. I play the CCG/TCG regularly and am familiar with the characters presented in these novels from the recent expansion set, however I was fairly disappointed with this novel.In general, many of the named characters come in to serve as cameos and are given little to no character development. Even the main characters interact with dry dialogue which fails to break away from the author's voice.As a franchise novel, it does fine. It introduces the world of Kamigawa to the players and makes Toshiro Umezawa more than a 2/2 bushido'er w/ some fine looking card art.Fun for Magic players, but avid readers might want to look elsewhere, although the samurai fantasy genre tends to be a little hard to come by sometimes..."
4,It's a good read.,"This is probably my third or fourth book by McGough. He's written better stuff, but this one is still a good read. I loved the twists and turns at the very of end of the book."
4,not bad for 6.99 i guess,"Set in the story rich world of Kamigawa, in fact one of the most story driven worlds for Magic:the gathering in a number of years, this book drives from its rich backing to produce an interesting, albeit somewhat predictable story.The story of a princess out to discover why her country is beset by vengeful spirits (kami) she meets a rogue user of black magic who together must discover the secret behind the kami war that has beset kamigawa for 20 years.Compared to earlier M:TG books (such as the mirrodin block ones) this is a huge improvement. Though one wonders if they bother to edit the books at all as i found no less then 4 painfully simple grammar mistakes (typos even) in the course of my reading.Still, its a must read for Magic: THe Gathering fans. Though anyone not interested in the card game can still get a lot out of the book there are many better things to read."
4,A French geneticist in the court of Solomon,"A reporter who witnessed Jerome Lejuene's testimony reported that she felt as if she'd been in the presence of one of the Apostles. Rarely have brilliance and humility been so perfectly matched. Lejuene, who discovered the cause of Down Syndrome, traveled on his own initiative and at his own expense from Paris to a small town in Maryland to testify in the Davis frozen embryo case. ""Love is the opposite of chilly,"" he muses, and the proper place for the youngest human beings is in the womb, ""not in the fridge."" Laced with his gentle good humor, and packed with mind-boggling information, The Concentration Can is a fascinating read."
5,Best in Pro-Life,"Mostly a transcript of a real court trial, Concentration Can, gives scientific evidence of life before birth. Dr. Jerome Lejeune, a French geneticist, was asked to present professional evidence that frozen embryos are legitimate human beings. In the cross examination, Dr. Lejeune shows, even with some humor, that the embryo is nothing but human. It is not an animal or anything else. At the moment of conception the DNA has all that's needed to develop into a separate and distinct human being. Nothing else is added; cells only divide and delegate. The court drama is real and exciting, but the conclusion is unexpected. I assert that this is the best pro-life book written because of its medical and scientific approach. My only regret is that the book is out of print and can only be found in used bookstores."
4,True Science,Lejeune was a scientist who discovered the chromosomal cause of Down's Syndrome and many other things. After working in the US and his native France he won many awards in both. He became director of the Pasteur Institute in France. My only criticism of the book is that its major point would have been made more clearly if the book had been written in a straightforward manner rather than in a transcript of court testimoney with supporting documents.
2,I spent $8,"First off, I'd have to agree with the other reviewer-- the art is really good. But the writing is TERRIBLE.The English is choppy and doesn't agree in number and gender; it would be safe to say it wasn't proofread and/or was written by someone whose native language was not English.Sadly, that took away enough from the book. If I pick this small manga up again, it'll only be to look at some highly screen-toned pictures."
4,Excellent History of Conservation,Purchased for a management class on western resources. The readings are actually worthwhile and enjoyable. Gives excellent background of hunting and conservation.
4,Work on my powerbook...,"These are the only dvd-r's I've been able to get working on my powerbook (1.33Ghz aluminum).I would love to find some cheaper ones, but these do a pretty reliable job. I'd rate them higher if they weren't so expensive."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Check other reviews for Sony DVD-R's, this product is defective! They won't work in a traditional dvd player and they are cheaply manufactured. Out of 55 reviews for the 50/100 disc spool for this product, 22 people give it 1 star! BUYER BEWARE, this is a defective product that should not be allowed on the market. It is non-refundable and the Sony warranty requires you to mail back in order to receive the SAME DEFECTIVE PRODUCT that you purchased before."
1,Don't Work in my Samsung R120 Recorder,"I tried using these disks on my Samsung R-120 disc player/recorder. They play OK for the first 2/3 of the disk and then fail for the last hour or so of the recording. Very annoying! I thought at first it was the fault of my recorder, but the failure happens consistently at the same area of the disk time after time. I believe all 25 disks are defective. My next purchase of disks will be a brand that is specifically recommended by Samsung."
3,Great...if you're heading to San Francisco,I was looking for more information about Silicon Valley towns -- San Francisco was treated with so much detail (in terms of breaking down the neighborhoods and really detailing things to do in the city) it wasn't funny. Silicon Valley towns seemed to have just basic demographic information (and I only wish the rent prices quoted were that low today!)
2,A Great Incomplete Reference,"If you are single and you are looking for a job and an apartment in San Fran. or San Jose area this book is great for you. If you are married and own a home and you are thinking about moving to the area, this book is a little value. Spend 5 minutes reviewing it in the store and don't buy it.Did not cover the east bay at all. Did not give any helpful information about the real estate market. Did not list churches in the area."
3,"Good Book, but go for something post 2008 for a more realistic picture","This was a good book, very informative. Nothing against the author; I'm sure this information was very accurate for the time it was written. But if you're honestly considering relocating to the SFB area, I would say try to find something post 2008. The economic situation has changed alot about the area, and this is something you should know going in, especially if you're considering the expense of a move."
2,LOOK ELSEWHERE,"Until its last 15 minutes, ELSEWHERE is hopelessly dull. Its warning of Internet dating is flat and powerless and the culprit's identity is fairly obvious.It's amazing that Anna Kendrick would find herself an Oscar nominee 3 years later. Jon Gries (THE PRETENDER) tries hard but the script buries him. Paul Wesley and Tanya Ramonde don't have much screen time and one of GEICO's cavemen plays the slimy cop!Ultimately a disappointment."
1,Someone tell J. Lo to shut up.....,"That's all this silly women talks about is herself. SO WHAT. She has no heart and soul in her music and zero personality, In fact she sounds like she thinks she is queen of music and films in this marketing reel, That;'s all it is, to market J.Lo, it would be better to market suger powdered cereal."
4,Poor video for TV appearances,This dvd overall is awesome. The sound is fantastic ! The only bad thing is the poor video for TV appearances (except for VH1) The video quality was really bad and I can't understand why it is so bad. Worse than regular video quality with lots of pixellations.
2,HEY J. LO - where's the boot-tay?,"When I first saw this dvd...I couldn't wait to see it because it had one of my favorite j. lo performances on it: ""if you had my love (1999 blockbuster performance)"". That was until I actually saw it after I bought it...IT'S HORRIBLE!!! The quality is sooooo shody (whoever did the transfer needs to get fired). Then, to top it off, the ""waiting for tonight (1999 billboard awards performance) IS EVEN WORSE!!! AAARRRGHHH. It looks like a blurry videotape copy.I hear J. Lo's a perfectionist but this dvd is anything but. In this day in age where even old movies are looking crisp and clean, there is absolutely NO EXCUSE why J. Lo's camp could not deliver a quality dvd, it's a shame!"
1,BORING,"All the time the same song 'if you had my love...."" and goes over and over and over.I bought this dvd thinking that it was the one with the dancing performance (i think that's the 'let's get loud' dvd) and this one sucks.pretty boring."
5,A Magical Journey!!,"Truly a magical journey into the life of Krishna. A vivid and colourful recounting of the battle of Kurukshetra, Arjuna's moral crisis and the life of Krishna the ""Blue God"".The artful format, from the life of Krishna to the battlefield and back flows beautifully and makes ita treat for any reader, Eastern or Western, buy this book! give it away and buy it again!"
4,12 inch figure of Samuel L. Jackson...need I say more!!!,"One of the joys of the Star Wars action figures from the past few years is that it has given all of us an opportunity to have Samuel L. Jackson toys, and this is a nice one. It is intricately detailed, accurate, and the removable lightsaber is a nice touch. Unlike a lot of the 12 inch action figures you can acheive an exciting pose without much effort. I only have two complaints--I wish it came with a removable Jedi cloak, and the expression on the face looks like poor Mace is suffering from excruciating gas pain. However, overall, it is an excellent addition to any geeks...er....Star Wars fan's collection."
2,Exclusive Falls Short for Detail,"How disappointing as a collectior on the detail of this figure. Painted teeth look horrible. The AOTC non-exclusive figures have more to offer. The first 12"" release of this figure was much better as it included more. This one was just a re-hash of the old. Don't waste your money. This Mace has become a store credit."
4,"Great VaR book, lacking in Risk Budgeting","Prof. Pearson has done an excellent job describing VaR and how downside risk fits into the portfolio selection process. His book is the only book on VaR that I am aware of to provide a rigorous treatment of methods for encorporating non-normality of returns into the VaR estimate (by means of the Cornish-Fisher approximation or other approaches), surpassing even Jorion's ""Value-at-Risk"" in this regard. The treatment of Risk Busdgeting starts with a reasonable definition, but then drops to short references throughout the book and a brief treatment at the end about including VaR measures in a risk budgeting portfolio management approach. I would also liked to have seen the code used to create the examples published with the book, even though this is not a book on implementation."
1,Pésima compra,"Sí les interesa comprar Bandanas, no lo hagan con este proveedor. Enivaron una totalmente diferente a la de la imagen, con la misma referencia de esta. Además, el pago que uno realiza, es con todos los costos puesto, en mi caso, en Bogotá, Colombia, y pues nó, me toco cancelar adicionalmente $ 36.000 por el envío por FedEx. Es la peor compra que he realizado por Amazon, y me queda claro, que si no lo vende directamente Amazon, no se debe confiar, así esté ofrecido por la página."
5,Best Ever,"I lost one of the earrings so i purchased another set. I have 4 piercings on my ear and these look elegant, can be worn as zircon or gold studs, and have remained securely on my ear for 3 years now."
2,Cool baby daddy poetry--where are the blood and guts?,"The poetry is clean, no doubt, and the poet is talented, but I couldn't help but ask the question, ""Who cares?"" When it was light, it was ticklish and not moving, and I never found it dark. Slick, yes--the book was slick, too slick. It must've been a slow year for the Bakeless Prize, for this manuscript to have won it. It seems that, if the author were to focus on the depth of his humor, and on the depth of his ""intellectual statement,"" future efforts might exceed this one considerably--for, again, I repeat that he IS talented. Right now, though, he is irrelevant."
5,I keep this book on the shelf next to my bed,"because I like to return to it, revisit scenes and images. I love this book, the way it feels like a movie you want to watch over and over and over. But also like a car wreck: you can't look for too long or it starts to really tear at you. There's so much here."
1,Experimental -- NOT!,"I read somewhere: OOOH, experimental poetry, M Loncar. So I got the book. Experimental -- NOT! It's just a bunch of average language spread out on the page. One reviewer said, in effect, ""The author's use of space resembles the broad spaces of the American landscape."" Are you kidding me? Do people actually think and believe those kinds of things? Do youselves a favor and check out the REAL innovators these days: Writers like Lisa Jarnot, Lee Ann Brown, Anselm Berrigan, Tom Devaney, Rod Smith, Mark McMorris, Juliana Spahr, Chris Stroffolino, etc. This book merely pretends to be experimental. I bet the author doesn't really even know any experimental writers."
3,"Good in some parts, boring in others","I have to admit I mostly had Al Capone in mind when I bought this book. It was a good read, but a lot of the first two chapters are pretty boring, they were basically an in depth history of Chicago's beginnings. However, the further along I read the more I began to enjoy it, I only wish Asbury would have talked a little more about Chicago's most notorious gangster, Al Capone."
2,"Pretty dry, heavy on listing","Like many history books, Gangs of Chicago tends to list out factual data while ignoring a compelling narative. There are many colorful names and notorious characters in Chicago's past, but they are presented here in outline form. This book was originally published in 1940, so it predates a lot of criminal activity suggested by its title. After all of these years, it would also have been nice to have more photos and exhiits to flash out some dry reading."
5,It's like old-time radio stories before TV came along...,"Picture you and your family cuddled up on the couch, listening intently to a great story, with beautifully orchestrated music. Each of you is conjuring your own images in your mind of the characters, the settings, how it all looks and feels. My 6 and 4 year old kids were captivated--no, actually transported--listening to this CD. My friend popped it into her car player with her 8 year old son and his two friends, and they were silent the whole way to Hebrew school. Another friend's 8 year old daughter needed some quiet solitude after a hard day at school, and this was just the thing. We all highly recommend it! Mom and Dad won't tire of listening either. Plus the added benefit that they say it develops the brain!"
3,A 60%,I thought the movie had good action in parts of it. overall I'd say on a 1-10 scale I'd give it a 6. I thought in kinda dragged on slow. overall it was pretty good. I'd recommend it for 8-12 years of age because it's really more of a kid movie.
2,Nancy goes to Camp,"I have watched most of the Nancy Drew material on both film & T/V, from Bonita Granville to Pamela Sue Martin & beyond. In many respects this latest big screen offering was the worst of all!There wasn't much wrong with the actual story, if it had been played straight, but it was the treatment that was excruciatingly wrong. Instead of the usual plucky youngster, we were given a camped-up Wunderkid who could do no wrong.Such a pity, because it could have been so good, and this version might just spoil it for others. Todays teenagers deserve much better than this!"
5,great!,i bought this gift for a little girl that i know. i will be very happy when she sees it tonight. it came in mint condition and the DVD was in tip top shape.
5,Great Adaptation,This was an awesome movie updating Nancy Drew but not taking the wholesomeness out at all! An excellent family movie that was very well done!
4,My 8-yr-old watched this movie DOZENS of times in the first week we owned it!,My 8-yr-old recently discovered Nancy Drew and loves her! She's a bit too young to fully comprehend the book series (she has no trouble reading the books but doesn't yet completely grasp the big picture of what she's reading) so we recently rented (and then purchased) the Nancy Drew movie. The outcome? She LOVED it. Literally watched it a dozen times in the first week we got it! Nice family fun movie! You can read some of the other reviews for details on the characters but all in all even I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would! Highly recommended.
5,AWESOME MOVIE!,"This movie was great! I think it's a great movie for people of all ages, and genders to enjoy. Nancy's character followed close to that of in the books. I thought she kind of treated Ned like crap in the movie...but otherwise, it was great!! :)"
4,One of the best remakes yet!,"I have a seven year old with a vivid imagination (she got scared watchingThe Veggie Tales /Pirates Who Don't Do Anything and Me! (Big Idea Books / VeggieTales)) so I was a little leery letting her watch this one. I was relieved and delighted to find Nancy Drew had just enough excitement that, although she was scared, Ashley made it through.Nancy Drew gives the young a hero who is neither rude or overly sensual. Nancy is a spunky teen that sticks to her unique style, despite peer pressure to conform. The romance is perfect for little girls, complete with a kiss at the end of the show.I recommend this movie kids of all ages. It is a breath of fresh air despite the age of the original conception."
2,You have to make a choice,"When you're making a movie about a nostalgic subject, you have to make a choice: Either make a parody, poking fun at the original (as the Brady Bunch movies did), or try to be faithful, at least in spirit, to the original concept. You can't take a middle road.Yet that's what the makers of this movie tried to do. Nancy was sarcastically portrayed -- for laughs-- as a ""little Miss Perfect"" (which was not true to the original stories), and at the same time shown as the bright, spunky crime-solver. The combining of these two approaches mixed together about as well as oil and water.This movie tried to have it both ways. And failed."
4,True Nancy Drew,A delightful family movie. Also this single DVD lets you view the movie in either widescreen or full screen format.
4,Good Clean Movie,Really enjoyed the plot. It goes along with the Nancy Drew Didj game. It was a very family oriented movie--kudos to the movie studio! I hope to see more Nancy Drew movies in the future.
4,Fun!,This movie is great for the whole family - regardless of age. Keeps up the suspense right up to the end. Great humor and really nails the Nancy Drew from the books I read as a kid.
1,Nancy Drew (2007) Review,"Nancy Drew (2007) ReviewPlot: Nancy and her father are going to Hollywood for Carson Drew's work. I disliked this movie, the plot is suspossed to be for kids, but I wish they could've had a little more tennager like.Characters: Besides, Carson, Bess, George, and Ned, there are no another characters from the series of books, They add new characters which were very strange, but I was hoping for the characters we grew up with to be in this movie. :(Nancy's New Look: I'm soory, but I think Emma Roberts was a bad choice for Nancy, she looks nothing like her, and they didn't keep Nancy's character the same. Nancy is suspossed to be titian colored haired teen, not a brown colored. Besides, Nancy is way too perfect in this movie, how are girls going to relate to Nancy if she's too cutsy, and pefect?Overall, I didn't like this movie at all, it's bad! :((Aubrey's Rating System)0/5I hope some company will make a true Nancy Drew movie for us fans.Thanks for reading! :)"
3,Entertaining...but not true to originial character,"I enjoyed the movie very much, but was disapointed in the departure from the book series characters. Nancy and Ned were not high school teenagers and Mr. Drew was not a struggling attorney hoping for a better job. There were definite moments of recognizing the 'real' sleuthing of Nancy Drew however, and is a nice one to watch with my daughter - who is 4 - and is now captivated with Nancy Drew!"
3,fun adventure of sleuthing,"Nancy has relocated to Los Angeles because her father has accepted an assignment there. Promising her father not to do any more sleuthing, Nancy tries to fit in at a nearby high school. However, Nancy is on a different wavelength than with the rest of the students there. She's deemed old fashioned and behind on time, despite her courteous manners.Meanwhile, while staying at an old mansion, circumstances involving a dead actress, Dehlia Draycott, and a hidden will tempts Nancy into sleuthing. Pretty soon, she discovers herself and new friends in midst of dangers...all behind her father's back.I found *Nancy Drew* to be an enjoyable film even though I found some parts to be a bit cheesy. Nonetheless, it's a good ol' dose of fun to watch."
3,Fun trip down nostalgic lane,"As a child I was a bib fan of the books and wanted for nostalgia purposes to give this movie a shot. I went into it with no expectations what-so-ever. Consequently I found it a fun romp down memory lane. The movie is almost a farcical look at today's youth. Nancy, as a character, has not changed much. She is intelligent and forthright. The world she finds herself has changed. She a blast from the past to the people in LA and as far as her peers go, an unwelcome one. The movie, just as Nancy, doesn't take itself too seriously and that is what makes it enjoyable. You can chuckle and laugh at the predicaments without feeling you are making fun of the movie, which is what I figured I would probably end up doing in order to enjoy myself. Carolyn Keene, whoever she really is, would have been proud to be linked to this movie."
1,Most stupid movie released this year.....,"Cmon, as a kids movie, it barely passes as a short infomerical for the CW network. It has no script, no compelling characters, no acting, no direction to go, hardly any noticeable production values at all, it looks and sounds more like a failed TV pilot rather then a film.Emma Roberts acts like an idiot (in keeping with the dumb roles she has played so far) and her cast members look totally clueless in the roles.If you ever wanted evidence that Warner Brothers does not care about TV or movie, and only wants to make money, Here it is."
5,fun movie for all,"I'm not the harsh critic that others are here. I saw this movie at the theater with my adult sister, adult daughter, and young neice & nephew. All of us enjoyed the it. Beforehand, I wasn't sure about Emma Roberts as an actor, but she did a good job.There's just is not enough family-type movies (non-animated), to go see these days. That's why I gave this one a 5-star rating. It was fun to see a haunted house and the variety of locations used. A lot of adventure and ingenuity with Nancy. Interesting characters and good dialogue. I like to see articulate, clever dialogue (does not stoop to swearing & vulgarity to get our attention), as in classic, older movies.I plan to buy this Nancy Drew 2007 movie on DVD. And will probabaly see the sequel, too."
4,great product,"threads are well formed the hose barbs are well done and the finish is very nice, the only reason for four stars is that they are a little pricey"
5,ATaste of Paquito Rivera,"One of my Latin Favorites, he is smokin on this earlier DVD . There are several Tunes on this disk that are stand outs. Especially my favorite JUST KIDDING, and Ignaccio Berroia Killer, great chops.Being a Drummer I recommend this disk for all you cats putting your Latin thing Together, 6/4 it,s smokin."
4,Not for the timid!,"One of the best works by Guy Maddin. Extremely bizarre and surreal but more accessible than some of his other works. In the same league as ""Une Chien Andalou""."
2,don't believe the hype. OVERRATED,"after reading many reviews on this so called masterpiece of surreal cinema I finally gave in to purchasing this DVD. comparisons to such geniuses such as Murnau, Cocteau, Bunuel, and Lynch which are repeatedly made to Maddin are idiotic. no offense to him but Tales from.. is in no way comparable to Eraserhead or Blood of a Poet. Tales from the Gimli Hospital is not a horrible film but it's not what people have hailed it to be. maybe I'm missing something that everyone else isn't. there are signs of a talented filmmaker none the less and his later work has proven that. that doesn't help the dullness of the story and the horrific acting that could only be compared as .......-like. anyway, judge for yourself. but don't be fulled by statements such as: ""this is a must"", because it isn't. just because something is filmed in black and white and vintage techniques are thrown in does not make it a digestable surrealist piece."
5,extra good film,"One has to know icelandic folklore, to be able to begin to appreciate this ingenious film.the best Icelandic film ever!"
2,Too bad...,"I was disappointed by this film. It sounded like something that I would really like. I was kind of intrigued at the beginning and I watched carefully throughout the whole thing but, for me, it just never came together to be anything moving. I mean, I think I understood the artisitic statement he was trying to make, but it had no emotional effect on me. Just boring, like reading a text book, you know? A thinking man's movie. But I have to say, there were some really cool shots. But I guess it really felt a student film. A pretty good student film. But a student film, none the less. I don't know. Maybe I don't get it, but I didn't like it. And I usually like these oddball kinds of things."
1,why the hype?,"This is ham-fisted moviemaking at its worst--or should I say best? Burdened by an impossibly cheesy plot which fills the movie with more dead-air time than your next laundryroom round, the movie is at once too insultingly imcompetent to be a homage to the great German expressionist films which supposedly inspired it, and too boring and poker-faced to be a send-up of anything but the director's own mediocrity. Go see any film by Murnau, Pabst, Ruttmann, or Lang from the 20s--or for that matter any silent films at random, whether Russian, American, French, whatever--and they'll be infinitely better than this puerile endeavor at self-indulgence."
3,MAKES YOUR HMO LOOK GOOD,"...""TALES FROM THE GIMLI HOSPITAL"" is the black and white first film from Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin and it reflects the best of the great silent and surrealist directors like F.W. Murnau, Luis Bunuel and Jean Cocteau. Originally released in 1988, this 68 minute nightmare is set during a smallpox epidemic in the village of Gimli, Manitoba, at the beginning of the 20th century. Friends Emar and Gunnar are two male patients who share a hospital room as well as their darkest secrets. Disturbing tales of creeping pestilence, unconsummated passions, envy, necrophilia are told climaxing in a deadly battle between the former friends now rivals. Moody, weird and atmospheric, the Gimli universe has been embraced by the midnight movie circuit and set the director's career in motion. The disc includes a crisp full frame transfer, an impish director's commentary and two of his short films."
3,Cute little wierd tale,"I didnt like this one.The effort is good though, it is clear that Madin did his best... Maybe it should have worked... but for me it didnt.The picture is good, but the story is rather dull (even with the necrophilia thrown in) and... Well I really did not like the director sense of aesthetics.Dont get me wrong I LOVE and I mean LOVE german expresionism, but the way Maddin did this one... Yuck!I am giving it 3 stars because although I recognize this review is quite subjective, I acknowledge the production value and the dedication they put in this film... Nevertheless I did not liked it.(did I mention that I did not like this one?)If you like little wierd tales that kept themselves far, far away from your nerves you should buy this one, however. You will see it with a smile on your face."
3,Decent Remixes,"I've never been a huge fan of remixes, but this CD of remixes holds up fairly well. Highlights are the Propellerhead's mix and the extremely-long (but still good) Andy Ling's Aryan Vocal Mix. I didn't care for the two Alex Reece mixes. See if you can find it in a dollar bin somewhere."
2,"Great chips, poor quality control","Before I made this purchase, Terra Blues were my favorite potato chips in the world. They're substantial, thick, crispy, well-salted, and cool to look at. After making this purchase, they are still my favorite potato chips. I just wouldn't recommend a bulk purchase to anyone. While the chips are still delicious, the bags are often *extremely* under-filled - to the point that two bags have had under 5 chips in the bag (5 chips that certainly didn't add up to the advertised 1 oz bag size). I contacted Terra customer service and didn't get a response which was a bit disappointing.If you like potato chips, buy Terra Blues - they're great. Just don't buy them in bulk until and unless they improve their quality-control processes."
4,Blue Potato Chips,This is a very hard product to find in stores. I had to order it online. The taste is very good and the bags keep them crispy. I would recommend them to others because they are a good substitute for chips.
1,Chips are stale,"I just received these as a re-order. Although good in the past, this time they taste stale and not very crunchy. Very disappointed."
5,Best Chip Out There,This by far is the best tasting chip on the market. Has a very nice crunch and taste. Meaning a thick cut chip with just enough salt to make it my top choice for munching.
3,the quality is not consistent,"Initially I gave it 4 stars and the following review:Good tasty chips. They arrived fast and were packaged well. This portion seemed to be a little saltier than those that I used to buy although I actually like salt. Addictive, but I will buy again.However, in the most recent shipment the chips were not ""blue"" but almost black because they were burnt. Not only in one bag but in the whole batch."
5,LOVE THESE CHIPS,I LOVE THESE CHIPS AND THEY ARE SO MUCH HEALTHIER THAN REGULAR CHIPS AND THEY TASTE GREAT AND THEY LOOK UNIQUE.
3,...,"I love Terra brand chips... but the ""blue"" flavor tastes like chewing on uncooked frozen french fries."
4,A Little Better Packaging Would Help,"I just got my pendant and it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. However, I'd say that given the bouncing it must take during shipping, a better wrap would be nice. The pendant itself was fine but the chain, which is very very fine, came with a knot...very hard to remove."
5,Jen W,"My husband ordered this for my Christmas gift from our new infant daughter. I absolutely LOVE it!!!! The chain was a little thinner than I would have liked, but you know that when you buy a pendant like this, the chain is not what you are paying for. It is a beautiful piece that I look forward to passing on to my daughter when she has her first child! Shipping was also great. Only took about 2-3 days to come in. LOVE THIS PENDANT... it is absoultely georgeous!!"
3,Kind of Like Sprite With A Funky Aftertaste,"If you ask me, the bottle is the coolest part of this product. There's a marble at the top and you have to push it through, then the bottle narrows in to catch it. That was very cool, always fun to open. As for the drink itself, it tasted a bit like Sprite (which I'm not a big fan of), only it has a very pungent after-taste that tastes a bit like cough syrup. I don't know, just buy it for the bottle to see what I'm talking about and pour it out, haha."
5,Pleasingly satisfied.,This print arrived quickly and in great condition. The cost of shipping in relationship to the cost of the print were worth it. The print was professionally packed as one would expect. The colors are vibrant. A real bargain for a good quality print.
2,Ruined by an artsy ending,"I guess it was realistic and artsy to give depressing ending to ""Starter for Ten.""Good acting but the director was clearly in a split mind as to what kind of film he was making. The film starts with the promise of 'about a boy, but looses its way. The actor playing Bamber Gascoin must have been told it was a piss take. The ending is implausible and only serves to make the watcher feel a fool for watching beyond the boring start."
2,Disappointed,"I love James McAvoy, but I wish I could say this was a great movie. Although there were a few humorous scenes, the movie was, overall, disappointing. McAvoy did play the character well, but the storyline was my biggest issue. Watching this move made me feel more awkward and uncomfortable than I have in my entire life."
2,Not so great,"Even with Tom Hanks involved, this doesn't make the grade. A quiz-show caper, it lacks suspense. The love interests are only minorly interesting. The soundtrack of 80s Brit hits isn't bad, though. Watch if you're really bored."
3,Starter (or Non-Starter) for 10???,"Somewhat likable despite its formulaic portrayal of British university life, wanker!! Interesting sound-track crammed with good mid-80's tracks from British bands. Quiz show whiz learns that smarts are more than just knowing the right answer and that knowledge of trivia need not be confused with insight and good judgment.The quiz champ protagonist is torn romantically between the super-hot babe (a Christie Brinkley lookalike) or the unconventional but appealing Jewish chick ..Hmmm, which way will he choose? Tune in to see. I wonder ...Not a bad way to spend 96 minutes ..."
2,early James,"see James McAvoy earlier in his career. . . . he's wonderful, but I didn't buy the story line, pretty depressing ending. . . .unless you are determined to own all of his movies, I'd rent this one."
3,Not good enough to watch twice,"I like McAvoy. I was disappointed in this slow moving film, though I didn't think it was his fault. The idea was unoriginal, but the idea doesn't have to be original for the journey to be enjoyable. Unfortunately, in this case, the execution just made it drag, drag, drag. Found myself fidgeting a lot. :("
3,Seeing a Jew First Time,"A funny movie of the eighteen year old making his way from a working class-vanishing provincial suburb to Bristol Uni of the Tetchier epoch and his interaction with world outside native English suburbia, sexual encounters on a plate.Probably, this movie, darer for the Brits overlived an era of explicit lies still somehow dominating someone mythology of lazy dummies not willing to work as even slight possibilities of being taken on exist in a British Commonwealth anglosphere for mates privileged only, is still of an interest on various merits."
4,"""A Nerd As Charmer""","This is a slight film, but one well worth seeing for the fine performance by James McAvoy. A plain-looking nerd who goes off to college seeking to distinguish himself both as academically knowledgeable and, at the same time, as a ladies' man, he must strike a chord in the hearts of thousands of first year undergrads just like him. What McAvoy has going for him especially is his ability to ooze charm from every pore without being in the slightest degree sickeningly sweet. It is his memorable performance which distinguishes an otherwise pretty formulaic college comedy of heartbreak and eventual triumph."
4,"The book was great, the movie was good","Those of you who read the book may be a bit disappointed by its screen adaptation, an all to common occurrence when a book becomes a film.Placing that comment aside and reviewing this film without use of a pretense, Starter for 10 is a cute, all be it a bit campy, British comedy about the bumps and hiccups brought by coming of age, finding ones future, and facing ones past. James McAvoy does a brilliant job of making his character lovably awkward. The subtle comedy, satirical character types and romantic interfaces make this a must see for any University Challenge fan (or anyone looking for a good laugh).1 star off only because the book was better."
4,"SWEET, CHARMING OLD BLACK & WHITE FILM WITH THE LOVELY YOUNG JOAN CRAWFORD","This is a charming old Black & White film featuring the young and lovely Joan Crawford. It is of course not the very best visual/audio quality ~ because of its age ~ but is most heart warming, and Crawford gives a very sincere and sweet performance. How lovely and beautiful she was in the early years. A nice film for Joan Crawford fans. It will touch your heart."
3,not bad for what it is and what it cost,Bought this about 1 year ago. Never had a drill press before but I am not overly disappointed in it. Small drill press limits uses but for the average homeowner or small time woodworker it is sufficient. Assembly was a bit lengthy and changing belt grooves to change speed is a bit annoying but again you have to take in to account frequency of use and money spent and it balances itself. Installing chuck was a nightmare but it works good enough now. I'd probably go a little bigger next time and a electronic speed change vs belt.
3,Good item,A little hard to put the chuck in but all in all for some one just starting out in wood working it does what i wanted it to. Not bad for the price.
5,Harney and Sons teas loooove them,Excellent quality and flavor tea!!! all of Harney's and Sons are very good and always very high quality leaves... loooove themmm
4,Surprisingly Good Post-Grunge Rock.,"This band IS just as described in the other reviews. Take Maynard Keenan of Tool and place him as the lead singer of Staind, and you have a good approximation of Waking. Dark, Aggressive beats with a brooding yet melodic voice makes for some great tracks. Like the others, the only complaint I can voice is the lack of tracks, otherwise I would rate 5 stars. If you are a fan of the Tool / Staind sound you REALLY owe it to yourself to get this album."
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good cd, could use a few more songs, though. Very good overall, and i like the live song at end of cd. I recommend."
5,An outstanding and unique book,"It was sad for me to learn that this one book is now out-of-print. Back in 1990 when I bought it, it was the very first book to explain some of the most exciting subjects in theory of computation in a way that it is so clear and motivating. When I read it again, the same thoughts come back to my mind. This book is very well written. It is a shame that so many computer science students and researchers may now not have the opportunity to learn from it too."
3,"Nice Board, but Not Enough Peg Holes","Many games of Backgammon have more than 5 checkers on a point, but this game only has 5 peg holes for each point. It makes it difficult to play. Ide suggest finding a ""Manget Checker"" Backgammon to play while travelling in a car. If your not worried about checkers moving(while in a vehicle), try looking for a Travel Sized Backgammon set."
3,"For me, magnetic would have been better.","I could see this as being a great game board in a moving vehicle like a car or RV but for an airplane, I would rather have a magnetic one. It's a good board and very compact which is part of the problem, its too compact for my big hands."
3,average but not bad,"this EP includes three variations of one mix + a diff one. the first track is the catchiest and best of the bunch. it has a short intro but then goes into the main section, which is a good piano-riff-based house track that has most of the vocals from the original. the second track is slightly faster and features much of the same material but w/out most of the vocals, although it does include some vocal samples. the third track is similar to the 2nd track but w/ more of the original vocals. lastly, the fourth track is a diff mix entirely w/ some darker sections that really don't fit w/ the lighter, earlier erasure-sounding music in the rest of the track. all in all this EP's not high priority, but the first track at least is worth getting."
2,What is going on?,"Sure it is Erasure, but this CD maxi is one I should NOT have purchased, out of all the remixes etc... I really can't find one I really like. Who Knows the details, I suppose every group has something that is remixed, and turns out to be a flop, and this one is it, way to much experimeting with a different type of sound, far from the real Erasure feeling and up lifting beats. Not a great maxi. Jason Prof DJ"
5,Probably the last word on Browning.,"I especially enjoyed Prof. Berry's pithy musings about railroads and breastmilk, a connection many of us have long pondered but have never dared utter."
3,Intertextuality in theocritus,Les directions modernes des etudes surTheocrite 1-L'intertextualite 2-L'echo philosophique 3-Theocritus Botanist
3,This is not a masterpiece,"Donizetti a écrit une trentaine d'opéras. L'air du ténor, dans Marin Faliero, est redoutable. Il vient d'tre enregistré par le nouveau phénomène lyrique Juan Diego Florez. L'intrigue de cet opéra est indigeste, mais les chanteurs ont de bons moments et la distribution est remarquable. Dommage que la qualité de l'image (trop sombre) ne soit pas à la hauteur de la performance."
2,Tedious and Dated,"One of those farces where characters are constantly running from room to room barking out hyper-emotional dialogue. Scorsese introduces it praising it's vibrant use of colors and layered shot composition. Unfortunately, that's all there is. Three powerful men fall in love with a feisty actress, who only loves her career. It feels at least an hour longer than it really is."
5,great 1600mah batteries,these are excellent batteries and are indeed 1600mah. You will not find a better battery at any local store. Look carefully at the mah rating before you buy locally. These are worth the extra money for the quality! BUY THEM NOW!
2,Bzzz. Skip these batteries.,"These batteries are OK, but far from the best. You should be looking for 1600 mAH NiMH batteries, not these puny 1450s. Olympus makes top of the line NiMH batteries. Kodak also makes 1600 batteries.Skip these batteries... they won't last as long."
5,These batteries are 1600 mah,"I recieved these batteries yesterday and they are the 1600 mah battery. I have no experience with the battery yet, but based on the rating, I would say they are a good value for the price."
4,Alternate supplier of 1700 mAh NiMH batteries.,"I've been looking for NiMH batteries for my digital camera, and while these Kodak batteries look pretty good judging from the reviews, I've been able to find reasonably priced 1700 mAh AA Energizers with a 1 hr or 8 hour recharger (the good ones: microprocessor-controlled with thermal protection circuitry) stocked at [a local]. Doing some poking about on the Web also turned up some 1800 mAh NiMH batteries...."
1,WHERE can you actually get them (which Circuit City?),"Ref the Kodak 1850, Ive tried to enter every zip number I know but unable to locate a Circuit City that carries these batteries. Can anyone post any location in Florida where they might actually have them? Does Circuit City distribute nationally or is this a local yokel venture?The rating isnt really 1, Im sure the 1850's are ok, maybe my rating can be applied to Circuit City"
5,Digital Camera? You need these...,"Don't make the mistake of thinking that these rechargeable batteries are the same as all others; they're not. Want to know how to tell the difference? Click on the picture of the batteries above for enlargement, and look carefully at the right side of the batteries themselves - you'll see that these batteries are rated at 1450 mAh. What's that mean to you? Longer lasting. I've noticed that most rechargeable batteries are rated at 1200 mAh - only the Kodak and Olympus batteries are rated at 1450 mAh, and the Olympus batteries are more expensive.These batteries outlast the high-end Duracells in my digital camera by 4 to 5 times! True! I don't know why, but in my Nikon Coolpix 950, Duracells drain completely in about 30-40 minutes while these babies keep on going. I had mistakenly purchased a set of Ray-o-Vac rechargeable batteries, and these Kodak's put 'em to shame.This is the product to get. Don't waste your time looking at anything less..."
2,Get the other one,This one has the 1450 mAh rating. Do a search for Kodak NiMH and get the other set. They're cheaper and they're also the 1600 mAH.
5,Digital Camera batteries...that last!,"I have a Nikon990 digital camera...it gobbles alkaline batteries from fresh to dead in about 1 hour 25 minutes when using the LCD display. I bought some of these Kodak batteries, charged them up, and have been using the camera for at least 3 hours and the battery meter is at full charge still! If your digital camera takes AA size batteries, buy these. You will be extremely happy."
3,work alrite,They last long enuf and they work with my recharger for my olympus c-3000 digital camera. Works with most digital cams. Does not come with battery recharger
3,Didn't Perform Well For Me,"Not impressed.I used these for my digital camera (Casio QV-R40). With flash and LCD on I got an average of 24 pics before the battery ran out (once it was 27 - but that was only once).With the Sanyo batteries that came with the camera I was getting over 50 per charge (sometimes more)(also with the flash and lcd on)They are cheap though - and if you don't mind the inconvenience of re-charging they are a good ""deal""."
4,Good batteries.,I don't know how well this kind of battery should work. I use them in my Olympus D-360 camera. They seem to work well.
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed to find that the soundtrack did not include the last musical piece played in the movie. It was a hymn and I think the title was ""Deal Gently with Thy Servants, Lord"". That is the main reason I purchased this soundtrack. Does anyone know why it is not included?"
1,Good VB & ADO introduction. Poor for C++ developers,"While I've written both VB & C++ components, I must say that this book is written solely for VB programmers. In that context, the ADO coverage is good for beginners & reaches as far as paging, batch processing & disconnected recordsets albeit the coverage is light. From there on, the book runs dry with samples out of context & disconnected. Enter the C++ programmer & you are certain to lose interest rapidly. MTS & MSMQ coverage is a drudgery while parts II & III as they pertain to design & architecture are an endless toil. Am I alone in thinking that VB & enterprise should never be mentioned together due to the fact that they constitute an oxymoron?"
2,"Marginally useful book, Useful for beginners only","Helps in developing concepts about ADO, MTS, MSMQ and DNA in general. Lacks connectivity in examples. The source code that I downloaded from site lacks comments, which make it easy to get lost. Some of the examples don't even compile.I picked up this book with an expectation of finding a discussion (and examples) of applications that uses ADO with MTS and MSMQ all together -- I am disappointed. It talks about MSMQ only marginally.Builds concepts, gives solid reason of using certain techniques not covered anywhere else, but lacks effective code examples."
3,Good but not prime,"I bought this costume for my 4 year old. He loved it right away but within 3 minutes the styrofoam block used to hold the mask away from his eyes fell off, making the mask unwearable. I ""jimmied"" it as much as possible and was able to save the Halloween parade. I think they should make the mask bit more wearable without the need of glued on items."
3,The picture is midleading,I was disappointed with the quality of this costume. It isn't as durable and is much cheaper than the picture lets on. The mask looked nothing like Optimus and the nose piece and elastic band fell off when my daughter first tried it on. The costume itself had developed a big runner by the time we got home from trick-or-treating. But my girl was happy that she could be Optimus for halloween. The irony of the situation is that I ordered two separate items; the costume was sent expedited and the other regular delivery. I received my other item 2 days before this costume.
2,"kid's costume, Adult mask","We bought this for our 5 year old (size 4-6). It fit him perfectly. But the mask is way too large for a young boy and we could not get it to stay on his face nicely no matter how we tried. The mask fits my husband perfectly and he is a grown man weighing 200 pounds! My son is unable to wear it, even for a few minutes. Even with the Styrofoam piece in the mask, it falls down on his face and he can not see from the eye holes. The outfit part looks great but just doesn't work without the mask, we are returning it."
5,GREAT!,"I bought this one for my 3yr old. It was a little big but that was good. It was cold outside and i put his zipper pj's on underneath this costume . That did 2 things, kept him warm and bulked his costume up. He loved the outfit. He didnt like his mask. Mask is a little on cheaper side. I had to cut eyes bigger so he could see. The strap was a little stretchy like rubber band. I reccomend this costume. If you have trouble with mask, go to walmart in the optical center and get one of those $5 headband strechy things they put on glasses to hold on face. Just attach that to mask , That would be a comfortable and secure hold for mask."
2,Mask broke within minutes,"Kid opens birthday present, screams with joy--mask rips down the middle first time he attempts to put it on. Gift was a hit because this little boy is a big optimus prime fan, but the quality of this costume sucks."
2,Fell Apart,"Like other reviewers have said, the styrofoam block holding the mask off my son's face fell off immediately. Being a 5 year old, he wanted to wear it around the house a few times and the fabric frayed. By Halloween, it was in tatters."
2,Not much here for a how-to DVD,"This seems to be a basic how-to, with practically no assistance the the Nuvi's more advanced features. And THEN the last HALF of the DVD is about FISHING DVDs the company sells! This item should be provided for free. The Nuvi is an excellent GPS, so I'm still glad I bought it, but avoid this DVD.Garmin nüvi 680 4.3-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator"
4,performs as advertised,"performs as ad says, compatible with any valve types, well made, good price, would recommend to others."
5,Great choice,"I really like all the TOPEAK products, thay are excellent quallity and this is not an exceptionYou will appreciate all the extra features:The design as a regular size pumps makes it a very veratile pump for the road, the flexible hose makes it easy to pump without worrying about stressing the valve. It folds in a almost single tube and you can hang it to the bikes frame not worring about big parts.Very good performanceJust look for the right one, there is one with gauge and other plain, I made the mistake buying the plain one, but besides that I'm very happy with it."
3,Good enough,"I think I really meant to get the one with the built in gauge, but that was my mistake. First thing I have to say is that this really is not a suitable substitute for a floor pump. The foot feels flimsy and the hose is just barely long enough to reach the valve on my bike. However, once it was connected it was easy to pump and I got the tires up to the right pressure pretty quickly. The pump looks good and fits nicely on the frame of a road bike."
1,"Good concept, poor design","The concept of the pump is great, however it was poorly executed. Fold out foot pad would be a great option, but the length of the hose/tube won't reach my bike if you try and use the foot pad."
2,Very poor mounting hardware.,"To mount this pump, you need to either sacrifice a water bottle mount or put ty-raps around the bike frame."
2,Returned Bike Pump,"I had a Topeak Mini Morph Bike Pump that gave me fits because it was so tight that the schrader valve would push into the tire and not engage the pin so it could not pump up the tube. That one I took back to the store (it was probably a manufacturing defect). I bought a Topeak Peak DXII and it fits schrader valves much better.=================================================================================================================After reading other newer reviews, I'd guess that my problem with the too tight fit was just an exception - just a manufacturing defect."
2,No Support From Topeak,Check their website. There is NO WAY to contact them - something to consider before buying from them.
3,OK,As other reviews have mentioned pump air tube is too short - which makes it difficult for attaching and pumping tires.
5,Well worth the purchase.,"Initially, I was confused with this pump because I did not know that you have to -firmly- affix the pump to the tire valve. I was worried about breaking my valve -- because I'm a panicky type. But, this little baby does the job! As someone who relies solely on a bicycle for transportation, I needed something to carry with me at all times. This pump fits in my backpack without taking up too much space and it is Schrader and Presta compatible!It may bother some people that the little foot on the valve isn't a longer size, nor is it available on both sides of the pump but I don't mind that at all.(Also, for those who are curious: I have a Commuter bicycle from Jamis. It's a street bike, not a mountain bike.)I would recommend this!"
1,Snug Fleece,It was uncomfortable and not a complete sheep wool pad but rather rows of woolsewed to another fabric. It was not like the wool mattress pad I had before. I dothank the company for refunding our money without a hassle.
2,seems ok but delivery was horrible from Dream Soft Bedding,"Ordered this king size wool snug fleece mattress pad directly from Dream Soft because our mattress was too firm. The customer service is not great as their reps couldn't give me a straight answer as to when the pad was to arrive. Typical lazy women with the robotic script already written for them to read. The $388.00 pad arrived in 9 days from when the order was placed. I was never so disappointed. The product seems good so far. I'm worried about the ""vertical channeling"" that other folks reported. It sure was a lot of hard earned dollars and this better last. I should have ordered from Amazon instead. Avoid Dream Soft for direct purchases. Pathetic customer service with typical ""Sleepy's"" bedding criminal and lazy mentality."
5,Best wool mattress pad!,"This is the best wool mattress pad you can buy! A opposed to a mattress topper -- filled with wool that will need refilling after 3-5 years as the wool inside compresses - this one truly resists compression. We've had ours for six months now and I am always amazed at the fiber that still look as fluffy as the first day! You don't get this with other wool pads, not even with the other washable line that Snugfleece Woolens makes. (I had bought the crib size Imperial Snugleece for my daughter and while it is washable, it will not resist compression like the Original does)It is also easy to maintain: if you accidently spill liquid on your pad, it can very easily be spot cleanned with a wool product such as Kookaburra woolwash because wool resist water.Once you sleep on this, you will not want to do without!"
5,Heaven!!,"I purchased this in a queen for my mattress that was a bit hot. You do feel like you are sleeping in a cloud and it really helps regulate body temperature. I didn't notice any odor at all, but I did let it air outside, as the instructions state. I've had this on my bed for about a month now and am thrilled with my purchase. I highly recommend this!"
3,Underarmour Women's ColdGear,"I actually bought this for my wife. Now she thinks it's pretty good, but she's not jumping up and down excited. It does keep her warm and she likes that but she said that it made her itch a little bit in the beginning, but that is her getting used to the different type of material. Overall good product and I'll purchase again as I also have purchased the men's coldgear for myself. Oh and as far as delivery it was very fast. Love that part about amazon and the vendors connected to the site."
5,Perfect for indoor and outdoor exercise!,"I love the cold, and can not stand being too warm-so the cold gear line is perfect for me. I wear this indoors and outdoors, year-round and I have no complaints about being too warm or too cold ever. I am well blessed in the bust area, and the ""compression"" fit allows my to work out in the gym and not be too bouncy. A lot of people have said that these run small, I do not think that is the case. They stretch and compress-but they do tend to shrink if not washed and cared for properly. Additionally, they tend to hold in sweat odors more so than other fabrics.They also are great for layering! When I hit the slopes I wear a fleece over this, and it never bunches up or rubs off, or bleeds on my fleeces."
5,Like All Under Armour,"Under Armour makes incredible work out clothings. Keeps you warm (or cool when needed) and dry. The material just holds up to anything. I try to use their products whenever I can, especially when you know you are going to work up a sweat. This was the first piece of ""warm"" clothing I tried and was not dissapointed."
4,Fits small,"We recently purchased this item and I would say that it is of great quality, as all Under Armour products are. The shirt fits small since it is supposed to be snug to the body. Arms are generous in length.Great product!"
4,Convenient,"It was nice to not have to hunt through different sports stores to find a color that all my friends don't have. I already own one of these tops, they're great. The only complaint I have is: I did not order the color sky, I ordered the brighter blue--oh well, it will still function like I need it to. Thanks for the quick delivery, it's just now getting cold here at altitude and these form fitting tops fit well under jumpsuits."
5,my review,Great product; keeps me warm -- a little hard to put on over my head but the snug fit is great to keep out the winter cold
2,Too tight for a chubby short woman,This did not fit me well but I think it is my build - short and dumpty. I loved the color and material but it was too tight!
3,ColdGear Compression Mock Tops by Under Armour,"Top definitely keeps me warm, often sweating with a light jacket after a two mile walk. However, the feel of hte material is not the best on the skin. I feel like I've been saram wrapped. Nike puts a felt like layer in between which feels better and less sticky to the skil."
1,[NCAA Final Four 2001],"I purchased a Playstation console in early Novermber and was excited to play a college basketball game. Unfortunately, NCAA Final Four 2001 was the first college hoops game on the market this year. Figuring 989 might know what they're doing, I was excited to make the purchase. Well, it was a horrible mistake. The gameplay is weak, the rosters are incorrect (in the least the starting lineups are way off from real life) and the graphics are poor. I still love college hoops and ended up buying March Madness 2001 and was very impressed. Honestly, if you want better gameplay, graphics and real players & rosters (although they did get the race of a few players wrong), this is the game to play. Have fun! - Hoops Man"
2,This game is terrible,"At first I rented this game. And I am glad I didn't buy it because it is really bad. There are so many problems with this game. A big problem is that the computer never ever misses. The touch shooting is a terrible feature. With this feature, you won't miss either. I chose Arizona and decided to play against Wake Forest. I won 133-114. The graphics are horrible and it doesn't tell you any players names. Just their numbers and their position. They don't rank teams during the regular season. The game play is terrible. Please take my advise and don't buy this game. If you want a better college game for Playstation try March Madness 2001."
5,book,I am always looking for big books for my classroom and this one is perfect for my farm unit I do.
3,"Nice book, but not a favorite...","Pictures are rudimentary - well, just not so great, let's say and the wording could have been more pleasing to the ear. Nothing for readers/listeners - especially very young ones - to catch on to!"
4,Very good,"I think this book is an evergreen among books. ""Romantic"" way of writing covered by practical knowledge and techniques. I would recommend reading it.Especially for people doing CG this could open some new ways, ideas looks."
4,dale rodkin,The book is great but a dvd a bought in the same week is of terrible quality.The movie is called 'The Deal'. Is there anything I can do about this>best regardsdale rodkin
1,book written in the 40's,"If you are looking for Hollywood history this is the right book.. it was written in the 40's!!but I wasn't interested in history, I would like to learn something about lighting, the book is about cinema lights.. of the 40's... you can always learn something but... I'd rather prefer something more near to me..."
1,Horrible cheap hats,"I ordered two of these hats and got two very THIN, SHORT and cheaply made ""hats"" that looked like they were made for a small child. They did not measure anywhere NEAR what the listing states - these were SEVEN INCHES long TOTAL - with no cuff, very thin, and very very tight, even on a 16 year old!I went to target and found the right hats for $2.99 each i assorted colors."
1,CDM 8940,Save your money. This software is full of junk and I can not recommend it at all. Does not install completely and is not userfriendly.Just jumk!!!
2,"Cable works, but software install was difficult.","The cable appears to work fine, but just installing the software was a chore on Windows XP Pro. One of the drivers got itself in a loop where it kept saying ""reboot to complete install"", which it never did. After a bit of time on their website, I finally found a tech note for what to do next. The notes aren't very clear and appear to be poorly translated.Now that it's installed, I like being able to transfer items back and forth, but the number of tones on the disk that I'd actually ever put on the phone is limited. Today I'd probably just go with a cheaper, older copy rather than get the current version."
1,The SouljaBoys of the early 90s,"Probably the worst piece of [expletive] that Michael Jackson ever made the mistake of having his name associated with, this is just not good rap to begin with, and is made worse by the fact that it's fronted by a couple of kids. It's too dark and grimy for kids, and lacks the introspectiveness and depth of a true piece of ghetto-dom. Especially atrocious is the usage of samples of the great Yarbrough & Peoples disco hit ""Don't Stop The Music,"" and adding lyrics like ""we're gonna drop the bomb"" to it. And finally, the kids themselves are quite scary-looking. JD TRU (the black kid) needs to get that stupid oversized ring out of his nose, and Kaos (the white kid) has a very ghostly and sinister look about him, as if he came straight out of a morbid horror flick. Just awful, period."
5,I'm waiting,"I, like Peter, saw the show just a couple months ago in Madison Wisconsin. It was the Chicago group that was performing. Absolutely loved the show, but have been waiting (im)patiently to receive the CD. I hope I get it soon."
4,sing to me,"What a run of the emotions: humor, tenderness and the added features are a great bonus..good viewing."
5,Fun and funny,This recording was a delight to listen to. The songs were funny and fun. One would have to listen to the particular tracks. In this review it might not be appropriate to write about the topics. But the Marilyn Monroe song was quite good.
5,FAGULOUS show -- above-average recording,"I saw the show in NYC, after listening to the LA cast recording. I was amazed at how thought-provoking the show was on stage. After a couple songs, the novelty of 8 studly naked boys onstage wears off and you're caught up in the ideas behind the songs.As for this recording, the LA voices are above-average, one or two better than that, and a couple less than that. The NYC cast had much stronger voices -- is that because theatre is ""dead"" in LA? :)But do buy the CD -- it's a wonderful pastiche of songs. And if you've seen the show, the songs bring back, vividly, the staging you witnessed."
1,Not thorough enough,"LJ's book is mostly a regurgitation of Warren Buffett's letters combined with a few exerpts from the Enron and other shareholder letters. She's clearly fallen under the spell of the Oracle from Omaha. I wish there were new insights here about evaluating people for business partnerships, but there isn't anything of the sort. Rather, we get a childlike and skin deep analysis of a few shareholder letters spliced into a sparse review of Buffett's letters. Very disappointing."
3,A handful of classics surrounded by lots of filler,"Do you really need to be told again that Emmylou's voice is ""splendid"" and that it's capable of ""capturing your soul""? You know that. The anticipated quality of production is also sterling and the expected astonishing level of musicianship is also of course in attendence. So, the only real question to answer is whether this particular Emmylou recording is for you. And despite the majority of the material being inferior and, well, boring, there are four tracks here that are so outstanding they really deserve to be heard: ""Wheels of Love"", Springsteen's ""Tougher Than the Rest"", ""Wheels of Love"", and, best of all, ""Rollin' and Ramblin'"". So don't make this the first Emmylou you buy. Or the second. Just add it to the collection somewhere down the line."
4,Underappreciated,"Many hail Emmylou Harris' 1990 album BRAND NEW DANCE, her worst album. I think it is an unfair comparison. To compare this album against albums like RED DIRT GIRL, WRECKING BALL or ROSES IN THE SNOW, is simply unfair. This album has its own flow and beauty, and its own appeal. It opens with the single ""Wheels of Love"", and is followed by Bruce Springsteen's ""Tougher Than The Rest"". ""In His World"" is a beautiful, almost magical song. THe title track is an album highlight, as is the album closer ""Red, Red Rose"". True, it is not her strongest effort, but there are some true gems to be found if you listen to this album. Other highlights include ""Better Off Without You"", ""Never Be Anyone Else But You"" and ""Easy For You To Say"". Don't believe all the negativity, don't believe what you read, listen and form your own opinions about BRAND NEW DANCE, you might be surprised."
3,Not up to par,"I have about 12 emmylou CDs, the best being Weaking Ball and the worst being my lastest edition Brand New Dance. The song are just not as good."
5,"Fantastic read, incredibly informative","Campbell's book is perfect for anyone looking to a solid introduction to historical linguistics. It came highly recommended by a friend of mine who is a professor at Cambridge.Not only does it introduce you to the basic concepts of the field, it teaches you how to apply them.Perhaps the only drawback is the lack of answers to the exercises. However, if you re-read the chapter preceding the exercises, you will probably be able to figure out the correct answer.I highly recommend it!"
3,pretty good although typographical problems,"this book was really pretty good. it is a bit difficult in some of the examples for you to work because they use the orthographic tradition it was taken from, so in one example there may be different symbols for the same sound, which is confusing and complicates the problem, but is more similar to real life encounters with this work. also, sometimes there is a dot under a letter, but it looks like it is a dot on the line below above those letters; it is spread too far apart and is sometimes confusing. definitions and terms are criticized for not having any clear definitions, but the ones he gives are just as vague. the book covers a lot and once past the difficulties is pretty good"
3,Flawed...,"In general, the book is quite good. The main problem is regarding the lack of continuity/uniformity when providing transcriptions. Most of the time, it is not clear if the representation is phonetic or orthographic. Furthermore, he uses symbols that are not IPA in the middle of IPA symbols, sometimes without telling us. Also, the diacritics are badly printed in many places in the book, appearing on the line under where they should be...I guess I should say then that the book is good for its theoretical part, but quite disappointing for the exercises it provides."
4,A View of Ernest Holmes,"This hardly known book in today's Religious Science Movement is filled with personal stories of Dr. Ernest Holmes on his spiritual retreats to Asilomar as well as his work as a practitioner and leader of the Institute of Religious Science, a metaphysical institute of great importance to world religions. William Hornaday captures the essence of the mystic and the extravert, Ernest, who has changed millions of lives through his Wisdom of the Ages. If you are someone of faith and a person for all religions, this is the book for you. If you have lost your way in the terror of dogma, ritual or exclusion, the stories in this book will lighten your heart and soul. And if you are already a fan of Ernest Holmes, this book is a ""must have"" in your collection."
4,Inspiration on Every Page,"We've just ordered a new copy of ""Your Aladdin's Lamp"" because our old copy has literally fallen apart from being read and reread. Every story in this book is an inspiration and I recommend it highly. And I have proven in my own life, time and again, that yes, it really does work. Thank you, William Hornaday!"
4,very well done,"I really enjoyed this concert DVD. The sound is excellent. The performance is mesmerizing; it was one hell of a show.Occasionally, I was a little distracted by the post production editing which detracted from the show. That is my one complaint.I'm not familiar with all the artists that assisted with the show, but I am assuming it was a huge A-list of Hip Hop stars.I would definitely see the Gorillaz in concert after watching this DVD."
4,A new fan,"I was unfamiliar with the music of Gorillaz before watching this DVD. I'm very impressed. The sound runs the gamut from tuneful, moving ballads to rousing hip-hop numbers. The stage show is excellently arranged and produced. The numerous guest stars and instrumental arrangements keep things lively and prevent the sound from getting into a rut. Very enjoyable."
5,One of the best concerts EVER!!!!,This concert is absolutely incredible. The list of guest performers is impressive. The way they translated this cartoon group for live performance was really creative. I wish I could have seen it in person!This is a must have for all Gorillaz fans!
5,Double your Pleasure,"Great DVD. You can play it in two modes. First is as a standard concert. You get a great feel for the atmosphere, lights videos the incredible array of musical talent on stage. The second option is you can view the video creations that played during the concert separately.Can't wait to see what they do for the Plastic Beach tour!!!"
4,Gorillaz concert,If anyone is a big fan of the group gorillaz then they would be pretty much satisfied with their live concert in Manchester. Though I kind of thought there would be like some sort of hologram or like a stand ins of the group on stage that was a little disapointing but you know hey at least the performance were really good. They play all of the songs from the album I think ? but if anyone love this group then hell get this DVD. But if anyone is not down with this group then don't get this DVD
5,Demon days are here.,"You know, normally I can't stand live albums. Let alone movies about live shows. The whole point of seeing a band live is to experience the moment. But, you already know that. So, buy this. It's worth it."
1,Great Band........ Horrible DVD,"I have been a big Gorillaz fan for quite some time. The DVD has way too many musicians in it and is pretty horrible. They slaughtered the Demon Days album. Who ever did the vocals for the song Dare on this DVD should be shot. I think he might have been drunk. The visuals are great.....but the music sounds horrible. Maybe its me, I bought this DVD because of the reviews. I would not recommend this to anyone. This is a true mass confusion of musical talent. Sorry to rain on anyones parade.Tip"
5,Business Book of the Year,"From the management consulting firm that brought us In Search of Excellence here its latest contribution to the literature on business growth. Based on an worldwide Mckinsey research project, the book provides CEO's with a simple framework of understanding how businesses grow sustainably and easily applied metrics for understanding growths in different horizons. Another strength of the book lies in its emphasis on a differientated approach towards talent management in different horizons of growth. The challenge lies in maintaining growth in a company's core businesses while launching new ventures. As the book demonstrated, planning for growth is not formulaic but requires the nurturing of a pipeline of business opportunities"
5,A masterful uncommercial recording,"This recording epitomizes Sinatra's ability to truly tell a story. His mastery of inflection, phrasing and living the lyrics are truly demonstrated. ""What's Now Is Now"" ranks up with his finest. His heart and soul pour out. One can feel the sorrow, particularly when he awaits Elizabeth's return, only to have the train leave the station, the sound receding and, alas, there's no Elizabeth.This album should have been a hit, but I believe it didn't have the commercial flavor that the disc jockeys and the public favor.If one can ""get into"" music, feel it, live it, this recording will bring tears to the eyes. My wife and I have had many emotional moments listening to ""Watertown"". A Masterpiece!"
3,Some good - some bad,"The concept and story of the album as well as some tunes are great.But overall, this is not Sinatra's bag.If u want something along these lines, try A MAN ALONE."
2,Disappointing,"I grew up in the 60s and 70s listening to Sinatra being played on standards and pop stations, like the late, great WIP in Philadelphia. While not a big hit, the song ""I Would Be In Love Anyway"" got a fair amount of airplay. From the first time I heard it, I thought that song was hauntingly beautiful and musically interesting, so I was intent on hearing the other songs on the album from which it came. But in my opinion they are weak, forced, and unremarkable. I suppose if you put on a CD as background music and repeat it often enough, songs can grow on you, but I expected at least some of the other songs to grab me the way this one did the first time I heard it. Sadly, none did."
1,Weak Material; Sinatra miscast,"This is an album with two passable songs, ""Goodbye"" and ""I Would be in Love Anyway."" Most of the other tunes range from weak to insipid. Although Sinatra sings all the material with sensitivity and intuitiveness, the vocal portrayal of him as a man who has lived his entire life in a small town and worked for the Sante Fe railroad is unconvincing. The understated lyrical feel of Jake Holmes's lyrics is undercut by the overblown nature of both Bob Gaudio's melodies and Charles Callelo's arrangements."
5,A Favorite Sinatra,"I discovered this album about a year ago and after listening to it several times in that year it has become one of my favorite Sinatra recordings. This is not like the great Nelson Riddle and Billy May albums that can be put on in the background while paying cards with the neighbors, or the Only The Lonely that I love but take in small doses, it is an album that I find I usually play through when I have a quiet hour. Imagine sitting across the table from the person you love, they are quietly telling you goodbye; after they leave you write but get no answer, you tell then about the children, you wait for them to return. That's the essence of the story and Sinatra makes you feel it.If you are a Sinatra fan this is a must buy.Richard"
4,Take a trip to Watertown,"I bought this cd expecting nothing. I found it at a Tower Records going out of business sale. I had never heard of this album, and hadn't heard any of the songs previously. I have always been a fan of Sinatra's reprise era records, although the quality certainly varied, they were a time of creative expressions and different musical styles.Watertown certainly rates as one of his best recordings from this era. The song cycle was excellent. His voice expressive and the instrumentation interesting. I play this cd often. When you hear this recording you hear the voice of a man who has been around the block. A man who has had his share of heartbreak. This is accomplished without coming across as maudlin. Try it."
5,Quidditch Harry Potter is cool!,My 11 year old daughter is a Harry Potter fan. She has the doll on display in her room. She says the coolest part is the golden snitch because it is magnetic and can stick almost anywhere.
2,Not that great,"I have to say this was a pretty disappointing figure. As a toy for a child it's okay (not great), but as part of a figure collection it is sub-par. I had a hard time getting Harry to stay on his stand, and he keeps letting go of his broom and snitch, the magnet quality is poor. I'm glad I picked this up out of a bargain bin, because the quality of this igure is quite low."
5,Awesome Toy,"This toy is the best action figure you can buy for the price.The feet and the hands are magnetic, so you can attach it to the broom and the golden snitch.The action figure is pretty big, it is about the size of a Gi-Joe action figure.The only thing I would say is not good is the snitch its kinda impossible to catch it, overall it is a very good action figure."
2,Dare I say it...,"Dare I say I don't like this toy? Considering past reviews, probably not. All I'll say is it is completely un-realistic, badly made, undetailed, and un-proportioned. Has anyone else on earth realized the snitch is WAlNUT sized? Apparently not. Or maybe you've all never seen a walnut. Now consider this: If you were flying 100ft above the ground on a STICK, would YOU wear enormous sunglasses/goggles? Neither would I."
4,Very nostalgic experience for native Detroiters!!,"This is a great documentary on the vibrant Detroit of yesteryear!! Everybody seems to be so busy""knocking""the Motor City,tha they tend to forget the town when it was in its' heyday!! These great days are revisited in this enlightening documentary!! The statistics speak for themselves,as far as the bustling metropolis Detroit once was..At one time roughly 2 MILLION people lived in this city of(a mere)140 square miles!! Talk about a great population DENSITY(The hallmark of any""true""city!! In comparison Houston Texas""requires""nearly SIX HUNDRED square miles to be able to boast a population of 1,872,00!!! Among the legendary attractions discussed here that Detroiters enjoyed were amusement parks such as""Jefferson Beach"",""Edgewater""and:Bob-lo Island""amusement park and boat rides..This is a great ride down memory-lane that actually sheds a positive light on Detroit!! Great stuff!!"
5,"Detroit, Remember When","This is a great look back at Detroit in its hay day. very enjoyable. My family and I remembered all the places that we use to go for a nice time, like Boblo, and edge water parkalong with Bellisle."
4,Check out TW's CD!,"Hey kidz,If you haven't gotten Tony's latest CD, you better get it.

5,Exec handbook for liability!,This is a good read for all C level management to understand the liability issues their company may be put in due to web based applications.
1,Please...,"This book is nothing more than a trite rehash of the kind of security stuff you can find in any Google search. Save your money and get anything by Bruce Schnier, Steven Northcutt, etc.If I could get my money back I would. What a waste."
4,we like the soup but price was too high.,I cannot find this soup in any of the grocery stores in our area. I did not read the description very well because i thought i was getting more than 1 package of soup for the money. Was too high will not purchase again.
5,Love it,"Love the pomade, hope they don't discontinue it is becoming harder and harder to get. Hair is soft and manageable when straightened."
5,The best of the best,"Short review because I have nothing but the best things to say about this package. If you are a true piano jazz fan like myself, this is a must own dvd. Buy it.. you WILL NOT be disappointed!"
5,Boba Fett Wobbler,I own this Boba Fett wobbler and the other variations. They are all well made and are well sculpted. Not sure I would do as the other reviewer and leave in a hot car. It is made out of vinyl and does not do well in the heat.
4,Little Bobba Fett stands out,"Purchased this for my brother who is a Star Wars fan, detail is nice and construction seems sturdy enough, has only a loose piece that could break (helmet's antenna). Definetely a nice addition to any SW fan's desk."
4,My husband loves it,We recieved the Boba Fett Bobble Head quickly and it arrived safetly. This is my husbands favorite Star Wars character and was so happy to get it. The antenna can easily break if you are not careful but other than that its great.
1,Don't put this in your car,"I bought this Boba Fett Bobble Head because I thought it'd be pretty sweet to have sitting on my dashboard. Unfortunately, the plastic softened in the sun. It's not even summer yet, has reached 80 degrees maybe twice this year in Chicago. My bobble head boba started slowly leaning forward and the body and head were softer than my dog's chew toys. If you are considering one of these for your car, make sure you live in an arctic climate, otherwise one day you'll find yourself with a melted plastic puddle on your dash, covering your console, and ground into the carpet. Yuck!"
2,"Does not fit 43""","The product itself was fine. However, it will in no way fit 43 inches in length. I am fairly strong myself; both myself & a man could not stretch this cover to fit onto the board."
1,It didn't fit!,"My husband and I both tried to put this cover on and ony got sore fingers out of it! The dimensions were exactly right to match my ironing board but the cover is cut to short. It is made very well, however it should have been made longer!"
1,shorty,Cover did not fit. Both husband and I tried our best to stretch cover over board. Had to return. Cut was wayyy to short
3,"Will not work on ""over the door"" ironing board","My own fault this didn't work out. The dimensions were correct for my ""over the door"" board so I thought all ""small ironing board"" covers would work for me. This is SPECIFICALLY for HIDE-AWAY. Will NOT work on an ""over the door"" ironing board. Or any other small ironing board."
3,It was okay but....,"It didnt fit my over the door ironing board. I guess it would be perfect for a ""hideaway type ironing board. Probably my own fault. I should have read it more carefully."
4,Hide-a-way Ironing BoardCover,"This hard to find item was exactly what I was looking for. It seemed a bit pricey to me, but I could not find it anywhwere else."
5,Perfect!,The board I have is in the wall...it was a little snug but not unmanageable to put on and fit absolutely perfect!
1,Cover for built-in ironing board,What a useless product. The cover dimensions were a match to my built-in ironing board but it didn't fit at all. It wasn't made to cover the tapered end of an ironing board. The cover was 'stretchy' in that it had an elasticized hem. But it was like trying to use a big shower cap as an ironing board cover. No amount of clips could have adjusted to fit to be right. A total waste of money.
4,Understanding Wine (VHS) Jancis Robinson,"It's amazing to watch Michael Broadbent at a youger age. Jancis is a young women with her same old great ""Brit Wit"". The video is not only entertaining, but there's 4 videos. What a bargain at todays values. She walks us through the world of wine, auctions, producers, and many other related wine events. I recommend this video for someone who already understands some of the basics, otherwise they might not get the most out of it. Jancis hair is outrageous!"
2,GOOD SONG BUT...,this is another one of those things that makes you ALMOST hate the song cause you hear 10 different versions of it and all of them have the same lyrics repeated over and over again. Not something that gets much (if any) play in my player though I do still like the original song on the CD.
1,Broke after limited use,"I've seen other posts indicating their K200 broke after limited use. Same thing happened with mine... green lights no longer light up and batteries don't charge. This after limited use. Further, Kodak's website is useless vis a vis support: no user guide, no information about known problems, no troubleshooting. They really should support the products that they sell better.Product unquestionably is an unmitigated piece of junk. My only further complaint is that they don't have ratings that go into negative territory, because that's what this product deserves; 1 star is an overstatement.In short, buy something else."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP,"I bought this product plus 2 Kodak AAA rechargeables for my Handspring Visor. I've only had this item for 3 months and already it has stopped working. The green light that indicates that the recharger is working--has STOPPED. Therefore it will not recharge the batteries at all. I'm stuck with a crappy product and am going to return it to the manufacturer. DO NOT BE FOOLED!! i bought this item based on the reveiws here at Amazon and apparently they were not thorough enough. Save your money and don't waste your time on this product by Kodak. Btw, Handspring also recommends that you do NOT use rechargeable batteries for the Visor Deluxes. They recommend only alkaline batteries or special rechargeable units that are sold on some obscure site. Ask them; i did and after i bought this Kodak unit i was sadly informed that Visors Deluxes should NOT use rechargeables."
1,Thr unwizard of Oz.,"In this book, Mr.Oz goes to war against all rules -- and the rules win.He breaks the narrative up into short passages, each with a cryptic headline, and jumps from point of view to point of view, sometimes within the same sentence. All of a sudden he pops into the narrative (as the 'fictional narrator'} to explain that it's poetry I have been reading and that he understands how wierd it is to set a story in the town of Bat Yam.From then on the reader meets Mr Oz every now and then, sometimes in the guise of the 'fictional narrator'sometimes in the flesh in his in his home in Arad. Why? I couldn't figure it out. Was he also getting bored with the story's characters?The upshot of this all, at least for this reader, is a complete lack of tension, and a complete lack of interest in the characters and their fate.There must be something in those rules."
1,Obnoxious,"Snippets of a book that the author seems to have been too lazy to weave together. The narrator's (cum author's) presence in the story is more than an intrusion, it's a contrived device that reeks of bathetic soul-searching -- probably on why this abomination was ever released. This effort is not worthy of OZ."
4,Robeez are fantasic!,I have 2 kids and both wear Robeez. They look great and come in a large variety of styles. I accidently sent a pair through the washer and dryer and they are still fine. They're not great for walkers though. Not enough support. Perfect for infants.
4,Further to my last review.........,I've had a couple of requests from people to let them know the names of the episodes in this collection. So I thought I'd put them on here. They are:-The Day The Balloon Went Up - Sons of the Sea - Don't Forget The Diver - Asleep in the Deep - Boots Boots Boots - A Soldier's Farewell - Big Guns - Menace From The Deep - The Bullet Is Not For Firing - Mum's Army - The Armoured Might Of Lance Corporal Jones - Put That Light Out - The Two and a Half Feathers - The Test - Fallen Idol - The Deadly Attachment - If The Cap Fits - The Honourable Man
3,BFS Video Drops the ball again!,"The programme content and acting in Dad's Army is superb. What a pity then that BFS Video, Canada, producers of this DVD have once again released a sub-standard product in terms of picture quality.The video is encoded at only 2-3 mps for the most part, resulting in smearing and blockiness.I will be cautious in buying any future releases having already been stung with Six Wives of Henry VIII which was also very poor.Please BFS! Get your act together."
4,Almost perfect,"Fabulous to see some of the old TV programmes beginning to appear on DVD... but why oh why did no-one take time to improve the transfer? It's not as bad as it could be, but it definitely makes a mockery of the advantages of the format.I was amazed when I saw this advertised - I couldn't believe that the only place such a quintessentially British programme is available is America!The set consists of 3 DVDs containing 18 episodes, and someone put some real thought into the selection. The first appearance of the armoured car/butcher's van, the introduction of the horrendous ARP warden Hodges.Each character is so well written, from the unbearably pompous yet brave and loyal Capt Mainwaring, to mummy's-boy Private Pike, to Private Fraser with his predilection for ""big strong thighs"", to the amazing creation of Lance-Cpl Jones (even 30 years later they still don't like it up 'em)I defy anyone not to find many hilarious moments on these DVDs.... well worth buying."
2,Dads Army a collection,The DVDs froze and then jumped to the next episode which also then froze and moved to the next episode. The DVDs were not fit for purpose or of merchantable quality.
2,Disappointing,I love british comedy. My wife bought this for me with that in mind. I was disappointed in this series. It seemed rather bland and boring to me. Not nearly up to par with the others I've see.
5,DAD'S ARMY - COLLECTION,"If you are a fan of British Comedy TV Series, this one is for you!!! I have been a fan of this series for years and I can truely say that each time I watch this dvd I get a good laugh!Unlike many of the modern series, this is not gawdy humor and viewable by the whole family.My only wish is that the WHOLE series was offered to the US viewer as it is in Great Britain."
2,Get the complete collection from Amazon UK,"I have this collection, but recently discovered that I could get a complete 14 disk collection from amazon UK for about $70 delivered to the US. It is region 2, PAL, but you can get a multi-system DVD player (check the comments to find out how to change it to region ""0"") here on Amazon for under $100. For my fellow lovers of British TV, that's a great way to find a much greater variety, usually at a cheaper cost."
3,Incorrect description,"According to Grizzly online catalog, this SKU (H7568) has serrated sole, not ""perfectly flat"", as opposed to SKU H8841."
3,Reboot Taken off UK TV,Just out of interest. Reboot was taken off air in the UK because it was considered too dark for Children!! It used to come on around 4pm.
2,very diapointing,"While I'm a great fan of reboot, my second favorite show growing up (transformers was my first), this is outrageous, to charge this sort of price for four or five episodes, and they didn't even release season 1 or 2, I would gladly pay the price there asking if it was the full season, but this isn't worth it."
5,"Gotta comment on the ""Editorial Review""","ReBoot has never use motion capture for animation.... Mainframe Inc didn't start using that technology until (much) later- shortly after they finished season 4 IIRC.Aside from the (very minor) reduction in realism this causes, ReBoot seasons 3 and 4 are still some of the best animation Mainframe has done IMO."
5,Clarks chelsea,I work in Retail and the Chelsea is a very comfortable shoe to wear for work. I have worn Clarks for about 10 years and they are one of my favorite shoes.
1,The vomiting inferiority of sexism,"The author's arguments are easily refutable, while his so-called ""data"" yields itself much better to different and much more humanistic interpretations."
5,a true classic,"this game is by far the best computer game ive ever played. its just the right balance between economics, diplomacy, and war. other games old and new are heavy in one or two of those ereas and light on the third, this game hits on all cylinders. i wouldnt change a thing except make it compatable with xp."
4,Not bad,"This stuff isn't bad at all. It has a very nice, refreshing taste and although it has a bit of sugar in it, it doesn't have as mcuh as most sodas and has potassium in it. I'd definitely buy it again."
1,Fone Free,This product was a piece of junk. Not worth the paper it came in. Do not buy. I bought for my elderly dad so he would not have to pull over when driving. Useless product.
5,Works very well,This product works very well as a hands free wireless speakerphone. You cannot touch it for the price. Just make sure to get the newer updated improved model.
3,Old fashioned and somewhat confuse,"I have used this as a textbook for executive MBA students. The text is comprehensive and the reading is easy but some cases, although short, are confuse. The authors spend precious time in topics which are usually subject of other disciplines and the students have already studied, like derivatives, lease analysis, linear programming and mergers, just to name a few. On the other hand, the discussion of option models is restricted to a few pages and do not emphasize the use of options to evaluate flexibility. It's almost unconceivable to organize a course in capital budgeting without discussing real options, so the book has to be complemented, while several chapters could be eliminated."
2,unclear,"I felt that this textbook which was used for one of my mba classes was confusing. There are mistakes and typos which are unacceptable in a finance text. The cases do not get directly to the point, and add distracting information to make the case seem more 'real,' but instead it is just unclear. The explanations and examples are not explained well."
4,Very smooth and inexpensive,"The flavor is light and fresh and brews well. However, I will not give it 5 stars because the tin does not contain enough chamomile flowers."
5,Good little laptop,"I bought this laptop for my son to use while he was looking for a job, figuring that if it held up for 6 months I'd have gotten my money's worth out of it. There were a few small problems at the beginning, but the company that sold it to me stands behind their products and the problems were resolved rather quickly. It's still working just fine! My son is getting more use out of it than we expected. I've ""borrowed"" it for a few weeks while my Air Book was in the shop. It's a good little laptop."
4,great economy,"If you must buy a digital camera, then a battery charger is an essential, or else your expense on batteries will soon wipe out all the savings that you thought were possible by eliminating films! I have two digital cameras, and have tried both Olympus and Kodak chargers - Kodak charges slightly faster - it takes just under three hours. However sometimes you may be better off by buying a generic charger available at most electronics stores, but then you don't get the Kodak name. Price is the only reason I have given less-than-5 star ratings, otherwise it's a great accessory to have."
2,"Portable, easy and slow","I didn't need to read the instructions - it's easy to figure out how to use this: Just insert the AA batteries, unfold the plug, and plug it in. Two red lights come on for all four batteries (or one red light if you have one or two batteries) and when the light goes off, the batteries are fully charged.The portability will make it easy to take the digital camera on trips and have a back up set of batteries.The negatives: I suspect there may have been a few occasions when the batteries didn't get a full charge because the plug came loose -- based on a shorter life span of the batteries after charging.Also, I got another brand battery charger as part of a package deal. The other brand charges faster than this one and the batteries for that brand last longer than this one."
3,Cheating the customer?,"Beware of the misleading title. This DVD narrates the history of the Royal Air Force from World War I to the present. The crucial 1940 ""Battle of Britain"" is evoked only during a few minutes of the 94 minutes feature. Once you get over your initial disappointment, it's a good documentary. It shows interesting footage of the fighters and bombers used by the R.A.F. through the years. Any planes-lover will enjoy that. But I do feel a bit cheated. This DVD was released in 2000, the year of the 60th anniversary of the ""Battle of Britain"". I guess that explains the misleading title. The company wanted to take advantage of the historical event."
1,i cant belive yall children,yall children are weird beyblade went out of style like 1 and a half years ago
5,Excellent batteries !,"Finally, someone made REAL AAA rechargeable batteries.You don't need nothing else."
2,My Review,I can`t say much because i did not get what i ordered they sent me another prouduct! I ordered Effergrip Extra Strength Denture Adhesive Cream 2.5 Oz and recieved Effergrip Denture Adhesive Cream - 2.5 Oz and they didn`t even say why. I woud not order from them again. It came from ABC.
5,Good product,"I have used this product for years, but our local stores discontinued the product. I would recommend Effergrip to all my friends"
5,45+ Years of Dentures,"I have really bad teeth form birth and by the age of 15 Had all of my real teeth removed and dentures put into place. I started usng denture adhesive within the first yer of wearing dentures. Poli-grip was the only thing available at that time. One day i needed to purchase a new tube of poli-grip and was a little short on cash that day. Effergrip was on the shelf next to it and was a few dollars cheaper. I said well I'll try this and i bought Effergrip. Effergrip held as good if not better and I haven't gone back to poli-grip since. The place I use to purchase Effergrip, Wal-Mart, stopped carrying the product. The closest store to me that still carried the product was 45 miles away. I found tht Amazon.com not only sold the product but was a cheaper purchase even with the shipping cost. It was also more convenient now since I have become handicapped and require a wheelchair when shopping. I can purchase the quantity i need and have it delivered right o my door."
5,Prevent Zinc poisoning,I have worn dentures since early 70's not realizing the potential problems with zinc poisoning. Effergrip is zinc-free and works just fine. Using for 7 years now.
3,denture cream,I am testing denture creams with no zinc and Effergrip is passable in the holding dept.
2,Not true to size,"These shoes are so soft. They would have been perfect for me, except that the size 10 I ordered was more like a size 8. Since I am not living in the US, I was unable to return them. I was truly disappointed."
4,GREAT BUT RUNS VERY SHORT!,"I just received these great, lightweight shoes. They are good looking and comfy but sun very small. I usually wear an 8.5 and ordered the 9. I have to send them back but I will get the 10 and hope they fit."
4,Truly a delightful tale written in a breezy style,"I just finished ""Malice in Miniature"" and was again thrilled by the down to earth quality of the book. Unlike many so called mysteries, this one contains no obviously upsetting scenes. Dorothy Martin is my kind of amateur sleuth. Not glamorous or ""sexy"", she uses her natural curiousities to solve another case. Though often her now husband, Alan, tries to dissuade her from getting involved, her natural tendency to befriend people keeps her right in the midst of the action. I also liked the idea of a novel with a miniature doll house theme, positively fascinating. I highly recommend this book to others."
2,Dorothy meows!,"A rather disappointing addition to the otherwise charming Dorothy Martin series. Dorothy usually pokes fun at other characters, but this time becomes downright nasty when describing other female characters. Maybe all isn't bliss with the adorable Alan, hmmm? Too, the ending is contrived, twee, and generally incredible. The addition of a auditorially challenged youngster is a welcome nuance, but the sub-plot never really leads anywhere. Finally, from a legal point of view, I must wonder if Dorothy now functions as an agent of the police and that all of her findings would be tossed (sorry, just the paralegal in me). Oh, well, Ms. Dams, nobody but Dorothy L Sayers ever batted 1.000!"
1,The Autobiography of St.Margret Mary,"I read it from cover to cover and found it unbelievably extremely bizarre.After reading books i usually pass them on to other readers but this one ,I threw in the trash.She may have been a saint in her own way and in her own time, but today's woman could not,should not emulate this strange and eccentric way. marge"
4,You seem stressed out,You seem stressed out. You should slow down for a moment and enjoy a hot cup of chamomile tea.
5,I LOVE IT,This game is the coolest!!!!!! You have got to check it out!!! In this game you can clear blocks and in some parts of it you can win pokemon doing so!!!!!!!!! A perfect gift for a POKEMANIAC!!!!!!!
1,"Way too hard, regardless of difficulty!","This game is too hard to conquer, because when you try to solve the puzzles with your quick wits, the opponent will keep attacking you, over and over. It makes me both angry and sick, because you have no choice but to keep on dying! If you want to play puzzle games, I recommend Arkanoid, Buster Bros. and Jack Brothers. This game is not worth playing!"
5,The Story Well written in this very entertaining game,"This game has an excellet story line and is approriate for all ages. I feel it should sell extremely well, and very easily could be one of the top sellers of all time."
1,Bad,I think this game is the worst game in the world!Dont buy it!!I hope this review will convince all of you not to buy this treacherous game. Your welcome for my precious time!
3,Not their best,"So first of all, I'm a huge fan of Galactic. That being said this was not my favorite CD. It is good filler, many good songs with no great songs. It represents the older style, and a few of the songs are live staples - which sound great live. Good to have though if you really like Galactic"
3,Why were they holding back?,"After hearing the live versions of most of these songs before hearing this album I was thouroughly dissapointed with how the songs were performed on this CD. Go Go, Love on the Run, and Crazyhorse Mongoose are all intense when heard live. On this CD they are slower and much less fiery than I was used to hearing them. This album just does not represent who Galactic is. Their new CD Late for the Future does that, and actually adds more. Leave this one go, and grab some live tapes of their shows to hear these songs with all of the intensity that they have. I couldn't believe Galactic could release this album and actually be satisfied with the end product. It's like the Sunday Afternoon Galactic here. Why not just play these songs like they do live without the lengthy solos?"
1,What the **** is this ****?!?!?,"I .... oh.... dear GOD what... a horrible.. no... dreadful... wait, I got it... A waste of time AND space. The one-star rating is WAY too generous, unfortunately I can't give anything lower. I can't understand how in the world anyone would even ponder releasing this junk. It some how came out straight-to-video...it should have gone straight-to-the-TRASH!!!!"
2,Sideways board,"Believe it or not, this is the second travel chess board I bought witl a sideways orientation. The makers of these boards apparently don't really play the game (white on right). Don't worry, I bought them at the same time, so I didn't repeat my mistake. Anyway, I would advise you look closely at the picture before buying this item. At least you can bend back the end under the board, but it's still pretty awkward for one of the players."
5,"somewhat dated (in 1999), but otherwise superb overview","I first read PACIFIC RISING in 1991, the year of publication and felt it was the absolute best overview of the Pacific I'd ever read. I'm not sure I've changed my mind, despite the intervening years. Mr Winchester, who lived in Hong Kong, connects Peru with Indonesia; Korea with Seattle; Guam with Panama. The book is filled with anecdotes and factoids, all of them interesting and worth knowing, but he never loses an academic focus. This is an absolute must for anyone who wants to understand what ""the Pacific"" is all about."
3,"Good breadth of subject, depth is lacking, lot of errors","The book gives a fairly good breadth of subject, but is lacking in depth, and also does not give good intuitive sense of the subject. The book contains lot of typos and numerical errors that need to be addressed.The book seems more intent on giving a lot of formulas and wireless situations, instead of enabling the student to think independently, and giving the tools for the student to think and derive the answers to issues.The chapter on channel models for example gives a bunch of models for different fading conditions, but does not even clarify when the models apply, and how to apply them. After reading the chapter, I am not sure when each model applies and how to apply them."
2,Too many errors!,"I used this book for a graduate level wireless comm. class taught by the author herself. This book is rife with errors especially in the first few chapters. Things got so bad that I started questioning every result presented in the book that I could not immediately understand and prove, thinking that it might be incorrect. This book is not recommended for self study due to these numerous errors unless the reader is just browsing and wants a qualitative understanding. One observation is that the author sacrifices breadth for depth in her coverage of the material. A minor quibble is that the author misses opportunities to give simple proofs for ""low hanging fruit"" results and just keeps presenting page after page of results and formulae. These translate to missed opportunities to build intuition for the student. In summary this book while it tries to be comprehensive suffers severely from sloppiness and is not recommended."
2,"It is a good book, but, I did not get my delivery yet, it has been more than one month, what is wrong??","It is a good book, but, I did not get my delivery yet, it has been more than one month, what is wrong??Can anyone in amazon give me a explanation? or where can I check it?"
1,NOT lounge!,"this is not lounge, don't waste your time, have no idea what the other reviewer was listening to! try this instead;Lounge Italian Style: Laid Back Beats from Italy"
5,Sophisticated Lounge,"Nice Sophisticated Lounge music it is awesome to the ears so pleasant & really delightfully fun to hear, I mean what adult American does not at least know Mambo Italiano, come on, other songs are more romantic and a hint more soothing than Mambo Italiano but all to chill too for real. BUY THIS, BUY THIS. You will love it too if you can handle my description. This is definately nothing American Adult Contemporary Stuff, Gross No. This is real sophisticated Italian fun lounge. Go Ahead and buy it."
4,Happy Buy!,"Although there have been negative reviews of the packaging, I am quite happy with my purchase. The disks were in great condition and codes for the digital copies were included. It would be good if they could improve the packaging a little more. Make it easier to open and close...and more compact."
3,"Nice set of movies, but the packaging is weak.","First, the movies are great and the addition of Cars Toons is nice. However, for the price you would expect a much nicer packaging of the discs.Overall, the set is very comprehensive including all of the possible disc options, including 3D and digital copies. I love that Disney includes the regular DVDs so that we can use them in the car, on travel with the laptop or portable DVD player, or the kids can watch in their playroom.So, in conclusion, if you do not own Cars 1 or 2 already and you are looking to add to your Disney collection, this is a good option."
3,"Great Product, Lousy Packaging","The contents of this package are great. Blu-ray, SD, and Digital copy of the three films. The way this packaged together is absolutely horrible. The foam insert is useless. I finally just got some jewel cases to protect the discs and took the foam insert out."
4,Cars Blu Rays,"Ordered and received in 3 days which is fast, great set only give it 4 stars cause i wish it came with all 3 cars in 3d and only part 2 is 3d...."
2,Confusing product detail,Very confusing description of the product. Thought I was ordering powdered formula and instead received liquid. Very easy to exchange the product however I was charged for the liquid (which is more expensive) and can't seem to get a hold of anyone at the company to refund me the difference.
4,Shoulder surgery blessing.,I must say day to day I do not and cannot use this pillow. I get to sweaty and can't turn over. The not being able to turn over part is why I purchased this though. I had shoulder surgery and was trying to sleep in a recliner. It was not going well. I tried this pillow and was able to sleep in BED. It kept me from being able to turn over onto my bad shoulder. For that reason I love this pillow. It is now put away in the even of any other events.
2,Cheap and Uncomfortable,"I ignored the negative reviews which was a mistake. The rounded edges/seams where your neck goes are extremely uncomfortable and have no give, so they feel rough and hard. The pillow case itself is such a poor quality thread count that it feels scratchy and cheap. the pillow material is also very cheap foam. Definitely not worth the money."
2,I really wish I could have liked this pillow,"I'm 5 months pregnant and was looking for a body pillow that would help me sleep comfortably on my side as I'm primarily a back sleeper. After trying three other pillows, I thought this would be better for me as it would provide support on both sides and keep me from rolling onto my back. Unfortunately, i tried out this pillow for two nights and it was the worse two nights of sleep! Like many people have mentioned in other reviews, the seams are so tight that they cut into any part of your body that touches against it. I woke up both mornings with neck, shoulder and back pains which I really think was attributable to the uncomfortable tight seams. I really liked the concept of the pillow and how it enveloped your entire body. It did do the job in keeping me sleeping on my side but I just wish it was softer and more comfortable."
3,Nice quality - but HUGE and not good if you want to use your own pillow under your head,"This pillow is huge - even in a king size bed. While it can be very confortable, I didn't like it - particularly because (1) I wanted to use my own pillow under my head - which means I'm laying on outside of hudge pillow; and (2) when pregnant and needing to go to bathroom every couple hours, I felt like I had to wrestle or leapfrog a barrier to get out of bed each time. I found I preferred the below pillow - although it is not perfect either (since it is smaller and doesn't necessarily stay in good position all night).http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0022B1DZG/ref=oss_product"
3,Felt smothered,"I'm only 5 feet tall, but I kind of felt claustrophobic when using this pillow...I can't imagine how taller people feel!"
4,Good pillow,"I use my pillow every night now. Part of the way through the second trimester, I could not get comfortable and had to switch to a small pregnancy pillow. I am at the end of the second trimester now and can't sleep without it. It takes up half of a queen size bed. My husband knows it helps, but I do miss having him next to me. I love having the option of turning over and still having support no matter what side I sleep on. I wish they sold them in other cover colors than white."
3,Loved and found invaluable but has a couple major design flaws.,"Love the pillow, helps me sleep although I had to supplement it with two other pillows, one for under my head and under my belly. I definitely recommend it for pregnant ladies in their late second to third trimesters. The only reason it gets 3 stars versus 4 or 5 is because it was VERY difficult to change the pillow cover and it was flatter than I had hoped. The design needs a zipper for easy pull on and off."
4,Great Purchase!,"I am 3.5 months pregnant and growing fast. Sleeping has been an adjustment for me and since I have received the body pillow I am sleeping much better. I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this item and I must say I did a great job and am impressed. I have had the pillow for about 2 weeks and it is a little firm, but am sure over time that I will break it in. It was worth every penny and I would reccommend it to anyone who asks. The only downside of the pillow is the color of the cover. I rather have a colored cover so that over time the ivory (really white) will not look worn."
5,wonderful!,"I received this pillow as a gift when I was about 5 months pregnant and my hips were KILLING me every night... After a night or two sleeping with this beauty my lower back and hips felt SO much better. It was amazing. Now that I'm almost 8 months along, I still have some pain when I wake up, but nothing compared to what it would be without this pillow. Highly recommended!One of my favorite things about it is the ability to fold it in half and make a lounger out of it. So convenient! Also, I was a little wary of wrangling the thing out of its pillowcase to wash it and then wrangling it back in, but it wasn't actually as difficult as I thought it would be."
3,hard to get out of,"I roll around a lot when I sleep so it was a problem for me to not be able to get out of the thing easily. I would wake up stuck between being on my side and on my back. It was nice when I was on my side though, and being able to flip from one side to the other without turning the pillow with you is a nice feature. The only other problem was that the seam around the inside that helps it retain its shape is not comfortable so you have to stay away from it.It was firm enough to keep some space between my knees too, which was nice, but not too firm that it was uncomfortable."
2,the shape was not right,When I ordered this product I thought it was shaped like a horse shoe. I am real pleased with the other products and I will order form you again. Happy New Year
2,great but kills my neck and shoulders,I have had this pillow for a couple weeks now and I do like it BUT...the area around the neck is sewn so tight that it cuts into my neck and shoulders that it actually bothers me all the next day. Besides that i do like it. I will probably try to call to see if i can return it. If not then i will just try to take the slip cover off and deal. Disappointed for $65. :(
2,"Comfortable, but needs more padding","I am 9 weeks pregnant with twins and recieved this pillow about 2 weeks ago. I am nearly 6 feet tall, so the pillow is a little short for where it should hit on the knees. I also feel like it is lacking a bit in the cushioning especially for the back and I find I have a hard time keeping the pillow from falling of the edge of the bed as I move at night. I have found that if I use a pillow along my back and another body pillow on the front and a pillow under my head it is very comfortable. I also am not a huge fan of the pillow cover, it is a little rough and hard to get on."
5,My wife loves this,I bought this for my wife at the start of her second trimester. She was having back problems and waking up in the middle of the night a lot. Now she can't sleep without it. We went on vacation and she had to shape the hotel pillows around her body to mimic the Snoogle. When we got back home she couldn't wait to sleep with the Snoogle again. The only bad thing about it is the pillow case is very hard to remove and even harder to put back on.
1,Didn't work for me,"I am a 5'-10"" woman of average weight - bought this during pregnancy because I had read/heard so much about how you had to get a snoogle. Ladies, save your pennies and just buy a good quality memory foam topper for your mattress. I got this thing and it made me more uncomfortable. Then, and I don't even know how we came to this except sleeping on my side was hurting, we got a Serta memory foam topper and all my pains went away. Never used this snoogle or any snoogle - just used the memory foam and we're still using it."
5,Touching and Authentic,"While reading Shana Burg's second book ""Laugh With the Moon"" I noticed that I had left my own reality and had entered the emotional, touching and sensitive life of a teen-age girl dealing with the pain of loss and meaningful changes in her life with humor and authenticity. The Malawi experience, with its food, smells, culture,coping with hardships and way of life were transmitted by a true, professional writer."
4,"""A great little 30 minute read!""","So what if this book veers away from Epictetus' original 2000 year old manuscript. So what if Sharon Lebell interjected some modern philosophy... The point is, this is just good common sense, positive attitude stuff. I liked it. If you like short, feel good commentary, you will too!"
1,Pop Philosophy,This translation loses the vigor and sharpness of previous more classical versions. She interjects too much pop psychology.
3,Small Book of Wisdom,"This is a fascinating book of ancient wisdom, still relevant today. But this version is so tiny, I recommend getting a larger one so you don't lose it."
5,Humane,The Journey was engaging and personal from page one. It is humane and helped to surface the humanity that can get buried during the daily struggle. It is a gentle anecdote that I can revisit anytime I start to loose touch with myself.
4,the power of simplicity,"I read The Journey and wrote Jed, the author, that very night. It went as follows:-------------------- With having just finished your book I'm enjoying a wonderful sense of peace, enthusiasm and beauty. It turned out to be icing on the cake and fuel for some personal growth I've been experiencing lately. For over a decade I traveled the world and spent a healthy % of my time talking with strangers..philosophizing..sharing...moving and being moved. Your story put a smile on my face as it sparked nostalgia and fertilized hungry seeds from travels past. Thank you. ----------------- The Journey is food for the soul, wisdom to light your way, and fertilizer for good vibe growth. Some of nature's most beautiful contributions are simple and sweet. Thanks again Jed and Gil.T-"
5,"An important message for life, not to be missed","In a world where our work becomes our life. Where we are asked ""Who are you?"" and you tell people what you do for a living... something is wrong, very wrong. Read this book, and you will start the journey to productive work/life balance.Read this book ... then buy a copy for your boss too."
4,Fun and Helpful,"At first, I just started to glance through The Journey, the next thing I knew I was engaged and enteracting with Jake, (one of the books characters). It's a story that almost anybody can relate to. I've often tried to follow the theory of, ""stop blaming others for my problems and think of the good things in my life"" and done pretty well at it. The Journey provides simple, re-usable tools to accoplish this task and take me to a new level."
5,History Comes to Life!,"Wendy Lawton transports us back to the voyage of the Mayflower through the eyes of young Mary Chilton. Her experiences and those of her family give us a first hand look at the trials and obstacles that had to be overcome for them to reach this country. Not usually a reader of historical fiction, I was captivated by the well-written and accurate story of the Chilton family. Wendy Lawton had done her homework! Her extensive research not only informs the reader but educates the reader about his heritage in a fast-paced and easily followed style. Definitely a good read for old and young!"
5,Plunge into History,"It's a universal truth that everyone longs to have a place to call home. It's the place where we feel most comfortable and can be ourselves. Thirteen-year-old Mary Chilton longs for the same stability in her life. Mary and her family are looking for a place to call home. In this highly readable and engaging book, Wendy Lawton takes the reader on the journey home through Mary's viewpoint. One of the 102 passengers who traveled from England to the New World on the Mayflower, Mary experiences hardship and joy as she discovers the true meaning of home and family.The research and vivid details of this book will transport young readers yet teach them something about the early settlers to the New World called America. I recommend this book and encourage you to read it as well then you can recommend it to your friends. It's the perfect recommendation or gift for any library-school or church.W. Terry Whalin..."
3,A dated film,I'm a sucker for any film with Graham Greene. At this point the film is 20 yrs old and a bit dated. But dang it! Graham is still really good in this!
2,Huck and the King of Hearts,"I like Graham Greene so I bought this video. The story is a bit hokey and not very well developed, but it's enjoyable and worth the price."
3,My mistake,"Dear AmazonThe angle drill is just great but i didn't realise the product was coming from America and rated at 120 volts, here in Australia the supply voltage is 240 volts.The tool is just what I wanted for a particular job and sending it back didn't appear to be an potion so I purchased a suitable transformer to run it.It worked out quite expensive in the end, however I may be able to run another of your 120v tools in the future.Many ThanksKind regardsWinstonn"
4,A good read,"The tiny village of Twythching is about to face the most important thing in its history - an unimportant radio program on an obscure network is coming to town (sorry - village) to profile the inhabitants. It's part of a series of such profiles with the intent of conveying a salt-of-the-earth story with a concerted dash of homey and quaint and a touch of nostalgia for Empire.But then, murder occurs.The strength of this story is in the descriptions of the village people - their petty, biting, and idiosyncratic ways. And that takes up much of the book. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The mystery part is still central to the story, but the plot isn't terribly new and the pacing lags a bit.Overall, it was a good read. If you like delving into the silly shenanigans of an English village plus a murder mystery, you will like this book."
5,"Ah, memories",I remember this show from watching Captain Kangaroo as a small child in upstate New York. Sometimes the humor in these shows could be rather tongue-in-cheek. Tippietoes was particularly funny; who would have thought that a horse could love poetry and get the tingles when he wears his woolies? I recommend this series to anyone who wants to remember what cartoons and cereal used to be like. Don't forget your woolies!
1,Nor Pro 2066 Grip- Ez Nonstick 13-Inch Splatter Screen,The edges hold in water and it rust extremely fast!
2,Not real pleased,"We have had this item for since Jan. 14 and it is already rusted. It works nice for the purpose made, however, I don't feel comfortable using it since the screen is starting to rust and the rim around the screen by the handle. I do not soak it in water-mainly it is use, clean within 45-60 min. after use and then dry and it still has begun to rust."
3,still greasy,"the screen works ok, it does block some of the grease but not all of it. I still get splatter on the tea-kettle and on the stove when cooking with grease. I have also recently seen some minor rust on the edges of the screen after washing in the dishwasher. Is this normal? Only have had it 2 months."
1,Not worth it.,"Save your money. Mine has warped and comes up around the edges of my pans. On top of that it doesn't stop enough ""splatter"" to make it worth the effort of cleaning."
3,Rusts a lot,"We've had this less than a month and water catches in the edges and rusts. Its hard to get the water out to prevent it. Also, if you accidently set something heavy on the screen it pops right out of the frame. Otherwise, it serves its purpose as a splatter screen, that's why I do not give it fewer stars."
4,Pretty good,"Well balanced, fits over much smaller pans which is nice, arrived promptly, although it does get rust quick."
4,"Great quality but 13 "" is too large","It feels good in the hand and is very sturdy. But I would use this more if it were 10"" to 11 "" diameter. At 13"" it is larger than the pans I use, and can bump up to other pots/pans on the range."
3,rusts,it's ok and does the job but after a couple uses the outer ring started rusting. We still use it but it would have been better in stainless or another non rustable material
3,splatter screen,It's just OK it doesn't really stop all splatters. I wanted it to stop the splatters from frying pan onto my stove top.
1,Spa Cloth,This cloth is not good for facial exfoliation because it is entirely too rough. It is fine for use on the rest of your body as long as you don't have sensitive skin.
2,Help!,"I recieved this item in a christmas swap. I loved the neat design and lazy susan aspect. However, I to was disappointed to find out there was no recipes. I know there are different types of fondue machines for beef, dessert, and cheese. I was not sure if I could do all of these or if it was meant for something specific. I had fondue once before and it was much different. It had a place to boil water. I was at a loss with this machine. The only information given was about Michael Graves and how he is a reknowned architect. That didn't help me at all with the cooking!"
3,why ooohh why ?,"My biggest problem with this so far was getting it out of the box. All of the parts were in little bags but vacuum sealed together as one unit. I had to tear and shread all the plastic to pieces before I could get the parts seperated. I even tried to pry them apart with a screw driver before spending 20 minutes tearing the plastic into pieces. As most others, it gives no directions, specifically with heating. I see now that you can contact Wilton to get instructions, but why do I as the consumer have to jump through hoops to get something that is pretty standard when you purchase anything. I mainly wanted it for the look and design which I am happy with."
2,Confused,"I, like most of the other people who reviewed this product, am very disappointed. I received this item as a gift and cannot return it. I would love to use it but without any instructions, am finding it impossible to figure out. Can someone who has had a positive experience with this item please tell me how to use this thing? Shouldn't there be some type of holder for the fuel? My search on-line for any instructions has not produced anything but frustration!"
1,Disappointed,"I received this fondue pot as a Christmas gift, only to be disappointed to find that it did not come with ANY instructions.... nothing that tells you how to put it together, what fuel to use, etc. Also, there were no recipes, and no fuel pot. I went back to Target to look at the ones they had there, and they also did not have the above mentioned items. I also could not find any fuel or fuel pots sold for this item. Without instructions, I would have no idea how to use it, so I will be returning it. I bought another fondue pot instead."
2,"High on style, low on function.","I love fondue parties and own multiple fondue pots. The biggest fault with the Graves set is the abscence of a burner set. I like using the Graves set because it looks so nice and I like the revolving serving dishes(although small). When I use it though I actually use a burner cover from another set. You can not just use an open can of Sterno or the like because you can not modulate the heat. Even with the proper heat I usually reserve this set for broth or oil fondues as cheese or chocolate are hard to clean. I would only reccomend cheese or chocolate to a fondue pot that is a double boiler. Williams & Sonoma has a great set. Even with moderated heat, hot spots are hard to avoid on the Graves set burning cheese or chocolate. If you take these things into consideration and can get other fondue accesories I would not hesitiate buying this set as it is very stylish."
3,Frustrated in Florida,"It may not take a rocket scientist to figure out how to use this fondue set, but a few, simple instructions would have been nice. I registered for another fondue set....which came with instructions....on my bridal registry at Target. I was excited to see that someone had upgraded my gift to the Michael Graves set, but was very frustrated when I found no instructions. I've dined at fondue restaraunts, but never prepared it myself, and would have appreciated a few, simple instructions. My husband went to the Michael Graves website and emailed them about the problem. They were quick to respond, and mailed us a set of instructions. :)"
5,I JUST THINK THE CD KCI&JOJO IS THE BOMB.,"The cd Kci&JoJo is really neat.I love the song ALL MY LIFE.That song reminds me of a dog I used to have named pooch.I loved her so much.She was like a member of are family.Iam so Thankful that,that cd came out.The cd inspired me a whole bunch.If you read this e-mail me sometime.My name is Brittney O'Donnell im from Ohio and im 12 years old. C-ya"
3,lynn,"Heello... At the first time i heard this song, i really attracted by the song melody and the lyrics. 'All My Life' is really a 'touching' love song. Subarashi."
4,Washable filter,Filter is well constructed.cleaning is easy and straight forward.filters hold up far beter than nonwashable.Filters trap at least as many fine particles as nonwashable
2,You couldn't pick a better title,"This is just crap!!!! I own their other cd's and this just made my ears bleed from the pain. Out of tune, the vocals just suck, the keys are just out there, the guitar you can't hear it and the drums just make noise. I made better music when I was 3 yrs old banging on the pots and pans in the kitchen I use to dig out of the cuboards."
4,modern award stickers,"These stickers are a little more modern than some of the other Dover sticker books. It is a small size with a few pages of stickers. They are nice to use, and a good source of getting jsut a few stickers."
5,FiestyTee,"I think Bobby Womack is one sexy brother. I always liked his song ""A Woman Got To Have It"", but of course I was born in 1961. Watching this concert made me realize what I had been missing. I have watched this live concert atleast 10 times already. He is my mid-night fire on Friday nights after all long working week."
1,Very Poor Performance!,"I have been a Bobby Womack fan since the 1970s, and unfortunately I have to say this is one of his worst performances. First of all, Bobby acted like he was so tired of his own material that he didn't even feel like performing any it. As a matter-of-fact, he preferred to talk to the audience for at least half of most of the songs he half performed, singing only three or four versus from a song. His vocal performance of course was not optimal, however considering his age it was acceptable, if he had only elected to sing the songs rather than talk through them. If I had paid for a ticket, I would request a refund. Don't waste your time or your money on this concert, unless you are so much of a Bobby Womack diehard fan that you really don't care whether he sings or not. In that case, perhaps you will enjoy his self-indulgent conversation throughout the concert."
5,Bobby Womack Live,I really enjoyed it. Bobby Womack sounds great and sung every song through. Thanks Bobby for so much good music! Cheryl/OKC
2,good price... very poor packaging,way too many dented cans - they really need to pack it better - inexcusable!
1,Audio Clips,"LOL, all these audio sample clips are of a Mexican Band.At first i was saying, What is trower doing now? lol"
3,I Expected Far Better From A Jack Bruce/Robin Trower Collaboration,"Robin Trower's Bridge Of Sighs is one of my favorite 1970s albums and I've enjoyed Jack Bruce's work with Cream since I first heard it in the late 1960s. So when I saw this 1980s collaboration between Trower and Bruce I expected great things. I was somewhat disappointed when I played it. This album is OK but I really expected better things from a Robin Trower/Jack Bruce collaboration.Having said that, check out Jack Bruce and Robin Trower's Seven Moons Live. Now that's a great Bruce & Trower album. I give 5 enthusiastic stars for Seven Moons Live. But only 3 stars for this one."
3,Marginally effective...,"Marginally effective ghost story spoilt by disappointing ending. Has been likened to The Ring, but other than the appearance of the ghost, it bears little resemblance. Francis Ng plays a drama teacher with an uncanny interest in the supernatural, and when some people starts dying after a seance, he gets involved. A Wicked Ghost involves (expectedly) an unkind female ghost and some cheesy plotting (killings that would not end); some of the plot makes no sense, other parts seem very contrived, but if it's atmosphere that you're looking for, there's plenty of hair blown about and self-inflicted gore. Effective while it lasts, then forgettable afterwards."
3,"Refreshing, Just Avoid Your Privates","This is a refreshing shower gel until it gets into your ""privates,"" then it burns like crazy. I mean, ""pepper-"" mint is a very significant name AND descriptor for the essential oils in this shower gel. I no longer use it for my shower, but it's fabulous for soaking feet after a long day."
1,Do not buy this...trust me...,"Well...this is one of tha worst hip hop movies ever, and the title Hip Hop 2000 really tricked me into buying this DVD. It's a low, low, MAN so LOW quality on image and sound, you really wonder why this is released internationally. The editing is really, really poor to, heard me. ICE T is maby a big personality in the world of hip hop, but he got no skills and ain't keepin' it real for nuthin. The interviews are a little interesting, a little, but apart from it, this is a movie which purpose (giving us a look inside the underground world of hiphop, and how [stuff] really goes down) has really failed. I got it....and regret it. Don't do the same thing."
1,CD instead of Food,"By now the mistake has been solved but instead of the food I received a CD? Have to send the CD back, my money is being transferred back and no Kohinoor Food, but hey.. accidents happen ;-)"
2,A Posteriori,"Not as good and creative videos as Enigma usually has. Unless you meditate a lot, it doesn't have artistic value."
4,Enigma Today,"Enigma are known for a particular style of music, usually pigeonholed under the ""New Age"" banner, which is unfair. Their music has evolved over the years, whilst staying true to the Enigma style.The DVD has the entire album, and single remixes accompanied by Kalaediscopic and Space themed visuals, and a superb DTS or Dolby 5.1 soundtrack.While the visuals grow a little tired after a while, the music is superb, with Enigmas usually lovely melodies. A Posteriori is a more dance oriented album than say MCMXC AD, but is none the worse for it."
5,"Kaleidoscope scenes, and Great 5.1 surround!!!","Great kalleidoscope effects and the 5.1 surround turns the listening a new experience very different of the normal sound of the cd album, and some tracks (2) appearing different mixed. Great sound!"
3,"Great music, so-so video","Great music, as I expect of all Enigma material. However, the video mostly consists of synchronized geometrics and electric kaleidoscope patterns, not too unlike some of the visualizations in Windows Media Player or Winamp. Considering some of Enigma's past video work, there could have been more to this."
3,"Eh, too much of the same thing","I love Enigma's music and have enjoyed the DVD releases that go with albums but I am going to have to agree that this one was lacking. It was novel on a few tracks, the kaleidoscope worked well for ""Dreaming of Andromeda"" but it got real old, real fast. My cats, however, loved it. I wandered off after a while but one of them sat there and watched it from start to finish - amusing for that aspect. It felt like watching a visualization on a computer's media player. But even those change in presentation or at least pulse in time with the music.If you're a die-hard fan and seek to add everyhing Enigma to your collection, this will fill the spot but as for replay value there isn't much reason to sit down and watch it from start to finish."
2,"Disappointing Imagery, great music.","I have always loved the music of Enigma. I have had Mcmxc A.D. since shortly after it's release and still listen to it often. When I saw a few videos on YouTube I searched for the DVD's. I bought all 4 of them.The other DVD's have great imagery that keep you captivated while listening t great music. This DVD does not deliver that. The imagery on it looks no better than a High School student doing an AV project while high on drugs. It reminded me of looking through a kaleidoscope at posters of space and strange imagery.The music is still stellar ad that is why the 2 stars. As for the DVD imagery, save your money and buy the CD. It will save you the deflation of having to watch this. The others in the set are definate 5 star, not even close."
2,Meh,"Michael Cretu has made some invigorating music in the past. However, any talent he has in music obviously doesn't translate into video releases. A Posteriori's DVD is a real snoozefest. Visually, it doesn't show anything but kaleidoscopic patterns. Within two minutes, you've already seen all you care to see. Not to mention that the video is based on one of Enigma's most boring and repetitive albums, and you now have every reason to pass on this one. Now all this COULD be saved by the 5.1 surround mix, but that's also a dud. The sound mix resembles more of an ""enhanced stereo"". Then on top of that, the DVD isn't in any kind of anamorphic widescreen, and the visual quality is extremely low.This is, simply put, a waste of money."
4,GREAT MATERIAL,"hi everybody,i recommend this GREAT MATERIAL,one of the best if not the BEST of Enigma,the dvd contains an interviuw with Michael Cretu the soul behind this ""PROYECT"", a new version of 3 themes, Feel me Heaven,sounds variations in Message from 10,and vocals variations in Sitting on the Moon,the visualisations are not to good to be honest,but the sound un DTS is WONDERFULL, enjoy with eyes close. Healt and Life, Geo."
2,Psychodelic music,"I like collecting concert DVDs of groups whose music I prefer. After listening to some short excerpts of Enigma's music, I decided to purchase this DVD. However; instead of a DVD showing the band playing, you find yourself viewing what appears to be a kalideoscopic view accompanied by somewhat monotonous music. I wouldn't have purchased it had I known the content."
5,Perfect training for beginners,"A very simple device for anyone wanting to learn or to improve their picture taking skills. Very good for composition, lens selection, and the use of color to create interest or to have the eyes go to the point you are trying to direct the viewers' attention. Too bad Canon has not followed up on this type of learning."
4,Must read for students if the civil rights movement,"If you are a student of the civil rights movement in particular or the 1960s in general you must read Taylor Branch's book on Martin Luther King. The book guides you momement by moment through King's hardfought but peaceful successes at Montomery & Selma and throughout the South and as the movement moved north with less than peaceful outcomes in Watts, Detroit, New Jersey, etc. Very interesting and insightful read."
4,Attention DIANA ROSS wannabes!,"OKAY, so you're not an American Idol winner... But don't let that stop you from feeling like King or Queen of MOTOWN!! Pop in the ""DIANA ROSS: Karaoke Chartbusters"" CD and sing your way into your own music history. Or at least become a legend in your own mind. Package contains 6 songs on 12 tracks: Both the instrumental (sing-along version) and the vocal (guide version). Try sounding like Miss Ross on songs ""Take Me Higher"", ""Upside Down"", and ""Missing You."" Although Original DIANA ROSS vocals aren't featured on the CD, IT is pure FUN and a delight at parties!"
5,Bounty Hunter Gold Digger Metal Detector,"The Bounty Hunter found a very thin wire at 4 inches before it found the surveyor post 3"" under ground 3 feet over that I was looking for at the time. It was very quick and I am very pleased."
1,Doesn't work at beach,"I bought this product for a teenager as a Christmas present as he was wanting to use it at the beach and search for things. The item arrived brand new and earlier than expected. It was put together very easily and when testing it on our jewelry it works fine. However, we quickly learned this item doesn't detect anything buried even just 1-2"" below ground, if it isn't literally just below the surface, it doesn't work. I sincerely doubt my son will ever use this again and I'll probably just sell it online used and be happy if I get half my money back."
1,don't bother,"I read the other reviews that said this was an OK detector, and that was all I was looking for, something to have fun with while spending a few days at the beach.Luckily we tried it out before hauling it 800 miles to the beach. I kid you not, within 5 minutes of putting new batteries in the Metal Detector, it stopped working. I returned it the very next day."
1,dissapointing,I am very disappointed my 10 yr old daughter wanted a metal detector for Christmas and this is the one she got. It will not work does not have any sound after getting 3 new sets of batteries still nothing and now amazon will not take my return because i bought it in October i would not recommend this product
4,Cool product,"The metal detector itself is nice and my mom loves it. She goes camping and to the beach a lot so this is something she wanted. It works fine, the ONLY thing I was disappointed about was that it doesn't come in a seperate boc from what it's shipped in. I gave this to her as a gift and didn't have much ""curb appeal"" if you will."
4,Not bad but could be better,"It's an alright detector but it's not very accurate. I tested it by using an old tin can, Quarter, and a penny, tried all different settings but everything sounded exactly the same. Even used a computer to test sound frequency etc(just in case), all frequencies identical. So if you are looking for a very accurate detector this is not for you.If you want something to get started on, this will do the job."
4,Great item,My husband and I have really have enjoyed using this. It works really well and is definely worth the price..
5,great,Bought for my sons 8 th birthday and he loves it. Found .50 cents within 10 min. Works great and easy to set up within minute. Can't wait to take to the beach this summer.
3,Works OK,It works OK...my son is happy.. So I am happy. But dont expect the detector to put up anything buried in the ground very deep. It is pushing to find treasure a foot deep with this detector
2,Just ok,Just opened the box and the headphones that came with this item were already broken. I would spend a little more and get from a different buyer with better headphones. Also one of the battery compartments doesn't snap closed and have already fallen off. Guess I will be sending it back in for another one.
4,your basic beginners metal detector,So i got my detector and assembled it (very easy) and added 2 9 volt batteries and turned it on adjusted the knobs that control discrimination and power level and have found that if you play around with it enough you will notice a change in sound pitch when scanning over top of a copper penny vs a quarter one gives a low tone the other gives a high tone anyway haven't gotten a chance to do any serious metal detecting yet I am hoping though to get a chance to go to the beach and see what kind of stuff i might be able to findPros:uses 2 9 volt batteries as opposed to 8 AA batterieslightweighteasy to useCons: No volume control knob (you will need to purchase separate headphones with volume control)
1,Didn't work,Purchased as a gift. This item looked good when delivered but unfortunately didn't work for us. Couldn't detect coins in grass.
1,Bounty Hunter Gold Digger Metal Detector Failed,"I purchased this product for an 11 year old. After assembling the unit, it worked fine for approximately five minutes, then stopped operating completely. I replaced the batteries, and still nothing. Returned it."
3,Average,"This was a christmas gift for a 14 year old. Perfect gift for a kid, or a novice. I would recommend this for a teen. She loves it!!"
5,wizard gear,"this was the best gift I ever gave, it provided us with such fun and laughter..this was great..and leave it to Amazon to have just the right thing!"
1,Misleading!,"This movie did NOT feature the famous actress Doris Day, it was some other person. It should have been mentioned in the description that this was not the popular actress who starred in films with Rock Hudson, etc."
1,Totally wrong product for my car.,The site told me it was for my car... Not even close I was upset that I had to pay return fright when I did not even make a mistake.
5,The Holy Sh** Factor,"Just got this TV yesterday, and all I can say is wow. The picture is extremely bright. The setup is fairly straight forward. The size and appearance of this tv will just blow you away though. I got it set up last night, and the 4 or 5 people who were in to see it, all had the wow effect that I did the first time I saw it hooked up. Amazing TV, can't find a better picture quality, and great price too on price grabber. Ordered mine on a Thursday, and it arrived the following Wednesday.Chris"
2,Informative - but not enough,"This was an almost commercial like documentary. I would have liked more detailed info on operating strategy and boat construction. Fleet type subs have always been a passion of mine for 50 years when I tried to get in the Navy Submarine Service. Even for what I got, I will enjoy watching this set repeatedly."
5,A Must See for World War II Buffs,"The contribution of US subs to winning the Pacific war may not be well known They sunk a great percentageof the Japanese merchant fleet (down to about 1.5 million tons at the end of the war from 5-6 milliontons at the start) plus a goodly number of fighting ships. This is under appreciated probably because thevery nature of the process does not make for easy filming. A lot more detail is available in Clay Blair'sbook Silent Victory.The DVD is well done (as I expect from TMG) and attractively priced. The maps are a definite plus (asnoted elsewhere). A listing of the US subs sunk (at the DVD's end) is useful. TMG might have includeda list of all the US subs and their ""scores"" (numbers and total tonnage) in place of the PT DVD. The storyof the non-performing torpedoes at the war's beginning is a sad one and is well covered here. Onealso learns of just how dangerous the work was (24% did not return,which was greater than bombing lossesaccording to the DVD)"
4,"Good, but sloppy","All in all, this is a very good product, especially considering the price, but as someone fairly well-versed in military history in general and American World War II submarines in particular, I found there to be an awful lot of rather careless factual mistakes. The most glaring of these errors are the two misspellings of submarine names within the on-screen graphics: USS Pogie instead of USS Pogy, and USS Pompanito instead of USS Pampanito. Other mistakes include a pilot being identified as an F-6F pilot instead of an F6F pilot, the Bashi Channel being misspelled ""Bashee"" and Takao, Formosa (modern day Kaohsiung, Taiwan) being misspelled as Takow. Picking nits? Perhaps, but these were all such easy mistakes to either avoid or correct at some point, I feel that I should at least mention them."
3,Silent Victory Submarine Warfare in WWII,"Having been a ""qualified"", dolfin awarded, member of the United States submarine service, this history is close to my heart. I have read many books on submarine warfare including Clay Blair's Silent Victory. I found the movie interesting if only somewhat lacking in details. It was great to see interviews of some of the men that I held in high reguard as a young submarine sailor in the early seventies. These men ships(boats) and crews deserve all the great stories by them and about them. It seems so sad that we're losing them at such a rapid rate. I hope this documentary and other films I hope will follow, will help insure their true exploits will be remembered in our future generations. Once the truth is unfurled everything else is just a streamer."
4,Cel Damage rocks,"Cel Damage has cartoony grafics. The controls are a little different, but you'll get used to them. Cinder the Chaotic Devil is hilarious. His intro movie will blow you away. Cel Damage is very fun. My favorite thing to do is pick up Cinder's Wood Chipper(shredder) and mow them like grass. If you love driving around way to fast and killing everything in sight you'll love this game."
5,You are futile to the powers of this game,"This game is amazing. First off, if you like the Twisted Metal games, this is mostly the same concept. You get to go around in your cool little cartoon car and kill people with spectacular weaponry. I would say this game is best played as a multiplayer game, I spent two weekends in a row playing this bad boy. If you do play it one player, it can get boring, but with multi-player the fun is all there."
3,"Mindless fun, but that's about it","First, the good news, this game has awesome cel shaded graphics and excellent control. It plays like a looney toons cartoon. But that's about all it has going for it. No depth to the gameplay, just mindless, but fun, destruction. Fun for about a half hour, maybe more if you play with a friend. Worth a weekend rental, but not a purchase."
2,Bad for 13+ yrs,"This game is very childish and best suited for fans of Pokemon and Paper Mario. Also, the camera angles are horrible which makes the game near to impossible to play. It is beyond me why someone would buy it. However, renting would be a good idea!"
2,One of the worst games for the cube!,"I rented this for my XBOX, and boy does it stink! There is asolutely no way that I am gettin' this for my gamecube! The graphics are very lame, very cartoonish, the sound is very weak and the only reason I gave the game 2 stars was because of the originality! No one else would have thought of a game similar to this garbage. Gamecube shouldn't even be getting this game! The cars are very slow and it is more exagerated than extreme G3 with all of those weapons and arm thingys coming out of the roof of the trucks or cars. The game is too fake. I'd rather settle for Wave Race: Bluestorm, a more realistic, at least a more sane game than Cel Damage. If you know whats good for you and your precious money, do not get this game. Trust Me, you will regret it.-gAMEmASTER jASON"
5,"Everyone, break out your cash because this is a MUST HAVE!!","I have only played this game twice at my friend's house and now I beg everyone for it!This is the craziest, most fun game I have ever played!I'd give this game more stars if I could but, I woudn't reccomend this game for kids under 10."
4,"Cel Damage, Tonight @ 8","I have this game and its pretty fun. It has the most cartoonish style ive ever seen in a game and one of the funniest ive played.Battle all kinds of ""things"" including using oversized axes, bats,shredders, and saw blades. Its very fun!"
4,A wonderful satire,"I haven't read all of the stories yet, however the ones I have read are very good. Carey has excellent prose, and the themes and ideas behind his stories are very interesting. That alone makes it well worth reading. However, as a satire, The Fat Man in History says a lot about our world,and is definitely worth considering for any literary enthusiast."
1,"Where is ""Crabs"" !?","According to multiple book review sites and online booksellers, the early Carey short story ""Crabs"" is included. ([...]). So, why are there only 10 stories and not 12? And why is ""Crabs"" not included? I've wanted to read it ever since watching the low-budget flick it inspired, ""Dead End Drive In"". I wasted my money on this rip-off."
3,Slightly Disappointed in 4th Ed.,"I love materials science and as a bibliophile I anticipated the release this new edition for months. Surely for that price and the 15 year interim since the last edition, I expected a grand volume updated with multicolored illustrations, supplementary sidebars, interactive CD, example problems - sometime suitable for bedtime reading at my wife's side. But alas.Well, at least the 4th Ed. has a nicer cover, and some of the typos were corrected. The content is still excellent even though the authors had the audacity to omit two chapters on fracture mechanics ""to increase the focus of the text"" - okay.My advise: Buy the 3rd edition instead. You'll be getting more for less."
2,Cool duck call -hard to use!,"I bought this for my 13 year old son for Christmas (he loves Duck Dynasty!), and he is STILL trying to figure out how to make the mallard duck sound. Still funny to hear him try!"
3,not my fave,"this book was ok but it was missing something. the thing that got me the most was the way the kids talked. i'm in 8th grade and i don't talk like that. i mean who says peace out anymore? overall i thought it was a good book, but i have other books i'd rather read."
3,Double Dutch,"I am a middle school Language Arts teacher who teaches high-level eighth grade students (in other words, VERY smart, motivated, and voracious readers). I suspect that when Sharon Draper was a teacher, she taught some lower-level students because this book seems to be clearly geared towards those students.The author can write, but I feel this particular work is not challenging, as everything seems to be over-explained, and, though heartfelt, relatively two-dimensional. When each major character harbors a Secret, and through a series of incidents where all the Secrets are revealed, these Secrets don't meet up with deeper intellectual meaning. In short, I find both plot and character exist in the world of Afterschool Specials -- simple, over-explained and highly coincidental.Many kids will enjoy this book, but mine will not."
4,DOUBLE DUTCH by S. F.,I am a member of SOUTHWOOD BOOK. And this book was discuss in April 2003. I really enjoyed this book.Dennis a 'WILDCAT'
1,"Poor value, inadequate content","Over twenty bucks for 62 minutes of disjointed coverage. For each of these battles, which went on for years, you get fifteen to twenty minutes of interviews played over clips of the riders and the racing. Very very short clips, two seconds here, five seconds there. Many of them are things like photo ops and slow motion of one of the guys sitting there doing nothing. What a RIP OFF!!! I watched many of these races live and I hoped they'd at least show a representative bit of racing between each of the pairs, but they never show enough of even one lap to give you an idea of how these guys actually compared. My impression from watching Mick and Alex every year, every race, was that Alex only won when he ambushed Mich and once Mick was on to his technique that didn't happen again. Mick even complained about it after the first time he did it. Not mentioned in this video.Do yourself a favor, buy a Duke video instead, much better value and much better made."
2,head to head,"It looks like the marketing boys that control the motogp organization were looking for a way to make some extra money for the coming 2007 season and the start of 800cc premiere class by dreaming up this silly excuse of a dvd, the racing footage was mediorce and the context of the rivalry insipid. Nice seeing the two-stroke 500cc bikes!"
5,Very pleased,One of the best MotoGP DVD's out there. I've watched it 3 times already. Very good insite into each racers history.
3,"okay, could be better","I purchased this as a science curriculum for my homeschooled kindergartener. Granted, there aren't many preschool/kindergarten science curricula out there. I based it on SWB's rec in the Well Trained Mind. This is written for pre-school teachers with many children, not homeschoolers with only one or two children. Most activities are set up for a group, and must be adapted. Not all needed materials are easily obtained items - one activity requires you to ""borrow"" x-rays of broken bones from a dr's office. (you can probably find pictures of them online - but that's not what the lesson says.)We're doing some of the activities - and I've ordered ""real science 4kids"" pre-level 1 chemistry. (which I only learned about after ordering this book.)"
4,Home Movies Continues and Ends Its Excellence,"Season Four of Home Movies is everything we've come to expect from the show and then some. Brendon, Melissa, and Jason are in top form, and each member of the trio truly begins to grow in this collection. The episodes pull further and further away from the actual movie-making aspect, showing just how the characters have changed over the seasons. While this may be off-putting at first, don't let it fool you; each episode is unique in its own right and just as entertaining as the previous installations.Included is a CD containing 52 music tracks from the show... basically every song Brendon Small composed for Home Movies. It's definitely a nice bonus to an already worthwhile set, and allows any fan to reminisce about a series s/he loved.Overall, this DVD set's definitely worth owning. From the Film Camp first episode to the symbolic ending in the finale, any fan of the show should own this collection."
5,Awesome show,"Home Movies is one of a few shows (along with Futurama) that just gets more hilarious the more I watch it. This is one of the best seasons too--the episode with guest stars They Might Be Giants is especially fun. The included CD with music from the show is a great extra. It's just too bad is was cancelled, I wish there was more!"
5,"Hilarious, Excellent!","Home Movies, all 4 seasons are sooooo FUNNY!I wish there were 10 seasons...excellent price as well.THANK YOU AGAIN AMAZON!!!"
5,Wonderful first loom,"My daughter received this loom as a gift for her 6th birthday. Even though the box says for ages 7 and up, and even though she's not the most nimble-fingered kid, she has no trouble using this loom with just a little help. The materials seem to be high quality and it comes with a good amount of thick, colorful yarn. The loom has been keeping my daughter happily occupied for long periods of time. She enjoys watching me knit, but doesn't have the dexterity yet to knit herself, so she's thrilled to be able to weave herself scarves and the like."
1,Spa Cloth,This cloth is too rough for facial use but is fine for the rest of the body as long as sensitive skin is not an issue. I bought it for facial use but can't use it for my face due to the abrasive texture of this product.
1,Not as good as they say...,I was disappointed.First it was quite narrow and hard to really scrub the back.Second it wasn't as exfoliating as they claim.Quite expensive for a 'wash cloth' and not much more.I went back to the old Nylon Cloth.
1,This Books Is a Big Dissapointment,Nothing but lies and totally ridiculous plot. This author would have done better writting science fiction
5,Can't beat the price.,"I love amazon, but for auto parts I do try to shop local. But when the two parts stores in town had these ball joints for $35 more a piece than amazon, it was a no brainer. My mechanic, who lets me bring my own parts, said these were a great OEM replacement for my 2004 Dakota. I like the fact that I can grease them again (Couldn't with OEM). If you need ball joints for a Dakota or Durango, definitely get these and get them here."
4,"Great overview, but you'll need a more detailed guide","The colorful photos and diagrams found in the DK travel books are a big plus for some and a major detraction for others. Personally I think this is a great book to use while making preliminary travel plans because it's very difficult to decide where to go if you can't see pictures of it first. Then once you narrow down your choices you'll want a more comprehensive travel guide, such as the Lonely Planet guides, which contain better maps, travel information, hotels, etc, but which have very few photos. I'm holding off on giving this book 5 stars because it lacks that kind of detail. However, I still pull it off my shelf frequently when I want to look up someplace on the Greek mainland I have not visited before."
2,love the photos but it needs more maps,"On a 10-day driving trip around mainland Greece this guide proved a disappointment. There aren't enough city maps so you need to buy a Lonely Planet guide as well. I love the DK guides to London and Paris where the neighborhoods and sights are so intricate that the DK diagrams and walking tours are immensely helpful. The restaurant recommendations turned out to be rather poor from the DK guide. Frommer's and Lonely Planet were a lot more reliable.If you want a guide that will help you sort out what's worth seeing, try the Michelin Neos instead."
2,dartboard cabinet,The product had fast shipping. when I was preping for install I noticed the screws in door hinges were striped and wood was split from overtighting.
2,Not as pictured,"The color is not as shown. It looks like cherry not walnut. There is no bottom door as shown. The two doors extend fully to the bottom. There was no door knobs included, so you have to get your own door pulls and drill holes for them yourself. The doors on my unit did not align properly."
2,"Nice cabinet, colors are way off.","Very nice cabinet and well constructed. Don't purchase based on their color descriptions though. Bought the mahogany one and it isn't even close, it's cherry. Very dissapointing."
3,"""Lou Rawls great... sound balance average""","Anyone who loves Lou Rawls - well it's all here. I bought this DVD from amazon from Australia as a real Lou Rawls fan having owned some of his top recordings for years. I am a great fan of his ""VOICE"" but I sadly feel his voice is not forward enough in the sound balance. The back up group are all there in detail but Lou's voice gets drowned at times and seems to have been recorded from a remote mike... However still a good atmosphere etc and a close glimpse of the man.."
3,Great performance!,"The video is not great, but Lou Rawls showed how to get the audience. I bought it to have a piece of his works."
5,Beautiful book,"Well written, well assembled, beautiful reproductions of the posters. I bought it for the Leslie Ragan images (there are more than a dozen!) but discovered much more. I appreciated that no picture takes up more than a page (it's always distracting when pictures get spread across two pages). In the writing, I would have preferred more about some of the actual trains and less about advertising history. But the writing is informative and clear."
5,Stunningly perfect book,"This book is well written with a touching, gripping, water tight plot. The feelings are so real, the humor is so genuine, I cannot praise it enough."
5,A wonderful Book,"'Flavours of the Street: Turkey' is a very good book for those who like good food and cooking. It not only gives useful recipes but also tells about the commercial life in the streets of this colourful country. The recipes are easy to do, the pictures are mouth-watering and the food look delicious. The book as a whole gives one the wish to go to the kitchen and try the recipes and makes one feel the joy of life through cooking."
2,Tin ear,"Scruton is weakest when attempting to dismiss huge swathes of contemporary music by judging it according to the very different norms of very different music, sealed off from the difficulties of encountering pluralistic societies, of the past. It's hard not to conclude that Scruton is simply not very perceptive about music generally if he can get popular music so very wrong, or worse, is racist in his dismissal of ways of being musical that derive from non-white cultures."
2,Not the best,"I love George Strait's music.If you look at my profile you will see that I have rated numerouse other cd's of his and gave them all 5 star. He is my favorite artist, but this cd is just plain bad."
5,this is a wonderful cd,George Strait has one of the best christmas albums around.I would definetely reccomend it to anyone.
5,Love It,I am finishing my collection of Jonny Quest dvd and vhs and this was one that I could not have done without. It was sent fast and I have already viewed it several times.
2,No growling for this kitty,"I'm a huge fan of rockabilly and psychobilly and this album, unfortunately, is sub-par compared to most other contemporaries. Ms. Younger sings flat on several tunes, at least one song seems a bit off beat, and her singing rhythm is rather awkward. I think she's a fan of this style of music and had enough money to put out an album.We haven't heard anything from her in a while and I hope it's because she's getting some singing and performance lessons.Go get some Kim Lentz, Rosie Flores, or Wanda Jackson."
4,Wanda Jackson she's not !,"I have listened several time to the Dulcie Younger CD that I purchased from Amazon and I don't think that this music can stand up to the real Female Rockabilly sounds like used to be sang by the likes of Wanda Jackson. Don't get me wrong , the guitar lead is second to none, but the words and singing get somewhat corny. If I had it to do over I would of spent my hard earned money on a sure thing not a Rockabilly want a be! Add a few bucks to what you would of spent on this CD and buy a copy of the CD BOX SET / Right or Wrong by Wanda Jackson. It cost a little more but you are getting the ""Real Thing""! Enjoy"
4,Portable fun for an RTS fan,"I would buy this game, but ONLY if you like real time strategy games. Don't look at just the stars for some of those 1 star reviews, because those complaints could be said about any RTS game. Ok so the AI could be a little dumb sometimes, but that is what a link mode is for and yes the missions could be better.If you don't like the genre, don't buy the game, If you like the genre, go ahead and buy it"
1,Save your money,"I love to see more strategy games developed for the GBA but this one doesn't hit the mark. Very restrictive game play. Missions are short and easy. Little or no AI, enemy units simply sit there until you walk up and shoot them. Over complicated menus. Average graphics. Terrible sound track and very poor sound effects. Mech Platoon was a big disappointment. I'm going to dust off Advance Wars and wait for the next one."
2,LOOKS!,THIS GAME JUST LOOKS COOL noone has really played it yet so all we can say is LOOKS so dont listen to the reviews yet!
1,ouch!!!,This game obviously offers a large amount of promise being the first real time game for GBA. I fully anticipated this games arrival at my local stores and bought it the day it came out. However i was sadly and quickly dissapointed. The AI in the game is horribly slow. It holds back the extremely great concepts that are intended for the game. The slowness has held me back from compeleting so many missions that i have quit playing the game all together becuase it's more annoying when you have to fight the HORRIBLE AI instead of the enemy.
5,FANTASTIC VISUALS!!,"""Destiny"" shows how early Fritz Lang developed his amazing visual style, which would reach its peak with his two-part ""Die Nibelungen"" (1924). Even such a prosaic setting as a village tavern catches the eye with its detail and scene composition. An appropriate score adds to the visual impact.The casting is likewise appropriate, especially Bernhard Goetzke, with his gaunt chiseled features and languid look. Many filmmakers were impressed and inspired by this masterwork, including Douglas Fairbanks, whose ""The Thief of Bagdad"" drew much from it.For fans of fantasy and silent German film, this is a must-have DVD, with its sharp image and color tinting. It is also 20 minutes longer than the VHS version I had for many years."
4,Best print I've seen of this one.,"I've only ever found really poor quality, often chopped up versions of this early Lang film (Der Mude Tod is original title), but this DVD looks fantastic. The film itself is pretty unique, worth watching, but not a masterpiece, especially in light of Lang's other achievements. The music by the Mont Alto Orchestra is well done - I saw these guys perform live to Harold Lloyd's ""Kid Brother"" and they did a great job. Check 'em out live if you can!"
4,A wonderful story of love vs. Death,"I bought this movie on a whim.I knew of Fritz Lang and I am a fan of silent films so I thought I'd take a chance on this.I'm glad I did,This is a wonderful movie, and the visual effects for a film that is over 80 years old are impressive.The three sub-stories, where the heroine tried to win back the life of her fiance, are sad and unique from each other.I'm giving this film 4-stars.I was disappointed that there was no film history information or discussion on this DVD. I thought that the Image Entertainment release would include this, but I guess they didn't think it was necessary. Oh well.Otherwise an outstanding film and in great condition, considering it's age."
3,"Good memories but little ""real"" content","This is a fun picture book that walks us down memory lane for this cult classic. The outrageous costumes and make up are fantastic. There are a few excerpts from the various shows, but many are handwritten and not easy to read. I think they could have added more ""real"" content, like detailed biographies of the cast members and some trivia facts about the episodes.Die hard fans should love this, but they'll still feel something was a bit missing."
2,Fun Book,This book is comprised of loads of Polaroids used to ensure hair/makeup/costume continuity (hence the name)during scene shoots of AbFab. They provide a rare inside glimpse of the cast in between shots. Fun book--Jennifer Saunders (GENIOUS!!!) gives bits of narration throughout (although it is sometimes very difficult to read her handwriting!!). A must-have for die-hard fans. Great conversation/coffee table piece!
5,Wonderful book for those of us from southwest Virginia!,"This book gives a glimpse of the correspondence between Robert E. Lee and his wife and daughters. As a Virginian, it was even more personal to read about the areas of the state where his family travelled to escape the ravages of the war and to know that these are still beautiful sites, worth visiting even today. It was a poignant look at this great general's love for his family."
4,it help me clean 10 year old caps,It did a nice job on difficult stops. It work well on sweat spots on light colors but on dark and black hots it did cause a slight fade.
3,Cap Cleaner okay,"It didn't work as well as I had hoped. There are still a couple stains on the hat, but it is generally clean. Probably good for just plain cleaning, not so much for stains."
1,Cap Cleaner And Deodorizer,"Didn't find useful. I was trying to clean off the sweat ring off my tan cap following the direction all the way, but it did nothing to rid it. I finally used Resolve Foam and it took the ring out quickly."
4,Keep one in your car!,"My son and I have really enjoyed this travel chess set. It is small and easy to transport. Perfect for travel. We keep ours in the car so we can pass the time waiting for appointments, etc. Pieces are easy to move around the board yet fit tight enough not to fall out. I would have liked the little zipper storage compartment to face the other way to make it easier to get the pieces in and out. The only other fault is that the silver and gold pieces don't have much color contrast and it is sometimes difficult to tell the pieces apart, especially in the bright sun. Black and white pieces would have worked better."
3,sideways board,"Yes, the board is sideways but... It is only glued in so I merely pulled the board off the case so it's no longer attatched, a situation I personally like better anyway. If your really intent on having the board attatched to the case you could reglue it back on... This is the only travel chess set I have owned so I have nothing to compare it to, but, it works and is perfectly functional. One minor peeve is that the bishops look awfully close in shape and size to the queen, but you can probabaly just deal with that. 5 stars for fun, but I guess you have to enjoy chess first! As a note, my favorite use for a small travel size set is after playing a game online, I can e-mail myself the moves from a game, and go over my moves quickly and convienently in front of my computer to see where I made mistakes."
1,Crappy set,"Really, this isn't worth your money at all and I regret spending my money on it. The bad: 1) The color of pieces are too alike to be able to distinguish with any ease. I have to hold it up to the light to see who is what. 2) Paint on pieces comes off easily. Now there is paint all over on the inside of the plastic compartment. Now it looks really crappy. 3) Paint on board comes off easily. 4) Perhaps this should be number one; the board is turned the wrong way. I had to peel it off and turn it the correct way.The good? Not much. It is a small sized peg chess set, which is what I wanted, but I've had to rebuild/repaint the set to make it usable, and even then I just gave it away because I was so mad about it. Not a good buy for your money. Get the Chess- by Family Games peg set instead. It's about the same size and price and so far has great reviews. Or better yet, get the Drueke magnetic travel set in a box. Slightly larger and about twice the cost, but well worth it."
4,Exciting story,"I have read Michele Albret's first two novels, that is why I just got this one when it came out.This was a good book as well. It had entertaining characters and an interesting plot. It left you guessing as to who the bad guy was, I was completly surprised.Cassie is a strong independent woman who know herself. Alex is a strong man who know what he wants and is not overbearing.My favorite book by Michele is Getting Her Man and I still think it is the best. This was really good. Recommended."
3,A GENEROUS 3 STARS,"Well, it looks like I might be the only one who was disappointed in Ms. Albert's ONE WAY OUT. I've read and enjoyed all her books but this one just didn't do it for me. I'm not sure why. The characters were okay; the plot was okay; the action was okay. Wait a minute! I think I see a pattern here. Nothing was great, just okay. I got the impression Ms. Albert's publisher was waiting on her latest so she just dashed this one off. This one is not going on the keeper shelf."
3,Very Average,"I'm sorry but this book is not as good as some reviews might indicate. There story line is common, the writing adequate and the suspense nil. However, what really amazes me is that an author who studied archeology in college cannot adequately describe the field or evoke the feelings of her characters about their trade. This is my first time reading Michele Albert and I'm not impressed."
3,Light Reading at best...,"Born of Elven Blood was an okay book, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it. Alot of it seemed rather cliched, and the writing style just wasn't that compelling. The characters and the world of Faery are likeable enough, but rather dull compared to all the other great fantasy books out there! To sum it all up, if you are looking for a great novel that will keep you hooked and last more than an hour, read something else."
1,Should be called a phrase book,"Colloquial Navajo is a a bit of a disappointment. It is comprised primarily of two lists: English phrases translated into the Navajo language and then Navajo phrases translated into English. To be fair, there is a brief introductory section that attempts to shed some light on verb tenses. But there is only the scantiest mention of the numerous Navajo pronouns and no explanation at all of how senteces are properly formed. There are lots of examples, but no rules of grammer. All in all, I found the book less helpful than I had hoped it would be. The language of the Navajos is extremely complex. Perhaps no one book could ever provide all the help needed to begin to master it."
3,"Dictionary of IDIOMATIC expressions, nothing more","as above, it serves its purpose if that's what you want"
3,be careful when selecting size,Picking the right size for me and the type of exercises I wanted to use the superband for was a shot in the dark. I ended up picking a size that is not that most effective. There are other bands like this outside of amazon that give you more information on how to pick the right size for your goals so you may want to keep looking.
4,They arrived in good condition.,"The wings are perfect for my fairy costume. They have white elastic straps which show on my coordinating blue dress, but I don't mind."
4,two cultures,This was a fantastic look at what happened to some Japanese in the this country during WWII and what happened to an American woman in Japan. I believe it was an honest account of events that actually transpired. It was a very moving book.
5,Great read,"Well written,gripping at times..really enjoyable...would definitely recommend to Lesley Pearce fans...a great read..wish I had met Hope..what a great character!!"
5,Loved this!,"Have only just recently discovered Lesley Pearse but she is a wonderful story teller, so much so that it's hard to put the book down once you start reading it!! This has been one of the best books I've read recently with poor Hope never getting an easy time of it but she manages to persevere. It's the rougher side of the 'Downton Abbey era' that we scarcely see!"
5,Really good product,Takes a little getting used to and the mirror gets in the way of my sun visor. It gives a realy wide view. I would also try the rectangle shaped spots for your outside mirrors. The first mirror I purchased arrived broken but the customer service was exceptional and they sent a new one right away.
3,Good product but needs care while installing,"I purchased this product last week and it was delivered by Amazon pretty quickly. Its a very useful product but requires care while installing it, I tried installing it but it did not fit correctly so I went to my Car dealer and he fixed it for me at no cost. Now I am happy and this really eliminates all blind spots.May be I would have preferred something which clips on my existing mirror, nevertheless this is sturdy and is extremely useful while driving."
1,Disappointing,I'm not sure if it is because it is positioned incorrectly or because I just cannot get used to the view...but I just don't like it.
2,not the right color nickel,The listing has a description as brushed nickel and it isn't anything like other Grohe products we have installed...needs to be returned.
1,Failed spectacularly after 5 showers,After one week of light use the hose started spraying water wildly from water pipe joint.What a terrible piece of Made in China junk masquerading as a German product.I'm staying away from all Grohe products.
2,PU!,"This show stinks! I am a *huge* fan of animated shows, so when I saw this show that I'd never heard of -- with its intriguing title -- I couldn't wait to check it out. They were right to put this show to sleep. The premise and characters were great, but somehow, the writers could not punch up the scripts enough to make it worth my while. (The Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy and American Dad must have spoiled me...)"
5,The Best Show Ever Besides The O.C.,I love this show and I loved it when it first aired. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that it's only 13 episodes long.... I want more!!!!
3,Not what I expected,I was expecting more of a trivia type book but the art student I bought it for enjoyed it anyway.
5,Great CD,"TRACKS: Uptown Top Ranking, It mek, Ram goat liver, Return of Django, Reggae in your jeggae, Let your yeah be yeah, Young, gifted and black, Wet dream, Wreck a buddy, Liquidator, Rivers of Babylon, Johnny Too Bad, 0.0.7.

4,leather handbag,purse is great and looks good. A little heavier than I anticipated but overall really nice.
3,"Good over view, but lacking in depth.","In this work by Mr. Kung attempts to give an overview of the history of Christian thought. As is the case with any overview, it tends to lack depth due to the immense scope of the project, so it seems one cannot really fault him on that account. But near the end of the book, Kung seems to get too attached to that last figure, Barth. In his discussion of Barth, Kung takes too much liberty with his own personal convictions about Barth, and seems to skew the portrayal. This is not the case in the earlier discussions of Origen through Luther. One can see the onset of this personalization in the discussion of Schleiermacher. Overall I would rate this an adequate overview, especially the discussions of the earlier figures in which Kung does make some interesting comments."
3,Bright Light Bright Light,"Over all the clock is a good buy. The only reason I'm writing this is for those of you who are light sleepers, the display is bright. In some pictures it looks red but is in fact orange. Hope this helps."
1,Great clock -- awful radio,The clock does a wonderful job and is easy to read without my glasses in the middle of the night. The sound from the radio will certainly awaken you but the sound quality is at best poor. After a month we moved this to a guest bedroom and replaced it with another clock radio.
1,Disappointed.,"Just received my clock a short while ago and was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I believe it is defective. The alarm, in either buzz or radio position only turns onfor about 10 secs. and then goes off. The book says it should stay for 1 hr. unless turned off. 2nd. The buzzer volume is so low, I just heard it with me ear right nextto the set. I guess I will find out how good the return's group is......a real shame, since this had all the features I liked."
4,Like this clock but............,"I really like this clock, its the second Emerson I have purchased because I really like the dual alarm function. Love the fact that I can see what times both alarms are set for without having to press any buttons. However I do agree with other reviewers that the 'wave' function is a pain. I don't like it that I turn over in my sleep and the alarm just switches off - I would rather do this manually. But even when I set the clock with the 'wave' function off it still switches off when I lift my arm to press the button on the top of the clock. I am not a morning person and without having to actually switch the clock off I will go back to sleep."
2,quirky alarm,"This product has nice features. We especially like the large clock numbers and the fact that when the alarm is turned on, the wake-up time is shown in red on the display. We have never used the radio so we cannot comment on the quality of sound and reception. Initially we had to make a manual adjustment because the automatic time set was about ten minutes fast. When the alarm goes off, it is supposed to gradually increase in volume until turned off. However, there were a few instances when the alarm would beep a few times and then automatically stop, giving the impression that the alarm never went off. This can be potentially dangerous if you do not hear the first few beeps. Although this is only an occasional occurrence, it was enough for us to render the alarm feature unreliable. Because of this, we are donating this clock to Goodwill."
2,1 yr later review,"I bought this alarm clock to replace an old one, I like the big display and the ease of use. What has started happening was the display was not lighting up the numbers anymore. What good is a clock you cant see the time on, might as well use my wrist watch. I did find something that does make me feel better, is that if you hit it, the numbers come back for a few minutes.So far, it still keeps good time, havent been late to work because of the alarm not going off. If you are thinking of purchasing this item to keep for a few years then maybe look at a different model."
3,Not completely satisfied,"This item was purchased with three needs in mind. First, my fiance and I needed a dual alarm clock. Second, we needed one with large enough numbers for him to read without his glasses. Happily, he is able to read this one easily. Lastly, we needed one with a LOUD alarm sound, or at least one that is adjustable to a loud volume. Unfortunately, this alarm would probably only suffice for the lightest of sleepers (which neither of us are).Being able to see, without moving any switches, what time the alarms are set for is nice. I just wish the alarm would wake us up when it goes off. I guess we'll be buying another new alarm clock."
3,"not bad, could be better","This clock radio has a lot of nice features, but there are also some quirks and Emerson may have a problem with quality control. Nice features: automatic time setting (but who really believes we will have the same daylight savings time system for another 100 years?), dual alarms each with 7/5/2 day settings, 2-level display that's not too bright. I thought the snooze control activated by passing one's hand in front of the clock would be nice 'til I sat up in bed and the radio shut down - it's too sensitive. Radio does not pull in very well at least the station I like to listen to.First one I got had some LED elements that did not illuminate. Amazon shipped a replacement FAST - kudos to Amazon - and the replacement had a small defect too, tho not worth pushing Amazon again. (One of the alarms won't show ""off,"" even when it is off.)"
5,Emerson Motion Sensing Clock Radio,"Excellent product for someone who just can't wake up and focus enough to hit a snooze button, but wants that extra few minutes of shut-eye. This is her second, the first was damaged accidently. Easy to read, adjustable light, and has a good alarm sound."
1,Not Reliable,"I owned the clock for two weeks. On five occasions it did a total reset to Midnight January 1, 2005. I never lost electricity and the battery was good. The customer service staff was great."
1,Sorry alarm clock,"I bought this looking for a dual alarm. This works really well, except the wave function is awful. I covered it with tape so it won't work. the problem with this radio is it will not stay on a station for any length of time if you can get one to tune in. I have exposed and stretched the cord to try to get reception. I would never recommend this to anyone. I should have sent it back. It is a piece of crap."
2,Not as good as the older model,"I purchased two older model radios about 6 years ago and they work like champs. However, they did not change to DST on the new schedule, so I decided to replace them with two of these; one for weekends and one for M-F.The alarms on the clock I set for work never went off. Very disappointing, but I was able to get it replaced. The second clock stopped altogether at 11:13. Not great when you depend upon the alarm to wak you up. I don't know if I'll be able to replace this one, but I've dragged out my old Emerson. These have been a real disappointment."
2,Sensor is too sensitive,"I've had a SmartSet clock for years and loved it, but wanted a replacement after the change in Daylight Savings Time (I went from never setting the clock to having to set it 4 times/year). This one worked fine for 2 days. On the 3rd day, the sensor apparently decided not only to snooze, but also to set the time back to midnight. Emerson's customer service (terrible) told me to manually reset it, which I did. However, when I plugged it in back in my bedroom, not only did the time reset incorrectly, the date went all the way back to 2005. Resetting a 24-hr clock was one thing, holding down the calendar buttons to push ahead 5+ years was another. I returned it (AMAZON'S customer service was great).If you take a chance on this this clock anyway, I'd suggest putting a piece of black electrical tape over the sensor before you even plug it in. Maybe if the sensor is never activated, the clock will behave as promised."
4,Great Concept,"This digital AM/FM Alarm clock radio, has great features. Large display, (day, time and alarms) wave off snooze, dual alarm with buzzer and radio, but the best feature is that it will set itself, automatically, should the power go off.The only issue I've had, is that I've had to reset the clock three times since I initially plug it in. Everything looks fine, the battery low indicator is not glowing, and it seems to be okay. However, I'll look at the clock randomly for the time and the information displayed is suddenly wrong. When I say it's wrong, I mean the day, the time, the alarms and the year are all wrong. When I called Emerson's Customer Serivce line, they could only suggest I, ""unplug it for an hour plug it back in"" and set it. If that doesn't work, bring it back.It fixed the problem, but again, I've had to do this three times.Other than that...I love it."
1,Poor quality,"I was very excited to get this clock. It does set itself automatically, which is fantastic. Also the large display meant I could read the time without putting on my glasses at night. I am severely near sighted.However the warranty is good for only 90 days and within 4 months my clock broke and started to display random times like 9:93pm. It costs $9 to have it fixed plus the cost of sending it back to them. It really isn't worth it for a $25 clock. I wouldn't recommend this item due to its poor quality."
3,Random Resetting,"For the most part this is a good alarm clock; however, there are a couple things to be aware of. The dim setting for this clock isn't all that dim. If you're a light sleeper and bright lights bother you, I wouldn't recommend this. Also, my alarm has randomly reset itself back to 12:00 am and reset the alarms to 8:00 am after hitting the snooze button."
1,Won't stay set!,"I have this clock since 31 Jul, approximately 7 seven weeks and it has cleared both alarms and jumped back to 12 Midnight 5 different times. I am not happy withit. I have had other Emerson clocks and have not had this problem."
1,Emerson Radio Stops After 6 Months,"I bought the Emerson Clock Radio with the Triple Display, because it had a lot of good features for a reasonable price. The display went Black and stopped working without any warning. The radio was only 6 months old. I have since noticed that this model is now hard to find. It appears that Emerson has stopped selling it. I will never buy any Emerson product in the future."
2,Be Carefully,This was ordered from an outside source from Amazon but through Amazon. I received a used radio and the serial number on the dog-eared box was different than the one on the radio and the display didn't work right. I will only buy products stocked by Amazon from now on.
1,Product failed,"CKS 3020 EMERSON CLOCK RADIO display became unreadable in 60 days and Emerson'scomment, a recording, ""Thank you for calling.' Don't by the new Emerson's with thenixie tube displays, or maybe anything else, they refused to respond."
2,Audio Evaluation of Emerson Clock Radio,I have two of these Clock Radios and they would be perfect except for the Audio Quality. There is serious audio distortion on all stations. Since the radio has a small speaker and a plastic case only the higher frequency sounds can be heard and for some reason the higher frequency noises are also emitted. As I said every thing else about this radio is perfect. It is unfortunate that Emerson did not consider this problem when the radio was designed.
1,Clock is a lemon,"I loved this clock for the first 45 days (also when return policy expires). It has huge numbers and I love the dual alarm. However, it decides at random times to reset itself to the wrong time and the alarms reset themselves to 8:00. This has happened numerous times in the middle of the night so my alarms do not go off when needed. It will work for a few days then go haywire once again. I think mine is just a lemon. If I knew it would work correctly, I would purchase another one so my opinion is pro & con... just saying."
2,Buyer Beware,After 3 weeks I am very disappointed with this clock. It won't hold the time settings if power goes off. I have to constantly reset it. When I go to turn the alarm off in the morning the clock resets itself to the default settings . NOT Very Happy!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Cool, not totally reliable","I bought this alarm clock as a gift. The products, I assume, are refurbished? Which is no big deal, but the first one we got did nto keep time. Seriously. We'd plug it in, the time would be correct, and two hours later, the alarm clock was like, an hour and 18 minutes fast. Totally crazy and useless. The second one works much better, but note that the time is pre-set--NOT a satellite link to the atomic clock.The ""wave"" feature for the snooze alarm is TOALLY AWESOME for non-morning people."
2,Buzzer Level Not Adjustible Model CKS3020,"The buzzer is NOT loud. Average to below average. I also agree with Quirky's rating. Sneeze on it and it might not go off. Or, it might.You take the chance. I already slept though both buzzer alarms set at highest level and 30 minutes apart. Maybe my cat touched it or a dust bunny bumped it. Whatever. It is going back.It gets 2 stars and not one because the music alarm level is LOUD.This is the model CKS3020. It doesn't say that on the Amazon description."
2,multiple failures,"The clock's display went haywire. I returned it for a replacement, which worked well for a short period of time then the buttons started to fail. One of the alarms won't be turned off.I like the features but I'm not going to try for a third to see if it will work."
3,Would have been great if tuner worked,"There were several things I loved about this clock. The amber display is easy to read, but didn't make the bedroom bright. There is a red display on the front for each alarm either showing the time the alarm is set for or if the alarm is off. You can set the alarm to go off all 7 days, weekends only, or weekdays only. The on/off button is large, raised and easy to find.Unfortunately, the radio tuner doesn't work. It couldn't bring in any stations without background static. My husband and I both like to wake to music, so I'm sending this back today. If it had a tuner that worked, this would have been a great little alarm clock."
1,Broke after one use.,"I bought this clock mainly for the auto set feature which would allow it to continue keeping time when the power has went out. This clock randomly changed time on me on 3 different occasions. I made sure that I had the correct time zone selected on the clock, but one day the clock skipped two hours ahead. The next morning it was 45 minutes behind. Total piece of junk."
2,NOT RELIABLE,"The clock has some nice features like, large display, dual alarms with visual indicator, weekday-weekend repeat alarms.The cons: The wave sensor is faulty. The alarm stops after 10 seconds and automatically goes into sleep mode.I need a reliable alarm clock and don't need gimmicks like a motion detector that can go off unknowingly or intermittently. I've returned it to Amazon and will continue my search for a dual alarm clock."
3,Emerson clock radio CKS3020,"The first one of this was just not good in any respect. The 2nd started alright but after it set self it flash went back to 2005 mode. Rather than throw out the window, I reset it manually and has work good every since. I like most of features except the sensor for snooze control.The best thing is how Amazon replace the 1st radio, I was very impress with their service.I think quality control leaves a lot to be desired."
5,Loooove this clock!,"I have to have my bedroom totally dark to be able to sleep. This little gem will show you the time when you wave your hand in front of it, then go back to dark. That alone makes it worth the purchase, but wait, there's more! To snooze you don't have to even hit the button, just wave your had at the clock and like magic, you get nine more minutes of slumbering bliss. Love it!"
1,Quirky,"I've had this clock for a year now and it just went in the trash. The volume setting never really worked right. I had to make sure I checked the volume every night before going to bed to make sure it would be audible in the morning for the alarm. For some reason the volume could vary from silent to ear bleeding. I also needed to check the station reception as the slightest bump (or not, really) could get the radio out of tune.The motion sensing snooze never really worked that well. I had to practically wave my hand in front of the thing 10 times before it would snooze.After a year of fighting with all this, the alarm stopped working and made me late for work. It had made me late in the past with random volume and radio tuning issues as well.In the trash it goes. I really don't recommend this clock."
3,Ok Clock,"This clock radio works fine as a clock or even ok as a radio. The alarm clock feature is also great since it has dual alarms, as long as you leave your alarm set at the same time all the time. The buttons on it are really stiff and you really have to push them hard to change the settings. I'm afraid that I'm going to break the clock every time I change the alarm settings because it's making a crunching sound I'm having to press it so hard. I'm on here looking for a different alarm clock at the moment because my wife doesn't like this one.I had an older Emerson clock radio that this one replaced because of them changing when daylight savings time started and it was a better built clock radio. I do like that this one has red letters instead of green like the old one. The green really lights up the room."
2,Great display - poor radio,"The display is great and large enough to see from across the room. An improvement would be to change the alarm display so it continually shows the date (now you have to find and push a button). The radio is a ten cent, single chip piece of crap. It barely picks up AM radio. When you can tune it - an on going process - there are so many whistles, whines, and static it is virtually unusable."
4,Great All-around Clock,This clock has all the features I was looking for. My biggest fettish is the ascending alarm. Most clocks don't have this feature. I don't need a loud honking sound in the morning. Being able to see what time your alarm is set for is a great bonus that no other clock has that I have found. The radio could have better reception but I don't really use it. All in all this item is well worth the price especially if your like me and can't just go buy any old alarm clock.
4,Emerson Clock Review,The Emerson clock was given to my husband for Xmas. He absolutely loves it!! It was very easy to set up and the large numbers make it real easy to see the time. The clock is very stylish and not bulky. We recommend this clock to anyone looking to upgrade their old alarm clock!
4,Emerson Smart Clock Radio,The smart clock radio was all the manufacture claimed. The clock set it self to the correct time when pulgged-in and the radio has a great sound.
1,SUPPOSED to set itself,This is fabulous if it works. In our case the date function stopped working which was okay but now it doesn't automatically set the time itself either. You can't set it yourself. Not good for day light savings folks.
1,Huge!!!,"I haven't tried this clock radio alarm, but it's gettin a one star rating for size. This thing is absolutely enormous...If you have difficulty seeing and need a super big display, then you may appretiate this clock. It's unfortunate that more pictures aren't available of the actual product, because I bought this thinking it may be somewhat compact. I was wrong. The picture here on amazon is misleading, but this is the only picture on the box as well. It has a huge back part that is too big for a small nightstand and will take up about a quarter of a pretty big one. If you don't care about size or need a giagantic clock this may be pretty good, but if you're looking for nice looking medium sized clock like I was, know that this is not it."
4,Clock radio,This is a very good clock radio. My only disappointment with it is that it is not an atomic clock.
4,Great features,"Pros:Very easy to read the time!Don't need to get out of bed to ""hit"" snooze. Although our is on a dresser a few steps from bed, and you do need to practice waving your arm just right.Dual alarm with weekday/weekend settings is a feature we use a lot.Neutral:Because of the added features, it takes a bit to learn how to work it.Cons:It's a little too smart. I've changed the time for daylight savings (once even after the official 2 a.m.) and keep forgetting that this is the one clock in the house not to change. A thought: if Congress changes the dates of DST again, this clock won't know it.Overall, we really like this clock."
3,great alarm terrible tining,I would love this radio if I could get it to tune a station. If you are looking for a great alarm and a good looking product this is it. Particularly appreciate the wave your hand to light the dial in the middle of the night and the sound isn't bad but the tuning forget about it.
3,Does not keep good time.,"We have had this clock for a year or so. It does not keep good time. I like the display and how it shows the alarms, but when the power goes out, the time gets off like any other clock. I am moving to an atomic clock that will be correct all the time."
2,May be obsolete again,"I bought this because I had the previous model with the pre-2007 daylight saving time settings. I had read on the net that the new Emerson clocks allowed you to change the DST week, but I bought this one and realized it cannot be changed. The energy act of 2005 that changed the DST for 2007 is going to be re-evaluated sometime, and congress reserved the right to revert to pre-2007 DST. If they do, then this clock is worthless and I'll have to go back to my old one."
2,Disappointed,"This radio was shipped in a timely manner and I was very pleased with it when it arrived. After about a month and a half some of the idicator lights started to blink for no reason. Shortly thereafter, all the indicator lights went on and I cannot shut them off. I cannot turn the radio on without constantly pressing all the buttons and then, when I succeed in turning the radio on, I cannot shut it off without pulling the plug, and sometimes it still plays when reconnected. I understand that the return period has expired but it is not worthwile to pay for returning the item for a partial refund at this stage. It is a shame that Emerson could not produce a radio that works for more than two months. In my youth they produced the most reliable products. I will continue to shop at Amazon and would even purchase another Emerson product, but this particular radio is a dud. P.S. It does keep excellent time!"
2,Not That Great,"Pros:- The clock has two alarms, and you can have them set up so that 1 is for weekdays and the other for weekends. I don't use that feature, but it's nice.- The clock is large, and even has the time of the alarms shown at the bottom for ease.- Intuitive buttons for changing time.Cons:- The motion-sensor is extremely buggy. I had to eventually put sticky-notes over it so that it would stop going into ""Snooze"" mode and activating the alarm all day. Kind of an eye-sore now.- Even though I purchased a NEW clock from Amazon, the Daylight Savings Time was wrong (AGAIN), so now I have to change the time 4 times per year, instead of the normal 2 times for a normal clock. (""Smart"" Clock indeed.)Conclusion: Only purchase a ""Smart"" Clock if it has been developed within the past year or so."
2,"One Good, One Bad","We bought two of these about 8 months ago. One is still working well, the other is kaput. Just stopped working. Got a nice email from the company saying that it was covered only by a 90 day warranty. So, we won't be buying our replacement from Emerson again since they don't stand behind their product. Too bad, because there is a lot to like about this clock radio."
1,broken,"After setting up, I noticed the whole lcd display turned off and on at random even without touching itor waving my hand. I returned it immediately and asked for refund."
3,It's Okay,"I purchased this clock to replace my last Emerson alarm clock (6 years old) when the volume control broke. When I bought this I didn't notice the wave sensor feature. I'd prefer not to have the wave sensor, and it is super-sensitive to any sort of motion. But I really like the two alarm features and the auto set feature, which is very useful to have after a power outage. The volume is plenty loud for being in the same room, but I wish it went as loud as the old alarm clock so I could listen to the radio from the bathroom. The picture is true to how the clock looks: it's not the best-looking clock, but it has a large display and gets the job done. Overall I'm moderately satisfied, and it's probably one of the better alarm clocks for under $30."
2,Doesn't last,"We had owned another Emerson autoset dual alarm clock and after a few years had to replace it when a button broke. Since that worked well, we wanted another Emerson. Well, after having used it for only 3 days, one of the alarms (my husband's) didn't go off. Luckily he got up anyhow, but while he was at work, I tried to see if perhaps the volume on the radio had somehow been turned down. Nope - radio didn't work at all. Then I discovered that neither did my alarm. Couldn't set it anymore. Several other ""features"" were non-operational as well. On the plus side, it has a great display, bright (but can be dimmed), good price. But if it doesn't work - none of that matters. Just printed the return label out and am not replacing it with the same manufacturers brand."
3,Emerson Jumbo alarm clock,"The clock and alarm function work fine, and relatively easy to do. I like the alarm function as it gets slightly louder the longer it rings until paused or shut off. The size really is Jumbo. My last Emerson was half the size and I think slightly too big. I read the dimensions before hand but just didn't think it would be that much bigger. My mistake. Otherwise it does it's job."
2,Too Easy,This game is way to easy. I beat Duke with Boston College 158 to 50. The graphics are bad and it is to easy to steel. Also most of the time when you do a alee-opp it misses. The commontaters are very bad to. Try NCAA Final Four 2002 its way better.
1,AWFUL GAME... WORST EVER!!!!!!!,IM WARNING ALL EA FANS (LIKE I AM) this game is AWFUL. Do Not buy it. It does not even have a season mode.. You can either play a tournament (which you cant even pick the teams for) or you can play a quick game... My ony question... WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO GET OUT FOR SUCH A ...GAME!!!!!!
1,WARNING: I heard this game has no season or dynasty mode,"I haven't played this game and probably never will because...WARNING: I read this game has no season or dynasty mode. I read this on a game related website. I'm not 100% sure, but if this game truly doesn't have a season or dynasty mode (only tourney or exhibition) then I'm not buying it. What is the point in this game without a season mode or recruiting and all that stuff? EASports has really let me down.Their NCAA Football has a great recruiting system. NBA Live has all kinds of season and career options. Now EA sports bball on the PS2 (supposed to be a great system) doesn't even have a season. I was going to get this game for by birthday, but now I'm definitely not. What a joke and an insult. I'll now look into NBA 2k2 or just wait until baseball season to buy a sports game. Heck, I might even try hockey."
4,copy of nba live,"this game is very under rated,even if there are no names just numbers it is still fun.i think if more people buy there would alot more people who would like it."
3,why it does not have a dynasty mode,why does this game not have a dynasty mode. Dynasty mode would have made the game more fun.so next time yall make a march madness please put in a Dynasty mode.Thank you Antonio Douglas.
4,March Dumbness 2002,"This game .... I should have rented it first. PLease don't buy it. If you are a person who likes graphics and no content whatsoever, this game is all yours. Whatever happened to the dynasty mode that MM2001 had? When you create a school you can't really enter it into the tournament. Another thing: it's really cool to see your guy dunk and break the glass on the backboard, but it is really annoying when you see it 5-6 times a game. THe dunks are great; there are so many of them. Another annoying thing is when you up-fake you usually make your shot. Like I already said the graphics are great. The courts, jerseys, player faces,and their bodies are pretty accurate. Frankly, this game should never have been on the market. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!"
1,NCAA March Madness 2002,"I thought it was a big disappointment to me. It was just not deep enough. You know you are in trouble when you just have tournement mode. The graphics were ok and I liked create a team,but that was all I liked during the game. Both NCAA March Madness 2002, and NCAA Final Four 2002 were flukes they suked!"
1,Now I can see why they picked this title.,"First off, let me describe this game in 3 statements....Not only is this the worst college basketball game EA Sports ever made, they make it worse by putting Shane Battier on the cover. Oh, and for all you Duke Blue Devil fans, read and weep. ... UNC #1!!!! This gameplay is so horrible, it makes you want to run this game over w/ an 18-wheeler. The graphics are also horrible. They are the same as the ...year before. If there was a 0 stars rating, that's what I would give this piece of ..."
2,NO WOMEN'S TEAMS OPTIONS????,"The main reason I purchased the March Madness line for PS1 was the women's team option.Now,it's gone.And for crying out loud,if EA can accurately depict NASCAR tracks,why can't they do the same with NCAA basketball arenas?? I rented a copy and was disapppointed.No more purchases until the women's mode comes back."
2,Great disappointment,"March Maddness 2002 is probably the worst EA Sports game to come out on the PS2. The lack features such as a season mode, real announcers, or the women's teams from the PS1 editions all make this game not worth the purchase prise it. If you are dying to play college ball, rent it. Otherwise, put your money elsewhere."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Grahphics, gameplay, sound, control......all top notch. You would think that would make for an awesome game right? Wrong. Unlike all the other EA sports games, this game has no season, franchise or dynasty modes. No create-a-player feature. The only thing you get is an average create-a-school feature (what good is that without a dyansty mode) and a lousy tournament mode. That is it. What fun is a tournament without taking your team through the season. That's like playing Madden and only getting to use a team in the playoffs. What a bunch of garbage this games turned out to be. It would have instantly been my favorite game if it only had the features of all the other EA sports games. I would not recommend this game to anyone."
1,NCAA MM 2002: You can buy my copy!,"I brought MM 2002 thinking this will better than the 2001 ps1 version, but I was betrayed by EA Sports! I was looking for an improvement of the scouting to find there's no scouting!! No franchise mode! You can not call any set plays, so you are basicly guessing where the open man will be (I like shooting treys off a screen!) Commentary is bad and boring. I think the gameplay would have been good if I was so annoyed with the missing features!RATING: 0 stars"
1,I hate this game,EA Sports should be ashamed. Only 130 teams and no season or dynasty mode. This game is like one from 10 years ago with no features and no long-term playability. I don't know if EA Sports will ever recover from this one.
2,Wait till next year,"The lack of season mode makes this game very old very quick. You can only play so many tournaments and exhibition games beore you just get bored with it. The only good thing about this game is the graphics. But they left out some features that made this game great on the PSOne, like a momentum meter that meant something.I can't believe that EA would release a game without a season or dynasty mode, especially after how great it made NCAA Football. Hopefully they'll get it right next year."
1,DO NOT BUY,I bought the game because of the dynasty mode in 2001 for the playstation. I expected this one to have it and got screwed. This does not live up to past games. I've played this game once and will never play it again.
2,Too Easy,"I am an 13-year-old kid who started playing PS2 when I got it for Christmas, 2001. This game is way to easy. I beat Duke with Boston College 158 to 50, even though I had Duke on SENIOR. The graphics are bad and don't even look one bit like the real players. They all look the same, basically. It's also too easy to steal. Most of the time when you do a alley-oop it misses. The commentators are very bad, too. The only good thing is the crowd, and the glass-shattering dunks. Try NCAA Final Four 2002---it's way better."
3,SHAME ON EA SPORTS!,"Shame on EA Sports! How dare they put out a sports game, a college basketball game no less, without a season plaaying feature or dynasty building mode...EA you do this in Madden and in Colleg Football..what gives? What could be a great game now is just average!"
1,"DON""T WASTE TIME OR MONEY","I should have waited. I pre-ordered this garbage, and was psyched when it came today. Everything you have heard is true: gameplay is good, and graphics are unreal, but (and this is a HUGE but) NO season no dynasty, no nothing. Additionally, the players on the teams do not correlate to anyone on any college team, i.e. the numbers, skin color, and years don't match reality. I know they are college players so EA Sports can't exactly imitate them -- but they do in NCAA Football. Even the coaches are WAY off. Don't waste your time on this one. I can't believe noone makes a good college basketball game. If you took parts from this one and Final Four you would be on your way."
1,bad game,this game is going to be really sorry only 2 modes of play not even a season i might just have to get final four
2,Disappointed,"This game isn't near what I expected from EA Sports. I'll give credit for the sharp graphics, but there are only two modes of play: exhibition and tournament. There is NO SEASON or DYNASY mode!!! Unbelievable!!! EA, you've again failed to make a solid college basketball product. I'll be returning my copy tomorrow. Potential buyers beware."
1,Multiple game modes...and no season or dynasty!!!!,"This might just be the biggest waste of money I've spent on a game. EVERY sports game I've ever owned has had some sort of season mode...how hard is it to have a season mode! I'm sure glad they put the ""all important"" create a team feature. What a waste of time. This could tarnish the March Madness name for years to come!"
1,What a waste of money,This game (was bad). I waited 3 months to get this stupid game and it just blows. There is no way a game of college should not have a dynasty mode to draft out of. College games of 3 years ago had this feature. All you can do is tournament and single game mode. Then to make me madder I bought it and could not get my money back from the store so I was stuck with it. I wouldn't buy this game to save my life. It just (was bad) big time.
3,Mixed emotions,"Sure, I knew the game would not offer a season or a dynasty mode, but I bought it anyway. The gameplay is actually pretty good. Unlike the Live series, if you make a bad pass it will get deflected and stolen. The graphics and AI are also improved upon from the Live Series. You won't find open point guards dribbling around the top of the key until the shot clock runs down. No, they drive to the basket and shoot in MM. The lack of a season mode(for crying out loud!) is by far the biggest detraction from the overall quaility of the game. If you plan on playing this game mostly in Single-player mode, forget it. Wait until the next installment is released. You're getting closer, EA. Next time include the missing game modes and INCLUDE MID-MAJOR Div. 1 teams! Where are my Ball State Cardinals?!?!?"
4,A Missing Link,"The game was not all that bad. I give it four stars because of the gameplay and the graphics. The bad part is the no season or dynasty mode. If season or dynasty, this would probably be the best college basketball game ever. You almost did it EA Sports, but you just fell short!"
1,boring,"I cannot believe that EA sports made this piece of junk as part of its otherwise superior sports series. No season mode, no historical teams, and limited replayability.. Buy a previous years' edition instead."
3,A Total Letdown!,"This was the first book I have read by Maryann Reid. I enjoyed reading it but the ending was awful.Since many reviewers have given great synopsis of the book, I will spare you the details. I just want to add that the transformation of the main character, Farah, was totally disheartening. She goes from an independent, career-minded woman to accepting being 2nd or 3rd fiddle to her boyfriend, Lenox. He is very manipulative and is willing to shower gifts as long as Farah stays in her place.As soon as it seems Farah has had enough and seems to find her inner strength again, Lenox shows up with a ring. The author never states whether or not Farah accepts the ring but it would been great to see Farah kick Lenox to the curb.I cannot recommend this book and I am not sure if I will try any other books by Reid."
3,Do we really want to send this message?,"This book is definitely a page turner although I am not sure I am comfortable with the messages it sends. Farah endures infidelity, physical and drug abuse by a mate - not to mention career sabotage - only to take Lenox back on a whim. I was waiting for her to get him back and do it well. I didn't expect that she would duck and run."
1,So Hard,"I started reading and found this to be so boring. I finally pushed myself through a couple more pages, still nothing. I came to Amazon to check reviews and seems everyone says it's slow until it gets to the middle. Well I can't wait that long and if Farah is going to hang around a louzy no count man for gifts..she can do that by herself lol. I'm closing this book for good!"
3,Used,"The story line was boring until half way through. Farah and Lenox both used each other to get what they needed. Farah needed a better career and Lenox needed a female that he could show off to mama because he sure couldn't take his French play toy home to his mother,(Maritza). In the end, Lenox and Farah ended up falling in love with each other but it was a year to late to put things back together. Truth be told, I think they do good by themselves."
3,"..Sisters, please don't try this at home!""","If the average, everyday woman tried some of the mess Ms. Reid's main character dished out -- well, let's just say you might be watching her on the late night news!Ms. Girl should have worn a blinking neon sign that said...""Ball-breaker On Board!"" -- Talk about having no respect for the male population, she used them only for what was in their pants or their pockets.Albeit, the novel was a little over the top, it was still a good read, and for ONCE I'm sure we women were hoping the guy came out on top!"
4,Good Read,"I really enjoyed reading this book. Farah and Lenox were quite intriging. The way they used each other for their own gain. The end left me wondering was there more to be told for the two of them. Also, does Farah's best friend, Lola, have a story to tell? I can't wait for Ms. Reid's next novel. I truly enjoyed this one."
3,What Is Her Problem?,"Being that I've read the other book ""Sex And The Single Sister"" I understood how the build of the main character ""Farah"" was brought to life in Use Me Or Lose ME. I like the book but then again I didn't because after getting with Mr. Lenox she seem to get real soft and vey insecure towards any and everything it drove me crazy. But I love the whole plot of the book I enjoyed every part especially how she met Lenox. REad to your desire all I know is that I enjoyed it."
4,Very Interesting,"This was a very interesting love story. Farah Washington and Lenox Whitworth are both using each other--Farah climbing the ladder to success on her job and Lenox using her to compliment him. While playing this game they both fall in love, but failed to admit that each other.My favorite character was Farah Washington--news anchor---wanting to be the star of a very popular news show. She was very strong and independent, but had problems with keeping a man.Every woman would love Lenox--he is tall, dark and handsome and very rich--a charmer and smooth operator with the women.I like the book and out 1 to 5--rate it 3.5 . The only thing I would change is Farah getting revenge on Ms. Myers--Lenox's aunt.Review given by Vanessa Cofield of The Sophisticated Souls of Learning Book Club"
5,Scandolous,"Ried's book is hot! The sex scenes are steamy and I even used one with my lover. I just keep this away from the kids. Besides that, I couldnt put the book down. And when I did, I couldnt stop thinking about!"
1,Failed repeatedly and slow write times,"This drive has already failed twice during the first few months I have owned it (unreadable). I had to reformat it, losing all data on the drive. Coupling this with the extremely slow write times, even on small files, makes this a drive to avoid."
1,Sloooowwww!,"This drive was purchased at what I thought was a bargain price, but it is so slow, FREE would be overpriced. It is so slow it's almost useless on large files. It takes much longer than any of my flash cards or pen drives. Don't waste your money."
3,A Little Too Mellow,"This is my least favorite, BUT, ""Somehow Our Love Survives"" is so superb, it remains an all-time favorite. Maybe I didn't give this album a fair shot as I prefer more uptempo music."
2,Smooth ooze,"2 1/2This drafty-not-breezy adult contemporary does retain a slight credibility mainly because of its bossa nova borrowings, but plays out as Brazilian jazz for the Borders set, with a pretentiously breathy approach."
2,I Abandoned This One!!!,I bought this CD not long after it came out. It didn't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it!!! I like Somehow Our Love Survives and Abandoned Garden. Other than that this is a mediocre effort for Michael. He has used this kind of Brazilian theme on Sleeping Gypsy already. Stick with your roots Michael...you are from California...not South America. Try buying Blue Pacific instead!!! I abandoned this one a long time ago.
1,not worth the money,I had to return the converter as the image quality suffers significantly. I used a tripod and used it handheld with the G series 70-200mm lens. The images were significantly reduced in their quality. I had to return the unit as it was unacceptable or me.
2,"Excellent in 1996, now out-of-date, pessimistic, and narrow.","When I read The World of the Autistic Child two years ago, I found myself discouraged and depressed. I did learn the value of early intervention, but nothing about the enormous amount of biochemical research being done to discover the cause and find the means to cure this disorder. This book is hopelessly out-of-date now with its exclusive focus on the behavioral approach. It needs to be revised and expanded with the assistance of knowledgeable bio-scientists currently researching the field, hopefully before many more newly diagnosed families get the inappropriate pessimism this book presents about autism spectrum disorder."
3,The World of the Autistic Child : Understanding and Treating,"Wow. The most depressing book on autism one can imagine. Every accomplishment of the autistic person, from a child learning to read to Temple Grandin's autobiography, is couched as either a bizarre manifestation of the disorder or a hoax instead of a real acheivement. The autistic child's potiential is painted in broad strokes. She states that having autism effectively adds one degree of mental retardation to the prospects of those with the disorder. (Is there really even a universal future for those with mental retardation?) Much faith is placed on meticulously refining, defining, and labeling various locations on the autistic spectrum. The book isn't a total loss. There are suggestions for dealing with real problems that are worthwhile."
1,Horrible book written by a condescending hater,"We went to an idiot psychologist who gave us the diagnosis of Autism on a Friday evening in a real insensitive fashion and told us to spend the weekend reading this bookOMG this is a miserable outdated book ( outdated stats like 70% of people with autism have MR )She is such a downerShe quotes beautiful but depressing poetry.If you are just finding about your chid's autism read something written by a real authority like Dr greenspan such as Engaging Autism or ""The child with special needs"" or ""Sonrise"" or ""Let me hear your voice""run away from this awful book"
3,Good Shooting Action,"This game is a good side scrolling shoot'em up, difficulty is good calibrated, and you'll make progress at each game. Graphics is good but nothing very amazing, the color palette is quide dark, and sometimes enemies blend a bit too much with the background (this is a problem that GBA SP owners will not encounter).Anyway if you like sidescrolling shooters, and if you already own Gradius for GBA, this game could be a worthy purcase."
2,"Been there, done that.","This game is your typical average 2-D side scrolling shooter. Nothing new to this one. The graphics are good and the music is OK, in my opinion. The ship has 3 different speeds (slow, mid, fast), but the fastest speed is nothing you couldn't handle, so you'll always want your ship on fast, making the other 2 settings pretty much useless. Game control is really good, no complaints there. One of the most dissapointing features is that the game only has 4 different weapons, and you can easily get all of them by the second stage. This makes playing the later stages of the game rather monotonous. In general, this is a really difficult game to beat, but then again that's not a new feature either. If you are a fan of shooters, I'd recommend you to borrow it from a friend, or maybe rent it without expecting much."
5,We LOVE This Game,"My husband, the 3 year old, and I love playing this game for family game time. It allows the kiddo to practice counting; it allows for good old-fashioned, friendly competition; and it's easy to play and clean up.Win! Win! Win!Overall: Highly recommend."
1,Not a genujine Mantovani recording,"Since Mantovani never recorded anything by Andrew Lloyd Webber, this is obvoiusly not a genuine recording by Mantovani. It is merely another example of deceiptful use of the Mantovani name for the purpose of ripping off customers. This is no less serious than the sale of knock-off Rolex watches and Amazon seems to be willing to do this over and over again."
4,possible causes of decline,"The title is a conscious echo of Gibbons' famous work. No surprise then to see a chapter excerpted from Gibbons. Who is surely the best known of the contributors. The other historians are of more recent vintage. Offering different speculations as to why Roman fell. Typically, none of these claim to be the only reason, or even necessarily the main cause of decline.But to a reader interested in classical history, the book's ideas can be provoking. For example, Boak suggested that manpower shortages were a factor in the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. That this led to the necessary importing of foreign mercenaries (""barbarians""), especially in central Europe. A trend that would have deleterious consequences by the late 4th century."
2,"should be titled ""single and not too happy about it""","I was deeply disappointed in this book. The title of the book lead me to believe that it would give me encouragement in being single. It focused way too much on finding a mate. I agree with the focus on making yourself better..spiritually, physically etc... The book however kept coming back to holding your head high and the right person would come along. I guess being single isn't so great and anyone who is single should continue to focus on finding someone. Big let down!!"
1,God & The Single Girl,"When I picked up a copy of this book at the library I figured that it would be a book singing the praises of a carefree, single life. Instead, I got a book about being single and how you can and should try to fit God into your life. If I wanted a sermon, I'd go to church. I was so disappointed when I read this book but I am happy that I didn't spend my own money to buy it."
4,Not pretty to wear but great protection,I bought this hearing protection because I am a senior citizen who has become protective of her hearing. I vacuum regularly and in the summer use a power mower. I had the little foam inserts that were not effective. The first time I used the Peltor hearing protectors I was amazed at how quiet the vacuum motor became. For the lawn mower sound I will have to wait until spring. I saw myself in a mirror and they aren't pretty but they sure muffle the sound and are reasonably comfortable.
3,Cushion parts fell off,"My workplace is noisy, so I bought these. The price is right. Theymuffle all of the harsh sounds. After a while, if you wear them longenough, though, your ears get sore. You have to take them off every so often.Another problem. I left them in my hot car and ever since then, bothcushions fall out. They don't fit into the canister tight enough. Bothof them fell out one day when I was walking with them in my hand. Ifsomeone hadn't pointed it out, they would have been lost. I'm going tohave to get some Atomic Glue and glue them in. I also use them ascheap headphones. I use ear buds and place these over them. It worksgreat, especially for audio books. It's hard to understand audiobooks in my work environment. After I glue them, they should be fine.I'd give them a 4 or 5 if they didn't make my ears sore, or fall apart.Recommended. Just make sure the cushions fit tight."
4,Does a decent job,"The hearing protection does a good job blocking out outside noise, especially peoples voices when im trying to read. The only thing that I don't like about the 3m peltor's are they can become a bit painful on the ears after a while. Its to be expected I suppose with any form of hearing protection but I would really love it if some company would come out with a comfortable pair of hearing protection."
3,Does the job but its too tight,it fits very well around my ears but after a minute or 2 it hurts my blood circulation around the outer ears.If i could finda headset with the same noise cancelling effect but less pressure and more comfort.
5,"""Typical life for foam cushions is 6 months""!","This blows my old hearing protectors away, and I wish I had them years ago. My air conditioner is so loud I have to wear earplugs or a headset protector like this. When I put these on, I couldn't believe how the noise disappeared. The only thing I found disturbing was the statement that ""typical life for foam cushions is 6 months"". Now, I don't mind paying 20 dollars for these great hearing protectors, but wouldn't want to pay that every 6 months. Does anyone have any long term experience that reflects on that statement?"
5,Best yet. And cheap,I Bought them for myself and the kids. No complaints. Comfy enough and very effective. I would recommend them again.
5,Fantastic pair -- perfect 10,"These are by far my favorite hearing protectors.1. Very quiet.2. Durable3. Good value4. Comfortable.I use them when using power tools and also in the airplane. These units have the best trade-offs: you can still hear people talk (very softly to you) and have fantastic noise reduction. These units are also very very comfortable -- my best pair.Other units I've owned include the folding Peltor and an Howard Leight (super-high NRR). The blue Peltor is my favorite.BTW, the person who gave this hearing protection a 1 star is just plain _stupid_. This product is meant to filter out NOISE, NOT INCLUDING SPEECH. This is a .. duh .. safety product."
3,not that great,"I use them when I study because it's really noisy where I live. They do work at making small sounds still go away, but you definitely still hear people talking clearly and music (or maybe I just live with really loud people). I wouldn't recommend using them for a long period of time because they create a lot of inner-ear pressure and I get really bad headaches after wearing them. But when I'm desperate and can't get away to a quite place, they definitely work better than regular earplugs."
5,USE THIS,"This is the best of the sound deadeners I have tried. But I write this review not so much to tout the product as to encourage the reader to USE HEARING PROTECTION. As someone who did not use hearing protection for years, and now suffers from tinnitus, I urge you to save your hearing. There is no way to get it back once it goes."
5,"Very comfortable, good protection",I use this one at the range most often because of its high NRR rating and it sits comfortably on my ears. It's well padded and rarely leaks sound in like others. The only con is that its a bit large and sometimes interferes with a close stock weld.
4,No big problems with them.,"They work well and muffle the sound of my riding mower while I do the weekly mowing. I have some small ear bud headphones that I wear under them so I can listen to the music I have on my phone. They are a bit tight for my fat head, but I think they are stretching. (Or maybe my head is getting skinnier, who knows)."
4,Works well at a great price,"First off, these aren't built for looks. They look a bit funny when you wear them. But then again they're not built for style; they're built to protect your hearing. These are very well constructed. I'm actually wearing them as I type and they are very comfortable. I plan on using these at the range and have fired in confined spaces already and just barely heard a ""pop"". I've got a few other house hold projects that will require the use of loud equipment so these will come in handy."
4,Pleasantly surprised,Pleasantly surprised with this product muffles out a lot of the noise. Worked really well for what I need it for. Would purchase again with out a doubt.
5,Very effective,These work great. I have been wearing them over ear plugs as I'm concerned with hearing loss and want the belt and suspenders approach but even without the plugs the ear protection is very effective. They are comfortable and after a few hours at the range I find that my ears surprisingly feel as good as they did when I arrived. I recommend these without reservation.
5,Great protection!,"I wear these with plugs. The combination works great. I shoot a hundred rounds a week indoors. These deaden even the magnums in the stalls next to me. Better price on [...]though, where I bought my second pair."
1,Save your money,Mine fell apart after the second use. The blue plastic outer cover that houses the insulation fell off in my shooting bag after the second use. I tried to glue it back on and also tried to use duct tape. I ended up throwing it away.
4,Great Protection at bargin price,These fit really well and were at the right price for me. Easy to adjust and compact to fit in your range bag easily.
3,"Not bad, not great","I was looking for a headset that would block out noise without being an expensive music-providing item like the Bose headphones. For the price, you can't go wrong; it blocks out most of the noise but not as much as I expected. My daughter has a soft voice and when she talks I can hear everything she says."
5,For homework,My girlfriend wears these while doing homework. They block out ambient sound pretty well. When combined with earplugs they work extremely well!
5,fantastic for mowers,"If you do a great deal of field mowing as I do, you'll find that this protector is just the perfect device for saving your hearing! It's low in price, comfortable, and not completely unattractive for those concerned about their appearance even while mowing. ""Veni, Vidi, Demessi!"""
4,3M Peltor Hearing Protector,I have had hearing loss and am careful with loud noise which I experience with my mower and power tools. This brand of hearing protector does a good job of reducing noise for me.
5,Motorola RAZR V3 V3c PEBL U6 SLVR S7 V360 ~ Auto Car Charger w/ IC Chip,Product as expected. Received quickly. Great communication with the order.
1,Not a good book!,"Kitty in the City was incredibly disappointing to me. Thestory was bland and unoriginal, the main character seemed like she wassupposed to be Eloise-like but without Eloise's spunk and humor, the colored-pencil drawings were adequate at best and bland at worst, the production values were shoddy (the tile wasn't even printed on the spine? Hello?), and more from there.Do not buy this book!"
4,ALASKA'S THREE BEARS,I saw this book in the shops in Alaska and wanted to purchase them so I could share our trip to Alaska with our Grandchildren. But the books were pricey and I had to consider weight and space in our luggage returning home. I was glad to find this book on Amazon used and reasonably priced.
4,Jillian at Ashley River Elm.,"The book, Alaska's Three Bears, is a very good book. The facts were EXCELLENT. The story was a little bit like Goldie Locks and the Three Bears. It was really cute,I loved it."
4,Get the classic version,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter enjoys this game, except that sometimes it can be too drawn out, depending how many ""chutes"" you get. We don't always play a whole game. The look of this version is so much nicer than the newer ones (I think), and the only skills needed are: be able to count up to 6, and move in the right direction. There are arrows at the end of each line to show which direction to go next, but it took a few games for her to understand where to go. The tin is much sturdier than a cardboard box, the board and spinner are of heavy construction, and the plastic pieces are durable. Overall, I definitely recommend this over other versions I have seen."
5,Thank you Amazon!,"Ray Conniff's ""We Wish You A Merry Christmas"" holds so many precious memories for my family and me. We first got the album Christmas of 1965. I had just turned 10. It was not until I heard this album did I fully appreciate Christmas Carols. Ray Conniff has a wonderful gift for touching the harts of both young and old, for my grandparents enjoyed Conniff's Christmas music as well. My father often said that that so much of Christmas is Conniff's Christmas music. In those days we had a ""mono"" phonograph"". By the time we got a stereo, the album was not available. For over 20 years I have been searching for this album. With the advent of CD's, I was hopeful that I would find it reproduced on CD. In Canada, this CD or any Christmas CD by Conniff is not available. So I checked Amazon.com. Lo and behol, there is was. The delivery was prompt, and I am listening to it as I write this. Again, a huge thank you, Amazon!! P.S. I ordered 2--one for Dad for Christmas and one for me!"
4,Ray Coniff - We Wish You a Merry Christmas,Another tape that brought back so many happy memories. Great melodies and a tape loaded with the classics. You won't be disappointed!
2,THIS IS A GREAT ALBUM BUT......,"Well, I also grew up listening to this record and I love it so much. You too would enjoy it a lot provided you get all the tracks listed on the cover disk (as with the original record). My CD arrived a few days ago and was very excited however, the disks itself contains only 6 tracks The distributor confirmed the number of tracks(6 only) as per Amazon customer service.If you get the CD with the complete tracks (14 songs), I envy you.....me.....well I had to return it. Otherwise. i would have rated it with 10 STARS!"
3,"I love Ray Conniff , just not this cd.",My problem with this item is that the Picture on Amazon and the Cover of the CD say that there is 12 songs. Amazon says there is 6 songs. When I got the item it only had 6 and the CD cover says there is 12. A little upsetting. I would buy another of the cd's with more songs. It's not Christmas until you hear Ray Conniff and his singers.
5,GREAAAAAAAAAAAAT!,"BACK IN THE 60'S I GREW UP LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM. WE PLAYED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. YEARS LATER, MY MOM MOVED US TO AUGUSTA, GA. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS ALBUM FOR THE PAST 15 YEARS. EVERY CHRISTMAS I ALWAYS RAN INTO A BLANK WALL. CHRISTMAS IS NOT THE SAME WITHOUT THE WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS ALBUM. EVERY NOW AND THEN I MAY HEAR A SONG FROM THAT ALBUM IN A MALL OR STORE AND IT GIVES ME A WARM FEELING INSIDE. IT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. CHRISTMAS IS NOT LIKE IT USE TO BE. EVERYTHING IS RUSH, RUSH, RUSH. BUT WITH THE RAY CONIFF CHRISTMAS ALBUM, WE WISH YOU A MERRY CHRISTMAS IT MAKES IT LAST LONGER AND GIVES THE REAL MEANING OF CHRISTMAS. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME FIND THIS ALBUM? PRETTY PLEASE.THANK YOU, DEB"
5,Xmas CD,"Ray Conniff's Christmas CD, We Wish You a Merry Christmas, is the best Christmas CD I've ever heard. The medley songs are unique and the choice of songs are A plus. I heard one of the medley songs on the radio and went through a lot of trouble to find this CD. The stores do not seem to carry it so I bought it from Amazon, listened to it this past Christmas and then ordered more to give as Christmas presents in 2011. If you hear this CD you will love it as much as I do. The order is easy through Amazon and delivery went well also."
5,nostalgia,My parents first introduced me to this album back when I was fairly young. It's been a while so when I found a CD release of this I just had to get it. The sounds and vocals from this album will fill your home with warmth and will put you into the Christmas spirit mood.It's perfect for the holidays when having your family over for that beautiful Christmas dinner and even when it isn't around that time of year it's a good listen even in the summer. Definitely worth it in my opinion and at the very least deserves a few moments of your time to listen to a few clips of the songs if you were still thinking about it.
5,great Christmas album,"This is one of those CDs that truly captures the Christmas magic. Most people don't know who Ray Conniff is but have probably heard much of the material on this album growing up, especially Ring Christmas Bells and The Little Drummer Boy. This CD and Ray Conniff's ""Here We Come A-Caroling"" are must-haves for any Christmas music collection. The vocals by the Ray Conniff Singers are superb."
5,a MUST have,"Just like ""Christmas with Coniff"", This is also a delightful holiday CD. In my home, it is not Christmas without Ray Conniff's holiday albums. I recommend it."
1,Button Didn't Work,"I bought this for my family, we were excited about it only to receive it and one of the buttons did not work so we could not set the scale. I returned it only to have the replacement have the exact same problem. I returned that one also. The scale was very accurate however you could not set your data to track your progress, which is why I bought it. I went to Kohl's and bought this brand but a more expensive model and it works great."
2,Snatch it up!,"With just having heard the new material from Mari Wilson, I am convinced you better snatch this cd up! ""Cause when people hear the new stuff, they are going to want the past releases!Get it before the prices go up!Man, the new stuff is, well....It's all about Mari!"
4,Gingerbread Surprises!,"An endearing children's story, ""The Gingerbread Rabbit"" by Randall Jarrell, with delightful black-and-white illustrations by Garth Williams, is a perfect bedtime story. Little Mary's mother loves her very much, and one day, while Mary is at school, her mother decides to fix her a surprise. She makes a gingerbread rabbit, but it is afraid of being eaten, so it runs away. In so doing, it encounters various woodland animals, some innocent and some dangerous. Meanwhile, the mother pursues him in desperation. It seems that no solution can be found, but as with many fairy-tale-like stories, both the rabbit and the mother enjoy a happy ending."
4,"Fun, unexpected story","My daughter and I enjoyed reading this story. She is very interested in rabbits, and the gingerbread rabbit's canny attitude one moment and naivete the next made for amusement on our parts. The fox's section was definitely the highlight of the story. As a mom, I appreciated that the story brought a resolution for the mom, although of COURSE she would not be able to catch the gingerbread rabbit!"
2,Not for small kids!,I cannot believe that this book is listed for baby-preschool. It is a VERY long and wordy book. There is NO WAY that my three kids could sit and follow this book in one sitting! I would rate this for elementary age not preschool! I only bought it to read to my kids this Easter- but it will be put a way for at least a couple of years. I am bummed!
3,Really cool & fun... but not for long!,"I guess it was late 2000 when I saw this toy on the Rosie O'Donnell Show. I had to have it! I looked everywhere for it, and was unable to find it. I asked ""Santa"" for it, and after he hunted it down, I got it for Christmas. I played with it, got the hang of it, and had my brothers, parents, and neighbors all try it. We all loved it! But all of a sudden it died. I thought ""OK here is another battery eater, but I don't care, I love it."" I changed the batteries, played with it until it died again- didn't last as long this time. Changed the batteries AGAIN and this time it barely lasted 2 minutes before it died. It ended up being the toy the 2nd and 3rd time, not the batteries. This thing didn't even last a day. I returned it the next day- standing in a line for a greater period of time than I had even played with the toy! The lady at the store said a lot of these toys had been returned. :( I was sad to see such a cool toy be such a dud!! :("
1,Los Maestros Ascendidos no profetizan,"Todo estudiante sincero y diligente de la Luz sabe que, debido al LIBRE ALBEDRIO del ser humano, los Maestros Ascendidos no profetizan.Obviamente la autora de este libro utilizó el nombre del amado Saint Germain para propósitos evidentemente comerciales."
2,Good for a few chuckles.,"Literally, just a few. This movie, unfortunately, is otherwise pret-tee lame. No special Meatwad moments, no quotable Shake lines, no replay value. And Meatwad's voice seemed to be awfully low in the audio mix. Glad I rented instead of purchased. If you are just getting your feet wet with ATHF, rent, buy, or watch on TV the original episodes."
3,Non-essential,"Don't get me wrong, I love me some ATHF, but I didn't think there was anything better in the movie than you can't find in the episodes. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought with a bigger budget and a longer running time, they could push the series to new heights, but it just seems like an overlong episode with a bad ration of hit or miss jokes.I guess that's what I like about the tv show - it's hit or miss, but it's only 10 minutes long and then you're on to the next. The movie just kinda drags for me and I kept thinking that something huge and hilarious is about to happen, but it never really did.Worth watching, not really worth buying. If you're not a ""completest"" and just want to pick up some DVDs for casual (ie stoned) viewing, pick up the series first. I do like the DVD cover though..."
4,Pretty funny.,For fans only. I doubt people not familiar with the show would enjoy this much at all.
3,borderline funny,compared to the series.....just not all that funny......they were losing it before this movie was made.....
3,ATHF Colon Movie,"I like your booty, but im not gay. Great neil peart cameo. Funny, but not up to usual ATHF standards"
1,Why would anyone waste time and money on making something like this?,"There is currently a lot of controversy about Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters for DVD and I know that any review on the subject will almost certainly cause someone to distort the facts. Still, the film makes no sense at all.Anyone associated with the creation and production of this film must sense its own irremediable inferiority. That's why fans are so desperate to promote, foster, and institute it; it's the only way for the fans to distinguish themselves from the herd.Why do fans consistently refuse to acknowledge that Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters for DVD descends from a long line of jackbooted, reprehensible sociopaths who like to subvert time-tested societal norms?The creators of this film can't possibly believe that clever one-liners are a valid substitute for actual thinking. You really have to see it to believe how god-awful it is."
2,one of the dumbest movies i ever saw,I really like the tv show but this movie it was so dumb I cant even remember what it was about 10 minutes after watching it.
3,Only druggies and wannabes should give this 5 stars,"I'm a HUGE fan of this show. I watch it every night at about 4:00am before I go to bed. It's a grown up nighty-night cartoon to put me to sleep when my girlfriend won't put out. The first two seasons of this cartoon are masterpieces. All the new episodes (and the majority of this movie) lack the creativity and addictiveness of the latter and are replaced by unfunny gore and violence. The movie is a combination of the the good, the bad, and the ugly...it's just a shame that the bad and ugly outweigh the good."
3,Good ideas,"Unless you are building the plan, it is not a How-to Book. it is really only an idea book. I did enjoy it, but it is not a reference book"
2,I'm sorry I bought it.,"I think I may have reviewed this on the IMDB, but I really didn't care for this overly long psuedo continuation of my favorite set of characters, the 1970's Salkind musketeer films.It's overly long, weighted with psychological dilemmas, it's probably another mental health film helping a portion of girls deal with their tomboyness or something. Heck, I don't know, nor do I care. What I do know is that it's along, boring and just full of uninsipred and no fun material.York gets a paycheque for slapping his name on a musketeer film, Depardieu does the same, and what's her name struts her stuff as a machismo female in training.I guess the one advantage this thing has is that it was actually shot in France, unlike the previous films, which were shot in Spain. Cest la vie.Watch it if you must, but don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Terribly written with some ok examples,"I've been doing 3D programming for over 2 decades and just wanted to get a leg up on the new Java 3D stuff. I believe that had I not had extensive experience with 3D before, I would have found it impossible to follow the content of this book. I found myself constantly astounded that this book made it past the copy editors. Besides the scores of typos, it reads like it was translated from Russian to English by a newly arrived Chinese Math TA. There are some good examples although they don't demonstrate all of the features of Java3D. I learned more from the online javadoc pages and the online tutorial. There may be some useful snippets of code to use as inspiration for your own programs but there is nothing in here that couldn't be easily generated by yourself. Who's writing a good Java3D book? If noone volunteers, I'd be happy to write one that's better than this one."
3,"Those that can do, those that can't teach-These Guys Do!","After 4 yerars of programming, I have to say that this book is the strangest programming book I have ever come accross. It is a VERY difficult read for someone not familiar with the Java 3-D API (As I was), and if that person is not familiar with Java, Forget about it. This is definitely not the book to learn from. It often reads like a sales pitch/ego trip from someone who has been around the technology since the beginning, and as such offers very little educational benefit. I wish somebody (Sun Maybe? ) would get it together and come out with something useful on this subject. The bad stuff having now been said, I really have to say the Code Samples were great, demonstrating as I said above--Those that can do, Those that can't teach. These guys are great Java 3D Programmers, but horrible teachers!"
2,Not so good.,"This book is not so good. I've read plenty of good references in my day, and this isn't one. It reads at times like a sales pitch for the technology. Sometimes it's overly elementary and sometimes it's completely bewildering. Perhaps future versions of Java 3D will have the good fortune to be documented by better materials."
2,a hasty treatment,"The authors seemed like they knew what they were talking about, but rushed through the material. Whether it was their fault, or pressure from editors, I don't know. I do know that the subject needed a more thorough treatment. Excessive listings made me feel like they were trying to pad the length (try changing the margins- worked for me in college), and the writing style struggled to stay focused at times. I learned a lot from the book, but most of it was from dissecting the listings- something I could have done, and ended up doing, on my own with the java 3d demos. I think it would have been better if they had taken one concept at a time, discussed it in depth with examples, and used each of these sections as blocks to build on throughout the book."
2,Poorly Organized Book,"Im a bit confused by the good ratings for this book. Must be freinds of the authors. The overall feeling you get reading the book is ""rushed"". There is no nice progression of simple->complex examples to let you learn the basics. The logical progression of ideas inside the chapters seems akward. Also I think the pages and pages of listings are just an attempt at bulk up the book.The authors seem like they know the material, so I am confused why these book is so light wieght."
1,No technical book - only Plug and Play applets,"This book contains about 10 applets. The book explains the parameters for these applets. This book explains nothing about the code it just prints the sourcecode, but today nobody prints his complete sourcecode in his book when it is also on the CD-ROM. On the other side the book tells about programms on the CD-ROM, which are not part of the CD-ROM. Another bad point is that the text from page 11 ist copied and pasted to page 81, that's really bad style. If you want to use prepared 3D applets at your homepage, this book may help you, but this book is nothing for developers."
1,"Ready-to-Run, provided you don't want to know how","If all you want are some java applets that you can adapt to your own use without ever understanding the API, then this is the book for you. It glazes over huge issues, while spending page after page explaining how to adapt their own examples in vain hopes you might actually be able to use them. If you want to learn how to program Java3D - don't buy this book, you're better off with the docs. If you just want to swipe existing applets - still don't buy this book, you can probably find some online and save yourself $45."
2,No Help,As someone unfamiliar with the Java 3D API this book was no help. Its very focused on creating Java 3D applets and doesn't go a lot into helping me understand the concepts behind the 3D API. I returned it.
1,Awful,"The book is very easy reading and some of the basic information is fine (vitamins and how they help the body). There are no studies sited in the book that proves what he states about supplements though. They are his opinions. His advice about working out is terrible! I am an exercise physiologist and he gives down right terrible info about exercise. Matter of fact, with this info you can hurt yourself. Be ware readers."
3,Funny & Engaging,"Chamber's book on the life of a middle aged man trying to find his way and having the world fall apart on him in the form of back trouble is pretty predictable and doesn't have much in terms of storyline and content. It is however saved by her wonderful sense of humour which keeps you laughing from start to finish. When the protagonist ends up with the woman he loves and ends the novel feeling happy, we actually feel happy along with him and wanna clap him on his back. Entertaining stuff."
4,Fast Results!,"I used Royal Purple for my moped and it it went from 30mph tops to 33-35mph. I was pretty surprised about the results, especially since it was a notable difference on the first run.I rode my moped for about 20miles yesterday. I can't say if it prolongs my mopeds life but I'll update this if needed.I would give it a full 5 stars had they used the conventional bottles with a measuring compartment. It gets kind of messy trying to pour it into a cup or gas tank."
1,"""synthetic"" is an advertizing word with no legal connotation - horrible oil","so most people try this stuff and love it right away, and then go out to make a review before they see the problems. Much like a full tank of gas seems to make a car run better in ones mind (or a clean car) these don't have anything to do with a vehicle running. This oil is nothing more than refined and dyed vegetable oil. This oil will shorten the life of any motor and it burns off or creates leaks because of its structure.More than being a huge money maker for the team who markets it as a high performance product, this oil will soon find itself as part of a class action lawsuit. Read the forums online and you will see for yourself. Mechanics will tell you the same thing - stay away from this product and be careful when buying ""synthetic"" type 2 and 3 oils"
4,Finally a reasonably price synthetic.,"The local bike shops are trying to charge me $20+ for synthetic for my 2 stroke Kymco scooter. As far as I can tell, this works just as well as Forza and can be had for a fraction of the price and delivered to your door.I'll be ordering this again."
5,Truely the best in synthetic lubrication,A 1st time user on this particular Royal Purple product. Tried it on a John Deere branded (made by Echo) 38cc straight shaft brush cutter that I personally purchased new and have used for 20 years. This tool was switched to Amsoil (100:1) shortly after break in and was the only mix used up to this time. Huge improvement in starting n performance on the 1st tank full with RP (100:1 mix). Runs cooler and have noticed a major reduction in exhaust odors. Have used RP lubrication on all of my motorized vehicles for 2 years (93 Mazda/05 Dodge Hemi/99 John Deere 4100 diesel). The price is not a concern with me after I witness the great improvement in performance.
2,NOT!!,Hardly the quotes I thought they were...Just things people thought were smart. Many are just cliches and not too original
4,1001 smartest things ever said (1001),Great little book. Fun/interesting and informative!!! Buy it!!
2,"Great movie, the worst video quality!!!","Why oh why did these video manufacturers do such a lousy job of transferring hard to find movies. I bought this tape brand new. When i received it, it was recorded in the SP mode. When i started to watch it, the video quality was horrible!!!! Nice work MCM Entertainment! Why bother? If you don't mind watching this great movie with far less than good quality, by all means buy yourself a copy. For me, i will hope it comes on television again someday and set my TIVO to record it. I would have rather done a review concerning the movie itself and Susan Dey's great performance. Instead i felt you should be warned about the tape itself."
5,Remembering Susan Dey's Caged without a key,"I agree that this movie starring Susan Dey was one of her better movies which, I'm sorry that I can't find on dvd. I don't remember it being called Imprisoned women it was just ""Caged without a key""I just hope that it does go to dvd soon. Another movie starring Susan Dey that I can't find is when she played a unstable mother on the verge of killing her only child. During the movie she is seeing a theopist for being bipolar which back then they knew little on how to treat it but, towards the end she's losing it a trying to call for help but can't find it and ends up murdering her baby girl.I Don't remember the name of it. I think it was call Mary Jane doesn't live here any more.If anyone knows I'd like to find out. N.D"
4,Grows On You,Very cool album. Definitely on the mellow side. The two different vocals are nice and keep it interesting and the guitars are very spacey. I like that it grows on you the more you listen to it so not an album that you bored with. So very cool new band and reccomended.
1,I just paid for an ad!,This is nothing but a ad for a booth designer who will design your booth and send it to you for your auto cad program. I feel ripped off.
4,a mi suegra le encanta,a mi suegra le encanta su termo de hecho fue uno de los regalos que le dimos para navidad y le encanta dise que su te o cafe se mantiene caliente durante un buen periodo lo recomiendo para aquellas personas que les gusta el te.
3,Driver Support Lacking_But works fine with XP SP3,"I did not have any problem installing a hard drive, but the driver mini-cd supplied with the unit does not work for Windows 2000, and it is almost impossible to find the right one. If I ever find the driver, I might like the unit, but I would not advise buying one of these.3 1/2 years later I am editing my review. This unit works nicely with XP sP3. I have not tried it with Windows 7."
3,"Normally Functioning, but the design is too bad","I can't even put my hard disk inside, and thus I have to leave the case open"
4,Saving Grace,"I had a bad Hard disk crash. After installing a new disk I put the old disk into the Sabrent ECS-STU35K USB case, I was able to recover many of the files on the crashed disk.The Sabrent ECS-STU35K USB saved me.Just plugged it into the USB port and it worked strate off."
1,Poor quality & design,"I bought 2 of these - big mistake. Ended up having to return them both for refund. First unit was DOA dead power supply, the second unit suffered with with very slow transfer rates <6Mb/sec with USB2.0 Installing the HDD is relatively painless but getting the HDD centered so you fix the the HDD in the case with the supplied screws was problematical - the board inside the case is too deep and IDE HDD with the cable attached will not center over the holes in the unit's base. It is even worse using a SATA drive, consequently the HDD ends up lose inside a case which sits metal studs for feet - a recipe for disaster as the case moves around on any polished surface - bluTack will stop it flying across your desk."
1,don't bother,"I ordered two of these on ebay and they are complete garbage. If you are using the SATA connection, the wire does not bend enough from the board to the back of the drive, so the lid does not even fit flush. And if you try to tighten it, it pushes the adapter down onto the board, which intern presses on the fan causing it to not spin... woooo, wonderful design right there. really... even if its 6 dollars... don't bother."
4,Great Tech Person Tool,"I bought the Sabrent case after borrowing a friend's several times to help people recover data from IDE/SATA drives that would no longer boot or appeared to be dead. In conjunction with my personal collection of software recovery tools, I found this case to be a very handy way to safely pack a drive away and access it via USB instead of the old way of cracking open my computer box and fussing around inside there exposing my hardware to potential risk. The Sabrent case simply makes for a nicer work environment. If your a tech person and have clients coming into your work area, it also makes you look more professional."
4,Good bang for the $,"Ok for the price. IDE was easy setup. Lots of room, Win 7 found on first try. Sata set up? I havnt tryed yet.2 thumb screws on the bottom. But 4 threaded holes. As someone stated you can flip the logo plate over. Great minds think alike, thats exc. what I did. Good buy. I will get about 2 more esp. since my computer bit the big one. And Im now on a lap top. But I still can use my old HDDs!!"
3,lame ending,"This movie was made in 1990, however the special effects look circa 1982. For all you metalheads out there note that Anthrax provides the soundtrack. And... Joey Belladonna (lead singer of Anthrax at the time) plays the killer in this movie for a short bit. The killer's name is Acid Bath Sid. Plot: Guys pledge a frat and during hell week a pledge who was accidentally murdered 20 years ago comes to seek his revenge!"
5,i love them so much,immature is so great i don't care with they make i love them i have been to 2 live conserts with them an they are the best an batman is so fine an has the greatest voice an i wish he could sing to me someday
5,Contains everything you need!,"This is the most economical charcoal drawing kit out there that contains everything you need to start out making charcoal sketches. There is instruction on the package explaining what each kind of pencil and smudger is used for. It was my daughter's first ""real"" art kit and I was really happy it was inclusive of everything she needed to get started with charcoal sketches."
2,"Maybe for experimenting, but nothing professional.","It arrived fast but the quality was not worth it. Though the pencils say they are all different hardnesses, they all pretty much apply the exact same way. White pencil so hard that practically no color is shown. Kneaded eraser was tough and was difficult to clean. Very difficult to blend and make a base grey from which to pick up/add to."
1,"""Lukewarm"" about this game","I wasn't overjoyed with the drop game and my husband finds it boring... he liked the penguin game more but neither of us were in love with it. For the price it's not the worst PC game I've played but I probably wouldn't buy it again. I'm all about the puzzle games but this one just wasn't as much fun as I expected I guess. It's dark, it's kinda slow. I wanted more of a challenge... and I think my husband didn't like it because it was too much of a challenge, he said some of the colors look too much alike for him. You also have to have the disc in the computer to play it which annoys me about eGames products.Anyway, I don't recommend it but I don't hate the game enough to return it."
2,Not What I expected,My hand to eye coordination was a little to slow for this game. I was getting frustrated every time I played the game.
3,Drop!,"I received the game in a timely fashion, and it's okay. In all honesty, I never tried the game before I bought it, and it's not what I expected."
5,Robert E. Lee pictorial,"This Emory Thomas pictorial of Robet E. Lee is culled from loaned photographs from the Lee family archives and more. I highly reccomend this pictorial & essay from Emory Thomas to anyone with a keen interest of Lee. It is a perfect bedside reading companion to Dr. Thomas's earlier masterpiece on Lee and his character/life. For those who never had to chance to study under Regent Proffessor Emory Thomas- Emeritus at the University of Georgia or hear one of his lectures on Lee's final days,it is required reading for you. You will find it as a great investment of your time and money from cover to cover."
5,Easy to use!,These were a gift for Christmas. I had admired a friend's fitness level using walking poles so now I have these. They are a good alternative to 'just walking'. I am very happy with them.
5,Nordic walking poles,"It's like an outdoor ""elliptical machine"". Great workout. Perfect for hiking, yet works well around the track. Make sure it's tailored to your height."
5,Nordic Walking poles,I have used these several times on both sidewalks and trails. I especially like the weight bearing help going downhill as I have arthritis in my knees. This is a good product for walking with less pain.
1,Disappointed.,The item was broken ( not charging) then when we asked for replacement instead of sending us another one they refunded us the money.
1,"ists a poor product, don't buy, is no good compatible","I no recomend at all, for use in a single player,in my PS3 work, but have a too much ecco!!!!, watch It"
1,"Blue teeth, anyone?","Like most BlueTooth devices, this one sucks raw eggs.PS3 found it okay, (BT setup is a bit tedious on PS3) but as near as I can figure, it does not work."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,Terrible. Couldn't hear a thing except for high pitched feedback. Dont' waste your money. PS3 works with ANY bluetooth headset. I use one made for my cell phone and it works excellent. Find a better one.
1,Never worked -- Hate madcatz and gamestop,Received this piece as a X-mas present. When I plugged it in to charge the red light would turn on and then fade away. Would not charge. If it charged at all it never held the charge. Would not even turn on. Then Gamestop refused to give me my money back or credit because it was beyong the gift exchange date . . . I'm sorry I have been too busy with family and traveling to try my toy earlier Mr. Milliondollar Company. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM MADCATZ OR GAMESTOP AGAIN!!!
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! Will work poorly with RFOM,The sound quality was poor. If you don't mind messing with your headset every round then this headset is for you. I returned it and got a Jabra instead.
3,OK,"This product is hard to use, the power button doesnt even know what its supposed to do sometimes. Sound is clear though."
1,Not worth it!,"I bought this headset to play with Little Big Planet and Blur. Unfortunately the earpiece is very uncomfortable. There are sharp plastic pieces that stick out everywhere around the earpiece so I constantly had to mess with it. The loudest volume was so quiet that I had to turn off everything else in my house so I could hear anyone speak. I couldn't even have the volume of the game turned up at all. Every time I spoke to someone else, they complained about not being able to hear me as well. I have now had this product for just under 3 weeks and it just stopped working completely. At first when it started showing defects, I could get the blue light to flash like the headset was on, but it would not connect. Then after a day of that, the headset will no longer turn on at all. I don't understand why it quit working, but I will not be purchasing anything else from Mad Catz. Horrible product, so you get a horrible review."
2,Honest Review,The bluetooth was terrible. I bought it a few years back and took it back after a few weeks for store credit. It was crap and it only seemed to work well with Rainbow Six Vegas 2.
1,MadKatz Bluetooth for PS3,Very cheap earpeice (the folding part). It does not hold the headset to your ear firmly. I'd highly advise against this product.
2,Absolute Junk!!,Don't waste your money on this!! It doesn't work and is cheaply made! U get what you pay for.
2,ok,it is OK i guess my husband really don't like it because you have to connect it every time you turn on the ps3 and it was spouse to stop all the extra noise in the background but it doesn't but for the price i will not say anything you pay for what you get
1,Defective,"I purchased this product and it was defective...I sent it back and I got another one, which was defective too...I strongly recomend that no one buy it. However you may rest assured that Amazon has the greated return service in the world."
2,Not very good or reliable,"Purchased this for online gaming, not very good, not sensitive enough for people to hear if you speak at a normal volume and it does not sit snug enough against your face so you have to constantly adjust it for people to hear you."
3,confused?,i didn't purchase this off amazon but it is the same one. its very difficult to turn on/off or the mode that makes it detectable. i no longer have the instructions (like most people) so i just have to keep trying to push or hold the button until it does what i want. im unsure of the quality coming out of the ear piece because i have it set to play from my TV. it is very hard to try to use it while its plugged in because the weight of the cord is heaver then the ear piece. im thinking off purchasing one that wraps around your head.
1,Wow!.........,".....And not in a good way. I am with the other 25 or so reviews that this headset is an absolute pos. I got conned into buying it at a gamestop by the workers, I simply wanted a regular ps3 headset but they don't carry them. ??_?? Well it doesn't connect easily, wont hold a friggin charge and when it does connect it doesn't even work. I did however connect it to my phone and when I talked to ppl they got Pissed because they thought I was barely speaking when I would be screaming. Zero stars is my real rating but we all know amazon makes you give one star. AVOID THIS WASTE OF TIME MONEY AND EFFORT AT ALL COST!!!!"
1,waste of money,"I picked up this headset at Walmart since the foam padding on my old plantronics bluetooth headset was no more. I had no problems registering the unit with my PS3 and fired up Battlefield Bad company 2. I like the convenience of being able to charge via usb. However this is where the pros ends.Firstly the unit is NOT comfortable. You constantly feel the unit in and on your ear. I had to remove it more than a few times to check whether a piece of the rubber speaker component was torn and as a result protruding. Secondly the volume is terrible. I had to reduce the television volume to barely audible. The volume control on the headset was largely ineffective. In the end, I gave up and went back to my plantronics."
4,OFF THE HOOK,"Yo, I'm feeling this CD. One of the better R&B albums from new artists that I heard in a long time. I'm a producer for one of the major labels, based in California, which I will keep anonymous for excessive mail purposes. But you best believe, that I will be submitting this to the A&R Director of my company. I feel that who ever enjoys listening to good R&B music should buy this CD. Two Thumbs up to ""Lissen"", and good luck on the success of ""Turning Point""."
5,longtimelissener,"Lissen ranks up there with the rest of the best of the r&b groups. Turning point is as professional as anything out there. theyy are creative, and refreshing and dont rely on studio music. they can do it with a live band. outstanding cd, start to finish!"
1,Ostrich Egg video,very poor quality video that is very hard to watch. I would not recommend this to anyone who is a first time carver as they would probably become very discouraged with the idea of egg carving.
5,The Mind And (Bloody) Actions of John Brown,"Oates takes you into the mind of John Brown -- and what a disturbing place it is. You'll see John Brown well before the raid on Harper's Ferry. You'll see his early days as a man who has trouble providing for his family. You'll see his brutal terrorism in the new states. You'll see how he was funded. And yes, you'll experience the raid on Harper's Ferry, seemingly every muzzle-loaded shot of it, and some of its aftermath in the days leading to Civil War.If at all possible: visit Harper's Ferry West Virginia before (during or after) reading this book. It's a singularly moving place where history is still well preserved."
3,Stick to Windex & a Towel!,"I bought this item mostly to clean rental DVDs before putting them into my new DVD player. $10 seemed worth the risk. For my first use, I cleaned a particularly heavily-used DVD according to the instructions. The DVD did not look noticebly different afterwards, and upon playing the disc it skipped and was unplayable. I did another application with this product, and it still did not play. As a last resort, I sprayed the disc with Windex and used a lint-free towel to clean it. The disc played fine. Another time, I picked up a CD that was out of its case and had gathered dust and a couple of fingerprints. This device did a good job removing the dust and the light fingerprints. I still intend to use this product routinely to remove dust and grime on lightly soiled discs, but expect that it will be worthless when it is called upon to clean heavily used rental DVDs."
4,CD/DVD Cleaner,"This product works great but the battery compartment won't stay on mine and since it is spring loaded, I can't even get some tape to hold it on. I didn't want the huge of hassle of sending it back so I just deal with it."
4,Handy,This item is pretty handy for cleaning a lot of discs with toddler fingerprints on them. I haven't had any discs ruined using it.
3,"Nice...but,","Digital Innovations 60101 Motorized Disc Cleaner works well. I feel it could be improved by the addition of a ""START/STOP"" button. As it is sold now you end up getting finger prints on your disc trying to catch the spinning disc after it has been cleaned."
4,Recovered disc,I purchased 4 DVD's from Amazon & Ebay that would not play without freezing up. After cleaning with the Disc Cleaner 3 of the 4 played. Saving me scrapping 3 DVD's.
2,NOT as advertised!!!!!,"It was advertised as a 'high quality', relatively expensive disc restorer, BUT what I got was a cheap, over priced plastic washer (and it isn't much of a washer either)Oh, did I mention cheap?"
1,Did not work ever!,"Did not make a difference with any of my CDs, not even once. To be honest I think this product borders on false advertisement!"
1,doesnt do s***,"when i bought this product, i was under the impression that i could use it to clean my CDs and DVDs. i was sadly mislead. it didnt do didly squat. the disc was still dirty and all the product did was rotate the disc, nothing more. i would not recommend this to anybody who wants to clean/repair discs."
4,Good DVD cleaner for the price,The device worked fine for me and was a great price. It was a little difficult to determine what way the batteries went during the first installation.
5,Works Well!,"I find this works well for cleaning CDs, DVD, and game discs. If discs are scratched, you need a repair system. I have also used the Skip Dr. repair system with good success. Sometimes you need to run the disc through more than once, but the thing works!!"
2,LIMITED USE,It seems that I have reviewed this before. This book I would not buy again and will not suggest it. There a few general appeal recipes or anything else useful. Not again.
3,not as intristing as you would think but still entertaining,not as fasanationg or amazing but it is presented as a intristing maner Warnign: view before buying
1,Not what I expected.,"The bowl is the size of a cereal bowl, so much smaller than I had imagined. I had purchased a new one and received one that was obviously NOT new. It was chipped on the side and had gooey stuff on the inside of the bowl. I did also order a smaller one, that was new and decided to keep that one. I am using the smaller one to hold change and my keys. But obviously returned the larger one. The item is ok. I would not purchase it again."
2,Read the details...,"I was an idiot! I was drinking one night when I saw this bowl, and that is when I needed it! In my drunken stupor I was coherent enough to buy the largest of these bowls, I even got my wife excited thinking about a new salad bowl, or serving bowl. Unfortunately, the only thing you can serve in this thing are candy or nuts. It is way too small to be using it for anything else. Once again, it was MY stupid fault! The reason I'm rambling on here is because of the price. The product is not worth anything near $20. It is literally dyed plywood shaped into a bowl.... Is it nice for nuts, absolutely. Am I stupid for thinking something that was priced at $20 was anything as small as a cat food bowl, absolutely. Anyway, if you think it looks good and is worth it, then by all means, get it. Pleast note that it does not shine with that kind of glossyness in your home. Thank you for taking the time to read this, hope it helps!"
3,Small but nice to look at,"Well made and colours are gorgeous, unfortunately they are very very small; will just be a display rather than practical use"
2,Music CD,"Did not like her singing. Sorry I bought it. Pretty girl though. Not much else to say, say, say, say."
1,Disappointed,"Until now (1 month) I did'd receive this product.I am very disappointed, and I think I got the bad seller. Thanks."
2,DTS Sound Quality Poor,Pretty basic stuff. Sound poor quality 5.1. Would not buy if I had previously heard.
5,a fitting Tribute to a Great Talent,"I've always Respected Tina Turner&this Set showcases what makes Her on point as She is.solid tributes are given to her.She deserves all the Props She gets.I'm usually Hit&Miss with Her Studio stuff post ""Private Dancer"" through now but on stage Tina Brings the Pain&you are gonna know why She still commands as much respect as She gets.She is one of the Few Acts out now that I'd pay to go see Perform.Tina Turner is Timeless IMHO."
3,Okay if you wanna cure a 'Tina Jones'...,"...but by god, the steamiest of her most recent concerts has gotta be the one she did some 4-5 years ago in Amsterdam. Highlites of this show/DVD production is her renditions of Let's Stay Together and an adequate Nutbush City Limits (see Amsterdam show for a great Nutbush also). They interview folks like Keith Richards, Cher and David Bowie here to celebrate the greatness of la Tina on her 60th. The program shows that at 60, Tina still has great gams and she still can put on a great show. Every one else 'bout that age is looking for AARP discounts."
3,"Tina's Great, This DVD Isn't","This DVD features some kind words about Tina from other celebrities, along with a few good interview clips of Tina herself, but the musical performances are poorly produced and do not adequately showcase Miss Turner's amazing stage presence. While she is perfectly at home in the smaller venue, the audio is spotty at times and her vocals seem overpowered by the band. To really see Tina in action, check out the Wildest Dreams Live in Amsterdam DVD -- much greater bang for the buck."
1,Broke Quickly,"This item stopped working within 2 weeks of installation. I believe the problem is with the impeller, but nothing I did would make it work again. It is a total pain to setup too."
1,Did not work!,"This pump did not work when we recieved it, the impression was also that it had a light in it , it did not."
2,Rhythm of the Rain,I actually bought the CD for the title song which was good because none of the others were big hits although some were quite nice and representative of the 60s sound.
4,Cascades music,"For those who enjoy ""oldies"" and for just about anyone who enjoys ""real"" music, here's one you'll enjoy! Most of their music were ""hits"" to me. I do not have just one favorite hit. I think the whole CD was and still is enjoyable to listen to anytime."
2,It could have been better,"I bought this album because I totally loved one track that I knew: ""WEIRD OUT"". That song is great, and Dandelion has a different sound, but plain and simply, I couldn't really tell where one song ended and the next song began."
5,I heard a rumor,Love this record ! its still relevent today!!!I think the VINES may have listened to this album a few times???I heard a rumor in a chat room that Dandelion may release a new record in 2005? hope its true... buy this record if you dont own it already.
3,the flyind\g deese qoilt,I FEEL THE BOOK WAS OKAY BUT NOT GREAT THE PICTURES WERE DULL AND NOT INVITING. CLAD IT WAS ON SALE
3,Wrong item.,"I was bummed that it took over a month to receive this order, but I understand things happen. More bummed to open it and find the wrong Aztec logo, especially the one I disliked. I was sent the athletic symbol instead of the product pictured."
5,Great Movie,At first I didn't want to watch this movie because it was dealing with Saddam Hussein's son. But one of my friends told me give it a chance. So I got it on Netflix and I'm glad I took the chance. This movie is great. Dominic Cooper did an outstanding job playing both parts. I don't want to give anything away but if you take the chance like I did you'll be glad you did! 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!
5,Hassle free card!,"I've put this card in my T-mobile phone which has an mp3 player. Once I had this card in, the sync and storing was very fast and simple. I've had no problems so far and 1 GB memory will last me quite a bit."
4,Convenient Size,"The memory card was more than functional for what I use it for, and had no problems with setting it up with my camera and other consumer electronic products.The case that comes with the card makes it convenient to use and store on the fly."
4,Great Deal and Great Product,Works perfectly fine so far with my T-Mobile MDA smartphnoe. I got more space than I thought I would get. I got a great deal.
4,Kingston Technologies 1 GB MiniSD Memory Card,"no problems with product after 2 months, shipping was satisfactory."
3,Thought I was getting a MicroSD,"I ended up with a miniSD, I didn't pay close enough attention. Oh well it was cheap enough accept for the shipping charges."
1,"Lost in shipping, not replaced by Amazon","I ordered this card for my camcorder to tape my daughters first birthday party. It was ordered a full month before the party but I never received it. I emailed amazon, they said they would ship another, i never saw a new order or any flash card. Thanks amazon! Now customer no-service is telling my the replacement order was shipped over 2 weeks ago but it was not received either. I have order thousands of dollars worth of products from amazon and now they are going to loose a customer because of a 15$ memory card."
1,Horrible pillow!,"I have never written a review for a product before, but this pillow is such a waste of money that I had to let others know. I was having trouble sleeping on my side (as recommended in pregnancy), so I ordered this pillow. It is the most uncomfortable and bulky pillow imaginable. The size is insane to try to sleep with (never mind getting out of bed with it there). The velcro that puts the two pillows together rubbed my skin all night. After sleeping with this pillow for 2 nights, my back ached miserably and I am so overtired. I tried to make it work because I spent 72 dollars on it (after 2 day shipping), but I threw it out of bed last night at 3:00 AM after waking up with an aching back and a velcro scratch from this ""pillow."" HORRIBLE!"
1,Didn't like it - Leachco Body Double Maternity Pillow,"the pillows are really big, i have a cal king bed and the pillows took up more than half of the bed, leaving my poor husband squished off to the side and practically falling off the bed. the fabric on the pillow covers had already started to pill before I had even used it. was not impressed and returned the pillow."

3,not five lets be honest,"This PPV was pretty weak, the Flair/Henning match was a dream match but also a letdown. The rest of the mid card you could have seen on Thunder. The Cage Main Event was pretty silly with Savage doing an insane dive off the cage that i don't even think Foley of New Jack would attempt. Also a fan jumps the cage and some phony Stings break character and tackle him."
1,SKIP THIS ONE,"This DVD is so lame I traded in the first day I bought it. It doesn't even have any Penthouse Pets besides Nikie St. Gilles and Samantha Stewart which don't even get any scenes of their own ,they are just hosts of the show. Also most are your typicial models you see on the web(hence the name internet babes)and one model who caught my eye (Brooke) only had two scenes that were short."
3,Dino - European Style,"This cd is a compliation of two of Dean's Reprise LP's, Dean Martin French Style & Dino Latino. As always, Dean is in great voice, particularly on the French flavored songs. Some very lush songs stand out, particularly ""Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup"", ""April in Paris"", and ""Le Vie En Rose"". You can't go wrong with this as these Dino gems are not readily available anywhere else."
3,"Pretty good, but wrapped up a little too soon","I read this book for school in just a few days. It kept me interested, but when I was finished, I felt something was missing. There was a huge buildup to a not-so-substantial ending. I also thought that the information about Cocoa's relatives could have been less hidden. I also disliked the over-ly cheesy ""you will break his heart"" prophesy, which was literally fulfilled. But thats probly cause I'm not so much into that sort of thing. An entertaining book though."
3,Interesting...confusing,I'm still not sure how I felt about this book. There were some interesting literary references...although it seemed like they may have been too much to link with the multiple story lines. Connections were confusing and all over the place.
3,"""Mama Day"" shows true love is more than woman meets man.","Gloria Naylor takes a romance and infuses it with the magic and mystery and tragedy that accompanies true love. Set on a enigma of an island, with characters steeped in tradition and superstition, the heroine Cocoa and her great-aunt, Mama Day show the modern reader that love has no rules. Most applealing are the strong women charcters and mesh of modern and traditional. A book tinged with the fantastic; MAMA DAY should appeal to most readers looking for a non-traditional romance. MAMA DAY has strong politcal tones, lively social commentary, and yet still manages to warm the heart. Not a book that will revolutionize 20th century literature, but a good read for those interested in being challenged beyond the typical trash fed to women as romance."
4,connections within Naylor's writing,"I was given Mama Day in my book club and recommend it to anyone looking for a different kind of love story intertwined with family, superstition, black magic and daily life. I found it difficult in the beginning and had to re-read the first few pages to fully grasp the information being set forth. I've also noticed that Ms. Naylor uses references between her novels. George refers to a ""Bailey's Cafe"" which is the setting and title of another Naylor novel. I believe a sense of loss is felt when a well written novel is finished and I do feel as if I miss these characters."
2,Requires a lot of effort to follow the story!,"On a positive note, the book, characters, and plot were unique...definitely not your ordinary read. However, I found the book to sometimes be confusing and it was difficult to figure out who was doing the speaking early in the chapters. Additionally, I didn't care for all the supernatural aspects of the book. The book was not enjoyable to me because it required too much effort and back peddling to understand."
1,"If you are having trouble sleeping, read this book.","I was forced to read Mama Day for my English class and I have to say it is the most boring book we have read all year. I would try to read it, but the reading was so slow that I would fall asleep after a few pages. I recommend this book to all feminist, women, and people who do not like to take risks."
4,Interesting in more than one way!,"The book Mama Day was a very creative book. The sorcery that was represented in this book seemed to be old country knowledge. The main character Mama Day was full of wisdom because of all the things she encountered throughout her life. Gloria Naylor used many wonderful techniques in writing this book. This is an excellent Novel for anyone who enjoys a modern or contemporary book, or even a good love story. I wish that I could find out how Cocoa carried on with her life."
5,AN EXCELLENT AND ENCHANTING NOVEL!!!!!!,THIS IS A BOOK THAT I TOOK MY CHANCES ON AND I WAS GLAD THAT I CHOSE IT. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS THAT I HAVE READ IN MY 19 YEARS OF LIFE. HERE AT COLLEGE I USUALLY DON'T HAVE TIME FOR OUTSIDE READING BUT NOW IT'S ONE OF MY #1 PRIORITIES. THIS IS A BOOK THAT YOU'LL PICK UP AND WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT DOWN. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE MAGIC AND NATURAL DELIGHTS THAT THIS BOOK BROUGHT ABOUT.
5,"Love, Stormy Weather, Voo Doo -- It's All Here!","I read ""Mama Day"" for a book group I am in and it has become one of my all-time favorite books. Everyone in my book group loved it too. I have recommended it to friends who have also loved it. The relationships between the women and especially the magic -- and black magic -- captivated me, even though I usually don't like the ""supernatural"" in my fiction. It is an intelligently written book for intelligent people. I recommend it quite highly and without reservation."
5,Great memories,"In addition to all the episodes, this set includes the (unused) pilot, preview episode, and comments by Marlo Thomas today from which I learned some great trivia!"
5,Great Series for all ages!,I have been watching the series with my mom who used to watch the show when she was younger. It has been fun to watch the episodes for the first time. My mom said she always wanted to be That Girl and it is fun sharing that with her. Ann Marie is great!
4,Awful Commentary!,"Very disappointed with the awful commentaries on this DVD set. Marlo Thomas was apparently watching them for the first time, couldn't seem to remember the episodes at all, and sounded so ""unperky"" - in vast contrast to her character. Has she never heard another commentary done on another show? This was terrible. They should go back and redo them! (Someone should have mentioned that Ted Bessell had died and that's why he wasn't included!)"
5,THAT GIRL (1966 - 1971),"TED BESSELL,WILL ALWAYS BE WITHIN OUR HISTORY BOOKS. That Girl,And Marlo Thomas Would Not Be The Same WithoutTed Bessell as Donald Hollinger."
3,Great memories; commentaries weak,"The release of these DVDs bring back some great memories; however, I was let down a bit by Marlo's commentaries. I realize that, forty years on, she has quite a body of work behind her; yet as a fan you wait to hear such things as, ""I remember this scene!,"" or ""I remember Ted Bessell did this during shooting this scene..."", but she speaks about Ann Marie in the 3rd person, occasionally pointed out some dresses she liked, or that, ""Teddy Bessell was so thin then."" Her commentaries seem to suggest she has no independent recollection of the shows, so in that sense it will be a let down for fans and you may question the value of the commentaries."
5,Marlo the Magician,"Season 2 has a better opening than Season 1. Marlo Thomas had the rare talent to act over-the-top and not look like a ham doing it. She's an amazing actress, one of the most underrated ever, in my opinion. I also have never viewed her feminism as being ultra-liberal or mean-spirited, just seeking justice and equal rights for women. As a 44-year-old man, I view her as a visionary. The acting and script-writing for this series was awesome. Lew Parker - what an incredible actor he was. Ted Bessell was sensational, and Mabel Albertson - wow! One of the great old shows - they don't make them like that anymore. Actual stories in each episode, instead of one little theme with cheap attempts at sexual humor and cranked-up laugh tracks every five seconds on today's sitcoms."
4,A nice look back - she hasn't changed much physically over the years!,"Marlo was a sweetheart in those days and this is a fun look back to those early days.When you compare her looks from then to now she hasn't changed much physically over the years!Now please release the short-run, but classic series 'Hazel' with Shirley Booth on DVD - she was a beauty in another way..."
5,"""Oh Donald""!",Why is Lou Marie always lurking outside his daughter's apartment door? Who is running the restaurant back in Brewster? Is there really a restaurant back in Brewster? Is Lou dillusional?
4,Relatively balanced and readable history,"As the title of the review states, this is a fairly readable and balanced history of the civil rights movement. I give it four stars because I feel a few sections became unnecessarily long and drawn out. This was assigned reading for a political science class I took, but I don't regret reading it. Some of the stories are more attention-grabbing than others, but all are worthy of our time."
5,merry christmas to you,reba mcentire merry christmas to you arrived in perfect shape i love it .i do highly recomend this site to everyone.thanks
5,Amazing Love,"This is one of the Hosanna Integrity of that moment. In those days the songs were ""Jesus-centered"". These days most of what they call worship songs are nothing but emotional reflections of the writers struggle. They have been progressively getting more and more ""man-centered"". This is why these old HM albums are such a treasure. ""Amazing Love"" introduced me to Graham Kendrick and it is highly recommended."
4,BOOK REVIEW,"I enjoyed the story. It's a man in trouble kind of thing. I've driven down to Sedona a couple of times, so found that fun also. Usually I like longer books but this one worked for me."
2,Basic Overview,"Ordered this book in preparation for a trip to Madagascar. A waste of money. A very minimal overview of the animals of Madagascar, not an in depth guide. Was looking for something much more comprehensive."
5,You will want to already be there!,A wonderful and very complete book. Very useful to determine where you want to go once in the country; will give you in-depth information on the animals. You need to buy this to keep on dreaming!
4,Very helpful,"I am planning a trip to Madagascar and found this book a very helpful review of the various parks in the country. The photos are excellent and the discussion of the various mammals are readable but provide enough information to be interesting. This is not a technical book on either mammals or ecosystems, but is a good review of both. Perhaps I was looking for too much from this book, but I would have liked more maps and a bit more guidance on how to combine trips to different ecosystems in one trip. I combine it with the Lonely Planet and can cobble together the information, but it requires quite a bit of work. I also liked the sections on reptiles and insects - many books neglect the little creatures, which can be far more interesting than mammals in some ecosystems. Overall highly recommended."
5,Madagascar Wildlife Book is excellent,"This book is a great introduction to Madagascan Wildlife - it gives a breakdown of the main National Parks and Reserves and what you are likely to see at each. Another section provides (limited) details of the Madagascan fauna. While I would have liked some more detail, for the price and size it is a fantastic introductory guide."
5,Courtship Quilts: Inspired by the Victorian Language of Flowers,"Very explicit instructions for these moderately difficult quilts. I enjoyed the step by step explanations, the obvious research into the history of Victorian flowers, and of course, the beautiful quilts. Ms. Sheppard is a design and color maven!"
2,Salt and spices,"I'm no native, but I've spent several weeks in India and have definitely sampled lots of dal. This is overly salty, and the cardamom is a bit overpowering as well. I don't recommend it."
5,Think you know Marilyn?,"Adam Victor does! This book is fantastic, no Marilyn fan or Hollywood trivia buff should be without it. The photos that accompany the text offer as much of a look into the life of Marilyn Monroe as the meticulously researched and cross-referenced, A-Z reference guide that puts little known facts at your fingertips. Buy this book, you won't regret it."
2,IT DOES NOT CELEBRATE THE WOMAN,"I AGREE WITH A COMMENTER THAT THIS BOOK HAS NO RELIABLE SOURCE OF TRUTH TO THE LIFE OF MARILYN MONROE AND IT HAS SOME TYPOS IN SENTENCE STRUCTURE. A WRITER SHOULD BE ABLE TO REVISE AND REVISE CAREFULLY FOR ERRORS. IF YOU READ THIS BOOK YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO TELL WHAT IS FACTUAL AND WHAT IS NOT. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT AN EXCELLENT IDEA TO INCLUDE ANOTHONY SUMMERS OR DONALD SPOTO FOR INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW HER PERSONALLY. THE BOOK CONSTANTLY MENTIONS ABOUT THE NUDE CALENDER, WHILE I GET THE IDEA ALREADY. THE AUTHOR LIKES TO INSULT THE INTELLIGENCE OF THIS MISUNDERSTOOD WOMAN. IT IS SAD THAT GREEDY PEOPLE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE MEMORY OF MARILYN MONROE EVERY YEAR SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF HER. THIS BOOK IS PACKED WITH GOSSIP, BUT THE ONLY THING I CAN AGREE WITH IS THAT THE PICTURES ARE NICE."
2,Dissapointed,"i was hoping this book would contain better pictures of marilyn's most famous outfits from her movies. being a costumeri like to have full shots, that are large enough to see details.this book didn't have that, most pictures are small, one to two inch. with a few full page pictures thrown in. most are just head shots though. it does list what movie, or event the pictures came from and all sorts of other info. so for a refrence book it's not bad."
1,Mad Catz wireless controller,"Unfortunately the product is defective, it does not work properly one of the handles moves on its own. Not very reliable, sorry."
3,Peridot Ring,"This ring is smaller than I thought it would be. The stone is pretty, but the silver is pretty thin and flimsy. I would not have bought this ring if I had known it would look as cheap as it does."
5,Very Pretty!!,"Sparkly, dainty, wear it with casual or dressy clothing, matches anything green. I love it."
1,History of Hampton/ Unreadable.,"I am disappointed! I am familiar with this book and know some of it by heart, but cannot read the passages due to poor copy quality.Also, no maps were included. I had hoped the maps (of early Hampton residence locations and showing where the town of Hampton was in it's original, more spread out area) would be there as they are in the original Dow's History of Hampton.,I've been very busy with work and guests, or I would have returned it by now."
2,Not a true Penthouse Video,"There are some incredibly beautiful women in this video but they are wasted, due to a jumpy camera person who wouldn't dare shoot below the equator. You'll see more skin in some of the more recent Playboy videos. Obviously produced by someone else for Penthouse. Buy the 2001 Pet-Playoff instead."
4,women working,"some beautiful stunners in this dodgy shot penthouse classic,certainly worth watching for samantha stewart alone.Add it toyour collection.Impressive!"
4,Shark Bite Fittings,"Easy to use fittings make plumbing a snap. Especially nice to use where soldering is difficult -- such as replacing installed worn-out valves, fittings or pipe. Price was right on Amazon versus the huge box-store. Plan ahead as you wait to get these -- took 2 weeks to fulfill my order."
1,"Manos, hands of fate or Blood Feast... hmm...","Pardon the header... just trying to decide which would be the all-time worst film I've seen. Now, just because I rate a movie with one star doesn't mean it has no value whatsoever. I actually had a good time laughing at it (considerably more fun than Manos). The dialogue and performances are hands-down the worst you will ever see, and the soundtrack is either cheesy organ music or slow, methodical drum-banging. You would think it's all intentionally bad, but I'm not so sure... fun slice of ineptitude from the early 60s."
1,Just plain stupid.,"Every now and then you see a movie and you have wonder if anyone out thought this was a good film. This is one of the worst films ever made. A stupid film with bad acting, writing, etc...The lack of action,acting, plot and consistancey is just too much for this film to overcome. Watching this movie is at times really amusing becouse it's just so bad. A lot has been made of this one becouse it was the first ever 'Gore' film ever. With movies like Dawn Of The Dead, Demons, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare On Elm Street it is in some good company, however for every Dawn of the Dead there is a Pieces. So on the fact that it was the first of that era I will give it it's due respect. That however is where it ends. Maber we never would have had Friday 13th if not for this film, I don't know but I must say that the movies got much better in this field...."
2,Beyond Gruesome,"This film is a bit of a disappointment. Despite a fair amount of unintentional humor (some examples of which are truly hysterical) the relentlessly graphic misogynistic death scenes make the film more disgusting than entertaining. A subtitle to the film could be MORONS WITH CAMERAS as it is ultimately a profoundly stupid, infantile film. It's definitely worth a look at least for shock value but isn't the romp many would have you believe. Jackie Kong's spoof of BLOOD FEAST, BLOOD DINER, is a much better bet if you are looking for fun gory psychotronic entertainment. Best scene in BLOOD FEAST: Ramses trying to decapitate the ugly Suzette."
1,"Boring...with bright red paint, that is susposed to blood","Alright to start out this review I wanna add that I respect this movie becuase of the year, it was probally the sickest movie in that time period, but now in 2004 it seems that movie has an attempt to try to gross out its audiences. It didn't work for me becuase I felt that the killing scenes we dull and boring. Not to metion the fact the color of the blood was so bright red, paint red, and the acting was terribal. so terribal it seemed like the acters were reading their scipts while being filmed, it was so bad. The main acter, killer guy looked like Kramer from seinfeild.Now...... I can't give this movie all bad reasons, there were some things that were alright, and that was the storyline, But the main psycho guy, did a terribal job acting like he believed in egpytion Gods. So thats it...... Just the storyline that was alright. The rest was absolutly, positively, boring...................Lot of Love, John............"
1,You Idiots!,"This is so terribly disgusting. Nobody needs to watch this gory movie. Why are audiences so entertained by watching a deranged maniac slicing up women. This movie was definetely made for a bunch of braindead mysoginists who find this entertaining, and maybe a couple of sex offenders. This along with ""Blood Sucking Freaks"" should be banned. They should have released a single-disc edition of ""Star Wars"" instead. Yeah and I'm sure that there are plenty of mysoginists on here ready to be entertained by watching a psycho mutiliating women. And I don't really care how many people do not find this review helpful. I don't even care is 1,000 people don't find this review helpful or even a million. If you are a fan of this movie you will definetely hate my guts. But if you are willing to get something else, then maybe you should buy something else. And pardon me for being narrow-minded but I fail to see why a deranged maniac slicing up women is so ""fun."""
1,Not a very Good Movie no matter how you compare it!!!!!,"Don't fall for the hype of some of the fan boy reviews of this movie, it is a poor slasher movie, poor gore movie, and just a bad overall film. Don't waste your money on it, it's so bad you would never think of this movie as gore, the blood looks like red paint, it is also very short at 67 minites, not that matters, since you will be glad it's over. there are alot of other horror films you can buy that are far surperior to this movie, it's not even funny in an Ed Wood, kind of way."
3,"If you like bad, here it is!","Wow! This movie is ONLY for people who like bad hollywood movies, and i'm not talking about something that just dissapioints you! I'm talking about something that is just bad all over the place! And yet, the strange thing about this movie is that once you watch it, you have this strange affinity for it. it's so bad, that you end up liking it! The acting is horrible (except for Fuad Ramses's line: ""... an Egyptian Feast!!!"") the writing is just a bad, it sounds like they filmed some of the scenes in a tin box (the police station) and how old is that detective? and he's going out with her? Yikes. Also, the music is the most eerie thing i've ever heard in a movie. it's always there. did you ever notice that they only have one car in the movie? Everyone drives the same car! The chase scene at the end is great. if you enjoy bad movies, this one is definitely for you!"
5,Surprise : A Reprise Two-For!,"Although there are no liner notes to say so, this is actually a complete reissue of Dean's second and third LPs for Reprise (""Dean ""Tex"" Martin - Country Style"" from 1962, and ""Dean ""Tex"" Martin Rides Again"" from 1963). The arrangements here are a little more restrained than the thumping countrypolitan hits that would follow later, which is good. 24 tracks (62 minutes), and very good sound. This CD is listed as out of stock, but shows up occaisionally in shops and from other vendors. Grab it if you see it!"
4,"Fun, but wear your shoes!","My children were 4 and 6 years old when they got this for Christmas and they thought it was fun. It wasn't that hard for them to stomp, but wear your shoes!"
1,AVOID - This was a big disappointment,"This was a BIG disappointment for Christmas 2001. My boisterous 4 and 6 year old boys were UNABLE to put enough pressure on the spiders to register any points. Naturally, they quickly lost interest. This game had a lot of promise but IN NO WAY lived up to expectations. This is on the way back to Toy-R-Us as we speak."
1,"Sounds great, not so great.","This sounded like fun. But the spiders are raised up and you really have to stomp hard. The kids NEED shoes for this and must stomp them hard to earn the points which aren't very acurate by my count. The kids do love to try though, so for an older child it might be fine."
2,More Jonathan Bould!,Jonathan Bould carries this film. His interpretation of a Western Businessman marked for execution by a Ninja is cinematic brilliance. This film needed more of Mr. Bould and less of the Aussie voice overed Asian actors. Subtitles would have helped this film immensely.
5,Persuasive advice for lawyers,"In Legally Speaking, Mr. Dempsey has created an invaluable guide for lawyers, and I suspect non-lawyers, who need to make presentations to small or large groups. His observations about the art of persuasion are both amusing and insightful. As Dempsey makes clear, talking is not the same as presenting. His focus on ""making your case"" gets right to the heart of what lawyers do for their clients. Dempsey really wants you to win your audience over and tells you quite clearly how to achieve that goal. Dempsey's comprehensive approach (40 principles!), covers every aspect of lawyers' presentation skills, but still leaves you with one unanswered question: ""Can you do a book for non-lawyers?"""
4,Well Worth It ... IF you are smart about it,"I read the reviews & people said it would tear ... but for $10 & it def. does its job ...why not? If you're gonna buy the product you will lose excess water weight etc etc .... my only advice is to treat this product very delicately ... I'm sure it can tear if your blazing thru the forest & running through the brush like a mo-mo but if you stay on the treadmill, buy one size larger than your normal wear you will be fine ... I bought 2 sets & rotate them ... work out 5 days a week with them , never had a problem ... I don't use it while lifting weights ... the suit makes you look like McHammer.... other than that I am very delighted with the results, product, and price."
5,works well,"I'm 6'4 and approx. 230 lbs and the size XXL -XXXL is a little too big. The top is OK, however pants are really huge and you will look like MC.Hammer. I just wear a t-shirt, slimmer belt and boxer shorts underneath it. Sometimes I put something on top like a baggy hooded sweatshirt and baggy cotton sweatpants, because otherwise you will really look like an idiot in these pants. Or like a fisherman. Whatever. Anyway they work great and you will feel it after 15 minutes of work out. After first training in those (50 minutes on a treadmill) I was soaking wet. So it really does work. For the price you can't go wrong with this product."
5,thermal suite review,This product works great and the sizes are a little bigger than the size says which is great because you dont have to worry about it fitting cause it will!!!! There is one down side and that is that the material is a little bit delicate so becareful not to snag on anything because it will rip. Other than that from a scale of 1-10 i give it a nine.
2,Piece if JUNK and runs way to big,Buy at least a size smaller then you think. It is way too hard and makes movement difficult. Buy something better.
1,sizes are off,You have to be careful when ordering these because the sizes are off and either you'll get them to small or to big. I ordered it twice before I got the right size. If you have access to a sauna I highly recommend you do that instead.
3,Very basic guitar arrangements,"It is a nice book to have if you are a Hank Willams fan like me. The flat & finger picking arrangemnts are very basic and simple. It is easy to follow and great for beginners.If you are a more accomplished guitar player and are looking for a book that helps you to play exactly like Hank or sound like Hank William's band, you may be a little disappointed.I wish Sokolow could show us the exact chords Hank used and included guitar fill-ins and breaks by Hank's band to give us the flavor of Hank William's original recording. Hopefully someday Fred or someone else will do this for us."
3,Hank Williams Songbook,"This book of songs by hank williams is nicely done and would make excellent material for those learning flat picking and finger picking. The music is very well laid out in both music notion and tabs for both styles for each song. The finger picking tabs are very clear and well done. If you are looking for a Hank Williams song book where you want to sing and stumm the songs, then put in instumental breaks in between verses, this book is for you. The words are all there with the music. This is a really nice book, I have been playing Hank Williams stuff for twenty years and think this is a nice book."
1,*****WARNING*****NOT ACCURATE*****,"This tab book is not accurate to the original recordings. If you're wanting to own Hank Williams material in its original form, you'll be very disappointed with this book. It's even basic for beginners. Would not recommend to anyone."
2,SoSo Book,"This is an ok book for the Ultimate BEGINNER, But is generallyinsulting to the intelligence with any SLR experience!"
4,Excellent though brief.,"This is an excellent though brief summary. It lacks the details necessary for the serious learner about the Nikon D70. For a quick rundown for the beginner, for this camera, it is quite good."
2,"Nice Pictures, Bad Book","This book looks very slick, and has good photos of the camera, but I have a camera so I don't need photos of it. The content is generally worthless, and occasionally incorrect.It covers pretty much every subject I have a question about, though answers none of them. You know it's bad when it starts with how to charge the battery.Not even worth the $5."
2,50 odd pages of sparse information,"But probably suitable for folks who absolutely cannot wait to use their D70s and find the Nikon manual too intimidating. At best, one realizes, whoa, there's a lot stuff to remember! At some point one would have to refer to the manual to fully understand what Mr Gregory does not elaborate on. And if you can afford that excellent camera, you should skip to the D70 manual to fully appreciate everything the D70 offers. I say don't spend the 5 bucks this if you are seriously considering using the D70 for more than an expensive automatic point and shoot. I give it 2 stars however for whetting one's appetite wanting for more."
2,"Very small price, very small value","After reading this book cover to cover, I had picked up only one shortcut button sequence and no tips or tricks. This is a good book for someone who has never picked up a digital camera or an SLR camera before (if you're used to a normal 35mm camera and need to learn both digital and SLR at once you'll be overwhelmed and this can help you). The pictures are good and the explanation is simple enough, but if you've used a digital or an SLR you can pick most of this information up without a book. It didn't go into anything that was difficult to understand. I bought the book before the camera and learned nothing from it, so I can imagine that if I had the camera first I wouldn't even have bothered buying the book."
1,"So I figured, what do have to lose?","It's only five bucks. Well, I lost five bucks. Don't bother buying this book. If you bought a D70 and you need this book to figure out how to work it, you should have bought a disposable camera. Do you really need this book to tell you to turn the ring on the lens to zoom? If you're sitting at home with your $1000 camera in your lap waiting for this book to arrive so you can learn how to zoom your camera, then this book is for you. Overnight it if you have to. Otherwise, don't buy the book, send me four dollars so I can enjoy a cup of coffee at Fourbucks. At least one of us will get something for your money and you would have saved a dollar. It's a win-win."
4,It's 5 dollars,"It's basic, but it's 5 dollars. It's a nice little basic intro book that is easy reading."
5,When Scott Hall won the Sixty Man-Three Ring Battle Royal.,It was just the NWO and just Lex Luger.One by one the Nwo was getting aleminated by Lex Luger.It just came down to Lex Luger and Scott Hall.Lex Luger tryed his best to win it but buy the end of the Sixty Man-Three Ring Battle Royal Scott Hall aleminated Lex Luger at the end and won the World War 3 Sixty Man-Three Ring Battle Royal.
4,Celebrating ten years of Wild Mango,"Many bands, finding themselves celebrating ten years of performing and recording, would issue a compilation album drawn from past recordings with maybe one or two new songs. Wild Mango instead have recorded a nine-song set of great new tunes that show where they are in their musical journey today.What a rich and varied journey it is, too. Produced by the band, along with Celso Alberti and mixed by Gary Mankin, the CD takes elements of Brazilian, Latin, Jazz and funk and creates a diverse and exciting set of music that jumps out right from the beginning.I've had the pleasure of following the band since 1995, and this is their best recording yet. Its infectious energy, crisp production and exciting arrangements make listening a pleasure."
5,Are you local???,"As an avid fan of the LOG via Comedy Central, I was shocked to read some of the British fan sites of the show to find out that Comedy Central had edited the shows! I was disappointed see that I wasn't getting clean, pure and local episodes!!! After praying, along with other fans, on the BBC chat board about rumors of a video release...I was pleased to find it on Amazon! I've had my DVD preordered for about a month now & I'm counting the seconds until it arrives on my doorstep.Kudos to BBC, BBC America, Warner Bros. and Amazon for making this possible!!!"
1,A great show destroyed in its U.S. release,"I saw this show on the original UK DVD release, where there was NO LAUGH TRACK!!! This show is brilliant, but it's not meant to have an audience laughing along with it. The laugh track completely destroys the entire atmosphere of the show and is altogether distracting and annoying.Don't buy the U.S. release. Buy the UK release and watch it on a computer or a region free DVD player."
5,One of the Best British Comedy Trios Around!,"Comedy certainly took a new turn when Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and Reece Shearsmith came on to the scene. These three actors plus Jeremy Dyson (the Producer) create The League of Gentlemen.This is the first series from the BBC and it is a real good treat! Join the three as they perform hilarious sketches as different characters in the local town of Royston Vasey. Everything that you don't expect to happen in a small villiage town, happens here. It is a brilliant comedy mixing humour with horror and is well worth watching.I think it only appeals to some people and not to others. When I first watched it I thought it wasn't that funny, but after watching it again and again, I thought it hilarious!I own series one and two over here in England and hope they make a third!Hope you like it!"
4,surreal vasey,"The league of gentlemen gas been on British tv for some time. It has it's own collective of loyal fans and has become a cult classic.If you like the bizzareness of python then you will like it. It's original, British humour at it's best."
4,Unique and bizarre - and worth the time,"League of Gentlemen is a production that is very hard to describe without making many people to decline to watch on principle.Big mistake.I enjoyed season one very much indeed. It is ""an audacious blend of bizarre humor and horror"" but that does not serve to adequately describe its delight. The characters are memorable and well-performed throughout, and the tone of the show is spot on.If you have the sort of mind that is bendable and willing to seek out the strange perimeters of humor by all means give it a go. I guarantee that you haven't seen anything quite like it."
3,Would be a 5 if it didn't come with that infernal laugh track,"I honestly love this very dark comedy, but the laugh track (and it's obviously painful it's a laugh track) really hurts. There are so many unique characters that make for an extremely interesting watch. Please, BBC, if it's in your power, get rid of the laugh track and re-distribute. Still, even if you have to put up with it, worth the watch, just a shame it's there. I own all the seasons, (only 3, and I believe it's only 19 episodes)and if I'm not mistaken (and God hope I'm not), in the second season, they dropped the damned canned laughter. I'll update once I get there. To all of those shows that have canned laughter, give us the option to turn it off. I'm smart enough to know what is sad, what is funny, and what makes me go ""Awwww.."". Until then, anyone know where I can watch Season 1 the way it should be watched? Leave feedback, please."
5,This is a must see if you are 'local'.,This show must be based on the real life characters. Those weird 'local' people are ourselves with only a little bit dirstortion.This is the best comedy show ever!
5,No-tails...precious things...we'll have no trouble here!!!!,"Utterly bizarre...utterly compelling..unfair, unjust, unremorseful 'comedy' that grabs you by the knackers and drags you down an unfinished 'New Road' of unpleasant delights culminating in doom, pathos and nose-bleeds. Confused? You don't know the half of it. These three actors are jaw-dropping. This show is NOT TO BE MISSED."
5,"Sick, twisted, and incredibly funny","My wife won't let me watch this DVD when she is in the house. I also find much of this program to be disturbing. But it is also very, very funny. I am constantly amazed by the skill of the principal actors/writers who are able to create and portray incredibly detailed and interesting characters. If you have a strong stomach, and like to laugh, this is a great DVD to buy.BTW, after inquiring to BBC America, they told me that they currently have no plans to release season 2 in the States. C'mon BBC, give the people what they want: Season 2!!!UPDATE MAY 18, 2005: I've seen that BBC now has plans to release all three seasons of League of Gentlemen, plus the Christmas special, in a single box set. In such a character driven show, I can't wait to see how it all wraps up. . . FINALLY!!!"
5,Bloody marvellous,"The funniest thing you will ever watch, especially if you are local!!! (i am, i was born in Derbyshire)"
4,"Okey Kokey, pig in a pokey","Dark, twisted, frightening and very funny.Buy this video.You have been warned."
5,HELP!!!,Where can I find the DVD of League of Gentlemen Volume II? I can't find it anywhere except on a British website and their DVD won't play with US DVD players. Please help me.
1,Brilliant Show - Marred by Laugh Track,"This is indeed a brilliant show...I enjoyed it very much when I first rented it on VHS. Unfortunately, the producers opted to add a laugh track to the DVD version, which in my opinion ruins the subtle and dark humor of the series. I'm sending my copy back."
3,If you loved The Royal Tenenbaums don't buy this,"I almost bought this DVD based on 3 amazon related things: it being recommended as an alternative to buying The Royal Tenenbaums, it's perfect 5 star rating and user comments that slather it with compliments like 'I laughed to tears.' ...Two problems struck me immediately; the video quality of the show and the odious laugh track. I thought only Americans needed reminding of when to laugh. And the show can be funny but not nearly as funny as the laugh track's gut busting cackles would have you believe. Hey and let me guess, will she say it, yup, 'Are you local?' and wait for it... 'This is a respectable town.' It's funny, like 'I'm with stupid -->' t-shirts. In conclusion, the League of Gentlemen is not the wry, dead pan humor or wit of a Wes Anderson film. But another less refined and surfaced comedic beast."
1,How could they do this?,"I became a Popinjays fan from their EP ""Vote Elvis!"" that came out in 1991, but I liked their 1992 self-titled album even better. Their sound was lively and cheerful, perfect for sunny summer days. Their 1992 album, in fact, is a must-listen-to when I go to the beach! Liking their first two albums so much, I bought this album with great anticipation. What a massive disappointment. It is extremely mellow and depressing, a complete departure from their earlier stuff. What was that for? Why throw away their exciting, melodic music for this dull piece of junk?"
1,... Bucks? NO NO NO,"I&#65533;ve been told that the Popinjays are intended to be annoying, well, they have succeeded."
2,absence of presence,"reads like the transcript of a rambling interrogatory,rather than a novel. an under-employed actor/lawyer,whose chief talent seems to be bluster, blunders through a murder trial. near total lack of descriptive qualities.unusual though below average contribution to legal fiction."
2,"Short on disaster footage, long on special effects.","I was expecting to see exciting footage of actual disasters, but instead was presented with a miasma of gratuitous special effects, e.g., ""the earth"" that looked suspiciously like a beach ball, and images that quickly zoomed into a ""paintings on the wall"" motif. I thought the filler part of the video was overdone. Sorry."
4,Sunroof Wind Deflector for Toyota Camry 2007-08,"Perfect product, looks great and the price can't be beat. Installation was very easy, although the directions could have been a little more detailed."
3,As expected,"This is a nice deflector and of quality workmanship. However, I did not like the overall shape compared to the photo. Installation was easy but needed two people."
4,just a little...different.,"Great book, reminded me of Frankenstein in ways, Jane Austen in others. Read this one, then read A Clockwork Orange - it could be a continuation of this story."
3,"Exciting book, but I have only fair lasting impressions","I read The Fifth Child several years ago for a school assignment. I remember being very into it and not being able to put it down. I kept thinking, this book is such a thrill, how could it have been on my class list? I'm sure I was able to pull together some obvious themes in the paper I wrote, but the truth is this: In the end, after having read dozens of books of various genre over the years, this one is not one that stands out in my mind. I cannot recall any one particular thought or conclusion that I had upon reading it. To me, it simply was a chilling story of a mother with a congenitally freaky child."
3,Look into it....,When you read this book you see into a world that that may be reality for some. Although it didn't really capture me...it made me think that there are people out there that may go through this. Harriet and David had a good life before this and once the baby came it changed them...they were not ready for it. 'all sunshine makes a desert'.
2,The fifth child,Read it in a day hoping for it to get better and was sadly disapointed. The ending lacked everything. I would not waste your money.
5,A gripping and compelling story,"We read this book for a book club meeting. Boy, was it a charged session! I loved the book. I thought the writing style itself was original and amazingly gripping. The story was very provocative and led to a number of differing views and interpretations of the situation. It is a relatively short and easy read, but a bit disturbing. I thought it was great."
3,The Fifth Child,"The book by Doris Lessing was by and large a disappointment. It attempted to portray a middle-class family with ambition to have as many children as possible. The first four were normal; the fifth was strange in appearence. None of the characters were fully developed, so it was difficult to feel for any of them. The fifth child, although developmentally challenged, had the potential to be the central character of the book, yet he was described mainly through his primitive actions, not inner feelings. The theme that the fifth child's behavior could have been the result of not being loved was not developed. Indeed, the insinuations of his many misdeeds were probably false. So, the book is not deep enough in the portrayal of the characters or their actions."
5,Haunting and hard to forget,"I read this book when it was first published in the late 1980's and I've never forgotten it. This novel is disturbing on so many levels that it's hard to know where to begin. The family dynamics are intense and it's hard to place blame. Society's tolerance for 'special' individuals was just emerging and punitive treatment was still the norm. And, what do you do with this child? The things this child did were beyond the pale. These were not learned behaviors. He was the only one. He was the 5th child. I loved this book. I don't think I will ever forget it."
3,"Frightening, scary and quite boring","I had actually expected more from this book, I guess I had too high expectations. Even though the story was exciting enough, it was not really frightening or scaring. I was waiting for something more all the time, but it just didn't happen.Still, an enjoyable book. Some good points which made me think about the consequences our choices have. I guess Harriet didn't really have any choices, whatever she decided, the consequences would be fatal..."
1,offensive references to people with Down Syndrome,"I recently purchased this book, but was surprised to read a number of offensive and derogatory references to people with Down Syndrome. It was not that great of a read to begin with, and when I came across the second negative paragraph I put my kindle down and returned it to Amazon. No great loss on my part, the book did little to develop the characters. Within the first few chapters, Harriett and David went from meeting to having their 3rd child. I felt no bond for any of the characters, and really didnt care to read the rest. I would not recommend this book."
2,I read it but its not all that!,Ok I read this book but I barely made it through. I thought it was OK. Thats it just ok.
1,Beware of The Fifth Child.,"I was obliged to read this novel for one of my college literature classes. This book is just another example of a post-modern novel: Glum, non-nourishing and a waste of precious tree resources."
2,Disappointing.....,"I started reading this book because it was voted as being one of the best reads of the year. Initially, after reading the description, I thought it was going to be a little bit like Rosemary's Baby with a twist. Quite honestly, the book seemed to never get good? Does that make sense? As you read, you keep thinking that something interesting is going to happen, but it never does. The ending is absolutely horrible. First, I read the last chapter again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Then, I searched the Kindle store because I thought for sure there was a sequel of some kind, but no dice. Don't get me wrong, the book was not good enough to warrant wanting to read a second part, but it ended so bad I thought for sure there had to be something else. I read the entire book so I felt obligated to rate it two stars."
1,not believeable,"Reminded me of the haunted house movies where you just want to say, ""Move out, already!"" But the characters just keep on repeating stupid mistakes. The mother in this book was constantly doing stupid things, ignoring reality. Who lets a small child hang out with older kids as a 'pet'?"
3,Good,"This uncanny novel manages to be many things. A spooky tale of a warped child, who is abnormally large, cruel and unfeeling. A frank treatise on the perils of modern parenting. A wise and startling rumination on the ""bad seed"" concept that in past decades as been a tasty current in modern debate. Lessing expertly hones in on the mixed feelings of an otherwise succesful mother who has recently born a child who quickly becomes a terror to his family and later a threat to the world. A realist horror story that satisfies to the last syllable."
2,"Great music, lousy sound",Love Mark-Almond. But I was thoroughly disappointed with the audio quality of this download on my high end system. Not even approaching cd quality. Unlike any other download I have purchased through Amazon.
4,Memorex labels,Have not used them yet but product looks good. I plan on using them soon. Thanks for the product. I appreciate the price. Eric D.
5,It does the job,"The texture of this label is very nice. It makes for very nice, professional looking lables. The price is great!"
3,CD LABEL REFILLS WORKED OUT FIND,I wanted to do my own CDs and Labels so I did order this for my own online studio to make my own music just for me. Worked out fine! You all should try it because it was so easy and fun.Almarine The Redeemed
4,cdlabels,Your company was the only place I was able to find a good quantity of these CD labels that I had been using previously. They were at a very good price. I appreciate the ease in ordering and receiving my order.Thank you.
5,great buy,"This is a great buy. Buying labels in the store is quite costly, but purchasing them in this way is quite economical."
2,careful - cd labels are destructive,"I'm sure the labels are wonderful, but please be aware that they have a destructive impact on your cdr's. The glue, the ink from your printer perhaps, the labels not being perfectly centered - all cause problems. I've been labelling some of my cdrs for 10 years now, and the older labelled ones have become unplayable: just extreme noise/static on some or all of the tracks. I am in the process of copying those labelled ones which still work to a backup copy, and am even using special non-toxic sharpies for those guys (regular sharpies can impact your cdr's as well).I suggest doing your own research to verify, but I wish I had done that 10 years ago (though I'm not sure it was known then anyway).Never mind that certain systems (in cars, for example) warn you not to put labelled cd's in because of the additional thickness and potential for jams.Also be aware of how any heat can ruin those cdr's as well.I cannot vouch for labelling DVD-R's, but check it out."
3,"Good price, decent quality","The labels are of decent quality, but the software is completely useless. I had to make a Microsoft Visio template to print the labels."
1,Trouble using for full-face,"When trying to use a full-face design the center label pulls out causing a high reject rate, Poor design.Would like a full face no center."
2,good paper quality - worst company,"I really like quality of the paper and it's easy to apply it using Avery label applicator.. However, getting a print on this image is another world. Good luck finding their software on their website. I found ""ExPressIt"" by Memorex from 3rd party site, but zipped file was corrupted. So I had to use 3rd party software, (15 days trial licence) to be able to finish my project. Took me 2 hours to figure this out and finally print a label. Very frustrating."
5,PERFECT,"Of all the various systems on the market for the purpose of labeling CD's, DVD's, etc., the Memorex system is the best I've found. The matte finish labels are bright, white and take color beautifully."
3,WHY PUT OUT A POORER PRODUCT NOW?,"In about 2000, I made a series of beautiful CD labels using the Memorex CD Label program--Then, when my computer imploded, lost that program and had no way to even open the labels until I bought the current software.AND IT IS TERRIBLE-- Where previously the software was use-friendly, quick and allowed a lot of artistry, now it is a slow, primitive version of its former self.I just wonder--Why would Memorex shoot their own software in the foot like this? Are they just planning to phase it out entirely, but making it too difficult and time-consuming to even use?"
4,what I expected,"These labels print nicely and were exactly what I expected for the price. The software that comes with the package is good enough for printing labels, although they don't print exactly as you see them on the monitor (there will be white space on the label if you don't overlap it in the software. Other than that, this is a decent pack of matte labels and you can't beat the price."
3,Just not like it used to be,"I've bought these before and they were great. But the last batch was a little different. I don't know if they changed them or I received a cheap knock-off. When I print on the new ones, the colors just aren't as vibrant. And now when I apply the labels to discs, I almost always get air bubbles underneath. I can usually smooth them out, but it takes time and a lot of rubbing and pushing on the label. I'll still give it three stars since the price is good for what you get."
2,One time use.,"This product is a great price for what it is but if you are going to use one sheet more than once, this are not a good choice. If you have multiple lables to print at once it's probably worth it. But for everyday use making only a couple lables at a time you end up wasting half the labels because the printer can not grab the thin paper the labels are on and it just ends up jamming the printer."
3,CD Label Refills work fine,Received the items and they worked just as advertised. Will purchase more once I use these up.
5,Great buy!,I have tried several labels and prefer these above the others. They have better adhesive quality than my next favorite labels. Buy them and I believe you will prefer them too!
4,Mermorex CD/DVD Labels,"I've been using another brand for years, but these are the best and the software support is excellent."
1,Labels are worthless due to terrible software,"The supporting software for these labels is awful. To begin with, you can't even use it on a Mac. Who makes a multimedia product accessory that isn't Mac compatible? Also, since the labels aren't set up like other templates, you can't even download an existing template to create something without the terrible software.Second, if you are making multiple labels at once, there is no way to see and edit each label. You have to choose print preview, delete the label with the error, and then recreate it without the error.There are lots of other problems too, but my summary is this: Don't buy them."
4,Producer User,I have bought these labels before and I will buy them again. I have no problem printing my art work on them for CD's and DVD's I produce with most any desk top printer .
5,excellent product,"This an excellent product. Covers completely the DVD and adheres to it with ease. Other products do not last even if you press hard.And, of course, with Amazon, you get the product very fast.Will buy and recommend this product again/"
4,Favors for Fundraisers,The labels produced a wonderful favor for my church fundraiser on the Spirit of Philadelphia
5,GREAT LABELS,"I AM ON MY SECOND PACKAGE OF THESE CD LABELS AND SO FAR EVERYTHING IS GOING WITHOUT ANY HITCHES. THE LABELS PRINT WELL, AND HAVE EASY REMOVAL FROM THE SHEET TO THE CD WITH NO PROBLEM. THE STAMPER, WHICH YOU PURCHASE SEPARATELY, IS A MUST HAVE, TO GET PROPER LABEL ALIGNMENT TO THE CD."
5,Best CD/DVD labels ever!,"I have used other brands of labels; they never stuck to the surface or were poor printing quality. These are the first labels that I have never had one problems with. A big thank you to Memorex, I rate them a A+."
3,"Great price, good quality, but hard to use","This label are good quality, and you get a good amount for a low price.The only complain I have, is that if you use the inner center, %99 of the time won't come off from the label. You have to pretty much remove it yourself.Everything else works fine."
5,A good deal,"Even with shipping I was able to purchase 2 of these items for less the price of one packet at a local office supply store!Memorex White CD Labels, Matte Finish. 300 Count (32020403"
2,Buyer Beware,The tape which I received was out of sync. The audio was consistently 2 frames early throughout the entire performance. In some of the sections it was more than 20 frames out. I found it very distracting to view the tape as a performance or instuctional video. Also there was no detailed transcription provided. After some research I found it online. I agree with other reviewers that this not an instructional video. Anga was truely a great and talented musician and will be missed. His perfromance on this video is outstanding. I would have preferred to see him play in a group situation or play more folkloric pieces. I could not relate to him jamming with a dj or pianist. That being said I think this video produtcion falls short of being a performance video. In my opinion the video lacks continuity and seems to be thrown togeather. The only positive thing I have to say about the produtcion is the audio quality is good.
2,Amazing Playing - MuchToo Little Instruction,"Miguel ""Anga"" Diaz is considered one of the top conga drummers in the world. One viewing of this video will obviously show you why. His complete mastery of multiple drum set ups are astounding. Nevertheless, despite the well written transciption book by Victor Rendon, Anga only spends about 5 minutes with three excerises, in developing conga drum technique. There is no mention of developing proper tones/strokes. This is not an instructional video but a performance video."
1,Cosmic Pet Twisty Fur Squirrel,"In the picture displayed, it shows a plastic container FILLED with these squirrels and that is what I thought I was going to receive. When I opened the box, there was only ""one"" squirrel in a plastic bag. They should not be showing a picture of a full container of squirrels if there intent is to send only one squirrel to their customers. Looks like false advertisement to me. Also, my cat is not interested in the toy squirrel at all. He smelled it, and walked away. Huge waste of money!"
1,Cheap Trash,"I purchased this paperback edition when it was released in the 1980s, but I found that I already had most of the contents in other Mencken collections. But despite that the book had not seen much use, the pages soon began falling out, and the cover came off the binding. The quality of the paper is about that which is used for comic books. In about 1986, I wrote Vintage Books a sharply-worded letter vowing that's I'd never purchase another of their editions, and I haven't. (Neither should you.)So far, I haven't received a reply."
3,"some facts, but many omissions","A book which provides some general informations about the plan of G-d for the Jewish people but is misleading considering the faith and doctrines of the author, whom tends to separate the role of Israel from that of the Church, creating a vague link between Christians and the Jewish people which doesn't go much further than general solidarity. Yet, Christians are a PART of Israel, not simply HELPERS in the design of G-d for them."
4,Who Moved My Cheese?,"Who Moved My Cheese?By: Anthony CalabreseI read the book Who Moved My Cheese? The book is by Spencer Johnson. The story takes place a long time ago in a cheese maze. The story is about 2 little tiny people and 2 mice. The two people get their cheese stolen. One thinks if he yells its not fair that it will just come back on its own. The other one is right because he thinks if goes and explores, he will find new cheese. It turns out the cheese wasn't stolen but it ran out because they took advantage of their amount. Their plot is that they want to find their cheese so they wont starve. The theme in this story is no matter how much you moan, that the thing that went missing wont just turn up. You have to go and find more. Life Goes On!"
1,A very stupid Book,I read who moved my cheese one day and really didn't get anything out of it. I thought that it wasn't a helpful book at all. I also thought that even a kindergardener could read and understand it. I am a very avid reader and was very dissapointed with this book.
4,Puts into perspective what is really ours and what isn't,Excellent book to help us view the real world. What we thought was ours is really not ours forever. Change is constant and we must realize it. Very gentle way of helping us see it.
2,Not what I expected,These bundle of movie hits are renditions of the original songs.Some of them fall short of the acceptable target.
