4,One of the few dissertations available on Amazon.com,"During an interview with Halley Suitt in 2004, Bob Metcalfe reminisces that in May of 1972 when he defended this thesis, Harvard rejected it and he failed. He was depressed about it at the time but points out with some satisfaction that it's now one of the few PHD thesis' available on Amazon.com. You can hear the interview at http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail200.html. This discussion is at about the 9-minute mark."
1,Look elsewhere,"As with most tutorials, this one suffers miserably from being completely linear, and completely based on your working with their site, not yours. If you have a simple question about a simple operation in the software, it is just about impossible to find the information you need and get a simple answer. I find it worse that useless, it is infuriating."
1,"Ok for Beginners, Terrible for anyone else","... if you are just getting into computers, the web, webdesign or graphic design and are a complete and utter beginner, or youhave a hard time learning new software -- this book is for you. Its a very gentle start on the program and after wards you can create a web site. You can also learn to maek a basic web page for free on the web... and save the money. If you have had any experience with design software & windows and have made an attempt to read the manual than skip this book. it useless for anything but the bare basics. It should ahve been included as a quick start guide instead."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"I bought this book based upon the user responses before me. This book is perfect for the web designer who lives in the Ice Age and has never used an Adobe product before. The contents of this book are already known by most sixth graders. If you are a pre-sixth grader in modern times and think Adobe is ONLY a building material, this book is perfect for you!"
1,I am not happy!,"The cd rom contains several broken files, no explenations on how to find the sitewindow when lost, the second web page you are to create misses three essential buttons. I recomend the designers to make a new one."
1,adobe go live 4 calssroom in a book,Waste of money....anyone can do this book in a day. The book constantly keeps telling you to read chapters in the user manual for information.A lot of info not covered.This book is only good for the most basic site.I want my money back. P.s chapters in the book can be found on the adobe site.
4,I feel like and expert!,"I'm a beginning web designer and bought this book to avoid taking a $300 course at the local college. I feel like I have a good handle on the basics of a great program now. The more advanced stuff (like CSS) did confuse me toward the end, but I know I can always use the book as a reference. Great for beginners!"
3,Great for Beginners!,"Before I started using Adobe Go Live Classroom in a Book I had no knowledge at all about building a web site. I found the book very helpful since I was starting from a blank slate, but if you have any knowledge of web design at all I wouldn't recommend this book. It quite often refers to the users manual for more in depth description and the lessons often left me with a lot of unanswered questions. Overall, it proved to be very helpful for me though. I am confident that I could now build my own web site, though it would not be a very complex project! I would recommend this book as a starting point to anyone who would like to learn the basics, but plan on investing in a more advanced book later on to learn the more intricate details of the program."
2,skimpy,"very thin book, should be advertised as a phamplet. not a book, and overpriced to start. the thin book is just a copy of pages put together, for exploitation of willy morris's name. very cheap on the pictures ( one ) . and not worth the price. i was dissapointed in the volume of it's pages, should have been sold as a guide, for less than half the price."
5,"Great breaks, super great price",I bought front and rear for my wife's Honda because of the rating and a nice mail in rebate promo and then bought a set for my car. I am extremley satisfied with this purchase and the price paid
2,Not well made.,I found this toy to be cheaply made and frankly...junk. The rockets do not always shoot off and one of the plastic nozzles has already broken off. We thought all 4 rockets shot off at the same time but only one at a time shoots. You made to turn the top for the next rocket to shoot off and it is too hard for my 5 year old. You get what you pay for.
3,"Fun, but not completely smooth","This rocket launcher is not bad, you are meant to load 4 rockets on and shoot them one at a time by turning the barrel, but sometimes more than one goes, or one gets stuck due to a tight fit. They recommend corn flour for sticky rockets, but heck it is a toy, I just want it to work. Overall not bad for the money, a little hard for a smaller kid to really get a good launch on (maybe 6 and under)"
2,Rocket,"This toy is kind of fun for kids to see the rockets shoot up in the air, particularly in an open space. But on the first day that my son played with it inside the house, he dropped it on our tile floor and one of the launcher on the pump rocket broke off. We have not been able to fix it."
5,As advertised,"Just as advertised, the new mount works well with my Tom-Tom GO 510. No problem with install, everything worked as designed."
1,No Hands Free Calling,"If you are planning to use this for hands free calls via a Bluetooth phone connection, don't bother. Despite what the sales pitch or the manual says, you cannot here phone conversations through this mount. You can here the the phone ring on an incoming call, but once you answer the call, the audio switches to the internal speaker on my 910.I called TomTom tech support and was told that the statement about using this mount for Hands Free Calls in the features portion and in the manual was I quote ""Probably a misprint and they would look into it""."
3,"Worked well, but could be better","I know that maybe I wanted it to be more than it is, but I found this to have a little more 'noise' when running the transmitter over the radio. I am not expecting audiophile level output, but I could not seem to adjust the transmitter and radio to not have at least a little bit of a hum. However, I am basically satisfied with it. I am using it with a TomTom 910."
2,Disappointing so far,"I bought it to prevent having to put another cable (audio => car stereo) across the dashboard. I agree fully with the first reviewer that the quality is poor. As he, I haven't been able to find a frequency that was free of static and in the rare cases that I did, this didn't last long, presumably because a radio signal on that same frequency came within range as I drove along.I'm pretty critical when it comes to sound quality and this just doesn't cut it. As mentioned, it's not even FM quality, which is pretty much free of static these days.A disappointment so far."
2,Not that useful,"but it's not the fault of this product; it's the fault of the TomTom device. It's not very user friendly when it comes to managing music. You have to use MP3, which I don't normally do, and creating playlists is nearly impossible. I went through coverting loads of music, but the lack of playlists made the whole exercise pointless. Hopefully, TomTom will update the software, allowing for WMA to allow for better syncing with Windows Media Player. I don't use this device at all."
3,unstable tomtom windshield mounting,I would like to know from someone out there how to keep the device from drooping after it's installed on the windshield?
1,A TOTAL waste of money,"We traveled in a friends car that has on-board GPS. When a phone call came in the GPS over-powered the radio and he just started talking. This mount requires you be on a certain channel in order to hear it over your radio speakers, so you can forget being able to be listening to your favorite radio channel and simply receiving a call over your GPS. A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY...DO NOT BUY"
2,effective but not a very powerful FM transmitter,I used this product for a road trip from Boston to Dallas. It was very simple to set up. However I realized that the FM transmitter was not very powerful and that if you hit a pot hole hard enough the transmitter would shut off. Another thing related to the FM transmitter weakness was the fact that you had to turn the radio volume up fairly high to hear your ipod or the tom tom navigational voice directions playing through the FM transmitter. One thing i wish the system would allow is for you to charge your ipod through the fm transmitter. Espcially since the fm transmitter will connect to your ipod using the same port on your ipod to charge it. But it only connects it to both transmit the audio and control your ipod but it won't charge it.
1,Defective Item,I have returned two of these now. Both defective. This mount will not hold the weight of the GPS unit. It droops down if you mount this on your windshield until it hits your dashboard. I would not purchase this item until the design is changed.
3,TomTom FM Transmitter,"I bought this to replace the OEM Mount that came with my GO 510. The basic functions work -- sticks to windshield and charges the GPS, but other functions don't seem to work as well. The FM transmitter has so much static that I can barely here the GPS spoken directions. I haven't been able to use the speaker phone (connected by bluetooth to my mobile phone) either using the built-in microphone or external microphone since I got it. I don't know if I can attribute this to the mount or not, but these features used to work."
2,This was to be a birthday gift!!!,I am returning these DVD's. There was no plastic wrap around the DVD container and both of the DVD's are scratched. Not happy with this at all.
1,Struggling to finish this book,"I bought this book because my mother lives in the Alentejo. I intended to read it and then send it to her. But I'm struggling to even finish it. I'm a college graduate, and I've read plenty of complex novels, but this one leaves me feeling like I'm missing some skill necessary to decode it. I think I need an English Literature class in order to understand it, and frankly, I don't want to put that much work into reading for pleasure. There are too many characters, with too little to tie them together, and sentences thrown in at the end of paragraphs that leave me thinking ""huh?""Others clearly love this book, so I realize this is just a mismatch between reader and style of book. But I thought I should write a review so that others who want plenty of accessible plot in a book know to look elsewhere."
3,Curiously Unexciting,"I found this book not up to par with ""Brick Lane"" and couldn't get into it. There are so many other books worth reading."
1,Does Amazon CARE?,"Does Amazon Care? Amazon attitude is Buyer Beware. They are only interested in selling any product that generates income, your negative responses don't matter except to potential customers who take the time out to read them. Amazon should be more proactive and investigate the negative reviews. Offer better alternatives."
1,bull shit,"i found a laptop for a cheaper price. cancelled the laptop and some how got stuck with only a damn 3-year service plan. my parents tryed cancelling it for me, because i am in the military and i got deployed. i had no means of doing it my self. but they told her she was giving the wrong information. so if any one would like to help me i am back home awaiting a email response so i can get my money back for this service plan and NO notebook to go with it.THANKS[...]"
5,Threesome,I loved this book and couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read more of Brenda L Thomas books.
3,Pretty Boring,"This was not a page turner for me. It took me about a month to finally finish. The content was not too bad, it started off being interesting, then dwindled down to me."
3,SMUTIN IT UP,ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS SHE WAS A WILD ONE SLEEPING AROUND WITH DIFFERENT MEN LIKE THAT. HOW OLD WAS SHE?
2,I Wish There Were Something Better,"This book is the only game in town for Latin SAT II Prep, and as such, it is serviceable. You should know, however, that it will not help you figure out why your answers were incorrect, nor how to improve your scores except by trial and error. Although the book contains many mock tests, most of them are so old that they don't match the material currently tested. Finally, my class and I found a few errors in the questions. So caveat emptor!"
4,Good for final preparation,"The book has neither a grammar guide nor a comprehensive vocabulary section. However, it is filled to the brim with test questions which will prove very helpful to well-prepared students. But since study guides for SAT II Latin are very hard to come by this book is a must."
2,"Nice complimentary information, bad general material","At first I enjoyed studying for the SAT Latin Subject Test with this book. However, after breezing through the questions and going in to take the actual test, I found that a lot of the extra information in the book (upwards of 50 pages) was unusable in the actual test. I did also notice some errors in the book as others stated in their reviews.I did score a 680, but I was hoping for much higher and will be taking it again sometime during this school year. I have chosen not to use this book as one of my study materials for the coming test."
4,This is a good tool for reviewing for your SAT II Latin test,"This is a concise and complete review guide that i would suggest for anyone planning to take the SAT II: Latin. It will help you master anything you never understood, and it will help you touch up your rougher areas with its Q and A!"
2,Abridgement is awful and undermines the story.,"I loved this book because it made a familiar story new and exciting. However, the abridgement on the audio version destroyed continuity and trivialized much of it. Two examples: (1) Ivan is circling the chasm avoiding the bear. The details of him getting across the chasm are edited out, so we're left wondering how. (2) Ivan finds a message in Kiev which later proves instrumental in a climactic scene -- all mention of the note is left out until suddenly, it appears when needed with no explantion. It's as if the editor simply excised parts regardless of content and made no effort to patch the holes in the plot. This is an example of a 5-star book turning into a 2-star audio book."
2,How did they manage to mangle such a good story?,"Who chose the reader of this book? And who did the abridgment? I'm still listening to the tape, but in spite of the terrible reading and only because the story -- in spite of the unexplained cuts and breaks -- itself is so good. If the tape hadn't been given to me as a gift, I would be really peeved right now at having spent money for it. I'm going to buy the book, though, because I want to get the whole story. When I read the book, I'm sure I'll be able to give it a much better review than this review of the tape."
5,the best game ever,if you like adventure one player mode or 2 player mode this is the game for you. you can make bazokas ozis shotguns tanks. all sort of stuff i am telling you you should definetly consider buying this game. it may look chep but you are getting more then you paied for. it is a really good game.
1,seriously?,"I thought this was an incredibly amazing game with an amazing multiplayer system that everyone will enjoy, but 350 dollars? really?"
5,One game to rule them all.,This game is absolutely brilliant. In essence the game is truly well thought. timeless fun with a streak of weirdness. I can only say this was one of very few games which had my friends wanting more.
4,timer review,The first one I installed was defective and caused me lots of problems until I determined that it was defective. Then I replaced it with another it it works just fine. The small access door does obstructs the view and makes it hard to program but otherwise the product is fine.
5,Great Product,Just installed 3 timers. Easy to install and simple to operate. Color is slightly off from the standard almond face plate. I would highly recommend this product over any of the timers from the big box stores.
2,Only works for 4 months....,"I bought this item on June 2010 from amazon.comIt was Easy to install and program, just follow the instruction.Everything seems ok, except that it's completely dead now, after works for only 4 months..."
4,Good read - good info on hacker defense,"The book is a good read and has many interesting examples of hacker attacks and tools. I'm an MCSE and a webserver administrator so I felt compelled to try all these hacking techniques on my servers and colleagues servers. The actual hacking techniques are over simplified and generally do not offer a casual hacker (non leet hacker) any opportunity to compromise you system. Only a way to impress their friends by saying - look I can tell what ports are open on this machine or look I can tell what operating system they are running etc. The explainations of defenses from these hacker probes and attacks I thought were very useful. The defenses are clear and relatively easy to implement. If you are paranoid - or take substantial pride in keeping hackers out of your system - definitley read this book. If you are generally interested in network WAN security, read this book."
4,a not bad reference book for computer security auditor,"Do not expect too much form the book if you wanna to be a hacker, however, if you are trying build a basis understanding about how your I.S should be audited. The book is worth of reading."
3,the book is good but its not good enough,the book-as i said befor in the summary- is good but its not good enough.....its not written for a certain class of readers......its not high enough for the experts and its ont simple enough for the beginners
1,Exposing Hacking Exposed,"When consider a title, the audienced and projected population should be considered. This book fails both.I read a lot of computer books, since I work on networks and I wouldn't want to do anything else for a living. I hope the authors have something other to do than writing, since they do it so very poorly. The book is badly titled and terribly written. After an hour's struggle I set it aside. It rambles and presents topics such that retention is all but impossible. Simply put, Hacking Exposed has nothing to do with hacking, cracking and everything to do with the boring diatribes of those big on theorectical security and lean on practice. Deep discounts are definately in order."
3,"Been There, Done That.",I didn't find anything in this book that I hadn't found after doing a few days worth of research on the web. Many parts of the text seem to have been directly lifted from the Read Me files of the tools that the author is trying to describe. A real cut-n-paste job.
4,End Hacking with this book,"The nice thing about this book is the way that it makes you think more and more about security issues , also the The actual hacking techniques is a nice thing to try on your servers and helps you to achieve a better hacking proof network and servers."
2,Hacking Reviewed,"Boring! What else is there to say about hacking, it isn't like the movies, and this book taught me that.... but i didn't learn that much"
2,"Nothing new, try the L0pht","I bought the book yesterday and promptly returned it today. The reason is very simple, what is covered in the book can be found repeatedly on security sites and hacker sites. Also, I found the lack of explainations on exactly why each hack works is very disturbing. If you want to protect your system it's best to understand the ENTIRE sitituation before trying to solve the problem using shortcut methods described in the book. Rather, read the full documentation of each hack and understand what exactly it is your dealing with. This way not only will you fix the holes now but will be prepared from any future hacker attempts."
4,Good reference book,"You are currently looking for a reference book on how people can access your computer? You are currently managing a project which requires real-life example of computer break-in? You just are looking for all possible security break-in in one book.If you answered yes to any of those, read this book. You will find some (or maybe many) suprises on how it is both easy to break-in and to secure your computer.The best thing for this book is the fact that all trouble has a solution and all of it is written there."
2,A Hacker Guide?,"This book is a nice read if you are interested in security. Under no circumstances should this book be used as a hacker ""guide."" People think that just because a book is titled ""Hacking Exposed"" it will be an in-depth guide on how to use techniques to infiltrate systems. This book is nothing more than a primer on security and scratches the surface of how attacks on networks are accomplished, not a step-by-step guide on how to complete those attacks. Don't judge a book by it's cover, especially this one."
2,Bloated...with little substance,"This book is really nothing more than a guide. If you don't have time to search the internet (and the stuff is not hard to find) then this book may be of some help. It's amazing how they managed to fill up so many pages and tell you very little. They tell you about all of the tools and where to get them, but they give you nothing on how to use them, with the exception of nmap and ncat. If you can get this book used for a few bucks, then it may be a good buy as a reference, but don't buy it at the retail price."
4,Appended review,I forgot to say that the references in the back are excellent and I still use many of the sites as a reference when testing my servers for intrusion.
3,Expsoure is a good thing.,"An excellent book for the complete novice. Covers basic concepts and methods in a professional manner that is easy to follow as well as being informative. The only downside to the book is how outdated it becomes in a short amount of time, don't be tricked into thinking that this book will get you into a machine just by following the instructions. The authors are very system administrator friendly and explains the vulnerabilities as well as the ways to patch your system against them."
3,Reads like a Microsoft ad,"There is some really good content here. I especially liked the information on reconnaissance and enumeration. The authors are obviously *very* biased towards Microsoft products however and spend a lot of time trying to convince the reader that they make the most secure operating systems on the planet. While some Windows exploits are covered, their impact receives a good dose of marketing spin."
3,good but some what easy,This game is good if you are looking for fun and easy game. But if you are an expect at playstation this game might be to easy
1,Dissapointed,"I paid about $20.00 more for the surestep bumper than the diamond plate that I was going to order, because the web site said it had a 1"" hitch hole and 8,000 pound capacity. I wasted my money. The hole is 3/4"" not 1"" and the capacity is 3,500 not 8,000.On the good side it came quickly and fit perfectly."
5,"A very imaginative account, with an incomparable orchestra","I am usually not a great fan of Thielemann's soft-grained condcuting, but he scores a triumph here. Strauss's Alpine Sym. has traveled the long road from sneered-at hokum to a genuine orchestral blockbuster taken up by every virtuoso orchestra. To earn its keep, most conductors ignore musical values in favor of raw showmanship. but not Thielemann, who wants us to hear every bar as sincere nature poetry, just as we listen to Beethoven's Pastorale. It worked for me -- I actually felt something subtler than the wow factor. By reining in the bombastic rhetoric, he has done something quite special, and the Vienna Phil. continues to astound. I am especially grateful to DG's engineers for capturing the actual flavor of the VPO -- this CD is about as close to the real thing as I've ever experienced."
1,Very unsatisfactory,"I purchased this bed to use when I moved into an apt...bed bug prevention. It sagged in the middle from the start, and the motor just whined and smelled like burned rubber when I tried to fill it to make it level. Within 6 months the seams have all blown out so it looks like a big round ball and barely fits in the bedroom now. Major back pain has ensued. Steer clear of this one!"
1,"Damaged item arrived, but no money back - avoid this purchase!","I purchased this item, but when I wanted to use it for the first time, I found it already had a hole in the brand new bed, hence, was useless. After contacting the seller, and then speaking to the company, I could not get any refund nor replacement. Basically, I lost a lot of money for having a non-functional item. The seller was not helpful at all, hence, I would definitely stay away from buying this item!!Finally, I would avoid this kind of matress and also this seller.Best,MJK"
3,trying to return,I needed to Return my un-opened beds and no one has come back to me after numerous e-mails and calls. very very unprofessional on their part.
1,Waste of MONEY!!!,I bought this for my brother who LOVES computer games!!! EVERY game it came with was only a trial for an HOUR then you had to BUY the game separately!!! What a JOKE. Buyer beware!
5,Reads like Morrisey's songs feel,"I loved this book. Like Morrisey's carefully crafted songs, the books expands the low key events in a small New England mill town until they feel as important to the reader as they are to the characters. Those looking for high adventure or unlikely plot twists should look elsewhere; This book is for those who love a simple tale-well-told. I can't wait until he tosses his hat in again with another book."
2,"Bill, don't give up your gigs!","After seeing Bill Morrissey perform at a small club in New York, I couldn't wait to read his novel. What a time waster! Flat, one-dimensional characters with little to say in a town where nothing much happens. If there's a story line here, I missed it! Dialogue is inane, with an over-abundance of women who sigh, ""Oh, Henry...,"" at the protagonist."
4,Lyrical short stories,"A Place Between Stations is filled with beautiful short stories. Allen's prose is sparse, but she is able to create evocotive word pictures, and I am able to see every situation clearly in my head. She is able to tell a story with the right amount of detail- we don't get bogged down trivia.The stories deal with African American women of varying ages and social situation. They center around a situation that will color the women's attitude forever. My favorite was about a young girl who discovered the body of a homeless woman along the side of an abandoned railroad yard. The girls confusion about the how's and why's of the world, were both beautiful and sad. But whether the stoy was about a 9 year old girl, or an older widow, all the heroine's were searching for some sort of lost innocence."
4,Great multipurpose system,"I have been very happy with our infant travel system from Baby Trend. I love the swivel wheel in the front for more manuverability and security and the durable wheels make our daily jaunts on the bike trail a snap.It is true the system does not allow the car seat to lay back as well for newborns as I would like, but I figured a way around that. I shift the car seat more forward so it does not come below the red safety tabs and it lays back better. It would not be a good idea to do this if you plan to run with it, however.We get more positive comments on the travel system from strangers and friends alike and I have yet to find a baby jogger that has an infant car seat insert with such high ratings for car safety as Baby Trend."
5,One of the BEST jogger strollers!,"This is one of the best strollers, I have used or tried out! It is so easy to use. Pop out and fold up are a cinch! My baby does not wake up after he has fallen to sleep due to the smooth ride! :-) I also love the long strap attached. You can use it for a child or pet to keep them close!The only disadvantage is if you have a small car, it is difficult to get it in the car or trunk. AND... I get a lot of compliments on the stroller!"
2,be careful with front tire!!!!!,"I liked the idea of the swivel wheel so it can double as a stroller. The quick release is not a good idea. If you buy this stroller be VERY CAREFUL TO TIGHTEN FRONT WHEEL TIGHTER THAN YOU THINK. I believe I had, and the wheel came off one side of the fork, twisted sideways and acted like an instant brake and sent me and the stroller tumbling to the pavement. The top-heavy design makes this easy to happen. Not a great design."
3,cheaper elsewhere,this is a awesome stroller carrier set BUT its cheaper at wal-mart!!!! its the exact same stroller and baby carrier
2,Frustrating...,"We so looked forward to using our jogging stroller, and when it came in the mail, I assembled it per the instructions. When we used it, the front wheel shook so badly. This was frustrating because I wanted the pivotal wheel to be able to use this stroller while walking, shopping, AND have the option to lock it for jogging. At first I thought maybe our baby just didn't weigh enough to keep the front down, but over time I found that wasn't the case. The front shaky wheel was reason enough for me to get online and write a review about this stroller. So disappointing!"
2,Not really impressed,"ALthough the concept is a great idea, I feel this product was poorly manufactured. The first one I purchased was missing several parts and we returned to the store for exchange(after lugging the stroller- which doesn't fit in either of our cars- saab and Toyota sedans w/o removing the wheels). The second one is also missing screws to secure the foot board. Although minor, it attests to the poor attention to detail that in the process' of this stroller.Secondly, when going even slight faster than a moderate walk (>3.5 mph) the stoller shakes if the front wheel is not locked. Often time the hand trigger does not work- so you are forced to stop your walk (or jog/run) to fix this.While the concept is nice, still has a little way to go. I would try other models even if more expensive first--"
1,Connolly Leather Care Cleaner,"The product was not able to eliminate a combination of cat shedings and cloth residue. The deliviery was excellent, but I do not believe the product works, expecially at this price. I would like some recommendations or a refund."
5,A soon to be classic,"This is by far one of the best games that Fifa and EA Sports have created! The graphics are great, and the gameplay is smooth. The only problems i have with the game is the intro song by Chumba Wumba, and the poor commentary by those two annoying Brits!! I'm also pleased that you're able to choose from all of the countries participating in the World Cup, even the ones that haven't made it in a while (like Ecuador, which might i add just made it for the first time this year!!!). All in all, this game is great for anyone who loves soccer!!"
2,Not As Expected!,"A fan of the previous two books in this series I was extremely unhappy with this one.The hero was totally unlikable. I could not find any redeeming qualities in him whatsoever. He spend the whole book finding fault with the heroine, complaining, belittling, you name it. He supposedly ""bonded"" with her but was able to sleep with a different woman every night. The last couple pages of the book where he decides that he ""loves"" her are supposed to redeem him and give it a happy ending."
2,Disappointing,"Instead of being called ""I Hunger for You,"" it probably should have been called ""I Hunger to Get the Heck Away from You."" It annoyed me that for most of the book Colin was trying to avoid being ""stuck"" with Mia, and whining about how having a vampire woman for a mate would be so much better."
2,Disappointing read,"With apologies to Ms. Sizemore---this book ""sucked"". I was so disasppointed in it. I loved the first two and waited, it seemed like forever, for this one to come out. (I was actually at the bookstore watching it be unpacked.--Silly me.) The plot line was weak--although how she got the Patron involved this time was fairly clever--but predictable, and the secondary character of Laurent has GOOD possibilities (book 4 I think)The hero, Colin Foxe, a Clan Prime vampire, acted like a spoiled, little boy and was so caught up in ""having to bond with a female vampire"" that his thoughts on the subject got incredibly boring and old. (God forbid that his bondmate might be mortal) The heroine, Caramia Luchese, a ""wannabe"" slayer/hunter, had some very good points, but dwelled way to much on the ""woe is me--I'm bonded to a vampire"". The book was way to short (BIG print) and no sex to speak of. All in all-- a BIG disapointment."
2,I Hunger for You,"The book started out pretty well, but the characters and the dialog wasn't that believable. I was left a little unsatified with the book. It could have been better."
2,It could be better,I waited for this book to come out and I had to make myself finish the book. It does not give the history of their getting together. The preview of the book is more exciting the whole story line. I was very disappointed in this book. It did not live up to the other two books in this series.
3,What happened?!?!?!?,The first two books in this series were wonderful. This one seemed like it wasn't even written by the same author. Was this actually her first book? Very unpolished. I found myself skipping just to finish it. Disappointing. I hope the next one is better.
2,Don't get your hopes up...,"I'm sorry, but I couldn't even finish this book. What a disappointment, because I was sooo looking forward to reading it. I absoltely loved her previous vampire novel, I Thirst for You -- I thought that book was outstanding. This book, however... well, I quit reading it about 75% the way through. Both the hero and heroine acted and sounded like 12 year olds. It's hard for me to believe the same author wrote this book and ""I Thirst for You,"" which was such a gritty, sophisticated vampire romance."
4,Another good Australian Centenary History,This a well written book covering the Royal Australian Air Forcefrom its origins as the Australian Flying Corps in World War 1 to2001. The author expresses forthright opinions on politicians andon senior RAAF officers.As regards World War 2 he emphasises the significant contributionmade by Australian aircrew to the allied bomber offensive againstGermany and stresses the very high casuality rate.He discusses the main aircraft types used by the force.There are good photographs of significant players and aircraft.All in all a most interesting book
3,size problem,"the shoes fit smaller than the other nursemate styles of the same size label, which i actually fit, at the store. i can only wear stockings/fine trouser socks with it. the rest of the quality is fine."
1,Did not help with mosquito bites,"For whatever reason, the only place where mosquito bites really bother me are my ankles, and of course the mosquitoes go for them any chance they get. I have tried various home remedies and one or two other creams, but so far nothing helps to relieve the itching. I bought this after reading reviews which said it was great for mosquito bites. Unfortunately, it did not help me at all. I got a little relief when applying the scrub, but right after I stopped scrubbing the itch would come back, only I could not scratch it because the scrub was there. I even contacted the manufacturer to be sure it wasn't expired, which they said this does not expire. Maybe its my skin, but this did nothing aside from make a mess and I simply cannot recommend it. The only thing that works for my ankles is my prevention technique of socks and boots."
3,An average game,"A typical combat game with a twist of immortality. Battle Monsters is a game of fate and twist between three tribes, the good, neutral and evil group. A good mix of replay, sounds, scheme, and other factors, this game is absolutely incredible! But still has its weak points..."
3,Five songs are under 3 minutes long,"Just so that you know, there's a lot of real short groove and.or ambient stuff on here - stuff that I just delete before putting it on my MP3 player. Good album - not great, but very good. It doesn't hit me that hard though - certainly not a five star album. I'm a big fan of JR and have almost all of his albums. Let me just say this - if you liked ""Elastic"", you'll like this one - no question. I liked Elastic and I like this album but, for me, neither are 5 star albums. I reserve 5 star for true masterpieces and these aren't exactly that but they're both very good"
1,Really Bad,"I always considered Redman a good sax player. I saw him last year and he put on a decent show. He's definitely not in the same league as his father, Dewey Redman. However, this is one of the worst albums I have in my significant collection. The only strong point is the drumming by Brian Blades. This is particularly true if you dig the funk style. Stay away from this nonsense. And please, don't call it jazz."
1,Lost his jazz soul.,"In the early 1990s, when he first gained acclaim, Joshua Redman was one of the bright hopes of jazz. He played with a fresh energy and fire, yet maintained touch with the jazz tradition in a way that all music fans could appreciate. In the last five years, however, he seems to have lost his moorings, and this latest overhyped album is merely another sad example of his musical drifting -- and our loss. I'm astonished by the rave reviews other reviewers here and elsewhere have given Redman's latest. This record is little more than rehashed funk, with a saxophone overlay that is miles short of the ability and inventiveness Redman displayed when he was playing so-called ""old-fashioned"" acoustic jazz. The tunes are nothing special, the thumping electronic rhythmic accompaniment is boring and heavy-handed, and Redman seems to have nothing interesting to say. Here's one (former) fan who hopes Redman will find his way back, if not to mainstream jazz, at least to credibility."
2,Just ok,"Joshua,s cd was just so so. I would not recomend this cd needs better arrangements & better material."
2,Boring!,"This book was a real sleeper. I've read lots of books on the subject, but just couldn't get into this one."
4,Good choice,"What's not to like? Beautiful music, beautifully played. There was one piece I was unfamiliar with, but I am now!"
1,Don't waste your time or money,Nothing but examples of applets no one over twelve years old would find fun or beneficial. For a business reference book...a zero.
3,Surprise...,"I thought I was ordering Ambulance since that's what the product name is, but I just received the fire engine instead. It does look pretty durable and nice. Now, where and how can I get the ambulance in the picture?"
4,RaT-a-tAt-TaT,"From the 20's to the 90's this book introduces you to the worlds greatest drummers and gives diagrams of their set-ups.The only thing I didn't like about the book is that it needs updating, with a few more drummers added. I am not a drummer but love listening to drum solo's, and bought this book out of curiosity.On the side... I downloaded 100+ drum solos from audiogalaxy, and winmx."
5,Great earring my daughter can wear.,"My daughter has had allergic reactions to every type of earring out there. We have tried 18 K gold, sterling silver, stainless steel, nickle free. No matter what, her ears would become red and infected within days. She has had these in for 1 month with NO PROBLEMS!Thank you for allowing her to wear earrings again."
5,Awesome Earrings on Amazon,My granddaughter is allegic to all metals and could not wearany jewelry. These earrings are plastic and look expensive.She loves them. What a find! Thank you for making theseavailable on Amazon.
4,ClearTouch - Nearly Perfect,I've been using the product with my Verizon XV6700 for ~15 months and I finally managed in my clumsy manner to put enough small scratched on the surface of the protector that I feel the need to change it.One fairly minor problem it's had since I first purchaed the triple pack of protectors is that for my XV6700 there is a small gap (between 1/32nd and 16th of an inch) above the top of the protector and the edge of the real screen.The second problem I only noticed upon trying to remove the scratched protector. It doesn't want to come off and there are no instructions for safe removal.
2,ok game,It's an ok game. You play in the middle of space with no bounderies that i've found yet. So that it's not that fun you can barely hit any of the targets.
1,Assumes thorough knowledge of Unix - Also poor reference,"I had purchased this book from Amazon hoping for a good reference, but they use many Unix terms that are not defined. Even Perl terms are poorly referenced- not very good if you are struggling to learn Perl on your own. I thought I would be able to find the information somewhere on a CD that is supposed to contain 6 books, but I was very disappointed and ended up using other reference books that weren't nearly as expensive."
5,The only perl reference purchase necessary!,"I can't think of a better reference for Perl than this searchable wonderful collection of 6 books. Beginners, intermediate, and advanced users can greatly benefit from this purchase alone. If you prefer hard copies when researching a problem, you can print out sections too, so don't discount this just because it's in electronic format. This package just makes it easier to find what you want to have for hard copy."
1,A protest,"This short book is overlong for the contest and dull, dull, dull. It is not a book about autism but the author's protest against being labeled insane. I think the writer goes on to prove that he is actually as delusional as he says he's not. Right, and I'm the Pope. This is a boring monograph. Don't waste your time and money."
4,Big Tim Skeleton,"It's helpful for studying,however, I require a little more detail in the articulations. That being said, this is a nice compromise between size and detail because it is easy to have in your study area as opposed to a larger skeleton."
3,Its okay for what it is,"If you are a visual person, meaning to learn you have to see then this is fine."
3,aesthetic only,It is asthetically only!. Upon hands on examination the lumbar went out of place 2 weeks after I got it. It was made in China. So that shows you the quality but it's ok for the price. Also comes with a pamplet that is a little hard to figure (half of it is in Chinese) out but you can understand it when reading in conjunction with your own textbook. Also it is written on with some type pen-paint? that rubs off easily if your hands are moist. Pretty much be careful when handeling it! the color you see on the skeleton is some kind of paint. :) I LOOOVVVED that it was easy to assemble!!! man it was a sinch! pop it in the pole and it's erect!
1,Missing piece,"When we received this product the key card was missing. Amazon could not send us one and advised we had to get it through the supplier. The supplier advised we had to get it through Amazon. When we went back to Amazon, they advised they no longer sell this product so we were out of luck. Will definately not buy from Amazon if BigFly Sports is the supplier."
3,"I love it, but it came late..","I love this skeleton, but it came late, but I can use it after the test I have this week in my anatomy and physiology class (10/8/09) on the skeleton system for when we go into where muscles and such attach at. I would recommend getting a skull in addition to this skeleton model, for though the body over all is amazing the skull is not quite big enough for you to study from. The bones in the hands and feet are kinda mushed together but you can discern enough that I do not think you need to get another model to see all the bones, the color markers help out alot."
3,"Basic learning model, not anatomically accurate","If you are a basic undergraduate level student, this is a good start. However, being a graduate level physio student, my model had a lot of glaring anatomical defects that drove me nuts. The ribs are not sized properly, the shoulders don't articulate into the GH joint, the elbow doesn't move very well which is fine given the price. The hip was misaligned, which is okay, maybe Tim had SCFE as a kid, who knows? Now, having bones put on the wrong way, the base doesn't fit into the frame,it's time for Tim to go back to the manufacturer. Too bad, the anatomical painting was a big plus for this model given similar models in this price range. My recommendation if you want something more anatomically accurate and precise, you will need to spend a little more money."
2,Nice but to small,The product is little and skinny so it is very hard to see everything and determine what is where. Very hard to find numbers on the bones and muscles.
1,Horrible,"The right clavicle was broken. I can see the cheap glue used to glue the clavicle to the sternum for both the medial ends. No directions on how to assemble. Still have no clue how to assemble the legs. Please email me and help me assemble. Key was crumbled in box, and the numbers on the skeleton are hard to distinguish and some are faded and not colored thoroughly."
1,Big Disappointment,"Based on other reviews, I purchased this to use as a study tool for my biology class. There were not any assembly instructions. It was poorly made. The numbers are hard to see on the skeleton. Big Tim is getting sent back."
3,Skeleton,"It took longer than I expected to come. They did not send the stand with it. I called them, they said they would send it and I still have not received it."
3,Size,"Prior to me writing this, the size of this skeleton didn't seem to be given anywhere on this page.I just looked up the details on the manufacturer's webpage. This model is 25.5 in = 0.6477 metres tall."
1,A&P anatomy,I guess the way people rate this skeleton is based on what they are using it for. I bought this skeleton to use for my bone test in anatomy for which it was pretty much useless. For anatomy we have to memorize a lot of the detail on the bones which this really doesnt have any. I thought the bones came all loose and I had to put them together which they don't. I would say this is helpful for a child or someone who just wants to learn the very general bones of anatomy. But for someone taking a college level course its basically a waste of money.
2,Medical School Anatomy,"I bought this product because I wanted to be able to see bones and muscle attachments in 3D as a study aid for my medical school gross anatomy course. Although this product will be helpful for muscle attachment, it is too small to study the bones properly. The hands and feet do not have individual bones and the rest of the skeleton is fairly small in size. In addition the skull is small and not very detailed. I would recommend something larger and more detailed for a medical school course."
2,SIZE DOES MATTER!!!!!!,"VERY SMALL, HARD TO READ LABELS, NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND I SHOULD HAVE LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS I READ! PROBABLY THE SIZE OF YOUR WRIST TO BICEP."
2,painted and numbered Big Tim,"I bought this product for my Anatomy and Physiology class. I did not like it because it was too small and the bones were not defined enough. I wanted to study the skeletal system so I thought purchasing this model would help me, it did not. I sent it back the same day it came. If you are trying to study the bones or even the muscles of the body, this product is not the one to buy. I was not happy at all."
5,I love this pedal,I used the original MXR flanger from the late 70's thru the 80's and loved it. I ended up trading it for another pedal and didn't use a flanger for a while. I recently built up my pedal board and purchased the reissue. This pedal is great. This is how flanger should sound. It has been my experience that MXR (Dunlop) pedals sound really good and work every time.
2,Does not Fit HP Deskjet Printers,"These are good cables no doubt, however it doesn't fit my HP Deskjet printer. The printer end of the cable is way different!"
3,Kinda Dissapointing,"I thought about giving this book 2 stars, but decided on 3. It isn't a bad book, which 2 stars would indicate.There are key parts of this book where it is very vague when defining or explaining things. I guess I was spoiled by Linux the Textbook (Or Unix the Textbook) by Syed Mansoor Sarwar, Robert Koretsky, and Syed Aqeel Sarwar.I feel like if Soyinka would have chopped out some of the sections and focused on some more depth, this has the potential to be a 5 star book.Perhaps I'm just wanting my book to be too comprehensive...I donno.I'm currently about half way through and do plan on finishing the book though, as I said, it isn't a bad book."
3,Good book except the Kindle formatting,Have really learned quite a few things from this book. When I got to approximately 72% of it the formatting on the Kindle shifted the entire page to the right. Would be nice if they fixed it and sent a new copy out.
1,Kindle edition is worthless,"The kindle edition of this book is worthless, some of the numbered steps have part of the number cut off(on my Kindle Fire all of it is cut off in somecases) in addition the lack of page numbers that corresponding to the print edition is worthless in my case as the instructor often refers to just ""do the numbered steps on page XX"""
2,Informative But Misleading,"ThIS BOOK IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS. THE TITLE IS VERY MISLEADING, but good for marketing purposes. I didn't realize until after my purchase that it is for those already familiar with Microsoft Windows Servers at a ""Power Users"" level or better. While I do believe it is a good book, the author should change the title. If you are not at least a ""Power User"" of Microsoft Windows Servers, spend your money on a book that would more effectively INTRODUCE you to Linux Administration. Thank God, I'm an advanced/power user!"
4,Good but...,"This is quite a good book. It has some humor, lots of examples (thoughhe rarely shows the output to his examples), and is quite detailed on many topics. However, the book is also deficient in some areas. For example, it never mentions telnet to log in. It mentions telnet to log into a POP server and how to compile SSH, but never anything directly about telnet. He mostly assumes that you know the basic basics (which is probably a good thing since if there is too much basics then everything else can get lost.)Still, after reading this book, I know enough to do my new job as a linux system administratior. <grin>"
4,Linux administration made EASY,"Steve did a wonderful job with this book. He answers nearly all the important questions you have before finishing the book. It has a really good section on firewalls in Linux as well as compiling your own kernel. The section on DNS was really quite nice. I always had a difficult time understanding DNS in Linux until reading this book and have successfully set up DNS on a Linux Server. The CD in the book didn't work, but that's OK...Linux can be downloaded for free...If you've been afraid to really get your hands dirty setting up a Linux server, you've run out of excuses. Steve Shah's book will get you through it."
5,Nice! Exactly what I need.,"After installingFedora 14 Linux, 4-disks DVD Installation and Reference Set, Ed.2011and going over some basics, I decided to look under the hood of Linux. I'm still a beginner, but may I say a ""curious beginner"". My colleague who is experienced Linux guy, and who is my Linux mentor, first suggested thisUNIX and Linux System Administration Handbook (4th Edition)but it is clearly for much more advanced users and it was too technical for me. I came across this book, and found it to be exactly what I need: an administrator' guide for a beginner. If you are a beginner and perform some administrator tasks, this book is a good guide. Recommended!"
2,Nick Wells lacking a great deal,"Why should I or anyone else spend more than thirty bucks for ""Special Edition using KDE"" when nearly everything in it can be found online or in help files? Another work, ""Practical KDE"" (also from Que) is absolutely full of relevant information obviously gained by first-hand experience (which I strongly suspect Wells is lacking) and also costs considerably less. I'm really sorry I wasted my money on Wells. Never again..."
3,A young artist with great promise ...,"I could go on, but J.S.M. pretty much articulated my reaction to this recording more brilliantly than I would have managed. Ms. de la Salle exhibits flashes of inspiration and brilliance; her tone is mostly lovely, her technique is impressive. But her quirky Chopinesque Mozart, though seductive in places, was hard for me to swallow. Further, I found her Prokofiev toccata to be a bit mechanical and heavy-handed - I prefer the fleeter treatments by Argerich and by Francois."
3,Nice bed time reading,"This book is based on interviews with economists and sociologist, who have tried to bridge the traditional gap between economics and sociology. Gary Becker, James Coleman, Mark Granovetter, Mancur Olson, Albert Hirschman, Jon Elster, Amartya Sen, among others, are among the interviewees. The reader will not find any remarkable insights in this book, but the interviews are generally quite nice to read. The book makes nice bedtime reading, but not much more."
5,Aslan Would Be Proud,The whole picture about any literary work helps us understand it better. This Companion fills that role excellently. I wish I'd had it years ago.
5,Very interesting,I love historical fiction and always wondered what those Atlantic crossings were like for myancestors who came to America during the mid to late 1800s. The book was very detailedand that was okay with me because that is just the information I had been seeking.
5,:),"Just ordered it! Haven't read it yet of course, but my own name is Jadwiga...which IS NOT a common name."
3,oi vei! too bad they are nazis!,"Indeed, i loved their music from moment one, its so black, so devilish, so mischivious. This album came together nicely. The thing is this guys are nazis and think none outside of their rubbish country is ready or even deserves a live concert, hey, they said it in an interview, not me. So, yea, this guys are pricks, they make good music, so its a give and take situation, oh well, they get 3 stars from me, sorry, nazis can't get more than 3 stars....."
4,one of the best games for any CD running game system.,this is a great game all except some of the ideas for the enemies were worse than any doom game i've ever played(i think the doom games are the worst imitation of any action\adventure game ever.)
4,100 Points and you made it!,"The book really uses 100 points to help you jumpstart into beginner's pastel painting. It's a handy book that allows you to carry around to read just to buy time while waiting for somebody or travelling on the subway. Good convenient size to carry around. Minimal text but enhanced with clear pictorial examples. Makes for easy reading and also a logical sequence for developing the skills in pastels. Good coverage on materials needed, techniques to use, review of Master's works, specific tips on composition types."
2,I was expecting a regular book,"It is too small, I was expecting a regular book not a mini book.the images can not be appreciated."
3,Slack Hangers,I was expecting more substantially constructed pants hangers. These are made from a small diameter metal rod material and are not very stiff. They would not be adequate for very heavy pants. They will work fine for light pants.
1,Small and flimsy,"These hangers are not what I expected. They are small in size and the quality is poor. They dont hold a ""normal"" size pant. They are flimsy and not durable."
2,Hangers seem more appopriate for children.,These hangers are thinner and not as long as others that I have purchased but they are in no way flimsy. I found that it is not as easy to put adult pants onto these hangers in comparison to other pant hangers. I plan to use these hangers for my kids instead. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,These work great for me,"I like these so much I just ordered another set. Yes, the seem small but they're only meant to be used for 1 pair at a time. I'm a size 12 woman and it fits my pants just fine. Everything hands so neatly in a row in my closet now and I can SEE all my slacks whereas before I had them layered on top of eachother on plastic hangars. Very happy with this purchase."
4,Pretty darn near perfect!,These are great and just as described. They hug the closet rod nicely and are a little higher in the neck so longer pants don't end up dragging the floor. The black cover is closer to a rubber material that a velvet which works just as well.My only comment would be to know that the length is a little shorter than I expected. When my husband used these the pants fit nicely but there's a little overhang that might end up causing creases. We just got these so I'm no 100% sure on that. These seem to work better with women's pant.Overall really great and would buy again when more is needed.
4,Good but small,"the product is nice in general and the quality is good, however the size is s bit smaller than what I expected."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I had been looking for this kind of hanger for some time at Walmart and Target but no one ever seemed to have anything like it. When I moved away from home 10 years ago I took the ones that my pants were on. When I got married over 8 years ago my wife needed some so I gave her several. We really needed some because our small closet is more wide open with these hangers going the opposite way so the longer part is sticking in and not out. Anyway, I finally found these and ordered them. They work great. They aren't as heavy duty as the other ones that I have but I think they'll do the job just fine. For pants they are way better than regular hangers."
1,have not received it yet,Its been a week now and the 3 set we ordered got here in a day. Help us find it please!
2,"OK, but not great",These hangers are OK but won't buy any more. They just don't work as well as the clip-hold style hangers.
4,Great for purpose intended,"These are awesome hangers for one pair of light slacks or a few pairs of leggings or yoga pants. The picture show one pair of light slacks on the hanger so that's what you use them for. I am a 133 pound 5'6 woman and my pants fit beautifully. Heavier jeans wouldn't work, but skinny jeans do. Perhaps plus size people or bigger men may have a problem fitting their pants, however."
4,Great for scarves,"Used to create visual storage for scarves in armoire. Good organization tool for closets, armoires,. Now I can see scarves by color, reach and remove quickly and after use return."
4,Good hangers for the price,"As other reviewers have noted, this product is slightly flimsy, but otherwise they work really well. They flex if I try to hang my jeans on them. My wife's pants work perfectly on them since she is quite a bit smaller than myself."
4,Pants Hangers,Space savers that actually keeps your pants in place. They can hold up to two pair per hanger and your pants will not slip off the hanger.
3,They are ok,They are shorter than others I have and very simply made but they work fine. If you are not looking for a great quality but just ok these are it.
2,Child-sized,"I thought these would be a practical solution to trouser management. I thought wrong. While they are certainly sturdy enough, they are not long enough to adequately hold a pair of adult male slacks. It's a good concept & would most likely be great in a child's closet. Not at all constructed for adult clothing."
5,Solidly built hangers that do the job,These hanger were exactly what I was looking for. Pants slide on and off easily without the hanger falling off of the rack or requiring me to pull it off myself each time. They seem steady enough to hold any regular style pants or jeans. I have both hanging and have had no issues whatsoever.
4,Just Hanging Around,"These provide a good way to hang your pants/slacks. The hanging arm could be a bit longer but they should do the job on thinner legged items. In my case (I'm a bigger size), the pants do hang over the edge a bit, but not enough to cause a problem. The metal material in not the heaviest grade, but again should not be a problem unless you want to really pull down on them - don't know why you would. Couple the fact they do what they are meant to do and the really low price and you can't go wrong buying these for your general pant/slack hanging needs."
5,Saves space in both directions!,"I've needed this in my closet for the past 3 years. It's a little too narrow and my doors would hit regular size hangers. These are a bit narrower, but my pants fit on them with room to spare. Plus, it cut the amount of space for my pants by nearly half. Good value for a good well-constructed product. Now only if they made shirt hangers and ones with clips this narrow!"
3,"Good value, but...","These are a good buy but they are lighter than I expected. These will work for summer weight and polyester pants but you still need something heftier for heavier slacks,"
3,It looks great! It plays somewhat ok.,"The graphics are great for the time when it came out. The action levels when you fly the plane are a lot of fun. The problem is that when you get past that part you run into communication issues. You can't really tell what the game designers want you to do. As of this time I still can't find clues to getting past certain parts of the game.I will say that the puzzles do need some thinking, which is great. When you do figure out how to get past a guard or when you take out a room full of guards is very satisfying."
2,Like Sands Through The Hourglass,"This second book in Peter David's post-Excalibur trilogy was even worse than the first. I understand that David is trying to show us the personal lives of these characters as they deal with the loss of their ship and their captain, but was it so necessary to stoop to the level of a Harlequin romance? This entire book, once you removed the un-necessary Danielle Steel plots, could have comprised of four, maybe five, chapters of real material. The whole Selar/Burgoyne issue bordered on the absurd. The only redeeming quality of that plot was the introduction of Selar ""interesting"" brother and the appearance of the classic Trek character. The Robin/Morgan plotline was useless until the last chapter and the classic Trek character that appears in their story is badly written and poorly used. I look forward to finishing this trilogy. Maybe then, we can return to some real writing."
4,florida fun tunes,"This wins the award for one of the most energetic albums of 1999. It seems Spongebath Records doesn't really know how to sign a bad band. These guys are the alternative to the bubblepunk scene currently dominated by Blink 182 and Fenix TX etc..The lyrics are some of the wittiest you're likely to find i.e. 'I'm not looking for you consolation, I think about you during masturbation, You know I'm always gonna jump on your cues, Cos I'm remote controlled by you'. The music stays light and unobtrusive without getting too monotonous. Check it out!"
3,too thick lanolin product,"the product softens the skin, but takes a long time to abosorb. Needs to be thinner. There was a product in the 50's and 60's that mymother used that was easy to use, not thick like this product, absorbed well and softened the skin wonderfully. I'm still looking for that oil. It was simply called Lanolin Oil."
5,Wish it were made into a quality movie,Excellent wrestling book regardless of being a coach or a wrestler. I wish someone could make it into a quality movie. Portrays the burned out and love side for the sport
2,confusing and generalized,"i didnt read saje's book but i did read her poem, Red Under the Skin. She brings up the idea of purity. Being of different religions and backgrounds and essentially gets to the point of how it really shouldnt matter. Well I think it does matter. Nationalistic feelings lie in the hearts of many, even if they dont happen to live in the country at the time. those croats that fought for their country were not as brutal as she made them out to be. and the soldiers that came from around the world to fight for croatia obviously knew what they were fighting for. It wasnt just from what they heard from stories, because if it was they wouldnt of went to fight at all.And she brings up the issue of how we will never be the same color and believe in the same things, which is true so thats why we should stay with our own and not try to ""mix and match"" which will only cause further problems."
5,One Man Made a Big Difference,"Most documentaries and biographies look back on events and maybe recreate some of them. This movie is very special because the camera tags along during the journey of a courageous athlete. The key events are filmed as they occur and are woven into a lovely mural afterward.One man faced his disability head on. He not only overcame his personal limitations; he transcended the conditions presented by his deformed leg. He dedicated his life to serve the higher mission. His deeds have improved the conditions for all of those like him in his homeland of Ghana West Africa. His tenacious actions have changed the perceptions and attitudes of people throughout the country.This is an amazing saga that includes the fields of sports, medicine, charity, politics and education.The story of this man's life has inspired millions from many walks of life in Ghana as well as the USA. The story could inspire you too."
1,Not really a Christian book,"Greg Boyd takes up the noble cause of trying to present answers to very difficult objections of historic Christianity, but in doing so he removes from God much of His 'God-ness'. Greg Boyd's ""God"" is not the God I read in the Bible. His God is not eternal, and does not know what will happen tomorrow. According to Boyd, God has a best-guess at what tomorrow will hold, but in the end tomorrow may surprise him because he can't perfectly see the future, he can only predict it. This is not how God is portrayed in the Bible: ""I am God, and there is none like me. I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come.""Because this is a very, very serious departure from the Christian view of God I do not recommend this book to anybody."
2,Not Very Convincing,"This book was given to me by a minister friend of mine. As is typical of all Christian apologetics, this book has lots of nice-sounding but empty rationalizations for Christian beliefs. Any skeptic with an ounce of critical thinking ability and some familiarity with the facts of ancient history will not find this book the least persuasive. I am offended by this book's implied message that all of us unbelievers are simply ignorant fools who need to be shown the way.The book is well-written and unique enough to earn two stars, but for true skeptics it will probably make you think even less of Christianity than you probably already do."
4,Letters from a skeptic,"I loved the dialogue between Greg and his father, this book raised a lot of great questions that one is sure to hear being a believer. The responses to the questions are well thought out and well written. Great book to read I would recommend to anyone."
5,For the doubter,"These ""letters"" grow from the basic ""why"" to the deeper ""well?"" as you progress through the pages. If you live with doubt or someone close to you is wandering, this answers all Qs."
2,review,"I bought the audio book and it was well-read and held my interest. I am very certain, however, that I would not have stuck with it if I were actually reading the book. I simply wouldn't have waded through the heavy doses of philosophy -- but I could easily tune them out for a few minutes."
2,Bad Theology,"Boyd has some great things to say in many of the chapters. Unfortunately, when he has to deal with evil and suffering, he exposes his bad theology. Boyd is an open theist, which means God is limited in his ability to do anything. He is only able to react to our decisions and only in a way that does not interfere with our free will. This is an attempt to get God off the hook for all the bad things that happen, but we end up with a very weak God."
2,God knows everything,"This is a very personal review from me based on what I believe as a Lutheran. I do not believe that we have free will in spiritual matters so I had a problem with that concept in the dialog with the Father. When it came to the statement that God doesn't know future free actions, it was time for me to close the book. I believe that God is all-knowing and that His actions or lack of, do not require my understanding. He is God and Scripture assures me that all things work together for good for the faithful even when it can't be seen that way at the time. Our understanding of things have limitations. However, by faith, I have to trust in the God who has all understanding."
4,Interesting thought provoking book.,"This book is very thought provoking and enjoyable. His conclusions were good on the questions, but I didn't rate it five stars because I don't agree with Dr. Boyd theologically on some points. Disclaimer: I'm just a little old lady and he is a great theologian."
4,enlightening!,Very enlightening read! I really enjoyed the letters between a son and Father and found the book to be inspirational and able to answer difficult questions in laymen's terms.
4,Very interesting approach to apologetics.,I got this book when it was free and was delighted to get such an interesting book. I liked the conversational tone.
2,"Bad Theology mixed with good theology,","I disagree with much of what he writes, and taking the skeptical view, I find it very unconvincing. Taking it from a Christian view, this book is not just challenging, but rejecting, many things that make God who He is. This books gets two stars just for a good effort, and the few things he gets right."
2,Family Letters,"This author is certainly intelligent and scholary, and I enjoyed the manner in which the book was written as an endearing dialogue between father and son. Many answers given by the author were concise and suitable; however, the author's open view of God is not the biblical view of God. For this reason alone, I hesitate to recommend this book knowing that naive readers may pick up on his unorthodox descriptions of the God of Christianity. If someone is looking for solid Christian apologetics, I would recommend Josh McDowell over this particular author."
1,"not recommended, too many heterodox opinions mixed in","This book is far from recommended. Mixed in with all the good material is too much heterodoxy, speculation, opining, Harvard philosophy, unbiblical fabrication.Try Josh McDowell, James Kennedy, Hank Hanegraaff, Os Guiness, C.S.Lewis instead for safer, less contaminated apologetics."
4,Blessed,I am really enjoying the letters and love. Words between a father and son. Having a hard time putting it down!
5,Wonderful guidance for sharing faith in Christ,"This book was a wonderful way to give ideas for answering the questions of skeptics, which most all believers had to some extent. The author's love for his father is so evident throughout the book, and the end result is very uplifting."
4,Letters from a sceptic: a son wrestles with his fathers questions,Rite of passage into a personal faith by a pk. Interesting and humorus. Would recommend this to any who are searching.
4,Quite interesting,A nice batch of letters between father and son. Some are more meaty than others. There are some very good arguments for the existence of a higher power (i.e. God) here and it is interesting to see the father struggle thru his tough questions until the end of the book. Recommended.
1,Con game or what?,"After perusing the Chapter heads, I went to the study guide and worked back sampling the text. Though it may be unjustified, I couldn't help thinking ""this could be a real con job!"". Doesn't it seem more than likely that the letters were intended for publication from the beginning, so the conclusion was fore-gone! The book would not have been published if the father hadn't been born again! Shallow, at best!"
4,Effective but 1st part Flawed,There are some really questionable opinions of God presented in the first few chapters. It is quite unsettling. But the book definitely improves greatly if you stick it out.
5,Thought-provoking,"I thought the book was a great idea and well written. Certainly one to spur some serious thought for Christians and skeptics alike. I think Greg Boyd does a good job hitting on the big issues/questions and generally answers them very well. Can't say I agree with 100% of the book, but it's well grounded in the truth, and the disagreements I have are pretty insignificant ones. Highly recommended."
5,Skeptic,"Amazing read!Once I started this book I absolutely couldn't put it down, and once finished all I want to do is go back and reread it with a new perspective."
5,This is a WOW!,"I have always struggled with books that make the automatic assumption that those we try to share our faith with accept the premise that the Bible IS the Word of God. If that is not the case, all the helpful ""tips"" that follow are out the door. This book starts, literally, at square one. It is a must have in anyone' s library that has loved ones that are not yet walking with Christ."
3,A good start with some problems,"Although I disagree with Dr. Boyd's theology on several points over all I think this is a good book for Christians to read to learn how to address problems our unsaved friends and family have with orthodox Christianity. I especially enjoyed the no holds barred attitude Dr. Boyd's dad had about asking the tough questions.I am not sure I would give this book to a non-Christian or a new Christian b/c of Dr. Boyd's unbiblical view of God's ominiscience and sovereignty. However, I did find this book helpful b/c of its thoughtful, honest, and loving approach to a discussion about God."
2,Boyd Compromises Scripture for love of father,"Though there is much good in this book, it is disturbing that Dr. Boyd compromises Scripture out of love for his father. In an effort to alleviate one of the obstacles keeping his father from embracing Christianity, Boyd responds that God did not know the future choices Hitler would make when God created him. Jesus's interaction with Peter at the Last Supper is just one example showing us that this is not true. Jesus knew that Peter would disown him, yet was already praying that Peter would strengthen the others after he had turned back. Jesus' forknowledge enables him to be more personal, not impersonal as Dr. Boyd's father feared. In our love for the lost, we must guard against the temptation to make God into something less than He is."
3,Typical Christian comebacks.,"I am a skeptic and still I am not so convinced. Father's questions are most similar to the questions I have raised.But I wasn't impressed with the son's responses.They were almost same to the ones you get from any typical Christian person would tell a non-believer, except at some points of leniency.(such as not taking the Bible ""literally"")It also lacks what happens after each question was answered, because his father couldn't have just converted his views so easily after one letter of answer. I still have questions at the answers the son gave but the book does not say much after once the question is answered.Overall, just a triumph book for a Christian, failed to really make a skeptic think any differently."
5,Foundations of faith,"This is an excellent book for all those who like the challenge of asking many questions about their basic Christian convictions. The author's father, the skeptic, asked many important questions about the nature of God, the problem of evil, human freedom and sufering, the Bible, heaven and hell, sin, etc. The son tries to answer these complex questions, and one might not always agree with his explanations. But they do provide further food for thought. Letters from a Skeptic will make you think and may result in some lively discussions with fellow believers, agnostics, atheists, and members of other faiths!"
2,"Good idea, poor design follow through","Same light as sold by Target and other places, only sometimes referred to as space traveller lamp. Product should have been great but when I got it, the threads in the lamp were faulty and hard to put together because the factory didn't install the poles correctly."
5,Great Flavor,"A Dutch/Belgian coffee with great flavor. The blend is ground from Arabica and Robusta beans, not Arabica.Thank you Amazon for bringing one more international flavor to the US."
5,Best coffee ever!!,I had this coffee at a hotel once and fell in love with it. I searched everywhere and finally found it here. It is a little pricey but my husband and I use it only on the weekends as a treat. Very smooth.
5,Gotta have it!,"This book is an excellent resource for anyone visiting Disneyland with children. Although my husband and I have been to Disneyland many times, this was our first time there with our kids. We learned so many new things about the park thanks to this book. It tells you which areas, rides, or shows to do first and which would be better to do later in the day. It gives suggestions for avoiding crowds, descriptions of places to eat (including price ranges and kid-friendly ratings), and lots of fun trivia and things to look for. We really appreciated the detailed information about the rides and shows so we could decide whether it was appropriate for our children. The book even gives a ""Scare Factor"" for each ride so you know how scary it might be. I definately would not go to Disneyland without this book!"
3,Good basic information,"I picked up this book because it covered serveral Southern California attractions we plan to visit. While we have not taken our Disneyland trip I was disappointed with this book. There was a lot of information, but not was I was looking for. For instance, the hotels had some basic information, but nothing that told you which were the best, most convenient, etc. I have used the Unofficial Guide for past trips to WDW that was much more comprehensive and helpful. On the other hand, it had information on Legoland and Knotts Berry Farm that I have not seen in other books."
3,"Helpful, but not somewhat out of date","We traveled w/ young children (4 & 6). This book was great for it's rating of the rides as far as which the kids were most likely to be scared of and other great ideas for making a trip w/ kids easier. However we found much of the information out of date. Such as they referrenced many shows at DisneyLand that had been replaced by other shows. They also referenced that you needed tickets to the Aladdin show at CA Adventure, but this is no longer the case. So while I found quite a bit of good information in this book, I much preferred The Unofficial Guide to Disneyland 2005, which had the most accurate and up to date information of any of the books I purchased prior to our trip."
2,Probably good,"I cannot buy this because there is no way to listen to it on line and I have never heard it before, I just like Batucada. But need to hear a clip."
2,Wait for a better book.,"The book explained a lot of the theoretical concepts behind Active Directory in clear, easy to understand language. However, I found it difficult to follow several key examples because the book is based on RC1, and I have RC2 of server. If you just want theory, it's better to read Microsoft white papers. If you want real live examples that you can follow, wait for a better book."
4,NEW BOOK FOR NEW TOPIC- WIN2000,"YOU CAN LEARN IT STEP BY STEPIF YOU ARE USING NT4, IT IS MORE USEFUL BECAUSE THE BOOK SHOW HOW NT4 CHANE INTO WINDOWS 2000.EASY TO READ, UP-TO-POINT"
1,Old outdated books bundled with 1 valualbe book.,"Instead of 'Learning vi', 'Learning GNU Emacs' whould be better or need to come together. Or at least it should be the 6th edition. 'Sed & awk' is outdated by 'Learning Perl'. Why not 'Learing the bash shell' or 'Using csh & tcsh' than 'Learning the korn shell'? Even 'unix in a nutshell' contains a lot of outdated material. 'Unix power tools' is handy in online."
5,Pooh is just too cute,"This is part of a theme set from Royal Doulton, although I only purchased this piece. I don't know why, but it struck me as overly cute. It is what you would expect, a nice piece of high quality ceramic from Royal Doulton. Recommended for any Winnie the Pooh fan."
4,Loads o fun,"I remember when this game first came out it was really astounding. It was completly original, which was ver refreshing. The game plays like a movie, your goal is to foil the bad guys by springing traps on them at the right time. I still enjoy playing this from time to time. A must have if u own a Saturn, cuz face it there wasnt to many hot titles for the system anyhow."
4,Sandalwood loves Lemon,"This is my simplest fragrance. It's lemon and sandalwood. It smells EXACTLY like a lemon, and exactly like sandalwood. It's 100% lemon for the first 30 minutes - then the sandalwood comes in. After an hour it smells like 80% sandalwood, 20% lemon. If that sounds good to you, you need this bottle. Too bad it lasts around 4 hours to my nose - it's so light! I sprayed 8 times, and it's still light, so minus one star.L'eau d'Issey smells like sea salt + lemon, and lasts around 10 hours. This smells like sandalwood + lemon, and lasts around 4 hours. I would rather smell like this for 4, than d'Issey for 10.The bottle looks cheap and opaque in the picture, but it's frosted translucent glass - it looks great in person.The original Balmain came out in the 60's. This is the 1990 version. It's been around for over 40 years and I never heard of it until a week ago. People don't know this scent. You'll be the only guy wearing this sexy fragrance within a 20 mile radius."
2,Needs improvement to be user-friendly!,"Although there was a wealth of information within the book, it was almost impossible to locate through the Index. If you are trying to find an explanation or discussion quickly, do not bother with this book, as we found it necessary to leaf through pages and scan for key words, which often were noted museums, churches, palaces, etc.For ease of use, and because of its weight, it should be separated into 2-3 volumes. We stopped carrying it very soon after arriving in Eastern Europe."
2,Too Manly for a woman.,I purchased this perfume for my mother for mother's day. Mom passed away on may 30th. When I found the perfume on the night stand I finally got to smell it. It smells like a man's cologne. Not at all feminine. I will never purchase perfume online again and am truly sorry that this was the last gift I ever gave my mother. To let you know that its not just me The bottle was completly full and I tried like hell to give this away no one would take it man or woman. Every one says it stinks. And it is marketed as a unisex scent not women's as it says here.
3,Wasn't what i expected,"And can't remember why I got it, other than he is the husband of one of my favorite authors. Guess that's why."
5,A Dream for making candy!,"I received this pan yesterday and after a quick wash, went right to work with the fudge recipe I always make each year. The straight sides hold the candy thermometer perfectly, the depth left just a little room to not worry about boil-over, and the lack of non-stick coating under such high heat conditions left me feeling the fudge would be free of nasty toxins. This is a very sturdy, heavy saucepan with a long cool handle. I am so very pleased! Lifetime warrenty, too! Very high quality!"
5,An essential reference for VB programmers,Extremely useful for all levels of experience. O'Reilly books are clear and concise and I have never regretted buying one on any subject. Lomax has done VB'ers a great service..
2,Maybe VB but not VBA,"For the basics of programming in VB this may well be a good book but if you're an experienced programmer and want to dive in at the deep end and program in VBA for Excel, Word etc then this book won't help you much. Better to buy Walkenbach, Green or Kofler. For a terse, precise clarification of language syntax it gets top marks."
5,Top Quality,"This is a jewel...a gem...(even an encrusted studded egg) that I use on a regular basis. If you do VB/VBA programming, get it. It is one of the most referred-to books on my bookshelf. Quality through and through. Excellent job Paul Lomax & O'Reilly!"
4,GOOD VBA RESOURCE,"I found this book very helpful, but most useful as a reference material. It is a great book to have at your side when you need to check syntax problems, or find a specific function. Although, the material could be arranged in a better manner, you can usually find what you need in this book.As far as VBA projects go, this book was somewhat lacking. There are plenty of books that have much 'neater' projects in them (the undisputed king is Learn Word 2000 VBA Document Automation - author: scott driza).There are also better VBA books for beginners (Developing Solutions with Office 2000 Components adn VBA - author: Peter Aiken).However, for the money, I'd say that this should definitely be on your bookshelf."
4,"A reference for experienced VB, C++ Windows programmers","Not for learning, not for programmers with limited Windows experience, not a textbook, more of a reference tool for experienced VB, C++ developers."
4,Good for beginners too!!,I am very new to programming. I ignored the previous recommendations mentioning that this book was not for begginers and I ordered it anyway. I have read the first three chapters straight through and used much of the book as a reference which I beleive it was meant to be. I found this book together with Access 2002 Desktop Developer's Handbook and Access 97 Macro and VBA Handbook gives me a better understanding of the VBA language. The book is informative and is a fairly easy read. I would recommend this book to any beginner that is serious about learning VBA.
3,airforce Nutrisoda - Tangerine and Lime,"Relatively bland flavor, but I can honestly say I did not get sick while drinking it."
1,terrible,"unstated that this was a lat release, doesnt even have the correct card in the package most likely a very late release or remake . not very happy with product gave to my nephew for a present. broke with in a couple hours."
2,Makes a mess!,No matter what amount of pressure I ran through these misters they dripped bad and made a mess.I do not see how this product would be good for people.
3,Kind of disappointed,"The product did well for cooling off the folk on the deck, but I couldn't give more than 3 stars because the plastic/metal clips rusted and broke after less than a month."
5,Attach misting system to a fan works great!,"I have tried several different misting systems, pvc etc.. and the best solution I have found is to just take this system as it is pictured and fasten to the front of any oscillating fan. Just remember to leave the portion without the nozzles free so you can connect to your garden hose. I used plastic zip strips to do the fastening then just pointed all the nozzles facing out and turned on fan and water. Works great if you are laying in the sun or turn on the oscillation to cool a wider area. This also helps solve the problem of things getting wet at it's not facing the same direction all the time. Also if you do place the fan far enough away from you, you won't get wet. Let me know what you think if you try this."
4,Great! Fast Shipping!,"It's not a very hot summer, so I wanted to use something in place of the AC for the time being. This was a very nice cheap alternative for the hottest parts of the day.The item is exactly as described, and functions well so far.Here's what I didn't like - The clips. I ended up using some nail down cat 5 clips so I could orient the nozzles where I wanted them.Also - I really wanted the 1/2"" couplers but at 18$ or so it seemed like an extreme expense. When reading the fine print they are a 5 pack. So for about 30$ I could have made the same system with 1/2"" PVC. I'm moving soon, so these will be employed!"
5,Fantastic!,"Not a single issue. Bought two, and connected them. Misters work great. Can hang anywhere. Spray nossles twist right on. Perfect spray, even flow."
4,It just works!,"I had never had a mister before but wanted to try one out before the summer months really kicked in. This mister is wonderful. It puts out a nice mist and my two young daughters like it more then a sprinkler because t does not really get them wet, it just makes them damp. And it cools off their slide. The only down side is that the misters do not swivel in their tubing so we have mist going every direction, which is okay in our application. I also did get the screen and used a cotton ball trick to keep stuff from clogging the heads, seems to be working great so far."
1,outdoor mister,Not too great. Better off buy one with a thicker hose and better nozzles. The nozzles rust and clog this and render it useless. I either recommend storing this in motor oil or not wasting your money
1,Causes cancer?,"Isn't anyone concerned about the warning message on this package and that it is made in country know for shipping toxic products to the US, China?WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer, birth defects, and other reproductive harm."
4,Great product for the price,"The product was extremely easy to install, and the misting is sufficient, while you could get a little damp sitting under the misters for an extended period. I agree with other reviewers that the inability to adjust the direction of the misters is a drawback."
3,Meets claim but....,We bought the Orbit mister to reduce the temperature in our chicken coop during 100 plus degree days we have been experiencing in Texas. Our chicken coop is an enclosed room within a barn and has a concrete floor with shavings on the floor. We were using a large fan in addition to the mister. The mister did reduce the temperature in the area by 10 to 20 degrees but it created so much dampness it was unacceptable for use in our application. The relative humidity in the closed area got so high there was water everywhere. Perhaps used outside the moisture would not be a problem but in the enclosed area it did not work well.
4,Helps to cool but dependent on the wind,This mister works great especially by the pool when laying out and you are near by it but if you are far from it the breeze can direct it pretty easily and it can miss you altogether. All in all its a good product but next time I would purchase the option directional heads to help put the mist where I need it
2,It was a learning curve,This was my first attempt with a misting system. It's very simple and easy to install - just in time to have the sub-quality nozzles fizzle until you are down to one working nozzle in less than 2 months time. Not worth the trouble of uninstalling and returning BUT now that I know more about them I'll be looking for better quality misting systems through Amazon.
1,It's just like his other book!,I have read every available book on the subject of Jonestown. This author has written a book similar to this book with similar information. The author is trying to make the argument against group criticism and treatment. Jonestown and the People's Temple were not alone in having humiliating events of group criticism and embarrassment of a member in front of Jim Jones as part of his so-called therapy. The connection between group criticism and Jonestown is obvious. The reason that I can't rate this book any higher than the lowest rating is the author's anti-semitic and anti-Zionistic views and reasoning. He also gets some information wrong about the Layton family. But the author does have a valid point about the group criticism and therapy which has been reformed since this book was originally published to be accepted in the psychiatric community. But I couldn't get past the author's bias and prejudices which makes it difficult to accept this book as legitimate.
2,came broken in the package,"this figure could've been better it has a nice paint job good articulation but his arm was ripped when i opened him up, it came broken? but now i cannot display because his arm will fall soon. so he just stays in my closet waiting for the garbage."
3,Just fun to destroy the cages,Had this game when I was a lot younger bought it again for the pure fun of destroying the cages with the super kicks.
5,"The Jewel Tea Company, It's History and Products",It is exactly what I was looking for. A very comprehensive book about Jewel Tea dishes. Lots of great pictures too
2,Flimsy,"I bought these purely b/c it was the best deal for recycled paper plates. The plates are so flimsy, you need a few plates together to keep it steady. I can't really use these, except for a veryyyyy casual BBQ."
2,Doesn't save paper if you have to use so many plates,"Overall, I like Seventh Generation products, and use many of them. However, these plates are almost useless. They are very flimsy--in order to have it be remotely sturdy you have to use 2-3 at least. Olive oil (from sauteeing) goes through them so quickly you have to use more plates so the grease doesn't get on your lap."
3,"Better, but not Blue Drops","I fell in love with Corey's music on Blue Drops of Rain, a five star album. Road to Zen, the follow up, was good but a slight down turn. Getaway had a couple of good songs but that was it. Bring on the Blues is better than Getaway but still doesn't reach Road to Zen or Blue Drops of Rain. The reworking of the song Getaway is great, and the highlight of the album. Great guitar tone here. It is much better that the version on the album Getaway and seems to have better recording quality. Triple Jack is also a highlight along with the album's opener. I have to say that Corey spent too much time on slow acoustic tunes which are not my favorite. He still has yet to write a slow blues song that is nearly as cool as It's Over from Blue Drops. A step in the right direction but I hope to see something closer to Blue Drops in the future. A good album, however, and I am glad I bought it."
5,Great album here,"Folks, stop comparing him to SRV and stop saying this is not a very good album! WHO CARES?!? This is great music. I was pumped when I saw this. It's got some killer blues and some good rock songs. This is one of the best albums out right now. Supports musicians like this that are actually playing good music. Not many of them left. Get this record...killer."
4,best album since blue drops,after a couple of years off from recording corey has come back with probably his most original album.the songs go from standard shuffles and slow blues to hendrix style songs like your evil which is excellent. also my blues are turning red is a great rocker along with the c.d.s opening cut. highly recommend this c.d.
5,Alte Tränen,"Du wirst nie vergessen. Eine der tief- und feinsinnigsten Keyboarderinen und sänderinen, die es je in Deutschland gab. Viel zu früh verstorben. R.H., ich verstehe, dass Du 10 Jahre keine Musik mehr nach ihrem tod machen konntest. Mach auch für sie weiter."
2,Too slippery,"No matter what I do, I cannot get this mat to stop being slippery. I followed all the recommendations about washing it in the shower before use, and we bought special cleaning spray from our yoga studio. Very disappointing. The cheaper sticky mats are much better."
5,This is the master that Dave Sanborn stole from,"This is one of the best albums I own out of 2000+ records. The magic is there! This album should be studied in every music school for feel, groove, communication w/ listeners and musicality. If you play sax, keys, bass, conga, drums, guitar, trumpet, organ...this is a MUST CD.I thought this album was lost as I hadn't seen it anywhere for 20+ yrs. The only thing I ever saw, which made me mad as hell, was one night back in the 80's Dave Sanborn was on Late Night w/ Letterman and introduced a copy of the first cut of this album as ""his song HE wrote"" as ""Love stew"" or something like that...Never saying that the whole arrangment and even most all of Daves solo was just a copy of Memphis Soul Stew. Another case of the white man stealing the blackman's ideas...and making a ton of money off it!"
2,godfather of muzak?,"How this album made the greatest live album list is beyond me. Replacing lyrics with sax solos in songs is hard to pull off, even for a master such as King Curtis. Versions of Whiter Shade of Pale, and Whole Lotta Love are truly awful and cheesy. The majority of the album ain't much better, with Memphis Soul Stew, I Stand Accused, and Soul Serenade being the exceptions. The add on of My Sweet Lord as a bonus track is also a good listen. With six good tracks(two being alternate versions) out of fourteen, needless to say, I do not like this album. If you want some good King Curtis, I suggest King Curtis and Champion Jack Dupree-Blues at Montreux."
1,Extremely disappointed,"Being a huge Duane Allman fan, I bought this CD simply because Duane raved about it during one of the Allman Brothers Band's performances which I have on CD. I don't think I've ever been more disenchanted with a CD as I was with this one. It is a total yawner. Curtis--an admittedly terrific sax player when he wanted to be--steps out and steps up for maybe 30 seconds total on the first and last tracks, otherwise I heard nothing very special from him. If somebody wants this 1999 CD in once-played condition, I'll send it to you for $5. ralphboineau@hotmail.com"
2,there are better purchases,Check out the king/aretha disc set instead. Better sound quality for what I imagine are the same shows. Otherwise stick to some of his studio work. Playing this in multiple cars it just sounds muddy where the aretha set (4 cds) has much better if not fantastic sound.
5,As good as it gets,"This record demonstrates as well as any what happens when you put great, mature, seasoned veteran musicians together on a stage. This may have been King's band and he was certainly the 'icing on the cake' but without Jerry Jemmott, Cornell Dupree, Billy Preston and Bernard Purdie it would never have been the same. As a bass player I stand in awe of Jerry's playing. To hear him play with Bernard Purdie and Cornell Dupree and hear how they push the groove like perhaps no other rhythm section before or since is simply breath taking. I dare some one to listen to 'Memphis Soul Stew' and not get chills when King brings the whole band to a searing boil.I believe this record should be in everybody's collection. No exception. Why? Because this is as good as it gets."
2,Not impressed,"I like the Starbucks Via instant coffee, but would rather support another company instead of Starbucks every day, and I wanted to have organic coffee. I got this based on the great reviews, but I didn't like the taste of the coffee, nor was I impressed at how well it dissolved in water. I begrudgingly drank it every day until it was gone."
2,"sadly, I am not impressed","Ditto. I am not impressed. This is an OK coffee, but no more than that, while, say, Davidoff Coffee that Amazon sells also, being much superior, excells in taste in quality... I am a Davidoff fan now. Never again, Mount Hagen! Get lost!"
5,Organic Instant!!,Mine and a friend and family favorite!! I hate that it has to come from Germany. When will a savvy USA coffee company offer delicious instant organic coffee??
1,bitter as hell!,"i honest don't get how people can drink this stuff. i read an offical review about how bitter this stuff was and i had to agree. caffeine hits ok, but nothing special. compared with folgers instant when it was good, its no contest. 4tsp of folgers instant used to do it, really powerful stuff. this is not powerful stuff."
5,The Best instant coffee there is!,"This coffee is the best instant coffee we have ever had and it is organic yet so it is also the healthiest coffee you can buy. My husband only drinks this coffee, he had put away the coffee make altogether."
4,Smooth instant coffee,"A co-worker introduced me to Mount Hagen instant coffee. The flavor is as close to brewed coffee as I have ever tasted in an instant product. It doesn't have that initial bitterness that causes one to wince at the first sip. But this coffee is hard to find in bricks and mortar stores, so I was glad to find it on Amazon.Mount Hagen Organic Freeze Dried Instant Coffee, 3.53-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)"
3,OK cofffee,Really can't understand why anyone would give this 5 stars as it's just O K coffee. Nothing at all special.
4,all except the packaging,"Excellent coffee. With warmed milk tastes just like a very good Latte. Much better than Starbucks.I have them deliver me a case every three months, a significant savings from retail and never have to fuss with a coffee maker again.However at my first delivery I found one jar broken and the box awash in coffee bits. They cushioned the jars around but not above and below. Major bummer. Do better or I'll have to cancel my standing order."
5,Great Organic Coffee,"I've been told I have an allergy to pesticides used in many coffees. I can drink this one all day. Great flavor, I make it as strong or weak I want at the moment. Very happy with Mount Hagen Organic Freeze Dried Instant Coffee."
2,Huh?,"After reading many of the reviews for this instant coffee, I thought I'd try some. It tastes exactly like every other instant coffee - no better, no worse. I was expecting more based on the reviews. I'll keep looking."
1,broken jar,"One of the jars was broken, though the packaging (bubble wrap) seemed to be intact. The coffee was scattered all over the inside of the box. The five remaining jars of coffee were not broken and, once wiped off, the product seems to be good. Not sure how one jar was completely smashed. I have not received a replacement for this one jar of coffee. I expect a replacement or a credit."
1,Mount Hagen Organic Freeze Dried Instant Coffee,"Instant coffee can be good tasting; Mount Hagen has misses the mark. Mount Hagen tastes like freeze dried coffees of old. Nescafé makes a good tasting dark roast instant coffee, unfortunately it's not organic and won't be any time soon. Such is life."
5,The Best Coffee on The Planet,"This is by far the best coffee i've ever had, bar none! Great flavor and it's instant and Organic can it get any better???"
4,Finally-can get into bed,This arrived quickly and with instructions. I am not handy and it was not as easy to put together because there were extra parts. But it is sturdy and looks very nice.
4,Hasta La Victoria Siempre,"This DVD is way to short to deal with Che's Biography, so it resorts to a few episodes of his fighting days in the Sierra Maestre and his untimelyend in Bolivia. It describes it's interaction with his Comrades:Disziplinary actions, ideological discussions, dealing with captured enemy soldiers, with the civil population, his plight as a doctor and philosophical dialogs with Fidel. There are a lot of battlescenes in this DVD, but not in a Rambo style, more like displaying the tragedy and sadness of human struggle. There is a beautyful scene with a peasant women, played by Sonia Braga, talking to Che. It is being rumored, that Sonia Braga wanted a chance to talk to Che, like She would have done in real life. A wonderful and passionate speach, I might say.I would have given this movie 5 stars, if it would have been at least 8 hours long, like a miniseries, without using the flash-back style.Something I still desire to see. So it's 4/5 stars."
3,Getting there!,"It is the Web episodes with the fun gang. Follow their MMO/RL on YouTube through Geek&Sundry. Excellent thirs season. I like their extra stuff, it is a lot of bang for the bucks!"
5,Love it!,"The cast and crew are amazing! Careful if your ears are sensitive, the Axis of Anarchy have f bombs and they know how to use 'em. But I still love this season none the less. :)"
4,Love it!,"I'm not a gamer, though my daughter is -- thank goodness. When we watched the first seasons of this wonderful show, she explained a lot of the terms etc. to me. She's now married and living elsewhere, but I still loved Season 3 of this show, and hope Felicia and her group make more. Love this so much, it makes me wish I could go through the trauma of being a newb and joining a guild."
3,the guild is cool,awesome show and series however the dvd won't work on alot of Australian dvd players due to region restrictions
5,Felicia Day and company do it again,"Well, season 3 is even better than seasons 1 and 2. The world of The Guild gets bigger and more complicated this season, with new characters, more drama, more silly and funny stuff than before. What an amazing cast. Very funny performers. Keep doing this Felicia; we'll keep watching!"
5,The Guild - Season 3 - Another great collection of funny videos,"I've been a follower of The Guild for quite awhile now, and have purchased all 3 seasons of their Internet shows.If you are an online World of Warcraft game player, this series of short scenarios which highlight the life of a small group of MMORPG game players who are in the same ""guild"" in the game is funny and very entertaining, or it sure is entertaining for me.It's very well done, quite creative, and the shows are short. A whole season at a time on each disk. I found it well worth buying."
5,All the Epic Laughs with zero Fail.,"Yet another great season of The Guild. The expansion of the character base with improvements to production quality continue to astound and entertain. We learn more of the characters and their outside lives. Rivalries are born and the repercussion of decisions carries us through a very turbulent third season. Friends and family who aren't even gamers find the series quirky and humorous. The Guild is what it is... something fresh and different, with actors and writers not afraid to march to the beat of their own drum. I hope to see a Season Four in the works and wish the cast and crew continued success."
5,Felicia Day... What else can I say?,"The third season of The Guild was as good or better than the prior two seasons. For those of us who enjoy watching it on our TVs, this is the perfect way to get it, though I have to admit, I did watch it online this season, I just couldn't wait to see it.I think that buying the DVD is a great way to show support for Felicia and all of her cast mates. Plus I like the idea of supporting something that hasn't sold out to the commercial industrial complex... oh, wait... didn't she make a video about that?Anyway, Felicia is awesome and I just love her work, please make more!"
2,Glitches Galore.,"Let me begin by saying I love The Guild. I watch it online when new episodes come out, and was first inline to get the dvd (or at least I like to think). I was distressed to find when I got the DVD that the audio was fine for the first half of the season, then inexplicably became unsynced. I tried it on several different dvd players and it happened on all of them. Was like watching one of those badly dubbed Godzilla movies. I asked for a replacement and the same issue occured with an added bonus!: A very nasty glitch that prevented me from continuting on with the season. No visible scratches or blemishes adorned the disk, so I assume it was in the burning of the disk itsself. Amazon refused to send me a third. I'm not sure of the quality of the dvd itsself. I had no troubles with seasons 1 or 2, but I've had more troubles with 3 then I've ever had with a dvd. I hope to see many more episodes of The Guild in the future, but I am dismayed with the state of this release."
3,Transfer to DVD messed up audio...,"I love The GUILD. It's a fantastic web series. However, the DVD transfer definitely messed up the audio. At the start of each episode you can barely hear the audio for at least 3-5 seconds then it normalizes."
5,So glad to find this enshrined on DVD,"If you enjoy the wit and drollery of BTVS and the Lovely Slayerettes, you'll really enjoy this series from Felicia Day. She writes, She Acts, She SCORES! Its a charmingly funny look at the world of online gamers and their world of winsome wackyness.I'm delighted to see such a delicate wit... Felicia Day I'd like to see more of your writing and wish that some of this would make it to Prime Time TV.Love her and I love the tone of this work!Pat"
3,Fun hack n slash with good digitized graphics,"I am a new Saturn owner having missed it and all these fun games the first time around. This game is fun. Graphics are nice but not amazing. There is good atmosphere and animations as you slash the skeletons. I dont think there is any comparison with Shinobi Legions. Legions does it all so much better, but this one is fun and easy to get into with a fun story."
2,Not what they appear to be!,The picture is so beautiful but it is also very magnified. These earrings are thin and flimzy. Would not buy again.
3,"Like Saturn, Like This","Rating it as a modern videogame, it gets a 1.5, as a Saturn game it gets a 4, so I give a 3 or so. It can be rather intersting at times, sneaking through martian tunnels attacking aliens, but this games has serious flaws. The mission briefing videos are pathetic, the save game feature is baddly designed, there are limited lives(in a first person shooter!) and it isn't properly explained. Like when it wants you to use a minning explosive to blow up a refinery, there are lots of mines and power-ups and the mining explosive is one time use only, and it's hard to tell which weapon is which. Despite it's flaws, if you own a Saturn and you want some games, buy this."
5,One of the best Dark Chocolates we have had,What else can I say... Dark chocolates (Esp with higher cocoa content) have a bitter after-taste.. but the touch of orange makes it just perfect. Absolutely delicious and HEALTHY.
2,"A priest, a nun, a beezlebub","TERROR PACK is a little set of fright films that are of little consequence. These indie-made trifles are best left to the hardcore gore fans. Amateurish acting, bad scripts and cheap special effects make this one a ""no-go"" for sure!BLOOD BATH 4 MOVIE PACKis a small collection of shudder cinema sure to shock!SYNOPSES:""Hellinger"" - A priest makes a deal with Satan and is transformed into Hellinger, a blood-thirsty demon.""Holy Terror"" - The spirit of a demon-possessed nun forced to do Satan's bidding returns to life and brings hellfire to a house-warming party.""Insaniac"" - An amnesiac placed under hypnosis has terrifying visions that may be clues to why she's ill..Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to10 viewer poll ratings found at a film resource website.(2.1) Hellinger (1997) - Solomon Cobbitt/Shana Sosin/James M.

3,Disappointing,"This young woman is an extremely talented singer. She is also very charming and attractive. After seeing her in Chasing Papi, I admired her youthful vigor. And that beautiful black hair is stunning. She has a beautiful voice. The CD is produced well.But...But the sound is little different than every other female contemporary christian music singer. So if that's what you want, then fineI was hoping that this young lady would bring the world something different. I thought perhaps that her Latin background would bring a new spice into the contemporary christian music scene. But instead, it was the other way around. The contemporary christian family friendly happy suburban American world has made its mark on her."
4,Great story line but needed more passion,"I have loved everything from the Love Comes Softly series, but this one was a little disappointing. It seemed to get bogged down in the middle and drag one of the scenes out too long. It ends happy enough though, but there wasn't enough romance for me."
5,Completion of collection,My husband had bought the set of the Love comes softly movies a few years ago. When ever I saw another movie on TV I would try to find it so I could add to the colletion.
5,Love's Christmas Journey,"This is a very well-made film, with fine acting, interesting characters and a good story, plus a Christmas theme.I heartily recommend it!"
5,loved it,i love this series and this was good. it was a little slow at times but it was clean and family friendly.
5,Loves christmas journey,"Wow! Words fail me now. I can't explain this movie and the way it moved me, I was hooked from beginning to the end. Don't take my word for it though, buy it to experience it all."
5,Great movie,"Really like this dvd, very strong characters, a very christian family movie. You will love watching this movie with your children."
4,Love's Christmas Journey,"Wonderful movie, except that the angel was called Nicholas, his name should have been Gabriel, like the angel that told Mary of Jesus' birth, since this is a Christmas story. Santa (St. Nicholas) is not capable of what this angel did, with God's help!Also, only God can make it snow :)! Otherwise it was a very good movie."
2,Very Disappointed,"Loved every single one of the Love Softly DVD series. Watch them over and over again. There is so much inspiration in all of them.This one does not hold a candle to any of those. Even though it goes back in time and follows Missy's stepbrother and their younger sister, Ellie, it doesn't follow with the other movies at all.It is a corny movie without inspirational themes to it like all the other movies. Not only is it corny but it is so predictable throughout. If you can figure out the whole movie at every scene, it doesn't allow the viewer to appreciate what is going to happen in the story. I really missed Michael Landon, Jr. He was the one who made the other movies my favorites.Give it a chance....but still enjoyed all the others much more."
4,Wonderful Luther collection but...,"This is a great collection from the master, Mr. Luther Vandross. No one will EVER fill this man's shoes.One omission for me was Til My Baby Comes Home, which I love. But another questionable decision was using the shorter version of Stop to Love. Since this is an ""Essential..."" collection, it should have included the longer version of the song. Dumb.But just to hear this amazing voice on song after song, listening to it rise and fall and peak and dip is truly a wondrous experience.Luther Vandross will be definitely missed but with collections like these, we can all relive the magic of that incredible voice over and over again. The man may have gone but his artistry and his silky smooth voice will always be with us."
3,Missing verses from songs,"I started by purchasing individual tracks from this album and now realize that some songs have verses missing. For example, the fifth verse of ""If This World Were Mine"" is missing. The verse goes:Oh, baby, you're my inspirationAnd there's no hesitationWhen you want meHoney, just call me, ohSince the song is 4:00 the verse was simply cut. LOL, now I understand why the album is titled ""The Essential Luther Vandross"" and not the ""Complete Luther Vandross""."
2,A Waste Of Time For Serious Fans!,"Wow, another attempt by Sony to repackage Luther's many hits, which serious fans already own on original CDs & probably a boatload of other repetitive compilations. Sony continues to pimp Luther, and this 2 CD set was released the same day as 'Dance With My Father', which is a must have. Also, am I mistaken or did Sony mess up again by NOT INCLUDING the BIG hit 'Bad Boy / Having A Party' on this set ?? What are they smoking over there...LOL??? That should tell you something right there!! The only way to have a perfect Luther Vandross compilation CD is to make it yourself, and personally, I created the Ultimate Luther Collection (1980-2003), which is 3 CDs & covers his entire solo career. Since Luther has passed on, I can bet that Sony will try this mess again, but SERIOUS fans are urged to do the job RIGHT..unlike Sony!When all is said & done, this 'Essential Luther Vandross' set isn't essential at all!!..."
2,Pavia should have called it a novel,"Peter Pavia fails as a non-fiction writer. He should stick to novels. The book is full of fabrications and fiction-all could have been verified with a little better research. He depends too much on the memory of a few ""insiders""; Pavia was just mostly misinformed. The best part of the book is the Epilogue, but that could have been a magazine article."
1,WORST FIGHTING GAME EVER!,"THIS GAME IS JUST PLANE BORING! THE COMBO SYSTEM IS WEAK, THE CHARACTORS ARE POORLY ANIMATED, AND THE GRAPHICS ARE JUST GOD AWFUL! AVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE PLAGUE! TRUST ME! I'M DOING YOU A FAVOR."
1,mr. kool,was not what i wanted not the same color i had to keep it cuz it came out a yellow ugly color. not kool
1,Horrible,"I thought I would save some money and purchase a cheap tire. Never bought a wirebead tire but after spending so much money for all my triathlon gear, i thought I could buy a cheap training tire. First, the tire had to stretch out before I can fully inflate my tube but I learned that the hard way because it blew a tube when it reached 90 psi. I then inflated the tube to 80 psi so that the tire can stretch out. After the new day, I inflated it to 100 psi and rode on it for 5 minutes. When I left the bike, the tube pooped again. Checked the rim for any spokes and there weren't any issues. Bought a more expensive tire and didn't have any problems. Bottom line: not worth the savings. You get what you pay for."
3,Not bad for the price,"I settled on a pair of these tires because it's not easy finding 700c gumwalls. I figured for the price I didn't have much to loose. I commute 5 days a week so I put a lot of miles on them in a short period of time. They held up fine for two months before nicks in the tread resulted in a number of flats over a two-week period. They'd lasted about 1500 miles and served their purpose. Short life, but you always get what you pay for."
2,Why I didn't buy the book,"I paged through this for quite some time at Micro Center, but decided not to get it for the following reasons: 1) Many interesting portions of the kernel are completely missing and not discussed (e.g. device drivers, architecture section networking)2) The majority of the book is a printout, and it didn't even disclose what version of the kernel it was on3) The commentary isn't grouped as I think it should be"
1,Save your money!,"I just got my copy of Core Kernel Commentary ... and was I ripped off or what! I just paid to get a bound copy of the Kernel source code!Yes, I am serious. 414 pages out of 561 are just a printout of the kernel source code (minus the service modules) with line numbers. I just paid for a 150-page book. Colour me unimpressed.I've only peeked at the remaining 150 pages; the architecture diagrams are pretty much verbatim from the free LHG and the 'annotations' are little one-paragraph restatements of the comments with the odd tidbit here and there, but unless you plan to read it cover to cover, there is no clear organization to the information. Even the CD is useless, it's just 5 editions of the kernel sources with TAG files (jump to a line number given a source code token) ... even if the CD just had the sources with hyperlinks to these 'annotations' it might be mildly useful.This one is going back."
1,Not what you want,"This is probably the book that you don't want, if what you want is to know about the internals of Linux, this book is not the accurate for it, first of all, in Amazon.com you see that they say that the book is like 500 pages long, well, that's true, only that almost 400 pages are code, and not new code, all code, corresponding to the 2.2.14 kernel, and the latest stable release of the kernel is is 2.4.8.All the information that you need about the linux kernel can be easy obteined reading freely available information on the Internet,...Anyway, if you really want to learn about the linux kernel buying this book is not going to get you one step closer."
3,Interesting for ones own education,"I've found this book somewhat usefull. It does a firly good job of explaining the various features and services available inside the linux kernel. The source code is used as an aid to explinations of services, but is incomplete, and so is somewhat lacking as complete reference."
2,2 stars because i don't use it much,"i bought this book with ambitions of teaching myself linux internals or being able to read the print version of the source for reference. if find myself frequenting online groups and threads for more and better answers than the book provides. also the kernel is older than the current 2.4x. in particular i was looking for CIFS vfs stuff which wasn't in this at all (but is in 2.4x).so two stars because i haven't been able to use it much. others may find it more relevant in their ""core"" areas."
2,Gas Grill Plasic Knob,Product markings showing OFF to low does not line up with grill due to prong misligning on inside of knob.
3,medical-like,"though many people find second angel as having so many footnotes, which is true, for me, i find it helpful. it didnt distract me at all. it nevertheless gave me the break my eyes needs. its full of medical notes and process which i understand because i am in this field. very unique and scientific."
2,Nice ideas let down by flat writing,"Biotech, like most thriller subjects, can get awfully dull when the writing isn't stylish, clever or imaginitive. And here, it isn't. Consequently the whole thing becomes very hard work. Also, the quasi-science fiction feel of this book lessens its impact. Something happening TODAY or, at least, tomorrow, would have been more engaging. But then, I guess truly contemporary subjects that haven't been worked to death are very hard to come by."
2,Too Many Words Too Many Digressions,"The book's editor and publisher failed badly in not cutting this one done. A short story at best if the filler was removed. The author was allowed to play ""Mr. Science"" going off on tangents explaining what entropy is etc. This distracted greatly from the (short) story. I was also very annoying. I can get better explanations of scientific phenomenon from a physics book if I want it."
5,Different,"This book is half way between a sci-fi movie and a comic book. And a mixture of a thriller and science fiction. It is not for those people that need everything to be precise and consistent in a book. But if you admit the inconsistent bits and pieces, you will turn page after page."
1,"Dense, Boring, Technical","I couldn't get past the second chapter. After paragraph long sci-tech footnotes on practically every other page and then an entire section on 'history' of this future world which boiled down to an 'article' on blood, I gave up. Nothing had compelled me or interested me in the least."
1,Dreadful with a Capital D,"I picked up this book after hearing a glowing review on Terry Gross's Fresh Air radio show. Big mistake. The reviewer called the book science fiction for people who don't like science fiction. A more accurate description is this: The Second Angel is science fiction for people who like cardboard characters, hackneyed plots, and wooden dialog covered with a veneer of literary pretension.I rarely drop a book in the middle, but made an exception for this one. Perhaps the last half is far better than the first. I wouldn't bet on it."
1,Tedious Read,"Having been a fan of Kerr's previous novels, I was left disappointed with this one. I didn't care about any of the characters, in fact, I couldn't remember who was whom when I'd leave the book overnight and picked it up again the next day! The lack of emotion of the main character after losing his wife and child were just plain not believable. No grief, nothing, just plain indifference. I found the author's research explaining just about every new technical or futuristic twist too tedious to read...too much blah blah blah after a while. If you're interested in this type of sci-fi, try out James Halperin's ""The First Immortal"", you'll get far more punch for your money."
2,What a disappointment!,"""The thriller of the future""as it is labeled describes the human race in 2069: the majority of the population is infected with P2-virus, making clean blood the most wanted commodity on earth and on the moon. Moon is where the largest blood bank is located and its designer, Dallas, wants to break into it as a revenge after his employer has killed his wife and child.Philip Kerr has written some wonderful novels (the Berlin Noir trilogy), but this book is definitely a disappointment. The idea in itself is not bad at all, but the action in the book is rather slow (which is killing for a thriller), with lots of technical footnotes describing the situation in the future, some semi-philosophical ranting and the end holds a very unsatisfying twist. A missed chance."
1,inept,"The main character is, in turns, brilliant and idiotic. He designs security systems to protect the world's blood banks and, in the course of work, has to think like a criminal. It's easy to imagine this activity would make a person a bit paranoid. At least aware that not everyone is beneficent. Yet, when it comes to the threat on his own life, he's completely trusting. Add to this the incredible coincidence that this very important person's daughter is struck with an astoundingly rare genetic disorder and you have the making of a forced story. Surround these innocents with two dimensional bad guys, good guys, toss in dense foot notes and tedious exposition, the result is an uncreative stack of paper. Another thing, the editor was sound asleep, redundancy abounds throughout."
2,A Transfusion might help pep this up!,"After reading a good review in one of the weekly magazines, i purchased this book. As the other reviews comment, the book is thinly drawn, tedious to read (with repeated footnotes which interrupt the flow), as well as a second parallel discussion coming from the ""author"". While some of the scientific material is quite interesting and appears to be accurate, it should have been incorporated into the main story instead of the interminable footnotes. While the basic plot story has been summarized in previous reviews, it is an original idea and perhaps will become a movie. Because that is all this really is, a screenplay or plot outline. Finally, if someone who has read this volume could please e-mail me with an explanation of the ending, i would sincerely appreciate it. thanx. ddben@aol.com.p.s. try Tom Wolfe's new book instead!"
2,"Gruesome, I want my money back.","I saw the Amazon 2 star rating, but had heard a reveiw on NPR that made it sound interesting. I fell victim and bought the book. Why doesn't the author just call the main character Bruce Willis and get it over with. The movie can only be better. This book never delivers on any level. For the pure escapist the violence and sex fall WAY short. For the imagination just go to sleep and whatever you dream is sure to beat this. I'm sure that my nine year old nephew will love it, and want to buy the life like plastic action characters."
2,Disappointing.,The book was full of great concepts and scientific facts but short on plot and characterization. Never cared about the characters and never raised my pulse.
2,This book flat s*cks,"Characters I couldn't give a rats behind about, a lame, empty story, and a verbal show off for an author, amount to one poor read. I made the fatal mistake of reading this book because I read a review on it that sounded good. Bad mistake. It read like a bad made for t.v. movie. Don't bother tuning in to this one."
2,A very disappointing story,"There are some interesting plot elements here, but not nearly enough to make this a good story. The characters are all stereotypes, and rather uninteresting and unattractive ones at that. The plot is implausible and full of inconsistencies. Most of all, the narrator - and one assumes therefore the author - is pretentious throughout."
2,Confused,I've finished reading this book and found it to be very well written. Kerr is very techical in his writing as to how the story all fits together. The plot was very believable because if mankind is not careful the gap between the haves and the have the nots will widen. Blood being the commodity. What I found that was disappointing was the end. Kerr built you up during the story but suddenly let you down with the eneding. I guess Kerr is planning to write a sequel to this book.
2,"Not bad, until I got to the end","My husband, who is a real science-fiction buff, explained to me that the purpose of all of those awful footnotes was to lend credibility for the real science-fiction lovers who need the ""science"" in order to believe the plot. OK, I'm not one of those, was bored by the interruptions of the footnotes, but I can accept that and skim them. The problem is that the two twists at the end (why Cavor was so important to the plan and who the narrator is) were totally ludicrous and WITHOUT the explanatory footnotes that tried so copiously to explain all of the other potentially unbelievable futuristic developments. For an author to try so hard through the footnotes to make the book believable, he failed in the end with his two most important plot points."
2,on a rollercoaster,"Reading this book was like riding on a rollercoaster. In fact, picture a bell-shaped curve. My interest paralleled his writing, i.e., very little at first, increasing a lot towards the middle of the book, and then really waning towards the end. The only reason I even finished this book was because I was about 3/4 finished when I felt that I was wasting my time. ..."
1,How to put sex in blood disease,The book is poorly written and is boring.It uses sex gratuitously to I guess try to justify writing it.It is overpriced. I would reccomend that you not buy this book or anything else by this author.I intend to take it down to the used book exchange and get it out of my home.I should have read more of the reviews when I ordered it. Certainly the one written for sold by Amazon does not reveal its sexual nature.
2,Glad I got it cheap.,"Bought this book several years ago from a book store for 3 bucks. Started reading it and put it down. Picked it back up a few days ago and couldn't remember why I put it down. Poorly written, poorly executed. I finished it just because I hate leaving books unfinished. Now I wish I would've just put it down. Very few interesting parts, and the ending was very disappointing."
2,Interesting if blood is your way of life ....,Started out as a really interesting story - but I soon got bogged sown in copious footnotes on almost every other page...
2,"Liked the cover, hated the book","Any story that needs heaps of footnotes to explain what's going on needs radical surgery. I can't help thinking Kerr included them in a specious attempt to lend his 'vision' of the future intellectual weight. If so, it fails. This is fiction, after all, and fiction has to work by persuading and involving readers in the story, not by bashing them over the head with didactic paragraphs of small print. It might all be justified if Kerr actually backed up his vision of the future. How did the world get into this awful state? And why should it turn out this way? His suggestions on these matters are unconvincing to say the least. All in all, neither intellectually stimulating nor much fun."
1,Like Footnotes?,"Philip Kerr is a poor man's Crighton. In fact, Kerr couldn't carry Crighton's literary jock or anyone's literary jock for that matter. The man mistakes footnotes for fiction. Add in a tinker toy plot revolving around a dumb assassin, a framed hero, and you have another book that Kerr probably wrote in one day. How does this guy keep on publishing books? He makes Bret Easton Ellis look like Shakespeare. Thumbs down on Second Angel."
2,An average thriller,"As with other reviewers, I found the lack of character development a disappointment. The footnotes and italicized asides really made for a distracting read. This should not be the goal of any author. It had lots of promise with it's intriquing plot line, but it doesn't work in Kerr's framework. He should study the works of Caleb Carr (The Alienist) or John Case (The Genesis Code)."
5,Exciting Science Fiction Thriller!,"Honestly, I did not know what to expect when someone on the SF-Lit internet group recommended this book. I was unaware of Phillip Kerr. What we have here is an engrossing, tightly plotted science fictional thriller. It is set in a future society where blood is a cherished and valuable resource. Kerr must be aplauded for his depth of characterization, swiftly moving plot and science. No, it wasn't boring, I have read alot of science fiction over the years and this ranks as one of the best I have read. I was really sad when the book ended because I left the world that Kerr had created for me. I hope he continues to write science fiction. The book was not marketed as science fiction but surely was. One of the most engrossing and engaging books that I have ever read."
5,great sci fi book,"This is a wonderfully writen book with great charactor devolopment.It is about an all too plausable future in which mans arrogance in tampering with nature to sute his needs leads to the creation of a deadly but curable virus called P2.Unfortuniataly only the rich and healthy people can afford the cure.I won't say more so I don't give the plot away,but if you like a fast paced well written story with enough hard science thrown in to make the scenerio tantilizingly possible then the second angle is a must read."
5,not only sci-fi thriller...,"The Second Angel is one of the best books i have ever read. It combined an interesting and creative story with SO much information. I'm not a big fiction fan, and i thought it would be boring and unrealistic, but it was VERY interesting. This book is the only fiction book i've ever read with footnotes! He puts so much information into it, from the hierarchy of angels to how blood works to Descartes' ontological argument for the existence of God! I loved it, and if you like to learn and be entertained at the same time, you will too!"
2,Not nearly Crichtonesque . . . .,"This Briton who's been called ""Michael Crichton's Smarter Brother"" disappointed me for the last time. Of the three novels I've read by him, the only book worthy of comparison was ""The Grid."" ""Esau"" was disappointing and so was this one. There is ""food for thought,"" as in his earlier works, but it wasn't integrated into the book in a fluid, seamless manner. Mr. Kerr has quite a ways to go before being inducted into the pantheon of literary greatness."
4,The history of bestiality,"Somewhere in this book Bjorneboe wrote: ""Within 10 years my knowledge of the world will be so big that it must lead to self-destruction."" Exactly 10 years later, he committed suicide. A remarkable fact that shows which atmosphere this novel breathes. It is a semi-autobiographical story about absolute freedom and absolute loneliness - two sides of one coin. About depression, about 20th century Europe and about the bestiality of mankind. Despite its pitch-black vision on humanity, it is also a very funny book. A masterpiece in irony and cynism!"
1,cAN u say horrible?,this dvd is so increrdibly dumb. It's to dumb for words. Absolutely do NOT recommend it!
5,Amazing!!,"Cheikh Anta Diop is amazing. I have read ALL his books, and as always, this one is excellent. In ""Pre-Colonial Black Africa"", (unlike all his other books) he takes a small step out of Ancient Egypt and explores more of his own home region (West Africa). His work is prolific and clearly exposes the fact that West African history can be accurately traced thousands of years, thanks to all the myriad historical texts already at our disposal (""Tarikh-as-Sudan"", ""Tarikh-as-Fettash"", etc).Senegal should be extremely proud of producing such a quality scholar like Diop! I would like to see his works translated to other languages (African, especially). It is important that Africans read their history from an objective (and native!) viewpoint. I would give the book more than 5 stars if it was possible. I have to add that it's a lot easier to comprehend and appreciate for an African-born/raised person. Diop (as always) shined on this one!"
4,www.sportofdistraction.com,"Some of Cheikh Anta Diop's findings prove to be controversial to some who choose to look at the issue through biased lenses. The information presented within this book is capitivating for anyone interested in learning more of the Africa that existed prior to and during the early stages of Black Afica.The frustrating aspect is that more can not be known, or researched due to the loss of artifacts & oral history. Looking into ""Precolonial..."" definitely cracks the window open for all parties interested in understanding, or being exposed to, this rich history."
5,get the whole story,"In the words of John Henrik Clarke, ""what we know as Black History, are actually the missing pages of World History.."" Anyone who is a true student of history can easily see the motivation, methodology, and justification of non-Africans in suppressing the whole truth. Cheikh Anta Diop is nothing less than a hero. His work continues to baffle the eurocentric ideology, which is already crumbling under its own weight."
5,Master teacher,"This is by far, the authentic history of Afrikan people by a master teacher. This should be recommended reading for all across the world in secondary and at college level."
1,More Distortions.,"Why do authors like these feel the need to distort history? No serious, objective scholar accepts their views. They make more than what was in sub-Saharan African history and indeed seem to make up fairy tales out of whole cloth. This isn't history, this is political diatribe - bilious, vile and full of barely supressed hatred. And half-truths and lies. Authors like these do no one a service and do a great disservice, particularly to the african american community. Where are they true scholars? Where are their voices raised against these gigantic leaps of logic and truth strectching? Where are they on the out right lies? Cowering from the label of racism, if non-black and the even more damaging label of 'Uncle Tom' if blacks. Sad. So very sad."
3,this game is ok,"The game casper is an ok game. It is not the best game sega has come out with, but it is alright. The game features none other than capser the friendly ghost. This game is great for all ages, it entertains ages from young children ranging to full grown adults. For a good game with a good price i recommend purchasing this game."
4,DOD FX22 VIBROTHANG REVIEW,"This is what I call a poor man's or working man's UNIVIBE... I got this only because this was affordable and did the SAME job as the UNIVIBE AND SOUL VIBE. I have had it for 4 years and only used it 2x, so that is why I did not want to spend a lot of money and at the rate Zoom, Digitech and others are improving their effects... this was just good for my needs.This metal pedal unit also gives a tremolo effect when you tweak the knobs as well as a vibrato with a slight auto wah type sound so you can get 3 pedals in one here. There are video clips on youtube for this pedal and you will have to sample it to really get the settings and sound you are looking for the video on youtube was clearly too short and did not emphasize the full potential of the pedal.I rate this pedal a 4 out of 5 for effects quality, built and price. I used this with my Yamaha keyboard and guitars when I want to do Jamiroquai stuff ie. Return of the spacecowboy."
4,Good leather care for car seats,I ordered the kit after seeing the name on one of the car forums. I've used it only once but seems to be doing a good job. It comes with a cleaner concentrate which needs to be mixed with warm water to be used. Very efficient in cleaning the premium leather car seats. I then used the leather conditioner which gave a level of moisturization to the surface (possibly very much required after the cleaning) and made it soft.The added pad and towel - hmm! I didn't actually need them - I've a stack of microfiber towels at home - but it kind of handy. The kit was almost same price if I had ordered the cleaner and the conditioner separately.
1,baby whale costume,"This is an adorable costume however its not 6-12 months, its a 12 months.waaaay to big for my small 5 month old. oh well will have to return"
3,"Expurgated, outdated, but a good school text","Bolchazzy-Carducci, doyens of the cheap knock-off editions of out-of-copywright Classical texts, have resurrected C.S. Jerram's 19th century public-school edition of the Vera Historia and stuffed it with whimsical, if unnecessary, line drawings. The passage where the vine-women turn the crew's members to wood is excised, and, sadly, the Traveler's account of the sexual/reproductive habits of the male-only Moon-men is deleted, although happily it's added to an appendix. Once the ornate introduction is past, the Atticized Greek is pellucid and easy, and the story itself is a continual delight. The hero sails his ship to the Moon, fights in the war between the Moon-men and the forces of the Sun (including centaurs from Sirius!)visits the Frozen Sea and the Island of Cheese, and is accidentally swallowed by a whale. Second-year Greek students might enjoy this more than, say, the Anabasis, although it's admittedly a marginal work."
4,nice,this game is crazy tight. its off the chain fo real. u know u can throw down on this urryday. everything about it is good except it is on sega saturn which is a little old but still mad sick.
1,Ridiculous Price,"Are the Mythbusters on crack? I really like the show, and have some of their collections, which are quite nice and reasonably priced. But charging $22 for a 42 minute episode is ridiculous.Rating is for the price, not the content, which is pretty funny."
4,Great little book,The size of this book is the best thing about it. You can get all the info in other books but they are big and heavy to carry around at lure shows or just out looking at garage sales. It has very good pictures and accurate info.
4,Excellent MySQL referance but it needed more Perl Examples,"This book got me off the ground in a hurry with MySQL, but could have used more examples of how to use MySQL with Perl. Still, it is a must have for the library."
1,disappointing,"Very disappointing. O'Reilly books generally mean quality but this one is terrible. It's poorly organized and the idea of covering both MySQL and mSQL in the same book simply doesn't work. Most people will be using one or the other and will be flipping back and forth trying to find the relevant chapters. What information there is is not particularly useful or insightful, consisting mostly of technical references which are done much better on the MySQL site. Not recommended.Instead of this book, I would go with:The Practical SQL handbook- for general learning about SQLMySQL by Paul DuBoisand depending on whether you plan to use PHP or Perl:MySQL and Perl for the Web by Paul DuBoisPHP and MySQL Web Development by Luke Welling and Laura Thomson"
2,Too broad -- not enough detail,"Trusting in the O'Reilly standard of books does not help here.The main problem with the book is that it covers two differentdatabases. Unless you are planning on using both mSQL and mySQL,this book will not cover in enough detail the single database you plan to use.I would recommend buying a different book which focuses completely on either database.On the positve size, the book does provide material on howto access from Perl, PHP, Java, C/C++, and Python. Again thoughthe material suffers since it tries to cover both APIs."
1,Don't waste your money,This book has more errors in it than any technical book I've ever bought. There was obviously no one knowledgable about the subject editing or reviewing the contents before publication. Publishing under the O'Reilly name is NOT a guarantee of quality anymore!
2,Very disappointed.,"I was very disappointed with this book. So were two coworkers who have looked at it. This book is not up to the traditional O'Reilly quality. (In fact, I'm annoyed enough to say that Que should have published this book...)Only about 30% of the book is useful material. Most examples and explanations are sketchy -- almost useless. If you already knew SQL, there's very little to learn from this book. If you didn't know SQL, this book does a poor job of teaching it to you.If the book stuck strictly to mSQL and MySQL, it would have been about ~150 pages of content. The rest (about 300 pages) is a ""reference manual"" for various (PHP/Perl/Java JDBC/C/Python) languages' support for MySQL/mSQL. Again, if you didn't know the concepts already, you would have a hard time learning useful stuff from this book.Still, I have to admit to using the book every so often as a handy ""at-my-fingertips"" reference book. For that, I am glad that I have it. But I don't think it was worth the price I paid."
1,This book is a good argument for book burning,"What were the editors at O'Reilly thinking when they let this book make it into publication? For a company that has such a good reputation, you'd think they would guard it by keeping to the high standards that earned it.This book has absolutely nothing useful in it. It's not an in depth SQL book. It's not an in depth MySQL book. It's not an in depth mSQL book. It's not even close to a decent reference book (just listing function names does not make a reference). It's so poorly written that it doesn't even differentiate cleanly between mSQL and MySQL!I think the cover animal should have been a dung beetle!"
2,"Yes, this book *is* as poor as others are saying...","To start, mixing mySQL & mSQL into one book is not a good idea, and this implementation brought out the worst. It was often difficult to tell which the author was presently discussing. Secondly, a reader new to SQL would be very lost reading this book. It often gets lost in verbose treatment of details and delivers disappointingly little useful info. The most potentially useful chapter, #10, offers a sample application in Perl. However, the application is so obscure and the explanation is so poor that the example is not useful. O'Reilly books used to uphold a high standard but have been slipping fast in the last couple years. This work and others makes me seriouly question relying on the cover to assume adequate quality."
1,Sketchy and incomplete,"Two thumbs down on this one. The treatment of MySQL and mSQL together is especially confusing. Examples leave much to be desired. The reference section is okay, but not as complete as online documentation. Save your money on this one and buy Paul Dubois' ""MySQL"" instead."
2,You get what you pay for.,"This book was a huge disappointment to me. It was one of the softest watered down computer texts i've ever seen. My only question is where's the ""Que"" book when you need it?"
1,Horrible!!,"This certainly the worst book on computers that I've ever seen. O'Reilly, do something about this NOW!!"
2,"All things to all developers, Nothing to Nobody...","Before I start in with the thrashing, I would recomend this book to people who have NEVER done database development or administration. If you really haven't worked with databases this might be a nice, gentle intro. Otherwise, let the games begin.This book was a let down. It tried too hard to be all things to all people and ended up being nothing to nobody... The last 200+ pages of the book were a nice reference but that's about it. The begining of the book provided a nice history lesson and some background, but that information isn't that critical.If you are into Perl I would go through the MySQL tutorial that is part of the documentationIf you develop in Python, Java, C++, PHP or some other language with a API for MySQL, maybe this is the best info available. I hope thats not the case.Better Luck Next Time..."
1,Garbage,Does not even make a good bookend. Check out MySQL by Paul Dubois or the online docs. A good replacement.
3,Better Than I Thought,"Since there are very few books on MySql, I settled for this one. I was surprised how much it helped. It needs to be more in depth, but it is helpful."
1,Worst Book from O'Reill,"This is the worst O'Reilly book ever. It made me not use MySQL for over a year. I switched to PostgreSQL instead. No step by step on how to add users, etc. I did think the Perl-DBI/DBD part was good, but it was useless because of the early chapters.I'm not saying the book was dog, but it does chase cars and eat kibble."
2,No Meat,"I was looking for a book on MySQL and, with this purchase, ended up with a book on database design instruction and brief overviews on the different methods of interacting with the MySQL rather than a book about MySQL itself. Good book on database design, but not a quality reference to MySQL. Keep looking...also expected more from O'Reilly"
1,Don't waste your money on this book!!!,"I bought this book because of the high ratings of the early reviews here. Now, I can not agree more with those people who told the truth about this book in those recent reviews. This book needs a focus on Mysql. And, it does not have references to some important functions such as 'die()' and 'printf()' in PHP, so you cann't say it is comprehensive, either. After all, this is a disappointing effort by O'reilly."
1,It is NOT focused on using MySQL,"This book covers everything revolving around MySQL except the engine itself and its supporting programs. It really should have stuck to documenting, in detail, how to use mysql, mysqladmin, mysqlaccess and how to use the APIs. Most everything was either a straight copy of the program help output or the MySQL documentation. It provided almost zero insights on using MySQL specifically. I understand more about the theory of MySQL permissions after reading this book, but I did not learn how to modify those permissions. They also completely missed an important point about auto-incrementing fields that I learned the hard way playing with MySQL. You are better off just reading the online documentation than buying this book. It's simply a waste of money."
2,"Fair reference to start with, but leaves you wanting more","The books was my first introduction to MySQL ( I never read anything about mSQL out of choice) and I felt it started of well, but as I got further the book lacked depth both in examples and content. The second half is more like a reference manual probably good for someone with prior knowledge. I guess O'relliy could do better having more detailed examples and an online reference code / cd with ready examples from the book."
3,"Brief and good, but other book may be better.....","This book gives most of the commands and functions. However, the other much discussed one : MySQL (OTHER NEW RIDERS) may be better, not because it has more pages but its depth. It does not have any CD rom with examples which could be nice."
3,good companion book,"This book is not a complete guide to MySQL/mSQL. Like all computer books, it doesn't cover everything you need to know, you need some other reference. However, if you combine this book and the reference manual on mysql web site. It will get you going. Beside, designing a database is more than just know the command and syntax, there is a lot of theories behind it. Use this book as a companion to the reference and some other database design books, you can pretty create a big db system."
3,not good but not bad neither,Chapter 2 in this book is pretty good. It takes about database modelling and normalization stuff. The last 1/2 of the book is a good quick ref. Chapter 3 and 4 are the waste on installing mSql and Mysql because all softwares come with a manual and a readme. One thing I learned from this book is the concept of database and on joining tables.
3,Not for the novice...,"Well, this is a good book in my opinion, despite what the other reviewers may say. There are a few caveats... the examples, while ""good"", are filled with errors, which can be confusing to people who are complete beginners, and don't know better than to realize whomever reviewed this book, was blind. The online MySQL handbook is also quite good, and this is a decent companion to it."
2,It was over soon after I started reading it,"I am new to DBs and programming. I was shocked to hit the ""Reference"" section on page 230-ish of a 430-ish book! What I needed was many concrete examples of Mysql practicalities, db and dba design under Mysql. Sure it is nice to have the extra references, but probably the book focused on the auxiliary topics too much. sorry O'Reilly, you're still awesome, i'm just a dummy who needs examples and breakdowns of examples. thanks."
1,"If you are looking for MySQL, keep looking.","Almost 500 pages about database concepts, SQL, history, definitions, etc, but not much on how to actually use MySQL."
5,Perfect companion to MySQL,"This book is a perfect reference companion for MySQL, in many ways building on the current manual, and providing extensive, well designed reference sections."
1,this book stinks!,"I've never had a bad experience with an OReilly book before, but I did with this one. The book consists mostly of general information related to databases and the material on Mysql/msql is only slightly, if that, better than the material found on the unix man pages."
1,incomplete. unhelpful,"This book is NOT written to help its reader to understand and use either MySQL or mSQL. It is very sketchy and short on explanations. The worse part of the book is where George Reese, the Zarathustra wanna-be starts his semi-philosophical ramblings which has nothing to do with the book title. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,One good chapter,"It's hard to decide how many stars to give this book -- overall the book is a disappoinment, but there is one chapter on database design that really makes the book worthwhile. Chapter 2 gives an excellent introduction to the normalization process involved in creating a good relational database design, and it's something every database person, especially beginners, should read. It's all theory that can be applied to any relational database, not just mySQL or mSQL.Unfortunately the rest of the book is disconnected, out-of-date, and generally a waste of trees. I don't mean to sound harsh, but I was disappointed to see such a book come from O'Reilly. You would be better off with the DuBois MySQL book, or one of the many books that cover MySQL and PHP."
2,Not up to O'rielly Standard,"After purchasing several O'Rielly books, I had a good expectation on this one. I was simply dissatisfied using this book. Most of the CGI interfaces did not work for me (until I brushed them up) and the book is not very well organized. My partner had the same comment on this. Does not provide a clear picture of mSQL and MySQL databases, In fact I found some web site tutorials more useful. Although this book has some material in it, it should be reviewed carefully to present them in a better way."
2,this book is weak,"Wether you're experienced with web databases or not, (and everyone who uses one of these open-source databases is using it for web) this book is a disappointment. A large amount of the content is filler, which would be much better filled with a general overview of relational databases and SQL structure, which is really badly represented. For instance: the book will tell you how to implement joining and indexing with SQL language, but it won't tell what that's for anywhere. As for an experienced web db builder (which I am now,) the book is an incomplete reference of the SQL language and db admin tasks, such as performance, backups, etc."
2,This book is all math,"This book is for the very serious student - only. It is all math, and more math. There are no circuits, block diagrams, or any practical implementations shown. All theory. Not what I was looking for."
5,A great thing!,"I use this appliance for closed-captions only, and I must say it's a great thing: if English is not you mother-language and you are not accustomed to all the nuances of American or British accents - this is the device that adds another dimentions to watching you dvd's.It's pity that closed-captions are mandatory only in the US, and not in UK, but anyway it's 3/4-filled glass.The device is easy to connect (RCA plug), easy to configure and it remembers the setting, so, honestly, one uses the remote control just once."
3,Enigmatic,"Like Pinto's first novel this is a difficult book to review. After the first I was a little reluctant to embark on this one but am glad that I did (I think). I see the glowing reviews from some for Pinto's work and I am perplexed, for Pinto is a good even excellent writer but a poor novelist. Pinto is ambitious but spends too much effort on the decoration at the expense of the foundations. The characterisation is good although not always consistent, the world building is interesting and detailed but the plot is terrible. This was exactly the problem with the first book. At the end it is a frustrating and unsatisfying read. Pinto obviously has great promise but is desperately in need of a coauthor who can do plot and an editor who does their job and sort out plot inconsistencies. Whoever was on the job at Tor needs a good kick in the pants although they did a better job than book 1."
3,Toner Good,Good Toner. Toner Cart good. It works. What else do you want? Hardly deserves a gold medal. It works in your Samsung. Give it three starts for being what it's supposed to be.
2,Not thorough enough!,"I expected more from Wayne Wescott, Ph.D., who is often quoted by fitness magazines. His name is well-known in the area of health and fitness research. The book did not address sodium intake or give any recommendations for daily fat intake. Caffeine was also not addressed. It seems like these areas would be covered to some extent, given the book is about reducing cellulite. The weight-training program did not advocate changing one's routine every 6 or 8 weeks to avoid plateaus. I was excited to buy this book, but very disappointed at the lack of thoroughness on the part of the authors. It just didn't seem to cover everything it should have, leaving this reader with many unanswered questions."
2,"Fan of Wayne Westcott, not a fan of this book.","I have the utmost of respect for Wayne Westcott, but this book was beneath his standards in terms of the exercises selected for the most effective weight training for this type of weight loss (by way of muscle gain). In all of my reading, and in all of my experience personally and as a certified personal trainer, I do not see that the use of machines gives you either the best results for building lean muscle mass and/or burning calories (unless, of course, you have issues which warrant the use of machines). In my opinion, you'd be better off reading either or both of THE NEW RULES OF LIFTING books by Lou Schuler and Rachel Cosgrove's THE FEMALE BODY BREAKTHROUGH."
3,"Fun for our daughter, but have to ""fix"" it often","Our daughter loves to run around with this thing, but the extension of string on the handle got to be too much of a pain so we cut it shorter since we aren't doing tricks and we've had to knot the wooden ball on a few times to keep the handle attached. Overall a decent value but you get what you pay for. There's fun to be had if you don't mind making some modifications to the design yourself."
5,Wand,Lots of fun for the kids. The pull string that you hang onto is somewhat confusing and difficult for those that are really little (age 2)
3,nice but too long.,"i like the many colors, but they were to long for my 2yr old. she still had a great time playing with them"
5,Had one as a kid,My daughter loves dancing with this ribbon. Keeps her busy for hours! I would recommend for kids over 4 since ribbon is so long.
3,Fun for an older child (7+ years?),"I bought this for my 6 year old to play with. I liked the look and wasn't concerned about the ""stunt"" portion of it. After struggling with it we re-tied it to eliminate the stunt portion; now it's just a pretty ribbon on a stick. If you have an older child (I'm guessing 7 or 8 at least) and really want the stunt portion then this one's as good as any I saw, but you could probably buy a ribbon and tie it to a stick and have as good (or better a product) if you aren't concerned with the stunts."
3,Too complicated for younger kids,"Didn't realize that there is a 'control string' that the child needs to hold in their other hand in order to use the toy. A bit too difficult for a younger child to manage. Really just wanted a basic 'ribbon dancer' toy for our granddaughter to twirl around with. Should be fine when she's older, but for now, too hard for her to manage."
4,"Helpful to learn Portuguese, but more helpful for Portuguese speakers","I bought this book to learn more portuguese. That it certainlywill help you with! The book is filled with pictures that are'labelled' to teach you the names of various items and places andthings in everyday life. For example you get a scene of 'the body'all labelled up with hair, teeth, head etc. There are no 'lessons'like most other books -- it is a picture dictionary.My only complaint is that, as an English speaker going Portuguese,in some parts of the book it is assumed you ar Portuguese learningEnglish -- so some word are just plain left out (like telling time).The book could very easily have been aimed at both sides of the learningexperience with just a tiny bit more effort.This is not to say it is incomplete, as some 98% of everything translatesback and forth. Just a minor criticism."
2,This could have been a exceptional album...,"There is a lot of nice progressive guitar and keyboard work going on here. It's too bad this band chooses to use silly, irrating death vocals for the entire album, otherwise they really might have had something here. Musically this band is a 4 or even 5. I must say I can't stand the vocals... the person singing sounds like he's coughing, spitting, gargling, or in actuality anything but singing. I just can't believe a band this talented wouldn't do something to change this."
3,"Love chocolate, not shopping","If you don't mind shopping for Somersize sweetener, Somersize chocolate, Somersize white chocolate, etc. then this book would likely be a good one. I am sure that the recipes are good. I just didn't have the energy to get MORE ingredients for my pantry that I might or might not get around to using. Suzanne looks great, and her recipes from other books were quite good. I was looking for easy chocolate recipes that were low in sugar that I could actually eat. I think I'll just buy some Lara bars from my local grocer. Whew. Just thinking about shopping makes me tired, and I even like shopping at Amazon, but hate paying shipping - although many times that is free or less than the cost of gas to buy special ingredients from several different stores (as you are all well aware of). Still, if you don't mind the shopping, the recipes look like they would turn out well."
1,Understanding Health Policy,"Hated this book. Needed it for a class, boring book to me but maybe someone else can enjoy it. Would not have bought this unless I had to"
5,The best healthcare book!,"I m new to the healthcare insurance industry and I was looking for a book which would explain the complexities of the health care system from the basics. I bought many books but this is the only book which was perfect!It has great examples, visuals to explain every aspect of the healthcare system. Its a very simple read, and the chapters are really much shorter. The information has been organized very well as a result the readers information retention is much easier...:)I love this book!..."
4,Health Policy,New on the healthcare policy scene and was looking for a book that was easy to read and covered the basic fundamentals of this genre. This was that book. The case studies were up-to-date and relevant. Will be a great source to add to my reference library.
2,"Okay, but VERY biased","This book does a good job of explaining concepts and gives scenarios to help explain, and I really like that. It makes things very clear and easy to understand. With that said, it is one of THE MOST BIASED textbooks I have ever seen. Every now and then, the author throws in his own personal opinions (without stating ""this is my opinion). A textbook should be fact from BOTH sides of the political spectrum, not just one. There are parts where he definitely leaves out the otherside or does not fully address it. Because of this, I would not recommend this to be used, at least not by itself because it really is not complete and is very biased."
1,Should health care be a right?,"Beware: This is an highly ideological text that starts with the assumption that health care is a right! It than goes on to say that in order to fulfill that right it is necessary to control the costs of health care. Obviously, cost control is a very problematic economic proposition that calls for state intervention and that sometimes has consequences that are the opposite of what is desired.In the UK, where health care is a right, cost control has led to shortages, waiting lists and an overall degradation of health care. The UK, currently, has the highest mortality rates for oncological problems of all the EU countries and British people got used to flying to France and India for medical care. Canadians also have shortages and Canadians resort to the US.Sometimes a ""right"" can easily turn into a ""wrong""!"
1,Good Idea/Poorly Executed,"We bought one of these two years ago, and it has been trouble from the start.First, we had to ditch the bungie attachments and rig our own attachment to the headrests.Then, we realized that every few miles the zippers unzipped and rendered the whole thing useless until we rezippeded them.Finally (and predictably) the zippers broke entirely. We've resorted to duct tape, but that doesn't hold for long--we are now looking for a replacement, and we'll choose one without zippers this time."
2,A Disappointing Book,"The fact that the body remembers the psychological injuries inflicted on the mind is not new. What I found very disappointing and almost incredible is the fact that the author draws up a list of possible abuses and puts at the same level the trauma of a painful surgery and the emotional or/and sexual abuse of a child mistreated by her parents for years. The book is simplistic and first of all sends the wrong message to people who carries deep emotional wounds. It is close to the superficial self-help books that claim that they can solve your problems once and for all. This must be untrue given the huge number of books of this kind, all of them promising what they do not deliver. And the reader who needs serious help keeps buying the latest ""secret"" book that holds all the answers to your problems."
4,Walking the Tiger: Healing Trauma,Profound and moving description of effects of trauma. Clear explanation of guided somatic experiencing.
2,Less than impressed....,"As a psychologist with 20+ years experience, I am less than enamored with Peter Levine's work, and here's why:I realize lately that through many ""brief therapy"" approaches, both therapists and clients are looking for quick answers to rather complex problems. Those of us who have traditionally done longer term therapy already knew that it wasn't so easy. We also knew - or at least should know if we want to offer hope - that humans have an innate drive toward health, in spite of ""trauma."" When Levine points out the complexity of trauma, even as an em-bodied experience, he takes a ""radical"" approach - but really nothing new. Now many therapists and clients are ""discovering"" the baby that was thrown out with the bathwater. I give Levine credit for re-opening our eyes, but, frankly, this in not new material. Real growth producing therapy is a broad endeavor, not a six session ""technique""...."
4,"A good book ..., but bit too sure she is ""right"" for me.","This book has some marvelous ideas and if taken with a grain offers some real insights into healing. I have a bit of trouble with some of her certainty about her theories. I often have trouble with people who are sure their theories are ""right""; that is a bit of a personal issue. I would recomend this book for people who are struggling with their own healing of trauma AND those who want to help in the healing of trauma. Really. this book has some very good ideas. She doesn't bombard us with lots of words to get her meaning across. It is well written and easy to read. Just remember to keep your own reasoning and thinking cap on while you read it."
4,Interesting,Very interesting book about trauma. It forces you to look outside the box on our response to trauma. It explains why we react the way we do.I haven't finished reading it yet to be able to tell you if it helped.
3,Helpful if you have a problem with PTSD,This book was recommended to me by my therapist. It gave me insight into my past and some of my feelings and actions throughout my life. Not recommended for light reading..
1,animals ARE truamatized ~~~ and us women,"I haven't read this book, but after reading the assumption that animals aren't traumatized, i wouldn't. Animals ARE INDEED traumatized by life situations ... all a person needs to do is truly relate to animals to know this is true ... especially animals that are prey/food animals, like deer and horses, as opposed to predators, like wolves, lions, and tigers ..... and this is also the case with us women, who are the prey, as opposed to men, who are the predators."
5,Unbelieveable Results,"I am a bodyworker specializing in chronic pain. Many of my clients are sent to me by doctors because they are unable to work or are on restricted duties due to an accident in the workplace. A small percentage of them are pain free after a treatment only to find the pain returns within a matter of days.In these cases I have found that by using techniques of somatic experiencing there is almost invariably a dramatic, long term decrease in their pain. It is not the only answer, but for many it does provide an important part of the puzzle of chronic pain.I did learn some of these techniques from a student of Peter Levines prior to the release of the book and intend to follow Dr. Levines course shorty. I would recommend other bodyworkers consider the training in addition to reading the book."
4,waking the tiger,"Great book, best not to read it in one sitting as I found it ""woke my tigers"" all at once, which the book says can happen.I did seek help as book suggests.Well worth it all."
5,A framework for understanding trauma,"This is an excellent book for anyone who wants a mature view of what trauma is and how we heal from it. Peter Levine makes a compelling case that trauma is unique to the human species because our rational brains get in the way of the organism's instinctive physiological responses to life-threatening situations. In a case study near the end of the book, Levine clearly demonstrates his belief that re-exposure to traumatic circumstances as a way to heal must be gradual and at the organism's own pace. Cathartic experiences may be dramatic and lead us to believe we are helping, but in his view this approach risks deepening the traumatic symptoms. This is an excellent book, written in clear, non-clinical language that any non-professional can understand."
5,A must,"Very useful for both professionals and layman. Easy reading, full of great concepts illustrated by examples. Still up to date, after almost 2 decades."
5,"Excellent book, e version lacks footnotes!",This is a very good book on psychological trauma; however the ebook is missing the footnotes! Buyer beware! I've written to Amazon and have only received form letters.
5,A valuable handbook on stress management,"This is a very comprehensive review of stress management techniques for healing trauma. When combined with an active program of mindfulness meditation, then you will certainly have a winning combination. I use some of the same approaches when working with PTSD clients as a mindfulness-based psychotherapist. If you would like to learn more about mindfulness meditation to compliment this book then I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."
4,Easy to read and to understand,"The Reuters Financial Series allow almost every person with a simple knowledge of economy and mathematics to understand the stock market. It contains a lot of informaton and practical examples and the graphical look allow us an easy understanding of the topics. The only problem is the exercises and the examples are based on the ""Reuters Markets"" program, so if you dont't have it the book becomes a little useless."
3,Leaky,"My only complaint about these doors is that they leak like crazy in the rain. I realize they are fabric doors, but the fabric isn't leaking. Because of how thing the frame is, the doors flex a lot when closed and cannot create a good enough seal between them and the door frame. The result? Some pretty leaky doors. Leaky enough to make me put the stock doors back on when the weather is looking pretty good for rain. If you get these doors, make sure if the interior does get wet, you air it out as soon as possible, otherwise you run the risk of mold in your carpet and/or seats."
3,"Not great, but they work...","The passenger side door went out without a problem... the driver side, however, didn't go on well at all and had to be ""coaxed"" in to place. You also need to get mirror relocation brackets and put the mirrors just forward of the doors (on the Jeep). With the mirrors and doors on, the passenger side mirror is just about useless. The doors pull off easily and fit nicely in the back of the Jeep (especially if you have the backseat out like I do)."
4,My favorite snack,Costy.... I can't afford buying this all the time since I can go through this entire thing in like 1-3 days.It is an amazing salty snack comparable to chips...However... it is better if you buy these at an asian super-market. You can buy this for 5-8 dollars at a store...
3,:) thanks anyways,"i bought 2...it came just 1 but...they emailed me and wanted to resolve this saying they will send the other one, this people are very serious i like that :) i dont want the other one...its ok...the sheets were broken and gritty...the taste is fine but it doesnt matter if you can't not use it for sushi"
3,Mah Jong,It's okay. I would not have purchased it had the description of the item been better.Is is no help to me in playing the computer version of the game.
1,Poorly Designed Canon Case,"This Canon case is very poorly designed--for example, it does not even completely cover the Canon A-620 digital camera, one of the models for which it is expressly marketed by Canon. The case freely allows light, dust, air, and water in. You can clearly see the camera around the edge of the case even when the case is supposedly ""closed."" This case affords little protection."
3,does the job,"This case is not esthetically pleasing. A very unattractive grey. But it does the job more or less. It has a compartment for four batteries. The reason I only gave it 3 stars, is why not have a compartment for other things, a memory card and/or miscellaneous other stuff? The other major faux paux is why doesn't it give you the option to put it around your neck? Only on a belt buckle? It's very basic, no frills."
4,Nice look and inexpensive.,"This case is nice look and inexpensive if you can get a free shipping by buying some other item. One improvement can be done is to make front cover little bit longer. When I put four extra batteries in the front small packet, the front cover is looked little bit short."
2,Too small for A630 camera,Well made case but if you have the canon A630 camera or one of comparable size don't buy this case. It is frankly too small for the camera. If you stretch the flap it will close over the camera and attach to the velcro but just barely. Not sure I would trust carrying it by the belt loop either given the strain on the flap. There is no room for accessories such as extra cards without placing pressure on them due to tightness of case. This is so low priced not worth hassle of returning to Amazon but will buy an aftermarket case for my camera and consider this a lessoned learned. Canon should not sell this as fitting my camera.
1,cheap,It will work if you just need something to protect your camera. It is cheaply made and does not have a strap.
4,Clutch Camera Case,"I like this camera case. It fits my camera specifically. The only downside is that the little pocket for the extra memory chip is not very secure. I lost a chip, so I'd advise not using it. Otherwise it is a great camera case. Small & sleek & perfect for your Canon camera outings."
5,still have after 8 years,"works on my newer PowerShot - never had any problems with this little case, has traveled around the world with me a couple times"
1,The worst purchase I ever made.,Be aware of the shipping cost. Just wondering why Anazon is letting these kind of third party vendors inside their networ. My mistake I didn't notice the shipping cost initially.
4,Performs as Intended,"I bought this to be a camera case, and it does just that. It securely holds my Canon PowerShot A560 as well as a spare set of batteries. The velcro closure is high quality and I don't worry about anything falling out.I gave it only 4 stars because it doesn't really do anything that any other camera case doesn't do--but then, what else is a camera case supposed to do?"
4,Nice case. A Canon A560 fits perfect inside.,This is a good case. It has a front pocket for storing a memory card. No space left for extra batteries though.
4,Perfect fit,"Great product. I've had it for about a month now and the camera has been dropped twice while in the case and no damage at all. The only problem I have is the front pocket doesn't have a button or velcro to keep it closed, so anything in there can slide right out. I'd still recommend it for the Canon A series cause of the perfect fit."
4,sleek and nice,I use it for my Canon's A95 cam.. it fits well and also accommodates 4 AA batteries that my cam uses.. Its not bad at all.. keeps the cam safe.
3,Velcro doesn't last,"It's a great case for the intended cameras, but with use the Velcro on the flap loses its grip. For the price it should be better."
5,good case,"i cant say much about this case, except that it does what its supposed to do--to protect the camera.worth the price-good buy."
4,Nice case,Nice product. Fits the camera very well. Don't purchase if you are looking for a camera BAG. This case can only hold the camera and a memory card and that's about it. Good quality and function. Works well for my purposes.
3,Get the PSC-65 instead,"It's a case... What can you say? My A570IS fits just fine, though the case could be little smaller. It is supposed to fit the A7xx series as well, so not surprising that it is a bit big.The PSC-65 has a hole for the camera strap and also an internal pouch for a memory card. Everything else being equal, I recommend that case over this one."
2,STILL NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED.,This Canon PSC-60 Deluxe Case is just good to hold my newly-purchased Canon A560. I did not notice there is a shortcoming to this case until it happens. The front bag used for holding batteries is not tight enough. I have had my batteries fallen to the ground at least three times. Have to have this Camera case returned due to its poor design.
3,Great,"A good buy. In my opinion, eventhough it wasn't as great as the picture shows, it is still nice and fluffy."
3,A Bit Tight,"I have an averaged size digital camera (Canon PowerShot A630) and the camera barely fits - it is a snug fit which I guess is s good thing. Two things I dislike about the case. First, it has a belt strap only and no shoulder strap. Second, the accessory pouch can hold only a memory card. It's too small for batteries and who can travel without them? To solve these issues, I put the case in a fanny pack that allows for battery storage and a more useful strap. I would have sent the case back but it would have cost as much as the case did. It's disappointing when a vendor recommends one of its products with serious backs. (But I love the camera.)"
4,Canon Case PSC60,Very compact. Provides quick and simple access to the camera. Beware that the case does not provide complete protection to the camera from the elements.
4,"Good, but Missing One Feature I'd Like","I bought this case when I bought my Canon digital camera. I got the 570 IS, and the camera fits perfectly in the case. It's got a nice soft backing, so it will protect it from minor bumps and scraps. There's even a small pouch in front to hold an extra set of AA batteries or a memory card, although it wouldn't hold both. There is also a belt loop so you can carry your camera around your waist all day.However, I like to carry my camera on my wrist. This case has no hole for the wrist cord to go through, meaning if I have my camera on my write, I have to hold the case separately when I want to take a picture. That gets old in a hurry.I wish I had done more research before buying this case since it looks like the PSC-65 has that hole. On the whole, I'm happy with this case, but not as happy as I could have been."
4,great little case,"This is a nice case- I bought it for $.89 (yes, that does say 89 CENTS!) but shipping was $9. Was it worth it? Yes. It fits my A540 nicely. Protected it during my trip to Belize. It has a little pocket in the front that I can put 2 extra batteries in- nothing else will fit. It doesn't have a strap to carry it with but the camera strap can hang out for this purpose. It closes with velcro. Nice job."
5,Compact enough and Great price,This is a genuine Canon camera case just big enough to hold my Canon digital camera (a 2.5 inch screen). I like the fact that I can hold the camera on my wrist with the original camera strap coming out of the case. This cases sells for about $ 13 in Best Buy. I really cannot complain. It will be perfect if it will come with a shoulder strap so I can hang the camera around my neck. This is a better canon camera case then the regular size one. Highly recommended.
3,good product,"I bought it for Canon PowerShot A630. It works okay but it is a little too small for the camera. Other than that, it's good."
1,Cannon Camera Case,"I was very disappointed in this case. The camera fits in, but the only way to carry it is a belt-loop attachment. If it wasn't so much trouble I would have returned it."
2,Adequate,This camera case is designed only with a belt loop; it has no neck strap. The lack of the strap is a significant limitation the greatly reduces the usefulness of the product.Product construction is OK; fit and finish are OK; sizing for the A95 camera is perfect.
3,Perfect fit but lacks functionality,I bought this camera bag for my A510 camera. The camera fits in this bag perfectly. There is a web pouch in front of the bag.Well u can carry some spare SD cards in that one.But now a days people neeed not carry one because of the high memory cards available.Definitley one must carry spare batteries.What is the use of a camera bag which has no space to carry atleast 4 batteries.This bag accomodates two but the bag looks awkward with the closure of velcro.Canon had designed a camera bag with least functionality.I am looking for some other camera bag with velcro design and sufficient space to carry spare batteries.
4,Standard case,Good case and has a small storage net in front for extra memory card or battery. It does the job at a good price.
2,Well it was at least cheap!,"The case fell apart with moderate use, and the sewing failed on the belt loop Save your money and get a better case."
3,"It's an okay thing, but...","I bought this for the A95 which I plan to gift my parents. It fits well and the stuff is also okay. But I used to carry an extra pair of batteries... since A95 drains battery fast and there is no way to find out how much charge left. But with this pouch, I can't carry the extra 4 batteries. You can carry an extra memory card. Since I got a high capacity memory card, I don't carry a spare."
3,It's Okay to do with..,"Firstly, the shipped product does not match with image displayed on Amazon in the sense the Tag on the flap simply reads ""Canon"" instead of ""Canon PowerShot"" as displayed in the product image. Hence lowers on product looks!Also, it feels much bulky with Camera when i loop it through my Belt. I would have rather prefer to have a case with shoulder strap instead.Nevertheless, the case seems to have enough padding to protect your camera from damage or shocks."
4,How to take a quick picture?,after reading all the reviews I bought this camera expecting greatness. Probelem is I'm just an everyday picture taker and it's a very confusing camera for me to use. My brother bought the Kodak easy..something.. share I think for half the price and his has instant snapshot. As soon as his finger hits the button it snaps a photo that comes out beautiful and clear. Clearly this camera must do that right? I can't figure out how to do it.. can someone help me? He can take three pitures in the time it takes me to take 1. I have two children that run around and do cute things quickly and I have to be ready to just snap and capture the moment. Please tell me this camera does that! Thank you to anyone who can help me out.
2,Powell Gets His Slice,"A fairly well written but poorly edited book, especially considering its price. The title, Getting Your Slice, is unjust. Mr. Powell worked for a large national francise which is really quite different from YOU or I getting OUR slice of the pizza business. The book does give some very general information on the business (and ends with a bunch of statistics), but does not really deliver any solid advice or make any recommendations for starting a pizza business of your own."
2,"Some Good Info, But Poorly Written","This book does have a few helpful tips and some good ideas, however it is poorly written/edited. It is clear that the author has little writing experience, and the result is jumbled information, a lot of repetition, and quite a few irrelevant statistics. That said, I did glean a few ideas from this book as I skimmed through. My advice is to borrow this book from a friend or library and spend a couple of hours with it, rather than buying it."
4,Go Masters!,"This was just okay in comparison to Top Chef. I didn't like the format of the individual 4-chef challenges with the top chefs competing in the end. I would have preferred the same format as Top Chef, with all chefs competing in each challenge to the bitter end. I think that is more fair & entertaining. Overall, I did enjoy the series. I wish all Top Chef & Top Chef Masters series were available on DVD. I don't have a laptop, I-pad, or streaming capability & don't feel like watching episodes at my computer desk."
5,Lots of fun!,It is so nice to see these masters at work in the kitchen. They are all so skilled and make it fun.
5,2 of my favorite chefs...,Are featured in this season: Chef Elizabeth Falkner & Chef Suzanne Tracht. Especially in episode 2 when they first see each other. I have to love the fact that Chef Tracht looked like she was totally checking out Chef Falkner. (I don't blame her...I'd be checking out Chef Falkner too if I was her.)
5,Awesome,"The best of the best. I loved it. However, the season was too short. I didn't see Top Chef Masters on cable. Look forward to getting the other seasons when they are placed on DVD."
2,Top Chef Masters disappointing,"I think Top Chef is a 5 star show that stands up to repeated watchings. Masters is a disappointment. It lacks the drama of competition,the clash of personalities and there is more focus on the charities than on the food.Because this is a charity event the judging is perfunctory at best, just adding Tom Collichio would be a shot in the arm. I bought an episode and didn't bother to see who ""won"". Long story short- its boring."
4,"Hulk, Hulk, and more Hulk!","Incredible Hulk for Saturn is a fun action game.The game has a few puzzles to solve and switches to find, but it's mostly our green friend doing what he does best!The only thing I found lacking in Incredible Hulk were graphic details. I like playing this game, but I don't think it uses enough of my Saturn systems graphic potential."
4,Creative marketing?,This two-disc collection consists of a re-issue of two earlier Trisha Yearwood albums: Thinkin' About You and Hearts in Armor. The songs are good but I was disappointed when I found out that this is not a greatest-hits collection.
5,If you could only own 1 SEGA Saturn game...,...this game would be it! I have never encountered another game which just blew me away like NIGHTS INTO DREAMS did (once I got into it).
3,Nights,"Good game ,lot of fun.Very short however,it was meant to show off Saturn's ability,overall 4stars."
4,a real pleasant dream,"Sega fans used to eat this game up and claim it to be the ultimate adventure. It sure is adventurous! It didn't become the all-time classic that gaming magazines thought it would, but Nights has some really spectacular graphics and leaves you with a pleasant taste in your mouth. It's unlike any other game I've ever played and when you're done playing it, you think about it. You think about how there's really nothing else like Nights out there. That alone should be enough for you to look into the game.The graphics make you think ""WOW!"" Maybe the graphics are similar to Sonic the Hedgehog, but only slightly. Nights shows you how beautiful the nighttime can be if you give it a chance."
5,Gorgeous and imaginative.,"I just bought this game last week after having not played it in 15 years. The moment I booted it up, the memories just came flooding back. The graphics haven't aged too well, but the design and controls were still great. I LOVE this game! I'm just glad my Saturn still works after all this time. Now I just need ""Panzer Dragoon Zwei"" and my nostalgia fix will be met."
5,Freshman effort a wonderful listen,"J. Poole's freshman CD left me with a large smile and an excitement to hear more. Bold in her choice of music, she bares her soul in what could have left the listener feeling raw with the emotion of the music. However, she deftly handles the ins and outs of the elegant and often deceptivly light melodies while still dishing out the full range of her vocals. In short, for a first effort, Ms. Poole came off as a seasoned professional. I highly recomend this for anyone looking for a nice new sound to discuss with friends or during a dinner party."
3,Attractive Program,"While I personally do not care for high, shrill voices, Ms. Poole is otherwise an attractive performer who has chosen a consistently pleasing program."
2,Mildly entertaining,"This reality show answers an age old question: What type of women are interested in a ""rock star"" who is twenty years past his prime? Answer: barflies in their mid thirties, biker chicks in their early forties and low grade airport strippers. Also you can make a drinking game of this series. Every time ""Every Rose has it's thorn"" plays or is mentioned take a drink! Apparently it is the only Poison song people remember 20 years later."
1,A Piece of JUNK!!!,"I just bought this piece of junk. It came with a defective gas regulator, at no extra charge. Repeated attempts to contact the manufacturer, Genstar Technologies Company Inc., for help getting a replacement regulator have been ignored."
5,"Pat ,Oklahoma",I am on my last jar of my first order and I love this coffee. I keep mine in the refrigerator and it stays nice and fresh. I got tired of store bought coffee as it tasted so old & stale. The auto ship is great .
3,Good decaf,"I really like this decaf. As others have mentioned, it is very smooth. I really love that it is organic. I drink quite a bit of decaf because I love coffee but cannot handle caffeine more than once per day.Here is my only issue with this coffee. It is a *very* light roast. If you like a darker roasted coffee, or even slightly dark roasted coffee, this is not the one for you. This is considered a ""city roast"", which is very light. Even if it were slightly darker, I would buy it again. As it is, I probably will not buy it again because there are a few other options out there. I thought that I would mention this because it is difficult to tell from the photo."
3,Disappointed after all the great reviews,"After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to take the plunge and get a case of the Mount Hagen Instant Decaf. My first cup was a weird experience...wasn't sure if I made it wrong or if it had gone stale. Opened another jar and it was the same; weak, flavorless coffee, almost like drinking tea. The only things I liked about the coffee are that 1) it's organic and 2) it has ZERO aftertaste or bitter finish. I tried doubling and tripling the amounts and then it just tasted like sludge. If you like a weaker coffee or are coming from old-school instant, then this would be a good choice. Even my wife (who is more of a tea drinker) commented on how smooth, but extremely bland this coffee is.I prefer a stronger cup of coffee (not darker; my preference is a french-press medium roast from freshly ground beans). I guess back to VIA it is. I despise most of Starbuck's coffee, but VIA is surprisingly good."
3,"I went with Mary and then... well, nothing","Everywhere That Mary Went started out fairly good with some interesting plots developing, but in the end, it was nothing to get too worked up about. When we find out just who is subjecting Mary to all this craziness, we're left not with thoughts of ""Oh, of course! Why didn't I think of him?!"", instead, it's more of ""Really? That doesn't even make sense"". This book takes I-didn't-see-it-coming to a whole new level. And I don't mean that in a good way. All-in-all, a mindless rainy day read -- not horrible by any means, but not worth running to the store for either."
2,Too Many F Bombs for Me,"Why is it that today's most successful mystery writers don't need to resort to using crude language to make it onto the best seller list? That's a question Ms. Scottoline should be asking herself. Perhaps if she had worked harder at the mystery portion of the book and spent less time spelling out the F word, this book would have gotten more stars from me. Unfortunately, the book was light on plot and heavy on bad language. McCone, Kincaid & James, Plum, Warshaski, and Millhone don't use the F word in every other sentence, and they don't need to because their mysteries are so good. I get enough of crude language in the workplace everyday. So disappointing."
3,"If you are a fan of Lisa Scottoline, then this book is okay.","I got hooked the day I read my first Scottoline book. I like the characters and the not so heavy words used by the author. The only thing that bothers me whenever I read a book where the setting is 7-10 years ago that if you ask yourself if this takes place now, is the use of the phone. Today, there are cellphones everywhere that even the janitors have one of their own. Lawyers would be carrying Blackberry phones or those with cameras and multiband freq with them."
4,The Real Mary?,"The book itself was very good and I enjoyed it a lot. However, I've read several of this author's Bennie Rosato stories before it, and this one left me confused about the character of Mary.In the Rosato books, she's portrayed as a religious, mousy, goody-goody wimp who's afraid of her own shadow. However, in this story she's portrayed as an impulsive, foul-mouthed, pushy broad. Perhaps there's some development over time and one needs to read these books in order to understand it. But I found it very distracting."
3,Everywhere That Mary Went,"This is a good book but not an exceptional book. It is easy to read and the storyline and characters are well developed although I do think the ending could have been developed a little better. This is the kind of book you buy for a long flight and finish before landing, which is not a negative criticism. Overall I enjoyed the read."
3,Everywhere That Mary Went,"Really good story. Some sex, some violence, action packed. Surprise ending. If you don't have time to read this it will be hard to pick up and know what is going on without reviewing.I will read this author again."
4,Mary's no lamb,"Lisa Scottoline in her debut Everywhere That Mary Went introduces feisty Mary DiNunzio of South Philadelphia. Mary is a recently widowed, soon to be made partner of a prestigious law firm. Mary is also being stalked. She is receiving prank phone calls, notes and being followed by a car. She is getting spooked and beginning to wonder if the stalker could have been the hit and run driver who killed her husband.She has two good friends who are very interesting characters, Brent, her secretary and Judy, fellow lawyer. She also has a new love interest who she is afraid may be the stalker.Overall the book is a well planned and paced mystery, with characters who are interesting and entertaining. Book is not deeply intellectual, but that is not why one would read a book such as this. It has good entertainment value."
4,Female attorney is stalked,"Mary DiNunzio and her twin sister Angie have taken very different paths in life. Angie chose to become a nun, while Mary is a lawyer in a high-pressure law practice, working hard and hoping to become a partner. Things seem to be heading in the right direction for Mary except that she keeps receiving mysterious notes and phone calls which show that the one who is sending them knows more about Mary than she would like. The other problem in her life is recovering from the death of her beloved husband, Mike, and trying to decide if she's ready for a relationship with one of the other attorneys in the firm. This is the first novel by the talented Lisa Scottoline who quit being a lawyer so that she could write about them. Through the years she has perfected her style in which she creates a feisty, female attorney and surrounds her with an interesting and fast-paced plot. The combination makes for a very good read."
3,Lisa Scottoline's Women Attorneys,"""Everywhere That Mary Went"" is an entertaining book with interesting lively characters and unexpected plot twists. Most Enjoyable!"
1,Warning to Catholics! This book is anti-Catholic!,"SPOILER ALERT!! I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who hasn't read this, but I thought I should warn fellow Catholics about this book. Yes, she's a good writer. But she a) has a really, really bizarre take on Catholicism and b) she puts in digs that will make Catholics cringe.For example, the main character makes nasty asides about how Catholics don't mind if someone belongs to the mafia, so long as he contributes to the church. Oh, right. Lying, theft and murder--not a thing about them in the ten commandments.At the end of the book, the main character's twin sister leaves the convent. She apparently only went into the convent for cheesy pop psychology reasons, but a visit from her twin turned her around. The convent is portrayed as cloistered but (get this!) the nuns get vacations. Talk about laughing out loud. And there are these grim, horrible sayings everywhere in the convent.Take my word for it: this is one Catholic will want to SKIP. +"
3,Slow for a murder mystery,This was the first book of Lisa Scottoline's that I have read. It was adequate as a murder mystery-a little slow with no feeling of real connection to the characters. I'll still give the next in the series a try as I have heard good things-maybe my opinion will improve.
1,Oh My God...this is so boring...,"I tired to like this book and the author. This is the third book that I have read from this author and they are all mediocre. The theme for all of these books is strong, independant smart women. Unfortunately, the women are dense, whiny and so bloody annoying. In this book, Mary flips between tough, whinny and I honestly don't even care any more who, or why anyone is stalking her. The whole scenario with her twin sister the nun, is beyond stupid, and again shows that Mary the ""hero"" is unfocused. If I was her ""new love"" I would have dropped her as soon as possible. One minute she is in love, the next she thinks he is her stalker, then in love again, then her stalker. Waste of time, only finished it because I was hoping it would get better. Did not happen."
5,SMELLS JUST LIKE ROSES,IT SMELLS JUST LIKE ROSES. EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!!! VERY HAPPY WITH IT. WILL ORDER IT AGAIN.
5,Execellent device-driver reference,"This book's #1 audience is the Unix device-driver writer who wants to understand how Linux's kernel, interfaces, and data structures work. #2 comes the journeyman software engineer who wants to look ""below"" the application layer, toward creating more efficient programs.There are clear, *working* examples throughout the book. Each chapter builds on the previous one. Complex issues come late in the book, after the reader has had time to build a framework for understanding."
3,"Reference material, ok; but a tutor it's not -","I picked up this book about the beginning of my linux programming experience. It was all pretty, and the suggested material inside also led me further down learning lane. But, the book itself was not very helpful to me. I had no idea where to start, and the only tutorial in chap. 2 was ok, but had no use to anyone who wants more than ""hello world"". It wouldn't work without forcing insmod, then the kernel complained. Learning the Microsoft WDM was easier than this book made things... B-sides, we can all do the same things in C. All in All, i was frustrated with this book.It's free at [web address] <under the GNU Free Documentation License> if anyone felt like an online reference to linux drivers.Bottom Line: As others stated above; not for the beginning linux driver writer. I await the fruits of: ""Writing Linux Device Drivers; Takanari Hayama"" Due in mid-December. Hold out for it, maybe that'll b more in depth. I'll tell u either way -"
2,need more work for beginner,"it's good to explain in code fragments. but this book only works in fragments, leaks complete and integrated code list for each example. also need more detail in compiling, installation, run, and the whole view of each example. i doubt the author has relly done his driver ""scull."""
3,"Good, but could be better.","While I have found this book to be the best reference available on the topic, it is largely because it is the only book available on the topic at the moment. When it was released in 1998, I'm sure it was a far better resource, but with the changes made in the 2.2 (and upcomming 2.4 kernels) This book is BADLY in need of updating.While informative, the writing leaves something to be desired. Often, the only way to comprehend a section is to read it a couple times, make notes of questions, and come back to it after reading later sections or digging up the information online.My advice if you need this information, but can wait for a few months is to wait for the second edition, due later this year. Hopefully it's authorship will be more in keeping with the traditions of O'Reilly and associates."
5,Possibly still the best book on the subject,"Even though the third edition is showing its age - it covers kernel version 2.6.10, which is terribly old - in my opinion this is still the best book on the subject.Generally, it is not possible to create an up to date tutorial for programming the Linux kernel, since it changes constantly. SO, the key is to introduce the reader to the way of thinking necessary in order to understand and develop for the kernel. I think this book succeeds marvelously."
4,"A good balance of ""How"" and ""Why""","I have read both this book and Sreekrishnan Venkateswaran's Essential Linux Device Drivers, both are excellent, I prefer this one on generic topics such as:Chapter 5. Concurrency and race conditionsChapter 8. Allocating memoryChapter 10. Interrupt HandlingChapter 14. The Linux Device ModelHow ever Sreekrishnan's book covers video and audio driver which are useful for my work.As for styles, both keep a good balance of ""how"" and ""why"", I think the ""why"" parts are more important, the whole s/w is all about concepts."
4,In-depth coverage of creating block and character drivers.,"I've not been happy with some of the O'Reilly books I've gotten lately, but this book is an exception. While there were a few problems that should have been caught in the review, it's a truely useful book. It even looks like the index is functional.The one thing I wished it had was coverage of the VFS. However, if you need to write a character or block device driver, this book will enable you to do it."
5,"A ""must have"" book on Linux Device Drivers","If you are going to write device drivers for Linux, you must have a copy of this book on your desk. Another _winner_ title from O'Reilly."
3,Review of Linux Device Drivers,"This is the best book on the topic because it is the only book. It gives a rather clear idea of what a driver is and does and provides interesting details about the inner workings of the linux kernel.However, it only provides snipets of code. Complete working examples are lacking. If, for example you are trying to figure out how to write a device driver that uses interrupts and actually works... good luck.The book needs to be upgraded for the 2.2 kernel as none of the examples work with this kernel. O'Reilly has a website where one can get examples that are supposed to work with the new kernel. They don't and they are not complete.I'd suggest waiting for the second edition. That's probably why the price for this edition has been dropped by %20."
2,"Linux Device Drivers, 3rd edition, Kindle edition","The book is great in content and organization. I specially like the examples, very helpful and illustrative. The only drawback I found is that now is more expensive the kindle version than the paperback, but before it was half the price. Not worthy to pay so much for a book that is freely available by the authors."
4,Works great,"The BOSS AVA1404 works great, and definately improves the sounds coming out of my subwoofer, I have not used it for regular speakers however."
1,Base does not work>> woffer..,"Eq, is okay.. But as for the Base on woffer.. Nope. it does not work.. Do not know why. someone else wrote same thingon review on this Eq, I just thought they did not know what they are doing,, But they where rite.. And would cost memore to mail back.. so will not by anything else made by BOSS."
2,no rear view,no rca outputs: no rear view picture available: sent it back for the clarion model 20$ more but way more versatile
1,whoops,"In reading the products info I had no idea this was for a 12 volt car system, I waas looking for a home 110 volt EQ."
5,Just a great upgrade,"Wow. Without this Boss AVA 1404 7 band equalizer/200 watt 4 channel amp unit, my new Pioneer stereo would sound week and lack clarity. The head unit settings just don't match the quality of the 7 band equalizer. Your radio songs, old mp3, and new mp3 songs may sound differently and my latest mp3 downloads have a much higher file size and produce even better music. There is a lot of variation in music recordings. My system is complete now with 6 new speakers, this Boss AVA 1404 7 band equalizer with 200 wats of power (that is 50 watts per speaker), a 1 csqf custom sealed woofer enclosure 12 kicker shallow mount speaker, Boss PH3KD 3000 watt mono block sub amp, and Pioneer DEH-P5200HD receiver.I've tweeked everything and used an iPhone frequency analyzer app. This eq/amp is crucial in making music sound really really good. No problems found. Highly recommended."
3,50/50,"I knew going in after reading the reviews on this unit I had a 50/50 shot on its functionally. I had purchased one previously from another company and had no problems with it. The one I purchased through amazon however did not fair as well. After hooking it up I had power and LED lights but no signal to the speakers. Sent it back asking for a replacement, after about 3 weeks and several E-Mails to the company I received a refund which I clearly stated is not what I wanted. I sent the company a somewhat nasty-gram then immediately purchased the unit through the company that I got the first one from. In summation know going in that you might get a faulty unit, but that there is no other manufactures out there that I could find that make a amped EQ. All others are passive"
2,Inane and Disrespectful,"It is hard to understand how a bland movie that was made for women - ends up insulting women. The vacuous script is full of cat-fights between girlfriends, who have been like sisters. They are absolutely horrid to each other when they find out that their dream location for the marriage (The Plaza Hotel in New York) has only two openings for weddings on the same date.You wonder why they just don't have a double wedding and save some money - but how they fight over attendees, and dresses, etc. left me incredulous.The bottom line is best friends become worst enemies just because they chose the same wedding date and the same location.The plot is weak - and the expensive weddings featured must be promoted by the billion dollar bridal industry.Both Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson could do much better."
3,Occasionally Funny... Mostly Flat,"""Bride Wars"" is a great premise with great leads, great music and great production qualities. It also has TERRIBLE supporting actors, an average script and really poor characterization. Unlike the 4 dimensional characters in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" ""27 Dresses"" or ""The Holiday"" these characters are flat, predictable and unnatural. Even Anne Hathaway (who I love in most films) seemed flat out awkward and strange portraying her character (Watch the school hall scene towards the beginning and tell me she is not TOTALLY uncomfortable.)So, all in all, this film has several sweet moments and a few great laughs... it's far from perfect (or even above average) but I recommend one viewing. That should be enough."
2,"Average, At Best","A decent movie, at best. Featuring Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson, the film is about two friends and their competing weddings. A chick-flick, that's all."
3,Cute movie,"Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway are very good in this movie. It won't win any academy awards, but it's definitely entertaining."
2,Pathetic piece of nonsense,Only the production quality saved this movie from one star. The story is just plain dumb. I know it is a movie and of course it is fiction. But even movies have to be just a tad realistic. The skin and hair pranks were simply way too outrageous. And then the video at the wedding. Give me a break. Avoid purchasing this movie.
4,"Very fun, and I don't even want to get married!","Very fun movie that made me jones for my best friend AND my boyfriend. Nice combo to find in a nice, light, entertaining and fun film. Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway were great! And it was fun to see Kate Hudson's hair-dye in that one scene...I actually loved this movie. It has a ""once apoun a time"" element that frames the story, and its light and funny. The story is silly but still relatable. I noticed some of the reviews critique the movie because the women seem ""dumb"" for how they react to potentially sharing a wedding date. It's a comedy! The movie isn't set up to be all about bride-zillas, its about two friends who have shared everything for 20 years and then... this happens... and an innocous mistake snowballs into... well, that's the movie!Ditch the dudes and watch it with a gal, or on your own for a little pick-me-up."
2,bland,I expected it to be funnier. I would say that its something to watch if you dont have anything better.
3,Mixed Feelings,"The plot-line is very funny and the actors are both very good, but I cannot suggest this as a good movie. It was sort of saddening to see this very comical yet true portrayal of what marriage has become today. I wouldn't want my daughters picking up this idea, so it won't be a movie my children ever watch, nor will I be giving much of a second-go.For those who don't share my sentiments, there is only mild vulgarity and innuendo. I wouldn't consider the actresses to be impeccably modest, but they aren't as bad as usual in most modern movies."
1,Bridal throwdown,"When dreams are at stake, even BFFs will go to war. Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Liv (Kate Hudson) have been dreaming about the Perfect Wedding for 20 years and it doesn't matter if they ruin their friendship as long as they get it. I love the two actresses, but that's about it as far as the movie goes. I had one moment of hilarity seeing the two brides duke it out going down the aisle. It's predictable, only mildly amusing, and not the best of its genre.Rebecca Kyle, May 2009"
5,Great movie!,Love this movie! ultimate cute movie that is perfect for girl's night with best friends. i recommend this to anyone that loves chick flicks and it arrived on time in good condition.
5,Fun to watch,"Bride Wars stars Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway as best friends since childhood. Both girls Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Liv (Kate Hudson) have aways shared the dream of getting married at the Plaza Hotel in June. Plans change when they go to the Plaza Hotel to did a date for the wedding, only one of them can get married at the Plaza Hotel in June. The two best friends are at war with each other so they can have their dream come true. Which girl will have her dream come true? Watch the movie and find out ."
2,Two great actors but it didn't meet expectations,"What not to like about Katge Hudson or Anne Hathaway? Bridal Wars I couldn't wait to buy but actually I was disappointed. I love romance, happy ending, weddings as I've planned a few. While they were BFF's, the wedding scheduled on the same day, one had to give up a veneu.......a fight.Well it all sounded good to me and I wondered if their friendship would survive it was just getting there and they way the storyline somewhat didn't meet my expectations."
3,Bride vs. Bride,"""Bride Wars"" tells the story of two lifetime BFFs, Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Liv (Kate Hudson, with really bad bangs). The young women get engaged right around the same time and happily begin to plan their dream weddings at the Plaza together. Unfortunately, a mix-up with the wedding coordinator causes both weddings to be booked on the exact same day. Once that happens, Emma and Liv's friendship is all but forgotten. The cat claws come out as both girls begin feuding and try to sabotage each other's weddings.This is a total girl movie that's not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination, but it has some funny moments, and any woman who's ever been involved in wedding planning will appreciate it on some level. I enjoyed it."
3,It is just ok!,"It was predictable. I would watch it again if it was on tv. I would not buy this movie or rent it again. I noticed a lot of these chick flicks are not as good as they used to be. 3 stars for me because Anne and Kate have good chemistry. I am not a fan of Anne, she is replaceable and quite boring, but Kate is fun to watch."
2,Scary women.,"I caved in this weekend and let my wife pick this movie, (but only because I got two other movies for myself) and we were kind of let down. This was one of those cases, and most female oriented movies are, that the previews almost turn out better than the actual movie. Even my wife commented on how they were so mean and rude to other men that we both could not figure out why anyone would marry either of them. There was not enough story development to make it worthwhile. I definitely would not buy this one. Rent it first, and then if you like it, buy it."
4,Bride Wars,"BFFs become Bridezillas - slapstick, fun, silly, heartfelt moments. Shows just how far some people will go for that ""perfect"" wedding. Definitely a chick flick."
2,Not the Best From Those Two.,Definitely Not impressed with these two actresses. Was looking forward to much more. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.
3,Bride Wars,"Liv and Emma are best friends who since childhood have planned every detail of their respective weddings. At the top of their bridal ""must have"" list: a ceremony at New York's ultimate bridal destination, the Plaza Hotel. Now, at age 26, they're both about to get married; they're about to realize their dreams; and they're about to live happily ever after. Or maybe not. Some parts of this movie is funny, but a lot of it was just too contrived. Ti's decent."
1,Really?,"That pretty much sums it up.are they for real?sad times for us humans everywhere to have the burden to carry this garbage of a ""movie"" its a shame cause they are both very good likeble actresses."
2,movie review,"I was expecting it to be better, it was ok..kinda depressing movie w/ some funny parts in it. It was just ok"
3,Good Movie,It was a good movie. I expected more because most of the cute scenes were shown on the ads for the movie. I will probably watch again in a year or so and it may be better then.
2,Bride Bores,"This movie could have been a HUGE hit.Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway and everyone in the film are great,but the movie is so boring.This has to be one of the worst films for 2009."
4,Fun Movie,This is a funny and touching movie. Great movie about friendship. I'm surprised at the bad reviews.
4,Funny!,"I will say that the movie's idea that two best friends can't agree on a better solution than to have competing weddings on the same day because of their childhood dreams is silly. However with that said, I still found the movie entertaining. Some of the things Hathaway and Hudson do to sabatoge the each others weddings are really funny. It would be nice though if movie studios would quit showing so many of the funny scenes in movie trailers. Overall, a cute movie!"
2,A bit overdone,Great for complete boredom and as a way of feeling better about yourself. As a die hard romcom fan I still found this too petty and annoying.
4,great,the best dvd that i own its has great sound quality and great picture it is mine now i do not have to rent it from blockbuster or the library. this copy was in great condition
3,Torn between two weddings,"""If I were your wedding, I'd be sleeping with one eye open...""Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. BFFs Emma (Anne Hathaway) and Liv (Kate Hudson) dream of their dream weddings at the Plaza Hotel2. This is the one thing that Emma has ever wanted3. Liv always gets everything she wants4. Oops! Both weddings get booked for the same day5. Open warfare commences6. For most of the movie7. Bit over the top if you ask me8. ... but funny anywayThis is a straight up chick flick, made watchable by Hathaway and Hudson. If I lost you at ""chick flick"", I apologize, but this is exactly what this is.The sabotage scenarios are mostly funny, albeit highly improbable, but this is a good movie to rent for an afternoon giggle with the girls, over wine, cheese and chocolate.Warning: Forcing menfolk to watch this may constitute grounds for divorce in some countries.3.5 starsAmanda Richards, April 4, 2009"

3,Metal to warm you in the cold Russian winter,"If you like Amorphis, Tuonela especially, you will probably like Black Art. This is atmospheric doom metal at its very definition: slow, melodic tunes void of angry screaming and rapid-fire double kick drum explosions. While Amorphis is more guitar driven with respect to the writing style, Mental Home leans towards the keyboards and vocal stylings as guides in composition. Nonetheless, none of the songs really stood out to me as exemplary--- it's as if the whole is better than the parts. You can't just listen to one song, you have to hear the entire album to fully appreciate the mood Mental Home strives for. Well crafted, Black Art showcases these Russian's ingenuity and commitment to a genre underappreciated by many."
1,Mystery Plan,"As of today August 19, I have not received anything on this plan.No paperwork,no backorder....NOTHING !!!I think maybe it's just a rip-off."
3,Replacment Plan Review,"I just received my bread machine and have had no need to use the 1-year replacement plan which is an extension of the manufacturer's warranty. I really cannot rate this item until I try to use it. It was necessary to ""rate the item"" so I selected #3 (middle number).I did receive the item in the mail quickly."
5,Outstanding,"This is, in my humble opinion, the best CD Nikos ever released, almost all the songs are a treat from the start AND get better each time one listens to them. If you haven't heard of Nikos Karvelas yet: This is the CD with which to remedy this sad loss ;-)"
5,You Want to Get David Z's CD!,"I really liked this eclectic album of electronic music. It's fun, upbeat, and great to walk, exercise, or drive to. The professional reviews are right. Listen--I think you'll agree. PS: My hip techno friends like it, too (I bought it)."
3,Very interesting music to listen to,"I recently got the chance to listen to this album. And I have to say, I like it! 5 tracks, all instrumentals, but all have a different feel. I'm not usually into instrumental music that much (I like to hear words!), but David Z made it interesting to listen to. The music is kinda spacy at times, quite techno or '60s phychedelic at others. Great to dance to as well!"
1,No ink...,"Perhaps we got a faulty version, but there's no ink in this pad... If you wipe the stamp across the top, rather than pressing, you can get a very faint image. I would recommend looking for another ink pad."
5,I like this tea and I like the company too...,"Nicely flavoursome and refreshing tea, grown in a way that sustains and fairly rewards the Chinese producers.Green Tea is loaded with antioxidants which are superb anti-ageing and healing ingredients, doing battle with all those horrid little free radicals! The Tea does not merely have to be drunk either, it makes refreshing facial spritzers, the cold bags are great for revivng tired eyes, you can even put a couple of bags in a hot bath and enjoy the Green Tea aromatherapy.After all that you can stick them on your compost heap and return them to the earth. The Husband and Wife team behind this company are ethical and fair trade to the max! He was a top tea taster for the Lyon's tea company and she has a healthcare background. Slightly more pricey than other brands but when you know why you don't mind paying the extra. Even if not parting with the cash for ethical reasons it is worth it for the work they put in to giving these teas flavour and body."
3,very mild green tea,"This is a smooth mild tasting green tea. If you like the type of green tea served at Japanese restaurants, you should look elsewhere. This version doesn't have the same strong flavor."
5,Best base coat!,"This base coat is the best I have found in years. It protects my nails from getting stained, and it has also strengthened my nails! You can't go wrong!"
4,Helpful but not great,It helps the nail itself but doesn't keep the nail polish color on well. If you have thin nails it helps
3,Hm ... not a huge fan of this in particular,"I am normally a huge Essie fan, but this base coat was a little disappointing. It looks nice alone since it's a little opaque, but at least on me, it lifts and chips rather easily. I even tried it with a coat of good to go, and it didn't help. I haven't tried it under polish, but when I do, if I see different results, I will update."
5,Very Distinctive!,I just got this watch and I love it. The time piece is very distinctive and people will notice you are wearing a quality Swiss time piece just by the looks of it. This version offers a rubber strap but can be confused with leather by the look of it. The time piece is larger than most Omega wristwatches and you can feel the weight on your wrist when you are wearing it. Has helium escape valve function which must be used if you don't want the dome to shatter from the pressure of deep sea diving. The watch is rated to withstand 2000ft/600m.I never went swimming or diving with this watch and don't really intend to. I wear this with my dress pants and dress shirt and it looks fantastic. I bought it more for looks than function. But know that it was created for diving.
1,NEVER EVEN GOT IT BUT PAID FOR IT,"I FELT IT WAS A GOOD DECISION TO PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT PLAN/GUARANTEE WHEN I PURCHASED FOR AN AIR CONDITIONER AS A WEDDING GIFT ALL BOUGHT ON AMAZON. THAT WAS BACK ON JULY 18TH, TO THIS DAY THE RECIPIENTS HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CONTRACT. I HAVE HAD LOTS OF CORRESPONDENCE BUT NO SATISFACTION FROM EITHER AMAZON OR THE SELLER...JUST LOTS OF EMAILS. WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO SEND THIS CONTRACT TO THE RECIPIENTS? VERY STRANGE AND UNPROFESSIONAL TOO."
2,No.,"No, we shouldn't play Fischerrandom chess. Gligoric gives some interesting games, yes; but they show little about actual chess. Besides, this variation is hardly Fischer's invention: it was played long before Fischer was born."
3,OK,"In this outing, Laura Gemser is not Emanuelle, doing undercover journalism at a prison, but rather a hard con doing time. Lorraine de Selle is still on staff and still has that hooker underwear she modeled in CAGED WOMEN, and best of all, the haystack hair blonde and skinny teenish brunette are both doing 20-life here too. The blonde looks as if she's eaten a little lasagna since the previous picture. Her opening scene finds her wearing nothing but *tight* kini panties, over which her tummy roll hangs enticingly. Wow! (scene is 'way too short.)Here, dangerous male cons are temporarily housed in the women's lockup, but they get loose and a riot ensues -- at least when they're not having sex with horny femme cons who haven't seen a man since the Aldo Moro administration. No shower scene in my video copy, which is always a drawback, though it does feature a weird theatrical presentation by the inmates, for the inmates. OK of its type."
1,"they made me ""list""...this was listed as ""x""....LIE!","this was listed under ""xxx""....with 5 stars.....not even porn. will never buy from them again. list your stuff accordingling"
2,Another side-scrolling action,"This is just another sidescrolling action with comic characters in it. Not much new gameplay elements to offer. The features would be the relatively good 3D graphics and you can occasionally shoot into the background. This somehow does make the game difficult because some of the crucial targets are in the background and if not destroyed, you will notice that ou may end up restarting that level without knowing what is going on.Power-ups are not fantastic, it just gives larger area for shots and not much special abilities to look forward to.Go for it only if you love side-scrolling action, otherwise i would not recommend it to people who want to try it."
2,"Not a great teaching, in my opinion","Maybe I'm missing something: I was very excited to get this book. But when we read it the first time, i was very disappointed! Yes, Cornelius does go off and do his own thing but why does he care so much that the others appreciate what he does AND then why does the story end with the others trying to copy him? Doesn't that counter the story- that he does his own thing for the value of individuality and is fulfilled by doing it, without always having to have reinforcement from others? And that the other crocs don't have to copy him and lose their own individuality?I haven't wanted to read this again for my daughter after the first go round."
4,I cried!!!!,"Yes. I cried. This book shows enough emotions that a betrayed woman would surely have. In one seating as I read it, I firstly cried when he offered money for the ""service"" of her body. The nerve of that bastard! Lily loves him despite of everything he had done to her - that was before her wedding-to-be to her cousin then was sabotage by Devlin,lout.He wanted her to pay and suffer. Poor Lily - innocent as a lamb. After loving him so much. I was glad that she continued to live despite of everything bad that had had happened to her life. She remained strong. I wish I have the same courage. I might have kill the man who had taken everything from me, betrayed and mistrusted me. From all the people, he should be the one to know that she's innocent.Patricia Gaffney's works are superb! That is why I love her works. They are all intellectual literary piece. I sometimes love angsty works and she gave a good one!"
4,"A Really Fine Story, Brooding and Romantic","When Lily escapes the plans of her lunatic family to marry her off to an emotionally stunted theology student, she grabs the first chance she can think of and hires herself out as a housemaid, ending up in the lonely, brooding Cornish end of the world, with a dashing, mourning Lord drinking too much and a house manager straight out of ""Rebecca"" to break her spirit. This is a different sort of romance novel. The writer is comfortable with dark themes, and the supporting characters are more than mere caricatures. It put me in mind of Wuthering Heights or Jane Eyre, although, of course, it didn't come close to those masterpieces. Still. An awfully good read. I lent this to a friend of mine, and I've not gotten it back because she keeps re-reading it."
2,Have read much better by Gaffney,"While I can't complain about the style of the book, I will complain about the characters. At every point where the hero has to decide if he should trust the heroine, he believes the absolute worst of her, not once but three times. Each times he humiliates her worse. On the last couple pages he admits he was being a jerk, but we're never really given any evidence that he really reformed. Each time after he humiliates her he feels bad, then he ends up doing it again. The end just looked the same way. Unfortunately it felt to me like Lily had entered into an abusive relationship, not a loving romantic one. Want a great Gaffney, try Wild at Heart or her To Love and To Cherish trilogy, but unless you like *really* domineering males, pass this one by."
4,Great Pan,This is a great non-stick pan. I love it because you really do not need to add anything to your food to keep it from sticking. The only downfall is it's weight. It is heavy and hard to handle when moving it from the stove to the counter or elsewhere. The lid is also a nice feature for the price. A great deal overall.
3,It's only ok...,This was only an ok game. The graphics are childish and if you don't know what you're doing - you won't go very far. Got tired of the game and haven't played with it for weeks...
1,disappointing edition,I bought this book as a presentation item but I am returning it - the so-called imitation leather binding looks and feels like plastic.Very unattractive and unpleasant to hold.In its favor it is very small and light- maybe too tiny for most readers.Still looking for a suitable personal sized Prayer Book.
5,Carry your own personal prayer book on Sundays,This attractive leather bound prayer book is beautiful and makes it easy to get to the many pages that are used in your Sunday service. At home you can feel good about marking your favorite passages.
5,"""A ver nice version of the Book of Common Prayer""","I bought this book for my husband as a Christmas present. We were familiar with the book and knew exactly what the contents were. He is very happy with it. It came with a nice leather cover and the print is easy to read. It has a place in the front for ""presented by; wedding, baptisms, and confirmations"" which is nice. It is the 1979 version of the Book of Common Prayer he had received in 1954."
5,Perfect,"We bought one of these for each of our sons on the occasion of their Baptism. This is a perfect gift edition. I really like that this edition is thin and portable, making it more likely that my sons will use it in the future. I plan on buying this edition for myself to take on my next military deployment, and would highly recommend it as a gift for any service member of the Episcopal faith."
5,Get the job done!,We use these at our church for our Children's Ministry communication with our Safety Team and they are 100% reliable and very durable. We've had them for 2 years and have never had problems.
3,An edgy combo of Aussie Jewishness and noise,"Oren Ambarchi and Robbie Avenaim were Hasidic students of Talmud and Tanya. They were members of the Australian punk band, PHLEGM. This CD combines influences from Boredoms and the Japanese noise scene, traditional Jewish Nigunim and Yiddish theatre. It is a new world of twisted tones and distorted dreams."
1,very redundant,"This is a very strange CD, and I mean VERY STRANGE. I do like Hasidic Nigunim as well as punk, but this pointless noise is too much - even for me."
5,Another good buy,I bought this book to explore the idea of making my own paper to use in my paper art. Very well written.
5,A complete handbook for living life from the heart!,"I am absolutly thrilled with this book. It is jam packed with the best tips and info on how to simply apply Spiritual tools which aren't always easy to get a grasp on. A perfect book for a beginner on a seeking path or an old hand. It is fresh and light and written very clearly and too the point. Its a perfect gift for any one in your life: boss, child, parent or friend...its very helpful and safe for people who might freak out at a book thats TOO ""spiritually."" I want to give it to everyone...its a real winner. Using your heart to guide you through life...who wouldn't want to learn that?! Thanks to all involved in creating this little gem!"
1,"UNhelpful, UNseeing Psychic....be warned.","My friend ""Brenda R."" used to see Bobby on a regular basis. She paid alot...ALOT of money to do so. Everyone has great things to say about Bobby, and I think he may have a few abilities - but not where it really counts. Brenda could have used his help to get her affairs in order - if he'd been able to see that she was about to DIE. She was found dead on the floor in her bathroom form an aneurism at age 46, in Knoxville., TN.If your psychic can't see THAT most dire and important event coming - then why bother with him?"
4,A Saturn Must Have,"What a classic! Every remaining Saturn owner out there should have a copy of this. The environments are wonderfully imaginative, the replay value is long, and the music is very cool. The two player mode is terrible, and the 7 total worlds to fly in leave you wanting more, but don't let that fool you as to how much fun this game can be.Nights was developed by Sonic Team, the best developers at Sega. Check this one out!"
5,Great Leg workout,"This workout is good for all, not just men. Precise and effective in a manageable amount of time."
4,Cute costume,"My son loves his Peter Pan Costume. It looks really cute on him! It is very thin, so we will have to hope it is not too cold on Halloween night."
3,Okay,"Got this for my nephew. I think it is overprice but it gets the job done. Make sure your child, depending on where you live, is equipped for cold weather as the costume offers little in the way of protection from the weather."
5,great look,"Bought this for my sons during a halloween period and they stood out ,not like the typical spiderman or batman but like the vintage Peter Pan and they looked great.The costume is really good and I bought 2 and have since given 1 to one of their friends,some years later because it has stayed relevant as well as wearable over the years."
3,It was good.,It was a cheaper Peter pan out fit. It worked I had to hem up the legs just a touch but I usually order a bit big.
2,Poorly Made,The belt of this costume would not stay fastened which needless to say can cause some issues while out trick or treating. I would not recommend this costume.
5,"The quality is not the best, but my 2 sons love to wear it!",I have a particular attachment to this outfit because my two kids enjoyed it so much that my wife and I had to beg them to wear something else!
5,Perfect fit,Costume was a perfect fit for my 7 year old son. He was able to move freely and remained comfortable. We had to bobby-pin the hat down for it did not stay in place well...but that was easy to resolve.
5,feel good music...,"After a week in the desert looking for water, I'd rather find a dusty bar with no drinks and Lovelock playing on the radio."
1,hooked on phonics,"This book sucked. I felt like I was reading one of those hooked on phonics books for kids. The narration was simple and irritating. The characters were undeveloped. The story line would have been great, written by another author."
5,"When you have the BEST, why mess with the REST? :o)","~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The other reviewers have just about said it all: in short, this is a GREAT book!I would just like to add that it is good to have ONE book that over ALL the essentials of Linux as compared to those who cover just PARTS in one book and more PARTS in another (just to sell more books?).I own MANY books on Linux, but if I were forced to discard them all but ONE, THIS is the one I would definitely KEEP! When you have the BEST, why mess with the REST? :o)Lloyd W. Cary~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
5,Good spy farce,I have the entire series and enjoy it whenever I watch it. The clumsy super agent who always screws up but still wins is hilarious plus Agent 99 is pretty easy on the eyes.
3,"Good deal for the price, seams rip easily though","For the volume, this is a good price. The way the envelope is puffed up in the photo, I thought there was some padding in it. There's not. (That's my mistake though.) The seams rip a bit too easily from the top. I usually just add some tape to reinforce it during shipping. I have mailed out several items with these envelopes and haven't received any complaints, so it seems they are holding up."
2,"Cheap price, poor quality",I bought these because they were cheap but the price reflects the quality. They rip easily and are very thin. You can see what is inside through the envelope. I would not recommend these to anyone and will never buy again.
1,Another rip off,"The product said it was something it is not.I needed help in an area that is quite personal to me and the product said that it could help , but it did not so I am still looking for something that will."
2,Not better than my RCA Rabbit Ears,"It could just be my area. I'm within 25 miles of the tower, but I couldn't receive the NBC affiliate. Turned the antenna slightly toward the compass setting and the ABC affiliate would go out. Tried the RCA rabbit ears that I already owned and got the exact same reception patter. Like I said, it could just be my area. I have tons of trees in the neighborhood and a lot of surrounding houses."
2,Hardly Satisfied,The antenna shipped relatively quickly. I installed the antenna and was quite excited when I received quite a few channels. The day was overcast and drizzly the next day was much clearer and all the channels were gone. I am within 40 miles of the towers yet reception is fair at best. Highly recommend you live in a relatively flat area.
4,Channel Master 4228HD,I get a stronger signal from an older and less expensive 4 bay Channel Master CM4221 and it is not as unsightly because of the thinner wire mesh reflector. The 4228HD is very large and has a reflector of several large gauge aluminum rods that are quite visible outdoors. It is best used in an attic where it will not be seen.
5,Can Be Used Indoors,"I bought this antenna knowing that I was well within it's range so I could put it in my attic. Well, needless to say it works perfectly after having been told I would need some high-powered external antenna to even have a chance. I know, from doing my own research, that results are completely dependant upon several very different variables, but it works for me and works well. I have it hooked up to an OTA DVR via a 50' coax cable and get signal strengths in the mid 80s on almost all my channels (occasionally it will jump to the high 90s if there are storms rolling in). I did notice that about once a week I'll have 0 signal on several stations I normally have high 70s to low 80s on. The weather will be clear and sunny. So I know it's not that. It always seems to be the same set of stations, so I'm thinking it's them and not the antenna. Oh, and as a side note, OTA HD is so much crisper/cleaner/clearer than cable/sat HD."
4,Beats paying cable or satellite bills for local HDTV reception,"This antenna works well and is relatively unobtrusive, considering its size; I have not determined whether its upper VHF reception capabilities are any good, but it is sensitive and directional for UHF TV signals (for which it is designed)"
4,Channel Master TV antenna,The antenna is successfully able to receive a clean TV signal despite an installation height of only 10-12 feet from ground level and also that the generating stations are approximately 60-70 miles away.
3,Bought for second home,"Works ok. My biggest problem is the location and orientation of the house makes reception difficult under the best circumstances. Between the antenna and ROKU, I ditched the Charter cable which stunk."
4,Channel Master CM 4228HD,"I lived in Santa Clara, California. This antenna received the VHF and UHF channels from San Francisco and Oakland. I only put the antenna on a tripot in my back yard. Sometimes the signals are weak, particularly on the rainny and windy days. My friend recommended me to buy another 10 foot mast to made the antenna higher and the signals stronger."
4,Rooftop antenna,"The channel master 4228HD antenna works pretty good. I live at least 50 miles from the television stations putting out their signals, and my channels come in clear with almost no interupption. And that is with the antenna only about 20 feet in the air. I am sure once I get it mounted in it's permanent spot higher up I will get even more digital channels from further out."
4,It brings 'em all in,This antenna has saved me a monthly fee from cable or satellite. I am 25 miles from Seattle stations....in the trees...and although I get break-up when the wind blows I receive all area stations. I am very pleased with the antenna. My attic antenna I had before the changeover to digital no longer did the trick but Channel Master saved the day.
2,Not a VHF Antenna,"I take no issue with the product. My problem was that the Amazon add stated that this antenna was both VHF & UHF. After I installed it, & got less reception than my original on a few channels, I called Channel Master tech. They informed me that this antenna is a UHF antenna, even though it will receive a small VHF signal just by virtue of physics. So it worked just fine on the UHF signals, but I was already getting excellent reception from my original antenna. I must say that Amazon showed their usual class by allowing me to return the antenna for a full refund. So, I am writing this review just to warn you that this antenna is a UHF antenna."
5,A must have,"If you are beginner to expert, this helps with simple methods that are tried and true. I find it most helpful in giving me ideas of how to address problems far beyond the scope of the book. Sometimes just simple reminders of cookbook methods stimulates thoughts in orthogonal directions that yield the best solutions to customer problems."
5,many points of veiw,"The beauty of breaking a huge mirror then taking a picture is,... each of thefalling pieces shows a different angle and this book gives you lots ofprograming ideas to work with using different ways to do it formany of the Examples,... if your a program inventor , and if your stuck on howto do something you should get this book!! then you can spend less time searchingthe internet for answers and more time being productive.This book will show you how to use perl in many ways that you may not have realized,or have had no idea how to do. this book also givesDiscussions on why the code works the way it does. and then shows another way to do it.""this book is on the desk not the shelf """
3,I never use it!,"I thought I would use this book, but I rarely do. If you are the kind that appreciates using working examples and fitting them for your own uses, then maybe this book is for you. If you are prone to reinventing the wheel (like myself), you'll need more advanced Perl texts that go over tips and tricks as well as explanations themselves.Many people use the internet to download working examples of Perl applications and scripts, then modify them for their own needs. I think this book was written with these people in mind. I just haven't needed this book -- or if I have needed it, its format and purpose is not one I can get my mind around."
5,Just shut up and buy it!!,"If you use perl at all, buy this book. It will save you hours of head-scratching. This will not teach you how to use perl - just how to use it well."
3,Not that Organized,"This book has some good tips and techniques, but sometimes veryhard to find. Best if you use it with another perl book say, ""Programming Perl""."
5,"Incredibly useful, as a reference or for learning Perl!","I started skimming the book to find out more about certain subjects and ended up reading it from end to end. Well written and brimming with real-world code, this is THE book to read - after Programming Perl of course."
5,A fantastic resource for Perl programmers,"This is a first and best of the O'Reilly cookbooks. A few people have told me, ""I don't know Perl, I just use the cookbook."" It's sad but true. But it shine well on the book that has recipes for literally all the basic stuff you will need on a daily basis with multiple version of each solution so that you can pick the one that works best for you."
4,what a great reference,"i keep this book close to my keyboard. i'm still learning perl, and everytime i've hit something that i don't know how to do yet i've found an answer in here. the table of contents is really detailed, so you can just find the area you're looking for, skim down, find the exact problem, and flip to the page. you'll have your answer in seconds. pair this with programming perl (which i still use mostly for the great listing of all the built in functions)."
5,"Great book,but u should read a book like Learning Perl first",The Perl Cookbook is great. It has lots of info. Even though I have been programming a long time I didn't understand everything right away. If u have read other books on perl before and u understand the basics of perl u should DEFINITELY buy this book.
1,You should not buy this 1st edition,There are so many errors in the book (about 350 errors). It was said that the book was hurried to meet the deadline (for Perl Conference). I suggest to wait until they fix them in the second edition.
3,ok book,for a beginner like me this book was a second read after I finished the llama book.. bit bulky but worth the money
2,go with programming perl instead,Don't spend money on this book. Unless you are a beginner with no experience you will not learn anything new from it. Programming Perl is a much better book that contains all of the information found in this book plus x10 more.
1,Highly overrated...,"When I first looked at this book, it seemed like a good idea. Perl is sufficiently arcane for there to be lot's of simple solutions that will not be immediately obvious. However, the book has two major faults. It is too thick, and it is too specific.What I had hoped for was something like ""Design Patterns"", but for Perl. But instead of trying to generalize, this book tries to list every specific problem that the beginning Perl programmer is likely to meet. For that reason it is unreadable. Any real insight is bound to get hidden in between dozens of trivial tasks. And when you actually meet some problem you think would be a good idea to look up, it is unlikely to be exactly the same as the authors envisioned (why not simply write a library instead?).With the general incompetence level in the IT-sector during the dot-com bubble, it is possible this book needed to exist, but today it seems like a monument of stupidity, a useless reference that will catch dust forever."
2,entertains you on a boring day,Johnny Bazookatone is basically a game with a guy who has a bozooka. Basically the point of the game is quite like the scenrario for mega man. Go around blasting bad guys with your gun. I recommend this game for one of those days you're bored and feel like playing a game with the simple goal of shoot and kill.
2,SNAKE POPS OUT EARLY,"You don't have to wait the entire movie to see the low budget monster. A group of scientists go to the Amazon in search of a Fountain of Youth only to discover it is connected to a giant man-eating snake, who doesn't eat once a month like most snakes, but rather eats large meals daily like most man-eating movie snakes. The scene where the helicopter is in the air and gets struck by lightning, I watched several times. It reminded me of those old Flash Gordon serials where the plane is flying on a string. The movie has a lack of bad language, sexual scenes, or nudity. The gore is minimum, but people do get bit in half. It has that ""made for TV"" movie feel, which is bad. The characters are not that well developed or likable as I found myself rooting for the snake."
2,Better than a sharp stick in the eye,"This is the low budget version of Anacondas: Hunt for the blood orchid. Considering that was the worst movie I've seen in years, this is actually quite a bit better. I give it two stars. Some pharmaceutical company finds and old dead guy from the Amazon, turns out he was 200 years old when he died, they send a team to investigate. They run into a big snake. The characters are all cliches, from the greedy corporate guy to the rough-and-ready Amazon guide, but at least they're not caricatures of cliches like in Anacondas. The story is a cliche as well, they meet some primitive tribe who know the secret, but they don't want anyone to know about it, some other stuff happens, guy kisses girl. The cinematography is pretty good, and overall it's watchable. If your expectations are kept extremely low. If you like low budget movies, this might be okay to have sitting around for some night when you're really bored. Not at this price though."
3,"Meh not bad even for a ""Bad"" Movie",thought this movie had alot of promise its about a buncha scientists who find a sarcofogis thingy and it turns out that the body was 300 years old before it died so they go BACK into the forrest to find out if theres a tribe with the same blood thing and they run into a giant snake who kill everyone and thingThought this movie was going to be about a half man half snake hybrid thing....its not i was pretty upset but i love movies like this that only get onto the sci fi channel and even then only a few select people will watch itOverall not bad but i recommend like Frankenfish or Dragon Wars 1st
5,black angel,"i have just been getting into mica paris again but had never listened to this album before.i am a big fan of hers , and have to say that this is her best album of all! her voice is at its best, over a collection of classy songs full of soul and mellow beats.classic!and like so many great singers, will never be allowed the wider audience she deserves.buy this now!"
3,Wrong item,"You should have specified in the review that this equalizer was for a vehicle. I needed one for my home stereo. Therefore, I returned it."
5,Long Live Baaba Seth!,"Few bands offer an opportunity to look at the future music like Baaba Seth. Mixing folk, reggae, world, rock, jazz-funk and a heavy layer of African precussions, Baaba Seth is good dancin'. It is a fusion of sounds of a more interconnected world that doesn't lose a sharp political edge with upbeat tracks. The band is great live and great recorded. This is a very different and upbeat sound coming from the same region that gives us Dave Matthews, Baaba Seth - we miss you!Love is better! You bet."
3,Aqua Yoga,"This looks like a wonderful book. It guides the reader through a seris of exercises designed to relieve the stress of pregnancy, preparation for birth in water, and recovery using the techiques from Yoga. Lot's of beautiful pictures."
2,Competitive Fire - Not my favorite book on the subject,"I've been reading a number of Sports Psychology books of the past months. I found Competitive Fire to be the least compelling of the books I've read. Clarkson provides many quotes and examples from professional athletes, but doesn't manage to organize the material in a way that provides ""Insights to developing the warrior mentality"". I found it to be a repetitive collection of quotes with no particular direction.I much prefer and recommend Flow in Sports by Susan A. Jackson, or In Pursuit of Excellence by Terry Orlick. You might also check out Mastery by George Leonard, or The Mental Edge by Loren Christensen."
3,Not subtle enough,"This book is close to that fine line that helps bring seekers closer to God and the bible thumping scripture warns us against.I found the book entertaining and well written, but spoke more to general how to conduct business and how to lead a simple life than it was about lessons learned at Enron. I shared it with some Enron employees hoping to move them closer to God before actually reading it which was a mistake. The book comes on strong. This is an excellent book when shock therapy is required to snap people out of bad business behavior."
4,This book is even for readers who don't like religion books,"This book offers an excellent look at the problems at the former Enron within an ethical and biblical perspective. It is well written and a pretty quick read.The book offers a lot of lessons in busines ethics without being too ""preachy."" The book has a wide appeal that I think will make it an enjoyable read for both Christians and non-Christians.Overall, a strong recommend."
5,Finally a Porsche 911 SC book!,"This book is a welcome addition after one of Porsche's most reliable cars has been out of production for 23-28 years. Adrian has succeeded in capturing all the nuances and issues for the Porsche 911 SC with concise wording and great pictures covering all the uniqueness' of the Porsche 911 SC.While not a complete ""shop"" manual, this book give us DIY'ers enough information to steer us into making good decisions and giving us a wealth of knowledge about our cars! The comprehension of this book will astound all SC drivers and impart things we never knew. Adrian covers all major and minor systems with so many details in 432 pages!Considering the number of Porsche SC's still on the road today, this is must have book to round out our complete knowledge of one of Porsche's greatest road cars!SC owners...take note!Kurt FischerVP, Redwood RegionPorsche Club of America1980 911 SC Weissach owner for 10 years"
5,If you own a 911sc this is a must,"There were very few 911sc cars made, and information about them can be hard to come by. If you own a 911sc, this is (like the title says) the essentail companion. Worth every penny."
4,Beautiful,This is a beautiful piece. I love to wear it. It will dress up any outfit. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the chain is very weak and breaks easily. -- Misty Lomas
2,Recorded Versions?,"I have transcribed many of the songs in this book before this book was available. I'm sorry to say there are quite a few problems with the transcription accuracy in this book on the songs I have looked at - wrong key changes, wrong time changes, and wrong notes. A Day in the Life is just one example. If you are a beginner, the inaccuracies will not bother you, but for advanced players it is frustrating to get a book labeled ""Recorded Versions"". I have bought many Hal Leonard books in the past and have not had the issues as with this one. If you are going to transcribe masterpieces - Do it right! I would recommend the yellow Beatles bass book as alternative to this one."
5,Perfect book,Seems good to me. Love these recorded version Beatle books. Been playing guitar for 40 years so I decided to expand a little and bought a bass (for me and my son to play). I have no problems following the tab and it seems 99.5% accurate to my ear. Wish they offered these books for all the Beatle albums.
5,Purchase this masterpiece!,Bought this CD after only hearing a few 30 sec. samples and I am glad I did! This is one of THE BEST Black/Death Metal CD's ever! You better buy 2 because you may wear the first one out! Killer!
3,Not quite as good as others of hers,I am a Scottoline fan. This was not her best. I am from Philadelphia so enjoy the area details. The plot was a little tangled and title didn't seem to fit. Otherwise it was nbot a bad read
3,Glad it wasn't her Final book !,"I love her books therefore want to read them all ! This one was pretty good yet I can see her work has gotten much richer as she's continued to write. Don't get me wrong, this one is good and holds your attention until the end but I personally like more recent titles better."
3,Final Appeal,"A very slow to start book, I almost gave up on it but glad that I did not as it got more & more interesting. It is the first time I have read this author...would read her again!"
3,Ok. Reason,Ok I pledge to the flag of yesterday please let me pick another book. Thank you. Ok to the good news
2,"ok, not great","I read a lot. This book was average in the writing style, and plot. I like mysteries and thrillers so I'm always prepared to finish the book whether I think it's great or not."
4,Final Appeal has appeal,"Lisa Scottoline does a fine job of keeping the story fast-paced and interesting! I enjoyed the personal attributes that she gave her secondary characters and the moxy of the lead character. It's always nice to see a capable female taking a lead role. It is a good book to curl up with on a rainy evening, and I'd reccomend it for it's sheer entertainment value."
4,Scottoline is always a great read!,Dialogue is excellent between the mature clerk and the three young ones. A fine mystery with lots of intrigue. I like the main character.
4,"Final Appeal, a good read!","""Final Appeal""by Lisa Scottoline was an enjoyable read! It seemed a little slow to start with, but then I got in it and I really enjoyed the book."
3,not a bad read,Having not read any books before it was difficult to understand some of the motrivations of the rosotto character. That said i did enjoy the book.
4,Unconvincing in spots,"A great read, with some laugh-out-loud lines, but Scottoline fails to give us a credible villain here--probably for the only time in her career. Other characters are finely drawn, however, the dialogue is snappy and convincing, and it's a page-turner."
2,Not Scottoline's best work,"I've read three other Scottoline books and liked all better than this. Of course, this was written when she was a fledgling novelist, so she's learned much from good editors over the years. In this book, she writes in first person, which I found limiting. Supporting characters did not ring true at all. Also, her political views determine the course of the plot. This is a very bad mistake, I believe. All of the more conservative types are villians, all of the liberals are heroes. Identity of killer is predictable for that reason alone, and it's not a good enough reason. One wonders why this particular book won an Edgar Award.In her later books, like Legal Tender and Mistaken Identity, I give Scottoline an A for plotting and an A+ for pacing. They're written in third person and her quirky characters are all interesting if not totally believable. But the books move so fast, you go with the flow anyway."
2,"""Final Appeal"" Should Be Reversed and Remanded","After reading and enjoying ""Everywhere That Mary Went,"" Lisa Scottoline's first mystery novel, I was disappointed in this effort. Although the main character is sufficiently developed and the story will be of interest to those familiar with Philadelphia, the plot itself -- the cornerstone of any mystery novel -- is fair at best. The various clues seem contrived. There are fewer of the clever observations which permeated ""Mary"". Worst of all, the novel lacks the suspense which mystery readers crave: ""whodunit"" is reasonably predictable, and for obvious reasons.I am surprised that this novel won an Edgar. It held my interest, but is nowhere near the novels of, say, Michael Connelly. It is a nice, quick beach read, but you can find many better novels in this genre."
2,Why didn't I read the Amazon reader reviews first?,"I learned long ago to skim through the Amazon reader reviews before I invest a weekend ( or a long rainy afternoon ) in an unknown ( to me ) author. But since my wife brought a paperback copy of ""Final Appeal"" home, and it WAS cold and raining outside, I took a chance. I now know that I should have walked over to the local library instead and started with one of Scottoline's later ( and presumed much, much better ) offerings. I suggest you do the same; pass this one by and get one of her later mysteries."
4,A Homicide Novel?,"Bought this to replace Joel Goldman's ""Shake Down"", because the main character had to be an attorney and written from an attorney's perspective. Since there is a lot of reading in a College Paralegal Degree program, I then bought the 'audio' version. Then my Criminal Law & Procedure Professor says the 'audio version is abridged' and she rather I read the full version. I haven't read it yet, but I sure hope it lives up to the criteria and plot/them she wants. I have it on my Nexus 7 but I cannot figure out how to have the eBook read via 'text-to-speech (TTS)'! Sure wish someone at Amazon would help me achieve this; I have 3 TTS program software on my N-7 and just can't get them to read the eBook. I definitely need some help as the deadline for the book summary draws to close for comfort. Help, requested, Please. \ Mr. ZQMA*9 L.E. Swanston, Jr."
4,good legal thriller,"I really like Lisa Scottoline's legal thrillers. I was a bit confused by the title that included rosato and associates, as this character was not connected to that law firm in any way that I can recall. An interesting story."
3,BIG Disappointment,I usually enjoy books by this author.This offering was definitely disappointing.I hated the stupid interplay between the characters. I am glad it was only 99c.
4,Typical Scottoline fun.,"Sometimes I think Lisa's work is almost TOO cutesy, but I still enjoy her writing. She's clearly very bright, and it shows in her witty one-liners. You know what to expect from her, and she consistently delivers it. If you've enjoyed her other books you'll enjoy this one, too."
2,ho hum,Its not up to Lisa's normal writing. It is sometimes very boring and sometime childish. I would not recomment it.
4,Enjoyed after the first few chapters,"It took a while to get the who group of characters sorted in my mind as to who was who especially the people in the office, then enjoyed it"
4,Lisa Scottoline .thanks again for a great read!,I have enjoyed many books over the years by Lisa Scottoline. Again I was not disappointed by the pace and content of her story line.
4,Final Appeal Review,A noteworthy female character is a central figure in all Scottolines books and the setting set in the Supreme Court deciding life and death issues makes for a good read.
2,Trendy ?,"It was a fun read. Somehow, murder is not very funny and cuteness doesn't make it. If you want funny in this genre, I would recommend anything by David Rosenfelt. It doesn't mean I wouldn't read other books by Ms. Scottoline in the future, but not right now for sure."
2,Any other Scottoline is better,"I only recommend this one to completists like myself who compulsively insist on reading an author's full body of work. Final Appeal is my least favorite by Scottoline, but it's only her sophomore effort and from here it keeps on improving."
2,Only if you are a beginner to Linux/Unix,"I bought this along with ""Linux in a Nutshell"" when I decided to look into Linux. I've got a 20+ year background with Unix. I'm sorry to say I never found this book useful! Between my experience and the modern Linux installers (I've got Mandrake) this book is redundant. That hasn't been true for the Nutshell book.I gave this book two stars because for beginners it offers a decent introduction to Linux."
3,Unnecessary,I got this book after a friend of mine highly recommended. Unfortunately I feel buying a book on Linux makes little sense giving that Linux constantly changes and the book is never up to date. Also there is a ton of material out there on the WEB so unless you just want your bookshelf to look good there really isn't much reason for buying Linux books.Other then that I think this is still the best written book about Linux. It's easy to read and it doesn't make you fall a sleep after first few pages.
1,Total crudd,"Not good at all. This book will teach you to do things but not figure out anything, it will teach you to do the most basic tasks but leave you dry when it comes to actually doing anything not covered in the book. Consider this book giving a man a fish instead of teaching him to fish."
4,Perfect Linux book for novice!!,"This book talks about basic things to get Linux work on your PC. It has a section about the history of UNIX and Linux, which you might want to know if you are really interested. I might recommend this book to starters of Linux, but not to people who want to be a power user. And I felt it was little bit out-dated. If you are looking for recent information of Linux, you might want to get other book, but if you have no idea what Linux is but you want to know about it and use it on your PC, this book is what you want to buy"
1,"If you already know some Unix, forget this book","If you already know a little bit of Unix or Linux or other Unix-variants, this book is way too ""introductory"" for you. It covers stuff like how to login and run ls, cp and mv. As another example, see the section on backing your computer. It talks about using find and tar, but nothing about dump and restore and backup strategies.Overall, too much scratching the surface and not enough in depth information for real Unix users."
2,Not helpful,"The back of the book says ""widely recognized in the linux community as the ultimate getting started and problem-solving book"", ""will provide expert advice when you need it"" and ""one of the ultimate linux manuals"". I haven't yet had a problem that this book helped me solve. I understand that it can't and isn't meant to cover everything. But I was annoyed that it's ""in case of an emergency"" section basically said that users should have a rescue cd with enough tools to recover -- but not much on how to recover. Now, whenever I break something, my recovery is 1) check Running Linux and find nothing helpful, then 2) throw the book into a corner and search the web for people with similar problems."
2,Not Extremely Helpful,"I bought this book because I am switching from Windows to Linux on my home network. I thought it might be quicker to learn the ins and outs with the book vs. surfing from place-to-place on the web. My experience with the book is not that great--it never provides enough information on any subject to answer the question I have. I always have to resort to the internet for enough information to solve the problem of the day. It might be o-k for general Linux information, but it won't get you up and running as a system administrator on a home network."
3,"Great Book on Linux. Dated, though.",It's 1999 almost. Linux has progressed so much since 1996. I can't wait for a 3rd edition since there is no substitute for ORA books when it comes to linux/unix literature.
1,The Publisher's review is confusing,The Publishers review lead me to belive there was a CD rom of Linux included which there is not. Running linux with out Linux Thats a Trick
1,WWWWWWWWWWWWWoooooooooWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWw,I was surprised at the upmost stupidity of the author in this book. This is just like what you can read on the linux homepag
4,quite good - doesn't cover everything though,"This is a highly regarded book by most and I agree. The style is clean and to the point. It tells you what you need to know - gets you in and out and on to the next problem.Anybody comfortable with computers will not have a problem with the book. It doesn't have a lot of fluff and they don't spend half the book on a command reference (just use the man pages). They tell you the main issues in running linux and how to handle them.I would highly recommend getting a second book with this one ""Linux : Installation, Configuration, and Use"" by Michael Kofler It is in the exact same style and just as good. Kofler, however, covers many topics that ""Running Linux"" doesn't and vice-versa. For example, only one covers setting up Samba. Only one covers shell programming in detail, etc.. (sorry, I don't remember which).If you get both, you will have pretty much all you need."
3,"Well written, but dated...","This is a very well written and readable volume on Linux. However, it suffers because of it's age. Linux is a very dynamic OS and has seen much development in the years since this book was published. Hence much of the discussion, while at one time necessary, is somewhat lacking in relevance for more modern distributions. The book does have value though and is an enjoyable read. If I was reviewing this back in '96 it would most assuredly rate a 5. For today you may be better off with something a bit more up to date, however, such as the ""Complete Guide to Linux""."
5,The first and best Oreilly book I have read,"This is the first book I had ever read about Linux, and it is still the best. I found it to be most useful in explaining simple things that other linux books (and webpages) overlook. It also explains things rather clearly, and provides a nice intro to just about everything a beginner needs to know. If you are somewhat familiar with Linux, you might still find a few things you didn't know before, though I'd recommend reading another book. Anyhow, money VERY well spent!"
1,"There is much, much better available","This book is supposed to serve as a reference, something you keep on your desk and refer to when you want to tweak the desktop settings, make an adjustment to your sound setup, change your boot manager, etc, etc.It's not. Avoid this book. It is incomplete and shallow. If you need help with your Linux installation, get ""Linux in a Nutshell"" from the same publisher. It is a vastly superior book. Or just Google for a solution to your question/problem - your chances of success are much better.The money that I spent on this book was pretty much wasted."
2,Not for Newbies,"This book is not for newbies and most certainly not for home users. All through the book the author keeps saying "" see your system administrator""! Hey guy, thats me, not a lot of help. Also, I found no help in it for two minor(?) problems I had with my installation of Redhat Linux 7.2 - no sound and no printing capability. I'm sure that when I become accustomed to Linux - if I haven't thrown it out before that - this may become a good reference book. But a guide for newbies it aint!!"
5,Note 3rd edition published in August 1999,This page fails to account properly that a new edition is out. A lot of the links and all the reviews up to this point are for the second edition
4,Excellent source for basic Linux information,"I've referred to this book many times during my first two weeks running Linux and it has been a great help. It is easy to read and provides tons of basic information about Linux, perfect for the first time Linux user. I would suggest using this book in conjunction with the installation HOWTO's that are available on the web. The HOWTO""s will provide you with help on the current Linux versions and Running Linux will bring you up to speed on the basics of the system. A very good book"
3,just a warning......,"i have never heard this record, but i just wanted to make sure everybody understands that this is a different band than the hot water music that put out ""no division,"" ""forever and counting,"" ""fuel for the hate game,"" etc. i'm sure these guys are wonderful, but nowhere on this page does it mention that they are, in fact, two entirely seperate bands. the hwm that i'm familiar is one of the best bands around today, and everybody should check them out. these guys, like i said, i don't know about."
3,Replacement Module for Jungle Talk Jukebox,"Replacement modules work fine, bird likes toy. Ordered jukebox(comes with one module)and 3 replacement modules. CON: Not allowed to choose songs. jukebox came with module song ""For Elise"". Replacement modules sent 2 ""For Elise"" and 1 ""Twinkle, Twinkle"". Contacted seller about exchanging 2 ""For Elise"" for 2 different songs that I had ordered replacements for variety. Informed not allowed, you get what they send, no promise of variety. Seller did say they'd allow return with refund but by time return ship paid would have paid more than modules cost."
1,it does not TALK!,"It does not talk, only makes tones of a music box.They sent me 3 of one tune(twinkle twinkle little star), and 1 tune called 'love storey', that I do not think sounds like ""love storey'...just harsh ear piercing notes!"
3,cute for a very young child,Nice for a very young child but it only is fun for a few minutes. Good product but has some chipping after a couple of months.
1,very messy,"Although this self tanner gives a relatively natural look and smells OK, I foundthe gel formula to be very messy to use. I used a sponge as well as my hands.In using my hands, there is no grace period in washing it off. It takes about10 minutes with a brush, soap and exfoliant. I would not buy it again."
3,Good not great.,Smells great. Looks good but is not nearly dark enough for me. It says dark and I expected. DARK. Not so much.
4,Doesn't destroy my hands!,"This cleaner does not destroy my hands like other cleaner do. With other cleaners, my nails begin peeling the very next day after use. While not a heavy duty cleaner, I like the results on kitchen and bathroom counters, sinks, toilets, and mirrors. It cleans painted woodwork very well (handprints, smudges, and oily dirt from the cat rubbing on it). An extra benefit from using this cleaner is that I can BREATHE without choking from the fumes and strong scents found in synthetic cleaners. I gifted it to my daughter who offered that she liked it, and was surprised that it did glass. Although I use it for mirrors, I find that I get smear marks on my windows..probably because they are in full sun (I get smears from Windex too)."
1,Don't waste your money on this item.,This video was very disappointing and was a waste of money. It was a cool idea (interactive) but the actual video was a HUGE disappointment. NOT worth it so don't waste your money on purchasing it.
3,Greco-Roman Beliefs on War,"We used this book as part of a college military history course. The first few chapters were well received, but readers including the professor became somewhat disengaged with the middle and later chapters with the trend moving toward a more philosophical discourse and away from the earlier analytical style. Still, it is a worthwile read if your interests are Greco-Roman warfare beliefs and influence into the modern world. ""The Antique Drums of War"" or "" ""The Pursuit of Power"" might fit well with Dawson's text as complimentary reads."
5,Filling the gaps,"This work fills a void in African American and general U. S. History. It is important for the general public, not just academia. Business success has became a negative image for too many youths, and this work shows that African Americans have always been successful within the capitalist system as entrepreurs, not merely consumers. It also demonstrates how African Americans have been a vital part of the economic development of the nation!"
5,Oh Brother,"Wow. Some say this album is the greatest live album ever recorded, and I find it hard to argue. All you people sitting at home, bored, watching tv, should listen to this show now and understand the meaning of the word SOUL. The brother had soul, more than anyone else, ever, and he let it all out that night in 1962. Get up and dance -- listen to this show and you won't be able to resist. Amazing."
4,"A brief, engaging look at an eccentric character","A look at the life of magician, inventor, gadfly, Cecil Nixon! Well researched and amusingly written. I really love the ornate cloth binding: uniquely ""high class"" for an independant, small-press type of book"
3,A study of western influence on large sections of Africa.,"This book provides a detailed history of the influences of western society on sub-saharan African culture. The reader should be aware that this is a ""history textbook"" long on facts and at times dull. However, if one perseveres many gems of information can be gleamed from the book's pages. This is not a quick read and requires some effort to finish and absorb all the detail. It would be great for the novice scholar or student. If you are looking for a text to give a brief and concise overview of the subject look elsewhere. The book lacks the necessary maps, figures, charts etc... to retain this readers interest for more than brief reading sessions."
5,Boss DB-30 Dr. Beat Metronome,Bought this for a niece that is majoring in music at Berklee in Boston and she loves it.
1,Frustrating Product,My brother and I have two of these dr beats which eat batteries at an obscene rate and have a ridiculous glitchy problem of reseting whenever it feels like it.On other listing of this product up to 20 out of thirty people report this problem and it is mentioned on many customer review sites.I've spent over a hundred dollars over the two metronomes so far and now i do not even have a single one of them working properly.Boss ought to do a recall...
4,Keeping Time,"I like it. Simple design, fairly easy to use. Set a meter, pick a click to the beat. It will do straight time and allows you to use off beat, triplet, or sixteen beat options. It is a necessary tool for any drummer at any level."
4,Good Book,"I got this book for my daughter, it is her summer reading project. She will be a freshman this year. She is refusing to read the book because it sounds boring. She likes Gossip Girl, etc. She has 8 days to read it. Anyway I enjoyed the book, I read it to test her, to make sure she doesn't just skim over it."
5,"Great information on VBA, Office!","This book is easily one of the best VBA tutorials I have ever seen. It helped me build custom VBA programs to take control of MS Word, even to reformatting the printed pages on the fly to make them conform to the features the printer offered! I can't recommend this book highly enough to the Office 97 user!"
5,One of the best games for saturn.,Virtua cop and virtua cop 2 are both great games. The both work with the stunner. I recommend you buy them both.
5,Virtua cop,"I just got this today for my sega saturn, I love it. It is a first person shoot em up with cool graphics and loads of weapons. You just shoot the bad guys through each stage. A classic sega game. One of the best shooters I have ever played."
3,"Rich sound, so-so music","Good luck finding three string player who produce as rich and luscious a sound as the Belcanto Strings do on this CD. Wow! I'm just bowled over by the beautiful sounds one hears here, even when they're playing pianissimo. One can buy this disc just to wallow.Sadly, from a musical standpoint wallowing is about all one can do. These pieces are certainly not badly crafted or bad-sounding, as they wind their way through the conventions of late Romanticism. They're simply not terribly memorable.The Reinecke has a pleasant stuttering Andante and a finale that builds from a rich Adagio to a pleasant Allegro. The Fuchs has a nice set of variations on a Scottish folk tune. Sadly, however, I found my attention wandering from time to time.Still, one doesn't get out-of-the-way fare like this too often, so if you're in the mood for lavish string sounds, this might float your boat. I certainly intend to play it from time to time when I want to relax after a hard day."
2,"Shallow, deceptively titled, out of date, and naive","A combination of early 90's OO and cribbing from software engineerinng books that if, you are worth anything, you've already read. This book conspicuously fails to deal with the special problems of game architecture and development, or to deal with the most relevant developments in software engineering in the past ten years - or to mention that the authors' only major game shipped years late."
3,Only for the Pros,"GA&D has a great deal to offer to the game programming industry. This book is full of good content on running a large game developement shop. Working with team members, dealing with management problems, etc. However it is not a hands on approach (the author tells you straight up, this is not a book with code in it.) If you are looking for how to design a game, and you are a small shop or shareware author, this book is not for you.This is really a design guide for the high profile game industry only."
2,Somewhat intersting,The first 3rd of the book was intersting because it dealt with game play. The rest of the book was a rehash of project management material. If you already know about project management then go look for a book on game design because other books cover Project management better.
2,"Starts out great, gets bogged down in business","If anything, this book shows why most game software is bland and uninspired. The authors start off with a series of interesting and well written chapters about game design and all-important playability. Good, good stuff! Then it degenerates into Dilbert-esque management nonsense which is completely at odds with the first section. ""Let's be creative and innovative while we work with a team of fifty people in a corporate environment!"" Unfortunately, this makes the first part seem like so much hot air. As a cog in a development studio, your influence over the direction of a game is limited, to say the least. So, sadly, the book is more for managers than anyone else."
5,"The last reviewer, Ishai Asa, is misguided","This book is excellent, although not perfect. Just check out the other reviews to get a *real* opinion."
2,A bit outdated,"Most guidebooks are republished every year but this little wonder has gone several years without a revision or counterpart (until this year). The information is decidedly outdated when it comes to certain important details but the general information on neighborhoods and such is still somewhat useful. The size is perfect, and its very lightweight. However, with the pace with which things change in Brazil and especially Sao Paulo, I would wait for the guide that is coming out this spring if you can."
2,"Fodor's Pocket Sao Paulo, 1st Edition",Not that useful.....didn't really help me during my one week stay in Sao Paulo
4,"FINE PERFORMANCES, MINOR BLEMISHES","Judging by the samples on [...], these are very fine performances; this singer has a beautiful sound, the tempi are generally well judged, and there is the passion promised in her singing and in the playing of the very fine accompanist. I understood very well her spanish, and found only a few, though annoying, blemishes; for example, in ""El Vito"" she does the word ""real"" in two syllables instead of one (Marilyn Horne makes the same mistake), and there are wrong stresses here and there, in individual words or in phrases. Very occasionally she gets tripped over text or fioritura, like in ""Cuba dentro de un piano"" or the Seguidilla murciana, but these are difficult, even for a native speaker. In balance, the pluses are more than the minuses: i'd like to own this disc; but remember, i'm judging this only by the samples."
2,No True Workout,"If you are looking for an exercise video this is not for you. The workout section is extremely short, and hard to get to. I also didn't see how it was helpful to scoliosis. Its a pretty standard Pilates routine. Also, you need to buy fairly pricey equipment in order to even do the workout. The equipment is not sold on Amazon, and is difficult to find. Don't be fooled if you are told you don't need the equipment, you definitely do. Most of the DVD contains information your could read about in a book. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,low-intensity,"I suppose this video could be useful to people with more severe scoliosis and/or old age. But the workouts are too easy for a half-way fit person. And since scoliosis varies so much from patient to patient, it'd be much better to visit a good physical therapist a couple times."
4,Adventuure for the desk bound,"Dodge speaks well of the sea and the solitude it can create as he circumnavigates the oceans. His log maintains an even keel inspite of the turmoil at sea. For the uninitiated, American Promise is a strange setting for soul searching and learning to love. Well done Dodge."
1,What in TaRnaTiOn?!,"I love The King, but I couldn't stand this cd! It doesn't even sound like him, and the music stank! I'm verry disappointed"
3,"Some touching, torching songs","Here is a relaxed set, occasionally draggy and weighty, yet containing all classy and affecting heart ballads, some in the more esoteric category of ""beat ballad"" - ""Exactly Like You"" is one. Another is track #5: B. B. King *and* Ivory Joe Hunter fans will love to find ""I Need You"" [as indicated on the jacket], which is more commonly known as ""I Need You So"". Elvis Presley fans just might crack a smile, too.B. B.'s g-box is a bit subdued, as is his singing, which of course is expected of the still powerful blues stylist at age 75 or so - though in the v-box area he registers throughout.""On My Word Of Honor"" is a King recut of the Platters' song and follows the Hunter number as an enjoyable take of a lesser-known '50s tune.By far, the best offer is ""A Mothers' Love"", something new to this Reviewer, and a prime reason to revisit this set.In summation, a success for the deeper fan of B. B. King and for those who just enjoy hearing classic R & B and Pop standards."
2,b.b. king???,"I should have know better than to buy any album where the artist is recording ""standards"". The only thing worse would be an album of Christmas music by b.b. I listened to the first song and thought I was listening to show tunes and then fast forwarded through the rest. B.B.'s voice sounds as good as ever but the concept is a waste."
4,Memphis Kings,"The Amazon staff reviewer may consider Always On My Mind, Willie Nelson's, but to the rest of the world, the original version by a certan E A Presley remains the definitve. Interestingly, BB also tries his hand at another Presley recording, albeit not this time a Presley original, namely Tomorrow Night. Neither is a match for the Presley versions, despite these (in Elvis'case)being recorded 18 years apart. However, overall, Reflections proves once again that BB King is one of the greatest singers of all time and further underlines the tragedy that his old Memphis buddy isn't also still singing the Blues...."
3,"very simple, wan't impressed","I purchased this for my daughter after debating going straight to the FIAR series. After receiving the book I was not impressed. While waiting for my purchase, I started a list of activities we could do for the different titles. I'm sad to say my list was more imaginative and thorough than B4FIAR's suggested activities. Additional activities I found online were more enjoyable and free to obtain. This may be more suited to the younger end of the 2-4 age range. We will be moving onto the FIAR selections and skipping this book(except to do for our own enjoyment-great titles to read!)"
2,Not impressive.,"I was not impressed by this book. The activities are mostly common sense things that anyone with an imagination can do without this book. There was nothing that inspired me, as most of the activities were things that I would do anyway after reading a book to my child.She includes a Bible reference for each book. This may be useful if you want to tie your reading in with the Bible. This could be useful if you don't know the Bible well, but still want to include it. Since I didn't wish to do so, and it was the only information that was new to me, I mention it. Certainly there will be someone for whom it is helpful. My inclination though is to think that those who wish to include a Bible reading that relates to a story know the Bible well enough choose a scripture by themselves.This book was very expensive for the information it contains. With a little thought, and a trip to the library you can do the same things with your kids...."
1,Cheaper elsewhere,You can buy this direct from publisher for $35 on the five in a row website my one star is for the high price from these resellers! the book is 5 star
1,A disappointment...skip this one,"I have both ""Five in a Row"" (for older kids) and ""Before Five in a Row"", which is designed for younger kids ages 2-4. While ""Five in a Row"" is not bad, ""Before Five in a Row"" is not worth it. Many of the children's books (at least 7 or 8) are out of print and a few are nearly impossible to obtain, even at our public library. As others have pointed out, the suggested activities are mostly common-sense and rather unimaginative anyway. Also, the ""Five in a Row"" series has an evangelical Christian focus, which may not be appropriate for everyone.Some better alternatives for preschool children include ""Ready for Reading"" by Ashley Bishop and ""Peak with Books"" by Marjorie Nelsen. These books are non-sectarian and use classic children's books that are more readily available than the titles suggested in ""Before Five in a Row."""
4,Must buy several books,"This is an incredible resource with great ideas. What's wrong with it? It was written a long time ago and requires that you purchase several Childrens books that are not current! They are very difficult to find and frankly don't attract my daughters attention. I think the lesson plans and suggestions are incredible, but it would be wonderful if it were updated to include some more contemporary selections today as well. I will continue to use this with my children, but was unaware of the extra purchases I'd have to seek out."
3,"Not as good as ""Five in a Row""","If you are looking for a text to give you ideas that you wouldn't come up with on your own, this may not be the book for you. I'm sure that ""Before Five in a Row"" is intentionally simplistic because the audience IS children ages 2 - 4, but I wish I had realized that before I bought it. The book choices are awesome though! On another note, I absolutely love ""Five in a Row"" which is very throrough and creative and teaches me lots of things I didn't even know!"
3,Too Many Books Out of Print,"This is a great resource if you are interested in sharing good books with your children. My only disappointment (and a rather large disappointment at that) is that several of the titles are out of print--Yellow Ball, My Blue Boat, The Quiet Way Home, The Red Carpet, and Jenny's Surprise Summer. Five out of twenty-four titles! Almost one-fourth of the stories are available for purchase, but only if you want to pay $20-$60 each! I feel that if BFIAR was updated to include all books that are in print (maximum of one to two that are not), it would be worth the full price. As it is, it's only worth 3/4 of the price."
2,Unrealistic,"Now I get that this book was written a while ago, but the ideas behind taking out ""Big Brother's"" weapons in this book are farfetched and too dependent on chains of events lining up perfectly. Attempting any of the tactics in this book is likely to get you only one thing if used against a professional army: Dead. Dead in a way that will leave your killers going, ""Man, this guy must be from a family tree with no branches."""
4,Great Book,"I loved this book Ragnar Benson does a great job of giving the people what they want. I loved this book and would strongly reccomend you read it. If you like it than pick up a copy of Ragnar's Action Encyclipedia, its great."
1,"keep shopping, this ain't it!",what a waste of money. this book does not contain any real information at all. basicly you could sum it up in one sentence: make a molotov-cocktail and burn it. my mom could have told me that
5,Extremely handy. Buy two !,"For some time now I have been producing my own wine. I've done Raspberry, Blueberry, Elderflower, Turnip, Lemon, Lime, Tomato, Carrot, Leek, Spinich, Aniseed, Liqourice and even Rabbit. Now I have quite a large pile of bottles stored in my third floor one bedroom flat. What I've needed for some time now is somewhere to store/display these home made delights. I have recently acquired a plot of land on our local allotment with a view to having some sort of shed to hold all the bottles. I saw the Deluxe Wine Room on Amazon and thought, ""Ah Ha !"". I bought one soon after and have now erected it on my plot. Now I can take any prospective purchasers to the ""show room"". Thanks Amazon. You made my life more comfortable with this lovely item."
5,Wonderful story for preschoolers,"This is a classic story for young children, that I have known for many years. The only thing I take issue with (now that we are so environmentally aware) is the burning of leaves, today we would recycle them for leaf mulch!I recommend this book for any three, four and five year old children. The illustrations are bold and vivid, and the text makes for a great discussion of how we need to appreciate and preserve our natural treasures, TREES!"
4,sweet and simple,This is a nice book...it tells you about many of the reasons that trees are nice. The only part I didn't like was the part about burning leaves. Not environmentally cool.
4,Cute Read!,This cute children's book won the Caldecott award. The book is aimed toward elementary children. I would use this book for grades first and second. The theme of the book is about nature in a childrens view. The illustrations describe the story very well and will get the kids to have their own imaginations of things such as simple as trees!
3,Not the best book about trees,"This book seems very old-fashioned. The pages alternate on color and black & white. Also, it would be better if it offered some scientific reason for why trees are nice along with the whimsical, children-playing reasons."
3,Not Quite As Remembered,"This is not about the book itself. This is about this printing. Great book-as originally printed in America. This printed in China version is junk comparatively. If you want the original version, try for a used book and be specific for the printed in the USA version. I got a great copy from a Karen Thiessen.Such a shame that current buyers won't know what they are missing-paper and binding quality lacks in this version."
3,a brother loves his sister,"Well, Buddy Foster may or may not have written this book for the $$, but after reading it, despite the fact that he probably made his sister really mad at him for disclosing all the family foibles, secrets, etc., it so so apparent that this is a brother who geniunely loves his sister. I like seeing that. As a baby sister myself, I know how terrific it feels for your siblings to adore you. It's a sweet deal. I hope that by now (what is it? five years later; today is 2/14/03), Jodie fully realizes that and has forgiven Buddy. He seems like a pretty nice fellow despite his admitted faults."
3,sibling rivalties,"Like most people, i initially thought, ""oh great, i want to read about jodie, but this guy's going to spend most of the book talking about himself."" the irony is, as the book went on, i realized, his life seemed a lot more interesting than hers, and if anything, i wanted to know more about his life. Jodie's life seems more cut and dry, boring, and conservative.The first half of the book is interesting as it details how much resentment buddy holds for his mother, and colours in what we dont know about jodie's upbringing. The 2nd half of the book was slower going as it was clear buddy didnt have much interaction with his sister since the late 70's, and most of the information is filler gleaned from interviews.I spent a lot of the book thinking, man, this guy does seem to love his family, and he did seem to go out of his way to be fair and honest, but boy oh boy, for a who wants his family to be closer together, you gotta figure this book just might blow it further apart than ever."
1,transparently self-serving,"Clearly Buddy Foster didn't inherit the brains in this family! This book is packed with internal inconsistencies, factual impossibilities and, more annoyingly, long rambling sections leading nowhere. Appallingly bad bio!!"
5,"""Seemingly Interesting""","""Foster Child"" was written by Jodie Foster's brother Buddy and is in essence an unauthorized book as Jodie didn't partake in the writing of the book. Still, for anyone interested in this two-time Academy Award winning actress this is an excellent read as Jodie's brother writes about her early life, her many films in which she has appeared in, and even alludes to the fact that she is indeed gay.My favorite film of hers is 1988's ""The Accused"" in which Foster played a rape victim, probably the best such portrayal ever put on film and Buddy writes about the torment Jodie went through in filming that movie.An A+ read, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Foster Child', but I am still hoping Jodie herself will write her own memoirs someday for her fans to enjoy as she is truely one of America's greatest actresses."
1,Sadly did not work,"I have poison oak on my arms and legs right now. Have for one week now. I took these pills for two days, and it didn't do a thing for me. Oh well =("
5,"Great game, needs a little work","This game has such great potential. It has had a few problems after launch, and in all honesty, was launched early. However, the devs have worked hard to fix problems, and have fixed a LOT. This game is very enjoyable, and has so far provided me with many hours of entertainment. Hopefully, it'll provide many more.If you are looking for a shooter, this is not the game for you. Otherwise, I'd say give it a shot, and ignore all the naysayers."
3,What is this???,"I'd just like to inform people that want to buy this, that they should go directly to the main website and purchase it from them. Its fast, since you can just download it from them. And its also MUCH cheaper. You can get it for $19.95 directly from them. You can also start playing once you download it and install it and patch it up. It is MUCH easier to purchase it straight from them."
3,"Good game, bad experience.","The game concept is great, there is no doubt in it, and it is interesting and new. The only problem is, and it is a big one - the game is in very much ""wet"" condition. Those who are willing to play it right now will experience problems with connection, problem with a game play, often disconnections and constant patches. This game was obviously pushed on the market by the management, not by the developers. So it is just not finished, problems are masked but not fixed and the customers are guinea pigs."
2,Based on the beta,"I have been on the beta program and can say the followingFor: Has the potential to be a killer game. Its huge and looks stunning. It should handle 1000s of players. The highest I saw was 3600 in the beta.Against: Potential being the key. Even on the final beta I still got 100's of error dialogs per session I played and it was laggy on ISDN. The game can be slow and take ages to get around. Mining is dull because it takes too long and the market economy was not working well, not enough demand for goods. Had to exit and restart to switch between space and docking modes because the game would freeze. I never saw some features in the beta so I dont know how they can be tested. Far to buggy at the mo. Give it a month or so and then see what the community is saying about it."
1,It thinks its all that...,"This game sucks!!! I mean i could have better space combat in the spaceshuttle Endeavor! It has its wingtips cut off, machenery scrapped, engines dismanled, sitting on display at the smithsonian and has NO WEAPONS!!! There is no real concept, no reall action, no reall combat, and NO REAL PEOPLE WHO ARE HAPPY PLAYING IT!!!. EVEN THE STARBASES ARE DISAPOINTING!! THEY LOOK LIKE BASCET BALL STAIDIUMS EVEN ON THE INSIDE!!! Also the space shuttle has better responiveness. I have to wait about 2 minets between the point of moving the mouse and the point of ship movement!!! Its like buying incurance but in space combat form!!! IN reall time!!! It has good eyecandy, and cool looking spaceships, but thats all! I hate every single aspect of this game!!! Spacewar is much more fun than that horrible game and i really like to play it!! I don't know how anyone can enjoy EVE! I mean, i really would shut down the game studio that brought us this monstrosity if i had corpreat power."
4,"Good game, but still some bugs.","This is an OK game. I started it 3 days ago, with the help of my corp, I got a 300,000 game cash bonus, and a new ship to mine with. The player community is very helpful, and as long as you are in a high security space zone, you don't have to worry much about pirates. The draw down is that this game still has a lot of client bugs. The windows some times don't work right, and the ship would get lost in space, but the GM is always a good help, they can recover your ship in about 10 min. I just whish they had characters too, instead of just the ship."
5,"Good looks and brains to boot, if you asked EVE out, she'd be outta your league :)","How can I even start, graphics, sound and music will blow your mind. I was initially freaked out by how huge everything was, but the tutorial is great and the non-linear gameplay is refreshing compared to other MMORPG's that drive you into a chute like so many cattle. Since training skills is real-time based, you don't grind xp repetitively just to gain xp, you can do what you want with your game time. The economy is unlike anything I have ever seen. The society is very active, but the lack of face to face (through avatars of course) interaction leaves a little to be desired, it feels like an irc chat room. Space combat is more like land combat in a traditional MMORPG, so any flight sim junkies may not dig the turn-based combat. I found it to be fun but repetitive. The economy and freedom to do whatever you want are what makes this a surefire winner."
1,Empty of content behind the graphics,"Excessive focus on fighting, an economy that exists only to support the fighting, terrible support, and a developer team that is overly involved in playing their own game and favoring their own buddies rather than developing in a fair and impartial manner. They have been caught giving favors and cheating their own customers before. No real story to speak of as the development is only really focused on the latest way to gank someone in mindless pvp."
2,Don't bother buying this game.,The game is kind of fun. Too bad that it is riddled with many bugs. I have had the game eight days and have been unable to play it for 4 out of those eight days. Between my character getting bugged and crashing when trying to log in(support que is 12 hours long) and the downtime and even a 12 hour rollback I have recieved much more frustration than fun from this game.
2,Not yet ready for the market,"Ok, the game has a nice concept but the implementation is not yet ready for market. I was one of the beta-testers until the last day of the beta-test an can only say that the game has still immense problems like tons of exceptions, lags, crashes. There game also has some major design problems, especially that if the ship of the player gets blown up, there is no kind of an insuance for that ship. The ship is gone and all his cargo. If you are a lucky guy, you have not spend all your money for that ship otherwise you could start from the beginning with your new beginner ship.I think in 5-6 months the game is nearly ready for market, but not yet."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"Ok this has got to be the worst launch of a MMORPG to date. With character delete bugs, serverwide rollbacks, and more bugs you can count, I would definately pass this one by. This game came out WAY too early and despite the thousands of beta testers screaming to not release it, they did anyways and are paying for it now. If you are considering buying it DONT, but if you must wait atleast a few years for them to iron out the bugs."
1,"Very poor indeed, what waste of a great possibility.","Possibly the most boring online game currently out there at the moment.I started the Beta at phase 3, and during the past 6 months or so, it had become obvious that this is nothing more than an online mining simulator.The day before release, about 20mins before they turned the beta servers off, there was still at least 3 major exploits, including money dupes/item dupes and a rather nasty pvp invulnerability flaw.Do NOT buy this game (unless you like how buggy neocron is)."
1,Play Eve with your monitor turned off!!!,"There are 3 simple steps to playing Eve ""offline"".1. Tape a rock to your monitor.2. Stare at it for several hours.3. Throw $12 a month in the trash.Seriously - don't buy this game. Go to the homepage and read the forums. You know it can't be a good game when there are threads wit titles like ""What do you play while you are playing Eve?"". It's a timesink and little else."
3,We need an exterminator,"Only the god of all exterminators will be able to fish out all the creepy crawlers in this game.As many others I ve been a BETA tester for 3 weeks now, and a little dissapointed. Even opening a simple cargo container generates errors.On top is the unbalance between AI's and players. Numerous enemies, and the fact that defending yourself will take you unseen amounts of credits and not to mention patience, for training one single skill takes up to 12 hours.The tutorial is full of bugs and not very user friendly. So I do not believe this game will be very attractive for the younger players under us.Nevertheless; This is a game for me, it requieres organisation, team spirit. For those few out there, this is one of the very few games I think of as a challenge!Have fun!"
1,HOLY BETA,"half the features on the box arn't even in yet, played the game for a few months now, its full of bugs and there isn't mutch to in the game, support is a joke, and if one of those bugs effects you the standard policy is to bad. im tired of buying unfinished games and having companies expect me to pay while they finish it so i can play the game im paying for"
2,An ok base model LCD,"I initially bought an LG 15"" LCD however it had large dark spots so I swapped it for a Viewsonic VE510s.Initially I thought this had a better picture than the LG. It has excellent brightness and strong colours. However the backlighting is not constant, with an obvious dull patch covering much of the top 2cm of the screen. This is especially obvious on my Mac, as the tool bar is normally white, not gray. Another issue is the picture seems to be finely interlaced. This is only really obvious on blue background pictures and log-on screens.For the money it isn't too bad, although I wouldn't buy another one."
4,"Honest, clean green tea flavor","I view this as basic 'green tea' that comes with an assurance that it's clean and that no one had to bleed in order to meet my green tea needs.As for the Ginkgo, yes it's there and, I am happy to say, its presence does not subtract much from the familiar green tea flavor. However, I'd look for other sources if Ginkgo was what I was looking for.Overall, this is an honest product, worth trying if you are not settled to a 'favorite' brand yet and if you are okay with paper teabags. I've settled on something else but, if stranded on a deserted island where this was the only tea available I would be happy to have it."
1,Never worked right. A true piece of crap and waste of good money,Beware. I am so mad this thing never worked right after the warranty ran out. I waste over $100 on this piece of crap. I have no where to store pictures until I can find a hard drive that works.
3,"good, until warrenty ran out","We purchased one of these in May 2007 from a reputable seller of office materials. It worked wonderfully until Aug 2008. then it just stopped working. The drive didn't spin when it was turned on, it only ""clicked"". We contacted I/O Magic and the tech said the drive shouldn't click and we could try to request an RMA. I didn't get the RMA faxed till Oct 2008 (my bad) and we were told it was just too far out of warranty, despite the fact that we first contacted them only 3 months out of warranty.These are apparently very short term storage units. Be sure to back it up."
2,"hard drive OK, but enclosure failed","looks like there was something wrong with USB part of the device, b/c hard drive started, but my computer didn't recognize the device; I took out the hard drive, put into my own enclosure and it works fine."
3,"vf1 ""if you consider playability a necessary part of the experience""","for whatever reason sega couldnt get vf or vf remix to look or play like the arcade game, but hit the nail on the head with vf2 (thus i own every vf except 1 since theres no quintessential version of 1).everything in great shape, this seller is good and honest."
4,Worked great,"I ordered a used version of this game which i was iffy about because The last two times I ordered something used they didn't work at all and I had spent over a hundred dollars. And to top that off the seller wouldn't get back to me. But anyways, this game is fun for the sega I like it well enough and it works perfect. Graphics aren't that bad either for how old the system is to me."
5,Perfect for dog walks!,I got this to hold water and treats for taking walks and hiking with my dogs. It's perfect. I've never worn a fanny pack on the back before and I LOVE it! I hardly notice I'm wearing it. It also has enough pockets to keep everything separated. I couldn't be happier with it.
4,A remarkable book for baby boomers or the cognoscente.,"Steve Schindler has captured a bit of the '50s '60s and '70s that we all shared, but didn't share in quite the same way.Mr. Schindler may well be the J.D. Salinger of his generation."
3,"The product does its supposed to but,......","The DVD plays most format, but not Divx. Some how i had the impression that it did play Divx. And the description never mention that it included a microphone. The player has a simple design and feels reletivly solid for its price. But the biggest downfall of this product was the remote control. You practically have to walk infront on the unit inorder for the sensor to work. This is by far the worst remot ive seen. I had a Jwin player prior to this one, the remote was bad, but acceptable. I think they shouldve left full control on the player itself, i have to walk to it anyways."
2,cheap price with cheap quality,"This DVD Player is very slim, and the quality is not good. Even with the low price, I would still expect to get a better one."
2,"Good idea, not good fit",The drawer doesn't fit right and it is close to impossible to get it to slide out.
3,cute cheese set,"Cute and good design- knives stored inthe board. THe knives are contemporary design, soft curves on steel.Bamboo is light and hard, but we have yet to determine how water/washing will affect it in the long term."
2,Pleasantly surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this product. It was purchased as a gift, and I was a bit concerned that it was gong to look cheap, but it was a great value for the money."
3,Nice looking but quality lacking,"The set is nice looking, has fine knives but has some issues.Size wise I'd prefer a smaller cutting board. This one is pretty big so it is hard to find a storage place for it.Another issue I had with the board has to with the ball and spring mechanism that holds the knife drawer in place. The drawer tracks have on each side a hole which has spring and a ball inserted into them. These springs/balls put pressure on the drawer so it would not slide out unintentionally. After using the board few times suddenly one of the spring/ball pairs popped out of the rail. It seems that the hole is too large and cannot contain the ball. The drawer is still held by the other spring/ball pair but I have to wonder how long would this one hold before popping out."
1,Quality issues with Pinzon,"I found this cheese knife set a bit disappointing. I used it to cut three different types of cheeses - gouda, havarti, and cheddar. I had a lot of issues cutting the cheeses. The weight balance is not optimal, my hands started to fatigue and cramp, b/c the knives provided poor leverage and did not cut through well. Even though I washed off the knives before use, they left a silver residue on the cheese discoloring them - yecch. To top it all off, they rusted at certain spots after I washed them. I do like the drawer feature so I can hide them out of sight and just use the cutting board. I will probably have them sharpened and repurposed for something other than cheese."
4,hidden knives,I love my cheese board - I keep it oiled with olive oil. I bought several as gifts and they were very well received. The whole thing is of the highest quality.
3,Underwhelming,"Ok knives. Cutting board is quite nice. Knives are of only average quality. Seem a little dull for brand new, but seem durable enough."
3,review,ball bearings are a little tight so the drawer does not slide open smoothly. Hard to open. cutting board looks good knives work good.
5,I laughed out loud!,"This is one book I loved reading to my children, over and over. I laughed out loud each time. There are two separate stories in the book. In ""Hamburgers, Hamburgers"" Tom turns his little furry nose up at Mother's suggestion that spring is the time to eat dandelions. He wants a hamburger ""with onions and ketchup and pickles on a poppy-seed roll."" Mother Rabbit wishes she had a nickel for every pickle Tom eats, and says his head is full of ketchup. I can't help myself; I giggle. It's an adorable story with an ending your kids will love. In ""Tom's Pet"" our friend Tom tries to bring home several different pets, only to be told by Mother that he cannot keep them. Cute ending to this one, too."
5,"Great Book, Sure to be a Favorite","I grew up making my grandmother read this book to me over and over again. Tom's desire for a hamburger with ""onions and ketchup and pickles on a poppy-seed roll"" is equal to many desires of all children."
5,Love this book!,"This was one of my favorite books as a child, and Im so excited that I was able to find a copy and order it for when I have children."
5,MST3K = complete in awesomeness!,"Awesome CD, it has the 2 best themes of all time!!!Alfred Hitchcock presents, and Mystery Science Theater 3000!!It is a must! :)"
3,Cool CD,"This CD was really cool, however, I bought it because I thought the ""Forever Knight"" selection might have the words Lacroix says at the begining of every episode. It doesn't. It's got the same theme from the Soundtrack. The rest was really good though, except the one disappointment."
2,disappointment,This wasn't what I expected. It was all questions and answers but not a how to guide which is what I thought I would be getting. If you are getting into the dating scene I think it would be very helpful.
4,No nonsense,"A nice collection of selected questions and answers to the age-old quest for romance and passion. The occasional side-bar ""the Secrets of Long-Lasting Marriage"", ""the Man Who Invented Sex"", among others, were a nice break in the Q&A format. Not specifically a ""how-to"" as much as an encouraging word for those looking to get back into the dating/romance scene."
2,Its different than what I had received on another order,"I liked the first PL bee pollen lip balm I had received in another order. This product is different and has a bad flavor the color is also different.My first lip balm was cream in color this one was white. I really did not like this lip balm, I would rather have the first lip balm."
1,Death is not funny to me.,"Imagine a book about a man who, in the midst of eating dinner with his family, suffers a cardiac infarction, is rushed to the hospital for emergency bypass surgery, and dies there as his adult-age children wait outside. Funny, right? Well, not when it happened to a neighbor of mine. He was an executive with an accounting firm and quite a good card player as I recall. Anyway, the world is full enough of things to make fun of without adding ""impending death"" to the list. It is possible this book was not intended to be funny but rather to be a collection of poignant observations on death and dying; but I don't believe it for a second, Mr. Fulghum. I urge one and all not to buy this most dangerous book."
2,The Manual Is Better,"""Dreamweaver 4: The Missing Manual"" is a good guide for beginners, but what I expected was the opposite, a guide for advanced users. I thought it would contain information _missing_ from the official manual. Instead, it contains less information than the manual."
4,The Missing Manual Misses..,"As a HTML/CSS freak that had enough of FP and migrated to DW, this book provided plenty assistance, and I would recommend it to other novice users that are willing to learn DW. However I must point out my dissapointment that there was no coverage of SSI(server side includes) what so all, and it's misleading concept of the Library/Template function. Yes, the ""update library items"" updates your site in one click indeed---the local site, that is. Considering the uploading one has to deal with(not to mention the dreadful DW FTP) AFTER the local site is fully effected, this is definetly not what I could 'sit back and smile' at. Otherwise, nice book."
4,"Sexy, hilarious, and surprising","""A comedy about a sex addiction therapy group"" is a pretty solid elevator pitch. I was intrigued from the start, and when I saw the leads included Odette Annable, whose performance I so thoroughly enjoyed on Breaking In, and Greg Grunberg, who was one of the highlights of Heroes, I was sold. This movie is delightful, unique, and heartfelt in its portrayal of a bunch of perverts who are making some effort to change, and whose therapy group codependency both strengthens and weakens them at times. There are so many truly hilarious moments in this movie, and the characters won me over completely. While they play for laughs certainly, they aren't sacrificing the reality of the human interaction at the heart of the story. I watched it once and knew it was one I wanted to own. A second viewing a year later confirmed that this is a gem of a film I'm glad to have discovered."
5,Excellent. Funny. Entertaining.,"I do not see any way that someone could call this movie anything but excellent.The humor 'is' sex related and 'is' rude, but is funny as ****. Underlying the rude humor is a very good love story."
3,"Yes, but... so what?","I can absolutely see why the illustrations won the Caldecott medal -- John Schoenherr's watercolors are vivid and fine. The illustrtions stand alone and can tell a story even without the words.It's a good thing the words in this book are superfluous, because they are singularly bland and tell a story that is uninteresting and unmemorable. ""Be quiet outdoors at night"" is the summary my son gave this story. As an adult, I think the free-verse poetry is just ok, some nice turns of phrase, some good metaphors/similes, but nothing remarkable.But whoa! These illustrations!Let your children tell their own story, based on the illustrations."
5,Both Story and Art Enchant,"I like this book and so do my children. Although it will have more appeal to fathers and sons, any parent and child can enjoy this story of the magical bond that takes place when a parent introduces their child to one of life's moments of wonder.Who among us doesn't remember wonderful moments when you and you alone were the focus of your father's (or mother's) attention in a special setting that created a life-long memory pleasently returned to again and again. That's the magic of Owl Moon where a little boy takes a long walk in the woods over new fallen snow with his father. They are journeying to, as his older brothers had done before him, find a great owl, if he can be coaxed from his high above throne where he rules the night.The story is simply told but carries all of the magic foretold by the setting. The water color illustrations are beautiful in their simplicity and convey the wonder of nature and the togetherness of father and son."
5,Teacher's Favorite,"I love this book! It has also been loved by my pre K students every year. I always look forward to reading it to my class and I can't say that about a lot of preschool literature. This story takes my suburban kids on an adventure that, unfortunately, many of them will never experience. It's educational, exciting, and a little spooky (but not too much). Don't hesitate to add it to your collection."
5,My All Time Favorite,"OWL MOON is my favorite book... but I have to admit that I am far from unbiased. I am the little girl in this book, my father is ""Pa"" and my mother is Jane Yolen, the author. I have always loved this story, even before it was a book, because it is the story of my childhood with my real life bird watching father. Now, as a mother, it is even more special since I read it to my 3 year old daughter Maddison Jane. Last month, Maddison went, for the first time, into our back yard with my Dad and called to the owls with him. Thank you Mommy for writing this book. Thank you Daddy for teaching me about birds and all of nature. And thank you both for sharing this story with all readers."
4,Revisit when my son is 4,"He liked the book alot, but only when I read it with alot of inflection in my voice - especially whispering to emphasize quiet while owling. The book is lovely but the prose is a little long on each page for my 3 year old to really take in."
5,Owl Moon,I was very happy with each copy of Owl Moon that I ordered. I received the books within the time promised.
1,"Bland, Boring","Recommended my sister get this for our three young children as a Christmas present. She recorded herself on CD reading the story, putting a photo of her inside the cover, so all in all a nice gift, but the story itself is so incredibly bland and boring. I love simple stories that leave much to the imagination but this one is just dull, drab writing."
4,Charming Father Daughter Story,Sometimes hard to find a nice story with father daughter characters (most so geared to mothers). But this is a charming one and my husband appreciates it.Only drawback is that my daughter is particularly found of action stories with more scary characters so sometimes hard to keep her interested. But I know she listens because she often brings up lines from the book while walking in the woods...
3,"Maybe I missed it, but I thought I was purchasing a new copy and it arrived used.","Maybe I missed it, but I thought I was purchasing a new copy and it arrived used. I don't know if there is a way to check after the fact. This book however, is highly recommendable--a wonderful story, perfect for winding down and gathering up peacefulness."
5,Children love this Book,"My 4 yr. old loves this book! Even though he doesn't read, that doesn't stop him from poring over the pictures in between having it read to him."
5,Writing assistance,"This is a great book to start the writing process. It has great examples of sentence stucture changes and show, not tells the story."
5,What a treasure!,"This is a truly delightful book. When I bought it for my (then 26-month son) some months back, he found it ""too scary"" - the idea of walking in the woods at night was a little much for him, I think. However, after several months passed he asked that I read him the book again, and now can't get enough of it. He sits riveted as we learn how the child in the book goes owling with her father, just as her brothers had in the past. We learn that one needs to be both quiet and brave when you go owling, and that words don't need to be spoken to relay the excitement that one feels when owling. Best of all is the way my son lets out a gasp of excitement when at last we see the owl. This is a beautifully illustrated book and a wonderfully told story. A treasure for nature-loving children of many ages."
3,"Review of "" Owl Moon ""","Book arrived with torn jacket, story was good for young child. I guess I expected more on the new side.All in all the purchase was good."
5,celtic toasting glasses,"The glasses are beautiful. I ordered them for my daughters wedding and I needed them rushed. that shipping wasn't available so I contacted the seller and they got them to me immediately, no extra charge. I would definitely recommend these glasses and this seller."
2,Returned,"I ordered these for my St Patrick's Day weekend wedding. They were very light and just ribbons glued to the flute with a charm. I think anyone could dyi the same effect. I went with Waterford crystal instead. More money, but elegant and Irish!"
1,Did not received this book,"I never receive this item that i purchased, even though it was billed to my account, therefore i will not be able to rate this item, and this is the second time that this happened, I am very disappointed. I purchased three books and I only received two, i never received the Making Arguments About Literature:A Compact Guide and Anthology. Could you please look into this for me?"
4,Great College Textbook,"I purchased this book for a college class, and I actually enjoy reading it. It has several works of literature in it, also."
3,"Oh, it's FICTION.","And I thought it would be a wonderful non-fiction book about the life of a farmer. It may, indeed, still be a good read. I just can't read fiction... anymore."
1,Couldn't even finish it,"With the disclaimer that I refused to invest any more of my life in the completion of this book, I have to say that this is among the worst books that I've never read. I was attracted to it because of (i) Rhodes' reputation, and (ii) the legacy of, and current connection to, farming in my own family. My intimate familiarity with farming (see note ii above) might have made me more sympathetic to, or perhaps more critical of, this book - I don't know. Anyway, I found it to be flat and uninspired. Perhaps it is a good read for someone who has never, ever stepped foot on a farm. However, I think that listening to an ag report on the radio would be just as informative, and about as interesting."
4,Just great !,Well i just want to said that i can listento this CD for a thousands times and i never get tired of to it.
3,"Good, overall coverage",This book is relative if you are using MSMQ or MQSeries. There is also a chapter regarding using both of these messaging products together. This book will get you 'up and running'. The concepts of messaging are nicely explainedAs the book was published in Dec 1999 I would have expected more coverage of MSMQ 2.0 and code samples in Java or C++. The author uses C for the examples! This actually makes the code samples more complex - such as the use of static local variables rather than private members.
2,Should be titled: Beginning Messaging Applications with ....,"This book is a nice introduction to MQ-Series, however, is no way advanced. It just touches the basic concepts but goes either very little or nothing into channels, clusters, distribution lists, threading, transactions, and so-forth. I skipped the chapters on MSMQ, so i can't say much about that section."
3,Better at form than at free verse,"Jared Carter's second collection shows him growing more and more comfortable writing as a formal poet. There are stanzas that show the control of great contemporary formalists like Hollander is Wilbur. While none of his poems as a whole reach that stature, he seems well on his way.It is when he turns to free verse that he seems to stumble. Rather than finding it liberating, he oftens seems to lose his rhythm, have trouble determining where to break lines ... in other words, he has the same problem all but the best free verse poets have. Not that he is asking, but if he asked me, I'd tell him to stick to formal verse. I would similarly recommend this book to people who enjoy neoformalism."
1,"More contemporary, regionalist pablum...","Well, here we go with another minor poet. Can Carter write decently? Yes. Can he project his voice beyond the derivitive clones that permeate modern poetry? No.His recent background is respectable enough. A couple of minor awards. A hefty catalogue of printed poetry, a modest and vocal following. The problem is his choice of subject matter. While regional poetry (in this case Indiana) may seem aw-shucks down-home and interesting to those of us in the more urban of locations, Carter still fails to deliver on a sense of ""worldliness"". His verse seems contrived, and each piece reads as if he were valiantly fighting to achieve that higher level of writing you'd expect from a national poet. Then it dissipates. It leaves you scratching your head and wondering why he was incapable of taking it further.Read it for its curiosity. But I would recommend spending your money on the poetry of Seamus Heaney or Robert Bly."
3,"Good book, bad title / [...]","The title of this book is not appropriate , because when you read thisbook, you will find very interesting tips , but the tips are verygeneral.If you hope to find technical draws, or tips to modify your mini youcannot.. Otherwise the book is very ilustrated, but only according toimproveyour car, maybe a new title for this book might be for example, ""BillSollis, and his mini"", or "" the race mini of Bill"") .I hope you consider this observations, in order to give a buyers andusersmore accurate and reliable information.Regards,[...]"
4,The Long Lost Hits of Perry Como,"If you enjoy easy listening 40's and 50's music, then this alblum is for you."
3,Como is a superior middle of the road pop singer...,"This is a hophodge collection put together by Collector's choice Music, which sometimes does a good job with re-issues, however there are more complete sets available, and les commercial then this. Why doesn't Collectors Choice re-issue what the collectors really want instead of the dumb middleo f the road pop tunes on this CD, which are already easily available. Collectors Choice needs to re-issue the jazz vocal classic Perry Como's ""We Get Letters"" which features Como backed by a small jazz combo singing jazz standards, without the annoying background singers. This CD is better then most domestic releases, but still his best stuf was his LP's for RCA and his sides with Ted Weems' in the 30's, not his later singles. This CD recomended only as an introduction to the more commercial side of Como, and it prooves that some middle of the road pop is bearable."
1,just bored me,boring andi hate seeing how movies are made i like to be surprised when im going to watch a movie
1,waist,not that big of a deal. I was hoping for more. some behind the scenes stuff and interviews but nothing great.
3,In Search of Zombieland,Short vignette on the making of the movie. Nothing really new here but could be interesting if you really want to know more.
4,Fun for a promotional piece but not something worth having on Amazon.,"I am not sure why anyone would care to see this video on Amazon. It is something I would expect to see on YouTube. That said, it is one of the better promotional pieces I have seen. It is fun to watch because of the jokes, and it is always fun to see actors and actresses outside of their roles, talking about why they like those roles, and agreeing with everything they say. Ha. I loved the Zombieland movie, and that is why I watched this video. I do not think a review is even necessary! XD"
4,Fitting end to a great series,"I love this show and I watch it over and over again. The Reunion Special, however, is the weakest link in the chain. Dame Judith Dench is brilliant and energetic but the rest of the cast looks tired. The energy that made the show so brilliant is lacking. Still, if you are a fan of the show, this is a must see."
5,Like an old friend...,It was like seeing an old friend that you haven't seen for a while. I wish Jean and Lionel and the rest could last forever. It is such a wonderful show. Kudos to them all.
5,As Time Goes By,We have watched the whole series over the winter and have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.
5,As Time Goes By Gets Better with Time,"This is a wonderful review of a terrific program. The acting is superb, the script is a riot, and I recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed the series."
5,"If you're a fan, this is a must!","One of my favorite all-time shows. I have the entire series and watch them all the way through once a year. This special is a perfect ending, if it had to end."
5,My dad's favorites,Bought as gift for elderly father just loves this show....It is most definitely my father's favorite series....Wish there was more would have gotten them...thanks
4,As Time Goes By - Reunion Special,"We have enjoyed the 'As time Goes By"" series for quite a few years and watch them over and over again. This Renion Special was very good and I hope they make another one. You get acoustom to the people in the parts and would like it to continue. I know, thats not the way life really is, however but my wife and I really enjoy watching the complete series over and over."
5,The Best Gets Better,"Product exceeds my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product. I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase. I keep watching this over and over."
5,More Time Goes By - as before,"This series reunion is very satisfying. It has the same gentle tenor of the long running series with all the same characters but one (Sandy's beau, now husband, Harry played by Daniel Ryan in place of David Michaels). The two episodes are both engaging and leave open the possibility of yet another reunion. I rather hope a final reunion is filmed before the world loses yet another cast member since both Joan Sims (Madge) and Frank Middlemass (Rocky) have been lost. Perhaps a return to the Hardcastle estate showing the couple in true retirement in the country surrounded by their country friends, and family - including grand children."
4,Time really has gone by,"I followed this BBC series throughout its run and have seen it from begining to end at least three times on PBS. I had always missed the reunion shows so was glad to see it.One of the funniest comedies ever recorded for TV. Too bad american tv does not present stuff like this. Although not in HD like most DVD's, the quality is still very good."
5,Great reunion to fantastic show,"We have the show on DVD, so this was an opportunity to complete the show. Judi Dench is fantastic as always and the others contribute perfectly to a great ensemble cast. We've watched the entire thing through once and seen episodes since. Definitely worth the price which was reasonable to begin with."
5,Superb!!,Outstanding acting. Wonderfully funny British dry humor. Geoffrey Palmer as Lionel Hardcastle and Dame Judy Dench as Jean Pargeter are perfectly cast and pefect in their roles. The is clearly the finest TV comedy series ever made!
1,Delivery time,"Product just received but substantially delayed. I am disappointed that Amazon did not arrange a faster method of shipment than what was originally requested, to ensure a fast receipt by customer, since delay was the fault of Amazon."
2,Omron HEM - 705CP Auto Print-Out Blood Pressure Monitor,This monitor consistently shows sitolic blood pressure far above (20 to 30 mm. of mercury) that what is taken by a trained health care operator manually. The consecuences of this inconsistence could severely affect patients treatment and follow up. It's a waste of money in an inaccurate device.
3,OMRON BP MONITOR,"I'VE USED OMRON BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORS FOR YEARS. THAT IS WHY I BOUGHT THIS ONE. THE PRINTING ONE I HAD THEY DIDN'T MAKE PAPER FOR IT ANYMORE.THIS ONE WORKS OK, BUT WON'T PRINT OUT THE MEASURE MENTS !!!THIS IS NOT A GOOD ADVERTISEMENT FOR THEM NOW.ON THEIR WEB SITE I SEE THEY DON'T OFFER A PRINTING MONITOR ANY MORE.THIS ONE IS GOING BACK FOR REPAIR."
3,This version is actually playable!,"I tried the sega cd and 32x versions of this game and they were both unplayable. This one has the video enlarged and its more clear to see the footage. This one also doesnt suffer the sluggish slowdown when you shoot the zombies and there are also more variety of enemies and power ups. Overall, I finally enjoyed playing this game for the saturn."
2,A good introduction but professional developers beware.,"If you are looking for a good introduction to using XML with Java then this is as good as any other but over half the book uses third-party libraries which exist outside the standards (JDK, SAX and DOM) and therefore if you are writing code for commercial purposes this is not much use.What I wanted from the book was an explanation of issues such as using RMI and RPC to transfer XML data. What I got was whole chapters on using a library which might (but does not) achieve what I want. After an explanation of the SAX and DOM APIs the authors then introduce their alternative API which is then used through the book. At the same time the authors criticise Microsoft for not following the standards!!!In addition a number of O'Reilly books I have purchased in the last year suffer from poor binding quality; my copy of this has started falling apart within a week of purchase."
2,Flawed Writing Mars Otherwise Fine Effort,"I tried sitting down and reading this book, and I got to about page 75. Then I tried using it as a reference, and I got nowhere.This book undoubtedly has many nuggets of information, but unfortunately they are scattered throughout tons of manure (words). Devoid of useful figures and tables, this book is words words words words words words, a little code, repeat. It's not uncommon for the poor reader to have to plow through page after page of nothing but words.If I want a novel, I'll go with Hemingway; if I want a technical book, I want to be able to skim through it and use it as a reference. Neither of those are possible with this book."
1,Bottom rung,"As previous reviewers have pointed out, this book succeeds at nothing more than being a sales pitch for JDOM. In fairness, XML is so large and in such a state of flux that it's difficult for any book to do it justice, but this title certainly isn't the best that can be done. Yes, the Wrox book is pretty bad, but this one isn't much better. As for JDOM being accepted as a JSR by Sun, do you suppose that has anything to do with Jason Hunter (one of JDOM's creators) being recently elected to the JCP executive committee for J2EE?Let's see: no reviews for a month, and then three five-star reviews appear within two days time, one of which describes the negative reviews on here as ""misleading"". Wow, what a . . . coincidence for three of them to show up at once. Do you feel a little like Dorothy being told to ""pay no attention to that man behind the curtain""?"
1,An Oreilly title...,"I usually buy Oreilly books without much thought, but my past two experiences have me reevaluating my blind faith.This book is patronizing (assumes that the reader has to hand held all the way) and could have been half as thick. There is took little of conceptual understanding and too much silly code which do nothing to explain. Any half competent java programmer can read javadoc and figure out how to use the classes. The part that needs to be explained in the conceptual stuff, which he just glazes over..."
2,Pretty much a waste of time,"Now, after having had this book for about 1 year, and having looked at other sources which explain XML and using XML with Java, do I realize how much of my time this book has wasted.The author might be a genius, but if you wish to learn XML and it's usage with Java, please take my advise and stay away from this book.The book is too verbose and the author in the process, to give him the benefit of doubt, forgot to explain the concepts, and then wandered off to his favorite specialized topics such as JDOM and other usages of XML which may be of interest to just a few readers."
1,"Get the second edition, not this one",Readers should note that the second edition will be available in a week or two; you can pre-order it elsewhere on this site (my rating is meaningless by the way... its just the review system insists you give it a rating...). Posted 22nd August 2001.
2,XML and JDOM,"I was disappointed after I bought and read this book. I bought this book as a lot of people gave it a five star. I was working on a project using Apache Xerces xml parser and/or SUN's xml parser. This book was not very helpful. The book covers a lot in XML and JDOM parser. It only covers DOM and SAX parser very little. I had to figure out a lot of problems by using on-line documentation and samples. The worst thing about the book is the ad on the back of the book. It says that it covers DOM and SAX. It does cover these topics!!! The correct title for the book should be XML and JDOM. I gave this book a two star as I hate the misleading title and ad on the back of the book. If you buy the book for XML or JDOM, this is a book for you. I don't suggest you buying this book for DOM and SAX."
2,JDOM for XML,"The title ""Java and XML"" is misleading, because the whole book relies on JDOM. If you want use other main stream API for XML, this is not the book. Since 90 percent of this book is related to JDOM, I think ""JDOM for XML"" is a better title for this book.If your project is not using JDOM API, you can gain nothing from the book."
3,Good but needs to be compacted.,"The author seemed very knowledgeable.The author takes a high level approach. He talks about numerous acronyms in the vaguest of terms only much later refining and giving details. It comes off sounding like ad copy. Very broad, not enough depth. Also spends a lot of time talking about what direction he is going, i.e. ""from this point onward we will focus on ..."". I found this really irritating."
2,"Is this book for ""JDOM"" publicity?","I bought this book having read the raving reviews and that it is from o'reilly.What I found was that it covers ""could be"" and ""may be"" APIs that are used to extensively in the book. Some cases in point are: JDOM api - which is still in beta form and DOM level 2 - which is not yet adopted with confidence to write production level applications.I was expecting that the author would discuss writing applications using popularly used ""industry standard"" APIs. This is not to say JDOM and DOM level 2 are not promising, but not yet!"
1,Acronym glossary expanded into a book.,"Of all XML books found in bookstores in 2000-08 this was the only one that invited me to explore it beyond the table of contents. It promised some useful technical information. After flipping pages from cover to cover my impression is that XML is a giant alphabet soup designed by committee(s) that I should stay away from, at least until I catch a better glimpse of some reality behind the hype. There are sections that look like examples of code but I was not convinced they are. An author is also among the developers of JDOM, one of the XML Document Object Models mentioned. He apparently has the technical understanding of the subject but the book does not pass that to me. It reads like a long marketing novel. One star, just like on the book cover."
2,Good Intent,"The book starts well and, like a star, gives some hope to a genre that has become somewhat burned out. However this star is short-lived. I soon felt the distinct feeling of being trapped in a room listening to a senile old man ramble on about some make-shift history lesson. A possibly superb notion has once again been twisted and corrupted by attention to unimportant detail and loss of focus. It's a shame, really."
1,Aerosmith? IN A GAME!!!,"First off I am a very big fan of Aerosmith but this game is stupid. Ok heres the plot Evil No fun terrorists ban the world of fun of any kind. Unfortunently they kidnapped Aerosmith. So you nameless action hero who shoots stuff with a gun must protectand save Steven Tyler,Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton and that other guy whos completley useless Brad Whitford. Now heres what gets me instead of kidnapping a world leader of anything political they get a rock group. If the leader were to go to the Bomb terrorist bar he wouldnt fit in. Heres a sample.Liquid Snake: I kidnapped two nuclear missile company presidents forced them to cooaperrate and made a demand of 1billion dollars what did you do over the weekend.Revo. X: I kidnapped Aerosmith and did nothing.See it makes no sense. Its a good thing Nameless Guy who shoots big gun stopped them before they caught AC/DC."
4,Great CD,"First off, I love the Dark Tower series. I am not normally a big fan of new age music, although I love video game music so I guess it goes. Anyway, this is a very mellow, but beautiful collection. 'Ka Like A Wind' is my personal favorite, and 'Crossing Over', which opens the CD, is also wonderful. All tracks have a unique feel to them.I recommend this CD to anyone who likes the DT series. While not an official soundtrack, each track captures the essence of the subject in its title (in my imagination at least!)"
4,Wonderfully Unfortunate,"This album is held to a higher scrutiny than perhaps it deserves, simply because the artist has set the terms for it being the ""soundtrack"" to the Dark Tower series. Because of that the music is partially judged on how well it fits the story; I am guilty of this along with some of the other reviewers.On its own, the songs are great--from relaxing to inspirational to ominous--comparable to anything on the Final Fantasy game soundtracks by Nobuo Uematsu. Having said that, the electronic style of ""Territories"" does not fit the ""feel"" of the DT stories, which were much more raw and earthy. If the same songs were simply played by a live band, it might be more appropriate for Stephen King's works.This is a great album if you are, like I, a roleplayer in need of background music for a fantasy/medeival game. It's just not the soundtrack that it says it is."
2,too new agey - hard to listen to twice.,I was hoping for a cross between the Good Bad and the Ugly Sountrack and something mystical. This is neither but rather a strange blend of insipid and disconnected.The books deserve something much better!
3,Review of Coby Sport Radio,The product has decent sound and was inexpensive. The only problem is the radio does not stay secure to the arm band holder. There's got to be a better way to attach and secure it.
4,pumice works very well but how do I clean it when done?,"Just used it for the first time. Was expecting to have to scrub and scrub but wonderfully the dry skin came right off. The only thing is, how do I clean the pumice after I'm done?"
2,A bit disappointed,"I was excited to receive this because I had read all the good reviews, but I'm disappointed. It's made of what seems like purple styrafoam and creates quite a mess when using it. It didn't make any noticeable difference in my heels at all. I'll be ordered an actual pumice STONE to replace this."
1,Bad Product,I bought this to remove palm calluses from weightlifting. This pumice bar would fall apart when used and did nothing to remove calluses. I tossed it.
1,Not quite what I expected.,I definitely didn't like this pumice as much as my others. It falls apart with purple pieces going all over and doesn't quite get my hand callous off the way the other pumices i've had.
2,Not what I expected.,"Like another reviewer, I was hoping for a stone bar, and this is just rough styrofoam that turns into a giant dust mess if you attempt to use it. My fault for not reading the description closely, since I bought this rather fast just to go with another order. Went right in the trash."
5,Love...,"Love these! There is a little bit of grit that comes off of the stone when you use it, but it's the best thing I've found to keep my feet soft!"
2,Don't like it.,This product breaks too easily and wears out after several uses. A good portion of it falls off every time you use it.
3,Fine then,It's like 300 grit sand paper. I need to rip dead skin away faster. Good for women. Can't beat the price!
4,"Pillows, Cushions and Tuffets",This was a great book to get ideas and techniques to make all those little extra decorating details. Photos were excelent. The details on how to sew like a pro. made the book worth it.
2,For mature readers only...,"My recommendations if you must read ""The Message"":1) Read with a mature Christian2) Always read side-by-side with a real translation3) Use as a study aid, not a Bible4) Do not use for memorizationA paraphrase is a restatement of a text in different words, hopefully to clarify the meaning of the original. Although ""The Message"" succeeds at this in a number of places, it fails in far too many--either to clarify or to restate the original meaning.Having said the above...I do believe that the author created this work with good faith and intent. He is a good writer with a flair for the poetic, which I appreciate. His ""take"" on some passages has led me to research them in the original texts and reflect on them further, which certainly benefits me.As I said, my recommendation, if you are going to use ""The Message,"" is to use it with great care."
5,Anyway you putit-it's the good book!!!,Very easy reading version. I love the practical language. It goes straight to the core of the issue. God's loyal people should read it.
3,A little disappointed,"I was hoping to be able to listen to these cd's in my car, but unfortunately, because of the mp3 format, they will not play on any cd player that I have with the exception of my Bose. They are beautifully written and wonderfully read, but I am a little disappointed that I can only listen to them at home."
4,Format,It is a nice portable size. Please note that the paper is thin and the words on the other side show through.
5,Buy this book!,"For me, buying this book is one of the best investments I've ever made. This paraphrase really brings the Bible to life, and makes God's word hit home in a way like never before. If you're interested in reading the Bible for the first time, or just looking for a new translation to enjoy in your daily reading this is the book. (""The Message"" is not a study Bible, so if you're trying to really dig deep on an issue then you will want to use a NIV or King James even.)Anyway, I can't say enough about this book. I regard it as a treasure, and highly recommend it to anyone considering buying it."
4,A Great Interpretation...,"Peterson's take on the scriptures is a refreshing change from the New International Version, which has become the sliced bread of Biblical translations. Whether you're leading a study, or just digging in on your own, The Message reads like a narrative, and the characters, movements, themes, and truths come alive. Forget all the debate and hoopla about whether or not The Message is a viable version of the Bible and enjoy it for what it is. It will surely paint a new dimension of spiritual truth for anyone who comes in contact with it. Also, dig the new cover design."
3,mixed review,"It arrived towards the deadline of the when it was due. The pages are really thin!!!I opened the package to find that some of the pages were folded and crumpled up, but to be fair, that could have been due to the handling.the content was what i expect so that was the good part."
1,Corrupting the word of God,"As A.W. Tozer noted in The Menace of the Religious Movie: ""The temptation to introduce 'new' things into the work of God has always been too strong for some people to resist. The Church has suffered untold injury at the hands of well intentioned but misguided persons who have felt that they know more about running God's work than Christ and His apostles did.A solid train of boxcars would not suffice to haul away the religious rubbish which has been brought into the service of the Church with the hope of improving on the original pattern. These things have been, one and all, positive hindrances to the progress of the Truth, and have so altered the divinely-planned structure that the apostles, were they to return to earth today, would scarcely recognize the misshapen thing which has resulted."
3,"enlightning, but not reliable",The message can be very enjoyable as it puts the Scriptures into comtemporary spoken language. Sometimes it speaks the Word of God in a way that is much easier to understand. Sometimes it departs from the original intention.I would recommend to never consider it a Study Bible. Read it second as a way to look for clarification.A good thought for thought translation which is easy to understand and more faithful to the original language is the New Century Version.
5,Very easy to understand,I love that this is so much easier to understand than the NIV or KJV. I am a mother and my reading time usually is late at night. We all know how fried we are by the end of the day and trying to decipher some of the older translations of the bible are not easy at 12 am. This reads more like a story and is written in modern language. Bought it for both of my younger brothers for Christmas.
4,Speaks to the present generation,"I truly love The Message as it communicates to me God's Word in a way like never before. While I love the NIV and the NLT, the message of Scripture is just fresh and has new meaning because of Eugene Petersen's translation. So thankful!"
2,Just FYI very small print,"I just received my copy, and was so excited to read it. Unfortunately the print is very small and the paper is so thin that you see the words on the following page which makes it even more difficult to read. I am returning it and hopefully exchanging it for a larger print version. Just for sizing info, the text is much smaller the normal print on a bible or novel would be. If you're comfortable with very compact bible small type it should be fine. I'm still looking forward to reading it."
2,Disappointed but not with seller,I was so excited to see this item for mp3 player but was not able to get product to play.
1,BLASPHEMY!,"this is NOT a Bible. its a book about what some guy thinks is a Bible.worthless. dont bother reading this book. go read a REAL Bible, KJV!!!!!ps. i HAD to give this at least one star. it doesnt deserve one."
5,Fresh insights to the Bible,"Peterson's easy-to-read paraphrase brings new life and a fresh perspective to the Holy Bible, often expressing subtle meanings from the original languages not captured in a traditional word-for-word translation. It is especially suited for reading aloud.The Message presents Biblical text in everyday English in a paragraph format that is anything but ""churchy"" sounding. This Remix version also has traditional verse numbering in the margins so you can more easily pinpoint exact Scriptural references."
3,new and updated,"The print is small, and the paper they printed it on doesn't seem kind to your eyes, but for younger people it would be great I am sure. The version is different for us older folks, but I wanted to try something new this year in my reading the bible through. I try a new version each year so this year it was this one. It reads more like a novel then a bible, the verses are to the side not in the actual reading, which I like better as it flows easier. The version itself is different, and I find myself smiling in some of the terms they use. I think it would be great for younger people and for someone who is a new Christian. I find I have read it faster just because of the way it flows."
4,Great Figure,The figure has great articulation and strong joints. Limbs won't go loose too quickly. But the face isn't too attractive. Maybe it would have been better if they had gone with an anime look.The toy is great to mod into other characters.
4,Psylocke Marvel Legends,"A good looking figure, one of the better renditions of Betty Braddock. Mine is NRFB, so I'm not sure how it stands up to being played with or posed. Still like it!"
2,Presenting XML,"The book has some good information for the new and novice user. Unfortunately, you have to filter through too much to get at them. On several occasions, I had a sense of deja vu because the author decided to repeat a concept covered multiple times earlier in the book.I don't consider it a total waste of money because I did complete it and feel I learned something. However, if you have some experience with HTML or XML, spend your money elsewhere."
2,A lot of writing but not too much is said.,"I've only read 4 chapters so far on this book. But, it has been extremely painful! I will probably press on, but this is definitely snooze material!"
1,Ouch.,"Briefly: this book is dry, repetetive, and way too light on code samples that should help reinforce key concepts.Just walk right past this one."
2,Better than most but still not very good,"Unfortunately, many of todays xml books have been 'rushed to the presses' and are of very poor quality. This book is better than most I've read/seen but I was still disappointed. I forced myself through the first five chapters and finally quit around chapter 7. The opening chapters seem to fluctuate between a managerial overview and a detailed how-to book, accomplishing neither. I also felt that there was a severe lack of real-world examples / applications. I was glad that I checked it out from the library instead of buying it."
3,Good but dated book.,"This book is very good if you have no clue what XML is, however it has now become dated with many of the developments in XML standardization. I highly suggest it for a general overview, but take into account that some of what you read is no longer true. There really isn't much choice though since there aren't very many books on XML (yet)."
1,Poorly written books,"Very badly organized and hard to follow writting styles. If you are technical enough, just go to w3 website to learn XML, because this book does not provide anything easier to understand (if not more confusing) than the pure specifications."
1,Don't by!,I am VB/SQL/HTML/JavaScript programmer. Worst computer book I ever red in my life. I would rate it without any star.
3,"Noel Coward Sings ""Sail Away"" and Other Coward Rarities?","Interesting, but not what I'd expected. I'd hoped this would be a crisp new pressing of the Coward LP of this show's score. Instead, it's a different set of recordings, made at another time under less than ideal studio conditions. Still, for Coward afficionados, worth having, and the liner notes are copious and excellent. The ""bonus"" selections are also of interest. The packaging, however, was poor; the disc in its jewel case arrived in a slightly reinforced envelope. Although the disc was undamaged, the jewel case was badly cracked and chipped. Very annoying considering the cost."
2,Complicated to put together!!!,"Product looks good, but comes in a million pieces with a million decal stickers. Daughter is 3, but isn't very interested in the castle, is more interested in the horse and carriage. Dolls are very cute, but rooms and floors in the castle don't have any room to put furniture in or to play with the dolls in."
1,"TOO FRAGIL FOR A ""TOY""","This toy looks good sitting but nothing stays together for a child to play. Bed folds down on a flimsy plastic ""leg"" and the steps to upstairs don't hook to anything, just falls over. Horse and carriage were bonus' and the horse won't even stand up; legs fall flat out. Was a big disappointment and frustrating for child."
3,Not a very good quality,"We ended up getting this for very very cheap due to a sale, so it's ok, but if I would have paid full price for it I would have been very disappointed. The castle is very cheap flimsy plastic and you have to put a million little stickers on yourself. I do like the dolls that came with ours, and the horse and carraige, though the carraige is very cheap to and parts fall off and have to be put back on all the time. I would never pay the full $90 for it. Our daughter does love it though, she is 3 1/2."
1,Does not work,"I installed them as recommended and they did not chase the vermin out of my yard. I liked the solar option, but found that the ultrasonic method is not efficient in the least. Various studies that I have come across confirm my findings. Like the other evaluator stated, ""a complete waste of money""."
3,"Formula, but a Good Formula","Bill Knox's series of novels featuring Webb Carrick, First Officer and scuba diver on the Fisheries Protection Services vessel Marlin, all follow a similar formula: Marlin comes into port; Carrick manages to find a girlfriend; there is a murder; Carrick uncovers plot (smuggling, Soviets planting spy beacons; insurance swindle, etc) and tracks down the murderer, always doing some scuba diving to find vital clues. The formula works well, and I've enjoyed all the ones I've read. However, none of them are especially memorable.""Whitewater"" is typical. It is a nice adventure/detection story. Not a great book but pleasurable reading."
4,My wife loves them,"I bought these as a Christmas gift for my wife, because her old slippers were worn out. These look great, they feel great and they keep her feet nice and warm. Plus, with the rubber soles she can wear them out to the mail box or to take the dog outside."
3,Briquettes for Lynx Grill,"The ceramic briquettes I purchased were not as good a quality as I expected. Even though the iten seemed to have been fairly well packed, there was much more flaking and some broken pieces than I expected. I also thought the shipping charges was a little exhorbitant.Char-Broil 2184773 6lb Hickory Ceramic Briquettes"
5,Amazing quality for the price,"Light and almost impossible to over steep, Clipper tea is balanced and tasty.Much higher quality than you would find a the average grocery."
4,Reading the past will help make the future specially in Tech,"One can look at A. Lincoln's address at Gettysberg makes one think that he had devine assistance unless you read where Lincoln was coming from and see how studied he was thereby allowing him to draw from history. Much of the technology we see now e.g. the hypertext language and other internet interworkings, satellite and missile activity came from ""Techies"" that studied techniques that came before allowing them to became fast studies. Most of our amazing break throughs came about by building on giants of the past going back to Leonardo, and many many more. Book was a good reminder of the progress of order and a lot of damn hard work."
5,"Brilliant, Vital, and On Target Evaluation of InfoSpace","Together with Edward Wilson's Consilience this is the most structured and focused book in this section, and has real applicability as to how one might organize a truly national (that is to say, not just spy) intelligence community. Written from a transatlantic perspective, integrating the best of American and European thinking in his references, the author addresses the nature of information, its structuring, the dynamics of sharing information, learning cycles, institutional and cultural contexts, and ends with this thought: that we have spent close to a century ""de-skilling"" the population to suit assembly line needs and now must spend close to a century ""re-skilling"" the population to deal with complex information tasks where every action and reaction will be unique."
2,Backs slip off way to easily,"I purchased these earrings for my daughter, due to her allergies to metals. They are very pretty, but the very first day she wore them, she lost one of the earrings. Wasted $25! I found a site with cheapo plastic earrings for $1.99 a pair. They aren't medical grade and are very flimsy, but will work until I can get her ears healed up a bit."
4,Pocket Guide to Narnia,"I have to say that sometimes I wonder about the authors who devote their lives to writing books about other people's fantasy novels-why not write your own epic? That aside, if you want to read a short biography of any of C S Lewis' diverse Narnian characters or creatures, or read up on Lewis' view of a certain spiritual, ethical, or literary ideal, this little book is the one to turn to.Every facet of Lewis' fantasy world, from Aslan and the Pevensies themselves all the way down to mundanely obscure characters mentioned only once are described in concise yet almost scholarly detail in this title. Also profiled are the history and culture of Narnia and the surrounding kingdoms, the symbolisms used by Lewis, and maps, chronology, and black-and-white drawings of important charcters and events.In short, this is an excellent pocket-sized guide to the products of the great imagination of C S Lewis."
4,An underrated collection,"In my humble opinion, Publisher's Weekly underrates this collection of Christian stories. They completely ignore the fact that the compiler includes stories by such luminaries as Hugo, Dostoevsky, O. Henry, and France. The Weekly also seems oblivious to the fact that Christian writers such as Walter Wangerin, Mark Littleton, Ruth Graham, and Joseph Bayly are either award-winning writers or are highly respected storytellers in the Christian world.Features such as the author's interesting introductions to each story were also well conceived. While it's true that more than one story from a particular author weakened the anthology a bit, the book is still a fine collection that will gain in recognition with time."
5,awesome,Great Book! I could not agree with this more. I recieved this book from a friends mom who loved it and passed it on to me! I highly reccomend that people read this book!
2,Disappointed,"Even though an attempt to bring an awareness of dogfighting was made, the video is overall unimpressive at best - boring, repetitive, hypocritical, unorganized, uninformative, lacking in style/interest/engagement...you get the point, i hope."
1,bloodline,"Mr. Besos,As long time customers we are going to have to boycott Amazon if you do not address the issues of what you sell encouring animal fighting, ie dogs and cocks. You do know these activities are FELONIES, don't you! You do know it represents servious breaking down of respect to living creatures. We need to DO ALL WE CAN AS A SOCIETY TO STOP ANIMAL FIGHTING. Would you take your child to a dog fight and place a bet? Would you stick around to see how the ""loser"" is dealt with....KILLED. Get them out of your inventory.....it is disgusting.Marcia Maxwell, Gerald Pool, Megan and Marilyn Maxwell, Thea Martin, Charlotte Bass-Lilly and many others!!"
1,AN ABSOLUTELY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY!!!!,For those of you INhuman humans who are attracted to dogfighting you should realize this viciously cruel pursuit of yours is ILLEGAL in ALL 50 states! And Amazon is NO better for selling dogfighting propaganda! I'm just glad the feds are keeping records as to who is buying and distributing this dvd for prosecutorial purposes!
2,disappointed,A very over hyped and over rated CD. Really quite boring and not anything ground breaking! Keep your money and buys something else.
3,Not a good value,"This product is an effective expectorant, but I wondered why it did not seem to have the effect I expected. I eventually compared to similar products, and found that it was about one third the strength of the other products. Therefore, the product is not nearly as good a value as others that I can buy, including some products from Amazon."
5,THE BEST RPG FOR THE SEGA SATURN,"two words BADD ARSE. this game is FANTASTIC and fun for all ages. if you have the sega saturn console, this game is a MUST, espessially for all those RPG fanatics. its just so sad that SEGA didn't release part 2 and 3 of the series. so dust off your sega saturn and GET THIS GAME!!!!!!! .............. NOW!!!!!!"
5,Great Stand-Alone Example / Exercise Book,"One of the weaknesses (IMHO) of computer books is that they usually include lots of code snippets, but rarely challenge you to write your own stuff. This book is the best of both worlds, if you have at least been briefly exposed to Java: it gives you well-commented code examples to illustrate points, then ends each chapter with a set of programming exercises for you to code yourself. This is the perfect combo, as far as I'm concerned. It stands on its own; in fact, I haven't even read the book it is a companion for! Great book, great concept, great execution."
5,Great companion to any JAVA curriculum,"I learned JAVA using the Core Java books and found that I wasnt learning anything from just typing in the examples in the book. I wasnt ""thinking"" JAVA. I saw a friend of mine at work with this book and picked up a copy for myself. First of all it contains source for several concepts for each of the various language topics. Then it gives exercises to complete. They were challenging, but not overly challenging that I needed to spend an entire day writing UML diagrams to do it. Good companion to any learning method you are using."
4,Good but better with the other books...,"This book, combined with Java in a Nutshell and Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell make for one great reference on Java. The examples are easy to follow and are well commented. Flanagan includes examples covering Java basics, objects, classes, input and output, threads, networking, security and crypto, internationalization, reflection, object serialization, GUI's, graphics, printing, data transfer, java beans, applets, RMI, DB access, servlets and JSP and some XML. Alone this is a nice book but like I said to get the most out of it, buy the other two books as well. It's well worth it to anyone wanting to further their understanding and knowledge of Java."
2,Little depth for any serious Java programmers,"This book did not impress me in the least bit. The examples were very immature, although correct, and you won't gain much insight in writing hardcore Java apps. You can find stronger coding examples in any popular Java magazine (JDJ, Java Pro, etc)"
4,Good Practical book,"This is a good book for 'programmers' who do not need a course on programming and want to jump straight into writing java code. It assumes the reader is familiar with the core language. Contains a lot of examples that can be used in day to day project, either as is, or to be used as a building block. The author should come out with another version which deals with more complex issues geared towards the serious programmer."
4,Great examples but need an extra class reference with it.,This book (as the table implies) has some awesome examples that inspire your own ideas to try plus I have been able to use some of them as whole. But you need a quick method/class reference to go with it because it will extensive use something it might have only named as say part of java.awt.. or it might suggest to further look up methods as it uses them.I bought it with Java in a Nutshell which has a reference in the back.
4,Very useful guide,"A useful primer for those considering climbing Aconcagua. Describes routes of many different difficulty levels. If you are planning on doing the normal route, most of the book will be irrelevant since it describes more difficult and technical approaches. However, even the introduction and normal route description are valuable references. Especially the sections on health and safety concerns. Hopefully there will be a new edition for 1999 since I understand that in 1999-2000, Argentine regulations will require permits to purchased in Mendoza IN PERSON by those climbing -- a change from the current practice."
4,"Very helpful book, but get the video too","Anyone thinking about this climb should get this book. It, along with the video that's also available from amazon.com, make a good combination to get you mentally prepared for Aconcagua."
1,Waste of money and time: Incredibly out of date,"I found this book a total waste of money, starting from totally useless route descriptions with incorrect altitudes of the camps and non-existing penitentes fields featured in them and finishing with an awfully bad and old photos. Basically, one will gain more by doing search for your planned route on Google."
4,FUN AND UPBEAT,"The music is from the actual TV shows and films, however some of the tracks (KNIGHT RIDER, SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN) do not contain the dialog that is heard on those shows (""Knight Rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist""; the communication between Steve Austin and Houston--the track starts at the crash and has Oscar Goldman's dialog, which isn't bad). The music is uplifting and inspiring for writing sci-fi, if you're into doing that sort of thing."
3,Cute Little Teapot,"I use this teapot several times a week. It's easy to clean, doesn't stain and I just throw it in the dishwasher. Only thing is.... it drips at the spout. If I pour a cup of tea and set the pot back down, then the pot drips and creates a ring that stains my counter or tray. That's the only problem. I also have the matching creamer and sugar bowl... I love my cute little set... except for the dripping..."
1,Chantal Ceramic 1-Quart Teapot,"poor quality. returned product shortly after it arrived. it drips all over the place. recommend against purchasing this product, as you will probably be disappointed."
1,Poor Quality,"I ordered this teapot because at the time it came with a free tea infuser. When it arrived, the teapot was broken, with a large section missing from the side. I returned it and had to pay the shipping to the company to reorder the same item after I received a refund only for the items price. After receiving my second teapot, it was cracked in the exact same spot. I returned the product and complained with no response. I was refunded the price for the teapot, but I am out $10 in the cost of shipping. It seems highly unlikely that two teapots would break in the exact same spot, so I would try a different product."
4,First new material in ages,"This is a quality EP showing a slight change in direction for Front 242. It's almost melodic at times with piano and keyboard motifs, but don't let that make you think that Front 242 have become passified by time, their music may have lost it's noise, but it's still edgy and scary.Jean-Luc DeMeyer's vocals are more expressed and melodic than ever before, it's like he is actually singing now, much more than before where he sung with venom and anger to express the bands points of view.'7Rain' is an excellent song with a low, rolling bassline allied to a tight electro beat. DeMeyer sings smoothly throughout it and the piano keys that wash over it are some of the most beautiful effects that 242 have ever done before.'Still and Raw' is a top-notch return."
3,"When electronic guru's get old, do their listeners?","...That's what these guys are banking on. I was somewhat disappointed with this release and very dissappointed with Pulse. What happened? I can understand that musicians need to grow and their music should reflect that, but on first listen to this release I am left wondering what songs didn't make the cut.This isn't bad, but it isn't really the band that I grew up with. A line from the song Rain : ""Am I getting grey?"" Yes, you must be, and a bit tired, chap. Take a virility pill for pete's sake. I can barely lift a glass of water to this music: it motivates me little.Thank golly I bought these for a fraction of the price on eBay.This is far better than Pulse.Songs worth mention: Strobe and CollisionI love these guys, but to be honest, it falls short of their prime brilliance. Here's a ""Damn"" for the record."
1,Did not receive item ordered,This vendor did not provide the item I ordered and did not respond to my attempts at contacting him.I am still waiting for Amazon.com to refund my money.I am very dissatisfied.Lorna
4,For Twice the Price Go Buy The CD With All 6 Books,"If you want a quick reference, try the CD on for size, speed, and thoroughness."
2,INDEX PLEASE!,Hmmm....A reference without a useable index. Information is there but impossible to access quickly and easily which somewhat defeats the purpose of the book. ORA does this all the time. I wish they would pay for an indexer and make their publications more useable.
3,Not a Stand alone Perl Reference,"This book falls short as a one-stop reference. Other ""In a Nutshell"" handbooks (VB & VBA in a Nutshell) go to the length of including not only syntax, but many useful examples. This book does little of that. It is a good reference as far as syntax goes and does dabble in the more advanced topics. However, it is best used with one of the other Perl reference books, like 'Perl Cookbook' or 'Learning Perl', very nearby."
4,Good reference book,"This is a good reference book, but very dry. It is hard to learn programming languages in a nutshell. One needs to understand how to solve problems using what the language offers. This part cannot be conveyed easily in a tight manner. Nevertheless, it is a good reference book as title suggests and worth for it."
1,High Level Descriptions with Few Samples,This book is full of alphabetical high level descriptions (which are always ambiguous) of Perl language statements with few or no illustrative examples (which always help clear up ambiguity).It is a waste of money.
3,"Good book if you use modules, so-so otherwise","Over 2/3 of this book is devoted to discussion of various Perl packages, modules, and other addons. If you need a one-book solution for hints on all of this, then you may benefit from this book. I don't use any of that stuff so I'm no better off with this than I was with the camel book. If you are looking for a general Perl reference I would not purchase this book."
3,"A handy reference, but...","This is a handy reference, but if you have a limited budget you should probably go with Programming Perl and the Perl Cookbook before this one. This is a fine reference but it doesn't have the depth that the other books have and the information on the modules is available online through CPAN. I have the entire Perl library on my bookshelf and I hardly ever pick this one up."
5,Learn more about yourself and tarot,"This book is great for the tarot reader who is ready to get a bit more out of tarot. The exercises are explained with detail and many examples are in the book. I appreciate the explanations that Nina Lee gives with each of the exercises. The best part is that there are no ""right"" or ""wrong"" answers. Nina Lee uses many different methods with these exercises, including art therapy and story writing. This book is currently ""front and center"" on my bookshelf!"
1,Save your money,This autobiography is written very poorly. The language is intented for children but it insults them with simplistic words. I had to laugh a few times because Ms. Kwan thinks she is brilliant when she really comes across as trying too hard to be a genius. It's not a bad thing. She's a young kid posing as a brilliant philosopher but it doesn't work. Her writing is as unnatural as her artistic qualities in her sport. Nice try!
2,Mediocre,"Like Michelle, this book is somewhat pretentious but it's still a decent read. Really young kids will like it. She did not write it but told her story to the author. Nice pictures"
1,Flimsy,This book is flimsy and not worth the money. The book is called an autobiography but its not. It was written by someone else. You don't learn anything new from this book.
1,Acceptable book,It was OK. I've read much better books about skating. Michelle is an OK writer. She should stick to skating and lay off the psychology.
1,Not one of the better skating books,It's not a very good book. It's hard to take her problems seriously when they involve being second in the world and the United States. Excuse me while I get the violin ready. This book is not a tearjerker and it isn't inspirational. Jackie Collins has a book deal too but that doesn't mean her writing is good. I think big skating fans will enjoy it but more intellectual readers will be left wanting more. I would recommend the buyer shop more before buying this book.
5,She is the best!,If you're a fan of michelle then you will realize why after reading this book. The book is geared towards a younger audience but you can read between the lines and see that michelle is a sweet person who is only human. She is the most popular figure skater out there and yet she just wants to be a regular person.
3,An interesting and up to date history but doesn't live up to its premise,"If you're trying to take away valuable management lessons, this book isn't for you.If, however, you want a quick and up to date history of Apple, this book is worth considering.Definitely repetitious and the management take aways are in most cases a stretch."
2,Pictures are frightening for a small child,"My granddaughter has enjoyed watching Martha on the Internet, so when I saw that the Martha Walks the Dog available through Amazon, I decided to buy it for her. Upon arrival, I was alarmed to see the drawings in the book. One of the dogs looks mighty ferocious!! My granddaughter didn't need to see that. Not a book to cuddle up with."
1,Very unhappy!,"I bought this product because most reviews were so good. After I received them I understood why. They arrive with a letter begging for a good review in return for a chance to win a DVD LCD player.This upset me. I buy many items based on the review. If the review is being minipulated then it's useless. These towels are thin,too small to get all my hair like my old set and absorb nothing. waste of money."
2,Ok...for the price.,"I bought this at a local dollar store because I heard microfiber towels were the best for drying highly textured tresses with the least damage. With that said, I would not repurchase. The towel snagged my coils and left white lint in my jet black hair. I now use a black cotton t-shirt to dry my hair--no snags or lint."
1,WAY too small,"This product arrived quickly and in good packaging. However, the hair wrap is designed for small heads, such a child's head. Don't buy this for an average-sized adult. I'm not able to to use it."
1,"small, not very absorbent buy The Original Turbie Twist","I have thin shoulder length hair and a rather small head for an adult. This barely covered my head and hair. It was absorbent, soggy absorbent....not enough material to be efficient ! I went to Bed Bath & beyond and picked up The Original Turbie Twist, which is highly superior...they just get pilly after a years worth of washing, but they work great, much better than this brand"
1,Not worth the money,"I'd had a Turbie Twist for many years, and figured it was time to replace it, so I purchased several of these (the April Brand) from the Dollar Tree, thinking they were the same thing. Boy was I mistaken.This item is NOT a Turbie Twist. The April Brand is very thin & cheaply made. It has a harsh feel compared to the real Turbie Twist. It isn't soft and comfortable at all. If you have alot of hair, forget trying to use this knock off brand as well, as it won't hold your hair at all! Plus, the connecting lope breaks within a few months of use. Every single one I got broke. It was a major disappointment.This item is not to be mistaken for the wonderful Turbie Twist! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139XON2/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i02They are well worth the extra price, as the quality is exceptional.The terry cloth is thick like a egyptian cotton bath towel, and the connection loop is solid."
3,Microfiber Turbie Twist,"It took alot longer to receive then I expected. I ordered two but only received one. It is much smaller the I expected for my hair, I think would be good for someone with short hair."
4,Really nice,I like using these much better than regular bath towels. My only complaint is that they could be a little thicker so they are more absorbant. Maybe that's just because of my long hair!
2,Too small,"This wrap is too small for adult head or long hair. I have an old wrap (different brand) that works wonderfully. I am very disappointed with this one. I have to pile hair on head to fit under wrap at all. Unable to flip hair and wrap as directed. Wrap narrows toward end too narrow to use as needed with long hair. I don't find it to be very absorbent. Maybe short hair would work just fine, but definitely not if you have long hair."
5,This hair wrap is perfect!!!!,"I love this hair wrap, I ordered 3 of them for me and my daughters. It works great, my daughters are able to wrap their hair up in the wrap, with no problem. It holds well, and soaks up the water great. I wanted something that would work better than having bath towels used just to wrap hair, and having bath towels hung all over the bathroom and doors. This is perfect we just wrap our hair up, get dressed and then hang our wrap up on a hook. Just love it!!!"
5,Happy,Product arrived quickly and was exactly as described. It works great and I am very happy with it. Great product overall.
4,Hair twist,Great product for the price. I use them while traveling. They aren't the same thickness as the leading brand but hold hair nicely. Better product more to put hair up and do make up or facial than dry hair.
1,Microfiber trubie twist,"Not worth it ,you'll find something better than this in Ross or any other store! it's not even drys the hair!"
1,You won't like it,"I have been thinking what to write for several months. I tried to give this towel a chance, but the truth is that they don't work. They don't remove excess of water from your hair. My hair drops even with the towel on. After I remove it, it will also wet my shirt.Doesn't matter how cheap they are... they can't have more than one star.I'm sorry family business, try to sell a different product."
1,Don't buy it,"This was not an adult size, not sure if it is even big enough for kids. I don't advise buying it."
1,Awful Product,"I picked up one a couple of years on a whim ago from Home Goods, and i absolutely love it. I wanted to get a couple for friends at Christmas Time and orders 3 of these. They were thin, and small and just seemed made of a very cheap material. I tried to send them back to the address on the invoice and they were returned to me undeliverable."
3,Not as easy as it looks,"I can put it on but, little side hairs hang out and before long half of my hair in back was out. However the hair still in it dryed quicker."
1,Very poor quality,"Bought this for my wife for a stocking stuff,It is very poor quality.What I would expect for a hand towel if I was staying at at very cheap hotel.She put her hair up in it and it was instantly soaked and did not even start to get her hair dry."
1,very poor quality,"If you want a towel for your hair that is good quality, don't buy this one. I have medium length hair, not too thick and when I take the towel off, my hair is still soaked. I have some that are better quality and I love them... I ws very disappointed in these. I had given some away as gifts and then used one that I ordered for myself. Because I love the product idea itself, I ordered NEW towels that cost a little bit more here on Amazon and I plan on giving the new ones to the people I gave these to as gifts with an apology because I feel bad giving people I love such cheap crap. Very thin... you can actually see through them between the fibers. :("
1,Absolutely terrible,"I bought this exact item at a Dollar Tree and was surprised to see it on Amazon (and that it received any favorable reviews whatsoever)! At the time of purchase my hair was very long, somewhere mid-back in length. I knew my hair would be too long, but I was curious. My hair was laughably too long for it. What hair I could wrap in it was dried no better than a regular towel.I donated 15 inches of my hair and tried it again with my new shoulder-length hair. Still no good. My hair is fine and there's lots of it. Hopefully it's not my hair type that made this item ineffective. I'm looking at other ones. I do not recommend this particular product, but I have hopes that there is a hair wrap that will work."
1,Poor product,"I have had the scunci brand of this product before (it was 15.00 about 6 years ago) and was looking for a second so i could wash the first more frequently. Yes, the other brand was so good i hated to wash it for fear of it not being there after my shower and in the dryer instead :-). So I bought this product at a local dollar store - and was absolutely dissapointed. I have medium to long length hair and it doesn't all fit into this Turban and my hair is still sopping wet after using this one - whether it was the part of my hair in the turban or not. This is certainly a case of ""you get what you pay for"". A big thumbs up for hair drying turbans 5 big thumbs down for this brand."
3,Not as good or as big as the original,"I have near waist length thick curly hair & use these turbie twists towels all the time. Of course nothing beats the original but for vacations/trips & the gym I buy the cheaper versions. Most are not bad, you get what you pay for & they definitely do not last as long, either the button on the back comes off or the elastic gets worn or they just stop absorbing, but this brand I just purchased is significantly smaller than any other versions I have ever bought.I know most people do not have waist length thick curly hair, but if you do I recommend you spend another $1-$3 & get a better quality towel. I cannot attest to the absorbability or durability at this time only used it twice @ the gym. But will update as need arises."
4,As advertised,Shipped promptly and was as it was advertised. Did come with the loop to attach the wrap broken but decided to keep the product anyway and just repair it at home.
2,never again,This product was very disappointing. It is 1/2 the size of the original Turbie Twist and no where near as absorbant. When I realized out was from China I understood the problem. I wouldn't buy this again.
1,too little!,This towel was too little! it wouldn't hold all of my hair and it was more work than it was worth!!
5,An Indian nightingale,"I first heard Kiran on a compilation CD, which I've since long forgotten. I have almost worn holes in my Kiran CD's!Her music is accessible to anybody, and different people will appreciate different aspects of her music because her style is so diverse. Her voice is unbelievable and it carries you on a journey up and down scales only to be dreamed of by pop artists, with scary accuracy.My favourite track on the CD is Yakeenan, but I love all of them, there isn't a ""space filler"" anywhere to be seen.You don't even need to understand the many languages spoken in India to understand and appreciate Kiran's music, because the emotion evoked in the passion of her voice transcends any boundaries of language.This and another CD called by her name are my two favourite CD's. They can be difficult to get hold of, so buy asap! I promise you won't be disappointed."
4,Good Indian Music,"I bought this CD on recommendation and am glad I did. The music is classic Indian, but the vocalist is great. Kiran Ahluwalia is a great new talent on the world music scene."
2,Not Very Exciting,"This would have been a decent workout -- qualified instructors, fun if somewhat repetitive moves -- but the barely-there, uninspiring music made it an annoying bore. Who wants to work out (especially when it's supposed to be an upbeat, dancey workout) in silence? Bad production quality ruins what would otherwise have been a good video. The ""hi-lo"" video by the same group is much better."
5,I'm dancing..i'm sweating...i'm dancing....,"This is the first fitness video I ever bought and I'm so glad that I did. Not only does it give you an incredible workout, you learn cool dance moves. Pepper kinda gets on my nerves because it seems like he doesn't know what he's doing sometimes, but the rest of them are good. Donna's segment rocks, but I loved Joel's the best. Must be something about the Charleston--I love learning to dance. It is true that the quality isn't the best, but who cares!! Just go with it and have fun!"
2,VHS Tape was Cracked,The video was cracked when it arrived. Hard to say if it was cracked before or happened in transit. Luckily i was able to fix it.
5,simply chillin good!,"Let me start by saying the Afterlife Lounge releases are all great with each having a slightly different style than the others which at least keeps the series fresh. The great tunes on this one definitely far outweigh the few skippable tunes. Really there is only one song that should be scratched (How Does It Feel). Some depeche mode sounding guy sings on it which is like sandpaper rubbing against my eardrums, but other than that this rocks and I hope they keep making more. Glad I tracked this group down after discovering them on Ambient Lounge 3."
2,Ian Moore goes his own way with disaster,"After two albums and one EP of wonderful blues based music Ian has departed into an area few have ventured and survived. Ian's mastery of guitar is hidden behind an eclectic collection of misguided efforts. Ian would do well to grab the tele strat beast, crank the Fender twin and release his passion through his fingers instead of poetic ramblings. Listening to any track on his previos efforts (Ian Moore, Live From Austin, or Mondern Day Folklore) will get the point across why Ian Moore will on day be mentioned with Hendrix, Clapton, Guy, or Allman. This album is a must buy, because Ian is an incredible talent that needs to be heard, I just hope he plays the guitar and sings the way he sings best, with soul and passion, on his next album."
4,"Great stuff, but it's an artist's indulgence","This one has got Ian's best songs on it, along with some of his finest performances. It's rare that an artist can toned himself down and end up sounding more distinct for it, but that's what Ian does. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't cohere to me. The styles jump around a little too much, but with the skip button on the cd player, that's not much of a problem. Also, although I pretty much love everything that Ian does, the ragtime of ""Ain't feeling No Pain"" is just plain jive to me. Coulda been left off."
1,Actual Can Size,"The offer states 8 oz can, but in reality, it is a 6 oz can. Ona does not make a 8 oz can... Be careful...."
2,"Maybe a book for someone, but not someone like me.","Critical theory, in my view, often walks a line between providing real insight into art and society, and getting caught up in it's own self-referential obfuscation, substituting wordiness and word play for true insight. I think that's what has happened here. At least for me, I had to work too hard to find too little.I've read a lot of critical theory, and this type doesn't do it for me. But if you like theory to be art in itself, more about itself than the purported topic--in this case monsters and monstrosities--then you may, like the other reviewer, enjoy this work. But I prefer the work of Anijar, Barone, MacLaren, work that turns outward as well as inward.I suggest using the ""look inside"" feature to examine this book before buying. See if it's the flavor of critical theory that moves you."
4,Become a sushi chef overnight!,"This is an excellent beginner's book for sushi lovers. Includes beautiful color photos to show the art of presentation and the beauty of the cuisine. It could have included pronuciation tips for some of the words, and the technique described for making nori rolls was awkward (I place strips of filling on rice closer to the center), but otherwise I highly recommend this book."
4,Dated but workable,"The big problem with this book is that it was written in 1982, and American sushi culture has had its own evolutionary path since then. The profusion of maki that dominates American sushi isn't here, which is fine, but it also doesn't mention the omnipresent California roll.That said, it's an excellent book, and I have no doubt that with this book and a few months of intensive practice anyone can become a passable sushi chef. The ingredients are easier to find now than they were, and this book also provides a number of forms of sushi that simply don't get seen much in American sushi bars. You will need other references for some of the esoterica, but this book will have you up and running on the basics quickly, and even if you so choose making some very interesting items that you don't see every day."
1,A waste of time and money,"""SUSHI MADE EASY"" by Nobuko Tsuda is a complete was a complete waste of time and money for myself. I was going to the shops to buy a new book to help make sushi for my son's school when I came across this book. As it was highly recommended, I felt obliged to purchase it. I wish that I had not done so. It was not helpful and the ingredients were either hard to find or extremely expensive. To anyone that is thinking about buying this book, I say to you, ""DON'T!"" Buy another one. LOVE JOANNE BURKE (karen_mcvea@hotmail.com). Bye everybody! P.S. Don't you just love the new Daphne & Celeste song - ""U.G.L.Y.""???"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! This is free on disney website!!,"In a hurry to rent/buy something for my daughter and didn't read the description. Now I did a search on Google and found the same video for free at Disney!! I feel really stupid for buying this!!! Never thought Amazon would have such small videos as I'm used to rent full movies and they are about the same price. For my daughter I usually get the free ones available for Amazon Prime subscribers.UPDATE: 2/19/2013 - Based on comments, it may not be free on Disney's website anymore and NOW Amazon has the word ""SHORT"" in the title. It was not the case when I bought it by mistake... anyway... my review is still 1 star as I still believe this is not worth the price. Currently you can rent the full movie for 2.99, so why get this for 1.99??... You may say 1.99 is to buy this one, but I don't see this being replayed very often to justify the purchase. My daughter watched just once and didn't get her interested anymore."
3,Fleeced Ever After,"It was fun and my kids watched it at least three times in a row. However, I would have preferred to use the $2.99 for a rental rather than this purchase. I'm not crazy about Disney's over-protection of their movies. Let us buy your movies instead of rental-only. This could have been a bonus with the purchase and I would have gladly paid the extra 3 bucks if they'd let me buy the principal film.Oh well. It's done. But I'll be sure to pay closer attention to the length of purchases next time."
5,"Really cute, for fans of the movie Tangled","First, this is a SHORT. Like, the 5 minute SHORTS that appear before Disney films in the theaters. This is NOT a full length feature. It is not a commercial either.It's about the horse and the lizard trying to save Rapunzel and Flynn's wedding after losing their rings, and it's cute.I also payed for this with some free video credits, so I didn't have to buy Cinderella on Bluray to watch it. Better, cheaper alternative."
3,Should have on cost 99 cents or less,I thought I was getting the whole movie. I did not realize that it was only a cartoon. I would not have paid 1.99 for this if I'd have known what it was.
3,Too short,"This was a cute little ""clip"" and I should have looked a little closer as I can't believe I paid almost $3 for a 20 minute cartoon. We thougth this was a movie when we downloaded and bought it. HOWEVER, it was cute, vivid colors and great picture quality. But disappointed in the length."
3,"I was excited to see this movie offered, but","I didn't get to see this movie when it was out. My girls and I love tangled and I was excited to see this movie. It was very cute, and as always great animation. The girls and i laughed through a lot of it. however, it was not worth the two dollars i spent for it. I felt really dumb spending money for a five minute movie. this should have been offered for free, or attached to another movie. I really felt ripped off.At least with the instant play we had the movie for a few day and though i would watch it again, but honestly there wasn't anything to watch. once you see the movie it didn't seem to be something we wanted to see again.if you have two dollars to spend maybe it is worth it, but i would never do it again. even with a gift card balance."
1,Rip OFF!,I accidentally mistaken this for a movie for the kids. I want my money back! This should be free! Yet they charge 2.99 for a preview
1,"Don't buy, seven minutes long","I always read reviews but my daughter ""tricked me"". Since the movies on Amazon are usually rented for $2.99 stupid me went for it. I can't believe it - it ended before it started. If I blinked I would have missed all of it. Sucks! Want my money back out of principle, not because I can't afford 3 dollars. I feel tricked and cheated out of my money!"
4,Cute Short,Tangled Ever After was a really cute short movie that made me laugh. Definitely worth seeing if you liked the Tangled movie!
3,Tangled Ever After,"I love the video itself, but the quality of the video was not the greatest. Images are blurry and not clear in the video."
2,Confusing,My daughter thought she was buying the movie and was very disappointed when she realized it was a short. Why charge so much for a short?
2,Tangled Ever After (Short) was not what I expected.,This video was extremely short and not at all what I had expected to show my granddaughter. Description should be clearer to the customer.
4,Good add-on to movie,The kids loved it as we watched it right after they watched Tangled for the first time. It doesn't really add to the story and instead it's just supposed to be a funny story about the wedding. Kids enjoyed it however they play it on Disney channel a lot we found out afterwards so you may just want to set your DVR instead of buying/renting.
5,My kids love this short...,'Reasonably priced & available in HD...Thank you Amazon! My kids never tire of watching this on their respective Kindle Fire HD devices. I am forever a fan of 'amazon.com'
5,Wonderful film,This is one of my favorite Disney films. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi have great sonic chemistry. It's a nice adaptation of The Rapunzel story.
3,made sense after seeing tangled,first time I saw it was before the regular movie and did care much for it but watched it again after the reg. movie and it was good
5,Cute short film,"This is such a cute short film that is about Rapunzel's wedding. Can't say too much without giving any spoilers. Also, you can never go wrong with Disney (:"
1,Short!!!,I didn't realize I was paying for a 7minute movie. I thought maybe it didn't download all the way... It did:/
2,Disappointed,"I bought this Short for my three+ year old daughter. The movie itself is cute and she loved it, however, you cant download it, unless you have a Kindle. I do not. I have an iPad and an iPhone. My daughter uses an older 2nd gen iPod touch to watch some of her shows/ movies and play some games. She's not really able to log in to my account, with the purpose of watching videos... It would have been better if we were able to download it and put the movie onto her ""Pod"". Instead, it never gets watched at all. :("
1,not a movie most like a preview,not worth the money for a couple of minutes of a preview. always check how many minutes the so call movies are.
5,A nice soft goodbye to beloved caracters.,"This is a quick, cute, silly adventure that lets you see these wonderful characters one more time. I liked seeing that the Stabbington brothers had not been executed, the King and Queen were happy with Rapunzel marrying Eugene, and the Snuggly Duck thugs are still happily following their dreams. We get to see Rapunzel's wedding gown, and have a fun little adventure with Maximus and Pascal over the wedding rings. It shows the animator's impressive skill when the two main characters say so much, yet never utter a single word. If you loved Tangled, you will love this little add on short as well."
2,Too Short.,"It was kind of funny. It reminded me of the original movie ""Tangled"". It downloaded like it was supposed to."
3,Tangled Ever After,Very cute. Much shorter than I realized but worth the watch. It is great for parents that want something short to settle the kids down before bed.
2,tangled forever after,"The movie is very cute and funny. However the quality of the video is terrible. It is slow, it cuts all the time, it is hard to understand anything. I have great internet, which means it is the products fault."
3,Tangled Ever After short and sweet...,"For $2.99 you think you are renting a movie but, you are buying a 7 minute clip.Very short but, fun to watch and own!"
1,DO NOT BUY!! SHORT & FREE ON DISNEY,"We normally stick to Prime. I was in a hurry to get my son something new and exciting and he loves Tangled. Very disappointed 7 minutes later and once I read the reviews, which I usually always do first. AND it is free on Disney site!"
1,Read the title!!!,"Just read the title which I did not. Short means about 7 minutes short and I paid 1.99. Total ripoff, why would they have this on there as something that is paid for! Well, the kids were very disappointed to say the least."
1,What a ripoff!!,"I ordered this through my smart tv and I thought this show would be longer than under 7 minutes. Nope was I wrong. The info did not have how long it was supposed to be until you rent it first. It was funny, but I want my 2 dollars back. I'm so disappointed."
1,Paying 1.99 for 7 minutes of movie? Ridiculous!,I'm very upset to pay 1.99 to watch a less than 10 minutes movie. That's a rip off. I'm not happy at all.
1,Not worth paying for.,It was cute but I didn't realize it wasn't an actual movie-more like a trailer to the movie coming out.
3,I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS,I have yet to use it regularly so I don't really have much to say about it. It tastes not so good and I wonder if it's supposed to take appetite away by making you feel nautious ..? I got nautious a couple of times.
5,Fantastic,"No Saturn owner should be without this controller, the best peripheral released for the console. I've had a Saturn for 12 years and only got this recently, and it has given a whole new life to my old favorites like NiGHTS and Panzer Dragoon Saga."
3,Doenst work with usb adapter,Didnt work with 3 in 1 magic-box saturn to pc adapter. I havnt tried it on saturn yet but seems like solid controller. Manufactured in Japan.
2,"if you are just starting to read Carr, don't start here....","I love John Dickson Carr's wild plots and atmoshperic settings, but I simply cannot recommend this particular novel. It was written at a time when the author was suffering increasing health problems, and this is simply not up to the caliber of his ""golden age"" detective novels. This book almost struck me like an attempt by someone other than Carr, someone without his considerable talents, to immitate the type of books Carr was writing at the height of his career.If you have not read a John Dickson Carr book, start with something more substantial than this. I would recommend The Lost Gallows, or Hag's Nook, as a good starting place to become acquainted with this giant from the golden age of the puzzle story."
2,Environmental Black Faeries,"Buffy novels are usually enjoyable, heart-warming and thrilling. I'm sorry to write, ""Unnatural Selection"" doesn't offer that. The premise was promising; Willow's environmental activism, a possessed baby and Xander's comic book pal. Hutch, who's chock full of intrigue, could have been developed a bit more. The characterization of the Scoobies wasn't bad, but the plot was so divergent and non-linear. This reader never became fully invested in the novel. The big unanswered question involves the connection between the faeries and the vampires and did Odom completely forget that Buffy had a mother? Odom has written better Buffy novels. Skip this one."
5,A fascinating story that will keep you hooked,"This has to be one of the best Buffy original novels yet! I loved everything about it - the plot was interesting and unpredictable, moved at the perfect pace, and, best of all, focused on my favorite character, Willow. I liked the author's style, how he planted little seeds, then harvested them all in a satisfying way. Unlike the last book, Visitors, I didn't get the sense of unfinished business - he did a good job of tying up all the loose ends. So if you want a great read that'll suck you in and leave you wanting more, pick up Unnatural Selection. You won't regret it!"
4,"READ IT, IT'S GREAT!!","The little baby Willow is supposed to babysit starts making threats, the woods and the park is flooding with vamps and Cordy is planning Spring Blow in the park, get ready for an adventures trip to Sunnydale(has it ever been boring?NOPE!!)Willow is organizing demonstrations against a company that wants to build an amusment park in the park she grew up in. Cordy is furious with Will because this will ruin her plans for a big Spring party in the park. Then evil,mad faries(changelings) kidnap little babies to get their way with the forest(they are protecting it,kind of).They kidnap the baby Wills watching. Mean while more and more vamp are found in the forest near an archeaological dig.The Scooby gang has a lot to do and as the plot thickens it seems like it's to much for them to handle.What happens? Read it, you won't be abel to put it away.It is a really good book, not up to Golden and Holder standards but all in all good."
2,Somethings Missing,"As a fan who reads every Buffy book published as soon as I can get my hands on it, I was a little dissapointed. The plot was ok I guess but the authors style of writing was nothing special. Throughtout the whole book I felt that something was missing, something that draws you into the book & makes you read it dozens of times. Idea: take it out of the library, don't waste money on a book thats not really worth it."
1,Huh?,I don't understand the high ratings on this book. It sucked. It was so boring. I like most of the Buffy books but this one was just a snoozer.
2,A little lacking,"I am interested in the nuts and bolts, brick and mortar part of the railroad industry. This book dealt too much with financial institutions and political connections for me. I could care less about the problems management had with workers, or if a union wanted to organize, or if they were having money problems. I wanted more photos, with views of the erecting floors and machine shops, things of that nature. Not enough topics concerning the actual construction process."
2,Rough sledding,"So far I find it to be a summary, of just what I am still not sure, as I set out to read the Intro., Conclusion, and select parts. Where Jews are presented as ""people of the book,"" I feel I am reading a scholar not well versed in Hebrew or Judaism, but instead somebody reaching after a tertium comparationis. While I can see there are medieval foundations of ""The Western Intellectual Tradition,"" I fail to grasp why Greece and Rome fail to measure up--an negative claim the author is really in no position to argue. I will keep hoping."
3,Gorgious bosooms,"Tammy Parks or whoever she may be at this time and place, has a great set of knockers.are you sure"
1,Read the fine print on this one,"This recording was taken from a live 1981 performance in Canada. In my opinion, this album sounds like it was recorded by someone hiding under a blanket in the lobby. If you are expecting the sound quality that you usually get from a studio recording, you will probably be in for a major disappointment."
3,It was ok,There was nothing terribly new or ground-breaking in this DVD. It was very similar to most other methods and advice that I have seen previously.
2,Not what I expected,"If you are into old movies, then I guess this is the book for you. I was looking more into what type of routine or routines Joe used to stay fit. There was a pictorial workout using bodyweight only,at almost the back pages and the problem was that the print that explained the photos was so small that was hard to read."
5,Beautiful Ring,This is a truly beautiful ring at a amazingly affordable price. I bought one for myself and one for a friend whose birthday is also in July. I would recommend this to anyone.
1,"Long-winded, Academic and No New Research","The authors of this academic (boring) book complied a variety of research, but it would have been more helpful if they had conducted some experiments instead of just compiling the research of others. It really seems to be useless."
2,Not terribly useful.,"The coverage of Java syntax is adequate, and the writing is good. But the class documentation is virtually copied from the Sun SDK documentation. Class methods are listed but not described. In all honesty I find this book useful in only one situation: when I already know exactly what class I'm looking for. Outside of those rare instances, this book, like the Sun SDK documentation, is difficult to use as a Java reference."
3,Java in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference,"The first part, a short introduction to Java, is reasonable, but the second part is a hopeless muddle, ordered by package and then class, with little information about what methods actually do and usually just the bare calling sequence. The class, method and field index is a good idea and a useful feature of the book. The serious Java programmer would do better to buy the Addison-Wesley two volume set, the Java Class Libraries, which are at least in Class order, although even these are becoming unwieldy with addition of supplements for Java 2. Not really recommended."
2,George Ho,"I have experience in several languages including Pascal, Fortran and COBOL. But I have no OOP knowledge. I can fellow the first two chapters about OOP, Classes and Methods comfortably and learnt a lot from them. But after that, it jumps discontinuously to the level out of my reach. Also it does not teach the function of the language's built-in methods at all."
5,The best Java 1.1 value on the market.,"This deluxe addition includes the text of five O'Reilly Java 1.1 titles on the CD-ROM. The text is fully indexed and searchable, the hypertext presentation immensely browseable. As a mobile consultant, this unique reference resource has become indispensible to me. My highest recommendation."
4,Good for OOP programmers otherwise beware,"This book, like the other Nutshell books is consise and to the point. However I would very strongly suggest that if you are a non Object Orientated Programmer that you bring yourself up to speed on those concepts first. If you do already know OO then this is a good book for you as it takes you into the basics of Java and how use it in a clear and helpfull way. You will need to buy another book to bring you up to speed on Java 1.2, which is what I have done."
3,Not all that impressed,"If you are looking to learn Java (code), this book will provide a reference but won't teach you much. If you are looking for Java (OO) concepts, this book will leave you looking for more as well. Everything in this book can be found by browsing the Sun website, primarily in the JavaDoc or in the Developer's Connection. If you want to be a Java guru, this book could compliment others, but won't stand on its own by any means."
2,Outdated and offers only tacit coverage of depth or breadth,Being somewhat new to the Java language I purchased Java in a Nutshell by David Flanagan as a resource for understanding of the Java language as well as a reference source. I have found this book to be extremely outdated and covers just the minimum of syntax as well as classes. The java class descriptions and coverage is a barely more than a summary of the variables and methods extracted from the java source. There has been a significant number of java classes since Java 1.1 which the reader would do better by getting the descriptions and sources from the javasoft website.
3,The reference section needs more information,The class methods are simply listed. A short description of various arguments and return values could have been an excellent thing. Without these details the book has only a very limited use.
4,must have reference text,"ISBN 156592262X or 1565923049 for the deluxe CD version. This is David Flanagan's classic text on Java published by O'Reilly. It is for experienced programmers new to Java, not new to programming. It covers the Java language and lists all the methods of the standard classes, indexed in a variety of convenient ways. Unfortunately there is no room to provide anything you could not find out by looking at the JavaDOC. It would be nice, if at least on the CD, there were additional notes about the various gotchas, how the various methods are used together etc. It is a reference, not a tutorial. It comes in two versions, plain and deluxe with CD that includes four other books: Exploring Java, the Java Language Reference, Java Fundamental Classes Reference, and the Java AWT Reference. The author answers his email and uses the feedback to improve the book."
3,"Not very useful, look elsewhere","Java in a Nutshell doesn't do much for anyone. If you're learning to program, look at Core Java. If you need a reference book, The Java Class Libraries, Second Edition Volumes 1 and 2 are an absolute must. If you need a cheaper, smaller reference, McGraw Hill puts out a book whose title escapes me. Java in a Nutshell is an adequate introduction to some new issues in Java 1.1, but it isn't a good reference (too skimpy), it isn't a good tutorial, and the introduction stuff is better covered in numerous Web sites."
4,This is on my desk and it should be on yours !,"Hello, My name is Johnathan Mark Smith from the Staten Island Java Group (http://www.statenislandonline.com/java) and I would just like to every one one the internet that I think this book is one that has to be on your desk or you are not a relly java programmer ! ! it comes with a many other books on a cd-rom"
4,"Great style of reference, but you better learn C++ first","Firstly, this book is a great reference to the Java 1.1 API. Also, it's at a great price and very well written.The problem is, I didn't have a C++ background when I picked it up, so there were sections of the book that meant little to me. Such as ""The Switch statement is the same in Java as in C++"". Huh?"
4,The first book you should buy,"Nice book. It is precise but probably too brief. If you have solid skills in C/C++ and some JAVA 1.0 background, this is an excellent book for you. Two thumbs up for first several chapters about core language, but probably need more for the rest. Anyway, this is supposed to be a quick reference, so I should not complain."
3,Not that impressed,"I had read the raving reviews from people and I bought this book on that basis. I have used the book half a dozen times in the last two months to look up specific aspects of the language. It has yet to provide me useful input to solve a problem.For example: today I look up how null is used/handled. The book has 4 dry lines (with no code sample) -- no help to understand how or when it can be used. Another example: a couple of days ago, I want to look up how rounding function works -- sorry, not in the index.I have found Ivor Horton's ""Beginning Java 2"" a superior book in all respects: to introduce the language and as an ongoing reference. Horton's index isn't perfect either but his book is a much better resource.I still give the book 3 stars because I haven't found any factual errors and the English is fine. I just don't find this book useful."
