1,stolen,This item was stolen by security personnel at Miami airport before I had adequate timt to become familar with all the features and to review the video I had taken.
5,Love this camcorder,"This camcorder is small lightweight and very easy to use. I only have one complaint and that is that the disc only records for a half hour, and sometimes I push the off button whan I want to zoom! These are both things I can live with. The price is steep but worth it because it has the latest tecnology. When you watch the dvd it is like you were there!! Great camcorder!!"
4,Great product,"Easy to use, pretty much just point and shoot. Glad I had read reviews from other consumers regarding the lack of a complimentary disk. That's the least Sony could have done, considering the cost of the camera!"
3,"Good camera, but room for improvement","I have had this camcorder for a few weeks now. I am a professional photographer (still pictures), but I am new to video. While the video is reasonably good, I wish the camera would focus faster. My biggest complaint is the software, or lack thereof. It is limited, hard to use, and looks like it was written as a college project. I expect more from Sony, and for $800."
5,No Complaints,"At first I was a little skeptical ordering this product off-line being it was so much money. But compared to Circuit city, Best buy and other stores around here I was saving over $150 so I decided to order it. I received the product on time and it was brand new and everything seems to be working fine. It is a easy camcorder to use."
1,"received a used camcorder, not a NEW one as advertised","But the customer support was very good. My money was returned as promised, but it did cost me a week of my time."
1,Don't buy it if you use a Mac,"It does not support FireWire connection and you can't edit images captured with the 405 directly in your Mac, using iMovie or FinalCut. This information was not clear in the pre-sales available materials from Sony by the time this review was written.You can't use the USB connection to import your raw images to iMovie. You will need a lot of effort to do so: 1) finalize the disc; 2) copy the .VOB files to your Mac desktop; 3) search geek's web forum until you find tips on how to convert .VOB files to iMovie-editable formats like .MOV and .MPG. And of course you will lose movie quality doing so.Terrible user experience.I've e-mailed Sony Customer Service and the first reply I got was from an automated machine completely ignoring the fact that I use a Mac (I had indeed selected 'Mac OS' in the web site e-mail form, and also made it very explicit while writing).I seriously do not recommend this camera if you plan to edit your movies using a Mac."
5,Outstanding Camcorder,"This is simply an outstanding camcorder. After spending much time researching different camcorder formats and products I decided to purchase the Sony (mini-DVD) DCR-DVD405. I have no regrets whatsoever. The camcorder is impressively designed, easy to use, and produces top-quality video. The accompanying software makes burning full-sized DVD's quite easy. I'm also happy I purchased the camcorder through AMAZON. Their price and service were terrific. You will not be disappointed with this camcorder!"
5,Very nice cam,I bought this for myself. But my son has four kids and I ended up giving the camera to him. I have no little kids no more but when I did I was always taking video. I used this cam a bit and it was great.
3,mystery enthusiast,"These are okay. The acting in Psych is so meldaramic. The Monk isn't as good as the earlier ones. It wasn't offensive or anything, just not real good stories or acting."
4,Why not save money?!?,"If you like Monk and are a fan of Psych, why not buy these bundled and save around $20. There is nothing new or special in this set. It is not some special edition, just a great way to get two season of entertainment for the price of one."
5,Psych Psycho,"We own all five seasons of Monk now. My entire family enjoys watching Monk. Psych was definitely a bonus because we had watched several of the episodes on USA and enjoyed it. It was a great deal to offer both of them together. There are so many shows on today that I won't allow my kids to watch and these two series have minimal language (of which I block with my dvd player) and is w/o all the sexual advances and inuendos. If you like detective shows, these are worth watching."
4,cheap but effective,"I looked at so many of these things, this product was the best bang for my buck... if only it vibrated. The girlfriend loves it!"
2,Not a Tripp Lite Cable,"Purchased a 200 ft. Tripp Lite Cat 5 cable... the only problem is, it's not a Tripp Lite cable, it's a SatMax. Can anyone say bait and switch.Cable works, but it's not what was advertised."
4,Good value,"It works fine, and it was cheap enough. The length. allowed me to relocate the wireless modem so I now can get decent WiFi speed on 3 of the 4. levels of my house.o"
2,love the part i got,well i only got 1 tape and the ad said 2-cd tape. please send me tape or book in replacement for the one i didn't get. thank you very much.
4,a good beginning,This book is a good beginning on Buddhism focusing on the Heart Sutra combined with the author's own personal experience. Worth having in hand to look at from time to time and remind you of what the core of Buddhism is all about.
2,"""Unbearable"" disappointment","Saki's style is Roald Dahl by way of P.G. Wodehouse, which sounds great, but he comes up far short on both counts, in my opinion. I did end up only skimming this book because nothing was grabbing me. The pervasive animal imagery is also not my thing. In ""Unbearable Bassington,"" I didn't get past the first couple of pages as the title character was already living up to his adjective too thoroughly. A pity, as I'd expected much, having recently come across a wonderfully glib Saki quote somewhere: ""A little inaccuracy sometimes saves a ton of explanation."" (A quick Googling finds that seems to be his best line; a couple of other good ones are ""He is one of those people who would be enormously improved by death"" and """"Think how many blameless lives are brightened by the blazing indiscretions of other people."")"
4,A visual feast,"A lovely feast for the eyes in a small-ish paperback book. There is very little text or explanation, but if you would like to revel in the rich hues of south India, you will probably enjoy this book. This is a photographic work rather than a travel guide. The book is divided into sections by color. I wish there had been more descriptions of the images."
4,Colors galore,"I have a large collection of India photographic books. It was a good idea to focus on color. The colors of India are magnificent and Barbara Lloyd has captured them nicely. I was disappointed that there was no mention of what equipment, technique or even what film was used."
3,broken latch,"These earrings are OK. They are pretty, but the latch on one of them was broken on arrival. I was able to fix it with some pliers."
4,A Good Example of Eddie's Staying Power,"Honestly, I thought this album would be mediocre because it is relatively far removed from Eddie Money's most prolific eras (late 70s to late 80s). However, I must give this guy credit for being able to produce a rock-solid album.It was apparent to me almost right away that a strong effort went into this album with my personal favs being, ""Run Right Back"", ""Fire And Water"", ""Prove It Every Night"". All three of these songs have some fantastic riffs and guitar work.Eddie Money comes across (to me, anyway) as a classy guy who puts a lot of energy into his tunes and he has proven himself to be a noteworthy figure of rock for the ages."
4,Decent Cups,"I think these are good baking cups, but I didn't realize that it's lined with paper on the inside, so it's not made completely of aluminum. This makes it harder to peel the cup from your muffin or cupcake. I suggest to spray olive oil or something before pouring in your mixture. What I love about them is that they did stay in shape during baking and did not stain."
5,I love it!,"Chris Ward is becoming one of my favorite chess authors....he is challenging, but remains humble and down to earth. Here, he lays out a series of chess puzzles, in a multiple choice format. His wording is trickier than the puzzles themselves, and makes you pay close attention. This is the type of book that tests your knowledge, and so what I am doing is this: I am taking all the tests, and recording the results. (pencil only). In 6 months, I will pick up the book again, and hopefully, will have seen an increase in chess strength. If not....well, I won't entertain that thought. My only complaint about Ward is that I cannot find enough books authored by him. Chris, if you read this: GET BUSY! I would love to see him annotate great games, with his comments directed towards the under 1800 folks! How about it?"
3,Interesting,I enjoyed the way the movie put me at ease. The men in the movie were very handsome. Hot eye candy and playful.
5,Why was I not told?,Why was I not told by anyone that there was a Christian band that sounded like the Dead Milkmen??? Now that I have this CD I'm so hooked on this band! I need to get their other material now.
5,Dork Rock at its Finest,"Calibretto 13 strikes again with this hard hitting mix of funny, fast, and thought provoking songs. my favorite happens to be Sheep in the USA. if you like punk rock, i'm sorry but its dead. out of the rubble comes Dork Rock with Weezer at the forefront and Calibretto 13 close behind!!!"
5,space,this is great i now have all the season and the picture qaulity is great this was one of my faverite show in it days and i still watch it
4,The End of The Series,"Well, I'm glad to finally own the complete DVD set of a series that is one of my all-time favorites...a favorite for reasons that I can't quite understand, never mind explain...but it is all great fun.I think that the quality of the DVD's are good...perhaps not the cleanest or the sharpest picture I've ever seen, and the audio is occasionally uneven (in other words, somewhat similar to volume one of season 3)...but overall definitely watchable.However, I did notice in the Space Princess episode that, slightly before the beginning of the coronation scene, the transfer seems to slip at the left side of the screen, and subsequently, there is a vertical line that moves from the left to the center of the picture for a couple of minutes. I would be curious to know if anyone else has a similar problem with their disc 1. I'd be interested to know if this is indeed a problem with the transfer, or if it is a defection just in the disc that I have. Thanks."
4,it is lost in space after all,"I agree with Twiddles review. I haven't seen the hippie episode in 20 years, but I still remember the music!!!"
2,Poor mastering - like watching an old video tape,"Whoever owns Season 1 and 2 on DVD will know what I mean when I say that the mastering afforded to them was quite good. However, in Season 3 it is as if Fox didn't care. Every episode is like watching an old dirty videotape. I cannot believe that Fox could not find better source material to bring the final season on DVD in a manner in which it deserves. The point of DVD technology is to view programs in more improved resolution over video tape.Avoid purchasing this season if you can ... wait for a reissue from Fox on Season 3 if that ever happes."
2,Memory better than watching it,"I remembered this series from when I was a kid (I guess everyone still does ""warning, warning--danger Will Robinson""). Sitting and watching a whole hour... eh."
4,The Memories Keep On Comin',"Lost In Space. When I was a kid, I NEVER missed an episode, and even rushed home from school a few years later to catch the reruns. When I got the shocking news after Season Three that the show was cancelled by CBS, I was crushed! Oh, the pain! I kept hoping for a ""reunion"" special or feature movie (a-la ""Star Trek"") to tie up the loose ends, but it was never to be. The Space Family Robinson is forever lost in space.Season Three was my favorite season way back when (though as I've grown older I appreciate Season One a lot more). This season had it all: A little bit of well-written sci-fi, mixed in with a whole lot of corny camp. I enjoyed the fact that Season Three allowed the Robinsons to spend more time flying through space and actually trying to get home, as opposed to being marooned on that dreadful and boring ""planet"".For the ""LIS"" fans, both young and old, these final episodes are indeed a treat well-worth the investment!"
3,Help with a song,What is the song being played when he kisses her for the first time at the high school party? RMGCMT75@aol.com Thanks.
3,Question,"What is the song that plays while they're in the limo after prom? I really really like it, please email me back katherinenewman@yahoo.com"
1,Missing All the Good Songs,"By the way... the song that was featured in the commercials for Confidence is called ""No One Knows"" by Queens of the Stone Age. The song is not in the movie tho."
3,"Why isn't ""The Darkness"" on the soundtrack?","A band called ""The Darkness"" has the high-pitched song featured in the TV commercials, and I think it's called ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love."" But for some stupid reason, it isn't on the soundtrack. It's not even listed on the IMDB as a song featured in the movie!I am having a hard time tracking down the cool, non-jazzy but rock song featured in the commercials for a movie called ""Confidence"" starring Dustin Hoffman. It's nowhere in the soundtrack and it's driving me nuts! Someone said it is done by Maroon 5, but I don't think so."
2,Please Help!!!,Hey... I saw that a lot of people are wondering what the song was when Danielle and Matt kissed for the first time. I am wondering as well. If anyone that knows could please post it; that would be fantastic. It's an awesome somg and it sounds so familiar!!!
3,Great movie but the soudntrack is missing great songs,"Hey yeah this moive was excellent. It had so many laughs and it was the perfect graduation movie, but im having troubles finding this one particular song and I was hoping someone could help me. Its the song thats playing when they go to the porn star convention. Its really bugging me."
3,ok OST,"Its a Ok OST and to answer travman200227, the song I think u mean is : Queen - Under Pressure"
3,Update on the songs,"The song from the house party and the Limo is David Gray's ""This Year's Love"" and is from his White Ladder album which is a great album.What I want to know is does anyone know the song from the end of the prom when they've finished filming. It sounds like The Who and has a great organ solo to begin with but I can't seem to find the song. Someone please help."
2,Good CD but songs are missing,"resshin31, I think the song you're looking for is ""Twilight Zone"" by 2 Unlimited. It's a good one."
2,where is the actual soundtrack??,"What about the song that played while they were in the limo, post-prom? I think it was by David Gray? It was played another time in the movie too...Anyone know the title?"
3,Name of a song.....,"Hey guys, I loved this movie and was hoping someone could help me get the name of the song playing in the background when Matt kisses Danielle for the first time (at the party). The same song is in the movie ""crazy/beautiful"" but I have no idea what the name of it is or who it's by. I'd appreciate any help."
2,Limo Song,The song when they are in the limo is by David Grey - This years love...i think mark kozelek covers it or somethin. Yall are welcome. Greeeeeat movie but crappy soundtrack
2,girl next door review,"the song you are talking about is ""Baba O'Riley"" by The Who. I hope you find it helpful. Its played at the time when Matthew is drivin his BMW Z4 to Georgetown University. I am 100% certain I'm right. Hope you find this helpful. james Walker (UK)"
3,Go back to find it....,All of us searching for the missing songs to this great film need to go back in the reviews to April 27th and 26th. Someone has listed every song and what scene in the movie it plays in. Hopes this helps.
3,Convention Song,I believe that the song for the entrance into the convention in Las Vegas is Looper - Mondo'77.
3,Ok havent actually listened but,"The movie was great, and in the music from it was also very good as well, so i guess this is a good soundtrack. However, i noticed the two best songs have been left out: Lucky Man by The Verve and This Year's Love by David Gray. Lots of people have asked what was the song when they first kiss and when theyre in the limo: it's This Year's Love by David Gray. The movie ups the tempo of the song a bit which is irritating, but if you liked the song, go buy David's album White Ladder: you won't be dissappointed!"
2,theme song,"hello, i couldnt find the theme song that was on the trailer for the movie if somebody knows the name of that song and/or the artist could you tell me or somthin.... thanks"
2,Teenage Wasteland,"One of the songs on the movie was Teenage Wasteland by The Who. Too bad they didn't include that on the soundtrack. Great movie, btw."
1,I hope they make another CD for this movie.,The movie is awesome but the CD really sucks. The person who made this CD must be an idiot because most of the songs that are in the movie are missing. Where is Under Pressure? I like that song a lot. But seriously they really need to make a new CD for this movie because this CD really blows. Do not waste your money.
2,WHERE ARE THE GOOD SONGS?????,I want to star by saying thank you to all who wrote the titles and artists of all the good songs. I too was dissapointed in the soudtrack because i like the movie so much. I'll use all your songs to make my own soundtrack.
2,This CD could have been great,"With all the great music they used in this movie, I was quick to buy it. It sucks. Thats putting it nicely.For all of those looking for the song that begins ""I DECLARE WAR ON STUPIDITY, WE'RE DROPPING BEATS AND A LYRICAL FLUIDITY""..its called Slayed by Overseer"
3,Girl Next Door,"The song that played while they kissed outside of the party is, ""This Year's Love"" by David Grey. This song is on his album ""White Ladder"". Great song, too bad they left it off the movie soundtrack."
3,Question about a song title,"The song played near the end of the movie, Matthew and Danielle are in the limo after prom. What is the name of the piano song playing in the background. Anything that can help, thanks."
3,Mystery song everyone is looking for...,"...I would assume is ""Arrival"" written by Mark Kozelek, formerly of Red House Painters, who then went solo, and is now front-man for Sun Kil Moon. I admit I have not seen the movie, but based on several other posts here, I am guessing it's the one.He wrote the song exclusively for the movie, and it's apparently not available anywhere.If you liked it by the way, and enjoy folk/acoustic/mellow music, you should really check out the following albums, they are phenomenal:Red House Painters' ""Songs for a Blue Guitar""Mark Kozelek's ""Rock 'n Roll Singer""Mark Kozelek's ""What's Next to the Moon""Sun Kil Moon's ""Ghosts of the Great Highway"""
3,PLEASE HELP ME WITH THESE SONGS,"I am looking for the names and artists of two songs. The first is when Matt, Danielle, Eli, and Klitts arrive at the keg party it sounds like rap music to a heavy metal beat it starts off, "" I DECLARE WAR ON STUPIDITY, WE'RE DROPPING BEATS AND A LYRICAL FLUIDITY"". The second song is when they all arrive at the prom the song right before N.E.R.D.'s ""lapdance"" song comes on, they are walking in and the song goes ""MY RECIPE IS JACK DANIELS, NON FILTERED CAMELS"". Any help that anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated"
1,The trailer song,"To Sean - I think you're looking for ""I believe in a Thing Called Love"" by The Darkness."
2,Please help too,"the soundtrack wouldn't be THAT bad, if they would used ALL music from the movie...but anyway:i know it was asked before but nobody gave an answer yet: whats he song when Danielle and Matt are kissing for the first time? The song with he piano in it....Thanks1"
2,Missing the best songs??,"Movie...GreatSoundtrack...decent but missing the best songsThe song at the prom when she thanks him is ""Lucky Man"" by The Verve. The song during the limo scene is ""This Year's Love"" by David Gray. How they can choose to leave out these 2 ""key scene"" songs is beyond me. Only good thing is that I'm now grabbing everything from David Gray. Definitely worth the journey. Trust me."
2,Where's the rest?,"I only gave this CD 2 stars because of Paul Haslinger's instrumental tracks which I like a lot. The other funk tracks are great but that theme was only a small part of the movie's true theme which was romance. None of the included tracks reflected that.This CD is missing key romantic music. What gives? Are they planning on another release? If so, they need to include the key music like David Gray's ""This Year's Love"". They should also include Danny Scherr's excellent closing credit track performed by Binocular ""Maybe You're Gone"". That song was the sole reason I even wandered to this page to look for the soundtrack. I was quite disappointed when that or the other romantic pieces were missing.I must thank the reviewer below John Wayne for pointing me in the right direction. I was able to get in touch with Danny Scherr and obtain that specific track (through Soundclick.com). It was worth every penny."
2,limo love scene song,"The song that people are looking for (from the limo love scene) is David Gray's ""This Year's Love""."
3,The song when they kiss!,the song is by an artist called David Gray he's massive in the UK!! cant believe u havent heard of him!adios
1,Disappointed in an understatement,"If you are entertaining the idea of purchasing this soundtrack based on what you heard in the movie, don't do it. Maybe two songs are easily recognizable and nice to have, but that leaves 17 songs that stink. If you buy the CD, you'll have to watch the movie again to realize that most of these songs are even in the movie. It's a very sorry soundtrack."
1,what the heck happened?,i baught the cd no questions asked because i thought it would be awesome like the movie but then i was seriosly disspointed when i heard it!!!
3,Song help,"I am trying to find out what this song is called, it's played towards the end, i would say in the last 10-15 minutes and it goes something like ""Ive been waiting on my own for too long... Sweep me off my feel, singing..."" If anyone knows it would be great! Thanks!"
2,Whats this song please,"the song starts with ""i'm an out law"" its a catchy beat and has a rock rap sould. I think when they go to to porn conven. If you know please hit me at herb_21@shaw.ca"
2,Great Movie Sad soundtrack,"The movie was great. Was kinda of realistic execept for the part that a nerd and a porn star fell in love, but i gave regular guys some hope. lol. anyway what was that song when the KID and THE GIRL were doin it in the limo. Its a good song to mellow out to."
2,i need help,i liked the movie but the soundtrack doesnt have the main song i wanted to hear. Does anyone know the name to the song that is playing when they first kiss at the party and they play it again when they have sex in the limo? i dont know the name.
5,Whats songs you're thinking of:,"Joseph is talking about ""Atlantis"" by Donovan, Repetetive lyrics or something. With that info you should find it quite easy.Joueliz is talking about ""Mondo 77"" from Looper. Which is also in the movie Vanilla Sky."
3,WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS SONG!?!?!,"this has been driving me crazy!!! alright when the movie first was previewed on tv, there was a song playin with a guy singing. at moments he was singing in a high voice.i have no idea who sings this and i really want to kno cuz its an awsome song... if anyone knows the name of the song PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE e-mail me at eimmmah14@aol.com and tell me thanks"
3,Travman......,"The song that you're wanting to know about is called ""Lapdance"" by N.E.R.D. It s a great song and I was kinda pissed they didint put it on the soundtrack..."
2,Baba not Teenage,The Canadian's review mentions Teenage Wasteland. The Who recorded no such song. The song is actually Baba O'Riley. My question is where is The Darkness? They are the best up and coming band and yet not on the soundtrack. That's why this album only gets two stars
4,That Song,"The song I think the people are looking for is ""Teenage Wasteland"" by The Who. I've listened to it and it sounds the same, although some parts dont sound the same so I'm wondering if any bands did a cover for the movie."
4,Limo Song,"The song missing from the soundtrack that plays twice, once the first time they kiss and again when they are having sex in the limo, is called ""This Years Love"" by David Grey. It's an awesome song! Most of other songs they put on the soundtrack are just instrumental background music you hardly even notice, rather than the good songs..."
3,Why missing such great songs?,"I think that this is a great soundtrack for an awesome movie that utilizes this music to tell the story. I hate that the song I love the most is missing-I believe it would be placed after Sweet Home Alabama where their finishing off each character's story (correct me if I am wrong). It has some awesome guitar riffs and says something like ""I'm getting far off plan."" (That's a guess). I just think that song is so cool that it should be on the soundtrack, I mean its even on the website! Please let me know if anyone knows the song.Thanks"

3,what is that song!?!?,"This movie was so great, but I was a little angry when i bought the soundtrack and the song i wanted to hear the most wasn't on it. Does anyone know the name of the song playing when they are walking into the house party? that would help me out so much."
3,Where are the actual songs from the movie?,"Great movie, but I don't see all the songs represented here. I would love to have the David Gray song(s) on this disc. For ""Don Conf"" the song you're curious about is ""Purple Haze"" by Groove Armada. It is on their Love Box release."
3,2nd Soundtrack?,"I was VERY disappointed that the soundtrack didn't feature ""This Year's Love"" or ""Baba O'Reilly"" those were two songs that played at VERY key points in the movie.My question is: ""Has anybody heard of maybe a second version of the soundtrack coming out?""The absence of those two songs were the reason I did not buy this albumn.Disappointed in the soundtrack....L-O-V-E the movie!!!!!!!!!!! How about a ""Girl Next Door 2"""
4,Good cd..........,"This is a good cd, but the music is so varied. But mostly good music throughout, and I would recommend."
3,Good Soundtrack,"Anyone who loves this movie will like this soundtrack. It has all of the songs you would want, minus one. The only one I have found to be missing is Lapdance by N.E.R.D which is the song playing in the background when they are at the prom. Its one of my favorites which is why I gave a 3 star rather than a 5."
2,Selections,"Some of the best tracks from the movie are not on the CD. I was disappointed, probably should have done more research myself."
3,ANYONE KNOW THIS SONG?,I am another one of those people who is looking for a song that plays during the movie but isn't on the soundtrack. I'm looking for the song that is played when the two first kiss.. anyone know?!
2,What a disappointment!,"This soundtrack is terrible, which is really surprising considering the music in the movie helped to make it a success (at least for me it did). Except that most every track that made me want to own this soundtrack does not appear on the track list. Hey, here's a good idea...why don't we take all the songs that have a significant impact on the film and not include them on the soundtrack? What in the world were these people thinking? I'm pretty sure that everyone who buys this soundtrack is going to come away disappointed. You may like the music that's on it, but it's definitely missing songs that should have been included."
2,"Songs in the movie= great, however soundtrack lacking","There were some great songs in the movie including several by the Who, Pete Yorn, David Gray, etc. that did not make the soundtrack. However, all of the filler music from the movie (the music w/o any words written as background to the scenes) did make the album. THe album still features some popular good stuff like something in the air (thunderclap newman), take a picture (filter), and sweet home alabama (skynard) as well as one lesser known song sparrows over birmingham (josh rouse) but if you're expecting the music from the movie, you'll be disappointed."
2,ALERT! The heart of The Girl Next Door is Missing!!!,"The four best songs of the movie are missing from this CD. The most prominent absence is David Gray's This Year's Love. The others are the songs playing as the main characters walk into the house party, as they enter prom, and during the closing montage. VERY disappointing for anyone who loved the movie and wanted to enjoy the whole soundtrack . . . better invest in another four CDs and use a carousel. A word of advice to moviemakers . . . find a way to get all the songs on the CD if you want a good review."
3,Not bad could be better,"Movie is a good movie, the soundtrack is lacking. They didnt include all the good songs and they even added a couple that werent in the film."
2,Song Title not in list at bottom,"Hey anyone know name of song/artist. I think name is ""teenage wasteland"" however can't seem to find song name anywhere. Any help offered would be a help."
3,HELP ME PLEASE!!,I loved the movie but the soundtrack was disappointing. I was really mad that they did not put the song when they are in the limo near the end of the movie. That is the best song in the entire movie. If anyone knows what it is called or who it is by could you PLEASE email me at Bogurl238@aol.com. Thanks so much!
4,HELP ME PLEASE!!!!,there is a song playing when the main character is running down the road. sry im not more specific. the song is played multiple other times throughout the movie. WHAT IS THIS SONG? If u know could u please e-mail me at crazyboarder@yahoo.com
2,I need help with lyrics,"I've decided to make my own soundtrack, thanks to the list that was posted in one review on 27 April by Josh Lowrance, so I'm downloading the songs, but for some of them I did not find the lyrics.

3,Hey I need Help,"There is a song near the start of the movie that has the line ""since I seen your picture on a hundred dollar bill"" thats all I can pick out, if you know what song I'm talking about will you please help me out?????"
2,????,"Whats that song when elisha, mat and his friends start walkin in the party, not prom, the party where mat first kisses danielle, its rap sorta rockish.....????

3,song,"Does anyone know the song at the end of the movie when they leave the prom and go into the limo? It's hard to hear what they say but it sounds something like, ""way down by the ocean,"" but i know that's not exactly what they say. I'm not talking about the David Gray song, and not the Verve song."
2,This CD could of sold alot more if...,"This CD could of sold alot more if it had the songs eveyone is talking about it missing. Such as The Who , The Darkness, NERD, and also Mondo '77 ""Looper"" which for everyone who doesnt seem to know is the song for the porn convention in the Movie not Trailer and if it sounds familiar its from the Vanilla Sky soundtrack."
4,under pressure,"that song i was wanting to know ISNT IN THE MOVIE but i d like to know it anyway. its a more rock song than under pressure and the chorus goes ""and now that ur here, we all run away and the beat goes de dunanana de dunanana de. help!"
1,song title,"the best tracks were overlooked. nuff said.spanky, the song you're looking for is called ""suffering"" by satchel. it's on the natalie portman movie ""beautiful girls."" it also made the soundtrack on that one."
3,HELP!,"The soundtrack is great, I love it, but its missing songs like David Grey for example. So I gave it a 2, since there are some songs in the soundtrack I enjoy listening to. Anyways, I like the movie alot, but there are some songs that I don't know what they're called. I hope you guys could help me out;The songs I'm looking for are in the trailer (www.thegirlnextdoormovie.com). The first one is when Danielle honks Matt when he was semi naked. It sounded rock..The second one is when Eli was about to tell Matt, Danielle is a porn star. From what I heard, it sounded like, It's a knockout, drop your top out or something like that.The third one is when Matt enters the the convention and there's a techno-like music.Note that all the songs are from the trailer! So help would gladly be appreciated!"
2,missing songs,"The song i was really looking for was Slayed by Overseer, But i cant find the song that comes on the part when they walk in the dance floor all of them, it sounds like a Neptunes beat, or Pharrell in it, ANy HelP????"
4,Please Help,"I'm looking for the song that is in chapter 21 on the DVD. She is in a white robe and he is sitting at the kitchen table. The music to the song starts after he is at the front door and says "" I'm in big trouble"""
2,Missed the Good Songs,"I agree with a lot of people who listened to this soundtrack. It could have better songs, and it is more of an afterthought.I was also wondering what song is played during the trailer. I like it a lot, and was just curious."
3,song name?,"Hey i was watching the movie and i really liked the song when the guy first see's danielle, where shes walking to her house and he runs into the garbage cans. thanks :)"
2,End of Prom Song,"The song played at the end of the prom when they are getting into the limo is called ""Atlantis"" By Donovan. I hope this info helps everybody looking for this song."
2,David Gray,"The song which plays when Matt and Danielle kiss at the party is ""This Year's Love"" by David Gray. That the one that says ""When you kiss me, in the midnight street. sweep me off my feet."" Etc. Goodness me i love that song :o) WOuld anyone happen to know the song that plays when they dance at prom. Something about ""I'm lucky man."" My AIM is Strngelilgrl41 if you would rather contact me that way because im not sure ill check this very often. Thank you!"
3,Missing songs-- especially the good ones,"Considering how bad this movie was the soundtrack is pretty good, infact several of the songs enhanced particular scenes.I realized that there are songs in the movie that aren't listed in the soundtrack, that include Elliot Smith's ""Angela"" and N.E.R.D's ""Lapdance"", what's up with that?"
2,War on Stupidity,"This soundtrack is kinda bad, I loved the movie though. Could some one please tell me what the song is when she is walking into the party. ""I declare war, on stupidity"" It sounds wicked but i dont know what song it is if some one could help me out that would be great Thanks"
3,What's that song called?,"what's the song called when they arrive at the party where matt kisses her for the first time??Before David Gray's.email the name and artist to ; thewilsonator@hotmail.complz that would be great, thx!"
3,The song when he picks her up for the prom,The song title for when he picks her up for the prom is Muddy Waters - Mannish Boy
2,Where are all the great songs?,"There were so many songs in the movie that don't appear on this soundtrack. For example, Elliot Smith, Pete Droge, Pete Yorn and of course David Gray. The last artist's song was played TWICE in the movie (it's called ""This Years Love"" off of Gray's White Ladder for the reviewer who asked). This soundtrack comes off as an afterthought. One of those ""Inspired By The Motion Picture"" style pieces of junk. I gave it a two because it has more cuts than the average movie soundtrack. Plus, I actually liked the film. Too bad the best and most memorable music was omitted."
1,"Great Soundtrack, [...] soundtrack","This movie has brilliant music in it. The Verve, Queen, David Gray etc, however, seeing as it's a teen movie they've put all the crap songs on the soundtrack. So don't buy it. Instead go get the individual songs... just so you'll be able to live with yourself...best song in this movie definitely is ""This Year's Love"""
3,Here's the Song your looking for,"The song thats playing twice, whenm they're kissing the first time at the party and then at the end in the limo is called ""This Year's Love"" by David Gray."
2,Many good songs out of this item,"The song with the girl-guy in the limo when they are making up, its called This years love by David Gray. Another good song is Angeles by Elliot Smith, Under Presure - David Bowie, one Fine Day Alastair Brinks, Barba O'Riley The Who, Maybe You're Gone by Binocular, Suffering by Satchel. None of this songs are included in the soundtrack... see what i mean!"
3,The songs you want.......,The good songs that you hear/notice in the movie are:Elliot Smith - Angeles (at the beginning)*David Grey - This Year's Love (when they kiss at party/havesex)*The Verve - Lucky Man (when they dance at prom)The Who - Teenage Wasteland (or Baba O'Reily) (credits)Sparrows over Birmingham (by Josh Rouse) andTurn of the Century (by Pete Yorn) are also pretty good.Only one of these songs are on the soundtrack so don't buy it!
3,Driving Me Crazy!!,"I was suprised like everybody else, so many of the best songs were left off this. It was a great movie that was made even better by the music, one of the best songs was during the end credits called ""Maybe You're Gone"" by Binocular. Does anyone know where I can find this??? I have looked everywhere and all I've found was the original version by Danny Scherr. It isn't on any albums and of course not on this soundtrack -- If anyone knows PLEASE email me! (Email= close59956@hotmail.com)"
1,soundtrack could have been better.,This soundtrack could have been 5 stars if they just put in the good songs everyone remembered from the movie.like.David Grey - This years loveElliott Smith - Angeles
3,I need help to find a song,"I'm looking for a song that is in the movie but I think it's not in the album, its in the part when matt kiss danielle for the first time in a party"
2,terrible representation of the movie,"This was one movie that the songs actually jumped out at you and you sang along...however don't buy the soundtrack expecting to get those songs! Whoever was in charge of putting this soundtrack together really musta had no intention of selling any because it is a very poor represention of the movie. David Gray's THIS YEARS LOVE is in the movie twice (!) but not on the soundtrack! Go figure! This CD actually has alot of the true movie ""sound tracks"" meaning instumentals (no words)that they put in during certain scenes in the movie. Which for me is a disapointment!"
1,wot's that song?,I have to say this soundtrack was rather disapointing! There were many songs in it that i didnt even recognise from the movie. I felt that at least the David Grey number would have appeared. Does anybody know the one being played when they walk into the strip club?
2,um,"does anyone know the song playing when they're pulling up and going into the porn convention. i've heard it before, i just don't know the title or the artist."
3,this years love,the song that is playing when matt and danielle are in the limo is the original. no one covered it
2,"""Teenage Wasteland""","logan, this is by far one of the greatest songs in rock'n roll history. The artist is - ""The Who"", and the song is called ""Baba O'Riley"", you can find it on their album titled: ""Who's Next"". And if you like The Who, then you have to see ""Quadrophenia"" and ""Tommy""."
3,WHATS THAT SONG?,"again i think they have missed some good songs from the film, does anyone know what the song is they play after she walks away from him at the hotel, if anybody knows what its called or knows where i can get it please contact me at madhead63@hotmail.com"
2,WHAT IS THAT SONG!?!,"omg people this has been driving me nutz! if anybody could help, it would b greatly appreciated. alright when the movie first was previewed on tv, there was a song playin with a guy singing. at moments he was singing in a high voice. song seemed more punk/rock. i have heard it on the radio, but never catch the name or artist. if sum1 could help me out it would b awesome. hud_02@hotmail.com is a way to get a hold of me cuz i dont know how often ill b on here, but go ahead and post it on here too. thanks!"
1,Not Pleased,These songs sound terrible is like if they used a tape recorder to record them while they were watching the movie.
5,Not just for the ladies...,"This book is an insightful and humorous take on the oft- overlooked area of pre-dating. While it appears that this book is intended for the hottie huntress out there, my friends and I found it useful for determining our own categorization. It was also invaluable as a guide of 'what-not-to-do' in efforts to appear attractive to the opposite sex. Now while I am sure the author has written this guide with her tongue planted firmly in-cheek, I can't help but marvel at the real-world practicality of it. With humor and whimsy, Ms. Gilford seems to have achieved what no other 'dating' book could - she forced us to not take ourselves to seriously. This book makes a great gift for the girl who keeps dating the wrong guys, or the guy who can't seem to get any girls."
1,Not high quality,This product was very difficult to work with. Extremely crumbly and tasted disgusting. It was using the Wilton fondant products that made me seek out other options for fondant.
4,Useful,"A very useful book for beginners. When learning massage, practise is far more important, but this book explains very clearly the different techniques and sequences. The drawings may look a bit outdated but are self-explanatory and useful."
4,"Muddled, but comprehensive","This was the only general massage book I've found that included everything I wanted to know. There were a great many techniques and useful supplementary information. The only way in which it is lacking is that it is too dense. The techniques, though useful, are so closely packed that it's really difficult to extract a good routine. It can be done, surely, but it will take a little patience."
5,Best Massage Miami,South Miami Massage Therapy is the best in-house massage in the Miami area. Aaron Hettinger provides an honest therapeutic session to meet and exceed clients' needs. [...]
4,Very informative,"Haven't used anything out of it yet, but just flipping through the images and description are easy to follow and understand. Covers a LOT of stuff!"
3,Good strategy,"Good book to start with, but you need the practice on different people to get different feedback. Try to find those people who are hard to please."
4,Very good intro to massage,"I borrowed this from a friend a while back, mostly on a whim. It's a very good introduction to massage, with illustrations that are helpful, and interesting sections such as child massage and self-massage. Like the title says, it covers different methods of massage, which is helpful, and then you get to pick and choose because some work better than others. There's nudity in the photographs, but it's nothing very risque. After reading the book I applied the techniques to my friends when they were stressed out, and they kept coming back for more, which is the best praise you can get. :-)"
3,"A ""Nice"" Intoduction to Massage","As a connoisseur of massages and a practitioner I thought to get this book for a friend of mine who is beginning their own massage practice. Although the title promises alot, it really just gives you the following information:-Basic Western Massage (Basic Body rub techniques)-Shiatsu-ReflexologyThere are many of other disciplines I would have liked to see covered, but for fundamentals it is a good beginners book. It gives you the basics and some common sense advice on creating an environment and why human touch is so important. The illustrations are easy to understand, and the artist conveys the sensuality of touch very well. If you want an introductory book this is one to get, especially for the novice and beginning masseur/masseuse."
3,A Satisfactory Material,"This book provides substantial information on massage which tend to be a bit overwhelming, especially on the Eastern techniques. Beginners may need something more basic than this, but those who are way ahead in the art of massage will benefit more in this book. More illustrations than photographs are contained here, which give the reader an idea of how the techniques go. In most cases, however, photographs could've been more helpful in conveying its contents. All in all a satisfactory material."
4,"""The best book of massage""","This is a very good basics resource. Good illustrations that match the content. Excellent descriptions of massage strokes and tips for oilos, setting the mood etc. This is the book that everyone should have on their shelf for massage!"
2,"Badly dated material, pretentious, hard to follow","This book appears to have been created many years ago and now looks its age. The techniques are disorganized and the book includes many pages of questionable and hard to figure out ""options."" The author was showing off and we readers must wade through page after page of needlessly difficult massage instructions. The art seems dated too and is poorly done. Much of the book is devoted to ""Shiatsu"" a Japanese therapy that can be very painful and doesn't belong in a massage book. To summarize: a little useful material here and there but many techniques employing ""pressure points"" and similar quackery. Really not worth your time."
3,The Book of Massage,"The book is informative with fine pictures giving every aspect of the description. The books gives the idea of the 'healing science', even to the layman for whom, massage is a new subject.thanks,Dr.Maulik Vyas"
2,"Bizarre ""eastern"" massage mixed with some useful stuff","A little good massage and many, many pages of ""filler"" taken from hard-to-understand so called ""eastern"" massage. Potentially pressure points instead of relaxing strokes. Very little real sensuality here. Not worth the effort it will take to separate the useful massage technique from the author's need to impress you with her vast knowledge of obscure practices."
4,Good Book,"I have read through most of this book. It gives good information about massage and how to apply it. The more you practice, the better you get."
2,"It's ok, not worth the trouble",I was so excited to get the solar system for my toddlers room. I was really disappointed. I think the light that the sun omits is too subtle and the installation is difficult if you are not interested in using the huge drywall screws. It is a great concept not utilized properly. Don't waste your money.
3,"It's OK, but really loud","I bought this for my son's ""space room"" for his 5th birthday. Agreed that it does look cool, but the motor is ridiculously loud and like other reviewer's, I thought maybe something was wrong at first. Luckily, the rotation shuts off rather quickly, and it's just as fun to light it up. It's OK, just not great."
2,Battery-hog!,"This thing is pretty unimpressive. It blazes through batteries, it's flimsy and and dimly lit--even at full charge. (Oh yeah, it takes 3 C-batteries. Just what I wanted, an odd number of the least prevalent cell at any store.) Wish I had researched this better. Oh yeah, Saturn touches Jupiter on every orbit, noticeably slowing the whole thing down. Meh."
3,nice for decoration but not good for light,this adds alot of fun to the room but is not any brighter than a night light and u should know the planets do not light up or glow they do spin but in the dark u cant see this feature & saturns ring is made out of cardboard. i was displeased but kept the item because my son loved it and its hs happiness with the item that counts. just be prepared to purchase a lamp too. i also purchased the moon in my room with this item and love it! these 2 items go very well together.
2,hard to see,Pros:Easy installation. We have beams in the house so instead of screwing to the drywall ceiling we just hung the toy with strings to the beam. Worked very well.Cons:Very small.Very dimly lit sun. The planets are barely visible.The light bulb needs to be a bit brighter & the planets need to emit some light as well. The effect was not what we were hoping for! Not that great of a product!
3,Uncle Milton,This is only ok. Kind of cheap. The wires are very thin and bend to easy. They get stuck and than the thing won't turn. Wouldn't get anain.
2,One HUGE Flaw,"I bought this prodct for my son's nursery. I was so excited to receive it (I want him to be an astronaut when he grows up) I was pleased with putting it together and hanging it, would have been better if it fit over an existing light ceiling fixture. The worst part is that the electric motor in it is LOUD!!! You can't even hear the audio disc that came with it unless you turn it up VERY loud. Needless to say I was really bummed, but way too lazy to return it and get my money back. Probably why its only 30 bucks. You also can't turn on the light without the planets orbit motor on."
2,Solar System Not Sending Me to the Moon!,"This product is not what it seems. When reading online one might think that it simply fits over or is the yellow globe of the ceiling light already in place, but this is not the case. The old light must come down. Then the problem is with the light. Without an overhead light the room is going to be really dark. The light that is produced through the sub is anything but sunny. We still like the product for the educational value and it looks good enough, but it is a real problem when it comes to light."
1,Not what I accepted,This item is poorly built and does not spin around like it is supposed to. My home school class was very disappointed in this product.
3,Its a night ligh!,I was disappointed to open the box and see that it is a batterie operated night light. I thought that it was going to be real light that I could wire up to the ceiling fixture. I kept it because it goes well with the theme of the room but now I have to get a real light for the room.
2,OK !,"My 4 years old daughter is extremely excited to see the package arriving. My husband had put them together and it was easy and fast! therefore the motor makes LOUD NOISE. First day, my daughter was happy to see all the planets spinning on her ceiling. After that day, we had no interested to play with it! About the CD in the package. What is the point? Anyways, it is ok over all!"
3,COULD HAVE BEEN MORE,"THE CD GIVES THE TOY THE VALUE IN MY OPINION, BUT THIS THING ONLY LIGHTS UP AND NOT THAT BRIGHT AS IN PICTURE, THE TINY PLANETS SPIN AROUND SLOWLY, I'M JUST NOT IMPRESS, BUT SINCE MY SON LOVES ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE SOLAR SYSTEM, I GUESS I'LL SETTLE FOR THIS ONE, IT WOULD BE GOOD IF THEY HAD SOME SOUNDS COMING FROM IT AND A ACTUAL REFLECTION FROM THE SO-CALL SUN UNTO THE PLANETS.PS: I GUESS THIS SUCKER WAS MAKE IN CHINACOME ON AMERICANS, WE NEED TO START MAKING THINGS, I KNOW WE COULD MAKE IT ""MO BETTER."""
3,"Great, but just stopped working for no reason after a few days","We got this for my daughter for Christmas. She was so thrilled about it and had a blast putting the planets in order with us. She used it nightly for a few days, but then it just wouldn't turn on. We thought maybe she used it too much and the batteries ran down (though we were a little annoyed that the batteries only lasted a few days). After changing both the batteries in the system and the remote, it still won't work. We have no idea why and she is devastated. We will replace it with the same system, only since there aren't similar ones, but we're going to just cross our fingers this one isn't a dud too."
3,The Solar System in MY Room,"Overall I think this is an easy project to teach about the Solar System. There were a few suprises though. Some minor construction is required to hang the sun. You have to drill holes in the ceiling in order to hang the prodcut. This was not an issue for me but may be for some. Otherwise the product went together nice and easy and is now hanging in my child's room. It has spawned conversations about how fast the planets rotate and how long days, months and years are on other planets compared to earths'. One other note, it chews through batteries pretty fast while spinning. They are easy to change though. It is fragile and not for young children. However 9+ and interested in space is a great age for this product. I would reccomend it! Enjoy!"
4,Good Buy,I bought this for my kid's room about a month ago. It does what you expect. It's easy to put together. The screws included in the box are not ideal but I bought better screws from Home Depot. The light inside sun is very dim so at night you can not see the planets unless room light is on. Other than that it's a good product.
4,Solar System Light,Was pleased with the overall quality. It makes a little noise when it turns that kind of bugs. The light isnt to bright (more of a night light). Quality is Good and there were no problems with shipping (good packaging).
2,Not so great,"I think it is a great concept, however, it is not what I thought it would be. It is terribly boring and leaves you wondering...this is it?"
4,"Noisy, but way cool!","I love it, and my son does too. It is quite loud -- I could maybe replace the motor.... But he runs it for 20 minutes as he's falling asleep, and the noise level seems to be ok for him. The solar system shuts off after 20 minutes and the moon shuts off after 30 min, so it works well as a pre-bedtime thing. When I saw the photo on the box, I assumed it went over the room lamp, but it doesn't. You need to drill two holes in the ceiling to mount it (really one would do). Also, I recommend using the next size up drill bit -- 3/8"". I bent the (cheap) toggle bolt trying to install."
2,Flimsy and loud,"My daughter is 4 and really into the solar system, she knows all the planets and this was a gift that we were excited about at first. I have to say that after much anticipation, we were very disappointed. First of all when you put it together is seems really flimsy, like the planets will break the wires they are hung on. Then you put it up and turn it on, the sun is dim and the motor that turns the planets is really loud. And when the planets turn, sometimes they get hung up on one another. The audio CD that comes with it is kind of cool, but overall, this get a thumbs down from this family."
1,"Unreliable, poor quality and noisy.","Had a lot of anticipation for this toy, but was let down quickly. Setup was easy, put the wires, planets and batteries in. Worked for the first 2 attempts, then nothing. Dead. Nada. Clicking the remote would not turn it on.. Changed out the (already new) batteries for another new set on both sides - still nothing. Verified that the IR emitter was working - it was. I am a very technical person and immediately took this thing apart to look at its guts.. Verified that all components had the necessary voltage - seemed ok. Shoddy overseas work with poor quality soldering, cheap components etc. Oh, and when it did work, the motor is very loud. I would not pay any more than $10 for this (provided it works)... When I get time, I'll hack in a new ATTiny85 and build my own controller.."
1,Uncle Milton = cheap toys & no customer service,"We bought this for our son and less than a year later, the remote stopped working (yes, even with new batteries:) I emailed Uncle Milton to see how I could buy another remote - their customer service dept said they were currently out of stock, but I should email next week to inquire. I did so, but received no response. I continued emailing week after week for a couple months and received no responses from Uncle Milton. I couldn't find any phone number for this company so it's apparent they want to sell their cheap toys (which are good concepts while they work) and then make you re-buy it again. If you're comfortable spending the money for a year's worth of use, I'd recommend. However, try explaining to your 6 year old that you can't get a new remote because the company that made the cool solar system won't call you back - not cool!"
5,Very Inexpensive! Saved a lot.,All you need to know is that Duke's bookstore was selling this USED at $89.50 and new at $156. I got used for $43 from here. Nothing beats that.
3,You're probably required to buy this book for a Multivariable Calc class,"I used this textbook for my Multivariable Calculus class at Duke University and found it to be quite unhelpful and a bit confusing. It's just a standard textbook, but I didn't like some of the notation and it gets a bit wordy sometimes. The practice problems are challenging though, but I supplemented learning the material with online MIT lecture videos."
5,Essential Kitchen tool,"Forget those rubber floppy ""grips"" or the plastic toothed band...this is the product every kitchen must have for opening those stubborn jars. It has several different layers of steel-toothed grips at different diameters, and will grasp from the tiniest to the largest jar cap that I have found. (Along with this, be sure to purchase the jarpop jar opener...a VERY handy device that pops the vacuum that holds the lid down, when you have a previously unopened jar.) This tool also helps if a jar has been in the refrigerator and gets slippery from the cold and moisture when taken out. I have had one of these tools for several years, and recently bought several to give to friends. Once you have this you will wonder why you waited to long to discover this great tool!"
4,UTP Compilation review,"I thought this CD was overall a decent album. Juvenile did his thang behind the boards for basically just beginning to produce. Skip shows the skills that have been on the underground in the N.O. for a while. Young Buck is impressive. His drawl isn't as exaggerated as it seems to be in all his G-Unit joints. If you like Juvenile, this is a must have because his crew is on the come-up....if not, you probably want to shy away from this one."
3,juvenile rule,juvenile u r the best all your cd in excelend i got all your cdcome to israel DAVID SHEMESH AKA 3
2,32 degreez,"Juvie, Juvie, Juvie. We all know you're one of the most talented rap dudes to come out the South. Rap dudes! But homie your production is let's just say, ""less than impressive"". Under the tutelage of Mannie Fresh huh? You must not have been paying attention, bruh. Your new mob is aiight though. I like Skip a lil' bit. He gotta different type flow that's understandable and witty. I copped his joint, it wasn't that bad. But dog, we're used to your joints being crunk all the way thru. If you have to enlist the Medicine Men (formerly BBTP) or something do that. I'm sure they'd love to lay it down for you. Cuz this joint was the total opposite of hot, no offense."
2,bland....,"Sorry-this one's a stinker-implausible storyline, very inaccurate historical details and one dimensional characters. I quit it at about 50 pages in. This one was one of Zebra's last published Regency line romances-and it shows. From the poor writing, to the horrible ""chick lit"" style cover they were obviously trying to cash in on in 2005, you can see why the line went under."
4,"Too bad Sony is not supporting SACD, cause its great","I really enjoy this SACD, as it is a great performance and the sound is quite good. I'm happy with the stereo as well as the multichannel version. I wish that there were follow up discs."
4,3.5 stars - a fun throwback rock n' roll album,"2006's Luv Machine is the debut album from Whitestarr, a California-based band featuring second generation rockers (the band includes Roy Orbison's son and Dickie Betts Jr.). The band's sound is pretty straightforward rock n' roll with an obvious appreciation for their classic rock roots. I hear a lot of Rolling Stones here, but there are also elements of T-Rex, the Black Crowes and even Tesla on a song or two.Luv Machine isn't the most original album around, but it's a totally solid, totally enjoyable throwback to the classic rock era. It's fun, and that counts for a lot, especially these days. I'm probably not moved enough to shout Whitestarr's praises from the rooftops, but I certainly don't regret picking Luv Machine up from the cutout bin. If you're a classic rock fan and have a couple of bucks to risk, you could do a lot worse than this disc."
1,Slick pics but not worth the money,"I paid quite a bit of money for this book, and got the usual stuff. Color pictures of dogs standing around, and breed standards. Oh yeah, and lots of Carl's personal comments on everything from who he knows to what he likes to eat. Don't make the same mistake I made. Just borrow the book from a friend or the library - don't pay the price."
3,Comments,"This book is full of nice color photos which I find appealing. The type is annoyingly large as if it is a child's book. The writing style is too informal -- as if it was an internet post rather than a lasting publication. The author feels that he is discovering things that to others are probably well known, and while not a breeder wants to rename breeds for the American market. The Pressa section, for example, could use way more depth and perhaps should have been written by the guy he visited in the Canary Islands. I still find it a worthwhile book -- as the photos are good as is some of the information. Much of the text could be pruned -- but then he would have to find stuff to fill space with. It is not as dense/rich, for example, as an Edward Tufte book. It gives a nice starting point for more in-depth internet reading."
2,"""A Must For The Serious Student Of Carl Semencic""","Not much info on the dogs, but more than you ever wanted to know about the man who wrote it. A nice book for the ""not so serious student"" of the breeds."
3,Casual and opinionated- but a rare book on the topic.,"Yes this is a simple book. Yes it reads like a grandpa telling you his wartime stories in the backyard. Yes the photos looks like those taken off of a traveler's album. No this is not a major academic work on the subject. BUT ... Yes, this is also the only book I've seen on rare breeds such as the Boerboel. Yes, this is the only book that I've seen to dare show pictures of fighting dogs in action. Yes, the author made an attempt on his free vacation time to visit places that no other have shown before as it relates to the subject of fighting dogs. No, the book is not a waste of money for those inclined to have a ""bulldoggy"" book on their shelf. After all, it's about supply and demand........and the supply on this subject is still few. Until more comprehensive books are published, Dr. Semencic is still the leading authority in terms of relaying this information to the public outside of cyberspace."
1,What happened?,"... I'm a big fan of Steve Winwood and of Traffic, but this album is the worst thing he's ever put out, and the only one by him that I've disposed of. There are no standout tracks. It's all mind-numbingly bland, white-bread pop An artist finds love or finds religion, and is so blissfully happy that he loses touch with the other emotions needed to make real, well-rounded art. I'm happy for him, but his gain is our loss. Avoid this CD."
1,A truly horrible CD...,"And what makes it horrible is that his other CDs were soooooooo good. To echo what one reviewer said, I can't even think of a memorable song from this one, as I can from any of his other CDs. A lot of happy poppy tunes, that show no real talent or imagination. This is no ""Back in the high life"" or ""Arc of a Diver"", not to mention anything from Traffic (even that reunion CD was better than this). Lets hope he does better on his next one."
5,You Will Have Some Fun,I had purchased this used at a record store nearby I had expected something horrible out of this CD from the reviews I had read but I was incorrect this CD is packed with surprisesWinwood collaborates with 3 people in thisSongwriter Narada Michael Walden + Steve's long time friend Jim Capaldi + Steve's Wife Euginia WinwoodThis has a mixture of extremely danceable songs + Winwood's nice calming blue eyed soul pop we all know.When I mean extremly danceable I mean If you listen to the entire album and not feel like you want to dance then there is something wrong with you .I do recommend you buy this album if you are new to Steve Winwood or if you are a long time listener
3,Lets us roam,"Living with horses for more than 15 years this DVD supposing about horses, reviles for a defiant fact, the fractious behavior of mankind toward this beautiful and gentle creature.The outrages acts of BLM in the name of management reminds me on the ""acts"" and managements of native Indian in America that brought them almost to physical extermination and for spiritual dome.I was shocked by the torture of Horses shown driven into cages tracks and round pans the horses terrifying eyes shivering bodied bringing spirit to self-inflicting death.This is not really about horses it is about the destruction nature of humans and deceptions of governmental agencies, the horse serves here only as victim.I recommend this film to everybody who cares and have influence to change man attitude towards nature."
2,Cheap Pan! What do you expect for 12 bucks?,"1st time I used the pan, the handle broke off. Amazon replaced it quickly and without a problem. However, it is a pain to mail defective item back."
2,Loose handle,I bought this back in November 2006. It's always had a loose handle which btw could never be tightened and the pan had a ding in it but I didn't want the hassle to send it back. About 2 months ago the handle just fell off. Well I'm going to try another one but I'm seeing someone elses handle fell off as well. Maybe they've improved them. Other than the above I love how it cooks but things still stick to the pan. For the price it's great!
2,"12 1\2"" T-Fal Skillet",The first skillet I received was dented in shipping. Very poorly packaged. Amazon sent a replacement. I like it very much. cooks beautifully and is a very cool color.
3,poor quality picture,"More Alpha poor picture quality, especially HOUSE OF THE LIVING DEAD. Story was good. Haven`t watched TERROR AT RED WOLF INN."
3,"WRINKLED, AND NOT IN A CUTE WAY","This came wrinkled, and not in a cute crinkly rice paper lamp sort of way. There's two huge ""seams"" in the shade from where it was folded.The amount of light is great for a bedroom or a reading nook, but if you're using this in your home office or something you'll need supplemental light."
3,Very Disappointing,"I was somewhat disappoionted with the quality of this product. The paper shade is very cheap looking, but once the light is on it does look a lot better. If I could redo it again, I would not have ordered this product, but it does serve it's purpose. To end on a positive note, it is very easy to assemble."
3,fun for the pool but not sturdy,"This ball and hoop pool toy is fun for all ages although it is a little difficult for small children. The toy is not very sturdy and will not stand up to rough-house play. It is also awkward to store since it takes up LOTS of space in the pool storage closet. I think it was worth the price for my teenagers to play with their friends, but I don't know that smaller children would be entertained for very long. It's actually difficult to hit the hoop and smaller children would probably get frustrated. The floating ring toss is also fun, but difficult. We didn't use the ""swim to the bottom and pick it up"" toys, so can't comment on those. Overall, it was fine for our use."
3,Adult tent,"Arrived on time ,was worth the money spent per-se' lol.....Just wasn't that well constructed ,no sleeves for the tent poles to slip into ,just an few nylon like shoelace to tie the poles to the inner tent lol...And i used one 11oz tube of DAPS Exterior Acrylic Siliconized Clear 35 yr caulk mixed with 2/3 of an gallon of water ,brushed liberally unitill soaked ,3 seperate times lol..."
3,Shipping weight woes,"I was searching for a lightweight tent to purchase for my son and was careful to ensure the shipping eight was under 4 pounds. This was supposed to be 3 pounds, so I purchased the item, but when it arrived it was 5 pounds because they had put it into a box twice the size of the item which added extra weight. This extra pound cost me more than twice the amount in fees and duty charges to clear the item when it came. I hope this item meets with my expectations according to previous reviews and that it serves my son's purpose."
1,Not a Two Person Tent,"This tent will provide enough sleeping space for one short adult in a sleeping bag, maybe two young kids in sleeping bags. It is very small. I wish I had seen the reviews before I bought this tent, the description on Amazon is misleading. I have two other two person tents, and when I saw a tent listed as a two person tent, I imagined it would be a similar size. Very disappointed.As well, the internal frame makes it more difficult to put up, and I fail to see any benefit to it."
1,Not the color shown. Customer service not helpful,I purchased this tent for my sons room (not actually for camping). When I got it it was bright blue not green and tan as shown. Customer service said my color setting only screen must be wrong. Unless grass is actually blue as well I think my color setting was right... They would take it back but there was a huge restocking fee and I had to pay shipping so I actually would loose money sending it back. I guess it will be in our next yard sale.
3,Too Small,This is a kid's tent suitable for 5 feet and below. My 6 year old son will fit inside but not my 11 year old daughter.
3,Good tent but VERY SMALL,"I bought this tent knowing that it was a small tent but when I got it and set it up it turns out it was way smaller than I thought, I could not sleep in it because It was too short. Also the poles being internal makes it a pain to set up"
3,"small, cheap materials, easy to put up",This is a light weight small tent (note I don't backpack so take my definition of light weight in that context)I did not actually expect it to sleep 2 adults but it is much closer to the size of a tent for a child.When I unpacked the tent for the first time I thought that the internal poles would be a total failure. It went together surprisingly quick. It took longer to get the tent back into the bag than it did to set it up.
4,"Very compact, portable, but smaller than I expeccted","This is my first tent. It is very light & compact, the design is good but I wish it is longer.I assembled it in my living room this morning. I am 5'4"" & my head & toe touched the tent even without a pillow. So, I would agree with previous reviews: it is right size for children."
2,not a two person tent...,this is not a two person tent..least ways not two full grown adults . a waste of money unless you are shopping for a toy for a child. will not buy again.
1,Wish I could return these...,"These scoops were exactly what I have been looking for however, when they arrived they were heavily stickered on both sides of the scoop. Soaking and scrubbing did not remove the adhesive. I wish I could return them."
1,Small Scoops,The scoops are way too small and the stickers don't come off without scratching the plastic. Not good for sugar or flour.
5,the day the music died,i love this book i had to wated for about 6 weeks for it but it was thats ok cuz its one of the only books i found that talks about the big bopper. i have read about 4 buddy holley books and by far this is my fave
3,Not Much Ya Don't Already Know but a lot you didn't care to know,"It is an admirable effort, yet I didn't learn much that I wasn't already aware of about the artists or the accident. If you know nothing about the people involved then this would be a great book to start with, yet if you don't know then you probably aren't all that interested anyway."
2,BEAWARE! this is definely cut!,Well - i have this !What can one expect from caligula and it's rip offs1) ancient rome depicted - sets and screenplay in accordance with it2) public nudity and sexual depravity3) cruelty in consonance with historical aspect of the caligulaso it has all of theseSome rip offs have more of above- some have less !this print is NOT good even seems carppy transfer from vhs etcNow MOST importantly - the duration as given on amazon is 100 min whereas on the back cover of this DVD - it says 82 min.[approx]IMDb says it's 100 min uncut !So i am sure even this dvd is cut - it's NOT UNCUT !!!!!!!!!!!Anyone who knows where to get the uncut version - please leave comments
2,Caligula II,This was a realtively poor film which bore little relationship to the prime film 'Caligula' other than its name. The title 'Caligula II' is a misnomer.
5,Princess Of Ancient Mexico Review,"I just got this doll today. She's gorgeous! Plus Princess Of Mexico comes in a new box where you can open it without removing the doll from box. She looks like an Aztec woman and wears a beautiful jade-green dress with colorful patters at the hem, carries a beautiful, carved gold fan unlike many barbies, an awesome headress with pink and blue flowers. Awesome doll to collect! I have 47 barbies in my collection all in the box and I am fourteen year-old collector. Not twelve"
3,Part of my Collection,"Yea, I SUPER hate that they changed the boxes mid-way thru the collection I have a MAJOR gripe about that. I just ordered this and the Navajo POTW Barbie. She isn't my favorite in the series however (they say ""collect what you LOVE""), any collector knows you must have a complete set to up the value of a collection. When I first started collecting this series 4 years ago (was it 4 or 5 years?), I only had the intention of gettting the one's I really liked. I lamed out and didn't get the Inca's Barbie but had all the others, my wonderful sis recently paid 3X's the original price for her as a birthday present for me, and I now have all 19 dolls in the series. All the dolls in the series are beauitful and very well done (IMHO)."
2,Not impressed.,"Princess of Ancient Mexico is my least favorite of the line to date. I have plans to collect the whole POTW series so I will probably eventually end up with one, but I'm not particularly looking forward to it. PoAM's headdress is apparently too small for her head therefore is pressing in on her temples and almost in danger of poking her eyes out. As far as I can tell, this problem does not exist in the prototype version showcased on BarbieCollector.com. Anyway, I'll most likely wait for a clearance on this one."
4,High Chairs for Big Babies,"I purchased two of these high chairs for my twin grandsons' first birthday. They are already 30 lbs & have broken their other plastic based high chairs. I felt a need to buy cushions for the high chairs because they looked uncomfortable without something soft to sit on.I thought that since the twins were one, a conventional high chair would be quickly outgrown. Since these chairs promise to adjust through several growing stages, I thought it was a good investment. Amazon had the best price anywhere.I do not personally have to deal with the chairs, but I think it would be more convenient if the trays detatched like others I have seen or had a snap on plastic tray cover like some other wooden high chairs."
2,A little fact-checking would be nice...,"ANGEL WOULD NOT BE WEARING A CROSS.Aside from that, this is a pretty cool toy."
1,Pass on this one!,Warning: Invest your money elsewhere! I can sit back and appreciate amateur videos but this one is unbearable to watch. Babes Going Crazy is just someone holding a video camera without a zoom lense and violentely shaking it every few seconds on the beach. The cameraman is completely incompetant and misses a lot of potential footage...due to his own insecurities. Babes Going Crazy actually hurts the reputation of Mardi Gras and Spring Break by offering little variety. Who wants to see the same unattractive girls for 10 straight minutes? Most of the footage is either of women still in their swimsuits or guys who get in the way with their beer guts. The people who put this video together are completely and utterly clueless. This is the type of footage I would expect from my friend's bubble gum chewing younger sister.
4,This is Taucher classic,"I did not want to review this CD because it is old, out of date for trance fans. But after checking the review by VDI I thought I say something. The reason why I rate this CD high is because not only I am a DJ Taucher fan but also this CD was good when it was released in 1995. At that time Taucher's debut album was considered awesome. There were no Ferry Corsten s' or DJ Tiesto s' or other currently popular superstar DJs like today that could match up with Taucher's class. I know there is better, much better trance music out there today but this is still a Taucher classic. I'm sure fans have noticed the evolution of DJ Taucher's music style from 1995 till present. Taucher is still awesome."
2,Very Old Taucher,Im a big Taucher fan and I recently bought this album which is 14 years old or so hopping that it would be good or at least ok. I have to say I was disappointed and the music on the cd did not really age well. I have old Paul van Dyk cds from around the same time and his music aged better than Taucher's. Don't get me wrong the whole CD doesn't suck there is at least 3 maybe 4 good tracks in my opinion. If you are a fan like me you would get it just to have his albums but dont expect the whole thing or more than half to be good.
1,Defective item received from Always Bargain,"Damaged item, u can hear the inside moving, and a squeaky noise when on.I do not recommend this item not Always Bargain Seller, worst customerservice experience ever.Even 1 star is too much for this item and the company who charged me a restockingfee for a damaged item."
4,PEBBLES BATH BOOK,"This is a darling book and those who love Pebbles Flintstone will be completely charmed by the cute pictures of Pebbles. There are not many words but it is very interesting to the toddler set. Word of caution, though. Do NOT let your child take this in the bathtub if you want it to last. We did that and our book soon got ruined and had to be thrown away. Very enjoyable."
4,A great book for gauging your fitness level and health,"This book, sensitive to age and gender, perceptively breaks down fitness and health thorougly with topics ranging from nutrition and yoga to total body and mind care.With very colorful and intuitive charts the information is easily conveyed whether concerning weight charts, life progress or the respiratory system.Since published in 1998, I havent seen a more thorough fitness book. The simple and nonjudgement chapter on sexuality is especially nice. The section on preventing accidents and dealing with stress makes the book worth 2-3 times what it is sold retail for.The yoga poses, and stretches in general, are pictured a little inaccurately but that area is best serviced by a specific book, either Jean Couche's ""The Runner's Yoga Book"" or even Mehta's ""Yoga the Iyengar Way"",A must for every family and cherished by this single athlete."
2,Problems with hose !,I have had this hose for about a year. At first I was very happy with the Fuji spray equipment and hose. I think the Fuji sprayer I have is great. The problem is that the ferrule on the whip hose will cut a hole in the hose in a short time. It is not worth spending another $30 to get another replacement that will do the same thing. I would pass on this item .
1,Designed to fail,"While this whip hose is convenient to use, on the first day using it in warm weather, it repeatedly kinked, and eventually the ferrule at the end nearest the gun cut through the hose. For this price, do not consider it ""disposable"". Will look for another brand to replace it."
4,Fuji Parts.,"The whip hose, although it looks flimsy, has been a great addition making it easier to maneuver the gun in tight locations."
2,"Good concept, poor product",I've owned other Fuji equipment for many years and hold the company in high regard for quality. But this hose is inferior. Mine kinked and broke before I ever got to use it!Update - Fuji offered to send a replacement. They're a good company but unfortunately the hose is too prone to breaking.
3,Disappointment in this second release of Legend's of Ireland,"Having looked forward to this second release of Mattel's ""Legend of Ireland"" collection, I was so disappointed when I saw her. She looks cheap, her face is unappealing, her hair looks like she is preparing for dreadlocks, and her dress is horribly cheap looking. With so many shades of green to choose from, I am at a loss why Mattel would pick this dull color. A child might to like to play with it, but I simply can't imagine a collector wanting to display it."
5,The Best Recording I've Ever Heard,"I've listened to Handels's Messiah my entire life, so I'm very picky. I can honestly say this is the best recording I've ever heard."
1,Get a different recording!,"I'm not a connoisseur of Messiah recordings, but I have played in community orchestras, and so count myself as somewhat familiar with the music.I'm not much impressed by this recording, which must have been made in a large, empty hall. The sound, particularly of the orchestra, is soupy and unclear, and the chorus' phrasing unintelligible. The soloists are fine, except the baritone, who wallows terribly. Overall, a languorous performance I regret having bought."
5,Breathtaking,"Handel's Messiah rules, A must have! I listen to it frequently and it just keeps getting better."
3,Part good Part bad,"This performance of the 1742 oratorio sounds like it was written in 1872. It's big and features some leisurely tempos. Worthy Is the Lamb is given a rousing performance and the chorus and orchestra sound wonderful. The soprano,tenor and contralto soloists are among the best. Unfortunately the bass is not in their league. Ulrik Cold is proof that having a fascinating name does not guarantee vocal talent. If his name was Joe Smith would he have gotten this recording job? Doubtful. Seriously, he sounds like a well rehearsed amateur. So what you have here is an excellent modern performance that has four poorly performed bass arias."
5,Just what I ordered,"I love my cd's. I had the Messiah on cassette, now I will have them on cd's when Christmas comes again next year."
3,Disappointing,"The product arrived right away; however, the ad said that it would be professionally cleaned and polished - when I opened the CD, it was covered with oily fingerprints. Both DC's play just fine."
4,Wonderful Performance...Confusing Track Listing,"This is one of the best performances of the Messiah I have ever heard; however, the track listings on the reverse side of the case are inaccurate with songs 24 & 25 listed at the beginning of the second cd but are actually at the end of cd 1. Other songs are combined together on cd 2 contra the printed listing of the tracks. This makes it confusing to find a particular song but does not detract from the wonderful performance."
5,Excellent Interpretation,This recording has all of the vividness of the best performances. This is one of the best of the holiday classics. I enjoy it every year.
4,Beautiful,"We listen to ""The Messiah"" at Christmas and Easter every year. This DVD is great and we really enjoy it"
3,Some of the solos are disappointing.,There is a lot of debate over whether a huge choir and orchestra is better or what Handel used. I think Handel would have used a huge choir and orchestra if he could have. The choir is glorious in this CD but a few of the solos were not so good.
4,I am currently opposed to this website.,I find it completely ridiculous that there is evidently not an option to preview even one single recording of Handel's Messiah on this website. How in the world am I supposed to know which one I want to buy? A boycott is sounding like a good idea right now.
4,Great PRR history,"A very comprehensive history of the PRR in Indiana. The book not only gives a physical history of the PRR, but goes into the inside manipulations and business deals that made up the PRR system. There are a large number of vintage photographs that I had never seen of various locations of the PRR in Indiana. Overall a very entertaining and enlightening historical book."
2,Dissapointing,Either the people that praise the gore in this flick don't know what real gore is or I rented a cut version of this flick. I gave it two stars for originality and for atmosphere (Very spooky.) I was very dissatisfied with the make-shift ending and terribly dissapointed with the effects. Don't bother.
2,ericbarmore reviews,Subtitled in English.The movie starts off really slow and with it being in Japanese it just makes the movie slower.If you don't like Subtitled movies this is not for you.
3,and you thought leatherface had a dysfunctional family,if you like dark asian horror then this is for you this starts out with and ends with the darkness of the asian filmakersand the end is a shockerthink you know the woman who are putting the star in painyou dont
3,"Silly, but fun","I enjoyed Living Hell, but maybe not for the right reasons. There is some creepy camera work and editing, but real scares are compromised by a convoluted story and some not so intentional humor. Perhaps I was expecting too much after hearing comparisons to TCM. It turns out that there were a couple of shots directly lifted from Tobe Hooper's masterpiece and that, to me, is where the similarities end.Living hell proffers the same kind of entertainment as many of the better Honk Kong Category 3 films (minus the true crime). I did enjoy this movie; I just didn't think it was anything all that special, particularly when considering the richness of the quasi-genre, Japanese Horror, to which it belongs. However, it's definitely worth the rental if you are a low-budget horror fan like me."
3,Beware - not a pack of 6!,"I have used this fudge mix and love it, but it's hard to find locally. This was a great price (even with the too-high shipping cost) for 6 boxes...only when it arrived, there was only one and a note in the comments section of the receipt saying ""single unit only, not pack of 6""So it's a good product but check on what you are getting from the seller before you order."
5,perfect little melon baller,"This is just what I needed to ball melons, works well and has a nice handle."
4,Puzzled by a paradox,"I started reading Masterharper practically as soon as I took it out of the box. On the whole I thouroughly enjoyed it, but I could not reconcile my previous ""picture"" of Petiron as a sensitive and loving man who nurtured Menolly and approved of her compositions enough to send them to the Masterharper, and the insensitive jerk who was Robinton's father. I know towards the end of ""The Masterharper of Pern"" Petiron was mellowing somewhat, but he seems to have grown a new personality at Half Circle Sea Hold.All that aside, I truly enjoyed knowing Robinton as a child and young man. A must have for any Pernophile."
5,WOW!!!!,This book was ment to be a look at the man known as the Masterharper. It was that and more. I felt like I got to see into the past of an old friend. Ms. McCaffrey has out done herself once again.
4,GREAT INSIGHT INTO OWN OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE OF PERN.,THIS BOOK IS GREAT DESCRIBING WHO MASTERHAPER ROBINTON REALLY IS AND HOW HE BECOME A GREAT LEADER AND WHY HE WAS ABLE TO HELP SAVE HIS LOVELY PERN. ANNE McCAFFREY IS THE BEST WHEN IT COMES TO BEING ABLE TO PUT YOU IN HER BOOKS AS IF YOUR ON PERN AND LIVING THE LIFE OF A PERNESE. WHILE READING HER BOOK I CAME TO UNDERSTAND THE WORLD OF PERN SO MUCH BETTER. IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK YET AND YOU LOVE PERN AND DRAGONS YOU'LL LOVE THIS BOOK AND WANT TO ADD IT TO YOU'R COLLECTION. ANY QUESTIONS OR JUST WANT TO TALK TO ANOTHER ANN McCAFFERY FAN I WOULD BE MORE THEN HAPPY.
5,Harper of Pern,"If you are addicted, as I am, to the Harper Hall stories of McCaffrey, this is a wonderful addition. It is the story of the young life of Robinton, who is the Masterharper of Pern at the time that Menolly comes to Harper Hall and also the Masterharper that assists F'lar in Dragonflight. Well-written and full of music and dragons, it brings more depth to the problems Pern's Bendon Weyr and harpers encountered just before thread began to fall again, and also helps the reader understand Robinton better. And it's a great story. Highly recommended for any Pern fans."
5,One of her best Dragonriders books,"I've read this book countless times, and I still cry and laugh every single time. Robinton is beloved by all who know him on Pern and on Earth. Great book...I'll read it again!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This novel suffers from an overly long and padded first 20% or so, before you actually really get to the Masterharper himself, as a y oung boy, and could mostly have been dispensed with.The rest is more interesting, as snatches of Robinton's growing up and career are given, until his ascenscion to the top job.He's almost a bit too good to be true, except when seen dealing with the odd spy or other.McCaffrey as usual tends to gloss over anything remotely nasty to keep it kid friendly, but there's still plenty of charm to be found, and a it of realpolitik in dealing with the repressive and murderous Lord Holder."
4,a little confusing,"I thought this was one of her best books although it did seem kinda confusing because some of the things that she said in this book did clash with what she had said in the other books, it was a sad book because of SO MANY people dying but she didn't keep bringing up the subject and kept the story going by fast so you didn't dwell on that subject and get too sad. back to the subject of it being confusing,well it was I'll just leave it at that but she did explain some things like the close relationship between him and F'lar, also Camo, and sebell, but why was he so suprised when the dragons talked to him? it use to be his little secret that he could talk to dragons!! and how could Jora be weyrwoman SOOO long I mean she was for like four generations!! But over all it was a really good book, one of my faves! Buy it!! Read it!!"
2,Have we all been reading the same book?,"I was very disppointed in this book. I love the world McCaffrey created, as I love the character of Robinton, but I have to agree with the readers who found situations and characters repetitious from earlier books, who found Robinton just too good to be true, who were annoyed at the introduction of characters and plot points that were never followed up on. We all know McCaffrey can do better, and instead of praising her extravagantly and uncritically, we should encourage her to try just a little harder -- or get a better editor."
1,The Masterharper of Pern,I do actually enjoy Anne McCaffrey's work. But I feel that she must have been ashamed to bring out this book with so many plot inconsistancies.
3,interesting (for Pern addicts like myself) but no magic,"Like I said. In case you haven't had enough of Pern and it's many denizens (is it possible??) here's a look at the pre-""Dragonfligh"" life of Masterharper Robinton. Someone who previewed this before me wrote that they found Robinton too perfect. I agree completely. This guy leads a charmed life. A protege who everybody swarms to protect...still, you like him. I did, anyway. He's a very warm, fatherly figure, like a favorite college professor or something. Anyway, like I said, no Lessa, no F'lar, no Jaxom, few dragons = no magic. The coolest thing about this book was learning of F'lar's and F'nor's folks (it makes you want to read ""Dragonflight"" again, which is always fun)...and they're original names! Fallarnon and Famanoran?!?! For dear, utterly imperturbable, capable, stoic F'lar?? THAT was worth the price of the book!"
3,"Not for Pern Newbies, but Satisfying for the Dragon Lovers!","Anytime there is a retelling of information you've read in previous books, it might get a bit boring. For those who love the world of Pern, this just enriches the experience."
3,Regrets?,Anne is brilliant at the near miss. Many of her books have situations where things are about to fall into place and at the last minute everything goes wrong. Robinton's story compounds this. You KNOW what is going to happen. You can see an event coming and then......nothing. It's over. Very frustrating. I enjoyed the book and having read it I can see that Robinton was more valuable to Pern as a harper than a dragonrider but.... regrets again. In place the story was a little disjointed. A lot of emphasis put on a time span of a few hours then it changes to a lot of emphasis on a time span of years then scarce emphasis on a time span again. Good thing I was sitting down or I would have fallen over!
5,ONE OF THE BEST PERN BOOKS YET!!,"Amazingly written, this story goes into the details of Robinton and Petrion that I always wanted to know. I was already hooked on the Pern books, and this is just the latest in an amazing series of interesting novels.""To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under heaven""The lines stated at Robinton's death in ""All the Weyrs of Pern,"" the best novel in the series, END"
5,The book of lost tales,"The Masterharper of Pern tells us the ""Lost tales"" of Pern before the modern era when we meet Lessa. How Robinton knew and related to all the dragonriders. Explaines the attitudes of the Lord Holders who believed thread would no longer fall. Gives us a history of Fax. And because I especially enjoyed the stories of Menolly, I finally found out why Petiron was so reserved with respect to her talents. It gives great background to the original tales."
5,The best McCaffrey novel ever written!,"I loved this book. I couldn't put it down until the end of the story. I have always wanted to know what happened before Dragonflight, and this book does a really good job of telling you. There are several slight discrepancies, such as the name of the queen dragon before Nemorth (in Dragonflight it's listed as something totally different then how it appeared here), and several others, none of them detracting from the content of the story, however. There is one slight thing I'd like to know, and that is Robinton's exact age. My friends and I have contemplated this possibility, and come up with ages anywhere from 55 to 200. Somebody help us! At any rate, this book does a brilliant job of filling in the Masterharper's past. (I never knew he was married!) I loved this book and would recommend it highly to other McCaffrey fans."
5,Is this the last one in the series? I hope not!!,"This book is great, but is best enjoyed when you have read all of the ""Dragonriders of Pern"" series in order. Start today! I would love to read an adult version of Menolly's life, since the three books devoted to her are geared to juvenile readers...For lovers of this series, you can never get enough of Pern! Also, in particular, I really appreciate Ms. McCaffrey's incorporation of Irish names and Celtic lore/clothing styles into these stories...if you can get ahold of The Dragonlovers Guide to Pern(with Jody Lynn Nye), you will understand! Classic stories to be enjoyed over and over!"
5,What an ode to such a great man in Pernese history!,"After having been turned on to the Dragonriders of Pern saga during the Gulf war, I have waited anxiously for every one of Ms. McCaffrey's continuing stories of Pern. I must say that this book just continues my fascination with the whole saga. I understand so much more about Robinton than I ever thought I would. It opened my eyes to just how much this man wants the society of Pern to thrive and why he feels and does the things he does in later stories. I anxiously await the next wonderful story."
5,Robinton,The Master Harper of Pern is my favourite book in the world. The Kindle edition of it was almost as good as a paperback.
2,Just a decent biographry of Robinton,"The readers asked for it...that's why Anne McCaffrey wrote it, so she claims. I read it, hoping that she could make a good story about his youth. It is vaguely interesting but basically it was a dressed up from the background biographical material to the Pern books that Anne probably wrote decades ago. There was nothing exciting about Masterharper. No great adventure, new discovery or exciting action. We find out what formed Robinton's character and skills in his childhood and early youth. We also find out how he first met all the older personalities in the Dragonriders of Pern and trilogy established friendly or otherwise relationships with them. The best part of the book was the very end where it neatly lands us from a diffrent perspective at the beginning of Dragonflight: Ruatha, when Lessa is rescued by the dragonriders and Jaxom is born."
4,Required reading for Dragonrider fans (of course),"Any lover of the Pern novels probably has a fondness for the character of Robinton, having been an important character through most of the books. Pern addicts will enjoy the explanations of events and the tale of this characters childhood and rise to power. Without this love, however, the book is little more than average. It does have Anne's characteristicly lovable characters and her magical way of describing them without ever doing so. Die hard Pernests will love it, while dilitante fans may not."
3,i was shocked,"I really enjoyed Dragonsong - Dragon drums, they were pretty clean, but this one had too much... innaproprate stuff in it. I don't enjoy reading about sex. -the white dragon is really bad about that."
5,excellent work..............yet again,"as i have always wondered about the mysterious character of Robinton, this book was a must read for me. i was pleasantly surprised that while i expected it to be a ""fluff and filler"" book because it was done so quickly, it surprised me. it brought every emotion felt by the characters to the surface and i felt them, perhaps stronger that in some of the others. the story was crafted to give a birds eye view into the life of the largest character that has ever been in one of her novels a story behind his life and she accomplished that extremly well."
5,"Very, Very good! Anne McCaffrey is truly a talented writer!","Anne McCaffrey has truly shown off her talent once again in this extraordinary novel! Amazingly, she has made everything, every detail, every person, every dragon, coincide PERFECTLY with her other books.McCaffrey truly knows how to put emotion in ink, as many of her novels have left me crying or almost bouncing with joy. This one made me sad, sympathetic, and angry. I felt like cheering when Gifflen was sentenced to the Eastern Islands, but unfulfilled when his sentence could not be carried out as planned. But it was all explained later.When I read her first book, Dragonflight, it started in a dark, evil mood with Fax. The MasterHarper of Pern started out beautifully but sloped down into that dark, evil mood, which I feel was just perfect. It explained Petiron, Merelan, Silvina, Camo, Shonogar, Domick, etc. If anybody is considering buying this book, I highly advise it. This book should make no one feel dissapointed!"
2,Time compressed........,Why in the world would you want to buy this collection of edited/time compressed episodes. They totally violate my memories of the character. Rhino has normally had a reputation for issuing some of the finest TV programs. This is really below their standards. Don't waste your time or money on this one. I hope that ultimately someone wil issue all the Lone Ranger episodes in their original condition.
3,The Lone Stranger.,"Remembering as a child as I watched the many westerns of those times, how I loved the good guys beating the bad guys. Now, as time has gone by, I've learned the fantasies of the simple plots of those old stories. But as all things in life that I've also learned, fantasies, make believe stories (Star Wars! ?), their good for soul & mind. Just remember the realities of life, lurks out that front door!"
5,Great watch!!,"This is a very nice looking watch. Good quality for the price. It does have a rather large face, and is kind of heavy. So make sure you are used to wearing large watches. But, other than that, it was a great gift for my husband."
4,"Nice, elegant watch","This is a great, elegant watch. If you like big and heavy watches, I'll recommend this.I'll only suggest to Fossil that this model could look great in a more dark chrome. The product is silver color as advertised but the picture posted in the product's page, could make you think it's not."
4,I like!,This is one of Fossil's best. I love the black dial with the grey twist in it. The bracelet is very well done. Shiny polished links with brushed links. The coined edge bezel is great. It's a big watch and kinda heavy too. It wears like a 44mm. Great size. Check out the pics I posted for this watch.
3,My Poor Large Egg!,"This egg poacher works but, to my surprise and disappointment, it doesn't accomodate large eggs! The eggs cups are small and look to be sized for medium eggs. My large egg overflowed the cup and made a mess in the poaching pan. Too bad to lose a bunch of the egg white. Otherwise tho', the egg poached fine. I'll continue my search for the perfect egg poacher - one which perfectly poaches the large eggs I typically have on hand."
3,"Great coffee, but...","...how come Amazon stopped selling it under Amazon Prime? I once bought this regularly, but I won't if I have to pay shipping and wait for much longer than 2 days for delivery."
4,Sealant,It works. It met expectations. I got what I paid for. K & N always has top drawer performing products.
3,"Great book, poor design","We bought this book because it offered many pages of different ideas - ideal for a baby/toddler who likes to look at lots of different books in one sitting, it can be accomplished with this one book. However, the book is designed in a spiral notebook format with hard covers and the pages tear out VERY easily. I cannot let my 16 month-old look at this book on her own because every page would be torn out. It upsets her because I occasionally encourage her to look at her books by herself and she cannot have this particular book without my supervision.This book would be perfect if designed so the pages would tear (i.e., reinforced edges or traditionally-bound format)."
3,"Great idea, not so great materials.","This book is so wonderful in concept, though the flimsy paper pages did not hold up to repeated readings. The pages tore out very easily, and there was no way to reinsert them. Though a single board book for each day of an entire year wouldn't be practical (it'd be HUGE) maybe a board book for each month, so you could collect all twelve..."
2,Not Fun Activities and it Falls Apart!,"I bought this for my daughter thinking there would be actual activities. I was way wrong. There are 365 different things to look at and point out, but not any kind of games or learning activites (other then pointing to blue and red). Also, the pages are thin and it is spiral bound so my 19 month old has now destroyed about half the book. I would go for something else!"
4,Good Value for Baby Einstein DVD fans,"I got this book for my son when he was 18 month old. He is a big fan for Baby Einstein DVDs. He loved this book right away, since he recognized so many familiar characters in the book. This book has been a great educational tool for me to reinforce things he learned from the DVD. Actually, it helped me to learn a few foreign language words! The entire book is full of cartoons and pictures with vivid colors, and it is very pleasing to the eye. The only down side is the spiral-bound of the book. Several pages have been ripped out. I managed to cut out some cute pictures from the torn pages and made some flush cards. Overall, I would recommend this book, especially if your child enjoy the Baby Einstein DVDs."
2,Fun pictures...but spiral bound?,"I haven't bought this book and I'm still trying to decide if it's worth all the effort. This is a spiral bound book that can hardly keep the pages in place. I borrowed this book from the library, and granted it was in pretty bad shape when I got it, but by the time my 16 mos. old and I were ready to return it, the front cover had fallen/ripped off. I'm a book lover, so to me this was horrifying. But, I could never let my son read/look at it by himself just because it wouldn't stay in one piece. He loved looking at the pictures, but it's certainly a book that needs lots of supervision. Sadly, this book nothing you could hand to a child and let them play with without being concerned for the condition that the book is going to end up in. I can't figure out why the publishers thought a sprial bound book was the way to go. Hmph...I thought Baby Einstein was supposed to be ""kid friendly""."
4,Good book for together time...,"I would have given this book five stars, but only gave it four because it's not really an activity book in the way that I had thought. What I expected was different games, crafts, learning activites, but there aren't games or craft activities at all. It's a great learning tool and one that I enjoy going over with my 18 month old daughter. The other downside is it's spiral bound so it's not something I allow her to look at by herself because the pages can rip out very easily. Still, I have to give this book four stars because it teaches things like emotions, opposites, colors with all of the fun characters from Baby Einstein."
3,Lots of pockets.,"The HP Sports Backpack has plenty of pocket space for my laptop and accessories. The only problem I had with it was it's bulkiness. Other than that, it's a great bag. I always felt secure carrying my laptop in it."
5,Great Buy,"This ladle is great quality. My husband complained about all others and he truly likes this one. It is durable and is not flimsy like some we've had in the past. I would suggest it for anyone that enjoys soups, stews, or chili."
4,11 songs are cool and thats not bad,"When I found out this CD was being released in March, I got a job for a day just to buy it. I wasn't dissapointed, more like puzzled- I listened to Rancid doing Dont Call Me White, and I cant tell if he just couldnt reach the vocals he wanted or it was a joke. He sounds like Ernie from Sesame Street. Other than that, this CD is totally worth the time and money. The songs they picked are, for the most part, not mainstream and that was refreshing. I was expecting Punk in Drublic and And Out Come The Wolves, although I would have loved to hear what Rancid would do with Lori Meyers. My favorite was Vanilla Sex, all in all an awesome idea and CD!"
2,this bores me.,"rancid and nofx covering each others songs. With the exception of rancid's great rendition of ""bob"" nothing on here excites me in the least. eh."
5,Rancid and NOFX at their best,"I've been listining to punk for a while now, some of it good, some bad, but as I write this I'm listining to the album which has not come out of my cd player since i got it, and it will stay there for time to come. Rancids cover of ""Dont Call Me White"" stays in my head all day and i hear it in my sleep. Then I hear NOFX's cover of ""Olympia WA"", the song i only listin to occasionally when Rancid plays it sounds 100xs better coming from NOFX. Than NOFX does ""Radio"" with all its glory, I can go on about every song on the album, all of which are recorded perfectly. This is punk at its best. Buy it now."
4,rancid split,"First off I've always been more into Rancid than NoFX. This cd is cool though. Each band covers six of the other's songs. It's almost as if they're battling to see who could do it better.Rancid's renditions of ""Stickin in my Eye"" and ""Brews"" definitely did the songs justice. Tim's trademark slur is perfect on ""Bob"". Matt's vocals on ""Don't Call Me White"" crack me up. He sounds like he's going to eat someone!NoFX nailed ""I Am The One"". Jokingly slurring ""Olympia, WA"" keeps it entertaining. The reggae version of ""Radio"" admittedly took awhile to grow on me, but I love it now.All around good split; it's fun to hear two bands that really are friends impersonating each other. Worth adding to your collection if you're a fan of either, but not the most essential album in the history of either band.[ http://www.alt-echo.cjb.net ]"
4,don't trip,"none of the split series will be better than this,both of the bands did excellent covers,the only thing that set them out of perfection was the track selection......in my sincere opinion I'd would change some songs,just 2 or 3 don't worry,the perfect NOFX/Rancid split would be like this...Rancid1.- Kids of the K-Hole2.-Stickin' In My Eye3.-Bob4.-Liza and Louise5.-Linoleum6.-Vanilla SexNOFX7.-Roots Radicals8.-Olympia,Wa9.-Time Bomb10.-Antennas11.-Corazon De Oro12.-Radiobut any way is an awesome split.....buy it mija"
4,It's kinda like a battle of the bands . . .,". . . and you know going into it NOFX is gonna blow away the competition. In the realm of covers NOFX reigns supreme. Just listen to their cover of The Misfits' Last Carress and you'll know this to be true. The Rancid covers are a fun take on the NOFX classics. Hearing Bob slurred by Tim Armstrong is quite amusing yet refreshing to hear. The innovative bass riffs Rancid adds are a plus as well.Then comes the NOFX covers.Olympia, WA is one of the best cover songs I've ever heard. The little bit they added to this song picked it up and make it 10 times better. This song is now so good they opened with it live at the House Of Blues on March 7, 2002. Every song they cover is better than the original.NOFX wins this battle, easily."
2,"I love Rancid, but...","Rancid is my favorite band, but nofx ruined their songs. their covers of antenas and olympia werent too bad, but rancids are way better. Rancid however did a much better job of covering nofx's songs. Nofx changed the style way too much, it didnt seem right."
1,Never judge a book by its cover...,"This is a book that promises much and delivers very little. The ""steps"" that it offers to help IBS sufferers help themselves are few, vague and too general in many cases to be applicable. The medical terminology given in the first 2/3 of the book is interesting, but not especially helpful. The eye-catching charts scattered throughout the book are the only truly comprehensible features, and most of them are available on the book's web site. I returned the book, deeply disappointed."
2,The newer version is better.,"I had checked out from the library the newer version of this book (""Irritable Bowel Syndrome and the Mindbodyspirit Connection."") I thought this was what I was getting. The covers are the same. That book changed my life. It really helped my symptoms. This one, however, is pretty much the advice I've gotten from doctors for years (keep a diary, different drugs that help, blah, blah, blah). Don't get this book. Get the newer one. It really helps explain how emotions (known and unknown) create these symptoms and, more importantly, how to change it."
3,Good for info - Not for Relief,"I had great expectations for this book. Not too many books include a step by step program for a road to recovery. Unfortunately, despite the title, this book does not provide one either. It lists steps, but they are more informative than an actual road to recovery. So I was very disappointed. The book is, however, an excellent reference for someone who has recently been diagnosed with IBS or for family/friends of an individual with IBS that wants to get a better understanding of the disorder."
2,It was less than I expected,I found the book to provide readily available and common terminology related to the disease and little new information. I was hoping to find a book written from the patient's perspective on which treatment's work and daily living with this disease. The information throughout this book can be found in abundance just by looking on the internet.
3,psychological BS,I ordered this book with high hopes and was very disappointed. It was very 'deep' and psychlogical. It was hard to follow and really put me off. I was recently diagnosed with IBS and I got no help from this book.
3,Good for a year...,I recieved this product faster than expected and it worked great up until about a year after I purchased it and then the DVD compartment would not close. The amount it cost to repair it was almost the amount to just purchase another one. This time I decided to purchase from Best Buy.P.S. The camcorder itself provided clear picture and great zoom as I used it daily for business purposes.
3,Did Wal-Mart finance this?,"This movie is like one huge Wal-Mart commercial. Not all RV'ing seniors' lives revolve around Wal-Mart. Yes, Wall-Mart lets people park in their parking lots, but plenty of RV'ers rent a spot in the RV parks you can find in any city.I would have prefered a documentary about all retirees traveling in RVs, not one just about the percent of them you find in Wall-Mart parking lots."
2,The Truth About Demons,"When I first saw this movie, I thought it was a bit corney and unrealistic. The Demon ""followers"" looked like a bunch of freaks.Just a bunch of ravers gone wrong. But as the mystery began to unfold I was pulled in. I wasn't used to seeing Karl Urban in a role like this since I've only see him play tough guys. But He pulled it thru as always. I thought the film was ok. The storyline was lacking a bit and the ending was ambigous. The only thing that I found distasteful was the uncalled for sex scene. But hey it's a horror movie."
1,The Truth About This Stinkaroo,"Just imagine your run-off-the-mill, cliché-ridden Hollywood ""occult shocker"" (e.g. Lost Souls), but with thick Kiwi accents, abismal acting (some Marilyn Manson wannabes as members of a santanic cult particularly stand off) and a really, really, *really* low budget (piss-poor CGI and make-up effects included). What you get is this sorry crap of a movie. How this certified stinker supposedly became a ""cult sensation"" is really beyond me. Stay the hell away from demons *and* from brain-damaged horror nerds praising such utter dross. Jeez."
5,This is no Hollywood movie!!!,"...I wasn't much of a fan of Karl Urban's, my mother was, so when I got this movie for her, I saw it with her. Now I can say I'm a pretty big fan of Karl Urban's...I love strange and bizar movies, and this is one of'em!5 stars from me, I'd give it more if I could. And although it's great on vhs, I find the sound is a little more thrilling on dvd."
3,The Truth About Demons,I bought this movie because I think Karl Urban is a very good actor. He was excellent in the movie but the overall movie was not what I thought it would be. The sex scene was so uncalled for but the demons were pretty scary. The movie just moved way too fast for me. I give it three stars because I thought Karl Urban was very good in the movie. He helped the movie move along. I didn't understand half the movie though lol. Especially at the end when he and the crazy girl were at the mental ward. What was that all about lol?
1,"DO NOT BUY, THIS ITEM SHIPS DAMAGED",These mats come packed in a cardboard cover and a hangar handle. They are stapled together multiple times with large holes in the mats themselves. Yes they actually put industrial staples through the mats themselves. I returned the first set only to get another set with the exact same issue. I would strongly recommend against buying this product unless you want to receive defective merchandise and have to retun it a bunch of times.
5,"Wonderful for getting started, or restarted!","Short, punchy chapters teach you about prospecting, the selling process, getting on the customer's wavelength, dealing with objections, convincing strategies, people issues, closing, partnership selling, technology, career effectiveness, organizational effectiveness, and personal development. The author uses lots of bulleted/numbered lists which supply practical details on how to respond to particular common situations. This is clearly a book for the beginner, but it's another great book to add to your bookshelf!"
5,Start applying these tips immediately to your own business sales efforts,"This book has been more useful to me than the last half dozen sales books I've read. I appreciate that this author doesn't waste the reader's time with fluff and gimmicks. Instead the author gives clear ideas on how to cut through obstacles, get to the person you want to talk to and maximize the precious few moments when you can peak the prospect's interest or screw up the opportunity. Even if you're good at getting your foot in the door, checkout the section about reading body language and dealing with objections.Hope you found this useful."
2,Good...but not,"Well i recieved the controller in fast time. I opened it up and it worked amazing for my games. But, after about an hour of playtime, the controller joysticks are being funky and moving mycharacter in the wrong direction and are very shaky now. I am very angry that this happened."
4,Youuu lighhht up my life.,"Good golly, you could spotlight a deer with this thing !! And contrary to the website, you can't turn it off. But it's nothing a few dabs of black fingernail polish won't fix.(Don't ask) Feels good, responsive controls, turbo, long cord....no rumble...awwwww. Hey, 4 outta 5 ain't bad."
4,Worth the money,"This thing is pretty cool. It allows you to switch the motion sensing on/off for your liking, and the sensativity of it. It's smaller than the original controller and you might be an extention cord. It's worth the money. The analog sticks are a bit sticky at first"
3,Nice design but a little glitchy,"I like the design and the way it fits the hand, but there's a slight problem with the controller. Even without moving the directional stick it initiates slight movement on it's own."
2,Terrible,"The D-pad and Triggers are terrible, even for a PS2 controller. The 4 buttons and analog sticks are okay, but I've seen a lot better.I can't possibly see how anyone could give this a 5/5, I don't use the macro or other buttons so can't say anything about those.The design isn't great either..."
1,PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE!,"I am a professional musician that needs at times a reliable light for my music stand. This light failed on a gig after just three uses. I returned it to Ac-cetera at my expence ($5) and they sent me a replacement. I plugged in the replacement and it to does not work. Now I have to resend the product back to Ac-cetera, another ($5), who did not offer to pay shipping. ""UPDATE"" Amazon arranged for me to get a full refund from the company plus they credited me for the shipping. The light itself is made in the USA and is a very good product. It is the power supply, made in China, that is defective."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I got this set as a gift for a friend (and got myself one too so that we could try the games together). I wasn't expecting much, but WOW I was surprised. We tried EverQuest Evolutions first, and that was sub par, but then we jumped into EverQuest2 and the cost was justified within the first 5 minutes. We have yet to try the other games, but even if they aren't worth playing we found a part that made it a great purchase. My only complaint is that in order to use your free 30 days for each game you have to actually subscribe to play more. While you -can- cancel the subscription before any charges occur it is a rather large inconvenience, and it always makes me nervous to have to enter a credit card to receive something for free."
1,Won't install!,"I'm getting a vague error that's telling me to empty temp folder, check internet, close running programs (error: -6001). Tried everything, but still can't install. What a crappy packaging."
1,Maverick's ripoff of the STAR TREK TV series,"MAVERICK ENTERTAINMENT has really improved their special effects of late. Unfortunately, the rest of the parts of their ""films"" continue to be worse than what you see high school students produce. In this ""epic"", a crew of 7 (the unshaven captain, his ex-wife the doctor, a Sulu wannabee, his wannabee girl friend, Wolfman Jack the Klingon, some armed Klingon psycho who keeps shooting up the ship, and some bald white guy who only shows up on the ship when the other 6 are busy elsewhere) pilot a thousand foot long space ship on a trip to contact the living oil well that controls all life. After they do this, they have a cliff-hanger ending. Just so the audience gets what's going on, STAR TREK lettering is used for all of the credits. Obvioudly the start of a franchise.."
1,Do not waste your time or money on this movie,"I'm an SF fan and am willing to tolerate some bad acting or effects if there is a story or just ANYTHING in a movie that offers some imagination. I even enjoy movies that are so bad they're good. This movie introduced me to an unexpected and previously inconceivable experience. This is the first movie that I EVER considered turning off during the opening credits. The script and voice talent were that awful.But I watched the first 5 minutes of the movie anyway. No improvement. Did some fast forward. Turned it off after 10 minutes.Just ridiculous. Sometimes a movie is so bad that it is just so bad. So very, very bad.Your time is precious and when 10-60 minutes go by you never get them back. ANYTHING is better than filling 10-60 minutes of your life with this movie."
1,The movie that will live in infamy,"I rented this movie from RedBox using a code from McDonald. So I got to watch this movie for free. However, I still want my money back or at least the portion of my life which I wasted watching the first portion of this movie. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, period. The people who was a part of the making of this movie should be embarrassed of themselves, I am sure their mothers are. Do not watch this movie, not even if you are being paid for doing so. It's just so bad. I would rate it less than 'one star' if it was possible."
2,A really low budget Sci-Fi,OK for a view and some nice special effects but I think they were a bit short on money to have more people in it.
2,For hardcore gamers only,"Casual gamers need to take note that this is a VERY difficult game on any setting. I finish all the big FPS games on normal difficulty without any problems, but this one was sending me to the load screen CONSTANTLY on its easy setting. Your character spends most the game in a constant hail of bullets from enemies that are mere specks on the horizon. Anonymous, unpredictable death is very common as the hitpoints for the player are extremely low (relative to other games) even though he's supposed to be wearing body armor. If you're not a gaming ninja with unlimited time to spend honing your FPS skills, you may be in for a frustrating experience."
1,Could not download,"I was so disappointed in this item, I had bought this for my boyfriend, he was so excited but we could not download it on his computer."
3,Great til you get so far,"The game is really cool until you get to these things that have cannons on their arms, then everything gets impossibly hard."
5,bling bling what's this,This game is aviesly a show stopper. Very many people have been waiting for a game like this. And I was waiting for half-life 2 but when I tried far cry out at my friends house I just had to get it. If you like very realistic and sniping games your gonna wanna take a good look at this. The only problem with it is you gotta have a pretty good computer to play.
3,Carefull when you buy this one..,"I must say it is a great game, if you can get it to play. This game is very particular about what CD player it wants to play in. I could not ever get it to play on my Dell 4550 because the game didn't like either of my CD players. It installed and played with no problem on my wifes little Emachine...Go figure..."
5,Outstanding PC Game,FAR Cry PC Game is one of the best PC fps Games I have played till date. The CD rom product quality was acceptable and graphics were ok. Probably a DVD original would be better.
1,Like Blowing My Nose On A Fifty Dollar Bill,"I heard a lot of good things about this game. Bought itand the video is so corrupted I can't play it. Went round andround with Ubisoft who sent me a lot of boilerplate ""help"" like""update your video card driver"" and ""download the latest patch"".Thank you Captain Obvious!! I have wasted hours trying to solvethis problem. From checking out Far Cry sites, the littlesecret seems to be be this game won't run on certain hardware/software combos. I'm running an AMD 64/3500+ 0n an A8V Mobo w/a Gigabyte X800Xt Vid card. Why do Half Life2, MOH PacificAssault, BF1942, etc work great and not FC??? The customerservice is utterly useless. Software guys say it's a hardwareprob and vice versa. NOBODY should have to work this hard to geta game to run. I gave up finally and I can't get my money back.Buyer Beware! Ubi will never get another nickel from me!!!!!!!!"
2,Far Cry,A good game with lots of problems...see tweak guides for solutions. Iinstalled the game on my computor.... got pumped up for the first play period and was blown away by the introduction and beautiful graphics. Then the problems begain. How do I save the game? How do I restart the game at the computors save points without starting a new game ever time? How do I turn off the intro so I don't have to listen to it at every start up? I have now played the game for more then ten days and I give up! Its a great game but if I can't save yesterdays play and always have to begin the game anew each day then I don't want to play. Its like reading a book from the front page over and over again trying to get to the end in one read and if you stop playing before the end you have to do it all over again. The tweakers guide has a fix it for many of these problems over 175 pages of fixit.But I just want to play the game I don't want to build one.
2,On-Line Game is Terrible!!,"Being an avid on-line gamer ever since Unreal Tournament, I was happy to see a game try to be a little different. Playing against the computer is fun, but the REAL action happens on-line. However, this is Far Cry's weak point! I have a top of the line system, with a cable modem (3.4 meg download/upload) and the games continually lagged -- ALL the players complained as you jittered your way around the maps, ""trying"" to shoot someone. This became extremely annoying after awhile. The selection of on-line servers is also pitiful! It looks as if the Far Cry folks didn't place much effort on the on-line option of this game. I have since gone back to UT2004 (Unreal Tournament 2004) which gives you many more options, servers, and dependable on-line play."
3,"Good, Almost Great","Far Cry is good. It is fun. It is almost great. Why? My biggest gripe with the game is a lack of a save feature. You save at ""save points"" automatically. You cannot resave at the same points, so they are more of time line saves. I have no idea why this game does not have a save feature.Another small gripe is the lack of a ""to-do"" or mission list. A few times I had gone away from the game for a week, came back and forgot entirely what I needed to do next.The game is nice looking. Not the best, mind you, but I am sure this engine has a long future ahead of it, with this game being but the start. The game play is fun, the enemies are challenging and the story is ok (nothing fantastic, no Deus Ex). The engine is nice enough that this may be the next half-life.One more ding: the voice acting really stinks."
1,Lame Overhyped Junk,"If you want a shooter game where you have to unload an entire 30 round clip into an opponent in order to maybe score 1 kill, then buy this game. You can sneak up on other players and shoot them point blank over and over again and not even draw blood, let alone kill them. Tedious and boring. What a huge disapointment this game was. Well, at least I still have CounterStrike and UrbanTerror."
2,SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW,Horrendously slow shipping. Unacceptable!Amazon has dropped the ball again...
2,A disappointment,"This game is a disappointment. All I heard from people was, ""good Reviews, good Reviews, good Reviews!!!!!!!!"" But I have no good Reviews for this game.Great graphics, in fact..... AWESOME GRAPHICS, but still the weopons are unrealisic!!!!! The P90 has a 5.7mm bullet , ARMOR PIECING(realisic)!!!!!!But it still takes 15 to 20 shots to kill someone!!!!!(unrealisic)The armor on this game is way to strong!!!!!!P.S. Plus, there are no AK 103's!!!!!!!!"
1,Quality control ?,"I downloaded the demo and it crashed 3 Times within the 25 odd minute demonstratoin I subjected myself to. I have played ""Splinter cell"" and ""Raven shield"" and they also quite often crashed on my computer (Both UBI games). My system is Windows XP SP1, P4 1,6 GHz, GF4 Ti4600, SB Live PCI, 512 Mb RAM. -Note: Very standard components with the latest drivers as well. Granted, not the 'latest and greatest' hardware, but still plenty good enough for 'today's' games @ reasonable settings. I have played and still play UT2004 and many other games with no crashes, so know it is not a defective system causing the problem. Moreover, regarding Raven shield, I contacted the UBI ""tech support"" via telephone (as it is very obscure how to e-mail them from the information provided on their website) and the gentlman with whom I spoke was very rude to me."
3,Like Paris Hilton - Beautiful but waaaayy too hard to win,"The best looking first person shooter to date, but by the middle of the game I went to a cheat site which I NEVER doand went into god mode just to see what kept killing me. After I became invincible the game became no fun. Needs a quick save, takes forever to reload scenes and then you have to do them AGAIN to get to where you will surely die just like last time."
3,Gorgeous but TOO FRACKIN' DIFFICULT!!!,"Even three years after it's release, it's still the best looking game i've ever seen.I'm playing it again this month, and it starts out easy enough, but is now getting RIDICULOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE.If you get it, play it on EASY mode, with AI balance ON. Otherwise, thou art screwt!"
2,AI not as good as promised,"PLEASE NOTE: This is from the Demo, not the full version of the game.Myself and a number of friends downloaded this game. We all came to the same conclusions independent of each other (7 people - 2 game designers, 2 avid players, 3 average players)1. you need a high end machine to run the game, but it is worth it.2. Maps and scenery and ambiance. Wonderful well done.3. The AI was total crap. Predictable, non-responsive, and generally reminded us of much older games. It's easy to find spots the AI is blind to. They also snap back to patterns. You can have a firefight just a little bit away from the island, and they ignore it (less then 150m or so). You can drop a badguy in some ways so the others ignore his death, even walking over the body. We found some other AI predictabilities, which got worse as the game progressed. You just find the patterns, pick off the badguys, and move on.It was heartbreaking that such a pretty game had such bad gameplay."
3,Hope it gets better!,"I was looking forward to playing the demo of Farcry immensely, the videos and screen shots I'd seen on the internet looked very impressive, however the demo basically shows the game off in a bad light for the following reasons;1. On my system a properly configured, 2.8Ghz P4, 512MB RAM, FX5600 Ultra it ran like a dog.2. The much vaunted AI is unrealistic; mercs won't hear your speed boat engine but will hear you disturb a leaf. They will see you in thick undergrowth but will run right past you in plain view?3. It looks and plays like an arcade game, it has not of the class or tension of Splinter Cell or Call Of Duty.4. The graphics are pretty in a far off flight-sim sort of way but close up textures are no better than games of previous generations.If the finished game is like the demo I doubt I'd purchase it."
3,good game but,"I have a win 7 computer, and had to send the game back, the game would not load.You have to find the one with the 5 cd's for win 7."
4,Ubisoft - a definite contender,"I have 2 ubisoft games and both are superior games - great graphics and cool plots... plus I really enjoy 1st person shooter - and I don't need to go online and have a 12 year old annhiliate me... I have a family and don't have endless days to figure out a game.. I like to go in and shoot some bad guys as fast as I can... without having to read a novel, go through endless videos, or practice my movement skills for a year before I am any good.. don't get me wrong... play on the advanced levels without cheat codes and you will probably die a horrible cyber-death in a quick fashion... but the game is fun and it was a great buy... I highly recomend this game!!!!"
4,Great gaming experience,"It's a great game featuring an awesome engine, The single player campaign is really good, and the multiplayer is ok, totally recomended."
4,Still the most real and fun combo,"Utterly realistic, yet in an extremely fun and approachable way, Far Cry rewrote the book on the limitations of shooters, and gave players more freedom then has since been provided..One of the key elements of keeping players trying again and again after they continualy die was demonstrated beautifuly with the freedom based, a.i. enhanced gameplay.."
5,awesome game,"This is one of the best PC shooter games to come out in a long time. It is a long game and can be quite difficult even at the ""normal"" level. The graphics, sound and action are great. It also is more that just a shooter since some strategy is needed to defeat the enemies at various levels, especially the more difficult ones. Be warned: The violence is quite graphic.The system requirements for this game are a little intimidating. I was afraid that it wouldn't run well on my system but the setup options are quite flexible so it is possible to get good results on low end systems. I have a 1.3 Mhz P4 with only 256 Mb of RAM and a 128 Mb ATI video card. I let the game set the video and sound options and it ran fine. However when I tried to set the video options for a more detailed display I ran into problems.If you like FPS games with a little strategy, great graphics and a lot of action this is the game for you."
5,Excellent DX9 Game,"I will preface this review by saying this game is cutting-edge, and therefore you probably need a solid DX9 card to enjoy it fully. To the reviewer with a 5200 FX, the problem isn't the game, it is your video card.For those of you with a broadband connection, download the demo and see for yourself (though the demo doesn't do the full game justice). Incredible graphics. Great gameplay. Plenty of weapons. Few software or compatibility problems for me. Sufficient game length and decent replay value (just because it's so fun). Mulitplayer seems fairly solid, but the single player is the reason to buy.Highly recommend for the gaming enthusiast with a solid video card. For those with older or cheaper cards, I would try the demo first. Great FPS. Highly recommended."
4,short p/review,"i played the demo, it was K; graphics are amazoning, ai is pretty sly, ragdoll physics is fun, and the vehicles are pretty cool. The one thing that will ruing the game if they don't fix is the saving game function; its horrible, i mean i walk up the hill get all these sweet guns, I want the save my game... but how? i goto menu no save game function, i goto controls to see if quicksave is there... nope. after about an hour of being frustrated i started to play some more, it automatically saves the game, but doesn't let me save. I happend to get extremely freaking angry about this when i got up the mountain/hill thing, and an enemy was run infront of me shooting at me. I had 14 health, and no ammo. I die, save game reloads, i die, etc. If this is not fixed in the final, the single player portion will literally be destroyed.I'm thinking maybe it wass a feature just not included in the demo... but why would they not include something like that."
3,war game,fast delivery very pleased. My husband was not pleased with the game but he will try it again. He stated it was different in alot of areas that he was not use to playing.....
5,real looking,the game plays well. thr graphics are unbeliable. they are so real that you wish you were there.fun to walk around and enjoy the scenery.
3,BEWARE TIME STRAPPED PARENTS - CHECKPOINT SAVES,"I bought this to blow off steam and, you know, kill a bunch of bad guys on the computer. HOWEVER, this is a checkpoint save game. Cannot play, cannot save when my son wakes up, totally worthless.It is obviously a good game, but there is an entire demographic (time-crunched parents) that considers it worthless."
3,Would not PLAY!,"I just could not get this game to run on my computer.I tried all the tech support and patches. it was very disappointing. However, I ended up borrowing a copy from a friend and it is a pretty awesome game! I have almost completed it and ready to start over and play it again.Bottom line: I have always trusted Amazon and always receive outstanding service! It wasn't Amazon's fault the install CD was defective. I have had trouble with other UBI games."
4,Great Game,"This game has great AI and graphics but the storyline is quite bad.I read a lot of reviews that this game is to hard and that you need a very fast comp. but all that is (...).All the guys who think this game is hard must be totally crap because my 8 year old sister can finish most of the levels.I can run this game on Low AA,High Enviorement,High Detail,Med Water,Low Shadows,Low Special Effects and all the other settings on medium on a average machine(P4 2.8,1 gig Ram,Radeon 9200SE)with constantly 30fps.I really enjoyed this game"
1,not fair to review an item before it comes out...,"but i feel this deserves a little more on the page besides the title.its a first person shooter founded on technology from a company called crytek. it belongs on the list with doom 3 and half-life 2 in terms of quality and enjoyment/gameplay.the things that make it stand out from the other two games though, are the AI, level structure, and definitely plot.This game boasts AI from the start. theres mutliple ways to go through a level, so the AI was made to be smarter right from the start. even if you dont see them, theyre working, they get bored. they chat to each other.the levels are massive. the game mostly takes place on a certain island. but if you see another island in the distance, you can swim to it. there is no linearity to the design. and the plot is not your standard, aliens/demons are taking over (although doom 3 is at the top of my list).i definitely think this game deserves a look at."
1,Worse game EVER!!!,"I can't believe I paid money for this. This is the only game I intend to throw away once I pass it. I'm only still playing it because I'm trying to get my money's worth. First, thegraphics are not the best quality and yes, I do have a current video card with all of its uodates. Whenever I shoot someone in the far distance I get blood pixelating before my eyes blocking my view. The game freezes every few minutes. I can't adjust the sound so I have to turn up my speaksers just to hear the gun shots and the voice overs are drowned out by the background noises. What little dialogue I've heard was horrible voice overs. The story is stupid. I'm a professional story-teller so I'm picky about good quality stories. I can't wait to get this game over with. This game wasn't worth the gas money I spent to buy it."
1,Boring,Don't waste your money. If you played Half-Life or Doom this game is soooo boring.Thanky you for reading.
1,It is a tedious game that made me sick,"Tediously long and weary. Nothing interesting, just a lot of borrowed ideas from RTCW, HL2, etc. I am sick of this."
4,Great Stuff. Can't wait for the sequel. 4 1/2 stars,"I've dabbled in simulation games over the years, and never quite loved them. There's always something that sorta makes me lose interest. FarCry is the first one that I've spent money on in years that I haven't yet timed out in.Yes, you have to go back and play the same dagnammit scene over and over again sometimes when you don't quite get to the built in checkpoints, and yes, the monsters are not really necessary, but other than those minor quibbles, this is a totally engrossing way to waste otherwise valuable time in ones life.THere are always things that could use improvement in everything in life and FarCry is no exception. Letting the player set checkpoints would be great, and less bugs and crashes would be helpful too. But in reality, I thoroughly enjoy this game and would recommend it."
5,"Lots of fun, and very non-linear","This game is great because 1) the monsters scare the poop out of me, 2) there are multiple ways to clear the levels, and 3) the long-range visibility makes it more fun.I just installed this game on a brand-new Dell and have had zero problems.Each level seems to be set up so you can advance using stealth techniques. There are little things set up to create distractions, etc. Of course I play by killing every living thing but I am not creative either. I'm starting to add stealth to my ""skills"" and this game lets you try different approaches to solving problems. You can go in guns blazing, you can sneak in, or you can use the great visibility along with cover/concealment to pick off the opposition as they attack you piecemeal. Fun!"
5,So much fun,"I absolutely love this game. This game ranks up there with Half-Life2, Doom3, and World of Warcraft for me. Its just great. Most of the games today are trying to make them dark and really scary and blah blah. This game is intense, but its not retarded. Its all damn fun. I find my heart goin real fast when I know im coming to a good part. this game is just damn good. i suggest you buy it ASAP.pros -great graphicsgood gameplaynot too hard, not too easygood physicswell madecons -some minor glitchesa couple annoying ass levelsi suggest you get it if you like FPS'. great game, one of the best."
4,"Excellent graphics, excellent game play. Highly recommend","I didn't know what this game was when I first got it, but I installed it out of curiosity (it had RAVE reviews). After several hours of ""tip-toeing through it and getting killed over and over again, before FINALLY finding ""THE SOLUTION"" to each problem, I was hooked!WOW! This game was well-thought out.My ONLY complaint is that the game is so tough (< not a bad thing), that I finally (after a week of frustration), had to find and download some CHEATS just to make the game PLAYABLE. But WARNING: The CHEATS only make it marginally ""more playable."""
2,Checkpoint save BLOWS!!!,I agree with the previous reviewer on this point. It completely ruined the experience for me...there's no excuse for not allowing you to save when and where you want.
5,Excellent game,"I find it hard to believe that as good as this game is, it got almost no hype or pub. The game play, artificial intelligence, and graphics are top notch. The stages are enormous and challenging, with a nice mix of enemies -- all of which are extremely intelligent and reactive. With the exception of Half Life 2, the best game ever, this game blows every game out of the water. You must play this game!!"
4,"Myst, Riven, and Duke Nukem all in one","I would have given this game five stars if the gameplay were a little more like a real first person shooter rather than a sci-fi shooter. Yes you go after people, but after a few levels it gets like the Isle of Dr Moreau. Great graphics, and you could lose yourself in the expansive terrain. The AI is really good too, although they are really predictable, no they don't just sit there or drop down to crouch when they hear shots, and they do use the cover given, but they just zig zag and make stupid comments like I'm going to shoot your face. Also you need a really high system to run this, mine is a 2.66 P4 with 512 RAM and a 128mb video card and I can only run it at high setting at 1024X768 to play it fluidly. Really good game though I think"
1,Torture!,"The game allows for no way to SAVE the game!?!Too bad, seems like it would be a fun game. But, with no reasonable access to cheater codes (I downloaded the game through Steam and nothing I've tried works) and no way to SAVE the game, the end result is WAY too frustrating for me. It's possible to wander around in the world of the game for a LONG time without it saving. And when you die, you go right back to where you started. To me, that's not fun, that's torture!Obviously, as the other reviews make clear, this is a well crafted game. In fact, it's probably a great game and deserving of four or five stars. But I'll never know because I'll never play this game again.I'm not your typical gamer. I'm not very good at it and I don't want to work that hard. So you probably shouldn't listen to me. But, if you ARE like me, be forwarned. Not being allowed to save your progress as you move through the game is simply a fatal flaw.Anyway, that's my 2 cents."
3,Good Game,Great fun to play. I really wish the sequel didn't throw away so many of this games mechanics.
3,Not Bad,"Pretty much the same type of game as Halo - similar weapons and uses, game controls, animations. I guess I'm spoiled because it's still not as good as Halo and I ended up just going back to playing Halo one more time. The game controls (driving the jeep, flying the ships ...) are better on Halo, the enemies more interesting, the plots more engaging.This isn't a bad game though and has more variety and slightly better graphics than Halo. If you're just tired of playing one more Halo campaign, this is a reasonable alternative."
2,WARNING - will install starforce malware on your computer,"the game is fun and the price is great. but installing drivers on the users computer is poor judgement by ubisoft. i cannot return it as it has been opened. there is nothing in the EULA to warn of this. this DRM-crudware is all the reason i need to never purchase from ubisoft again. which is sad, because the game itself is alright. these sort of practices should not be tolerated by consumers. be upfront with your consumers ubisoft!"
3,Dissapointed,The fondant was the consistency of almost dried out play dough (too dry)! I was disappointed to say the least.
2,Too Pricey,"I bought the product and the colours are beautiful and it arrived speedily, but boy are the packets small! Ok so the weight checks out. I just somehow imagined it to be a bit bigger. It's a bit pricey and I would think twice before purchasing it again."
1,YUCK!,"This fondant tastes horrible! It has this really bitter after taste but before that after taste, it tastes like nothing... YUCK! I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Nasty!,I tasted some of this this evening for the first time and I would be really embarrased if I made a cake with this stuff on it because it tastes NASTY. I am going to make my own if I ever decided to decorate a cake with fondant. I really think I like icing better. Why put something on a cake that doesn't taste good?
1,Make Your Own,"I ordered this to make a Lego Ninja cake for my sons birthday. I wanted the bright read and yellow colors to really pop. First off it taste awful not at all what I expected. Secondly it is hard to roll and drys out very quickly. Third when trying to use a paint brush with a little water to smooth the edges on my lego blocks the color in the dye ran all over. Last but not least This kit is designed to make shapes and such to put on a cake not nearly enough of any one color to cover and entire cake. This week I am off to my my older son an xbox cake and I will certainly just be using the marshmallow fondant recipe I found on the internet it's what I ended up using on the Lego cake and it easy to make, taste amazing and the color doesn't run."
4,Very lengthening. Only gets a little clumpy after a month or two.,My mom introduced me and my sisters to this marcara. And now we are all hooked.I'm an esthetician and I wish they had a waterproof version (the only reason it's 4 stars) since waterproof mascaras are damaging to remove. I have a pretty decent makeup remover but it still takes a little too much effort to get completely off.Despite that it totally lengthens your lashes and seems to help with their growth as well! Great product!
2,Stage Magic not Psychic Book,Caution - This book describes stage magic tricks to fake spirit contact and is a debunking book also. This is not clear in the title at all nor mentioned by my seller.
4,New meets old,Really good stuff.You get your traditional asian music entwined with a modern twist. Nicely done and not too over the top.
5,Interesting,"I had the chance to see the first Theatrical Production of this play, done at a local theater here in Northern California. It was wonderful, and the book is the same. I especially liked the aunt!"
4,Works as advertised. A good unit!,"As the description says: ""Compact, durable and user-friendly""... that about sums it up. I can't really imagine paying the same amount for basically a plastic (or wooden) box that requires extra work to keep things stirred up. Just fill it and spin it, if it loaded itself it would be perfect! The ""tea"" catcher is also a big perk in my book.About the only thing I would like would be to have it a little bigger (not everyone would need that though...)"
5,Envirocycle,This is a very efficient and effective composter. It's easy to fill it and tumble the contents. I love not adding to the landfills and have enjoyed seeing the 'fruits' of my composting labor returned to earth on my veggie garden this year. Excellent 'green' machine.
5,Couldn't be easier.,"What a great composter. I roll it every few days and when it's done, roll it off the stand to wherever it's needed. No shovelling deep down into a barrel. This one does all the work. As my neighbor grunts and groans and has to deal with a wheelbarrow, I just roll along."
4,We love it - quality product!,"We received our Envirocylcle composter as a gift a year ago, and I am now purchasing a second one (to fill while the first batch is finishing cooking). The bin is easy to use and rotate - a little harder when the bin is full (but that's to be expected.) The compost tea catcher is marvelous - an added bonus for my plants. It appears to be animal resistant. Our bin is in our backyard which borders the woods, and we have had no problems. (The only reason I did not give it five stars is because of the latch. I agree with previous reviewers - the latch is flimsy and plastic and I do worry about it breaking.) When the compost is done, we just roll the barrel to where we want to put the dirt and unload it. This composter makes composting easy."
1,not worth it,"I have had one for 4 years now and I am currently looking for a different system . Main issues are:The door is too small and flimsy . It is unpractical to add garden compost through such a small opening or take anything out.The load doesn't rotate easily when it is 2/3 full. There is no grip or handle , and more than once the bin got away from its base and I ended running after a tumbling compost bin till the end of my garden. Bringing it back to its base was more exercise than I would look for even at the gym !"
2,not recommended,"this composter came in a box with absolutely no paperwork or instructions. I contacted the seller about this and received no reply.it is huge, somewhat unsightly, propably not good for beginners, and emitted quite an odor."
2,"Decent coverage, wretched writing...","I've been required to read this book for a college class and I'm writing this review to help myself get through it (I'm in the middle) as a way of venting. The writing is annoying. Moreover, consequently, at the same time, nonetheless, although, however, then again, also, furthermore -- every other sentence seems to begin with a transitional phrase of some sort, as if the author's thinking process and perspective actually rely on juxtapositions and introductory clauses. Aside from being annoying, it forces multi-dimensional subjects into a 2-dimensional on-the-one-hand-and-then-on-the-other-hand way of thinking. The information is interesting here and there, but it's hard to get into when you can't get past what sounds so much like someone pretending to be educated and limiting the quality of his thoughts to the parameters of boring language habits."
2,Not Much There,"A reader's impression of a book is often closely tied her expectations. In my case, I picked up Gorgon thinking that it would be a paleontological discussion focused on the mass extinction at the end of the Permian period - this is not the case. While the brief comments that Ward offers in this regard are not uninteresting they could be covered in a short article.Unfortunately, from my perspective, the bulk of the text consists of personal recollections and reminisces. These types of books are not my cup of coffee - like family photo albums their appeal is normally limited to those involved. I do not doubt that these memories are important for Ward. I do not think, however, many readers will find Gorgon to be worth the money or effort."
4,Can reading about extinction be enjoyable? Yes it can!,"Peter Ward writes with such enthusiasm that it is easy to be carried away on his adventures. While I wish he would have spend more time explaining life before the Permian extinction and the theories of that catastrophe, most of the book was dedicated to his quest for the answers. He focuses on the laborious excavations in South Africa, tensions between various scientists, professional jealousy and the political climate and changes in South Africa. After reading this, you will have a good idea about the extensive research that field scientists do and the various dangers they face, including bandits, weather, difficult terrain and inadequate rental cars."
2,Dull,Very light on paleontology. Reads more like a personal diary than a book about science. Disappointing over all with very little about Gorgons--the subject of the book.
3,Process-Oriented,"This is a pretty good book about an interesting topic, although I found that the book spent less time talking about the lost prehistoric world, its inhabitants, and how the extinction came about than I expected. Rather, the book mainly focuses on:1) the people involved in ferreting out the historical mystery;2) describing the kind of work that the scientists did (think lots of digging and scraping in remote South African locations);3) the personal relationships (and tensions) between the various team members; and4) the author's editorial comments about South Africa and its society.I was disappointed that the book focussed on the process rather than the resulting scientific conclusions, but overall it is a pretty interesting book nonetheless. People more interested than I am in the four topics listed above should find it interesting indeed. And if you are thinking about becoming a paleontologist, you should definitely read this book!TMR"
4,Amazing detective story,"This wonderful book reads like a detective ""who-dunnit"" story, including some unsuspected plot twists and a surprising conclusion. The ""crime"" is the mass extinction at the end of the Permian age, and the detective is a geologist searching a hostile African desert for clues.This book weaves science with emotion, describing both the research as well as the lives and adventures of scientists dedicated to solving the mystery of what happened to a world that existed before the dinosaurs, some 250 million years ago.A bit more could have been included on the animals of the late Permian, and some sketches of what they looked like when alive would have been helpful. Nevertheless, one of the best books on palaeontology and science I have ever read."
2,Well written but just an autobiography,"Ward loses a momentous scientific theory under a book about his personal trivia and self-involvement. Managed to get in quite a few snarky comments about people he's supposed to be best friends with, too.I didn't learn anything and the Gorgon in the title was barely in the story."
4,"GORGON, the process.","Nothing that I have read immerses you more vividly in the gritty process of sample collection and processing, and the need to go out again to redo what you completely finished at least twice before. The author does not have to say a word about the prospect of someone pursuing quick fame wanting to rework your hard-fought samples from academic offices. Finding GORGON itself was led to by a related venture running into on the spot obstacles. Later GORGON is found to be not quite GORGON. Peter Ward includes a brief statement of his newest theory that some body types evolved in low-oxygen in which the problem of respiration dominates."
3,Probably not what you expect from Di'Anno,"Love Iron Maiden and am a big fan of Paul DIanno but this ""new"" release is a rip off. All it actually is is the 2000 release ""Nomad"" with a different running order and a few Maiden covers thrown in. I was one of five people who bought the ""Nomad"" album when it was released and was personally a little disapointed. There is definitely some quality material here but Paul's reach exceded his grasp in places and I feel he strays too far from the classic melodic metal style that he became famous for 25 years ago. If you are looking for Paul's best post Maiden work try and find the Killer's album ""Murder One"". All that being said, while I enjoyed the running order better this way than when these songs appeared on ""Nomad"" shame on whoever decided to promote this as a new album."
2,Not Recommended for suspended flooring,"From my view this product is primarily for new construction and for a slab floor.If you have a suspended floor you will find this product more trouble to mount than products specifically designed for suspended flooring.Note I have no problem with the product itself, other than I think the product description should state that its not for suspended flooring.The AMAZON supplier gave fast service, had good packing, and was very easy to deal with on my returned order."
5,Great in concrete,"Relatively expensive, but it served the purpose of in floor recepticals for an addition to our home. Easy to use, with multiple sized ports for conduit."
3,Obscure Songs,"The only reason I bought this CD was for the song ""Love You More,"" which I love but have trouble finding on a compilation. I don't like the rest of Sunscreem's music so I don't want to buy the album, and I finally found this CD containing the great song. I had also heard ""Two Princes,"" but the rest of these songs were unfamiliar to me. Some of them were good but not many."
4,2 reasons to buy this album,"There are only two reasons I bought this album. One is Prince Markie Dee and Mad Cobra. I can't believe I found these songs on an album together. Overall, this cd is a good bargain but the best is mentioned above."
3,no choice but this book..but got a lot from it!,"TC7 as well known to us UP los banos studs. Iam not as good as others are in math, iam a civil eng. student and using this book for my math courses was sure the book of choice! why? because it is self-explanatory and so concise that i could skip classes and just read at my apartment. and pass the quiz the next day. (but that wasnt advisable)all i can say, if u are patient enough to read this book you'll get through calculus just as easy as it can be......"
5,I loved this game!,"The story line was great with purpose, meaning and heart; the graphics were beautiful; wage earning was interesting and different; and the music, ambiance and voice acting were all very well done. The interface was easy and cool. I thoroughly enjoyed sneeking around the world of Hillys and her moon. Ah, those Alpha Sections were too funny with their dialog and actions when under attack. And the cut scenes were sweet with action and drama. Please, please, please, Michel Ancel make a squel! And Ubisoft, please be smart enough to support it!!!"
4,Needs A Sequel!,"Just in case any Ubisoft people are reading this, THIS GAME NEEDS A SEQUEL! It has beautiful graphics and wonderful gameplay. Admittedly, I ran into a couple bugs, but I didn't mind starting over too much because it was such a great game. It had a cliff-hanger ending, too, so I get the feeling that there was supposed to be a sequel. People, buy this game. Maybe they'll realize that what the world needs is a Beyond Good And Evil 2!"
3,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A NIVADIA VIDEO CARD,"DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A NIVADIA VIDEO CARDseriously, it wont work with the latest drivers.the game is a poor port too, buy it for a console instead if you can"
1,Terrible game,"This game is not fun--it's frustrating. It's difficult to maneuver the main character and the graphics are very poor. If I could get my money back on this one, I'd would. Don't waste yours."
3,It's okay,"You play as Jade, a pretty young woman who is a reporter.The game is essentially a 13-year old's mystery game. It has some puzzle-solving moments scattered throughout the story, but nothing mind-wracking. Fighting and violence are treated as terrors, with some hints as to its effects on people. Ultimately you pierce the web of lies and find out who was causing all the trouble, culminating in a final battle with the real villain.Overall, I enjoyed it, but it's short, probably 10-15 hours at best. There's no replay value since you can't control more than what you purchase, for example. A sequel would be nice."
3,Charming but unfinished,"Nice plot, but the development of the characters seemed flat. Perhaps there was not enough subtlety in the characters. Although there was drama, it seemed staged, unnatural?"
5,For use on campus,"Jeremy Gimbel, and the staff at the Youth Division of the Union for Reform Judaism were right on the ball with their editing skills. This Bencher should be used by all Reform Jewish college groups, it is progressive and modern, while remaining liturgically the same (minus the gender neutrality and the progressive changes.)Buy this Bencher."
2,Another slice of life,"I bought this based on my favorite works by Max Schulman, including ""Love Is a Fallacy"", ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,"" and ""Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys."" It turned out to be a disappointment. It takes place toward the end of WW-II and is about a young Army Air Corps sergeant going home to Minnesota for furlough. There is no real story, and about one-third of the way through, I got to wondering where the author was going with all this. It begins with the main character traveling on a train and going from there to arriving at his parents' place and looking up an old girlfriend and a few buddies. He meets some interesting people, all of them with humorous names. That's about it. Being a series of events without a plot, it resembles ""Homecoming, A Christmas Story."" In other words, a slice of life. After two-thirds, I gave up, figuring he was going nowhere with a plot."
1,Does Not Work,"We have tried - and failed - to use this product. First, WHEN you can get it to work, the volume would fill a medium sized class room, but never a lecture hall or auditorium. It simply does not have the guts. Finally, the system will only function when the notebook PC (Dell) is unplugged from the AC power. As soon as the PC AC adapter is plugged in you get a very loud buzzing noise that we cannot find a way to make disappear. We are disappointed."
1,Horrible CDR re-issue,Buyer beware. I received this order and it looks worse than a bootleg. It is a cheaply burned CDR with a green back and glue residue on the inner hub. The print quality is so small and blurred that it cannot even be read. This is even worse than one of this disc on demand cd's. A CDR loses it's play quality quickly and I would never knowingly pay money for one.
5,Thank you Ester-C!,"What can you say about Vitamin C? This is supposed to be the best form for maximum absorption, and lots of other supplements (like iron, ladies) are better absorbed in the presence of Vitamin C, so I try to remember to take it every day!"
2,There are Better Choices Out There,I found this product to be flimsy and difficult to use. The screw part will wind off if your not careful. I think your money would be better spent on a more beefed up version of this product. I will have to purchase something else. This one just doesn't work for me.
3,adequate for occasional use,"When I bought this I liked wing-style corkscrews, and wanted one with a built-in bottle opener. It's surprising how many wing-style corkscrews these days don't have bottle openers. Unfortunately the corkscrew functionality itself is not all that great on this device. It works, but the screw doesn't go smoothly into the cork. Great for somewhat who only needs a corkscrew once in a while, I suppose. I have since replaced mine with a waiter-style corkscrew, which works better (for me) and takes up less drawer space."
4,"Easy to use, but after YEARS of use, it does finally break...","We have had this item for over 12 years. If you get the screw all the way into the cork before trying to lower the handles (to easily lift it out), you will get the cork out every time. (Your patience is rewarded.)However, after 12 years of use, the screw-top itself actually twisted right off. Not bad for an item under $8. We quickly purchased a waiter's corkscrew and realized quickly we wanted the ease of the Pedrini instead."
3,Nothing special.,"This is one of those things I shouldn't have bought - it's not a box grater (too fine), not a microplane (too coarse), and ended up in the very back of the kitchen drawer."
1,Junk,"First of all this is really only good to grate the very hardest of cheeses into fine dust. The surface is better suited to hard spice grinding (ex. nutmeg). I'm actually not sure how well it would handle the task considering the handle separated from the grating surface the first time I used it; granted it can be shoved back together and used with caution.I just examined the picture of the ""Pedrini Black & Satin Steele Cheese Grater"" that I have been asked to review and upon closer inspection see that it is not the same exact grater that they sent me. The holes on the one in the picture look like those of a ""fine"" slot cheese grater and would probably work fine, that is if the handle stays on. Perhaps I am the only one who received the wrong one.... Let's hope so. I picked up something exactly like the ""RSVP Endurance Cheese Graters, Set of 2"" at Whole foods (probably the same product packaged up w/ WF label"" and they work perfectly well for a myriad of tasks and are very sturdy."
3,holes are too fine,"love the way it holds, and the curved surface. but i find it grates too fine. i use it for cheese."
4,"Excellent, concise commentary in a great series","The Holman New Testament Commentary series is an excellent set of bible commentaries and Kenneth Gangel's volumne on the book of John is one of its shining jewels. Here is a commentary on John which is aimed a serious students of scripture, Sunday school teachers, group study leaders and Pastors. It is not overly scholarly, a trait which makes many of the respected commentaries on John overly ponderous and difficult of use. I own and have read the John commentaries by Carson, Morris, Baker and Kostenberger but this volumne by Gangel is the one I always come back to when I'm studying the book of John."
2,American Monster,"In his preface, the author quotes his wife as saying, ""Don't ramble-get to the point."" Semonin never takes her advice and thus this is a book that should have been no more than half as long as this disjointed collection of digressions. There are really several stories in this book. I wish the author had decided which one he wanted to tell. Semonin can be an engaging storyteller and the discovery of fossil mastodon bones in North America came at a formative stage in American history. Too bad the author didn't find an editor who was willing to make him take his wife's advice."
2,Ugh.,"Looks cute, but once on the foot it is uncomfortable. I felt very unsteady as the heel kind of wobbles when you walk, and the shoe slips back and forth on my foot."
2,Assault and Pepper,"the last couple of the books in this series have been disappointing. Seems Magdalena spends more time talking to yourself than others, if she is SO UGLY how does she have the ""babester"" the earlier books in this series were much better, my favorite I think was the SPAM one. They were enjoyable, things were centered around the Inn. It is also like she owns the town only because she is a millionaire and she flaunts it. Magdalena has become VERY annoying!!!Annette"
3,Assault and Pepper,"The first books in this series are better . . . I liked the series but I have not followed Magdalena since the birth of Little Jacob, tho."
2,"Nice Japanese songs, but don't be misled","Despite what the title of this album may say, this is not a ""soundtrack"" to the StarBlazers (English title) animation series which remains so popular. Instead, this is a ""song collection"" of Japanese songs inspired by the series. Perhaps only the initial song -- the theme to StarBlazers in its true Japanese format -- is readily recognizable. I took a chance buying this album, hoping for a real soundtrack, and was a little dissapointed. The songs themselves are nice, but not, I think, worth the import price."
3,Disciples II is better,"My bottom line is that if you want a more engaging and more appealing turn-based fantasy strategy game, go for Disciples II. The only draw-back of Disciples is that there are only five races (human, undead, demon, dwarves, and elves). Warlords have more.My biggest gripe about Warlords IV is the animation and the graphic; it's really bad. I suggest you download both demo of Warlords and Disciples and compare the artwork and gameplay. Another problem is that there are no real resource management... no gold to mine and no mana to collect. Also, each race has only 6 units! The human race has the swordman, bowman, knight, siege engine, archon, and a hero. In comparison, the human race in Disciples has almost 20 different battle units, ranging from assassins to white wizards.Some of the drawbacks of turn-based strategy are evident in Warlords, but the negatives outlined above didn't impress me. If the price is low, I guess then it isn't a big concern."
1,1/2 the game of Warlords 3,"I've been playing Warlords since the original game came out. I actually still play the original every once in awhile. Every new version of the game improved on the concept with the exception of Warlords 4.This is about 1/2 the game it should be. There are so many things missing, most notably diplomacy, that simply ruin this game. I honestly believe they ran out of money to make the game.Warlords and Heroes of Might and Magic are my favorite series of all time. I love these types of games. This game is so bad however, that I actually deleted this game, threw it away and went back to playing Warlords 3 which is a significantly better game.The only good thing about this game is that when I went to the website to see when they would release the unfinished half of the game many of the posters were talking about a game called Dominions 2. I ordered it and have been playing it almost non stop for 3 months."
2,This radio ends up being average,"I thought I was getting something quite different than a typical A M Radio. No improvement in reception and when it was turned on to a station, this radio was no better than a RCA at $29. Wished it was better,"
2,WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN,After 5 years speaker went bad.Two friends that had the cc radio a yearor two before I did both lost thier display panels after about 3-4 years.For the price should have lasted much longer.I still have a GE super radio 20years old and works fine.
3,CC Radio Plus AM Reception,"We purchased a CC Radio Plus about 6 months ago. Unfortunately, we did not return it. I am not at all happy with the radio. A radio this costly should at least have signal seek. The station tuning buttons make a lot of noise (not good if you are listening on earphones to not disturb your bedmate) and are not very responsive. I have three Sony Dream Machine radios, and in our mountain area with difficult reception, the Sonys (1/5 th Size of CC Radio)have AM reception every bit as good as the CC; when the stations get weak, they get weak on CC and Sony. The blasted CC plus display light is a nuisance, always wanting to come on when you turn the radio on."
2,Rip off,"This radio is advertised as one of the best around. I fell for the hype and I want to warn you that it is full of flaws. 1) reception was no better than my small Sony radios. 2) The sound is supposedly balanced for talk radio. To me, it sounds muffled (as if everyone is talking out of a cave) with few highs. Yuck. 3) There is no handle, just a grab indentation. A radio this big is sure to drop with nothing to hold onto. Yes, they do sell a carry case - one that makes the whole thing as ugly as can be. 4) The buttons have to be pushed down hard to change. An individual defect on the one I got? Who knows? 5) This is very expensive for a whole lot of nothing. Don't be taken in. Get a Grundig field radio or a Sony instead. I regret my purchase."
2,Not happy with the CC radio Plus,"I have to agree with the fellow from Atlanta! The CC Radio plus doesn't sound all that great for the money you pay, and the AM sensitivity to me is no better than the GE super radiosthat cost three times cheaper. Sony radios do a much betterjob dealing with night time fade. the FM reception isnothing to brag about either. I think the weather radioshould have SAME encoding for the money you pay forit."
2,NOT WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE,I BOUGHT THE CRANE RADIO HOPING TO PICK UP AM STATIONS ABOUT 250 MILES FROM WHERE I LIVE. I ALSO BOUGHT THE EXPENSIVE ATTENNA WITH MY RADIO AND NEITHER PRODUCT WORKS AS ADVERTISED. THE RADIO SEEMS TO BE WELL MADE AND THE SOUND IS GOOD. BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A RADIO TO PULL IN LONG RANGE AM STATIONS THIS RADIO IS NOT IT!
3,Sound/Reception - Good; Craftsmanship - Poor,"Although the sound quality is good, the overall quality of the radio suffers. I have had mine for a few years now and none of the buttons work well anymore. I have to hit the power button many times to turn the radio off."
1,ABSOLUTE WORST RELIABILITY,"ABSOLUTE WORST RELIABILITYI've owned my CC radio for a number of years. Over time every single button has found a way to malfunction. The channel buttons don't change channels but they do change the memory setting so press enough of the buttons and they all end up set on the same frequency. Sometimes pressing a channel select button turns on the alarm.As I turn the large channel select on the side it goes up a couple of channels then goes back to where I started over and over and over again.The on/off button only works sometimes or not at all. It's quite a frustration trying to find the right spot on the button to turn it off. Then there's the night light button, which like the on/off button may or may not work.I called C Crane and Company, explained the problems and lack of reliability and was told for a stiff fee I could return my radio and wait eight weeks to get it back."
5,Peaceful and Relaxing Instrumental Christmas Music,"This set is so wonderful. No words, just gentle Christmas music - quite a variety,and wonderful background music for the office and at home during holiday gatherings."
5,Wonderful!,"I absolutely love this perfume! I can't even begin to describe how it actually smells in person, except to say that it is a unique and beautiful scent. I think this perfume is a breath of fresh air in comparison to all of the other overpowering scents out there."
5,Extremely Classy Fragrance!,I bought this fragrance after reading the book The Perfect Scent by Chandler Burr. It is so wonderful and elegant. A real education in what a quality fragrance should smell like in all its stages. Buy it you will not be disappointed. Read the book to learn more about perfumes. a great read!
5,Sublime!!,"I got this perfume after reading a lot of reviews, and did a lot of research. It was a present for a very special friend, with exquisite taste, so I wanted to get something unusual, classy, sexy. She loves it!!!!!!"
2,Good if you already know Lakota,"I bought both CDs Level One and Level Two. It starts and goes completely through with a guy just talking in Lakota. Even on CD Level One...there is NO ENGLISH at all, an nothing to look at or refer to. I was really hoping to learn Lakota, but justlistening to a foreign language with nothing to LEARN the language from, is nearly impossible."
4,Great series... Bad picks for DVD,"I own one of the ""recalled"" DVD's, I got it at Popular Chain video store... I guess they weren't supposed to sell it. The previous descriptions of the episodes are correct. I just wished that picked better episodes then these. For example they should have picked ""The 1977,"" ""The Food Inspector,"" ""Bad Shrimp,"" or even ""The Spelling Be"" shows (ect., to vast to list). What I do like is the interview with director DAVID MIRKIN (Thanks Rhino!), the animated menus, crew/cast filmographies, and the No laugh track option. I won't bad mouth the shows they picked too bad because bad shows are better than no shows. Hopefully we can get the whole series and maybe see an interview with Chris himself. Keep Up The Good Work Rhino!!!!"
4,Let's Have All Episodes!,"""Get a Life!"" is one of the great cult comedies of the 90s. I wish Fox or Rhino would release ALL episodes in a box set. There are only about 34 episodes altogether, so it could easily be done. As it is, we are getting a SNACK when we need a MEAL."
4,Five simple words...,"I'm giving this DVD 4 stars simply for lack of extras. There's a short interview with David Mirkin, but not much else. They could have at least included a few words from the man himself! Maybe Rhino's saving that for the next round, if there is one.But Get a Life is a five star sitcom, and I am more than happy with this DVD. I have been waiting years for a good copy of ""Zoo Animals..."", possibly the funniest 30min in television history. The other episodes are good as well, though there are some I would have rather seen than ""The Big City"". ""Meatlocker 2000"" anyone?Anyway, it's better than any VHS bootleg you'll ever find.So buy this DVD...Missy!"
2,"Get A Better Transfer, Rhino","This volume of ""Get A Life"", the hilarious early 1990's sitcom starring Chris Elliot as a 30+ year old paperboy still living with his parents, has some great episodes on it but unfortunately they are presented in what has to be one of the worst transfers I've ever seen on a DVD. Rhino Video should be ashamed for putting together such a shoddy piece of work. The images are cloudy and pixelated to such an extent that it's hard to make out any detail on some things. I've seen better digital video on the internet. Of course this doesn't cause the show to be any less funny than it is but it does make you wish that Rhino had taken a little bit of time and care to clean these shows up. The first ""Get A Life"" volume is of much better quality than this one. Buy only if you're a real fan of the show. Actually you might be better off just renting or purchasing the VHS version of the show if there is one. I expected better Rhino."
4,Hilarious!,"For anyone that thinks an alien that constantly spews different colored vomit is not funny, go back to watching Friends or something as highly uncreative. I'll still be treasuring this wonderfully warped show, longing for the days when TV shows could be creative orignal, even- DARE I SAY IT?- unique?"
4,too little,Was a very enjoyable show. The shame is that only four episodes are available on DVD/VHS. The one about the extraterrestrial is very funny.
5,brilliant,"There has never been a show as funny as Get a Life. It's intelligent, engaging, and borders on performance art; we are fortunate the program made it to the airwaves. Please Rhino, get the rest of the shows on DVD or video."
5,Incredibly hilarious!!,"I have been waiting patiently for someone to finally release episodes of this outrageously funny series. if only more were currently available, particularly episodes from the first season. This show was too cool and original to last for long. When are more to be released?"
5,YES!,Thank you! Finally someone realized what a great show this is and released it....now where are the rest!?
2,Not a strong sample of Get a Life,"Despite being on the air for only two seasons, Get a Life had a number of quirky, hilarious episodes. Unfortunately, these second-year installments are not two of them. The humor of ""Spewy and Me"" starts and ends with its premise--E.T., but with a hideous, malevolent alien--and may be Chris Elliott's creative low-point. ""Girlfriend 2000"" is better, but still below average when compared to the show's first-season offerings. Get a Life lost some key characters, and a lot of steam, in its sophomore campaign. Rhino video should recognize this fact and issue the classics, like when Chris and his dad get trapped inside a toy submarine (""Neptune 2000"") or when Chris gets married and divorced in the same day (""Married""). Otherwise, this series of video releases may go the way of the television series."
5,POSSIBLY THE BEST SHOW OF ALL TIME.,"If you actually don't find this show funny, you should be shot. This is easily one of the most original and most hilarious shows EVER!"
5,WOW! This is Rock and Roll!,"This album is the closest Squad Five-O has come to capturing the energy of their live show. Every track is solid. It is worth buying this CD just for ""I Don't Want to Change the World, I Just Want to Change Your Mind"", ""Underground Hearts"", and ""Wasted (With You)"". I honestly don't know what could have been improved on this album. If you are a fan of The Rolling Stones, D Generation, or the Ramones buy this album!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Kalakala's Story is a part of Seattle,"No Dream Is Too Big is a wonderful story for children about the Kalakala. It is written as a heart-felt, historical tribute by its author, Judith Ennes. I am impressed with its beautifully colored illustrations by Kathy Wilburn that children will definitely admire as they learn about the Kalakala. This book is great for teachers and children as they explore the history of the Kalakala. Judith Ennes presents the Kalakala as a long-time, hometown, historical part of Seattle. The local community and its children should enjoy and appreciate this well-written, illustrated book. The sentimental portrayal of the Kalakala is refreshing and makes this book pleasurable for the young and the old. I recommend this book for those who appreciate the sense of community in Seattle. Historical stories about the Kalakala and Seattle itself should be shared with residents of our community. Judith Ennes does an excellent job of portraying the Kalakala's story by writing this book."
5,Well-written and entertaining,"Kalakala Comes Home is a children's story abut the ferry Kalakala returning to Seattle from Alaska. The author researched it extensively, and the boat's history is sprinkled throughout the book. In addition to having colorful illustrations, it is well written and entertaining."
5,A Ferry with a Heart,"The lovable ferry triumphs in this engaging story of how her dream comes true. The story is true, and the author's inventive approach leaves you wanting to meet Kalakala in person. In recent weeks, the real Kalakala returned to Seattle from Kodiak, Alaska. As Ennes tells us, she'd been rusting and sinking into numbness there until one man decided to take things in his own hands. Where can I get a Kalakala t-shirt!"
4,NAME CONNECTION,"I must say at this time I am very excited about reading this book.My married name is KALAKALO and I was searching for information on this name when I came across this book.I live in Canada and know nothing about the family name.This is the closest I have come to anything similiar.My father-in-law was adopted by Mr.Kalakalo,and he continued to carry this name as his family name.Is there any chance that somehow there could be a connection to the book,""KALAKALA COMES HOME"".Please e-mail me I am in need of any information on the family name,since I have two sons,who also carry this name. Kalco@hotmail.com Thank-you"
5,the perfect cymbal !!,"perfect product ist loud strong, wide range, excellent finnish it doesn't stain like other cymabals when do you touch it..10000% recomended."
1,This was a bad title for this album,"Ok seriously this album is bad. Very bad. DO NOT LET THE NAME FOOL YOU! I listened to the album and it all sounds the same and not to mention terrible. Maybe their other albums were good I dunno yet but skip this one. This group is a mediocre Massive Attack and Radiohead basically. However this is my opinion if you want to take a listen to these guys but if you end up loving it great thats your opinion but if you hate it remember, you were warned. I also hear they are from my home town...it sickens me."
1,"Poor, heavily-edited DVD is a joke, see it uncut PLEASE!","My low score is due mainly to the atrocious DVD release, not the film itself. Why does this DVD bite? Let me count the ways...1.) Not widescreen2.) Edited to pieces! The original was much more gory and had several HARDCORE ... scenes.3.) Poor picture and sound.The film itself isn't a classic by any means, but this release makes matters worse. Try to get a hold of an uncut version (available from many cult video dealers) and judge the film that way. Even the amazing Laura Gemser couldn't save this mess of a DVD, but I gave it one star just because she's in it. :)"
1,0 Stars - WARNING !!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"After 2 months, the firewire component of this product short-circuited and fried all connected firewire components including the firewire port on my CPU motherboard. D-link will not accept liability for any damage caused by this malfunction. This hub acted as a conduit for $2500 damage to my computer system. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"
1,It didn't work!,I bought this USB hub for my new XP Media Center PC and my system was having problem recognizing my logitech webcam when it's connected via this hub. I have an existing Belkin USB HUB so I tried to connect that HUB to my new media center PC and my webcam is working fine. I am not sure what is the issue but I figure it's best to return this D-Link DFB-H7 since it does not seem to be versatile.
1,Look for a different product,"I had this product for a little over a week and had nothing but problems. Devices that attach and install fine on other USB hubs would not work. The firewire ports worked for a very brief period, then stopped working altogether. The best thing about this product was that I could return it."
4,Internationally Challenged but Sometimes Moot,"Power adapter is a US friendly 110 volts only. Can't use the power adapter in many countries. Although in every case, the hub works unpowered. I'm sure this is a very system dependent result, YMMV.Disappointed that I can't plug in a high-power-hungry USB device (DVICO USB HDTV receiver) into the hub because WinXP reports ""usb power exceeded"" and disables the hub's USB port. This happens even when the hub is powered and happens in every USB slot even if the device is the only USB device in the hub. Must continue to use a notebook's USB port for this device. For my notebook, a Dell E1505, it doesn't seem like powering the hub has any benefit. Perhaps the Dell puts out a maximum current to the hub eliminating the need for powering? Guess I don't need an international voltage adapter after all."
4,Mileage always varies: works great for me,"Reviews on items like this are always mixed. Nobody's system is exactly the same and things might not work for one system while they work flawlessly on someone else's. Most products in this price range could arguably be called ""disposable"". I sympathize with the reviewer who had his whole system fried, but the device has been solid for me. I'm buying another. I too, have deducted one star for the marketing: ports used to ""connect"" to the system should not be counted; only the number of expansion ports.Evaluate your needs; evaluate the risks as extolled by other reviewers, and make your choice well informed of the risks and experiences of the others. Good luck."
3,a new love,It used to be that I couldn't put this book down. It was on point and insightful and really helped me start my business. But that was before a friend handed me Guerrilla PR Wired by Michael Levine. It was brilliant and current and the methods were spot on. Theories such as the Magoo Theory helped me to really zone in on why certain techniques work and why others don't. I couldn't go back to Guerrilla Marketing Excellence after that.
5,REVIEW QUOTES,"Margaret Randall presents a dynamic collection of 14 personal interviews with Nicaragua's most important writer-revolutionaries who played major roles in the 1979 revolution and the subsequent reconstruction. These artists speak of their writing and their pratical tasks in constructing a new society. Among the writers included are Gioconda Belli, Tomás Borge, Omar Cabezas, Ernesto Cardenal, Vidaluz Menéses, Julio Valle-Castillo, and Daisy Zamora.""This is a book that encourages and empowers those of us who are poets, those of us who write and those of us who work to change society to fit the hopes and dreams of the common people."" --Alice Walker""..the truthfulness as they tell their lives...as literary workers in a revolutionary time...the happiness, the toll, the sacrifice that's part of the process. And...the pride of being heard, your next poem waited for-your trade 'poet' respected and emulated by the young."" --Grace Paley"
1,This Book Needs Improvement,"I am currently enrolled with the IB Program, taking HL Chemistry. Although this book does guide us through what the syllabus for the Ib is, it definitely needs improvement. It is not a bible, as one hopes it to be. It doesn't cover half of the syllabus, and if one studies from this book for an IB Exam the person can do nothing better than a 2 or 3."
2,Could be clearer,"It is very comprehensive but not spaced out enough. The whole book is really one thick mesh of text with not enough order too it. I use an A-Level book to help me with unclear stuff and together with the revision book they make a good combination.The upside is that if you are looking for a good grade you really have to sit down and ruminate until it all becomes clear. After doing that you remember it better, but still, it really has room for improvement."
1,Sleeping Chem-pill,"I suppose all IB textbooks are roughly as boring as each other.Look at the Glanville on for Economics, it's kinda the same type.OK! Let's go on with this Chem one. I did made me sleep one night while I was trying to revise........ So, if you can't sleep, simply just read it!"
4,Great replacement belt..,"ordered this for my 94 ford bronco 5.8 liter v8 and works as advertised. No more bird (chirping) under my hood from my old worn out belt that this replaced. Can't really rate it much different than that, its a rubber belt that fit perfectly fine for the application."
2,FootSmart Arch Huggers,"I used them for about a week and they felt really good so I wore them nearly all of the time. But after week one, the stitching on one of the arch huggers was already tearing away. I am pretty disappointed with the quality."
1,DON'T BUY THESE!,"I bought these for my daughter. They were comfortable. The small was not too tight but supportive. Unfortunately, before the end of the day, the seam ripped and only a few threads held it together. I contacted Footsmart who wouldn't refund my money. I won't buy these again and I won't order from Footsmart who wouldn't do anything about a defective product."
2,"Nice, If They'd Stay Together","These do not actually raise the arch but they do offer soothing compression for sore arches, that is for the short time that they last. Like other reviewers, I had the same problem with the seams coming apart. Too bad, they were nice to sleep in."
3,It's OK but there are better solutions,I have fairly flat feet and this product didn't give me the support I was hoping for.
2,dont stay in place,Would not recommend buying these. These dont stay in place very well. They keep slipping toward my toes when I wear them.
5,The Beethoven Sonatas and the Creative Experience,"As an amateur pianist, Professor Drake's book is proving to be a useful adjunct to my understanding, enjoyment and performance of Beethoven's monumental compositions.James L. Franklin, M.D."
4,children's book re: Tourette's,"I found this book to be pretty good about describing a boy's experience with Tourrette's and how he deals with telling his friend, and other kids. It's better than some others I've read, but not as clear and helpful as Tic Talk, by Dylan Peters."
5,My Daughter related to this book,"My six year old daughter has had tourette's for nearly three years and I have never been able to find a book written on a child's level that is honest and realistic. In addition, she identified with the physical and verbal tics in the story. I appreciate how the author mentions several of the ways tics occur and the reactions of people in their world. My daughter is now practicing telling others ""I can't stop, my brain's making me do this"""
5,Inclusive Overview,"This book is perfect for introducing TS to anyone new to the diagnosis. It normalizes the typical experiences which precede and follow the diagnosis. I have used it for peer education in a classroom setting, as well as for individual youngsters (& their families)."
4,I like it!,"First wallet I received separated at one of the seams (cloth interior) so I'm not going to give it a 5. Ebags handled it quickly and efficiently though. I reordered the item and this one doesn't have the cloth interior and seems to be more solidly made. Just received the second one, but so far so good. Definitely looks to be better made.Wallet itself is a bit bigger than I anticipated, but working out fine. At least it forced me to clean out my wallet of unnecessary junk. I really like the compartments on this wallet and how they are organized. Works out perfectly. I would recommend it."
5,Perfect Essential Wallet,"I keep a typical bi-fold wallet in my briefcase but also maintain a slim wallet to use for going out to dinner, movies, shopping, etc. This wallet is perfect. Cash compartment, 3 slots for cards, and a clear sleeve for your identification card. Slips flatly into a front or back pocket. Perfect!!"
3,Classy but not quality.,"Perfect for going out and fits well in front pocket. I keep 3 plastic cards, 2 IDs, and 3 business cards in it and it is still very slim! Doesn't stretch out of shape and holds form very nicely.Edit: Reduced from 5 stars to 3 stars. The wallet lasted about 9 months before the clear plastic started to crack. It lasted for one year before the plastic was too cracked to hold an ID. Great starter wallet or occasional use item."
4,So far so good,The wallet is nice and simple and very slim just like I wanted. It is forcing me not to keep too much junk in my wallet. It also looks very stylish. Let's hope i can still say this in 6 montha.m.
5,"I don't like thick wallets, but I do need to carry several cards with me","This is the perfect wallet if you want something thin,but can carry enough credit cards and ids. It supposed to be a ""front"" pocket wallet, but I stick in my back pocket and go. Sitting on a thick wallet all day is not good for your back, so having this wallet was a great solution for me."
5,Awesome wallet,"This wallet is quite thin, which is what I was looking for. It's very nice looking as the leather is high quality and the stitching looks quite nice. Great deal for $22."
3,Nice and slim but some annoying traits,"This wallet is decent for those looking for a slim wallet but a couple things would prevent me from purchasing the same one. The leather is of good quality and with 4 cards inside it fits in my front pocket without any noticeable bulge. It has a clear plastic window for the driver's license; however, it gets dirty easily and starts to look a bit ugly. I would prefer the mesh that you see on other wallets. There is about half a centimeter of extra leather along the edge of the cash pocket that seems completely unnecessary. Removing this would make this wallet even more compact. Lastly, the stitching on my wallet has started to unravel at the edge.For the price it is satisfactory but I will look for something that has had more thought put into it for my next wallet. Perhaps I will try the Slimmy."
4,A little bit larger than I wanted,"I bought this so that I could easily flash my I.D. to get on the public transportation and it does that nicely. What I don't particularly care for is that the wallet is about a half inch to a full inch taller than a credit card. This is a personal opinion and other's may not feel the same, but it does do a very nice job of making you forget that it is in your front pocket. Good Job Dopp!"
2,poor quality,I was excited to get this because of the minimalist but efficient design but sadly it showed up brand new and ripped. The stitching and/or leather was not quality and couldn't even make it to me together. I would have liked an exchange hoping it was a fluke but that wasn't an option so I just returned it. Wouldn't recommend.
2,Too small,Too small for my needs. Buy only if you have a few cards and a little cash to put in it. I miss my Walmart $8 wallet and will probably go back to that.
1,fell apart in 3 days,"started tearing in 3 days, totally falling apart 2 weeks later, items falling out of it and pockets don't hold anything anymore. totally worthless already."
2,Front ID pocket was too loose,"I was eagerly looking forward to getting this nice slim wallet after seeing it in action by two of my friends who own (and like) theirs, but unfortunately, the one I was shipped was defective. Upon receipt and new, the front clear ID pocket was already too loose to even hold one ID card tightly - merely flipping over the wallet caused the ID to fall out. This was probably just a defective single product (as I've seen two very functional versions), but nevertheless, had to return it."
3,Liner that holds CC tore,"I'm on my second one of these. The first one lasted fairly long, the 2nd one I ordered at the end of March 2010. The in-liner that holds the credit cards and where you would typically place a couple of business cards ripped at the stitching a few months ago. I don't jam many card into the wallet - typically 5 cards total for the 3 card slots and nothing in the business card pouch. I may order another one but was a bit surprised how quickly this on 'fell apart'. Though I'm able to use it really, the cards aren't as snug and need to be tucked in quite often."
5,Perfect Front Pocket Wallet,I have been using this since early August. Just the right size. The dollar bills pocket is well designed for both easy access and security.
3,"Dopp Wallet, pros and cons","I was looking for thin minimalist kind of wallet and the Dopp front pocket does deliver.I do have a hard time getting my credit cards out of the deep packets on the outside of the wallet.Also I put my cash folded in the middle opening/pocket that is closed on two adjacent sides and open on two adjacent sides. If I have much cash (wish is not very often), it does make the wallet quite a bit fatter but not terribly fat.The wallet is well constructed of good materials.The Dopp front pocket is a reasonable minimalist front packet wallet."
4,Smaller the better!,"I like a small wallet, and this fits the bill (pun intended). Its a great little wallet for someone who only wants to carry a few credit cards, ID, a couple business cards and some bills. It seems well made. The last one I had lasted a few years, and I am sure this will do about the same."
5,Great wallet!,"This wallet was everything I was hoping it would be: compact, classic-looking, and of quality construction. It is a definite upgrade from my husband's ""throw everything in the pocket"" approach."
3,"Great design, but leather quality is?","My purchase replaces nearly the same model from Dopp. I wore the first one out after a few years. Design is still great, but leather seems much thinner. Would pay several dollars more for one with more durable appearing leather."
4,"Functional, slim","Bought this wallet when in search of a slim wallet. I was so tired of a lumpy wallet throwing of my spine alignment and bulging out the back. When I decided to pare down my wallet contents to only the necessary this was one of the two wallets I picked up. It now serves as my second wallet.I use the Slimmy wallet as my everyday wallet as it has only three slots. It's perfectly minimalist. A pen can also be attached to it. The Dopp Regatta wallet is a nice option, good quality, and with more storage slots than the Slimmy. I wouldn't have bought it if I'd gotten the Slimmy first. It does a fine job of housing less used cards. Why we even have cards anymore is another question. Should just be a phone and cash."
2,Incorrect sizing,"They are advertised as 4"" on Amazon and elsewhere but are actually 3.5"" outside outlet diameter. These are just longer 8"" versions of the other 3.5"" tips that Pilot offers and are not larger in diameter. It even states 3.5"" on the packaging. They are okay though. Good quality. I'll probably keep it but I really wanted 4"". I looked everywhere for an affordable 4"" tip and thought I had it with this one...I was wrong."
4,Impressionists poke fun at Actors. Funny!,"On this CD, a pair of impressionists poke fun at hollywood actors; predominantly Arnold Schwarzenegger, Tom Cruise, Russell Crowe, Keanu Reeves, and John Travolta.The CD follows celebrity antics at the Hollywood Motel and then at the Big-Head awards (take off on the Oscars).The impressions are pretty good. The captured mannerisms are great. There is some bathroom humor at the beginning and its funny...even though I should be too old to find such things funny.At the end of the CD you even get a Director's Commentary ... a spoof on the common DVD extra."
2,Basic writings on an important topic,"This is not a book but really a collection of dozens of short articles. Most of the articles are only two to three pages in length and are fairly high level and basic. You can probably find similar overviews and high level outlines by doing a web search. Very basic stuff, but if you don't know the rudimentary fundamentals like ""How to Run a Meeting"" or that ""All Project Members Should be Treated Equally"" then you might find some value in this book."
4,Like the flat bottom...,"This is a nice sized strainer...larger for bigger jobs. The bottom is flattened so you can set it down without it turning on its side. The sides have a 1"" plus plastic depth, so you could pile stuff in. Looks like it should last."
4,Juicer,I am pleased to have this product. It's good looking and sleek and fits on my counter very nicely.
4,a 400 lb. bench press for the mind....,"A wide ranging romp through the minds of the philosophers, theologians, physicists, and mathematicians that make up much of Western Thought.The lives, motivations, major works and ideas of Plato, Martin Luther, Voltaire, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, Charles Darwin, and over one-hundred more big-brained sorts are covered by 35 equally brainy scholars, in short chapters, averaging about 5 pages apiece; most of the writing here is quite readable, but some were, at least for me, like wading through sludge.Suggested reading is provided for those who wish to furter their studies of the intellectually-abundant."
3,For the coffee table only,This book was fair but not the type of book you can't put down. The problem is that too many individuals are covered and in too little detail. It reads like a dictionary.
5,Beautiful,"Beautiful prisms, fast delivery. I will be ordering more from this vendor. Make sure you put them in a safe place once delivered. My 4 year old granddaughter saw the bubble wrap and grabed it. I lost 6 prisms. :("
4,Fun Game,"Fun game, realistic play. Hard and challenging at first but easier once you get the hang of it. Sidecar is the hardest overall until you learn how to brake and when to also.In order to unlock new tracks on the arcade mode you must place 1st in the top ones. So do not get frustrated if you get second and the other does not unlock.For the new price it is definately worth it!Most fun part is the trial sections, you must complete certian obsticles to unlock more things.Highly recommended."
5,The closest I'll ever get to riding the IOM TT,"Just like being there, I think. Beautiful graphics and realism. Bike reacts much more progressivly than other games (less frusterating over-controler inputs) The real star of the game is the course. Truly authentic simulation of the actual TT course. Can't wait to try the sidecar race mode!"
2,Not the greatist game,"I didn't play much past the first level, couldn't get into the game. The graphics are really bad, the first track was really boring and very plain. To much effort in just balancing the bike, very poor control of it."
4,Looks fine...,"It's just a shot glass, but looks and works fine (although logo is a bit large).Bit too small for espresso though (although it looks sexy). I prefer my marked 1.5 oz shot glass that leaves a bit more room at the top for you to pick it up without burning your fingers."
1,Look for a shot glass with additional measuring units,"I found at a housewares store (Bed Bath & Beyond or the like) a shot glass with several different units of measurement: fluid ounces, teaspoons, tablespoons (in half-tablespoon increments) and ML's. Much more useful than this product, especially if you're measuring for weight loss purposes and can have EXACTLY two and a half tablespoons of that salad dressing."
4,Uhhhh Freud Needed Help.,I know that Sigmund Freud had a plethora of black statutes that filled one of his rooms. The statues were of black men with erections. Was Freud a phallic worshipper? Or was he only into Black Phalluses? Who else idolized black phalluses? Adolph Hitler. I am sure there are explanations about these historical men and their seeming idolatry. Who was capable of putting Freud and Hitler on the couch and anal-yzing them?
1,Tell me more,"Two drunken fellows, one Irish & the other Jewish, were in a barroom bellowing their dispute as to whose history was a bigger deal, the Irish or the Jewish. The Irishman said, ""in Ireland expert archaeologists have been excavating. And they found, among other evidence of high civilization, fine gold wire. Proving that in Ireland they had the telegraph!"". The Jewish fellow jumped up and said, ""and in Israel, expert archaeologists have been excavating. And they found no wires! Proving that in Israel, we had the wireless!""Then Richard M.D. King came in the door. Both these guys looked at him and shouted, ""And in Africa, what was invented?""Richard M.D. King said, ""In Africa, they invented BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY.""""And what the jingo is that?!"" they shouted.""The theory that most of mankind is genetically programmed to demonstrate that most of mankind is an ass"" said the bartender, Sigmund Freud."
1,Buyer Beware,I recieved the 3 milk frothers over 4 weeks late. All three do not work. I recieved one new one in the mail. This worked for several minutes with brand new batteries before it stopped working altogether. I am sincerely disappointed and I feel like I have been ripped off.
4,ok for $5,"Works OK as a mixer, which is why I bought it for my mom. It saves her having to hand mix in a powdered medicine that used to clump up on her. On occasions it will start and then stop or need some coaxing to get going, but it has been a blessing overall. Anyone buying this and expecting a $30 high quality item...is truly foolish. To read about their disappointment is actually humorous."
3,dissapointed,"The prior three activity books have been a great addition to our homeschooling, but this activity book vol 4 was a huge dissapointment. It contains mostly maps. We get plenty of maps in the reading book. This looks to be more appropriate for older grades. It is not as useful for the younger grades which was the benefit of her other books, they were great for all levels. Not this one."
4,Helpful,"This book has been very helpful in planning a history curriculum. Other reviewers are correct the ditto portion you can copy is mainly maps. It is also a bit weaker than the other books in this group. However, despite those two complaints, this is a very useful book when planning curriculum for a homeschool student. There are discussion topics, craft ideas and more."
5,More tools...,"I didn't think I'd be as happy with this book as I was with Vols. 2&3, but even though the reading lists aren't as extensive, I'm thrilled with the timeline cards & PRONUNCIATION GUIDE! If they were in the other volumes, I missed them. It's such a great idea to have the pronunciation guide when you read aloud! My DD9 will learn how to relate historical events so much better using the timeline cards as well. Can't WAIT to get going!"
2,great curriculum- not crazy about the activity book,"We really enjoy the book this activity book is a supplement to, but I really feel like this activity book doesn't add that much and is actually a little complicated. My third grader had a lot of trouble figuring out what they were asking for on many pages, and I agreed. I like having something to review the material with, but this wasn't that great..."
2,A Poor Addition to a Great Series,"While the books are very good, these activity books are written/developed for a much younger crowd. Fine if you are using them for elementary students in a home school environment. Not very challenging or invigorating for a child that can read the book by themselves."
2,Big and cheap,"Made to lay on counter or hang, to bulky for more than one in my silverware drawer. Stamped metal part is not finished well if at all, cheap like 99 cent store stuff. I lightly buffed the edges to remove the rough unfinished edge(it will probably rust now).Go to a store and get one that you like. If your only wanting one why not get a nice one?"
1,boring stuff,This dvd contains a lot of old black & white wrestling stuff but it is not interesting at all. It contains a small black & white movie which is about a female wrestler and also a long boring catfight with very bad sound and picture. If you love womens wrestling and catfighting do not buy this movie.
1,Deceptive marketing,"I found this DVD with a search on Amazon which auto-completed with the words ""facesitting DVDs."" Two reviewers referred to scenes involving facesitting - one specifically, ""Pindown Girls."" This and any other scenes on this ""camp"" DVD showing films from the 1940's included *NO* facesitting scenes, whatsoever, *ANYWHERE* on this DVD. Nor were there any instances of mixed wrestling - a total misrepresentation of the product.If this is what you're looking for, you won't find it here."
1,Garbage.,My daughter dropped this from about a foot and a half on carpet and the thing scattered into half a dozen irreparable pieces.Absolute garbage - don't waste your money.
3,Emerson 12 LED Lantern,"The lantern is bigger than I thought it would be, but not as bright. The light is harsh. The batteries should last far longer than the similar sized incandescent lantern I have, but I'd rather have more pleasant lighting unless it was an emergency backup.At least it doesn't hiss like the old Coleman gas lanterns."
2,Excellenr price so-so light output,"About a year I paid about $40 each for two Essential Gear 12 LED lanterns--one for me and another to give as a Xmas present.After receiving these I saw these Innovage lanterns for less than half the price (about $15.00 each). I was annoyed at myself for spending so much for the E Gears, and bought these too. Again one for me and one for an Xmas gift.Today we had a power failure and for the first time I tried both lanterns in near total darkness. The extra money we spent on the Essential Gears was money well spent. The light output was significantly brighter and I was able to read (with the E Gear) in relative confort. Less so with the Innovage."
2,Just So SO,This lantern is useful but doesn't work as described. The Brightening/Dimming control doesn't work so it should not be advertised as such. Just another foreighn product that doesn't work.Emerson indoor/outdoor 12-led utility lantern
2,not a bright light,Not satisfied with this light. They claim very bright but this is not that bright atalll.
2,Not that great...,"I bought two of these lanterns to take on a Girl Scout camping trip. I also had some other kinds of lamps there. None of the girls wanted to use the Innovage lanterns, because they were not bright at all. I was pretty disappointed."
2,more light reflected from the moon on my boyfriends head than from this lametern,What a waste. 4 Ginormous 'D' Batteries for what? Is there some secret function that we dont know of yet? the light is less than helpful. not even close to a lantern. get an over the ear LED of some sort...they're so much brighter and always light what you need to look at. This thing SUCKS!
4,"Folks, Lighten Up!","It is true that the lantern is not the brightest and the ""D"" cells do make it heavy, so... leave it in the closet when you go camping. But get ready for glare, hissing, burned out mantles and fuel spills with those Colemans. My LED lantern is excellent for home power outages. It is still illuminating just fine after 48 hours (and with no muss or fuss). Is it built like a tank? No, but the price and performance made me suggest it to a neighbor."
4,Agree with lighten up!,"For inside emergency use during power outages - perfect, and the 4 D-cells last forever. No, it isn't the brightest bulb in the house or the lightest in weight - but I can see to do everything I need during an emergency - and the price is right. It may not last forever but I hope we don't have that many outages."
2,Not bright enough,The light is really not bright enough for general use so I would not recommend this product.
2,Not for the young ones...,"This book is VERY much geared to dealing with older children and even teenagers. I have a 2-year-old and this was not very helpful. The ""helping you understand"" behavior stuff and how you may contribute to it and all that is appropriate for any age, of course, and some good points were made - for that, and that alone, I gave this the 3 stars. But if you're looking for actual help - meaning what exactly can you do to make things better with a young toddler/preschooler, I'd really suggest looking at some of the other books more geared to that age group. (You'll get the same 'helping you understand the behavior"" stuff in those, too.) This one is much better if you're struggling with a willful 7-8+ year old."
4,Average rating - some papers 4-5 stars; some less,"This is the standard collection of Davidson's early writings on events, action, and some of his work on the philosophy of mind and psychology. Some of the papers are very good (""The Logical Form of Action Sentences"" is rightly regarded as a classic) whereas some other papers (e.g. ""Mental Events"") are obscure and confused. The latter suffers from (apparently) a lack of contact with how psychology (and in particular, cognitive neuroscience) is practiced. I nevertheless recommend the volume as a good collection of papers by one of the 20th century's more influential philosophers. I should note in passing that Davidson's current views on the individuation of events are not discussed in any of the papers. For that, see _Actions and Events: Perspectives on the Philosphy of Donald Davidson_ and his article ""Reply to Quine on Events"" therein."
5,Every BossTone fan deserves this Video!!,"ok, fist off, I read some of the coments made before someone who said Dicky, at the beginning of this video had long hair? Sorry, sister, he NEVER had LONG HAIR!!Anyway, any and every BossTone fan should get this video!! It was sooo good, I've watched it over and over and over.... It's also nice to see them grow up and ( somewhat) mature!!! This band ROCKS!!!!! A neat cameo by Gene from KISS in this video, too!"
5,Signed book by President Harry S. Truman,"The book is entitled ""Mr Citizen"" and was written and signed by Harry S. Truman. It's a very interesting book by one of our greatest presidents."
5,Should Be In Every Comedy Fan's Collection,"Harry Shearer needs no introduction for those who like to laugh-- for more than 20 years he's been familiar in Spinal Tap and SNL and The Simpsons and all over the place providing trenchant satire at every turn. These clip from his radio show are not just funny (though they are VERY funny)-- they're incisive in ways that comedy usually isn't. It's biting parody of radio genres and topics that have never been skewered before. Listen to ""Honey, I Slept With The Kids"" for an example. And as an instance of brilliant improv, the lengthy interview with a confused and bitter gender-reassignment recipient may be the most inspired you'll ever hear. Shearer richly deserves the success he's found as the voice of Charles Montgomery Burns and Wayland Smithers and Ned Flanders, but after listening to this, you'll have a much better notion of his comedic instincts. They're dead on."
4,Where's the gratitude?,"This is a collection of funny songs and comedy skits from Harry Shearer's radio show ""Le Show"". Le Show is now in its twenty-first year of award-unwinning service to the world. It's heard on radio stations all over America (except for Washington and Boston--that's what I call sophistication). The CD features material from the early '90s. It's funny but somewhat dated, dealing with topics like George Bush and the invasion of Iraq. Wait, maybe it's not so dated after all."
5,A unique approach to Jewish identity,"While there are many works that address Jewish identity from any number of perspectives (sociological, theological, etc.), this work studies it from a new perspective: through the analysis of case studies of people who discovered their Jewish roots as adults. The author pays particular attention to the ""crypto-Jews"" who are descendants of Spanish and Portuguese Jews, Holocaust survivors, and the ""hidden children"" of the Holocaust. She is non-judgemental in her approach, seeking to understand how each individual came into contact with his/her Judaism, and their reactions to their new status. The book's final chapter is an intelligent analysis of Jewish identity in light of the case studies presented."
5,"Suddenly Jewish - a thoughtful, multivariate viewpoint","I very much enjoyed this work - a well sewn quilt of disparate pieces craftily held together by the author's commentary and observations. I was especially impressed by those who were moderate in their approach - such as Rosemary on page 94 ""Israel didn't feel like home, but I was glad I went."" (Maybe less ""suddenly"" than others.) I never can take fully seriously the ""big bang theory"" -- something like ""I saw a corned beef sandwhich, and that moment I knew I was Jewish. I gave myself a bris, bought a black hat, a minivan and a yarmulke and ....""Enjoy."
5,Excellent,"Reading ""Suddenly Jewish"" I found myself alternately laughing and crying. The stories were so moving. Each of the four categoris (Hidden Children of the Holocaust, Children of Holocaust Survivors, Adoptees, Crypto-Jews) was different but what they had in common was an insistence on truth. I believe that people have an inner voice telling them who they are, and this book confirmed my belief. It was a wonderful read,both serious and enormously entertaining."
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"This poetry book by a thirteen year old learning disabled child opens the doors for all of us as writers and readers. It allows both children and adults to recognize their own ""personal disability"", maybe something no one sees, and realize that all are conquerable! The prologue and epilogue include Samantha speaking, her parents, and her english teacher...these three points of view bring an in depth view of the ""gift within us all"" just waiting to be recognized and nurtured. This is a must read for anyone who touches the lives of children!"
5,Compelling,"""Angels in the Architecture"" is a first-rate homage to a former asylum, the Traverse City State Hospital of Michigan. Heidi Johnson has masterfully combined her hauntingly beautiful photographs with both archival material and first-hand reports from the trenches. The result is a powerfully compelling journey into the soul of a once vibrant institution that provided care to thousands of its wards."
5,Angles in the Architecture,"To Heidi....What a beautiful and important history of theTraverse City State Hospital she has complied...For her workand due diligence...I offer this poem of gratitude. ""Angelsin the Architecture""Captures by lens and aperturePoignancies of patients plights,The ennui of endless days, nights,The efforts made to alleviateUnhappiness and to pacificate.The book presnts a cameoOf how it was so long ago,The sunlit wards, the kind nurses,A sick person's plaintive verses.The volume is a worthy tributeTo angles aiding the destiture."
3,Be careful when selecting your size,"The stretcher is definitely helping, but I think I should have gotten a size smaller. I wear a size 9 women's, and my goal was to stretch out the toe box of my fancy high heels...but the stretcher is too wide to fit all the way down into the toe! It still does some good for stretching near the sides of the ball of the foot, but I wish I had ordered down a size and then I think it would work better for what I actually needed it for. Otherwise, it seems to be put together pretty well. Some of the peg holes were shoddily bored, so the moveable metal pieces to target-stretch that area can't be inserted all the way. I haven't tried to clean them out though - I bet that could be worked around."
4,Great Job,It did a great job on my high heel booties. I used it along with a shoe stretching spray. I must say that I wish it was little more narrower for my pointy toe heels but both my shoes feel so much better.
4,Not for Typical High Heeled Shoes,"This is one of the better shoe stretchers I've purchased through Amazon, but have yet to find one that is angled correctly for true high heels.I read one review awhile ago where someone took a bandsaw to theirs, with excellent results. I'm still asking around for the use of a bandsaw, because that makes sense to curve it to a higher degree. As it is, these do work with 2-3 inch heels and especially platform shoes, but I wish they sold one that would work in 4 or 5 inch heels, too."
2,not good,"The wood of the item was not finished very well, was rough all over. Also when I used it the 1. time the wood split and I had to return it"
4,A little off in size,"This did stretch my heels out a little when I needed it after my broken toes. The toes did not heel perfectly, but my shoes can now fit again!"
4,"Good for high heels, not so much for small shoes","I got this product to stretch a pair of Louboutin heels. These shoes are notorious for being all over the board with sizing. I bought a 5.5 because the 6 was a little too big and flipped off my feet when I walked. The 5.5 were great length-wise but didn't give much in the width. This product worked well at stretching the shoes just enough to fit me much better. The only thing is, it wouldn't fit very far into the shoe. So the tip of the toe (which is just slightly pointed) didn't get any stretch at all.I only stretched each shoe for about 2hrs. and that was all it needed. It's still a little tight towards the front of the shoe, but at least now I can stand and walk in them for hours without wanting to cry. Also, the shoes are 4.5 inches high and there was no problem."
1,poorly made,"the back part of the wood was so wide, it would stretch out my shoes in the wrong place (right before the ankles). i couldn't use it at all. returned it."
5,need more plugs,I've had this stretcher and it worked nicely until I moved and lost the plugs!! I have searched the Internet but can't find where to buy more plugs. Does anyone know where to get them?
2,Too big for my shoes,I have a size 7 shoe and this was way too big for them. Could barely fit it in at the front even without the little metal inserts.
1,Pointless,"I wanted this little shoe stretcher to work, but it did nothing but create lumps in the wrong places in my shoes. If you have wide feet and think this will stretch out your shoes forget it."
2,You Can Do Better,"For starters, I thought at this price there'd be two stretchers but there's just the one. It's also only good for stretching out the width of your toes - it won't be able to do anything for heels or length.And after writing this I'm seriously considering sending it back."
3,Not sure it helped me much,It's probably a good product but it did not work for me. I should have kept my money and taken the shoes to a professional.
1,What was I thinking?,"I didn't pay close attention when I ordered this... silly me for thinking that just because the shoes come in pairs, that the stretcher would too. Why would I only want to stretch one shoe at a time? Why would I want to pay twice this for that priviledge? I have to learn to pay closer attention for what they are NOT telling you, before I put an item in the cart from now on."
3,Its okay,"I needed something to stretch out the top of my tango shoes. The heel height is 3.5"". The angle of this particular stretcher is not getting it and I will have to take the previous suggestions and file it into shape. Also, the metal nubs are a great idea, but not what I need for my shoe. It would be great if they were removable and could be attached as needed. A few adjustments and I will try it out on a test pair first."
1,poor quality,"after widening the stretcher, it won't go back to it's original position, it was such a struggle to get it out of the shoe. my second product from the company. the first one was poorly rated too then someone from the company called me and asked me to remove my negative comment and in exchange would ship me a new product. gullible me, took out the comment, no product came. learned my lesson. stay away from this company."
3,high heel shoe stretcher,"I was disappointed with this product when I tried to stretch my pointy shoes and could NOT reach the toe box area. In the other shoes I stretched with a rounded toe, it worked well."
3,it's ok,These shoe stretchers fit ok in high heel shoes eventhough sometimes the back of the shoe is deformed due to the weight of the stretcher.
2,"Good Idea, Badly Portrayed","I felt like they really could've done something with this, but instead went nowhere. The main character had an amazing actor and I believe they gave him a mental illness as well. Instead of explaining some more things, it was just an hour and a half of confusion. I was really looking forward to this, but unfortunately, I was very disappointed"
3,Intriguing Story,"Seemed like a movie out of a Smiths album. Pensive. Worth seeing again. It's good to see movies coming out of China, although they are still conservative by Western standards."
1,terrible game!!!! by Will Elkins,I hate this game! My friends play it all the time. They say bad things in the songs and it's totally unrealistic. There's even nitrus! I think this game should be rated T.
4,This Game Offers It All!!!,"I wanted to share after reading other reviews. This game does not have the fastest of fast cars like a Ferrari and so forth but it has cars that you see everyday racing in your town. Yes, it does have a Ford Focus and Dodge Neon but those are the worst on there, they have Acuras, Hondas, Mitsubishis, etc. The cool thing is the better you get you can win better cars and win things to unlock features to keep hyping them up! It has a wide range of cars and you can make every aspect of them from the engine colors to the rim colors and styles, hoods, lights, window tinting all your own! Keep racing and winning to unlock more cool features to make better cars."
1,B.S. AI,"This game SUCKS. the ai is totaly cheat, the cars are too fast traffic sucks, drifting is just skidding over the track like an idiot, the tracks are all the same, the only good thing about this game is drag racing."
1,BBBBBOOOOORRRIIIINNNNNGGGGG!!!!!!!!,"This game is so boring! The cars suck, the upgrades suck and the tracks aren't open. This racing game is the worst. Plus there are no cops so no point in even driving on free runs. I love EA, and the graphics are great but there's no good, fun game to go with it. I think that this game is like Midnight Club 1, but even that is better. At least there are good cars in that and you can drive all over the downtown of a city. This game has BORING written all over it."
4,One of the best racing games yet...,"NFS Underground is the ideal racing game. It shows street racing at it's best with hot cars, beautiful graphics, and amazing gameplay. The only downside is how fast paced it is. When you're driving at 140 mph in the game, the street and the cars go as fast as that so it's kind of hard to keep up with the turn's. And another thing I don't like is the traffic. It seems to just pop up in front of me after a sharp turn and I'm in the lead. Maybe it's because it's on hard, I dunno. But w.e it is, it's very aggravating."
4,THIS IS URE PRIDE ON THE LINE,"As 1 of the greatist RACING games out there and a repution of a gold mine this is 1 of the greatist games out there. { Others like Gran tiursmo 4 will give this game comp. } u start as a newbe to the religon of street racin,as u climb ure way to the top of the ranks. As with the drawbridge stunt in 2 FAST 2 FUREIOS {that was preety cool}u can do that to.There is a good drag racing mode and watch out for traffic.With a lot {did i mention a LOT}of custimisables like rims,decals,inteere,and those cool neon lights under the cars {god i want some of those}."
5,sickest game ive ever played,"This game has the best gfx, the best playablity, and the best soundtrack ive ever seen heard or played. and plus u can play online with other peoples kitted-up cars, i dont think u can get better than this game, if u like racing car games , if u like action games, if u like and game , then this game has got it all"
4,Don't finish the game!!!!!!,"Don't finish all the races in Underground Mode. You will lose all your cars in the Quick-Race Mode and your favorite Underground car. You will unlock everything, but lose all to special cars that you've won during the Underground. Advice play up to the last two races or use a different memory card to save your cars. Good luck."
3,Wrong Console,You sent me a gamecube game not a ps2 game as pictured in the product. I am very upset considering i dont have a gamecube.
2,games not finished,poor chat in online play poor car modifacation useless effects etc...only real good thing i can say about the game is the graphics but gameplay is far more important to me......i bought mine and returned it if you want a total arcade racer you may like.......there is all kind of cheats online whichs makes it absolutly no fun at all i'd wait for gt4 myself this game will probley be in the 9.99 bin soon enough
4,this game has the best racing graphics ever!,"that is until Gran Turismo 4 comes out...this game is a lot of fun. my friend owns this game, and ive played with him online b4. the online play is a big part of the game because otherwise there would be nothing to do after you beat the game. so good job EA GAMES! and i would like to add that the soundtrack is awesome!"
1,Buy Tokyo Xtreme Racer instead!,"I bought this game because of the hype that it DOES NOT live up to. First, the graphics are both blurry and grainy at the same time. It's almost impossible to see what on the track or even the track itself! Second, it's WAY to hard. If you hit a car, tree or even scrape a guardrail alittle to hard you need to restart the race. You will NOT be able to catch up. If your interested in a good street racing game the go buy Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero or TXR3! These 2 games are much better the this pile of cr@p!"
1,not what u might expect,Dis game is called need fo speed UNDAGROUND. I thought u could actually race unda tha ground. maybe even dig up tha dirt n take a good ol' mud truck or a good mud car but no. U race ABOVE ground. i paid $50 for dis game so i am very disspointed as u can c. So sad. they shouldve called it need fo speed ABOVEGROUND cuz it aint relly underground. misleading yup it is. dont get it cuz u cant really race unda tha ground. which stinkz. peace out homies and undaground(real undaground) fanz.
2,never play this game!,"i played this game with my 3 year old cousin and he loved it, but when it was my turn to play i thouht it was ok. But then i played it again and i didnt like it! So inless you are 3 to 9 years old, or abbssesed with race car games you will not like this game."
1,WASTE OF $$$$$ NOW,"midnight club 2 is cheaper!!! why buy tis for $50 wehn you can get midnight club 2 for less. Cheeper is beter, alwahyz."
1,i am a charlie fan,hi i am a charlies fan and i neber heard of this gane but it look cool and i want to play i also saw charlie review this and i love charlie and so does my friend larry and i am at school but i should go cause i am at school i going on vacation so you not see any review from me for a week i be gone for a week cause i going on vacation i neber play this game but amanda say it cool so i think it cool i love this game it the best i gibe it 5 stars when i get home from school i review school then i review vaction keep in tune..dee quizono subs
4,yeah no shi* ITS A GOOD GAME!,LISTEN I ROTE IN MY LIFE ABOUT 40 REVIEWS FOR THIS GAME AND IM SICK OF IT I DIDNT LIKE IT ON XBOX BECAUSE THE CONTROLS BLEW YOU HAD TO USE THE R BUTTON AND IF YOU CHANGE IT TO THE A BUTTON YOU HAVE TO JAM IT DOWN REALLY HARD IM NOT BREAKIN MY CONTROLLER!!! EVEN KNOW I LOVE XBOX AND I HATE PS2! SEE FOR PS2 ITS PREETYN COOL THOW ONLINE PLAY THE GRAPHICS ARE OUTSTANDING NICE MUSIC LIL JON AND CRAP BUT IT REALLY FITS OUT THE BEST FOR THE CUBE! THE CONTROLS WERE GREAT SAME LOOKIN GRAPHICS YOU CAN BARALY TELL I RECOMEMND THIS FOR THE GAMECUBE! OK CHARLIE V1 IS SICK OF THIS GAME IM NEVER WRITING A REVIEW FOR THIS AGAIN ! PEACE!SORRY FOR MY NET GOING OFF IT MIGHT SOON SO I MIGHT NOT BE ON FOR A LONG TIME AND REMEMBER TADPOLE (THOMAS) WELL HES GONE HE DOESNT EVEN LIKE TO WRITE REVIEWS FOR YOU ANYMORE VOTE FOR ME CHARLIE V1 AND THIS REVIEW TELLS IT ALL THIS IS REALLY NOT A PRO REVEIEW IM JUST SO SICK OF THIS GAME WRITING FOR IT!
4,Nice.......,"This game has pretty good graphic's and styling cars. I like that you can create and manage your cars, and not just choose and race. You can be in DRAG,CITY, and many more races. You can even be on magizine covers, if you win a lot and have cool looking cars. This is a pretty good game."
2,"Crashes SUCK, unfair AI, lame courses, no cops or replay.","Those are all the lame things about this game. The nice thing about Hot Pursuit is that the cops tend to even things out a bit, so even if you get just worked over by a helicopter dropping incendiaries, chances are your rivals will be getting it soon. In this one -- I mean really -- how easy is it to hit a car when you're traveling 150 mph through a tight city street with trafffic? Answer : VERY EASY. Well too bad none of the AI cars hardly ever hit a thing (and when they do they recover in two seconds), but when you inevitably do, it looks like you drove off the Grand Canyon. Makes for a very annoying and UNFUN gaming experience!"
2,fun until u realize its not,"I purchased this game right when it came out, and i was pretty excited after seeing screenshots and movies online. Very nice graphics and a decent soundtrack (lil jon and the eastside boys excluded) Well 1st thing i would like to say is my 1st impression was pretty good, but getting further into the game it just got really frustrating, as the computer is almost impossible to beat, and some of the race tracks are ridiculous. Another thing is why is an RSX faster then a supra~ ridiculous!It has got to the point where i would be yelling profanities at the tv screen. Best racing game ever?! hmmmmm thats definately questionable , with a measly small choice of cars and somewhat weak gameplay u can expect GT4 to wipe this game out< i gave it 2 stars for NOS and ONline PLAY"
4,awesome game,"This is a great game, the graphics are great, the controls are great, the customizible features are great the soundtrack is okay (except for lil' john and mystical there awesome)it's a perfect game. Except for one thing: the cars. Whatz ^ w/ these cars? I mean, in the previous one we had Prsches, Lamborghinis, McLarens, Mercedes, Lotus, and BMW. Now we have A PUEGEOUT? A CIVIC? A SENTRA, HYNDAIS????? Whatz ^ w/ that? I know everyone now likes the ""fast and furious"" cars, so i'll give u fast. Go put a civic, a sentra. a peugeout, and a mclaren in drag racing. who would win? the Mclaren DUH. awesome game"
2,SUCKS EGGS!!!,"This game sucks. PLain an simple. It's a good thing I rented it first. There's no variety in the courses. I felt like I was stuck riding the same course over and over again. The cars are cheesy too, and so are the mods you can do to them. The drag racing is ok but gets boring after a while. Some music tracks were ok. It's a good thing that you can turn some of the tracks off though because i'd say a good half of them suck bad. The only good thing about the game is the graphics and speed you get while driving. Those are top notch. For that i'll give it 2 stars. I no doubt had a better time playing Need For Speed 2: Hot Pursuit. If you want the best game in the series, that's the one to buy."
4,yo charlie V1 IS COMINGGGGGG SOOOONNN,MY NET IS COMING BACK EGT READY THOMAS AND MY FANS OUT THERE THAT WANNA SE ME AGAIN IM COMINGGGGGG NFS U IS SWEET ON GAMECUBE SORRY I CNAT WRITE A REVIEW RITE NOW CAUSE AT SCHOOL G2G PEACE OUT DONT VOTE FOR THOMAS CHARIE V1 NAAA
4,great game but gets dull,"This is a great game. I only borrowed it from my friend and it took me a few weeks to beat. I like the fact that you can customize your car from the performance, to the neon, to the windows, and all the way to the engine paint, and brake capillers. Wicked fun game, with awesome music, like all of the need for speed games. The only downside to the game is that it is really hard at level 99 to 101, which is good, but after that it is really easy, and blows the end of the game. it also get old after you beat it like most games, but it is fun to play with friends after it is beat, not just by yourself. It is by far the best street racing game so far, much better then midnight club. I would recommend buying it"
4,Do You Have The Need For Speed?,"Need For Speed: Underground is one of the best installments in the series. Underground features extensive levels, character models, and of course, cars to get you into the game. After five minutes of playing you will be in awe. With car customizing this game is like a fantasy ""The Fast And The Furious"". You have to use your driving skills to win the races and tournaments and new modes including ""Drag"" and Japanese ""Drift"", to make your way to the top in this game. The only thing that would make this better is extensive levels where you can travel as you wish like in NFS: Hot Pursuit 2."
4,Okay........but fun,"Need For Speed Underground is an overall okay game.Here are some pros and cons to this ""so called game"":Pros)1:The cars are realllllly nice. Very realistic and fast.2:The body kits are nice especially the Wide Body Kits.3:Grapics are very good.Cons)1:Racing: Very difficult in Career mode especially race 81.2:NO FREE ROAM!!!3:CRASHING! Traffic cars appear right in front of you and you crash.Overall i'll give it 4. Very frustrating. If you like difficulty, you'll like this game.(TOOK ME FOREVER TO BEAT)"
3,ausome,"N4SU is a great game. u can add unlimited customazation to the car. 1 thing i didn't like was the limited variety of cars. i would have liked 2 eventually work up to get a McLaren or a lamborgini or even a BMW but u could only pick from common cars like honda and ford. another con was the sensitivity of the throtte (i had to basicly push the button into the controller to reach a conpetable speed). yet another was the damgage. u could just tap a car while goin 30 mph and u'd do about 10 flips, and the cars would regain their composition and stay in the same place for u to hit them in the next lap. hopfully need for speed underground 2 will fix these problems along with getting a shorter name, making it the single best game i would ever play."
5,"IF YOU DONT BUY THIS, YOU SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!",i played this at my friends house and couldnt put it down(my friend got mad at me:( ) the graphics are great and i cant wait to buy it!!!!PLUS IT IS NOT BORING AS SOME PEOPLE SAY.THATS A MYTH!!!!!!(MYTH)And they have racing chicks!!!!!!
4,great single player game,this is one of the most fun racing games after gran turismo. the graphics are cool and the street racing concept is fun. the main reason i bought this game was because it is online playable. but the thing is online play sucks in this game. first of all finding someone to race takes a zillion years...seriously. and when you finally find a race you can join...the max number of racers are 4 which is one of the reasons why onine play is so frustrating on this game. but if online play isn't necessarily your thing....this is a great single player game. go for it.
4,worth ever penny in my opinion,I have had this game since the first day it came out and i love it i play it all the time. You start off with a crappy car and u win races to get money and use the money to hook up your car. If you are really good you get good rankins and get in lots of magazines.good things areStory modegood carsnoshook up your cardrag racingsprintcircuit racinglap nock outdriftand many moreBad thingsNo copscomputer is hardwhen u spin out it takes a while to get back at good speedlots of sharp turnsOveral this game is still awesome and i reckamended to anybody who likes racing games.
3,Not that great,When i first saw this game i thought it would be awesome. Then i played a demo and fell in love. But then the game came out. my stepbrother bought and we played it for a long time. the only problem is that we realized that there are not that many tracks and they soon became repetitive. Sure the sense of speed is amazing and the graphics are great but it lacks something. Mabye its the free roam or only 20 cars. The music is not that great also. At first its fun but soon becomes boring. i recommend tokyo extreme racer 3 instead.
5,Love these bears!,My mom read these books to me when I was growing up and I loved these books! I know read these same books to my son and he love them too!
3,bear review,My daughter loved the story but I was disappointed that I could not make the dialog larger. It was slightly difficult to read.
5,"son loves it, long past halloween","We enjoy most of the Berenstain bear books and this was no exception. We read this before Halloween so my son who was just over 3 at the time, could get a sense of what he'd do when trick or treating. He enjoys the book and we're still reading it in January!"
5,Newbie,A friend loaned me this book and I had to have it. Want to make a few of the projects... SOMEDAY!
4,Every girl is a solid 7 at least,"These are the best looking girls I've seen in this genre. The production quality is noticeably better than most films like this. The plot is laughable like you'd expect. If you're trying to decide on one of these to watch, this is definitely tops where it counts: quality of hotties. The scenes are tame. The eye candy is what you're here to see and there it doesn't disappoint."
5,Vey Nice,Movie was rented from downloads and did not have no problem with it the movie was very well in good taste and my wife liked it cause it was not porn and had a story to it.
1,ok,"boring, so boring, not worth for the money. If you expect more than soft core, than this is not it."
3,Movie,"This move was an ok movie, it was not the best movie I have ever seen and I probably will not see it again."
1,Reviews misrepresent both content and quality,"Not much of a story, unrealistic both sexually and professionally, poor production values, this is porn. Would not recommend or, further, would actively discourage others from viewing this ""movie."""
4,a must for construction,if you work construction this is a must. The only down side is when you wash them the buttons in the middle rip out.
4,Works great but it's laking one feature,"Bought this for an older IDE HDD and works just fine. Easy to assemble with virtually no instructions needed. When the unit is closed up, the front is open for access to the DVD, CD-ROM, etc.. The only thing I wish was included was a front panel for this opening when using a HDD. There's no way to ""close"" the unit and looks kind of jerry-rigged when placed on your desk, shelf or where ever. But it does what I wanted so can't complain."
5,Outstanding Product,"First off even with the free shipping option delivery was two days ahead of estimated delivery date. Installation of my drive into the enclosure was simple and easy. Windows xp recognized the tosiba dvd rw drive immediately.Unlike another review, Lightscribe worked flawlessly. I purchased this product continue using a drive I had purchesed for a desktop which finally died and was replaced by a notebook. I couldn't be happier."
4,Make that old IDE DVD writer partable.,"I'm being pretty had on this case ONLY for physical design.I believe it should have been designed to look best on its side, not standing vertical.Other than that, you couldn't ask for more. So simple that the docs are over kill.Even includes drivers for Win98. Who is using THAT today? Not even this hardcore OLD stick in the mud.An audio output jack is a nice touch, but who needs it? I do wish I did. I once had a CD drive that could double as a CD player if you had it in this case. Haven't seen that capability for some time.As I started out, only issue is that it should look like it was intended to lie flat and not stand vertically. A simple stand like iOmega's would work fine and the look would be better (IMHO).Otherwise, 5 stars hands down. Very simple and it just works. I think I will like all of Vantec's NexStar DX cases. Cooling fans, etc in the series. All the bells and whistles. VERY nice."
1,Lasted 40 days,"Worked fine when I first got it, the fan wasn't loud as other reviewers described and it was simple to put together. But the computer stopped recognizing the drive after 40 days, I swapped drives to ensure it wasn't the dvd-drive itself, but the enclosure wouldn't work with any drive I put in it. Unfortunately, it's so cheap, it's not even worth going to the manufacturer to warranty. Easier to pick up a new one (not a Nexstar). Unfortunately, I can't recommend the brand or drive because it didn't even last one year."
4,Basically good,I had fits with getting windows to ID this device at first (64-bit 7 home premium). I reset the jumper on the dvd-rw drive several times and then just removed the tab completely. It works now. Make sure your drive is set to CS or cable select.Vantec NexStar DX NST-530U2 5.25-Inch IDE to USB 2.0 Optical Drive External Enclosure (Black)
4,Vantec Nexstar,"It was a perfect fit for my 3.5"" hard drive. Wires were easy to connect. Turned it on and it worked great. Thanks to the reviews that I read on this product helped me decide to buy this enclosure."
1,dvi/vga cable,"this was exactly the cable i needed to connect a new monitor to my old mac. the dvi end required a special mac pin which was difficult to find. after exhaustive search at electronics stores with no luck, the apple store recommended this cable. the order was filled immediately, shipped and received days before the promised date. i will definitely use this vendor again."
3,"Probably works fine, but not for my application","I bought this cable in the hopes that I could use it with a remaining XP System that contained a VGA adapter, while attaching the DVI end to my IOGear DVI KVM. Unfortunately, it did not work out for me (no video). It could very well be the IOGear KVM instead of the cable since I have not got any other VGA -> DVI converter/cable to work on that KVM."
5,"Great dual 1/4"" cables","I DJ at a bar in town a few times a month and needed a left and right channel 1/4"" connection to reach from my mixer to their soundboard over a wall on the other side of the time. I got these for a good price and they make sound go from one end to the other. The seem pretty tough too, I just wrap them up and throw them in a bag with other cables and there's no damage after doing that a few times and even leaving them in there for a week. If you need a decently priced pair of 19.5 foot dual 1/4"" cables, get these."
4,A little powerhouse,"I am pleasantly surprised at how many drywall screws this lightweight little impact driver can drive before the battery gives out. It is a bit slow for real production drywall hanging, but for small jobs by us ""amateurs"" it works great."
5,Bosch Impact Driver,"This little giant is perfect for the average homeowner. Yes, it doesn't have the power of an 18 volt mega driver, but it's about one tenth the size and weight and it will drive just about anything up to and including 4 inch lag screws into spruce timbers. And the LD light is very handy. Buy the whole kit including the holster and get a DeWalt conversion chuck and you only need one tool around the house for drilling and screwing. The extra lithium battery in the kit charges fast enough so that you can work all day if you're so inclined."
2,shipment incomplete,"Of the two vols, only vol 1 was received. Very disappointed in the service. First time service has been anything but excellent."
2,Preferring Patton's UNcesured Papers,"It has material SELECTED in order that we, the future students of history,not have a clue as to what really happened during that historical period. The ""Selectivity""just accidently left out the period 1940-45. Can't let that information get out! Others may begin suspecting censureship elsewhere!"
3,TJ Rocks!,"Why oh why didn't this kid become the next big martial arts movie star? It's beyond me, but he clearly SHOULD have. I watched Magic Kid for the first time in 1999 and I absolutely loved it's simply themed premise and lighthearted plot. It was perfect for what it was: a movie about a kid who happens to be a black belt fighter with moves to baffle everyone around him. Though this movie doesn't show his true talent to the degree that A Dangerous Place does, it is a movie with a lot of heart and just-sit-with-the-kids-on-a-saturday-afternoon-and-enjoy a better-movie-than-the-traditional-kids-section-fodder kind of mentality to it. If you want an intricate story, look elsewhere, but if you want to see a boy with some true talent in a movie that doesn't insult kids' intelligence, see Magic Kid. 3.75 stars"
5,The boys love it,I got this movie for a boy's birthday and they just run on and on about it. They loved it. I doubt if I would but I'm old.
2,Nice set but awful linens and the duvet is too thin,"Positive comment first - It was great to buy these sets and not have to individually purchase all items. It saved me a lot of time. Pillows, pillow covers and mattress toppers are perfect!On to the negative - the sheets however are of a really poor quality. They are thin and after only one wash they have already started to fray and there are even holes in the stitching of the fitted sheets. They also wrinkle really badly. The duvet is also thin and too small for the PINZON flannel duvet covers I bought."
4,Great buy few problems,"I love this set, it's an amazing deal and very soft and plush. The only complaint I have is that the fitted sheet is seamed and the seams are fraying a teeny bit after about 5 washes. Still one of the best buys I've ever come across. pinzon is incredible!!! thanks amazon."
5,Fabulous deal!,"I just bought this and put it on my bed- first the mattress cover is the best ever with huge pockets to keep it from falling off the mattress. The pillowcase and covers are very =nice, although I would suggest washing before use to rid of the new smell. I am very impressed with the set and had purchased 3 more sets for the kids when it was a gold box deal. I would definitely recommend."
2,Not standard size,"I'm sorry I bought this jigger. I should have read the product description a little more carefully, because I didn't realize that although it claims to be a jigger it only measures out 1 1/4 oz. Standard jiggers are 1 1/2 oz. I replaced it with a OXO, which is good but has to be filled to the brim to get the full 1 1/2 oz. But it also has markings for 1/2 oz and 1 oz. So it's not perfect, but better."
5,LOVE these shoes,I absolutely LOVE these shoes. I wish you went deeper in sizing because I have two family members who wear my same size who would buy these in a heart beat. But you only carried one in that size.
3,"Good, but thin material","I ordered this costume for my 7 year old daughter. It is good for the price, but please be aware the material is very thin and see-through. We had to get tights and a white t-shirt to wear underneath, which added to the price for us.Pros: Good price, washes well, accessories are softCons: See-through, requires undergarments"
4,Inidan Princess costume,"This product was a nice costume for both my girls. They really did love it, although you might need to wear tights underneath."
4,Outstanding account of SEAL/UDT training and Vietnam Ops,I read this book years ago when I was a Private in the Marine Corps. I was at a layover flight to my first duty station and picked up this book from the airport bookstore. I couldn't put it down and naturally finished it before I arrived in Okinawa. Jerry was a SEAL officer and the story depicts his exploits as a SEAL Team Leader. It details SEAL training and the SEAL Team camaraderie. This book was more than outstanding!!
5,Cushion,This air pillow is great for a wheelchair. Cushioning is great & it is very comfortable to use. Would purchase again if needed.
4,Makes extended wheelchair time more comfortable.,I Purchased this for a family member this Christmas. My main goal was to make extended time spent sitting in the wheel chair more comfortable. After about a weeks use my family member was very happy with the gift and said it made sitting more comfortable and didn't even notice discomfort after a few hours in it. Previously they has just been using 3-4 standard foam cushions. I replaced the top foam cushion with this Roho Cushion.The only downside is that the flexibility of the inflated cushion did make sliding into the wheelchair a little more difficult.
5,It's a cushion and does exactly what it is supposed to.,"I use this particular cushion in my car to give me a little extra padding. It makes long car trips much more pleasant. All the Roho cushions are pricey, but if you're looking for a little more comfort when you're sitting this may be the trick."
2,Bush Pigs,"I tried this out for giggle and while it provided some low brow entertainment I think I've now seen enough of this genre. Seventies hillbilly soft porn sort of sums it up. The women folk in the movies are somewhat homely (hence the title of this review) but the men are downright ugly - not that that matters I suppose. Still if you like your women well stacked and you can't concentrate on plot development for more than 20 seconds, this might be the movie for you."
5,great teaching tool!,"As a kindergarten teacher, I discovered this book to use in my math lesson for teaching the concept of ""half"". Every time I use this book, the children have a good understanding of what ""half"" is by the time the reading is finished. A great story with a cozy family and a great teaching tool!"
5,This ones a keeper!,"Starts with aerobic segment with moves that are easy to catch on to and fun to do. Next moves on to challenging abdominal exercises with some innovative moves. Has a special bonus Tai Chi Energizer segment, post-workout, to calm your mind and reduce muscle tension. This video is 53 minutes, but seems shorter, as you are not bored or wishing for it to be over."
3,bought this on accident,I misunderstood the purpose of this cable. I was looking for a y-jack to permit 2 guitars to be plugged into one amp. This cable won't do that but you probably already knew it! So I guess I cannot comment on whether it does what its designed to do.
3,Unfortunatly not usuable,"Maybe this is dumb luck, but when I use the cable I pick up a radio station, specifically 102.7 in Johnson City TN which makes the cable not usuable. I haven't used it outside my area but I assuming that it is just a really poorly insulated/shielded cable. Which for the price, I should have assumed.UPDATE: I moved to a new town and I don't pick up any radio signals, so I bumped it up a star."
2,Err...,Le sigh. Not the Octopus Project's best but I can only point the finger at Black Moth Super Rainbow who are actually the ones to blame. I can say this because this is actually their album and they only had some collaborative help from Octopus Project. So essentially this album is bad because it is by Black Moth. Plain and simple.
3,Beware of picture,"I purchased this for my wife and she did not like it that much. The picture that is listed doesn't do the bag any true justice. The bag is a real DEEP cream color, and I mean DEEP!!! The Moto Q that she has was covered, but the top edge did reach the top of this carrying case. It's not that bad, but it wasn't for my wife."
3,Durable,"This carry case is strong and durable. I really like the canvas material. I thought it was bigger though, but it still serves its purpose."
1,Didn't work,Tripp Lite recommends this adaptor. I know you can't always bat 100%. But It didn't work for my application; DVI KVM. I had to upgraded the video card to get the KVM to work.
1,didn't work,"I was using this to connect an Apple Cinema Display (DVI) to a laptop with only a VGA output. It never worked. I even tried a different DVI LCD monitor and other laptops and PCs and couldn't get this to work. I could tell power was passing through, but no video.I ended up returning this item."
3,Note-worthy but nothing new,"This DVD is good on a base level. On one hand, Kaufman does his usual routines we've seen in numerous videos (mighty mouse, wrestling women, etc.) and on the other hand this DVD features a GREAT interview with the REAL Andy where he's just being himself, not putting on any gimmics or hoaxes. This is the only tape/DVD where you actually get to see a glimpse of the man behind the wild hoaxes. The only problem is Seth Schutlz (Andy's friend and creator of this DVD) constantly buzzing in, sometimes right in the middle of an Andy routine which makes it frustrating. And during the wonderful interview. If you're gonna feature something new and original, don't spoil it!This is good for any Kaufman fan for the interview alone, but other then that, the routines we've seen over and over make this tape nothing special."
2,"great potential, poor execution","this dvd could have been great. the concert footage is rough but clear enough, and the backstage interview is pretty funny. what kills it, though, are the constant interruptions by some jackass sitting in his backyard telling us why andy kaufman is funny. if you are into andy kaufman enough to buy what you think is gonna be an entire concert of his from his prime, you don't need someone to explain the humor. if you do buy this, get it used and get ready to do some fast forwarding."
1,The Toy was dirty,This product was dirty when I got it. The product was not even properly packaged. I will now need to wash the toy first. I will not allow my pup to play with the toy...Waste of money!
3,A few diamonds among the rough,"I had seen this book at the library, and being a fan of Dante's Inferno, I checked it out. I was a bit disconcerted when I realized not all the stories take place in or near Hell, as the title suggests. Most of them occur here on Earth, where the characters are in a metaphorical hell. Surprise! Only a handful of the stories are worthy of note, including Gene Wolfe's and James Longrove's. The stories take place either in Hell, Chicago, or London. I found this last fact sometimes discouraging--i.e., I ended up skimming the story.I recommend you get this book from the library before you spend the cash at a store."
4,Best for a very young child when a sibling dies,"I found the book to be very good for a young child facing the confusion of the death of a sibling. I especially like that it deals with subjects in an easy to understand, yet gentle tone. It describes some difficult fears and emotions ... like the child's fear that the death was his fault, like the fear and confusion the child has over seeing his parents cry and grieve, and like the simple statement about changes in the family home as time goes on, while Jess is never forgotten.I have just one complaint about this book ... the last page says, ""Mommy says we will all miss Jess for a long time ..."" I wish they had said ""we will always miss Jess ..."" I think that is a more accurate portrayal of loss of someone in your immediate family."
1,I don't get it,"I just got this program today, and have only had a few hours to figure it out, but I just don't get it. I consider myself pretty computer savy, and was hoping for something sort of similar to imovie. First off, this thing didn't come with an instruction book. (was it supposed to?) Second, the help part wasn't helpful at all. I was able to create a title, but wasn't able to see what it looks like with the video. When I finally saved a video, all that played when I clicked on it was the sound. I will continue to look on-line for some info on how to work this thing, but so far I am extremely unhappy. The only good thing about it was that it was easy to install, and as far as I can tell, my computer isn't full of crazy worms and viruses caused by the program."
3,Solid or Stranded?,"Is this plug for solid or stranded cable, or both? No knowledgeable person can order this when you don't bother to provide critical details."
2,Tagalong,"This is the story of a middle child- with an older and younger brother.He is too little to play with the boys in his neighborhoood so his mother lets him go around the block....quite strange....and the author uses words like ""scornfully"" which is a large word for this audience.....The boy finally makes friends his own size...and wins all the games.Not sure it's the most positive message. Then, his younger brother becomes the new ""tagalong"" Maybe a good book for a middle child....otherwise....pass it by."
4,Louis The Fish,This book is about a man who is brought up surrounded by meat and he hated it. He would always get meat for his birthdays. Then he got a job cleaning out fish tanks at the doctor's office. He would spend hours looking at the fish. Then at the dinner table one day his Louis's mother said that he should get a job at the meat shop. So the next day after school Louis started working at the store. His father told him that one day the store would be his. His parents died shortly after. Louis spent his days working at the shop. He was so unhappy; his only time happy was when he would draw fish in the refrigerator. Then all the sudden Louis started to feel sick and then he started to see people as fish. One night he had an awful nightmare. He dreamed that he was attacked by meat. When he woke up he found out that he had turned into a fish. On his way to work Al who owned the pet store saw him and invited him to his store to stay in a tank. From that day on he lived happily ever after
5,the first review from someone who HAS the game,"i just picked this up at gamestop a few hours ago. i'm not going to launch into some insanely huge review, however i do want to say that the xbox version is just awesome. the graphics look amazing. the sounds are very realistic, and the cars handle very well. there are so many upgrades available for the cars, including turbos, nitrous, wheels, and A TON more. this game is so much better than older need for speed games! if you're at all interested in this sort of thing, absolutely get the game."
3,Interesting take on arcade style racer,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the depth that this game has to offer. The arcade style racer has always been a rather safe venue for publishers, but the creative lighting and style of this game make it stand out. This is not a new title by any means, but is well worth the reduced price. The games is deep enough to keep you entertained for hours and doesn't seem to stale as quickly as other arcade racer titles."
3,A great driving game in first person view,The game is pretty good. The drag racing is excellent. The grafics are very good also but when you have another player play they suffer a little. In the drag races the rpm gage moves from the right of the screen to the bottom and changes apperience which sucks and when you hit the nos button on any stage you don't get the same visual effect as you do when you play alone. After beating the game there really nothing left to do. I wish they would let you roam around anywhere with no boundaries. Really to be truthfull microsoft needs to contact me so we can get some real real real good games out there I know will be very big hits and one even past HALO and HALO2. Believe me its true
2,No need for this,"The graphics are decent but gameplay could use some more fine tuning. The driving is detached and the controls too sensitive. The cops don't do much other than slow down gameplay. Like another reviewer mentioned, it always feels like the same road. Project Gotham 2 gives you a more realistic driving experience and much better vehicle dynamics."
4,Not As Bad As You Think...,This CD is much better than his last CD The Emcee's Properganda. The beats are better but not as good as his first CD. He seems to be in more control of his career this time around and that means that all the songs are a little complain-y. He still does have alot of talent. too bad the variety is not as good this time around.
5,Nice songs,"The songs are great , especially F.Y.I & Politics as Usual, I am happy to have this CD :D"
1,Please don't buy from this artist,"I am a student from the University of Minnesota's Asian-American Student Union. We jumped on the chance to book Jin--a rising star in the American music industry where Asians are essentially unrepresented--for the feature of our annual spring conference and Asian Heritage Month. Unfortunately, Jin did NOT show up, NOR did he refund our money. Through months and months of continuing effort, we have attained sparse contact with Jin and his manager Kamel in which they promise the money but have not seen any of the $4000.00 to this day. As students, it will be difficult for us to find the time and money to file a suit, so in protest, please do not support this artist who is unwilling to repay us students."
3,I agree with the realy weird comments of the other reviewer,This DVD does look like it is thrown together with previous footage shot. Most of the scenes the women do seem very detached and confused about what is expected of them. I expected a much hotter DVD with sizziling action. Playboy put out a much better DVD with Kitana Baker and Sinema Films also has a hot amateur video called 'America's Wildest Bachelor Parties' that delivers sizzle. This DVD just didn't make it.
5,bedding,loved these sheets too much. wore them out. wish I could find them again. a great purchase. color was awesome too. pretty design.
4,New Multistand Not the Same,"Ugh... I have two multistands. The first was made in Australia and I was so impressed with this tool that I recently bought a second. Unfortunately, since my first purchase six months ago, the multistand is now made in China. The quality is not the same. While the old stand feels like MIL-SPEC, the new stand has play in the collar and the retracted height is not the same as the first, meaning that I have to use a level to get them even.I'll probably return the second purchase and hope that Triton reconsiders. It is unfortunate because the quality of the original was top notch - like the other reviewers note. Hopefully, I can find an older multistand made in Australia.5 stars to the original Aussie stand, 3 stars to the new PRC stand = 4 stars."
4,great stand with a little improvement,"This is a solid stand that performs well, but could be better if the height was increased: Although the legs do not lock at various angles, they can be made tight enough so you can set them at various angles to increase the advertised height, but be careful. The other minor con was assembly. Inserting the jaws into the stand proved difficult because of the screws: They did not easily go into the holes."
5,Gets to the heart of good writing,"There are many books that try to teach people to write better. This one cuts thru the junk and gets to the heart of it, for people who care what they write about."
2,college text,"Got this book for my college fine arts class.Honestly, I absolutly hated it. It is very unorganized, and hard to find things quickly. The index is horrible and incomplete. Also, the color plates in the book are not high qualtiy and they don't tell the sizes of the paintings! The picture in the book could be 5 inches long, but the painting is 20 feet high- I think it is important for it to give the reader that information.The only reason I am not giving it 1 star is because it really has alot of good information in it- it is just organized horribly."
1,Atrocious textbook,"This is the worst textbook I've ever been forced to use. I'm very thankful that my class was only 6 weeks and that my used copy of the book had all the most important info highlighted so I could skim instead of reading most of it.Not only does the book make many factual and grammatical mistakes, it is extremely biased and leaves out a lot of stuff. Their coverage of ""love"" was absolutely nauseating. When the authors bother to mention anyone besides heterosexual white men, they are categorized and defined by their minority status rather than their contributions to culture/society/art/etc. Anything not Western European or American is barely mentioned and treated as very foreign-wait, isn't their point that all humanity is alike??A more appropriate title would be ""Our Opinions of the Highlights of Modern Western Civilization: Now with even more mistakes!"""
2,Inaccurate info all over the place,"I had to have this book for my Social Science class. The Humanities topics are a mess with actual errors in there Judeo-Christian sections. They got the hierarchical from Abraham to Joseph wrong and inserted their personal beliefs whenever they could, refuting Christianity, but not Islam and seeming to prefer New Age thought. Yes, I am a Christian, but I respect others' right to their own faith and did not appreciate the errors/judgments in a text book! It's supposed to be factual and objective not opinionated and subjective. The only thing it was good for (the book) was to pass my class and learn how some people can slant their views and insert their bias. Not well done."
1,This Book Is Lousy,"This book contains all sorts of false misinformation. At one point it says:""The doctrine of the Trinity was hotly debated until 325 C.E. with the conclusion of the Council of Nicaea. Ultimately, the Catholic Church adopted the belief that Jesus was both Father and Son, as well as a spiritual being they called the Holy Ghost.""Any Christian know that is a blatant lie. Nobody should ever buy this book. It is garbage."
2,Returned,"The book was a week later than the date said on Amazon. It was not in the condition the seller said it was. The money was taken from my account the very same day that I ordered it but when I returned it, it took almost a month for the money to be returned. When trying to contact the seller I was disconnected several times and never received any email replies."
1,Art of Being Human,The book was listed as in good condition but it was not. I would rate the book as poor at best. The margins were written in and underlining through out. I was not happy with the purchase.
1,The Art of Being Human,I did not receive this book. I received something different. The ISBN # is 0-536-25936-4. This is the wrong book. I needed the one that is displayed on the website. The one I received is taken from the 8th edition. I really did not want to rate a product I didn't receive.
1,What review?,The supposed review that is on the web site is about half a sentence long. There is no way to see the rest of the review. You need to fix your web site.
4,One of the two books you should have on this campaign,"Castel writes a well researched and thorough campaign review.I have been told, however, that Castel wrote this book without touring the battlefield sites. How anyone can write such an extensive account and not have the passion to see the actual battlefields, where they still exist, is beyond my comprehension.The other book that I found a perfect compliment, especially a result of its EXCELLENT maps of regimental detail, is William Scaife's ""Atlanta Campaign"". These two books together will satisfy any student of the campaign."
3,"General Info, maybe too general...","The author obviously knows the subject matter. He seeks to write a very basic, general manual on beginning bodybuilding. The setup is very easy to follow, with chapters each discussing a different topic and seldom exceeding more than two pages. His best chapters are the ones on Creatine and other supplements, since this is his area of expertise.However, if you are beyond the basics, you may be disappointed by this book. It will not teach you individual exercises or techniques. It will also not give you workout routines. This is simply a book covering the very elementary basics of bodybuilding (such as ""do not overtrain"" and ""eat right"")."
5,Positively Perfect!,"Anyone with a horse should read this book.Kelly Marks builds on her excellent first book, ""Perfect Manners"" and has written the amazing guide to getting that special partnership with your equine.Easy to read chapters on how to choose which horse to buy, develop your ground and ridden training techniques, how to handle common remedial issues and how to gain a deeper understanding of the horse psyche should excel this book into being one of the definitive horsepersons bibles for 21st Century."
3,"Good book, but I liked the prequel better...","This is the follow-up book to Kelly Marks' ""Teach Your Horse Perfect Manners"" (which I also reviewed). While this book contained very useful information on dealing with more drastic equine behaviors like rearing, bucking, bolting, etc., for someone just looking to strengthen their relationship with their horse I'm not sure this is the one to read. ""Teach Your Horse..."" would be a better option for this purpose. It is still worth a read, it's just not the first book of Kelly Marks' that I'd recommend."
4,Excellent,"This is by far my favorite lotion for one because of the way it makes my skin feel and two because of the fresh scent. If you use it as a full body lotion, others close to you are likely to smell it so if you work closely with people who are extremely sensitive to scents, use caution. If you use it for face and hands like I do, it shouldn't be an issue. The scent is natural and is similar to fresh baked cookies, or a bakery."
4,Shea Butter Body Cream by Tree Hut,A very rich and creamy moisturizer with a tropical scent. Excellent on super dry skin.
3,"Very nice and effective moisturer, but the scent is quite strong","This works very well for moisturizing very dry skin. It's not at all greasy.The scent is very pleasant, but unfortunately, it's quite strong and persistent. It actually smells so nice that it almost makes me crave sweets. I applied it an hour or so before bedtime and for the week I used it, the scent completely permeated my room and a lot of my clothing.I recommend the pure shea butter by De-luxe which has a far milder scent."
4,A fabulous experiment...,"Joseph McElroy, who claims with this book an attempt to write shorter books for a reading public with less time on their hands, has written in ""Plus"" an incredibly ambitious and experimental novel. He does no less than discuss the emergence of consciousness; he attempts to explain, or at least propose, the first instances of conscious intelligence. If he has, as suggested, reduced the size of the novel, he has in turn increased its complexity and density.""Plus"" is by no means an easy novel to read. In fact, it challenges the reader at every turn. However, to read it through, to contemplate its implications, and to finally understand it, is to take part in its achievement."
5,"All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology","All Killer, No Filler: The Anthology is an amazing collection that was released 1994 and contains 42 songs that are from the mid 1950's to the 1980's. Jimmy Guterman wrote the linernotes and along with many fine pictures and a personel list for every single track. Here we get amazing tracks as ""Whole lot of shakin' going on"", ""Great Balls of fire"" and so many more. 5/5."
2,hard for me to get through,I really enjoy christian theology but this book just didn't grab me. The information is great and that is exactally what the book is for. If you're looking for something to read for pleasure this is not your book. But if you're doing research you should definately check this out. Just don't read it when you're tierd.
4,Strictly for Antlovers- visually fun,This video is strictly the music videos that made Adam Ant so much fun. Bawdy and brilliant he certainly knows how to dress-up and camp-up. I myself am a huge fan and I recommend this video to any Antlover wishing to have these rarely seen videos for their collection.
4,A good video hits anthology!!,"As an early fan of Adam Ant during the early MTV days and most of the eighties, it covers most of the hits from the albums ""Kings of the Wild Frontier"", ""Prince Charming"", ""Friend or Foe"", ""Strip""and ""Vive Le Rock"". All in all it is a collection of his more commercial success that should satisfy most peoples curiosity for those who did not grow listening to Adam Ant. And for long time fans it should satisfy those nostagic of his early MTV days. And hopefully we will hear new material in the future."
4,One of a Kind,"Here are all the hits from that singular sensation, Adam Ant. These songs are strange and over and the top just like the artist. At the very least, the existence of the song Beat My Guest (best song title ever?) deserves your dinero."
5,It's HUGEEEEE,"This thing is HUGE! I got fast and in time for the Superbowl. Thought the kids would use it, but all my adult guests hopped on it instead...I have fallen asleep on it a few times now and woke up with better sleep than on my bed! Pros=Nice big size decent price, looks like improvements have been made to the seems from earlier reviews, looks a little better made..time will tell...Cons=Be ready for it to take up some major space, I knew it was going to be big, but it really expands and spreads out."
1,expensive let down,"if you're looking for a huge quality bean bag chair. this isn't it. product was defective it was like a smelly half full futon cover full of those styofoam chunks you find in a gymnastic pit. why they charge 150 dollars for this thing, i don't know. but once it comes out of the square little box they send it in, it blows up HUGE. which entirely made it really difficult for me to return, amazon had to find a special carrier to come pick it up which ate up about 1 weeks - 1 1/2 weeks, i would give 1 star to the seller and 5 to amazon for making sure i was able to return this thing, i should be getting my refund in the next couple days. DO NOT BUY THIS. RESEMBLES NOTHING OUT OF THE PICTURE."
4,Is well suited to my needs,"I bought this specifically for lounging on in my office. The size is optimal, taking up somewhat less floorspace than a small loveseat would, and large enough for two people to snuggle on. The filling is not traditional bean bag beads, and can feel a bit lumpy, but it has a much more stable and enveloping feel. It has become less lumpy feeling over the week i've used it. I use this for writing, reading, and napping, and have had no problems or discomfort at all in any position.I am not crazy about the non-removable cover, but I keep a blanket on it anyway so it's not a major issue. It seems to be soundly constructed, though I would like to see sturdier stitching on the seams. I don't know how it would hold up to kids jumping on it - I imagine not well. Overall I recommend it for someone who is looking for a moderate-use chair alternative."
5,better than beans,"First of all, why are there people whining about this. The fact that it uses foam bits instead of beans makes it even more comfortable. I'm over six feet tall and this is more comfortable than most couches. awesome lounging item."
1,Flat and smelly,"My butt hits the floor no matter how I fluff it. I do not think they put enough stuffing in my chair. It also smells like mildewed towels. I am very disappointed after spending more than a hundred dollars on this. I have elected to return it, but how am I supposed to get this huge thing back in a box? THIS IS A RIP OFF. I have had several 'love sac' items and have never had this much trouble and was always happy."
4,HUGE,"Comes compacted in a small box; it takes a long time to pull apart. There were two guys kicking, pulling and tossing for 45 minutes. It left a mess to vaccum but since it has been all fluffed out there have not been any problems. It is a great chair for the area of our den that is uneven in surface."
4,works for the space...,needs to be rolled once in a while... but is durable... comfortable and definitely worth the $. Might even get another 1 or n3 for my kids!
5,A compelling narrative,"I love this book. Its core is a riveting spiritual biography of a single modern Thai nun, but the focus of the book gradually widens to include other nuns and then the situation of nuns in Thailand generally. Thematically, it is strikingly similar to Sallie King's Journey in Search of the Way, despite the obvious difference that the latter is a translation of and commentary on a spiritual autobiography. The sameness is that they are both vivid accounts of modern Asian women undergoing profound spiritual experience that take them into the territorial preserves of patriarchal Buddhist institutions. I don't know Sid Brown, but she can count me as a fan."
1,Hunk of Junk,"I won't buy this hunk of plastic because Atlantic should release these 3 fantastic cd's in their entirety. Roy's greatest body of work came from these masterpieces (A Street Called Straight, Loading Zone, & You're Not Alone) and I have them all on vinyl. If they ever release the cd's definately get them, but not this... please!"
5,Earthbath is Wonderful!,"What great products Earthbath carries. My dog has extremely sensitive skin and also suffers from food allergies. Earthbath products are terrific. They smell great and keep my dog's coat soft and her skin does not get dried out from it. That is a win-win situation for me! Try Earthbath products, I bet you won't be disappointed."
2,drying,found this to be rather drying and the scent isnt great.Iwas hoping the green tea scent would come thru more.used it once and wont again.
4,Good Product,"I like the smell. It's a nice, natural product that I use on my dogs when I can tell they are itching a bit. Since they are bathed weekly, it seems to keep their fur soft and smelling nice."
2,really?,"I purchased this after all t he great reviews, this thing smells bad! I followed the instructions and nada! smells bad."
5,Great conditioner,Our dog has allergies so this and the earthbath shampoo are great for her since they smell fresh but are not scented and contain all natural ingredients. She is fluffy soft after her bath.
5,Leaves Fur Super Soft!,Our furbabies love Earthbath!! Especially our blue pit who has the worst dry/flaky skin but once we started using earthbath it completely cleared it up! I would recommend Earthbath to everyone! It smells great to!
3,A Children's Game,"Graphically, I really enjoyed the look of this game. It is vivid and colorful, and has cute looking anime style characters who are very friendly. Controls are very easy, and the danger from enemies is very low. It can be frustrating to find certain items in the world which are required to move the story forward as this game is quite linear. The combat difficulty is very easy, and I felt bored playing through the battles eventually. I would say that this game would be good for children, but they may become as frustrated as I was with the hunting and gathering of certain items. With a walkthrough or strategy guide, this game might be entertaining for children or those who are new to RPG and strategy games."
2,Disappointing!!!,Good storyline and soundToo much repetition going back and forth to the same areasProbably not buy another product from this software company!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,The manufacturer states that this product is good for gerbils. IT'S NOT. Read up on gerbil allergies and you will find out that they are almost always allergic to cedar and pine. What does the manufacturer make this product from? PINE. This is a horrendous thing to give to your pets!
3,So-So House For Small Pets,"My mice like this little house fine and everything but its main flaw is that is that the upstairs is very difficult to clean. They tend to drag bedding up there and its really a pain to dig it out of the tiny windows. On the other hand they like climbing in and on it, sitting on the roof and using the treat cup for a balcony. Just be aware that you'll have a heck of a time keeping it tidy."
1,T.R.A.S.H game!,"007 Agent Under Fire(AUF) is the 3rd Worse 007 game,along with 007 Tommorow Never Dies and Goldeneye:Rogue Agent,its so boring,the only good factor is the multiplayer which also gets boring as there are no bots!If you own a PS2 and want a decent Bond game go ahead and get Everything Or Nothing or From Russia With Love-none of the other games are good.If you just want a fun shooter game get BLACK,Half Life any MOH or COD game or wait for the new Urban Chaos game atleast they have some FUN gameplay.So this game sucks i rate it 1.3/10 HORRIBLE GAME."
3,Connoisseur's Guide?,"This is an interesting book with lots of pictures of cigars and how they are made. In fact the information on the process of manufacturing cigars is excellent.There is one glitch in this publication though. The section on the cigar brands is really not very good. It is a fact that Cuban cigars are notoriously difficult to research but when the brands are listed, with what cigars are made by that brand, this book loses its title of the Connoisseur's Guide. For example, in the listing for Hoyo de Monterrey (Cuban) the list is uncomprehensive and does not list the Epicure No 2 which is one of the brand's signature pieces.This is an interesting book but it is not a reference (not that it professes to be). The section on Cubans is wholely inadequate but on the other hand, if you live in the US, who cares?"
3,Designed for the very lean child,"These pants are well-made and cute, which a slight bootleg appearance. But they are designed for a lean child. I bought these pants for my sons for a trip to Ethiopia. I wanted light-weight cotton pants. My older son is 3 1/2, but quite tall. He fits in the size 6, but they are much too long. My 21-month old (who sits right at the 50% on the growth chart) fits great in the Size 4, but again they are too long. My children are not chubby at all, but they are also not skinny. As I sew, I will hem the pants myself, but I feel like the sizing is off. As these are unisex pants, perhaps they are more true to size for a girl?"
5,Good selection of late '40s/early '50s material,"The period covered by this CD is a little strange; 1947 to 1950, so the earliest part of the fifties is included as well as most of the last half of the forties. But in fact, 1947 to 1957 was a unified period in popular music, so even if this collection doesn't mesh with the ""decades"" popular in classifying music, it's a reasonable period to cover. My own introduction to popular music came in 1948, so this CD contains many of the earliest memories I have of pop songs. This collection includes some of the best (even though a couple were already in my collection via other CDs I've ordered recently, but that's hard to avoid!)- every one of these a big hit in the 1947-1950 period that it covers.This is an excellent collection for people interested in the post-Big Band, pre-Rock'n'Roll era of music."
3,a expensive koi book,a little outdated and the price is high. There are a lot more new cheaper complete koi books. A good for collection purpuses.
2,The Complete Poetical Works of Oliver Wendell Holmes,"Very simple: the print is not clear....some of the letters in the words are not completely ""inked""...maybe the publisher thought this was more ""historical"" but it is a major distraction and if I had sent the book before I bought it, I wouldn't have."
3,The e-book has yet to master poetry,Unfortunately the ebook and poetry have not figured one another out. This version of Holme's poems is a mess when it comes to line breaks and that is awful. The words are here but not in their poetic form...it's better than nothing and it costs you nothing.
5,No Rat Terrier Family should be without this book!,"I've read this book from cover to cover several times. I laugh at the antics of RT's and their owners, I grieve for those who shared their losses, I try the recipes out for curiosity and I commend Anne Blair on a great job. May she keep writing about Rat Terriers and their families. Thank you Anne. Your book is my favorite book to read just before bedtime when I snuggle up with my Rat Terriers. I can't think of a better book to help me have sweet dreams."
1,Blech blech blech,"Too slow and too simple. I bought this expecting interesting lyrics and lively folk styl music. All the songs are slow and meloncoly and he lyrics are simple and without much meaning. for comparison, I'm a big fan of Bob Dylan, John Prine, Jimmie Rodgers, and the faster andmore upbeat work of Guy Clark and Willie Nelson. If you're in sinc with these musical tastes, do not buy this CD."
2,Made in China,Made in China not Italy as posted. Save yourself $1 and order item B0002AKN28 as this is what is shipped anyway not the black one as pictured.For the price its the best foil cutter available.
2,Bad book on a great subject,"This book only rises to two stars because it quotes several whole dollops of the wonderful humorist's work. One must grudgingly admit that Altman manages to plod through the external events of his subject's lilfe, and as far as these are interesting (some are) the book is interesting. But Altman fails to analyse Benchley's work -- fails to connect his humor to events in his life or the work of other humorists and writers of the time. The book's early chapters are hopelessly bogged down in detail from Benchley's journals, only a few of which are either illuminating or interesting. The style throughout is pedestrian (except, of course, in the quotations.) A reader interested in Benchley would be far better advised to seek out the writings of the master himself."
5,A Lot More than expected,"Cd's arrived in great condition, packaged well, and fast shipping. Couldn't be happier with my purchase. This one was a whole lot more than expected. Thanks."
5,Excellent,"One of the best and easiest to read autobiographies I have ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially hockey fans. Sheldon Kennedy is very brave for Making his story public."
2,Not For Kindle,"This is an excellent book! But the illustrations are a big part of what makes it so good. They are too small for the standard kindle, even with the ""zoom"". I found myself using a magnifying glass to try to make out the writing in the pictures and it was still too small.Great book, get it in paperback."
5,Good tips and tricks!,Perfect for you who wanna go camping and dont know what you need or how to behave or even find yourself in the woods with an emergency.
5,"Easy Read, To the Point","I love this book. It only takes a few hours to read and basically summarizes everything you need to know. Most backpacking books are way too wordy. This book is illustrated, fun and gives you the information is digestible chunks, rather that wasting your time. Partner this book with Lighten Up by Don Ladigin and Mike Clelland (same illustrator). Honestly, unless you love to read or really need in depth knowledge on the subject, these books are all you need to read about backpacking."
4,Good ideas,"Reading this book reminds me that it's possible to learn from all types of backpackers. The book is well written and illustrated. The illustrations have ideas that are not always in the text.Allen O'Bannon clearly is not in the lightweight backpacking camp, which I am. O'Bannon writes about heavy pack loads (how to properly put on a heavy pack) and leather hiking boots. The book is loaded with ideas that will be interesting to all backpackers. I wouldn't recommend the book to someone just starting out with backpacking. For those readers I would give it just two stars. However, I would recommend it for a current backpacker that wants some fresh ideas or a fairly new backpacker that has read a couple books on lightweight backpacking first. The book isn't loaded with a lot of fluff that can be found everywhere. It is also easy to read and not nearly as boring as many backpacking books."
5,Backpackin' Book,"I loved this book! I look through it every time I'm planning a backpacking trip - just to make sure I've remembered everything and that my bag is optimally packed. Not only is it filled with great information, but it's a hoot to read - the illustrations crack me up!"
2,Pack Weight 40% of Your Body Weight?,"This book, excellent illustrations and explanations notwithstanding, is an outdoor dinosaur and should be extinct. Plenty of accessible equipment and techniques now allow backpackers to adjust their pack weights to suit the conditions present. This book presents ""mobile camping"" (carrying camp chairs, camp shoes, and ovens) and not ""backpacking"" where the goal is safe, comfortable travel through the wilderness carrying only what you need. This book should be relegated to the back of your gear closet. Check out Mike Clelland's other excellent books on lightweight backpacking and tell old skul NOLS advocates to go back to their rocking chairs (they're probably carrying them around in their packs right now, just in case!)."
5,Wonderful Moisturizer & Scent!,"This Tree Hut Body Cream in Brazilian Nut Scent is the best I've tried & I've tried many looking for something to moisturize & soothe my dry skin. This stuff works so good-my skin is so soft! I can't stop putting it on because it smells SO GOOD!!! The scent is unbelievable, definitely one of my favorites. I also have the Coconut Lime which I enjoy too, but the Brazilian Nut is just ""HEAVENLY!!"" YUMMMMMM! It smells good enough to eat, although I wouldn't advise it! :)"
5,The Greatest!,"It's all I could do to keep from wanting to spread this stuff on a piece of toast. It smell SO DARN GOOD that I put it on before I go to bed, so I can go to sleep smelling it. I have the Mango cream too, but the Nut Gream is the BEST! I think everyone should try this stuff!"
5,What dry skin?,"Iowa winds and temperature extremes do a number on my skin. I found this product by accident, when I discovered my boyfriend's house to be without moisturizer. It was on the bottom shelf at Wal-Mart and I picked it up because it was one of the few that listed Shea butter in the top three ingredients. I bought it because it smelled like caramel (which happens to be the last ingredient listed). Now I have pots stashed everywhere. It's a shea butter bargain, ringing up just over $5 with tax. It has a great heavy cream texture but body heat melts it almost instantly. Very little residue but an enduring fragrance. I put it on after my shower at 6AM and a co-worker commented on the yummy smell when I sat down next to her at 1:30PM."
5,It's back!!,"Yes!! Somebody at Tree Hut listened to all of us who were wailing at the loss of this product. The packaging is different (looks better), but the stuff inside is the same rich, heavenly-smelling, deeply-moisturising body butter we loved so much. My one caveat for this product is: If you find it somewhere, stock up. Even now it's in pretty short supply (or high demand). Thank you, Tree Hut!"
5,so great for problem skin,"I have also been using this skin cream for 2 years. I have severe problem skin, scaling skin and eczema when I use any product with synthetic fragrance. Nut butter literally makes my skin smooth and heals it while maintaining a moisturized level till the next time I shower (I can literally go days without dry skin)."
5,mmmm,this stuff is great!! the smell really does make you want to eat it....im flipping out b/c im scraping the jar as we speak!
5,Brilliant,I am extremely satisfied with your service. Everything delivered on time and I am looking forward to future volumes. Do you know when volume 5 is due to come out? I now have Vols. 1-4.
5,YES!!!,"FINALLY! It took Fox 3 years, but we will have Season 2 on DVD at the end of July. I agree with everyone who is appalled at the fact that crap TV shows like ""Alf"", ""Full House"" and stupid reality shows like ""Newlyweds"" are out on DVD, yet we are still waiting for MTM. I was blown away by the picture quality on Season 1, as well as the neat extras... I'm sure Season 2 will be just as fantastic. Hopefully with the lower price tag, more people will pick this up and Fox will get the rest of the seasons released ASAP. I'm crossing my fingers. This is my favorite TV show of all time - I have all the episodes on tape (taped them off Nick at Nite in the early '90s), but I must have all 168 episodes in all their digitally remastered glory!"
5,I Can't Believe It!,"Season 2 is finally being released. People at Fox have come to their senses. It's been almost three years since Season 1 was released. What the hell took so long? This was the best comedy series ever produced. No other TV series before it or since has come close to ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" Winner of 29 Emmy Awards in it's seven year run says it all. Sure, the show is a little dated by todays standards, but so what. Who could not love those characters? My favourites are bumbling Ted Baxter, sweet Georgette and acid-tongued Sue Ann.With so much garbage out on DVD now, and dumb stupid Reality shows on television, they're not much to watch.Please release the remaining seasons quickly (maybe every 3 months or so.) That would be great. Thanks Fox for getting your act together."
5,MTM 2nd season,I would HIGHLY recommend buying these DVD's! Its like visitng old friends again! Classic 1970's tv at its very best!!!! A MUST HAVE for any dvd collection!!!!!
5,Mary & Rhoda = BFF,I just love the dynamics in this season. Such rich passion for life and really portrays the city life for a woman in that time as you would envision it to have been.
5,A must have series!,"Well as a viewer from abroad -from Greece- and someone who couldn't have the chance to view the series when it was first shown on TV (I hadn't even born yet!!) I must say that I enjoyed the first season on DVD a lot and I couldn't wait until the second season -and all the rest- would be released! I would definetely buy it as soon as it is released, as I think that it's both funny and it represents its social environment, that is the 70's environment...Plus the picture quality of the first season was superb and I expect the same for the second season too!"
2,just so-so,"it had been a long time since the first season was released, so i guess i forgot how much of the show was based on her home life. while that was good to get you aquainted with Mary herself, i has hoped the second season would be more in the office, but it wasn't. it's still pretty much her home life. i wanted to see more behind the scenes in the newsroom. i hope future released seasons will be."
5,The Impossible Dream,"Thank God that Fox has gifted the world with another full season of one of the greatest television sitcoms ever created! It is absolutely incomprehensible to me that season after season of trash like ""Full House"" gets released but MTM collects dusts in vaults. Would also love to see ""Rhoda"" and ""Phyllis"" released, but know this is probably a long shot."
5,Bring On The Next 5 Seasons,"Once again there has been no advertising for this set, and if I had not ordered from Amazon I would have had a hard time finding it. What is up with Fox. Then they'll tell us season two didn't sell well enough to put out season three. If they were smart they would just get all seven seasons on DVD ASAP. Let us have season three in time for Christmas. Best sit-com ever"
2,Cheap earrings,"I definitely liked these earrings when I first purchased them as they are dangly but light. After a while, the sterling silver began to turn to an orange color since they are cheap earrings. I'm not too disappointed because they were relatively cheap when I purchased them, but now I can't use them anymore. Perhaps spending a few dollars more for better quality earrings would have been worth it."
3,More Polish-English than English-Polish,"This is a pretty comprehensive dictionary. It's been very useful to me in my study of Polish. Not only that, but it's pocket-size and has a durable cover, so it's easy to bring along on your travels to Poland or to class.The problem I have with this dictionary is that it's more of a dictionary for a Polish speaker, for English, than for an English speaker trying to speak Polish. While there are both English/Polish and Polish/English sections, the are only pronunciations for the English words, not the Polish ones. This, to me, was a major drawback. You can look up the Polish words, but there is no key to pronunciation. So, it's a good dictionary, but needs to be used in combination with something that will help you with pronunciation."
4,woah - travel size,"I didn't know until I got this but this dictionary is really pocket size (approx 8 x 10cm), which is very useful for travelling, but of course it also means that it is quite limited in terms of words. As someone who is going to study abroad in Poland I might end up carrying this around everyday but having to rely on a larger one when I need more specific volcabulary. For example, I couldn't find 'sprain' in there, and certainly not the more specific dance vocabulary (jete, yoga) that I will be using."
3,Just Okay,I was very happy to find this item at Amazon. The pet shops around here (north of Boston) don't seemto be able get them lately. This is my dog's favorite chew treat. The flossies I received were on thethin side. The ones at the pet shop from the same company were more substantial. I hope in the futurethey are more substantial.
3,not too thrilled this time. .,very flimsy and lots broke upon opening. not very big. some what disappointedwith these flossies!! Last time they weregreat and lasted
4,"Small, useful and as described!",I 've used this with Mac OS 10.2.8 and WinXP Pro - No problems. Notas solid as it could be but no less so than others.
2,You get what you pay for....,"This drive is supposed to work with Windows 98SE. I have spent at least an hour loading, unloading, and searching the WWW for a driver that will work. It doesn't work on my Dell laptop with Win 98SE. I tried contacting the ""Tech Support"" 3 times and never received a response. If you are buying to work on a Win 98 system, be careful. I can say that it does work on my WinXP system, but it appears to be very slow taking 29 minutes+ to copy 450 MB. Equal time to delete."
5,Intensity and Succes Superior to Golf Ball,"A week prior to purchasing this I had began to feel early PF symptoms. Where my arch near the join with my heel would get very tight if I was stationary for my more than twenty minutes. I would then have to walk it off. Immediately I began attempting to massage it out by rolling on a golf ball several times a day. This seemed to help, but still my symptoms continued to worsen. On a fluke I got the footweel as a gift and after the first time using it was amazed at how much more intensity and precision it has than a golf ball. My symptoms altogether disappeared in three days. Everyone is different but I would recommend trying the footweel to relieve PF, especially if you are not having success with less powerful massage aids.Also, the footweel doubles as the most powerful pressure IT-band massage I have been able to find. Makes foam rolling look like a cakewalk."
1,Not that impressed,"I was really hoping this would help with my plantar fasciitis, but I'm very disappointed with it. I'm a huge fan of The Stick, but this is not great. It actually hurt my feet even if I rolled them gently on it. I'm not sure if it's because I have small feet (women's size 6.5), but it doesn't feel good on my feet. I'm sticking to the golf ball for now."
3,A little hard to use.,"I am a running enthusiast. A physical therapists recommend this product to help me manage a recent flareup of plantar fasciitis. I bought the Foot Wheel and also another product called theFoot Rubz. The Foot Wheel is a little hard for me to use. As I move my foot up and down over the wheel, the wheel wants to veer left or right. I find it difficult to get it in just the right spot to work on a specific problem area of my foot. The Foot Rubz is way easier to use in this respect. I plan to buy a second Foot Rubz to keep at work."
1,This product is a triumph of marketing over usefulness.,"I am a professional manual therapist with over 20 years of experience with injury rehabilitation.Because of the design of this product, I find it nearly useless. It has three protruding rings that are spaced too far apart. So when you roll it under your foot, you get a line of pain in your sole, because the pressure is too focused. If the product was narrower, the pressure would be dispersed more effectively. Maybe if your feet are size 20 or larger, this product may work.You would be far better off buying a plastic spiky ball or yellow practice golf ball to roll out your soles. For working out specific areas of tension, go with the golf ball."
4,Royal Society,"Royal Society comes as a logical step in this band's progression. After blistering debut Horse of the Dog it was always going to be interesting to see how the group would follow up such a convincingly solid debut, never an easy task. The answer is a natural exploration of how the band could expand on their ""psychosis rock"" sound which is often with what seems a natural maturity and to great effect on songs like ""Rise of the Eagles"" and ""Mister Mental"" and at times a little forced and seemingly less focused on numbers like ""Puppy Dog Snails"" which clumsily trails through an awkward nursery rhyme style song almost parodying themselves in the process. For the few weaker moments though, and there is only a few, the album is a brilliant expansion of the ideas the Eighties' laid down on their debut. Top notch in fact."
4,Good starter for Anime,This is a good start for some Anime Starters. This is sort of like old school Japanese Anime. I bought it for price and I remember this series when I got into watching Anime.
5,Even better!!,"The first one was excellent but the second one is even better. Arc the lad just keeps getting better. In this one elk confronts arc but doen't do a very good job, I won't tell you any more because I'd ruin it.In some parts the people talk really fast like they're trying to sqeeze a bunch of stuff in one episode. It's actually kind of funny to watch.Well my point is , if you liked the first one you'll like the second one too."
4,"Slow paced, but must pe patient.","Again just like the first DVD volume, this contain only three episodes. Most likely because the entire series is mere 14 episoeds. In this volume, Elk meets Arc and more of Elk's past is uncover. There was not much figting scenes as hoped, but the story is progressing slowly. Not to spoil,but one could probably tell who the real villain is in the serie from this volume. I'm still looking for something that'll hype up this Anime, but none here. Hopefully, in the next volume the story will be more intense and more fighting action scenes. Just like the first volume, the extra consist of some previews and a ADV compilation. Overall, this volume is satisfactory. This serie needs to start a moving to the point."
4,definitely worth the money,"While the item is definitely a recycled wood rather than a solid wood bar, it is more than sturdy enough to handle the job. storage is nice, but could more shelving and the game tables are definitely worth the money paid for the item. only complaints i could possibly have for the product are that the wood split a bit when tightening down the torque screws and the top does not sit flush with wood side up because of the bumpers on the top and the bar. it bows a bit to the center, but really only noticeable when looking for it. the game tables are definitely decent quality, but a cheap roulette wheel is still a cheap roulette wheel. all in all a great item, and would definitely recommend it to someone considering the purchase."
4,Very nice unit,"This is a very nice unit with a substantial game table. The color is quite reddish which I was not expecting. The game table is great. However, the top is just set on the top, which isn't a problem for me but beware if you plan on using it mostly as a bar."
5,Still my favorite since 1957!,"The first record album that I ever bought was ""The Twang The Thang"" back in 1957 and I still enjoy it every now and then. Dwane Eddy's The ANTHOLOGY CD has all his hits plus many others.The sound quality and programing on this CD is second to none. I am very pleased with it. If you like Dwane Eddy, you owe yourself this CD. GOOD TWANGING."
4,Duane Eddy anthology,"Though rather overpriced, this was the only Eddy compendium that included all his major hit releases, at least to my knowledge. It was a ""Best of"" I had searched for for some time so the $30-plus price tag was worth it to me. Audio quality I suspect was as good as the original masters allowed. However, the engineers at the label obviously didn't leave much room for improvement. It was, in the day, AM radio quality. Not much to be improved upon. Liner notes were excellent."
4,there's just one thing,"Missing...Because They're Younghow can you put out a decent comprehensive Duane Eddy album without Because They're Young??? i'm off to iTunes to see if i can get it there.nice try, rhino."
3,Probably best for young or new students,"This log does not have enough space for the type of information I like to include in my practice log. It is really just a way to keep track of whether a student is practicing, how they feel about it and whether they are progressing. I like to write details regarding my practice plans for each piece I'm working on. I also write down exactly what I worked on, measures, tempos, repetitions, etc. I will use this book for a while and ammend my review if I feel differently about it later. But in general I don't think it is what I was looking for."
2,Not what I expected,Because I wanted to structure my drum lessons as a dedicated amateur with limited time I thought this book would be of great help. But actually it isn't a book at all. More of sheets with standard practice routine and some comments. So that is nog really a bargain for such price I think.
2,Something more is less!,"Rob Thomas is a talented artist whom I hope to see more of. Unfortunately In ""Something More"" he shows us mostly different renditions of the same songs he previously recorded. I won't toss the CD but it won't be on my favorites list. I'd like to see something more than this CD from him."
3,Enjoyable read,"""Kate Millbank's heart beat faster when she heard that Major David Merritt was returning from the wars. For she had worshipped David ever since they had been children together.But Kate was no longer a child. She was older now, and should have been wiser. She should have know that to long for this illegitimate son of a scandalous liaison was flirting with ruin. She should have realized that war had changed David into a bitter and angry stranger. She should have feared that love was making her blind to the folly of her feelings....Instead it only made her believe in miracles as she lost her heart to this man who no longer seemed to have one...""This book was kind of dark and at times tedious, though very interesting on the whole."
2,Roy deserved better,"I've bought many box sets over the years, but this one takes the cake for being the most disappointing. At the time of it's release I had managed to track down most everything on it through the compilations that were released to capitalize on Roy's death. I bought the box set sight unseen and couldn't believe how scanty it was when I got it home and opened it. It showed no advance thought or planning with a poorly done book and four discs with 50 minutes of music on each. Sony strikes again, or I should say, Sony strikes out. Like I said, Roy deserved better. Maybe if Sony had leased the rights to the music to Rhino justice would have been done."
2,"""What Happened""","I bought this Box Set used for 25 bucks and thought I got a good deal, what I got was taken.This collection gives the word sad to the whole ""BOX SET"" deal! Four CDs, what happened to top hits like ""Blue Angel""? Is this supposed to be an Orbison collection or Narvel Felts? I'm certain folks can follow what I'm trying to say without saying it ! ""ENJOY"""
3,Legendary Roy Orbison,"Only for the die hard Orbison fan, there are a lot of songs on this collection I had never heard of and were not very good. I bought it because it has a Bee Gees song on it that I could not find anywhere else.twin spin"
3,The Affair of the Pink Pearl (Unabridged),"This review is for the Unabridged Audio Cassette version of ""The Affair of the Pink Pearl."" It is very well written and narrated. True to form. The narrator plays the character parts very well. The flow of the story kept my interest and I didn't want to stop listening, but this is definiately a ""SHORT STORY""! It is ONE cassette only - 80 minutes and the original cost is $5.99. I believe Amazon is amiss in not listing a more accurate description of the audio cassette versions of books."
1,Not All Are Martyrs,"Dietrich Bonhoeffer was not a martyr, he was a political prisoner who was killed for his part in the plot to kill Hitler. A martyr is killed for being a Christian, not for planning to kill someone else. There are a few other people in this book who were not martyrs when they died. ""Martyr"" means ""witness,"" and to call someone who dies because he is caught plotting against another's life--despite how evil that other may be--is comparable to the ignorance behind calling animals of prey cannibals when they eat a human being. There's just no truth in a statement like that.Too, the ""let's make this book cool for the youth"" layout and title lessen the strength of an already insipid collection of stories. As far as I know, there are only two collections of martyr stories that are considered important: Foxe's Book of Martyrs, and Martyr's Mirror."
1,Major Disappointment,"I purchased this book after moving to the Gold Country. I was very disappointed with it, and consider it a waste of 13 bucks."
5,Great read.,"Conor, the eldest of 6 bought his brothers up after their mother left them with their dad. Years later while working, he is assigned to protecting Olivia, a witness in a trial. As the pair are chased by criminals out to kill them, they sucumb to their feelings. This is something Conor has never felt, not having had a female influence in his life.I can't wait to read the other brothers stories (Dylan, Brendan, Liam, Brian & Sean). They are a fantastic family."
3,Harrowing,"Billie Holliday is probably the most gifted and tragic heroine of her time. She overcame poverty racism and endless failed relationships to become one of the greatest jazz singers of the 20th century. She also paid the ultimate price as few singers before or after Lady Day, suffered her art the way she did.While critics may doubt the reliability of her memoirs ( some say she never even read the book, let alone had a hand in writing it).Her life is fully probed and documented and who really knows more about Billie than Billie ( although some parts are confused and contradictory. But this was very near the end of her life and is understandable).The book comes more highly recommended than the movie (It's all about Miss Ross).But if you really want to learn about Billie's real personal thoughts and feelings, just crank up your CD player and listen to that voice.It speaks volumes and from her heart. That tells you more than any written document ever will."
4,She sang what she felt,"Billie Holliday lived a sad and tortured life. She was always a victim. A victim of the racist times, the men, the music and everyone else who took advantage of her. Through it all she managed to sing and produce music that made so many people happy.The book is easy to read, but choppy at times. If you are looking for historical accuracy, look elsewhere. The ""fictionalized"" parts off her life do not detract from the story. She or William Dufty may have taken some liberties, but they are used to make a point. I strongly recommend this book to any Billie Holliday fan."
4,paperback book,"I love this book and the movie too! I'll say it was pretty worn, but still in good shape for such an old book. It came fairly quick."
5,"Wonderful Interaction, Fast Response","It was wonderful dealing with this book seller. I had questions and they were answered IMMEDIATELY which was very unexpected. then after purchase book was shipped promptly and arrived in record time. pleasure to do business with, I recommend! oh is this about the seller or the book? no need to review the book ,its BILLIE HOLIDAY!!! ITS GOLDEN this book! lol, goes without saying :)"
4,inaccurate but honest.,"I just finished reading this book and lstened to the 1956 recording of billie's concert at Carnagie hall. She i so honest about her drug use it breaks your heart, Oh, if only she had lived today maybe she woul dhave liked herslf more. I love Billie Holiday and you wil to after readign this book"
2,"decent enough, but....","I bought these (though not on Amazon) to help protect my feet from the elements while working outdoors in very rainy weather and on hard concrete surfaces, and coming into contact with severe solvents. They were comfortable enough, and great when passing through scanners and served their purpose well.... well, that is, until the back heel began to unstick after less than eight (8) months... I was really disappointed, cause they cost A LOT. If I could've given it a 2 1/2 star rating, I would've."
4,"Works as advertised, though not made in Italy","The strainer works as advertised but I am a little disappointed at the build quality. The wire mesh seems rather delicate and I have my doubts about how long it will last, though I can't really complain at this price. The product description is somewhat misleading in that it suggests the strainer is manufactured in Italy. Pedrini is indeed an Italian company, but this strainer is made in China."
3,Can't give it 5 Stars because now they're MADE IN CHINA,"I spent months trying to find a new strainer, because I loved my old ""Pedrini"" strainer that I got as a wedding gift. It was Made in Italy, I believe. Every store I went to only had strainers Made in China, so I ordered these from Amazon, assuming that they would be Made in Italy as my others were. Nope, they're Made in China!!! I am VERY disappointed in that, and highly disappointed with Amazon for not listing this type of information in product descriptions. If I went shopping at any store, I would be able to look at the packaging and determine where I product was made. The SAME information should be available in online product descriptions!"
1,Hole in the mesh,"This item had a small hole in the middle of the mesh which pretty much defeats the purpose of a strainer. Also, note that the mesh is not that fine. The description leads you to believe this is fine mesh and it is not. I returned this product effortlessly to Amazon and they refunded my money quickly."
5,Best KM primer I've read,"I read dozens of books and articles on knowledge management (KM) in preparation for a final MBA project, and this book excelled more than any other in providing a clear, concise summary of the subject matter. If I had to recommend only one book to a seeker of knowledge on KM, this book would be it."
5,Best of the bunch!,I ordered four books on the subject of Knowledge Management. One was thrown away. THIS ONE has become required reading in our department.
3,"Good Primer, Short on Technology and Case Studies","Thomas Davenport is a well know expert on the subject of Knowledge Management. His book, Working Knowledge, is a quick read excellent for passing time on an airplane or subway. Yet, it is a bit light on specific implementations of KM. In particular, it would have been nice to illustrate a case study or two. Given that his employer is Accenture, I would have expected a little more on the lifecycle of a KM implementation in a large corporation, even if it was at a high level.Unfortunately, the text is also fails to describe the rapidly evolving KM technology landscape. In the boom years of the late 1990's, significant activity in the development of corporate portals, eLearning, and adaptive technologies occurred. Davenport fails to recognize any of these factors in his discussion of KM."
1,"Lots of Info, little ""Knowledge"" and action","This book was a disappointment. It included lots of discussion on knowledge management, but had only a few, weak examples of success stories. This book offers no solutions to creating a knowledge sharing culture or improving knowledge sharing within an organization."
2,Style without substance or plot,"This is a film which is heavy on style but unfortunately has no substance whatsoever and only minimal vestiges of a plot (contract killer and prostitute go on the run through Chile pursued by a drug/art forgery ring, though why is never entirely clear). As such, it's not really a road movie or a gangster movie or a romance, just an opportunity for a few stylish French actors and actresses to stand around murmuring cod philosophy in tres chic clothing. Plus there's an appearance from the late Joe Strummer, who plays ""Vince Taylor"" (an obscure-yet-hip reference to the '60's rocker who wrote ""Brand New Cadillac"", which Strummer's band The Clash recorded a cover version of on ""London Calling"") and is onscreen for maybe 10 minutes max despite having fourth billing in the credits.In short, ""Doctor Chance"" is a film that thinks it's a lot cooler than it really is and isn't really worth 96 minutes of anyone's time. 2 stars for being stylish, 0 stars for the rest."
3,over priced item,was charged way too much for the item I love hosa cable but these companies jack up the price sell the items for 4 times what the price should be
1,"Really bad quality cables, not for professional use","I've used Hosa cables for a number of professional applications, specifically DJ'ing. I'm always extremely careful with my cables, and put them away tidily avoiding twisting, bending or applying extra pressure (which is the number one reason for damaged cables).Hosa cables were unreliable and they all stopped working after about 1 year of use. Every single one I've ever owned."
4,Ok,"Don't have any idea of why I choose this reating. There was no problem shipping, the package came without any tears or rips and the cables worked like they were supposed to."
3,I,I really had no need for this product but it was advertised and bundled in the product that I needed. I'm sorry I purchase it.
5,Great cables,I have several Hosa cables and not one single problem. These cables are high quality and the price can not be beat. No sense in paying three times as much for Monster Cable.
4,It works,Its a ok product. It works but the rca connectors are cheap. but they do what i need them to do.... gold plated tin... sry but it is what it is..... Knowing this i would have looked for a better cable. im starting a DJ business and i want a better product then this. (for longevity)i can see them wearing out prematurely.
5,still the same,"I enjoyed reading this book to my children 25 years ago. Now that they have their own children (...)and they have asked for it for their children. I am a bit jealous that they will get such a bigger book with more content, but thrilled that I can share this not only with my children but also with my grandchildren. It is a joy to find Bible-based ideas in our favorite nursery rhymes!!"
4,cool song,i did not know raven sang. in tell i got videonow xp and they had a raven disk. so i got it and it is great. raven music video backflip and let me tell you is a great dance song. i love it. wen i want to watch raven i just put in the disk and ravens backflip goes on.
2,Disappointing product,"Many of the cards were confusing. Cards easily bent, storage not great. No system to what is being presented and geo safari ""computer"" is difficult for little ones to use. The whole system was a real disappointment."
4,"Great educational value and fun, but relatively old technology","This product has a great educational value. The cards are great, I wish there was stuff like this when I was growing up. My five year old loves this. The technology is relatively old, given the more advanced products, CD-roms, etc on the market. The biggest strenght of this product is the educational cards that are designed by education professionals. Recommended."
3,FAIR RELEASE!!!!!,"This film deserves a much better release than this one from Ivy Video. The original title ""Last Outpost"" has been removed and replaced with ""Cavalry Charge"" for this re-release by another distributor. All references to Paramount Pictures have been removed. The quality starts out good, but then worsens with print damage and splices. This made it somewhat annoying to watch. Hard to recommend this edition."
4,Cavalry Charge,This first Western starring Ronald Reagan is loaded with Action and a fine cast. Rhonda Fleming is the beautiful lost love. The only thing that I fault is the fact that the film should have been restored so as to prevent those spots where there are drop outs. Bravo to Amazon for carrying the movie and letting people buy it.
3,A typical 1950's Civil War film,"Those old Civil War films are always the same. They're filmed in the California desert with inaccurate uniforms and weapons. Reagan gives a so-so performance as a Confederate Cavalry officer who finds himself fighting against his brother who is an officer in the Union Cavalry. And of course...there's a woman invoved too. It's a somewhat enjoyable movie, but certainly not a five star film."
3,"Some great stuff, but too much unnecessary","I take a back seat to no one in my adoration of Sam & Dave. However, I must say that this 2 disc collection has too much of what is not needed - a Public Service Announcement about staying in school, and a handful of unreleased cuts (which never saw the light of L.P. grooves for a reason). The live cuts somehow do not seem to capture the Sam & Dave energy.For half the cash, you can get all the hits on Rhino's ""Very Best of..."" collection."
5,Great incite on the faith principle,This book gives scriptural correlation to faith and healing. I recommend that every born again christian read this book.
4,Wonders of God Creation,I chose this rating because it presentation and how it fall all into place.How science proves the existence of a creator.
3,"""Heavy Duty... Well, somewhat.""","Ordered this Knee Kicker to stretch the carpet in our home after a few years of use. Found it doesn't work particularly well on Berber Carpet. Not the fault of the stretcher, just that the Berber is so tough this Knee Kicker can't be expected to stretch it properly. I'm not a carpet installer, so if I had it to do over, and had learned faster, I would have purchased the Lever Operated Stretcher, also sold Amazon. Get the one that includes 4 Bars, Carpet Head, Bracing Foot 23""-59"" adjustable length with 4 attachable bars with the back brace to place against a wall. This unit has a lever action that stretches carpet without having to use your knee. Live and learn. I got so aggressive trying to stretch my carpet that I cracked the cast aluminum on the kicker head. Surprised I didn't crack my knee cap. Live and learn. We always do."
3,"These are for ""BIG KIDS""!","I purchased these for my 2 year-old (with 3 year-old sized feet) and ended up giving them to my 8 year-old daughter, who they fit perfectly. Good quality. Misleading size."
2,Too big and poor quality,Low quality and way too big for the stated size. Found out that Goldtoe sells socks for kids (which are awesome) so these will probably be in our next garage sale.
4,"great, comfy socks",These are my 8 year old son's favorite socks. I continue to buy them even though I think they get holes a bit too quickly.
2,Too big,"It was too big for my kid.He is 10 and shoe size is 6. So, I ordered this after reading its size guide.You should size down when you order it."
5,"Terrific book, interesting for all ages",Extreme Nature is a book that will appeal to readers of all ages who like nature. The outstanding photos and fascinating descriptions of extreme examples in nature are compelling and especially interesting to early teens who like science. My grandson read it cover to cover in one sitting.
4,Very Funny,"I just love fairytales. This was a great collection of hilariously re-written fairytales. I also enjoyed Politically Correct Fairy Tales, but the best I have found so far is Enchanted by Nancy Madore, which combines the the fairytales with erotic fantasies. I think rewriting these classics for adults is a wonderful idea and I never get tired of reading them."
5,Sensuous...,"I absolutely love this scent. I love wearing this anytime of day, even to bed. It's earthy and sensuous though not over powering."
3,"Different from his other work, yet the same","As an owner of two of Farish's previous CDs, I was looking forward to ""Everlasting"", and it doesn't disappoint. The Amazon review further up the page says it all, pretty much. It is different from those previous works. However it is still the same Farish sound, with the one-finger piano work and the other sounds recognizable from previous CDs. I would have given it more stars but there aren't any songs that catch me like on the previous CDs. I know that makes my rating more subjective than usual, but...oh well. This one is a worthy addition to the Farish collection and I look forward to his next!"
1,Process and Practice of Radio Programming,"I have read this book over and over, and I can't figure it out. I bought because I thought it would teach me how to cook. It wasn't helpful at all. 1 star it gets from me."
5,A great gift for little Dragon Tales Lovers,"These three videos are my son's (age 3) very favorite. We can talk about what has occured and relate the stories of Max to his life. We have a new baby in the family, and he is learning to share toys, Mommy's time, etc - the Let's Share video shows him some positive figures deal with sharing issues."
5,Dragon Tales,I was very please with the product - a vhs tape which was still in the original wrapping. It arrived in a very timely manner. I would order form here again.
2,misleading photo..,"the package I received was just 4 small sections of beads, 2 of string and one taken up with a marketing label.. and very little diversity of materials implied by the photo. My daughter would have loved the multi-colored, multi-sized ones displayed but instead I got mostly bland, large beads. Not a total waste but disappointing."
4,Really cracks my nuts,"It's a basic nutcracker. The finish does not wear off. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because after cracking a large number of really tough filberts, the hinge is a little loose."
4,Well Designed,"The Pedrini Nutcracker is well designed and functional. I have not cracked nuts with it yet, but it has done a great job on Crab and Lobster."
2,Very WILSON PHILLIPS,"If anyone wanted to research early 1990's fashion for a Beverly Hills 90210/Wilson Phillips/Shanice/Alannah Myles/Milli Vanilli biographical movie, take a look at the photographs in this book. The pictures are awfully dated but the techniques are less dated. Why do designers get caught up in such non classic fabrics and colors (sandwashed silk and purple with red)? Still a useful book too if you want to set up a hippie craft stall at your local bazaar."
2,Underwhelmed,"This book was pretty ordinary, if you've been embellishing cloth/clothing for any length of time. I bought it hoping for inspiration, but there was no inspiration to be had. Not only that, of the things that were included, I would never use. Today's clothing? Hardly. The techniques/effects were more suitable to vintage sewing than modern. If you must, buy this used, and then pass it along to others. In fact, I'll sell you my copy."
4,Excellent for Clothing Embellishment Technique,"I bought this book without having the luck of breezing through it before I bought it. The book covers beadwork, threadwork, trims applique and bindings and pipings very thoroughly. The photos and drawings are excellent, and the explanation of decorative threads section was super. This book is a great resource for clothing embellishment."
1,This is a poor excuse for a MMORPG don't waste your money,"I played SWG in it's original form ""Pre-CU"" I continued to play during the CURB (combat upgrade) which wasn't too bad becuase the game was still unique & original vision was still alive.The NGE version of the game that exists now is just a pure joke. It's dumbed down for very young kids. There is no challenge whatsoever. I recently decided to test the game since they added talents to the game but it's still the same old watered down boring bugged game.Do yourself a favor and pass on buying this game. If anything just get the demo and see for yourself. One thing will stand out more than anything when you log in You will ask yourselfWhere are the other players?Is this a MMORPG or a single player game?Trust me the servers are empty and this game will be shutting down soon.The force is very weak with this one. Take it out back and shoot it......"
1,Game Used To Be Great,"I have played this game both pre and post NGE, and honestly people, save your money for something better. I was never a power player, I played it for the community. My profession pre-NGE was Master Dancer and post-NGE Master Entertainer. There is no longer a community. Where before the NGE, every cantina was always full of people, the only cantina that has anyone in it now is Mos Eisley. The cities are empty. Player cities are sitting there with empty houses. On city on one planet has any players. The game is truly dead. Don't waste your money. Hopefully LucasArts will fire SOE and recreate a game that people will play."
4,Truly the real experience,This game is the real deal in about ten years this game will be as good as World Of Warcraft.When you make you character you get almost every single detail there is when you pick the classes it lets you see what the class is about.Still the end is a long way from your grasp until you go into space and fly you ship and when you get the money you can customize your ship.You can even get the ship Hon Solos and Chewbaccas ship.Overall this game is worth buying.
2,Don't believe the newer players,"This game is far from the original game that so many of us knew & loved.The NGE is still in-effect, contrary to the other review found herein. All career paths have been gutted so that mastering them is far too simple offering no real challenge. The combat has been dummied-down to the point of feeling like a cheep third person shooter.I played this since release up till about 3 months ago and the game has deteriorated to the point that most servers are relative ghost towns. This isn't the game it once was. I'd suggest steering far clear until a sequel to this game is made or an entirely new Star Wars online experience is introduced."
1,SWG - The Complete Online Adventures is a steaming pile...,Save your money and buy something else from Amazon. This is an old game that is not worth your money. Do not give the manufacturer of this game the satisfaction of making another dime off of this product. Do not think that just because the game has the Star Wars name on it that it is a good game. This game is now an absolute disgrace to George Lucas' universe!
1,Worst MMO I have played,"I've played UO, DAOC, Planetside, AC1, AC2, WOW, COH, EQ1, and SWG is the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced. On launch you could walk into major cities and could be one of thousands playing the game on the server (I played on Bria). After the developers ruined the game (NGE) I only saw 10-15 people max in towns.The entire game down the toilet. Please out of respect for those who bought the game on launch don't buy this game."
1,"New box, same broken game",This product is just another attempt to grab a few more dollars from a dying and terribly broken game. Nearly deserted servers and badly written patches layered over obsolete and no longer usable items still laying around in game makes playing this like walking alone through an endless junkyard.Stay away from this mess. Your wallet will thank you later.
1,Don't waste your time.,"Sure the game is better than it was last year, when you start at the bottom there is only one way to go.Assuming the people that read these reviews have _some_ gaming experience, here is what SWG has to offer.A FPS'ish game that STILL has no collision detection, although collison detection had been promised to be implimented 6 months after release.A FPS'ish game where NPC's STILL spawn in walls, rocks etcA FPS'ish game where NPC can STILL shoot through walls, ceiling etc25 servers to choose from unless you want to actually play with live people, which narrows you choices down to 2.9 iconic profession. Hehe, 1 of which (entertainer) has absolutely no role in the game and another (crafter) that has been marginalized to the role of just north of useless.I URGE people to download and play the free trial. Please do, and when you are done with it, compare it to just about any other MMO and come back here and write a review.But whatever you do, don't spend money on this game."
1,The bad reviews aren't lying.,"They're pretty spot on as to the state of this 'game'. I played for almost a year after release, but quit when I realized back then that the game was just not worth paying for.I came back a couple months with a brand new account to see if it was really as bad now as I'd read. It's even worse.Remember, Star Wars Galaxies has won the 'coaster of the year' TWICE for a reason. With this release, it's on the verge of a coaster hat-trick.Stay far away."
4,The Return Of The Roleplayers,"They're coming back...Is it the reintroduction of Creature Handler/Bioengineering and the nostalgia for old pets? The new Storyteller tools that allow you to build scenarios, complete with combatant NPCs, and all manner of props and special effects? Is it hardcore roleplayers who, after tasting the beauty of Lord of The Rings Online, found themselves nostalgic for the more complex and nuanced gameplay and community of SWG?I really don't know. Maybe it's just this new collection of SWG and its expansions at one very low price.As an old Starsider hand, speaking to old veterans of the unofficial roleplaying server, the roleplayers are back. Old PAs and new ones are popping up. RP cities are repopulating. How long this will last nobody can say, but so far it's been a fun ride for me for the last several weeks and it only keeps building steam.May as well check it out, right? Look at that price. C'mon, ya know ya wanna."
1,a galaxy of badness,well i didnt even get to play it cause i tried to play the demo the demo didnt work and their support stinks dont get
5,WHY DID IT HAVE TO END?,"When I picked Departures up, I never expected it to be so good. Once I got started, my daughter almost had to fix her own meals. (Just humor. Don't call the C.P.S.) I was blown away with lifelike characters and the density of the storyline. All of the characters were connected somehow and I am so glad that someone has shown an example of how good men are instead of depicting us as no good dogs. And where is Paula? I want a piece of her. She was scum. This book had me battling with my emotions over and over again. I related to her daughter so much because I had to go through some of the same things as a young boy. This is the type of material we want to read. Believable stuff that we can actually relate to. Thank you Adrienne."
4,good read,"I first heard about this book from the author herself. I didn't have a clue what it was about or if I was going to like it but I figured it was worth a shot.What a shot this book turned out to be.one reviewer said that there were too many characters and that she was drawn to only certain ones. I think that is the best part of the book. It read like a t.v. soap opera. I loved just about all of the women in the book and some of the men. I think I enjoyed Doug the most.I will say though, being a pisces woman and knowing many piscean women, I was a little offended of Ms. Bellamy's opinion of us. On the contrary to her book we are very kind, caring, loving, and feeling people. Probably the most sensitive in the zodiac.But beyond that I really enjoyed this book and can not wait to read the sequel."
3,not sure,I'm not sure about this battery because I used it in a brand new pocket watch and the watch slowed down in a couple of days.So I'm not sure if it is the battery or the watch. I would need to buy another battery for that.Otherwise it came perfectly fast and was well packed and I was really happy with its price.
4,Quick and easy,"The Hosa Cable CPR202 Dual TS 1/4 inch to RCA Male plugs have a very good signal transfer and are well constructed, making good tight connections. The color coded tips help make them quick and easy to work with."
3,"worked great, but only lasted 4 months","they were great and the price was right, but one side died after 4 months. I use them for DJing, so I expect a bit of extra wear from constantly moving them around, was hoping they would last longer! ordering two this time."
5,High quality cable,I used this cable to hook up my Korg R3 to my home audio receiver. Worked no problem and was fun playing with a 7.1 surround sound system through the keyboard.
5,great cable,i have found in the past that hosa cables arent the best but this one changed my mind. its well built heavy gauge and has great connectors
4,It just works,"What is there to say? The product works, and the price is right. The insulation is rubber-like silicon (I'm guessing), similar to the kind that are flame-resistant. Although it made the cables thick and heavy, but that just shows it's a quality product."
5,Found what I wanted at last!,Been looking all over for this type of cable and finally found it.Plugs fit into one machine and the other end plugs are different and fit the other machine that it has to be connected to.
5,Worked so far,"It's worked so far, over a year of use, I'm satisfied. Would buy again, six words left, now three, done."
5,Buy all 3,"I installed a Burris Fastfire red dot on my S&W 15-22, but it was a little to low. Tried to block it up to see what height adapter to get, ordered that size, then it was a little to high. Ordered the other two heights and one of them was perfect. I would suggest, since these are so reasonably priced, order all three and pay the shipping only once. Very satisfied with product."
2,Poorly written story.,"My 17 month old daughter loves books, so I bought this at the bookstore for her to read in the tub. Unfortunately (like most baby bathtub books) it was sealed up, so there was no way I could preview it before I bought it. The writing style is very awkward, and longish for a toddler book. My daughter, who usually loves being read to, has no patience for me reading each page on this one. She flips through the pages to look at the pictures, but then tires of it quickly and moves on to other tub toys. I've learned my lesson to check out Amazon reviews on sealed books before I blindly shell out the cash!"
1,Shocked by PVC,"My son loves his bath! My mom and dad bought him two bathtime books (not aware of the dangers of pvc) and I was shocked to see that Baby Einstein was still using this product. The smell of the book when removed from its casing was so toxic that we had to throw it away immediately. I am taking the suggestion of a previous reviewer and writing to the company. I may even have to go as far as boycott their products, as the dangers of PVC are VERY documented and for a company to use them in children's products is inexusable."
5,Fun to read and play with at bath time!,"I'm a fan of squooshy bathtub books because my little ones, close in age, love to bath together and ""read"" to each other while we lather up. This book is not only cute and colorful, but the story is lively and easy for little toddlers to love. I recommend this and all the other Einstein Bath books for your wee ones! They are just the right size for little hands, float perfectly on top of the bath bubbles, and hold up well to twists and tugs in the tub. Enjoy!"
5,"simple poetry, our daughters favorite book","This is our daughter's favorite book. The art is very appealing to little eyes, I think, and the words rhyme with a catchy rhythm. I'd have her write the review as to why she loves it, but she'd not old enough yet. Let's just say we have the words memorized.As to the alarmist posts about PVC, read the science for yourself:[...]If it sounds crazy (causes permanent organ damage!), it probably is. Based on my reading (and a graduate degree in science), I'm not worried about the safety of this toy."
3,"A good read, but nowhere near as good as ""Archangel""","I saw the paperback edition of ""Jovah's Angel"" at my local bookstore and snapped it up. I really enjoyed ""Archangel"" and was hoping for a similar experience with this book. As with most sequels, I was ultimately disappointed. I enjoyed the return to Samaria, but I thought the plot and characters could have been much stronger. Delilah and Alleya were caricatures instead of characters: the stormy dark angel and the quiet blond. Caleb was drawn a bit better, but Noah was also a cardboard cutout of a character. I will give Ms. Shinn credit for finally resolving the mystery of what Jovah really is."
4,Perhaps the best of the Samaria series?,"I enjoyed Archangel, but could not ignore several weaknesses in the plot. I found this tale far more convincing, and all its pieces fit well together. Additionally, I found the protagonist, Allelujah, a far more sympathetic character than any others so far. She is quiet and scholarly, thrust into the limelight against her will, and doing her very best to do what needs to be done. She is an admirable character.I am enjoying the Samaria series, though nearly against my will. The ""science fiction"" lacks science, and I usually don't read romance... However, wings make some difference, and Shinn is truly a very good writer."
4,"Not as good as Archangel, but its alright in its own way...","Oi, I was waiting forever to read this book, but when i finished it, i felt it wasn't as good as Archangel, the whole ""Jehovah"" thing kinda threw me, i wasnt expecting that..... The characters are not as good as in Archangel, and the plot completely skewed everything from Archangel, it did. (im trying hard not to include spoilers...^_^) It was an alright book by itself, but its suddeny made me think twice about reading ""the Alleluia Files"". Definitely not up there with Archangel (definitely buy Archangel!) Ja ne! -Sheena"
2,"slow, not much happening",I read and enjoyed the first book. While reading this one I kept wondering when something exciting was going to happen. It was rather predictable. I think the character development was much better in the first one.
4,The sequel that is not really a sequel,"Personally, I was a bit disappointed by the book when I realized that it is not ""really"" a sequel to ""Archangel"" but picks up the thread 150 years later. There is no question that the book is excellently written and that it is a worthy addition to the ""universe"" created by Ms. Shinn in her first book, but somehow I found the characters not as engaging and the plot not as suspenseful as that of ""Archangel."" The fact that Jovah is a computer was a bit too obvious right from the beginning. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend the book for reading - and I am waiting for the next installment."
2,Not one of their better releases,yea there are some good tracks here but too much filler. it's average at best overall.
3,mediocre,"im a huge motorhead fan so i must say this doesnt live up to the other albums,if your lookin for good motorhead my fave album would either be orgasmatron or iron fist, no sleep till hammersmith is great for those who love the raw live sound"
4,"Oh boy, this is fine!!","I know it may hurt, I know it's painful, but the truth is that 1916, due to better production devices available in the nineties, is a better album than the ones of the famous Eddie Clarke era.And as for the tittle-track, I have only one thing to say to the new Gods Of Arrogance (Metallica): if they think that they recorded the ultimate anti-war rock song in ONE, well, they should listen to 1916... What a song, man!!!!"
2,Maybe their worst album,"I love Motorhead, but classic Motorhead not albums like this that sounds so childish. THe melodies are awful and there is not passion , you have a sense that they are just playing for playing had that in their previous albums where playing because they had something to express. Terrible album - If you are new start with Ace of spades."
5,good album,I've only hear a few song of theirs because of The WWE and I decide to buy an album and I liked it. I heard of them in high school but never bought any other albums until now and I wish I would have bought their albums years ago. If you never listen to Motor Head and want to try a new band then give this band a try.
5,"A winner, plain and simple.","1916, Motorhead's 1991 release, is a poke in the eye to all the band's naysayers. From start to finish it never ceases to deliver on the band's plain philosophy of turn up the amps, pound everything, and just blast everyone else out of the room. The funny thing is in going from ""I'm So Bad Baby I Don't Care"" and ""Angel City"" to the (Gasp!) softer sounding ""Love Me Forever"" nothign is lost. Good old Lemmy even comes close to crooning on the title track, when his only accompaniment is a soft cello and bells. Motorhead unplugged? Maybe, but just this once. Motorhead served up another fat helping of beery blues-based mayhem with 1916. Now don't just sit there. Listen for yourself."
2,Don't get me wrong...,"I love Motorhead, but this album just isn't...that...great. This is actually the second of Motorhead's ""mediocre trilogy"" that started with ""Rock N' Roll,"" and ended with ""March Or Die."" Anyone new to Motorhead is advised to avoid these three albums before they have all the other ones, which are all more or less straight up classics. This is not to say that ""1916"" is all bad, but it suffers from many of the trappings of slick, pre-""Nevermind"" early 90's hard rock. Still, there are some hidden gems in mud. ""The One To Sing The Blues,"" ""I'm So Bad, Baby I Don't Care,"" and the final four tracks are all really, really good. It's a shame that the middle songs are all over-produced mainstream hard rock, and not up to Motorhead's usually-high standards. The one exception is ""Going To Brazil,"" which isn't all that great here, but is later souped-up to become one of the highlights of ""Everything Louder Than Everyone Else."""
4,"One standout, and the rest is pretty good","In my limited experience, I prefer Motörhead's 1996 ""Overnight Sensation"" to this earlier recording. Though there are fans around of the dual guitar work of Phil Campbell and Wurzel, I think having two guitarists narrows the sound and squeezes Lemmy's bass out of the already rather constrictive mix.The songs are uniformly good, though: humorous, scary, hard-edged, and always intelligent. And the closing song (""1916"") is so good that it hurts. The melody is lovely and direct, the lyrics as powerful as any Wilfred Owen poem, and Lemmy's vocal is heartbreaking. Characteristic or not, this is one of the best songs I've ever heard."
3,Motorhead - '1916' (Sony) 3 1/2 stars,"Most bands that've experienced as many personel changes as Motorhead has would probably throw in the towel.But not Lemmy and the gang.No,sir!Not only has Motorhead stayed active all these years,but they haven't mellowed out,not one bit.Personally,I liked this CD nearly as much as I do their 'Overkill' or 'Iron Fist' offerings.Love seeing these blokes playing live.Tracks here I thought were showing the band's true colors are ""I'm So Bad Baby,I Don't Care""(perhaps an anthem for some of us?),""No Voices In The Sky"",""Shut You Down"" and their tribute to the Ramones ""R.A.M.O.N.E.S."".Another metal-blasting Motorhead catalog release that's fun to give a spin now and again."
4,New to this band?,A must for the Motörhead library. Solid studio work including some classics from the boys and if you're new to the band this provides a window to an earlier era. And if the title track doesn't bring a tear to your eye you're already dead.
2,missed the mark for entertainment or holiday music,"We were excited to have a new musical addition to our holiday collection. I felt that they tried hard to create a story that would enable them to veer off into various holiday songs. It was, for me, missing on both the musical score and the story itself. Most kids, teens and adults will become bored in the first 3 songs and move on to something else. Sorry, but this missed the mark in our opinion. The orchestra is great, the cameo appearances by known artists were okay - it just didn't meld into anything noteworthy."
3,Levels of Christmas Past & Present,"One can certainly view this Christmas video at numerous levelsL the music, plot, performance, etc.For this reviewer the music and cinematography were great. What failed to gain higher star rating was weak Christmas plot, i.e. social ministry angle of runaway going home. Great story to be sure, but smacks of social gospel, not Christmas gospel. Social ministry concerns certainly part and parcel of true Christmas gospel, but not its essence. This DVD failed to let that dominate and radiate forth.The Crawford rendition of my fav carol was truly wonderful, even if lip-sinking trials frustrate. Turn your eyes, and listen and marvel at the powerful rendition here.Most of the updated carols were terrific."
1,NOOOOO PRODUCT I have been ripped off,"I ordered 2 of these DVD's I recieved the cases with NOOOO DVD, CD anything in the perfectly sealed AND EMPTY DVD case"
5,Great Value for the price,I'm already a big TSO fan and have seen all of their concerts since 2002. This DVD is not a tape of their concert - it is a sweet Christmas story of a teenage girl who has run away from home and is wanting to return. She seeks refuge in an old abandoned theatre on Christmas eve and from there the magic begins. I love watching this video and have already viewed it 3 times this month. I am purchasing this copy as a gift.
5,I have yet to find a comparable CD or DVD to top this,"I can not top the reviews already submitted to you. I just had the opportunity to see TSO in person two days ago at the Irwin Center in Austin, Texas and I can't tell you how much this meant to me. It was a Christmas present from my children. It certainly ranks the 5 star. I have recently ordered the latest CD as I have everything TSO has done. I too hope TSO does another DVD with a performance such as I witnessed the other nite."
4,Love the Music,Bought this DVD and really enjoyed it. Then a few weeks later went tosee the Trans Siberian Orchestra in person. Seeing them in person was so much better. If you ever get a chance to go to one of their concerts don't miss it.
5,Trans-Siberian Orchestra - The Ghost of Christmas Eve,Fabulos. Love this music. Great savings buying it from Amazon. Right to door delivery. This is changing my way of shopping.
5,The best!,"One word can describe this DVD ..................AWESOME!Story telling, and great ROCK AND ROLL put to the old Christmas tunes, Great performance."
5,Great Xmas story!,"Great music, and touching story with a happy ending. Lifts your spirit. 70 minutes well spent! Ien my opinion, this is the best Xmas story for all the family, so far. Beatriz D"
3,Older music - so so story line.,"This turned out to be the Trans-Siberian Orchestra back several years. I feel it was overprices for 45 minutes of story and music. The story is a bit lame. The music is their older stuff. I was hoping for something more recent. I might have given it one more star had it been a full hour, without the story."
2,Sort of disappointed,I did not like it too much. I was only interested in The Children's Choir singing the Christmas Canon. I would have preferred a concert like format.
2,Very strange!,It was a weird plot to follow. Music was great - but actual story was dumb.I guess you can not expect much for $1.99.
2,Could have been better!!,"Don't get me wrong I love TSO, but this DVD was a bit of a let down. While the music is excellent, I could have just popped in my cd and experienced the same thing minus the visuals. I was really hoping that this DVD would feature live performances, but instead we have ""TSO - The 43 minute Music Video"". It would be one thing if we were talking about Brittany Spears or some other no-talent act, but here we have a band that can pull it off live, so why not do it!?!?!?!?! MY only other neg. criticism is the inclusion of Michael Crawford who ruins the great song ""O Holy Night."" He sounds like a cross between the Cowardly Lion and Mighty Mouse. Not a good combo.Anyway, on a positive note, the DVD menus are cool and there are some great Chris Caffrey moments for ""true"" fans. (You know who i'm talking to!) I just don't want anyone else to be fooled and think that this is a live performance, you will be disappointed!Forgive me Jon! Your still the True Mountain King!"
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I so wanted to love this DVD but I was disappointed.The solo performers,good in their own right did not add anything to a TSO performance,if anything detracted.I wanted a full on TSO in all their stunning glory but was left feeling flat.I kept waiting for a crescendo but it never happened."
4,Good DVD - can't beat seeing them in person,The DVD was good and I watched it a few times before the Holiday. Every one else who saw it wanted to know where to buy it.
4,I like it!,This makes Christmas very special. We really enjoy the music and the tone it sets in our home. I tell all my friends about it.
1,"Doesn't fit 5/8"" pin","This would be a great product if the eye actually accommodated a 5/8"" pin, but it does not. I guess the eye is not perfectly circular, but I even tried a fairly hard ""tap"" to get the pin in, and it wouldn't go. There is no way the gate would swing."
5,Great Gothic Horror,"Fans of gothic horror should be very pleased with this offering. Peter Cushing is his usual fantastic self, only this time he is one of the few sane ones. A curse placed upon a sadist and his airs makes for a fast paced thriller born of the competition between Amicus and Hammer studios. While some compare this movie with The Hound Of The Baskervilles, the only similarities i see are that there is a curse, and Cushing is in both movies. The picture quality is very good and while the sound is in mono it too is good. Worth a look."
4,Atmospheric Gothic Thriller Rich With Suspense And Mystery,"Often compared unfavourably with the classic story ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", that it resembles in some ways, I find this wonderful production of ""And Now The Screaming Starts"", most definately stands firmly on it's own considerable merits. It is a fine example of 1970's horror filmmaking from England's prolific Amicus Productions which during this period were the main rivals to Hammer in the field of horror. Blessed with stunning period settings, a first rate British cast of both both young and veteran performers, and many special effects that for the time pack quite a punch it makes for most enjoyable horror viewing. Any vehicle starring the great Peter Cushing, no matter what its artistic merits, is well worth seeing and in this effort depite only coming into the story about half way through he has the perfect vehicle and setting for his finely tooled talents for these type of gothic horror efforts."
5,Excellent Buy!,I love this type of movie! Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. What happened to making movies with castles and class? Great Buy!
1,never recieved,Was looking forward to seeing this but the supplier never sent it and never responded to e-mails.
4,Good cassette player,"If you still use cassettes, this is a nice player. It is a little bulky, but works very well and has good sound. The radio part of it also works very well. I mostly use it at the gym but it aslo works well if jogging or biking. It is weather proof."
2,since when are walkmans priced like antiques?,"Im sure the walkman ( like many other on this site) work like a charm, bringing you all the memories of high school mix tapes. Indeed it is priceless. Buy why the hell would a walkman ever cost $119? I was appalled at the sight of a $45 walkman, but this... this just takes the cake. Unless its going to transport me to the past when i was pounds lighter and less troubled, paying this amount of money for an nostalgic piece of technology seems like highway robbery."
3,Schaum's Easy Outline,"I am conflicted about rating this book by 3 stars, and the reason is as follows. This book is exactly as advertised: it is a very condensed collection of stats formulas (with just enough text in between formulas for it to be called a crash course). However, even as a refresher for someone who knows a lot of statistics, this book serves only the purpose of listing formulas, and not of serving to be a concise reminder of the concepts."
4,required listening,"What can I say? Anything War ever did was always a step ahead of and a step better than anything anybody else was doing at the time. Make no mistake about it, They took Eric Burdon places he could have never gone without them."
1,Cheap,This product is a good idea but very poorly made. Flimsy and cheap. Company was quick and responsive when I sent item back and requested a refund.
1,Bad quality,"Received this for my sons B-day very bad quality, the fabric of the letters are sow thin that when my son played with it for the first time some letters lost there shape and others he ripped them only by pulling them. Two day later all the toy was in the garbage. DONT BUY"
1,Small in Size & Poor Quality,I was very disappointed in the size and quality of this felt board. We love our floor easel but the felt board is in all ways a poor product. It was small - can only fit a few felt pieces on at one time; the letters that come with it are super thin and flimsy (we just threw ours away). I would not at all recommend this product to anyone. There are many other quality items on the market for much less.
4,A read for everyone,"Emilie Carles started out her life the same as many of her neighbors in her predominantly peasant town in France. Unlike her neighbors, she went on to receive an education and break out of generations of grinding poverty and ingnorance. The very fact that she is able to chronicle her most unusual life is a testament to the power of the human spirit. Everyone interested in issues of class and gender influencing biography should read this excellent memoir."
1,Online play Support Closed,"You can not play online this game any more.GameSpy CLOSED the MasterServer.[...]Hey GameSpy Fans!We are sad to say that it's time to say good-bye to GameSpy Arcade and GameSpy Arena.

5,So satisfying (in a creepy fashion),"Took a bit to arrive, but overall, very satisfied. Also, now that Sierra Entertainment is defunct, I can install this game as much as I want.Overall, nice games."
5,Swat 4 Gold,"It's a great game to own. If you like any of the Call of Duty games from the collection this is for you. There are two teams, swat and suspect, and you run around the map trying to kill or arrest the other team. You have a huge collection of realistic guns that real swat use."
5,Swat 4 to the max!,"I've got every single SWAT game from SWAT (5 disc collection) to this SWAT 4. I received the GOLD edition as two pieces, the original game + the Ste. Syndicate. I preferred them separate so that's a plus. Anywho, I beat the game in under 7 or 8 hours but it was 10-fold more challenging than the previous SWAT 3 releases. I loved it and wish Sierra would take note and make a new-age version of SWAT for PS3/Xbox360. That would top them all. But back to this game, it was wonderful. Get yours now!"
3,"Demo was good, game didn't work","I am not sure if it was the game or just the seller. The files downloaded just fine but then I could never get the game to install or work. I did play the demo a lot and loved it, but have no experience on the full game's experience."
5,Very Fun Concert - Great Sound,This is an excellent concert DVD by a gifted band. I have over 100 rock concert DVDs and this on is among the faves.Those that say they couldn't hear the vocals obviously have something amiss with their sound system. The sound production values are outstanding.
3,go-go's are back!,"great concert by one of the 1980's female rock bands. great show with well known hits and new songs from thier abulm, god bless the go-go's. Dvd contains behind the scenes footage. a must see is the go-go's in the van going to the show. wish the show was a little longer. at sixy-six minutes, your left with wanting more songs performed. but at 66 minutes no less, you get a thrilling, moving, concert."
5,God Bless the Go-Go's Indeed,"The Go-Go's STILL have the beat and now we are lucky enough to have a live show captured on DVD. I was fortunate enough to catch the live show in San Francisco and these girls can still rock. A Go-Go's show makes you feel like you've just been to the best party of year. Please don't ever disappear Belinda, Jane, Kathy, Char and Gina, cause I want to keep dancing and singing at your parties!"
3,Very nice to see the girls again !,This DVD showcases a reunion concert the Go-Go's had in Central Park. The group all looked and played well. The band was clearly in a good mood and played their songs just how you remembered them. I recommend this DVD for anyone interested in the group !
1,Can't hear vocals,"If you just want to see the Go-go's and/or hear the bass, this is great. But if you actually want to hear Belinda Carlisle's vocals, this DVD [stinks]! The mix is terrible."
5,God Bless The Go-Go's Indeed!,"This DVD is exactly what fans of any band are looking for.First, a totally awesome concert that proves once and for all that The Go-Go's are back and better than ever. They are so much fun to watch. Belinda Carlisle's endless energy, Kathy Valentine, ever the Rock Star, Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey showing that they still got the beat, and Gina Schock, one of the most amazing drummers of all time. Who else could chew gum and drum like that at the same time? It's a great mix of their Top 40 songs, some older album favorites and some new stuff off of their first album in 17 years ""God Bless The Go-Go's"".The Bonus footage is a fun ""fly on the wall"" view of The Go-Go's getting made-up for the show, Gina's commentary alone is worth the price of the DVD. The footage in the van provides a fun view of what it's like to be a part of the madness that is The Go-Go's.Forget Britney, Christina and the rest of them-The Go-Go's are the real thing."
4,Good value.,"These are a nice set of binoculars for the money. The only thing I regret is that it is limited on how close you can set the lenses together. This can be an issue for children. Otherwise, they are fine."
4,"The Dynamics of Military Revolution, 1300-2050",This is a well written book by two former military officers who share their insights and research on the subject of Military Revolutions and how they have affected the different countries of the world. It is a good read for military history and just those who like military type subjects. This book is somewhat detailed with good historical examples.
3,Dry reading,Boring but a must read for ILE. Well documented. If you have to get this book the Cambridge History of Warfare is a more informative read.
1,salad tongs,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. TONGS DON'T OPEN WIDE ENOHGH TO PICK UP ANY LETTUCE. I SUPPOSE IT MJGHT WORK FOR A LITTLE SHREDDED LETTUCE. MAYBE I CAN USE IT FOR OLIVES OR PICKLES.Pedrini Black & Satin Salad Tongs.
2,"Cute, but that's it...",These are very nice looking but they are too small for salad tongs and since they are plastic they do not work to turn bacon. Oops! Now they are just taking up space in my drawer.
2,Disappointed in Durability,"I bought this toy for my 5 and 9 year old girls - they love Spongebob and this looked similar to the classic fighting robots. The sounds and phrases are very funny. Our game survived about 1 round of action. Spongebob's arms do not stay in the position they are supposed to, not to mention that he is generally unable to chop Sandy hard enough to make her pop. Spongebob pops if you look at him. We were so disappointed. To Fisher Price's credit, when I called them about these issues they sent me a voucher for the purchase price of the toy. I believe the toy is not designed properly. Fun idea - not so fun in reality."
1,Horrible let down!,"This toy looked really cool! When you get it home and the kids get into it, you realize the flaws. The biggest and most important being that Sandy ALWAYS wins! This toy should have never been put out like this. These problems should have been fixed before it came to the shelves. Great disappointment."
2,Spongebob is great but Toy is NOT!,My daughter got this toy for Christmas. If you are Sandy you will win every time. The ring should have been much larger and Sandy will not pop up unless you push her chest. Spongebob pops if you bump him lightly. It is funny with the sounds and voices but it will end up as decor on a shelf. Mattel is sending me a voucher to buy another product since I wasn't able to return it to the store. Great idea that could be fixed if Mattel wanted to. Don't buy it.
5,Awesome,My son loves this toy its way better and way more sturdy than rock em sock em robotd and has voices and sounds
3,"nice, but not for a home bar","These pourers look nice and perform well -- that is, the liquid pours our quickly and neatly -- but one feature they lack is some kind of seal for when the bottle isn't being used. You wouldn't want to keep these attached to a bottle of scotch, for example, since the spouts can't be closed and the contents of the bottle are exposed to outside air. I couldn't tell much from the description and was hoping there would be some kind of open/close mechanism, but it turns out that there is none. Not recommended for any kind of bottle that would normally need to stay sealed when not in use.Also, upon closer inspection these plastic pourers seem a little cheap, since the plastic is very light and the injection molding seams are readily apparent.Not bad considering the price but probably not something to get in hopes of classing up the home bar."
3,"Good game, very hard to score","This is a good game, it has almost everything you may want, but I found very hard to score, I have been playing it in only 3 stars difficulty and I just got draws, when I check I notice that in almost all the games I have ten to twenty shots to gol against four or five, but none of them can score, I found it very hard to."
2,FIFA lover,I just didn't like this game. Probably it was because I have played FIFA since a long time ago. It was weird to play with teams having different names and in weird cups. It made me feel a ilegal sensation. I have no many words. i just didin't like it.
4,Guinnevere!,"""Love For Sale"" is one of my favorites and the rest of the CD is pretty good, if it is the style of jazz you like, but the only reason I own this CD is because of my favorite track anywhere, ""Guinnevere"". If you want to just relax and zone out, let Miles and Ravi Shankar take you on a trip for 18+ minutes. I have listened to this song hundreds of times and never tire of it. If you feel this song, check out Herbie Hancock's ""Vein Melter""."
4,Classic Fun,"I love the classic Space Invaders and I always will. Having it on the DS Lite just makes it so I can play it more often. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes the classic games or for the person who wants a challange, though simple. Enjoy it!!!"
1,the shortest game ever!!!!!!,"This game was horrible! It was fun but only for a couple hours and then it was over all you can do is play the classic version or beat it all over again. So, unless you like play games over and over again, don't buy it."
5,High quality!,This cable has been very useful. I use it to connect my DJ mixer to a power amp. The sound is clean and easy to hook up. The price was very affordable as well. Highly recommended seller and product.
2,Not loud enough,"The radio reception was great! The playback of a CD was fantastic! The ""Beep-Beep"" of the alarm left a great deal to be desired. I could not hear it and according to the hearing speciallists I have excellent hearing. I don't need bass drums but I do need some sound! I had to take it back and am still looking."
2,Won't play CD,"I rec'd this radio as a gift and have used it in my office for the past year. I love the size of it and the design. But, it will no longer play CDs. I had planned to replace it with another player but after learning I wasn't the only one with problems, am opting for another brand. Thanks for the heads up!!"
3,Satisfactory,"I am pleased with the purchase. The display could be brighter if your vision poor, but it's adequate. Easy to use buttons and for the most part self-explanatory. It only took me a few scans of the directions until I became an advanced user.Someone else mentioned noise when the CD player start...there is a definite noise. My wife has an older Dream Machine, and hers makes the same noise. If you're a light sleeper in the early morning you'll hear the noise before the CD."
3,Noisy CD mechanism,"I liked most of the features of this CD clock radio, but having it sitting right next me on my nightstand didn't work very well due to the noise of the CD mechanism starting up. Both my wife and I would wake up to the whirring noise before the music started.I can't say the noise was excessive, but in a silent bedroom, any noise right next to your head is going to seem loud. I now have a Philips CD clock radio, and it goes right to the CD track when I set the alarm and then actually starts silently, so the first thing I hear is music.I will say this clock radio seemed very solidly built, so if the CD mechanism noise doesn't bother you, then I would definitely consider it."
4,"It's nice, but...","I recently purchased this alarm clock to replace the one I've had for the last 10 years. The sound quality is great and the display is easy to read at night. I also like the built-in power backup feature that doesn't require additional batteries. Here's the down-side... On my old alarm clock, I could set both alarms to wake up to the radio. On this new one, only one alarm can be set for the radio, one for buzzer, and one for cd. I was a little disappointed since my husband and I both enjoy waking up to the radio. At least the buzzer isn't too obnoxious. My overall rating is good with this one exception."
4,Gives you what you need,It's great being able to wake up to any track I want on a CD. The operation is intuitive enough that you do not need to read the directions. Being low and flat it fits my nightstand better than most. Only negatives I can come up with is that there is no battery backup and there is no weekend off alarm feature although turning the alarm on and off is brainless. The display can be hard to read sometime and the backlighting cannot be adjusted but it does not keep you up at night either. The sound is okay considering. The CD handling noise is really only an issue at start up and I'm asleep at that point anyway. All in all a keeper especially for the price.
3,"good unit, but hard to read at eye level!","I bought this unit in Dec 2002, and found the features to be good, but the display is small and hard to read when viewed at or above eye level while lying in bed. That's a big flaw!!! Also, the CD player ""start-up"" noise is noticeble, but not incredibly annoying.If I were to buy another one, I'd probably examine the SONY ICF-CD853V prior to purchasing, and I'd pay more attention to the display at eye level. It seems obvious that the display should be readible in bed!I should also mention that I have no vision problems."
3,Might as well be buzzerless,"For those of us who need a loud Buzzer in the morning, this is not the clock for you."
1,CD player is junk,"The CD player/alarm clock was great at first. But after nine months of limited use it refused to play CDs. I think it has the same problem as described in other reviews. When I try to play a CD, 00 comes up on the reader and the player shuts down."
2,cant see what time it is,Truth is I really didnt need all the features. I just needed something to wake me or if I roll over before the alarm goes off tell me how much time i have till it does. For me at least the display is impossible to read and so I wear my watch to bed.Otherwise its a nice looking unit that appears well made. I'll keep looking for that perfect Alarm and this one will find its way into the closet.
4,This was a pretty good book,"When Johnny goes on a trip with professor Childermass, they go into a museum and Johnny finds a tiny skull from a doll house and takes it with. Now he had an evil spell casted upon him."
2,Spell of the Sorcerer's Skull,At the begining of the I wanted to read a different book because it was really boring.More towards the end of the book It started to get WAY better.Over all I thought it was a really good book.
3,good - just not a lot,nice buckets - but don't plan on ordering more than one at a time. I ordered 20 and they came in about 14 different boxes on 5 different days. WOW!
1,Misrepresented DVD,I had seen this film when I rented it. I wanted to own it. I purchased it on this site. The copy was unreadable. I was very disappointed. I ended up returning it. It was a nuisance.
1,Disgusting Sound Quality,"This could have been a good Queensbridge album if the sound wasn`t this bad. There are a lot of good tracks on it but on some the bass is so heavy that even my excellent sound system in the car can`t stand it and others sound like they are played on an old and wack LP-Player. Seems to me as if this is just a mixtape which was produced without any sound standard. Don`t blame it on X-Ray records who released it, I got the CD ""Freedom of Speech"" by ""Hell Razah & 4th Disciple"" which was released on the same Label and it has perfect sound. Good Album by the way.If you are a die hard Queensbridge fan and don`t care about the sound, buy it. Otherwise you should wait for their next album which hopefully will be produced in a studio album standard.Greetz from South Berlin -Germany"
3,Very Faithfully Recreates the Original Vinyl Recording Sleeve!,"This double cd set very faithfully recreates the original vinyl recording sleeve all the way down to the liner notes on the inner sides of the gatefold sleeve. While disc one contains Berlioz's ""Symphonie fantasique"" the second disc for me contain the more interesting and certainly lesser known works of Macmillan, Freedman, Mercure and Morel. These modern composers continue the vein of Berlioz's programme style of music and evoke comparisons with Debussy and Smetana. The sound quality of the discs though leave some to be desired and are not remastered as well although the Toronto Symphony's performances cannot be faulted. Perhaps the original master tapes had deteriorated too much but despite the lower volume levels and obvious hiss and other sonic limitations of the tape to cd transfer, this is a worthy addition to your classical music library."
3,Comment on Books in this Grouping,"I used to buy books like these but I found that URL's change: one tends to get more than a few ""404-Object Not Found"" when following links in such publications. Most are published in 1996 which may mean that links/URL's were listed in 1995. Thats a long time in Net-time so how many links are still useable"
5,praise for Will Self's Grey Area,"Self is one of the most talented British contemporary writers and enjoys this celebrity for good reason. He writes Grey Area in an overwhelmingly cryptic tone saturated with insight in both human nature and the nature of our own surroundings in a surreal world. His observations are scientific anthropological jewels, while his writing mechanics are those of an artist. Grey Area is a book I'd recommend to not only the fan of British literature, short story format, or imaginative writing, but to the most hard - nosed non - reader"
4,Nice SACD series,"I have to start by saying I don't quite know how they've done this series. My guess is they have gotten hold of old mono tape masters and developed software created stereo and multichannel DSD masters. Part of me says ""these are not true audiophile disks"" BUT I really enjoy listening to them. They do sound very good and the material selections are excellent. Some of the recordings work better than others for the multi-channel creations. I tend to think they overdid the echo/reverb a bit in the back channels. Bottom line is for me though that I have now bought six in this series of SACD's and I'm glad I have all of them.The Chet Baker is probably my least favorite but that is purely a style issue. I like his softer jazz style and this is more classic improv jazz ensemble."
2,"Wimpy, Wimpy, Wimpy","I guess if you are going to be picking up about one once of spaghetti these would be fine but if you're after a meal, forget it. They have no strength at all. They are as limp as al dente pasta. They really don't feel as if they will last any time at all. If you are after good looks, these look good. If you are after usefulness, look elsewhere."
4,Basic and functional,"This item works very well, and is reasonably priced. It is a little smaller than I imagined, but that does not affect it's usefulness."
4,They do the job,"I am very pleased with these, but treat them gently. I wash them by hand right after using them and put them back in a crock with similar items. They are lightweight and easy to use. The finish doesn't look extremely durable but for just picking up spaghetti it is adequate and I expect mine will last for many years."
3,A little bit disappointed,"After watching the video of Gloria's Evolution Tour, I expected something similar with the Atlantis concert. This video is different from every other live concert recorded by Gloria. It offers new songs from the album Alma Caribena, with Celia Cruz and Jose Feliciano as guests. Songs (5) of Alma Caribena played here sounded pretty identical to the record, which was boring sometimes, as I was looking for something new, a different sound.Two thumbs up for the new versions of ""Conga/1-2-3/... (medley)"", ""coming out of the dark"" and ""turn the beat around/Higher...(medley)"". Percussion was spectacular.I didn't like the edition of the video...It doesn't show a concise sequence between songs. It's like watching ""the best of Atlantis"" instead of a whole concert. Personally, I don't like that. Audio is OK.My suggestion: get the evolution tour, and wait for the next video."
4,Its always great to see Gloria in concert.,"This concert is for the Latin blood in all of us - even us down here in New Zealand.Its not the entire show I'm sure, but the music is rich and full bodied. Her voice mixed with great musicians is a real treat!!!A must have for your collection."
1,Not Scottish,"No tartans. No kilts. No bagpipes. No shortbread. No moors or mountains. One ghost.""many of the writers included here were not even born in Scotland"" admits Editor Marie Carter."""
3,The Bible Story,Good set of books for children. It introduces the Bible to youngsters. It includes beautiful artwork to help children understand the Bible. It also encourages the children to study the sacred Scriptures later on in great detail.
5,I love these books!,So very comprehensive in teaching you child many different bible stories. We try to read a story every day with our kids and other sets were getting repeated way too often since they were so short.
3,Careful.,"I agree that the artwork is very well done in these books, but the slant is definitely adventist. You would be better served to read the Bible itself rather than getting ""Whitewashed"". Wicklands is a little over the top."
1,Sanitized Evil,"This series does not honestly speak or portray the Bible in an objective manner. It's a sanitized version of the real evil the original ""Book"" condones."
3,charge cable for zire 71,The cable allows me to sync my Palm Pilot but doesn't appear to charge it??
4,da yoopers---what else?,"Hey, it's da yoopers!exactly what you'd expect, or maybe you don't know what to expect. It's funny, buy it already!"
4,Don't Overlook Salvation,"As a Pastor and a desire to spread God's word, this CD has a great message to share with the world. The entire CD is a great witness for our Lord and I feel that many lives can be changed just by hearing these songs. I have been told that Ricky Van Shelton does not live what is in these songs, that may be true I don't know, but I do know that we have a God of second chances. Thanks for a great CD: Preacher Dave"
5,great collection of songs,Absolutely love this recording. RVS has a wonderful voice and the lyrics are very inspiring and encouraging. This disc is a wonderful value.
5,Great music,"If you like Christian music, you will love this CD. I like Ricky Van Shelton and his voice does a beautiful job with the lyrics on these songs."
5,One of the best gospel CDs ever !!!!!!!!!!!!,"Ricky Van Shelton has been one of my favorites since I first heard him on the remake of The Last Foot Print. I had heard that he grew up singing gospel music. So when I recently heard his rendition of I Cried Holy, I knew I had to have the whole album. It turned out to be better than I had wished for, and Amazon.com was the only place I could find it. Many thanks to all of the good folks at Amazon.Sonnie Fullen,"
5,dont over look salvation,i really enjoyed this music am anxiously awaiting more gospel music from rvs
2,Poor Quality,"I was very disappointed in this order. Every case on the order was either broken or scratched. These CD's were supposed to be Christmas gifts, but because of the appearance on the cases I was ashamed to give them as presents. I am very disaapointed. I addressed this issue right after receiving this order but no one ever responded to me."
5,great deal,until they stop selling these for outrageous prices in stores this is where ill be coming to purchase mine.great deal
2,Returned,"Though they were the size my husband wears, they were impossible to get on and he doesn't have pareticularly thick ankles or calf. Had to return."
3,They looked great but.....,"i ordered these boots for my husband because he needed something warm and waterproof for our winter weather. He loved the gusset at the top of the shaft so pants can be tucked in, even his Carhartt bibs however, the ankle fit of the boots made it almost impossible to get them on and off. I think they may work for someone else, but he just isn't willing to deal with the hassle of getting them off and on. I am returning them."
2,too heavy and difficult to get on,"These are beautiful boots - they appear to be totally waterproof, sturdy, and quite warm, but...They are very heavy - too heavy I think to be really comfortable.They are very difficult to get on. My husband sized up a 1/2 size to order these and they were still nearly impossible to get on and then just as hard to get off.End result - these are going back."
3,Keeps coffee and tea hot,"It keeps my coffee and tea hot for a while. The design is smaller on bottom, so it tips in my cup holder. The plastic top slider fell off."
3,"So-so Starter re: policy, basic of admin. Definitely not enough to get you ready to teach.","Want to learn how to navigate workplace politics? Understand the jargon of edu-Speak? Know what to cover at a parent-teacher conference? This is one of my favorite ""for Dummies"" books, as it offers advice that the first-year teacher would *not* be able to find otherwise without an incredibly insightful mentor.There isn't much about lesson planning, classroom management, or keeping track of grades - three activities that will consume more time and energy than anything else your first year. For that I recommend Harry Wong's ""The First Days of School"" better.This book was valuable to me as I started, and I'd happily pass it along to the next rookie."
5,Really Great Intro Book to Teaching,"I am in the stages of deciding whether teaching would be a good career change for myself. Michael Kelley's book has really helped me get a clear picture of what to expect in the world of teaching. It is very easy to read and fun too -- he has a wonderful sense of humor and has some great antidotes. I highly recommend this book. This one will be going in my ""to keep"" pile as I have highlighted quite a few passages worth remembering."
5,Great Gift for Student Teachers,"I found this book after my 3rd year of teaching, and picked it up just for fun. This book gives the best advice and the most accurate description of the job that I've ever seen in print. I wish I'd known some of that stuff before my first year! I'm now in my 10th year of teaching, and I always give a copy of Rookie Teaching for Dummies to my student- teacher as a parting gift. The first year is always rough, but this guide helps make it just a little smoother."
3,okay,"i got this because it was kinda funny and kinda cheap. and one of the character's arms fell right off when i took it out. i'm sure this is just a manufacturing error, results are probably not typical. i decided not to return it because it only cost a couple bucks."
5,the best carbon,"works better and longer than cheap carbon from the pet store. I use this, along with seachem purigen to keep my tanks crystal clean. nothing but the best for my turtles"
1,Very disappointing company to do business with,"I have owned this product for several years now. Generally I thought it was fine, perhaps a bit underpowered in the airflow it provided. However, the real issue became the consumables. The company, Triton, discontinued the product and I have not been able to purchase the filter media, especially the pre-filter, for a few years now. They have abondoned a large number of owners, who paid for the product, expecting it to have several years of service life. If this is any indication of how Triton supports their products, I cannot recommend any product they have developed or market under their name. If it breaks, there is no guarantee they will have spares available to repair the product. One of the worse tool purchases I have ever made."
3,Never Used,"have had the Triton Air Respirator for over a year, and my husband has never used it, seems a little bulky to use on a regular basis or either his allergies are not as bad as he says they are..... It does blow fresh cool air into the mask perfectly and I guess if you dont mind the trouble of taking it out and wearing it during cutting grass, or wood work etc... then it would do exactly what it says it will do... Not sure I would pay as much for it if I had to do it all over again."
2,New Box Disaster for Collectors,"They changed the box from the previous years. As a collector I am not impressed. The doll is very beautiful, but is now very accessible. Both front and back of the box can be removed and the doll can be ""played with"". If you buy this from a store, you don't know if it has been NRFB. This would make the value for collecting go down. Plus, now my boxes don't match and look horrible (with the entire collection together). Overall I am very disappointed."
2,Very outdated.,"This little book may have been helpful when it first came out. It is long past its sell-by date in 2012. I would not recommend it. You'd be better off using Google or some other search engine, and focusing on the area/organization type you want to investigate, from local to national to international."
1,Horrible Book,"This book is one of the worst books I have ever read in my life. In fact, if it were not for the fact that I was forced to read it by my professor, I would never have passed the first paragraph."
3,It's alright,"maybe for this cheap price range this pair is one of the best you can get. However, since it is a single cord.. sometimes the right side stops delivering sounds.. But all u have to do is to replug it into your computer.. anyway.. not a bad deal."
3,they do the job,"My old standard Sony headphones broke while I was on a road trip, and I came across these. They were cheap enough that I didn't have to worry about making too big of a dent in my money. However, I don't think the sound quality is all that great, and wouldn't recommend them to serious listeners."
5,Hosa insert cable,"This cable does its job. its sturdy and flexible.The price and plastic appearance gives it a cheap feeling (comparing to others with metal plug), but the sound coming out of it is indistinguishable from the more expensive cables sold by other companies.I use it to hook up my Fishman reverb pedal to LR Baggs Para DI's effect loop. The length of this cable is perfect for linking just one pedal."
5,Hosa makes good stuff,"I own a lot of Hosa cables. They've always gotten the job done for me at a very reasonable price. OK, they're not Monster cables, but for live sound, I can't imagine there would be much of a difference."
4,Un Gran DVD,"""The Real History"" is a great DVD, is a good way to see the beginnings of Mandy, her first two productions are reflected in this DVD, with her 4 first music videos.You can see ""I Wanna Be With You"" music video subtitling and BackStage, in my opinion one of their best songsdefinitely a good DVD for new fans who want to learn more about Mandy.Amazon thanks for sending the DVD to Peru.Un Gran DVD para los seguidores y nuevos fan de Mandy, gracias por enviarlo a Perú."
1,Maybe its just me,"It may have just been me considering I don't see any other reviews but this data cable doesn't work. It seems to kind of work when I hold it at an angle and don't put it in all the way. Not really sure what thats about. Oh well, I guess I will just go to AT&T for the cable. At least it wasn't too expensive of an experiment."
3,Humanity.,"The author tells a deep and neglected story of how Italians proved their humanity during the worst period of 20th century history, despite Nazi brutality. After Kristallnacht in 1938 the authors family fled to Italy. There his family survived because strangers kept risking their lives to save them. The chilling narrative will surprise the reader with how tenious life was in that era."
2,Mostly Common Sense,"While reading this book, it was plainly obvious to note that it is all common sense. If you have no common sense buy this book, and if you do, use it and don't waste your money. There are many other books out there that will more than amply be able to teach you proper etiquette."
2,inferior product,"The scans were made at horrible resolution and quality such that it's nearly impossible to read as the other reviews say. Some of the more recent issues are scanned at higher quality, but it's easier to obtain hard copies of those issues.The viewer software could also be a lot better. It doesn't let you zoom in past 100%.32 cd's is an awful lot to keep switching, especially if you're looking for a specific topic and the results are spread between several CD's. A DVD version with 4 or 5 CD's would be much more appropriate.On the positive side, having all the issues available in an electronic format is a great idea and that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The poor software design and scans make it impossible to appreciate."
1,buyers beware,"Although national greographics is such a wonderful magazine, this release is not worth your money.The scan resolutions are so poor, the text barely readable and 31 CDs is too much. Even the user interface is not friendly and does not allow multiple pages to be opened simultaneously. I say this is one of the worst products available and its a complete waste of money."
4,Mild and subtle flavor,"This isn't what I'd choose for breakfast; not powerful stuff to wake you up. They describe it as ""bold"" but in my opinion, it isn't that bold. But, still, it is a nice, smooth coffee, with great flavor."
3,Rascals - Very best of,"The recordings on this CD sounded a little tinny, surprising for this day and age."
5,How can I be sure?,"The (Young) Rascals were there for me during happy, and sad times, in the 1960s, and '70s. I wanted to recapture the feelings of joy, and comfort they brought to me, and have shared this cd with my kindred spirits who also lived through that era."
4,Vintage blue-eyed soul,"The Rascals are one of many premier 60's bands that are long over-due for the same reissue treatment that's been given to such bands as The Beach Boys and The Mamas and the Papas. Until that happens, we'll have to be satisfied with the greatest hits packages. This one is typical of such packages in that it starts out with some great tracks, but by the end of the disc, you realize that the term ""hits"" is loosely applied. But hey, it's The Rascals! Nuff said."
4,Bringing Back The Memories,"This is an extremely excellent CD in terms of music and sound quality. It truly brings back memories of yesteryear. I only have one complaint. The main reason I purchased this CD was for the song ""I've Been Lonely Too Long"". It is missing a verse in the middle. I was disappointed in that. Otherwise, certainly ""The Rascals"" have a distinctive sound amongst all groups in the sixties."
3,The Very Best of the Rascals,"I bought this cd just for a few songs that I was fond of when I was growing up. While I still like them, I was dissapointed that only about half of them were recorded in stereo. Still a good cd though."
1,Terrible Sound,"Like another reviewer, I anticipated good sound on this CD, given that it was from Rhino. FORGET IT. The sound quality is dreadful, muddy, hopeless. This is irritating when the CD does a poor job of reproducing cuts from early in their career -- mono cuts that one would have thought no one can murder. But by the end of the disc, when the sound quality implodes during ""People Got To Be Free"" and the rest -- well campers, lights out.This is an offensively bad job of remastering and reproduction."
4,I Missed Hearing Some Of These Songs,I was especially happy to receive this as a requested Xmas gift from my husband. The sound quality could have been improved a bit though.
5,Buy one! Helps with plantar facitis within days.,"My husband and I both have plantar facitis, and it is miserable. This splint helped a lot. Wear it for a week or two straight then about 2-3 times a week and it helps tremendously. A bit hard to get used to at first, but I don't mind it now. It has a soft cover so it doesn't irritate you or hurt anyone in the middle of the night."
1,Terrible,This product does not stay in place. I tried three time and couldn't get to stay on and stay snug enough to actually help.
2,Foot slips out,"This kind of device does work, but unfortunately my foot slips out and straightens overnight, so it is useless. Also, the top band comes to the widest part of my calf and it barely fits. If you have large calves, this won't work for you, either."
1,Silver Mat is a sheet of vinyl,"I returned these mats - they were nothing but a sheet of plastic. It is well worth purchasing the ""coin"" mats. Yes they are double the price - but are great and no comparison to the cheaper ones - save yourself the return shipping fees!"
2,Freddie Jackson BET On Jazz,"I didn't really like this DVD. Freddie Jackson can sing, but it wasn't apparent in the way he sang on this DVD, because he changed the songs so much that they didn't sound like the songs we all bought and loved. He also sang them in a choppy manner, so it was difficult to appreciate the quality of his voice."
2,Dissappointed,Well I would have to say if it's possible to over sing your own song than Freddie Jackson has absolutely accomplished this without a doubt. He over sang every single song. And by over sang I mean he adlibs way too much too many runs and just too much of everything. To me it was nothing like any of his original work. I do not recommend.
1,Disappointed Freddie Jackon Fan,"This is the first time that I have reviewed a product. But, this was so horrible that I had to speak up for the sake of mankind and music consumers. This is literally the worst DVD or CD that I have ever seen or heard and I have thousands of them both. Freddie spent all of his time talking about how much everyone wanted him and no time singing his great songs. He jacked his songs up so bad until they are barely recognizable. Freddie, gain the weight back, get over yourself and sing your great songs the way they where meant to be sang. I have never been to a live Freddie Jackson concert, if this is the way he performs I never will go to one. Music lovers and Freddie Jackson fans save your money and don't buy this trash."
3,OK for newcomers,"If you've never been to Budapest before and want to squeeze a lot of sights into your visit, this is the book for you. It's very accessible what with the images of most major sights in the city. There's not much information to go with the pictures - just enough to satisfy those who want to see the sights but don't care to learn all about them. The real strength of the book is the section with the practical information. Pictures of post boxes and policemen and ambulance cars, a street index, a great variety in the hotel and restaurants index - this section alone is worth the money you spend on this book."
2,Old and Buggy,"Stay away from this software title if you own a Mac and are running OSX.It uses Classic and often crashes.Playback is choppy and my 3+ year old is not very interested in it and has trouble following along whereas in other software she has no problem.Look around, there are better learning solutions for young children."
5,advanced custom painting techniques,this was a very helpful and useful book that helped advance me to a higher level of painting !Thankyou !
4,must have for painting,Great foundation to learn the right habits and methods to do a quality paint job. Well written and great photos.
5,Very nice book.,"Pros: easy language with several photographs, explaining step by step.Cons: I think you should have some clues early in the project, such as removing old paint."
4,Edicion en español,"Hello, I write to him for the following thing, want to know if they have this leafletAdvanced Custom Painting Techniquesand different some in Spanish. Thank you"
2,Half wasted,"The pictures make this look like it is all the same light gray color, fairly small, and all the pieces are about the same size. I have seen postings from Seachem that say the pieces are about 1cm.What I received in the 1L container was completely different. Less than half of the volume was what I expected. The rest was a lot larger than 1cm, up to 3cm (>2 inches), with a lot of dark gray and even dense rock mixed in. There were several pieces of obsidian which is not porous at all, and many other non-porous rocks mixed in. When I called Seachem tech support they said that was because it was ""naturally mined"" and the dense rocks like obsidian did not affect the ""rest of the product."" Nice.Luckily my application did not require a huge volume so I was able to find just enough without any left over. With so much being unusable Matrix is a very expensive solution. I would not buy it again."
1,Not for me,"Matrix might work for someone else but in my Marineland C220 Canister it really slowed down the flow rate, I tossed it."
5,The best bio filter available,I only trust Seachem products for my aquarium needs. I also use Purigen for chemical filtration and the two of these combined creates sparkling water.
5,Great Bio Boost,"I read about Seachem Matrix and I thought I would give it a try. Great product and it really helped give my tank the bio boost that it needed to keep Ammonia and Nitrites at 0 ppm.I have Matrix media in a plastic canister in my extra slot on my Penguin 200, and after about two weeks or so the aquarium settled down and my numbers and levels got in line. I did have to tap some of the big stones with a hammer to make them smaller so they fit just right, but that was fine.UPDATE: 09/22/2012 - Seachem Matrix still wotking. Added it to a canister filter and Ammonia and Nitrites are at proper levels. All one needs to do periodically is give them a good rinse in aquarium water and place them back into the canister filter.SEACHEM MATRIX BIO MEDIA 500ML"
4,James McMurty,"James McMurty is a strongly independent thinker, writer and singer.It's music you can actually listen and understand the words and the meaning. Some of the songs are outrageously funny, ironic and upbeat. I'm also a Paul Simon Fan, Jimmy Buffett fan and a great fan of mondern jazz."
3,Can't go wrong with McMurtry,"You can't go wrong if you like James McMurty. His albums never disappoint. I have gone back and made sure I have all of his stuff, he is an excellent song writer with a haunting voice that is like no other. If you are familar with James McMurtry, you will like this album."
5,I love this album!,"James McMurtry is a great story teller and has a unique voice. Listening to him, is like reading a good book. This is a great album for anyone who enjoys roots rock and alternative country. I love all of James McMurtry's album's, but this was my introduction to his music and I still listen to it."
5,A+ Cables,Purchased 2 50ft HDMI Cables. Recieved them within a few days. Excellent price and an excellent product.
4,Nice variety of projects,"I enjoyed this book for the variety of projects included. Some of the tools and techniques appear to be those used in someplace other than the U.S. It is listed in the catalog as a hardcover book, but I have seen it in softcover at a local chain bookstore (after I had already paid hardcover price.) It is one I refer to fairly often. A good book, but probably not the absolute best for an inexperienced first-timer. For that, I recommend Stained Glass Basics."
4,Aprendiendo,"Me interesa la técnica de los vitrales, y creo que este puede ser el inicio de una gran pasión"
4,Fair overview of Bros music,"This is a good buy for those who do not have original Bros albums from the late 80s. Their debut album Push (which scored many hits on the charts in 87-88 and is considered their most successful work) is presented almost in its entirety except Shocked and Love To Hate You, and there are songs from the other two albums. You really do not need more unless you're a die-hard fan and want to search for out-of-print original recordings. The insert looks cheap, with T Shirts and ringtones advertised, but music is what matters. Strangely enough, no visual credit is given to Craig Logan who split from the trio (yes, Push was recorded by a trio, though you only see photos of Goss brothers) after the first record. In any case, this CD is a good addition to any 80's music fan out there - nothing sensational, just plain quality Brit pop, if that is your cup of tea."
2,Returning it!,"This is a nice looking bag but is way too big and bulky for a petite frame (I'm 5'3""). The shoulder strap is very long and it is too wide for a comfortable fit. The hardware is bright gold and bit too ""80's"" for me. I would have almost considered keeping the bag if the hardware were silver. Other than that, it seems to be a good size for a taller person, is very roomy inside and I like that the insulated bottle pockets are on the inside, making it look like a regular shoulder bag and not an obvious baby bag. I'm disappointed that it didn't work for me."
2,"A bit slow, but still slightly interesting....","I watched this movie solely because I am a die-hard fan of John M. Jackson. John plays the character of Dr. Stubbs in this movie. I enjoyed watching his performance, but the rest of the movie didn't really excite me all that much. Anyone who has a problem dealing with racism or child molestation should probably think twice before watching this. Since the movie takes place in the early 40's, it's full of the attitudes of those days-- the idea that sex is a bad thing and women should be ashamed of their bodies, menstruation is a curse, blah, blah, blah. Dr. Stubbs tries to rectify some of those mistaken notions at the end of the movie, but I was left with the distinct impression that few people were actually listening."
4,Very Nice,"I never liked Judas Priest studio records before this albumn came out.They were always good live ,and I always knew Halford was one of the best Metal singers but the studio records never were as good as the Live ones.They were just way to poppy for me.But this Record changed my mind.I only wish rob Halford would have stuck around to make more CD's like this one.All the songs are worth listening to,and HalFord is amazing as usual.This is a concept albumn and I will admit the Concept is a bit silly,but thats not hard to over look as most of the songs are amazing.The only song that seems out of place on this CD is Touch of Evil.its not a bad song it just seems like it belongs on another record.If you like Pantara,Old Metallica,Megadeth exc. you will like this CD."
5,Best Priest since Defenders,"Rob Halford's last Priest album and the heaviest to date. They spare no one on this album. If you need to get your heart racing a hundred beats a minute, crank this one as loud as your stereo can handle and watch the neighbors cringe! Scott Travis, formerly of Racer X, proves why he's perhaps the best heavy metal drummer out there. Every song unleashes the fury that Judas Priest started in the early 70s. Buy it, if you don't have it already."
2,NOT SO GREAT AS SOME PEOPLE SAY IT IS !!!,"In some aspects, even TURBO is better than PAINKILLER. THis album is about JUDAS PRIEST trying to copy the kind of metal played in the beginning of the nineties. The music is noisy, annoying, Halford just screams and screams.. It has nothing to do with the glory days with Dave Holland on drums. Scott Travis is a great drummer, but he sounds too ""californian"" and does not fit into Judas. People say this album is heavy and so on and so on, but the chords are ridiculously simple. It's a flat and commercial production, disguised in ""aggression""."
