5,Definitely will summon the ghost from the battle field!!!!!!,"Fellows' and Fellas' I won't lie...I'm a recent 18 year old high school graduate who hasn't had the tour experience that the majority of you UGA spreadheads have, but this new cd is smokin', and I know that within the next years of my ""collegiate"" experiece I will live more of the MooN time :-)....although i'll be backpacking when the cd will 1st release and the same time yall will be in my town..some day i'll be there ThE PiGiOnS ArE AlWaYeS On ThE RoOf?!?!?!"
3,"Good, but lacking.","One line summary says it all. I guess I need to give my background like everyone else: saw my first panic show in '91 and loved it from the get go. Since then I have been to well over 100 shows. Every single one was better than the last. I never get tired of seeing them live.So obviously I was excited to get the new disc. But TTMT is just a little weak. Don't get me wrong, then horns and the record scratching are great, but where is the Chilly Water, Fishwater, Proving Ground, Rock, or Pigeons sounding down and dirty rock and roll song. That's my only problem with this one. The just no hard, freakin' lose your mind jam. In my opinion, go buy two copies of the live CD (if you want to support the band by buying their CD's) and give one to someone who has never listened to the Panic before. That'll spread the panic."
2,not the panic i grew up with,"compared to previous panic releases, this one's a big dissapointment....with the exception of 3 songs....one arm steve, climb to safety and nobody's fault...these 3 songs are as good as anything from their previous albums. in the future, they need to to leave the record scratching to the crappers...er, i mean rappers ! having said that...GO SEE THEM LIVE !!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED !! THESE GUYS PUT ON THE BEST SHOW OF ANY LIVE BAND."
3,Not very strong,This is not the WSP that I know and love. This album sounds more like some fancy radio band. Buy their earlier albums instead.
5,Incredible! I highly recommend for all widespread fans!,I just caught them in Memphis for two smokin shows at Mud Island. They are at their playing some incredible music! I'm ready for the new CD!The new songs that were played last weekend were awesome! I suggest everyone get on the spaceship and fly!
3,kamui gaiden,"This is not the dagger of kamui, it is Kamui Gaiden, a japanese animated TV show from the mid-sixties.The main character Kamui who was born in the hinin caste at the bottom of the social order, abused by farmers who were abused by samurai. Hoping to make his life better he joined a ninja clan only to discover that only made him cannon fodder in political black ops. He deserted which of course carried a death sentence.The series is about his adventures evading and fighting the ninja sent to kill him.this show was fairly bloody, tho it was shown at 6:30 right after speed racer(mach go go go) at the time. I loved it, but spanish does me no good, so only 3 from me. english and I could rate the quality of the translation."
5,I play it 5 times a day!,I love it! Takes me back to the 80's and I can't stop dancing.. although I always skip the Jill Scott cut because the crowd sounds weak. But overall this CD is BADDDDDDDD!!!!
4,Mr. Brown is a baa-aad man!,"Is it possible for a CD to have one beat throughout its entire length, and still be as good to your head as to your booty? If Chuck Brown and the Soul Searchers are layin the groove down the answer is yes. Mr. Brown invented one beat--the go go beat--and he's stuck to it, but what he does on top of that beat is what keeps your attention. His guitar, the bass, keys, and especially the horns are all over the place in the jazziest sense of the word. Brown is a master, classy MC for the party. I have several other live discs by CB and this may be the best. Recommended highly for anyone who likes their music loose and funky."
4,Looks like a piece of antique,"This book was shipped fast. It was a very old version, although in good condition."
3,these reviews refer to the Gene Hackman version,"I have not seen this movie myself, but have just discovered that the same reviews show up whether you are looking at the 1984 Gene Hackman movie or the earlier Italian version starring Anthony Quayle. Just make sure you are buying the one you intend to get."
4,unconvential christmas album,DHC really does a great job with this CD. A very different take on a Christmas album.
5,Emotionally Intelligent Interfaces,"Emotionally Intelligent Interfaces are definitely the next face of the Web. It's just a shame that it's been so long in coming. Eternal Ecustomer does a fine job of introducting the concepts involved in creating and usine intelligent interfaces, synthetic people, and intelligent data warehouses,in a way that is very easy to digest, even by computer novices. I've used the book to help my customer ""get"" what internet-based service is all about. I recommend the book highly."
2,Not for people in the business,"This book is not for people in the business of developing web sites for a living. The table of contents looks to be so promising with things like emotionally designed interface, etc. In the book, most concepts are not described well at all or they are described seemingly by someone who's just getting their feet wet in the biz. I hardly ever find a web book that I don't glean a couple interesting tidbits from but this is my first one.It's great if you're getting your feet wet, not so great if they're already wet."
1,Details count,"Technology books don't age well, but I actually wrote this review in my head four years ago. I'm just now putting it on Amazon.Bergeron uses a lot of examples to illustrate his points. One is dining in ""an upscale Japanese restaurant"". We're there as Bergeron describes the orchids on the table, the helpful server, the relaxing ambience. Then he gets to the fortune cookies.Fortune cookies?!? Japanese restaurants don't serve fortune cookies!And it's no mere editing mistake: ""Japanese"" and ""fortune cookies"" are mentioned several times together.How can I trust an author who is this sloppy with details?I finished the book disillusioned and convinced that it was written only to cash in on the tech boom. If you take only one message away from ""The Eternal E-Customer"", let it be: Get the details wrong at your peril. Sweat the small stuff."
3,Wonderful acrylic frames,These frames are wonderful. I have them all over the fridge as well as on our deep freezer to show off all of the family. There were many more frames in the package than I thought there would be.
1,No dosage information,"Typical of many products on Amazon, this product, along with quite a few vitamin and mineral supplements, does not indicate the dosage amount. The back side of the bottle is not supplied on the images and nowhere in the so-called product description is the supplement milligram information.Amazon needs to do some work overall on all its offered products, with better product descriptions, but with vitamins and minerals, its important to know the strength of the item you are purchasing."
5,You'll need this to print wallet-sized photos,"My Canon Selphy printer didn't come with this attachment, so I bought it here. There's not much to say about it, it's just like the 4x6 paper tray that comes with the printers, only smaller. So, let's instead talk about the wallet sized prints--they're fantastic. I like to always have a recent photo of my girlfriend and myself in my wallet, and this helps me do that. Wallet-sized prints are also a nice thing to give to those you love."
1,"a VHS copy, very poor quality in many songs, PAL dvd","if you like LUV, this is probably the only version you can get in, its a PAL, not NTSC, and not all region, as listed on amazon, songs are good, but the quality is a direct copy from many diff source, mostly from VHS. you need to have a PAL dvd player to play this, or you need to set to region 2 on your pc. the sellers wont tell you the product info, so beware, if there is a true DVD quality version, i would rate this 5 stars because its got LUV's greatest song, you can find some music video on YOU TUBE, which is a direct download from this dvd, there are 32 video songs, some are repeated songs of diff video music, i didnt mind knowing this in advance as i searched product info, but didnt know this was a PAL dvd and copy from VHS."
1,3 Wise Guys Beware!,"While there are a couple of gems from classic Italian swingers like Vic Damone, Al Martino and Jerry Vale, the rest of the album is full of second- rate singers and horrible versions of Christmas songs (Dion especially!). And how can you have a definitive Mob Hits Christmas Collection without the big paesans like Perry Como, Sinatra, Dean Martin or Tony Bennett???? This is one offer you can refuse!"
2,LIST OF TRACKS WITH ARTISTS INCLUDED,"1. Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas - Jerry Vale2. Winter Wonderland - Vic Damone3. First Noel (The) - Connie Francis4. We Wish You A Merry Christams / Silver Bells - Al Martino5. Blue Christmas - Frankie Avalon6. Do You Hear What I Hear? - Bobby Vinton7. It Came Upon a Midnight Clear - Rosemary Clooney8. Shake Hands With Santa Claus - Louis Prima9. Jingle Bells - Paul Anka10. Merry Christmas Baby - DionI AGREE WITH OTHER REVIEWERS ON THE FACT THAT MOB HITS MAKES YOU THINK OF ARTISTS SUCH AS MARTIN, SINATRA, BENNETT, AND COMO. HAVING SAID THAT, THIS IS AN OK CD FOR THE MOST PART - ALL OF THE ARTISTS ARE WELL KNOWN - BUT A COUPLE OF THE ARRANGEMENTS AREN'T TO MY TASTE - ESPECIALLY DION"
3,not what I was looking for,I ordered it because I thought this song was on it. But it wasn't. It could have been my fault.
5,A must read for ALL students!!,"Honestly, you can't introduce this book too early to your kids. The principles and lessons are applicable at any age. O'Brien offers sage advice and my only regret is that I didn't know about this book sooner! It is an easy read chalk full of savvy advice on how to get good grades, developing time management skills, the importance of extracurricular activities and so much more. O'Brien's strategies are applicable to any student: middle school, high school AND college. I encourage anyone with children, to get this book ASAP! You will not regret it. It is both inspiring and motivating. I gave it to my high school junior and she really enjoyed it! The examples he offers are real world peppered with a sense of humor to keep it interesting. LOVE THIS BOOK!! Can't wait to see what O'Brien writes next!"
5,A must read!,"Making College Count had real world advice that I could relate to and use in my everyday experiences. I wish I would have read it before my second semester, but it's never too late! I recommend that all incoming college student to read this and get their priorities in order!"
3,Nice first approach to Eastern philosophy,"Alan Watts spent most of his life studying Eastern philosophy until he died in 1973. This book is in fact three books in one that try to describe Zen, Tao and Meditation. It is very hard to grasp these complex pillars of Eastern thought and this books give merely an introduction to them. They are very easy to read and concepts are explained very simply. Perhaps this is why I didn't give it more than 3 stars. I expected some complexity and deep analysis on this three key aspects of eastern wisdom."
4,Poweful overall effect.,"I don't usually like modern works that use a speaker to recite poetry to music. Schoenberg's Ode to Napoleon works, I think, but Berio's Laborintus II doesn't, nor have many others, until this work by Huber. He has a male speaker, accompanied by double bass, recite Heinrich Boll's bitter and angry poem about the destruction the Germans wrought on their victims and ultimately brought upon themselves (when their cities were bombed). This is set against the background of choral settings of Hildegaard of Bingen's mystical accounts of visions, with music drawing on modern serialism as well as early music. The overall effect is stunning, putting the listener into a sort of double time-frame, of eternity (with visions of love overflowing the universe) as a backdrop to modern horror. This work is a powerful attempt by a modern German composer to come to terms with the awful legacy of 20th-Century German history."
2,A Disappointment,"One would assume that the reason most people buy Paul Simon music is because they like the music he plays as he plays it, not arrangements that merely borrow Simon melodies and lyrics, or at best, approximate his fingerpicking patterns. Alas, if you buy ""Paul Simon Greatest Hits Songtab Edition"" you're not going to get anything close to authentic transcriptions on most of the included songs. The arrangements in this book are often quite nice in and of themselves, but considered as transcriptions, most of them would rate from mediocre to poor. While this book might appeal to someone seeking simplified fingerstyle arrangements of Paul Simon songs, for the intermediate to advanced guitarist seeking genuine recorded-version transcriptions, this book can only be something of a disappointment."
1,Waste,Waste of time and $Book is too long. No real test strategies or tipsReading too long and detailed0/5 starsNo help for lsat
5,Highly recommend!,"This item along with the Powerscore Logic Games Bible are must haves for LSAT study! I wish I would've spent more time on this book though. I took the June 2008 LSAT and receieved a 153. My logic games section was my best with 21/23 correct. I know that if I study this book more that I could definitely improve my score, which I plan on doing this upcoming October 4 LSAT! I've already pre-ordered the Powerscore Reading Comprehension Bible which will ship on Sept. 4 from Powerscore's website because that's by far my weakest section. If it's anything like the other books then it should be a big help!"
5,"Totally helpful, tangible advice.","This book was extremely helpful with regard to the logical reasoning portion of the LSAT - after reading it while simultaneously drilling certain aspects of these specific problems, i see a definite improvement in my performance in this section. The advice given is totally practical and very tangible. I totally reccommend this to all ranges of LSAT takers."
4,Great LSAT Study Guide,"I bought the reasoning bible after working through the logic games bible. I found that the strategies set forth in the reasoning bible were superior to some of the strategies I had learned from my prep test course. By implementing the tips and strategies in the bible, I raised my score. I would recommend this book to anyone who is preparing for the LSAT."
4,thorough and helpful,"this book explains all the answers and how to tackle each type of question stem. it also really assists in reading and identifying the parts of the stimulus. this book will help you identify false answers for all the types of questions. however, i think that the greatest book would explain confusing stimuli. some stimuli are really complicated and those need additional breaking down."
3,good,Well explained. Powerscore is always solid. Now all you have to be smart and smart...and smart. I hope they sell in a package with Game and Logic.
2,Waste of my money,I felt that this book was a waste of my money. I hardly used it and what little I did open it I didn't find it to be helpful.
5,The best LR book ever,"Really the best LR test prep around. While it does not have as many practice problems as, say, a Kaplan book, it actually does teach you to think like the testmakers. It has extremely clear, detailed reasoning. If you use it, start it asap (ie, not a week before the LSAT). The lessons do take some practice before you can use the skills efficiently and decrease your time per question. Happily, this book does not do the whole wink-wink-aren't-we-all-on-the-same-boat tone. It's more expensive, but I think that is because they pay copyright for actual LSAT LR questions."
3,Use 7Sage Instead,"While this book is helpful, I found an online curriculum called 7Sage to be much more helpful. This book seems to miss some fundamental conceptual ideas behind the questions, while focusing too much on ""easy"" fixes to get you to the right answer. While that might work for the majority of the questions, if you're looking to be a mid-170s scorer, you need that conceptual background to get the curve-breaker questions correct. I got that background in a much easier manner and more quickly through 7Sage, and so I'd honestly recommend that program over buying this book. 7Sage focuses on things like the concepts that link principle and sufficient assumption questions, rather than teaching those in isolation the way this book does."
3,"Good, but kind of laborious","I thought this prep book was pretty good, but it was a monster to get through, so get it early. I don't think it was as helpful as the Logic Games Bible by PowerScore, but it was generally useful because it helped break down the question types and told you what to look for with each. However, I felt that practicing a lot with the actual LSAT tests was better for test preparation. If you need a supplement, PowerScore is the way to go, but don't expect quick solutions."
5,Great,This is an amazing book. It will raise your score and help you get over the hump keeping you out of law school.
4,Must have!,"If you plan on taking the LSAT buy this as one of your guides. It was easy to understand and came with hundreds of examples. I am even using the book for fun when I am bored. Most of you will not do that, but for people who like a brain challenge I say this is a great book for it. Beware, it's huge."
4,Love this book,It helps explain so much and helps get the correct answers!! I understand arguments so much better. It's a must buy for future LSAT takers
4,Excellent comprehensive explanations.,"This book covers every type of LR question featured on the LSAT and goes over them in great detail. Though I feel lots of LR is just intuitive, I did learn quite a few helpful tips and tricks from this book.The downside is that the proportion of the book that is actually practice questions is small, almost disappointingly so.Overall, I would definitely recommend this book. The thoroughness of its instruction is unmatchable."
1,misleading: you won't actually save $ w/this purchace,"this product contains 8 oz containers-- exactly 2 times the size of the smaller box. additionally, the ""sale"" price is exactly two times the cost of the smaller box. to advertise that buying this product saves $ is misleading."
2,"Gross texture, not fun at all.","I'd been using Proactive for mild/infrequent acne and general skin maintenance when I decided I wanted something cheaper to clean my face with.And...you get what you pay for, really.Texture on that cleanser is just gross. It's like...hair gel. And the cleanser made my face red and irritated and I've got skin that's pretty hard to irritate.If I were interested in saving money I might buy Proactive cleanser and use this system's toner and lotion, since I've got no complaints about either of those."
2,all Lies,OK the guy that called slipknots music pure crap you are very ignorate not everyone is going to like the same music as you. To the kid that said this has great sogns on this you might want to but the album before you review it because there are no songs by slipknot on it
2,Big Disappointment...Don't Bother,"After loving Trekkies I, we ordered Trekkies 2, an obviously PC response to fan backlash from the hilarious portrayal of Trek fans in Trekkies I. Trekkies 2 is a yawn...slow and boring with very few colorful fans other than updates on megafans featured in Trekkies I."
3,A good followup to Trekkies 1,I enjoyed the follow up on the two people from Trekkies 1 and enjoyed seeing Star Trek fans around the world
4,Donovan - 'Hurdy Gurdy Man' (EMI),"Nicely assembled twenty track collection of tunes by none other than THE '60's folk/rock stalwart/icon,known simply as Donovan.I've never been the biggest Donovan fan,but I need to be in 'the right mood' to properly enjoy this music genre.Most of his great tunes are here,like the title cut ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"",""Get Thy Bearings"",the beautifully done ballad ""Jennifer Juniper"",""A Sunny Day"",""Lalena"" and ""Catch The Wind"".So,get out those love beads,lava lamps,tie dyes and Scooby snacks.Long live the hippy era!"
4,Works well,I've been using the lipbalm for a few months now. I'm pleased with the results. The product works well and as advertised.
1,This book was a waste of my time and money,"Poorly written, this book continues in Dr.? Warter's tradition of new age mumbo jumbo masquerading as a self help book. Lot's of words, no substance. Aside from needing to take some writing lessons, this guy would benefit from some serious study of his subject matter."
3,"Good, but not great","As I write this review, there are only 4 other reviews. 2 people give it 5 stars and 2 people give it 1 star. As a person who has read hundreds of books on the subject of transformation, I feel well qualified to give this book 3 stars. He does give you 101 ideas to further your spiritual development and only a total rock would not get anything out of any of them. I found many of his recommendations valid and even a few novel and new. On the other hand, yes, compared to the works by Eckhart Tolle, Byron Katie, and some of the other ""top"" authors, this book is lacking in depth and the ""wow"" enlightenment factor. So for that reason, 3 stars, which according to Amazon means, ""It's OK."
3,product works as promised but came with parts missing,"Despite the fact that the directions were a bit confusing, I was able to install it in about 2 hours. The product works as expected - I have seen about a 1 mpg improvement in fuel efficiency, but it is definitely a bit noisier, though not to the point of being intolerable. One of the O-rings was missing so rather than break down, send back and re-install, it's just easier to go to my favorite hardware store and buy another o-ring."
1,peculiar translation.,"This book started out with a great idea, but fails to build on it. The lead character comes across as hopelessly passive, and there is too much suffocating atmosphere and too little movement.Apart from that, the translation from French is very peculiar. The author writes sentences like: 'the wind blew through the trees like a woman holding her skirts over an airvent' and 'the woman wore her cheekbones like other women wore high heels'. Not grammatically wrong, but it makes it hard to take the author seriously."
1,Not for large breasted women.,"This product could have been made better. There was no support at all, the straps could have been stronger which would have helped. Was greatly disappointed. It is hard finding a product when you have large breasts."
3,If you have more than a (real) C cup - take a pass,"If you have natural breasts that are older than 25 and more than a C cup, it looks okay but not the best. Does run big band wise so order a size smaller. Material is nice. Again, not helpful in lifting large, real breasts ."
3,Not very helpful but ok,"I have 2 cdj 800mk2's and a djm 700. This dvd uses a lot of different equipment. They don't spend a lot of time on cdj 800's or cdj 1000's, which seem to be the 2 most popular cd turntables. Also it was made in 2003 and you can tell. They spend a lot of time on american dj software I have never heard of I believe is obsolete, which is a bummer for the 4 people who bought the american dj software. This dvd should be on the clearance rack for like $5.99 that would be a reasonable price since all the gear and software they use is obsolete."
4,Electric Guitar played by the Master,"This album, while not representative of the years when Les Paul and Mary Ford ruled the charts, captures some very tasty guitar playing. Les is of the school of music which says ""if you want to deviate from the melody, you'd better have a better one!"". Students of lead guitar and jazz improvisation would do well to study this album closely. The Master presents the electric guitar with practically every effect and treatment that made him famous, yet with a touch and sensitivity which shows his supreme artistry at its best. Mary's lush voice is only present occasionally, which is a pity.Les Paul started the electric guitar fire. Lest we forget.P.S. Amazon.com's database cannot decide whether Les Paul is a Jazz, Rock or Pop artist. Neither can I!"
1,Awful,"This was the worst product I have ever bought. I have used various plate guards. This product would not remain on any size plate. With very little pressure it proceeded to fly across the table. I even had to pay for return shipping because it wasn't ""defective"""
1,Simplistic nonsense for the economically illiterate.,"This work has the dubious distinction of having convinced many well-meaning Catholics to become socialists. It consists in a collation of warmed-over Aristotle, economic misunderstanding and historical fairytale, all put together to justify the state interfering in every aspect of your (economic) life.Did you know Capitalism was really identical to Communism? That you shouldn't be allowed to sell anything below what it cost you to buy/produce it (whatever that is supposed to mean)? That the state should not allow you to take out a loan or buy insurance, let alone advertise your business.If you are willing to believe this kind of nonsense, by all means, go ahead and buy this, and I pray sincerely that you never end up in government."
5,It works!,"We took this camping with us, and it works really well. I have two coolers, one for food, and the other for drinks. I put the eggs near the bottom so they would stay cold. With everything layered on top, not one egg was broken. A good product and worth spending money on because there is nothing like eating eggs in the morning when camping!"
5,Great in coolers for camping,"The Coghlan's egg carrier works great in coolers where you may have to stack a few food items and where ice (and ice water) may be interspersed in the food items. The case keeps the eggs from getting broken and accommodates your standard large eggs. While the container is not completely water-tight, it beats the recycled paper egg cartons which turn to mush in water. We have put both uncooked or boiled eggs in these for camping trips and have not had a cracked egg shell yet. Another plus is the packaging says ""Made in Canada"". The red Coleman versions are made in China and cost more. I found these Coghlan's egg carriers at my local Fleet Farm for a little over 2 dollars."
3,"It works, but get a better price elsewhere.","Regardless of the brand, all of these types of egg holders seem to be of the same quality; if not the same manufacturer. While this was only priced at $5 when I made my purchase, I have seen them since at stores for $3."
4,great egg holder for that family camping trip,My kids love eating eggs on a camping trip. Everything taste better in the great outdoors. Fits a dozen eggs for a short trip. Stays safe in the cooler.
3,"hummm, this is different","Bucket of Blood; Well,if you like B&W [beatnik] movies! Actually,the ""idea"" of the movies was interesting. Pretty slow moving though. I gave it 2 stars for originality. My Son The Vampire; Also a slow start. A little silly for the most part[the robot] I had never heard of Mrs. Riely before, but the part where they all chase one another around the room was pretty funny. Not a bad price for the one I did enjoy watching."
1,Worst Deveraux By Far,"I've read several of Deveraux's books, and have generally found them great escapes. This was horrendous! Several times I wanted to give it up. So many gaping holes in the character development that it was almost laughable -- were it not for the fact that I paid 7.99 for the kindle version. Last time I'll ever do that!"
3,A Knight to Remember,"THE TAMING by Jude Deveraux brings all of the romance of a gilded era to this exciting tale. Liana Neville, both courted and pampered for her beauty and her dowry finds her heart with a man engaged in a bitter feud.The pace and the plot are a fast and easy read.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and QUALIFYING LAPS.Writing as a Small BusinessHaints"
3,A Hero to dream about..........,"Liana is being pushed out of her house by her step mother and what's a girl to do?Enter the knight in shining armor!Rogan is a strong and handsome man- the perfect hero! The fact that his clothes and hair are lice infested is no matter. It was love at first belch for our heroine Liana. Upon meeting our dashing hero she is madly under his hypnotic spell as thinking her a peasant girl he barks at her to clean his shirt and trousers. Gone mad with desire Lianna succumbs to a kiss. They reluctantly part, neither knowing who the other is. Lianna soon discovers though he is the warrior who had come to offer for her hand in marriage! Lianna, still starry eyed from their flaming kiss agrees to marry him and they are soon wedded in heavenly bliss. Only Rogan has....commitment problems. And Lianna discovers to her horror that this might not be a match made in heaven but a match made in....!"
3,"Devereaux is one of my favorite romance writers, but...","This book was pretty disappointing. For one thing, it took me over a week to read it. I put it down, forgot about it, remembered the next day.. I NEVER do that with a good romance.Devereaux's style is less melodramatic than that of most historical romance writers that I've come across, and in this particular book, the writing is very smooth. I just didn't like the hero at all. He was one of the least appealing heroes I've ever read about in a book.But that wasn't really the problem for me. What it comes down to is that I felt ""yucky"" reading this book. Instead of lifting my spirits, this book depressed them. The hero was pretty degraded and he treated the heroine with such disrespect that I stopped pitying her and started hoping she'd leave him.While I don't recommend this book, I can easily recommend other Jude Devereaux books, ""Remembrance"" and ""The Heiress"" come to mind as excellent examples of good, fun historical romance."
2,who would want to marry the hero of this book?,"Rogan is a flea infested male chauvanist, greedy and brutal. There is not an ounce of romance in this character, and the heroine would have been better off with the man who wanted her early in the book. Sorry folks, but this is not a romance, it is a fantasy."
1,Disgusting,"He lived in filth, he smelled terrible, he slept around and had a whole lot of kids he didn't care about not to even mention he couldn't remember her name. Also, the story of the Lady and the castle was never resolved, she just left it and never bothered to do anything with it. This was one sorry book all around. I could not get around the fact that he smelled and that she would even let him touch her. This book made me sick."
5,Jude Never Fails,Jude Devereaux is the ultimate author. She creates beloved characters and places them in wonderful places and situations. She never ceases to keep her readers enthralled!
1,Disgusted,"I have been reading romance novels longer than I can remember. But never have a read a book that was this disgusting. I hated the fact that he slept with other woman, had all these children running around, the filth he lived in and he could not even remember his own brides name and we almost at the end of the book! What!! This was my first Jude Deveraux book and I was highly disappointed. Who writes about things like that? I am afraid to say that giving this book 1-star is still too good. TRASH FOR SURE!"
1,The Taming,Ended abruptly. Main issue not resolved! Not as well written as her other books. Very disappointed in this book. Probably will not read any more of her books.
1,Don't be misled,Farrar's voice just doesn't fit the music. This one is only a flea's shadow in comparison with the first two albums.
2,Not Danny Joe Brown,"While all of the other musicians are the same from before, vocalist Danny Joe Brown is not on this album. In my view his voice is a major factor in the success of the first two albums, which are both really excellent. If you really like the first two and like what Danny Joe Brown brings to their sound, you will most likely be disappointed with this work. Danny Joe delivered their aggressive lyrics with confidence, authority, and credibility."
4,Badminton Rules,"Pat Davis does a good job with an overview of the rules of badminton. You get a brief history, racquet, shuttle, court and scoring information, faults and even a chapter on officials. There are some weaknesses: The wording in the scoring section left me wondering who could do what when the score was tied at 14. The diagrams are in meters with approximate English measurements - the width of the court comes out a foot too narrow. Despite the minor faults, this book will let the reader understand the basic rules of badminton."
4,amaryllis,"this was my first jayne castle, and has made me a delighted fan.Her characters have so much life, and humor, you feel like you really know them.I have purchased every one I could find."
1,This book went from boring to just really bad...,"This is the second book that I have read by this author, under the name Jayne Ann Krentz. I picked it up from the library. Had I known this book was by the same author that wrote, ""Dawn in Eclipse Bay,"" I wouldn't have bothered.Not only was the concept not believable but it was just plain stupid. The writing is juvenile and the characters were neither interesting nor likable. I found myself not caring one way or another about the out come of the book. ... It was a real struggle to finish this book. For those of you who will read this review before you read her book, DON'T... Try JD Robb, you will not be disappointed."

5,Dimensions Needlecrafts paintworks,It was everything that I was looking for and the service to get it here was great. Thanks for doing such a great job.
5,"JParis ""660"" review","What a killer record. Short, I would have liked to hear more tracks, but overall, great album."
5,JParis rocks,the best cd i've ever heard! these guys know how to handle their instruments. without doubt worth it to have one!
5,soothing,"Very musical music! The style of Mr. MacAlmon is very ""listenable"" and beautiful. I often put the cd on when I go to bed and am asleep before it ends. I would recommend any of his cds to anyone who wants to lose himself and all his troubles in music, and in focusing on God's greatness."
2,Not good for historical purposes,"This book contains certainly the most recent 'complete' English translations of the corpus of Amarna Letters, however the translations themselves have been challenged several times in the last years for being extremely inaccurate when dealing with the old and much debated problem of the coregency between Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV. Here the translator of the texts chooses to render certain difficult and problematic passages as if they would appear contrary to a coregency, while exact translations reveal that they are not indeed. So while the book is good in general, it is to be avoided when dealing with historical and, most of all, chronological problems related to the succession of Amenhotep III. See for this the strong comments of F. J. Giles and A. B. Knapp in 'The Amarna Age: Western Asia', vol. 1, 1997."
3,A sampler,"It's hard to tell who the audience for this disc is, especially as now that it has fallen out of print it, along with the rest of the Arditti Quartet's recordings on Montaigne, can only be had for high prices. What we have here is a sampler of the Ardittis' recordings on that label to date. The composers represented are Birtwistle, Carter, Dusapin, Ferneyhough, Kagel, Kurtag, Lachenmann, Mache, Nono, Rihm, Schoenberg, Webern and Xenkis.However, with the exception of Ferneyhough's two-minute ""Agadissimo"" and Birtwistle's ""Movement"", none of the pieces here are presented in full. You're just getting extracts. Even one of Kurtag's fairly short pieces is presented here through only four of its movements. This might be a helpful disc for public libraries to help listeners find new music to hear, but for the fan at home I should imagine it has little appeal."
2,I've used it a year - and I'm abandoning it!,This is a very appealing unit - but the predesigned plastic pressure arches are too 'open' for both Rico and Vandoren reeds for the clarinet (Bb). I've ruined two reeds as the tip of the reed can easily get pinched by the hinge in any of the outside slots. I'd block those four - but the remaining slots are also at risk - not worth the price! A good reed easily costs $5 to $10 after culling out the less than great ones - and two destroyed reeds exceeds the cost in this item.
1,Risk of pinching reeds,"Pros:- Looks great, very slimCons:- The very left and right slots do not have enough room at the top. Closing the case may pinch the reed tips. This leaves 8 usable slots.- The layer with the reed slots is stiff (I was expecting a more free-flowing flipping between sides like with the Rico reed case)- The reeds are a super tight fit and difficult to pull out and push inYou are better off spending a few more bucks on the better reed cases in the market."
4,Awakening,I've studied the subject of the NWO for 20 years. I appreciated Mr. Bowers&#65533;s integrity to speak the truth. The truth is not easily believed by fanatics who hear bits and pieces of the puzzle and then stand on the mountain tops yelling with confidence the little bit they know... The trail of evidence Mr. Bowers creates leaves little room for skeptics unless they are willing to do the research to prove him wrong.... which is exactly what he probably would like them to do so that they may also find the truth out for themselves as he did.The only drawback to the book is a horrible editing job which makes it tough reading at moments.Thank you Mr. Bowers! I'm buying several more copies to share with those I love!
5,Outstanding! 10 - Stars for this book!,"I have studied the NWO and many organizaions that are working towards this end. I have been studying this topic for 10-years now. Everything written in this book has been studied by Ken since he was about 14-years of age. I must say that everything written is right in line from all my research. Unfortunately, this book was written before the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks. Ken has a new book coming out, and I hope he talks about the Rockefellers and the Bushes and their plot to attack the World Trade Center. Thanks Ken!"
5,The Perfect Sequal in an Inspiring Series,"Live Like a Jesus Freak - Spend Today as if it Were Your Last, is one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. After reading the first book in the Jesus Freak series I was encouraged by the faith of these Jesus Freaks, but I was also inspired to do more with my faith and to become a Jesus Freak myself. I have always known what it would take to step out and be a Jesus Freak, but this book, ""Live Like a Jesus Freak"" is very intentional in what a person needs to do. It has helped give me focus in being a Freak. I think one of the most enticing aspects of this book is that it uses real life examples from modern history, coupled with real life examples from the Bible. I was so drawn to this book that I read it in its entirety the first weekend that I owned it!"
2,Sound quality of the Sweet Inspirations CD,"I looked for a long time to find a CD with the song titled ""Sweet Inspiration"" by the Sweet Inspirations and I felt very fortunate to find this album available. Unfortunately, the sound quality of the recording is very poor and I was very disappointed when I listened it. You really can't enjoy listening to it at all. I would like to find another source for the song in an effort to get a copy with good sound quality. This one was put together by ""Collectors' Choice Music"" in Itasca, Illinois, but I don't feel as though they did their best efforts with this recording."
4,Sweet Inspirations Have The Beat,"If you really like the 60's music this a good cd.I not only like the feature song on this cd,but also their version of Eddie Floyd's "" Knock On Wood""."
3,Swimming with the Devil Fish,"This book should be retitled to ""Swimming with the Poker Fish and Every other poker player in Europe"". Too little about Devil Fish. Too much about everyone else.Swimming with the Devil Fish: The Colourful Story of the UK's Number 1 Poker Player"
2,Don't drown,"David ""Devilfish"" Ulliott is a poker player, and a great one at that. A hagiography, however, doesn't do much for this sort of being in the modern world. Perhaps the author might have chosen another time to write this legend lived large story: Victorian England might be otherwise appropriate.Don't waste your time reading this; learn to play cards instead."
3,A mix of music that reflects its time,"The Graduate soundtrack is a mix of some lounge-music orchestral highlights, which certainly fit 1967, and several versions of S&G songs, including Mrs. Robinson and The Sounds of Silence. It is fun to listen to the differences in these songs, since they feel like alternate versions, and not repetitious. This is a soundtrack album which features both the pop and instrumental music of its time, although this is probably not for the casual Simon & Garfunkel fan."
3,The sounds were not silent but fuzzy.,I bought this purely for the Simon and Garfunkel. They're songs were spectacular. The other songs were okay but the sound quality of this CD is fuzzy and sounds old. I recommend going to a local music store and getting the original record for the old time sound and the quality to boot. The CD quality of this CD wasn't remastered well at all in my opinion.
2,"Nice for Reliving the Movie, but little else","As other reviewers have said, this is music straight from the film, including a bunch of non-S&G interludes. And don't expect to hear the version of ""Mrs. Robinson"" you know and love. That said, the ""Mrs. Robinson"" you do get can be interesting for a change. And sometimes it's nice to be reminded of the movie without having to watch it. But honestly, this probably isn't an album to buy unless you've already got everything else. Depite ""Scarborough Fair"" and ""The Sound of Silence"", this album rarely gets off of my shelf--it's a pain to have to program my CD player to skip ""On the Strip,"" etc. every time I want to listen to the disc. I hate to be so harsh, but there are better CDs to buy to get the classic S&G songs from the movie."
2,The Graduate sound track,I bought it for the Simon and Garfunkle songs. Should have bought a Simon and Garfunkle cd instead. I don't really care for the rest of the music on the sound track. I doubt I will ever listen to this cd again. want to buy mine?
1,This Is NOT A Simon And Garfunkel Album,"Does NOT contain the hit version of Mrs Robinson. Has two versions of Sound Of Silence and the hit version of Scarborough Fair. If you want S&G, look elsewhere."
3,Excellent Soundtrack,"Forget about the boring Dave Grusin songs and just concentrate on the songs by Simon And Garfunkel, providers of the greatest vocal harmonies on the face of the Earth. The most amazing thing about this album is the instrumental version of ""Scarborough Fair"", which contains the most BEAUTIFUL, HAUNTING notes that ever came from an acoustic guitar. I don't know how Simon does it, but he manages to create an atmosphere of ineffable beauty and enchantment. There's no vocals or bass, just an a capella acoustic guitar reading, so some would call it ""boring"". But those are the people who don't know the meaning of the word ""feeling"".BTW, there are two reasons why I only gave it three stars:a.) The aforementioned, boring Dave Grusin songs.b.) Most of the Simon And Garfunkel songs are either truncated or drastically altered."
1,Mrs. Robinson shortened,"The song Mrs. Robinson, the highlight of this soundtrack, is in shortened version on this soundtrack. Don't waste your money like I did."
2,NEW REMASTERED VERSION AVAILABLE,"In September 2007, a Japanese mini-sleeve version of this title was released, along with a re-issue of all the other S&G; 'sleeve catalog titles.The Japan 'sleeve version of this title is remastered, whereas this CD is a 40-year-old LP-EQ'd master, and sounds terrible.If you are looking to sonically match the ""The Graduate"" with the 2001 S&G; remastered studio albums, the Japan 'sleeve edition is the only remastered version available.Link to the 2007 Japan mini-sleeve remastered version ofThe Graduate."
4,"Oh Yeah, fast moving Sci Fi fun","Absolutely fast paced fun. I might read it again. The action sequences are well drawn and easy to visualize. I might criticize Dietz's plot line getting just a tad thin and unbelieveable toward the end, but because the pace of the book is so fast, most readers won't mind. And seriously, this does have some cool plot twists. If anyone is looking for more complicated or serious plot twists, a SciFi action thriller of two hundred pages probably isn't the place for that.But, if you were looking for a fast paced thriller, this is the book."
3,I always like Dietz's characters.,"Sam is on Earth for a short time, expecting to receive a well earned Bounty. Except the laws have changed and his payment now depends upon his completing a new assignment, for the Imperial Navy. A Navy Captain has disappeared and, unfortunately, after looking over his old records three conclusions have come to the surface. Somehow the Captain has discovered a new, and presumed deadly, weapon from an ancient 'artifact planet'. The second conclusion is that he's gone mad and plans to give the weapon to the Il Ronn. The last piece of irony, the Mad Captain is the same one that had Sam busted out of the Imperial Navy for disobedience of a direct order. Now Sam has been 'ordered' to catch him, or Kill him..."
2,Over priced,"Wig is not included!!! Cheep and not worth the money. I have found much better costumes in the past for half the price. I usually wear a size 6-8 so it does fit fine, but thin material and cheep looking. I am not happy with it but will make it work with a few accesories. I could have done much better if I had constructed my own costume."
4,That girl can BLOW!,"Ms. Tarralyn Ramsey is awesome. She was doing an interview at the radio station in Mobile, AL when I heard her single. I love the song, it is a ""theme song"" for me. THANK YOU Tarralyn!!!!! I love Whitney Houston BUT you better watch out WHITNEY!!!!! Straighten up & flight right"
1,You Definitely Get What You Pay For,"I purchased this mini-mixer as part of my equipment for outdoor weddings. When I plugged in a dynamic mic and a transmitter for a set of wireless speakers with a max 20 watt output, I got nothing. When I called NADY directly, the customer service rep asked me about my setup and replied, ""Well, it should work.""Indeed, but this did not detract from the simple fact that it did NOT work.I returned the product (awaiting refund) and purchased a Behringer Xenyx 502 instead, which has worked splendidly, and has far great input options."
1,Very bad product,"Very bad mixer, I only needed to add a bit of gain to a computer mic input and this wasn't even capable of that, I end up getting the Berhringer 502 and that DOES the jod"
1,I Hate Bad Electronics,"This procuct was crap. I plugged it in, once i set the noisy knobs, I played something through it, had a tiny, distorted sound. I then happened to bump the thing and it sent a loud POP through my sound system. It was then that I packaged it up and returned it. Don't waste your shipping money."
3,Mono vs Stereo,"I know it is a simple mistake but I made it. This is a Mono device, not stereo. I breezed by that in the description so it is my bad but hey, there are pictures all over the page of 1/4"" stereo adapter plugs that people bought along with the mixer. A picture is worth a 1000 words and I just missed it. It is useless to me so I sure hope Amazon stands behind a refund so I can buy a STEREO mixer! BTW, when I DID use it, it was sweet. Quiet and smooth controls. No hum using batteries (does not come with 110 PS). Wish it had a high gain Mic port or one with a two position switch."
4,Excellent Audio Mixer at a low price,"The Nady 4- Channel Mini Mixer performs as expected. I use it to mix the outputs of Mini Disk players, microphones, and laptop comupters. In these applications it performs perfectly. I would have preferred RCA connectors on the inputs so adapters wouldn't be necessary but phono plugs to RCA connectors work just fine."
4,Great for those low-budget projects,"Perfect for those looking for a cheap mixer, and definitely one of the best that you can find for the price. The device is actually slightly different than the one that is pictured, but has the same functionality. One thing that you will want to note is that this device is sensitive to electrical noise in the power lines. So if you plan to plug this device into an outlet, you will want to make sure that you have a regulated 9v power supply. The device can also be powered by a 9 volt battery. I would overall recommend this to those that are looking to start a low-budget podcast, or other next-to-nothing funded audio programs."
4,Good For My Modest Needs - Recommended,"This Nady ""4-Channel Mini Mixer"" is exactly what we needed for bringing in 3 low-end wireless microphones into our video camera that only has one microphone input jack. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Clean Sound, no noise or distortion+ Small Size, 2.5""H x 6""W x 4.5""D+ Battery Powered, takes 9v like my mics so I just replace all of them at the start of a shoot+ Good Quality, the control knobs and connectors all feel well made and ""substantial""Cons -- Case had sharp edge on one corner, which I fixed with a small file in about two minutesMisc -* Also can be used with a 9v power supply, but it is not includedThis was a fairly inexpensive solutions for my modest requirements and I am very pleased with the performance.Recommended!CFH"
4,makes you feel like a pro,"If you want something small, for small partys, but want results at low cost, this is the item.For normal mics, wireless mics, music, the transition controls is sharp."
4,Great gift,Bought it for my friend and she loved it.. I have personally never watched the series but she can't stop watching it
1,Great show but crap product,I bought this a year or so ago and was looking forward to receiving it. Got it promptly but just took a while to get around to writing a review but I finally got annoyed enough to comment.Greek is a fantastic show and this set contains some of my favourite episode but the discs themselves are complete garbage. They are cheaply made and my PC will not read them (except for one which gets a partial read). I just downloaded the episodes over bittorrent in the end rather than pay twice.
3,"I love this show, but I had a defected one","This show is amazing and I was really excited to get it in the mail. However, when I opened the discs, It only have one inside. It was really disappointing to get a defected one when I was really excited about watching it."
3,"Beautiful songs, not different from first album.","I loved Rosie Thomas's first album ""When We Were Small"" and was quite looking forward to this one as well. It's beautiful in many of the same ways -- her sweet voice just washes over you (the lyrics are easy enough to pay attention to OR ignore completely -- despite the opinions of the other reviewers here, I don't think I've distinctly heard the word ""God"" once yet and I've been listening to the CD all day), and the instrumentation is simple and melodic.My biggest complaint is that it is too similar to her first album. I didn't want or expect something wildly different, but I feel as though her style hasn't grown or changed in the year and a half since ""When We Were Small"" came out. If you loved WWWS and are looking for something very similar, you'll love ""Only With Laughter Can You Win"". If you're satisfied with having just one album in this style, then stick with WWWS."
2,talent but missing content,"She has a great voice and her sound in general is amazing. But, there just isn't much going on here. She's very young and that probably has a lot to do with it. She is quite expressive about her religion in a way that is distancing. I like many other artists who write from a place of spirituality like Innocence Mission, Van Morrison, etc. This seems fundamentalist and loses me rather than inspiring me. Many of her themes strike me as adolescent and pretty much played out by so many other people. I have great hopes for her in about 10 years."
2,Another Good Song Writer Finds God and loses it.,"I listned to this disk at a local record store and was becoming mesmerized by the beautiful voice until the word ""God"" made me realize what I was about to buy. Just what we need, another beautiful songwriter who turns her talents away from the very real lives and feelings of living, breathing, people."
5,"What are you so afraid of, Daniel?","Daniel, that upset feeling in your tummy is satan. You need to repent of your evil sensorship ways, or you can just keep living the rest of your life in fear that a christian might actually say something that gets those noodles spinning in your head. I hear hell is hot, dress accordingly.Rosie, Awesome record."
4,Pseudo Intellectualism is overrated,"I find it very sad that an artist is free to express herself in her songs except when it comes to how she feels about God. I was under the impression that being open minded meant being tolerant of other people's views, but apparently from some of the reviews it really just means being intolerant of Christian views. There's nothing wrong with making statements about the world through songs, and it's silly to say the lyrics are simple-minded (which wasn't said directly, but it's implied) just because they don't reflect your own ""introspective"" thoughts.Rosie did a fine job on this album."
3,"Fan for over a decade, dissapointed.","Did I seriously just hear....The sleep mask bitAss Is Haunted bitRock in my shoe jokeIn 2011?I never thought he was the type to rip off his fans by trotting out stale material.I really don't like the new David Cross. His comedy isn't angry, edgy, dark or insightful any more.The first bit on this dvd is an airplane joke.Yeah."
5,An art movie that's a lot more too,"Here is Always Somewhere Else: The Disappearance of Bas Jan Ader is a movie about art that becomes a work of art in it's own right.Having moved to California in the 1960s, Dutch artist Bas Jan Ader vanished in 1975 while attempting to cross the Atlantic alone.Was the prescient conceptual artist motivated by nostalgia, suicide or some mystical search? In pondering these possibilities, Dutch filmmaker Rene Daalder also meditates on the soul of Holland, the lure of the sea and conceptual art.A very personal film that paints an interesting portrait of a very unusual man, Here Is Always Somewhere Else is well made and at times deeply moving. The DVD makers have done a very nice job on the presentation and included some welcome supplemental material as well, making this one well worth a look for fans of art cinema and avant garde moviemaking."
5,You'll Flip over this CD...don't Skip it.,"Ah yes, Skip and Flip, here they are together, two legends as a duo. Skip(Clyde Battin-later with the Byrds and Flying Burrito Brothers) Flip (Gary Paxton, producer of Alley Oop by the Hollywood Argyles, and Monster Mash.) It is a good solid copy of their best stuff from 1959-1960. I real classic. I worked with Skip in Tucson, he was a C & W deejay and a nice guy. He died of Alzheimer's two years ago. Flip has found Jesus and now lives in Branson.Ray Lindstrom, Laughlin, NV"
5,"A poetry of symbol, myth, and physical experience.","In Butterfly Effect, experienced poet Harry Humes draws on the landscape of his native mountains, moving fluidly between the world of physical experience and the world of symbol and myth. Gladiola Man: Each spring he'd plant acres of them,/and not one for sale,/every day weeding, loosening the soil,/fluttering over the spears,/then the big blossoms./He'd kneel, almost invisible/in the rows where we knew/he was talking to them,/sobbing when wind snapped a stem./Each October he'd cut them back./carry the sheaves to the fields' edges,/then dig up the bulbs,/gently life them out,/lay them side by side,/as if he were Leakey at Olduvai Gorge,/standing alone at evening,/fitting together dry silence."
1,Definetly not a teaching tool!!,"Fair in Database explanation. Most of it useless. Does not explain his objects, most fail when loaded. If I had not removed the cd I would return it, must be friends that gave five stars!!"
2,I returned the book.,"I bought this book with high expectations. The author certainly covers some very interesting topics. There is a wealth of code provided that demonstrates how to implement various advanced features. However, the associated text is almost worthless. The vast majority of the written commentary is just that, it is essentially a big comment block for the included code examples. Instead of explaining why the code works as it does and how to implement such features, it is a basic narrative of what the code is doing. I got more out of reading the code and looking things up in a manual than I did actually reading the book. This was not what I was looking for when I bought this book."
4,One of the best VB books on the shelves,"When I first bought the book I didn't know what to expect but upon reading the first two chapters, I was totally delighted. I found some real world examples that I have been able to use right away. It also showed some tips. It is a good book to have for reference. Some VB programming experience is necessary to fully benefit from this book."
2,Sadly missing tracks....!,"I LOVED the movie and was eargerly awaiting the soundtrack to be released, but found that all the great Texas swing music (""Rolling Stone from Texas"" ?) and the tune that was so appropriately played during the salesmen sequence of the movie (""I thought you were my friend"" ?)were both missing from this CD. I am very, very disappointed!!!! I still enjoy all of the orchestration and melodies that are available on this disc, but feel that it would have done the CD more justice if the funny tunes were also included....Very disappointed indeed....:("
2,misunderstood,"Apparently, I am like many others that didn't understand the difference between ""score"" and ""soundtrack"". I really wanted all those funky songs that played throughout the movie. I like orchestra stuff, and this is nice, but not what I wanted."
2,INCOMPLETE! Not all tracks from movie.,"Apparenly the the score and the actual music from the movie are two different things. We just came from this very enjoyable movie and wanted to get the orignial Texas music from the film. However, this offering includes only the orchestral portions."
1,Disappointing soundtrack,"This CD only plays the original music written for the movie. It doesn't contain ""Let Me In"" by the Sensations. It doesn't contain the great country swing songs played throughout the film.The music written by Patrick Doyle is fine but without the other songs, who cares?Great movie. Nice soundtrack, but, incomplete. Like going to a party and finding there's only your sisters to dance with.Don't bother buying this cd..."
3,Different...,If you enjoy different foods-regular salt in a regular shaker-this isn't for you! If you like to spice things ud differently- it may be.
4,This story is good but for adults,"Be careful not to be taken in when you buy a nicely illustreted book.This is not a bedtime story about a brave Indian girl.This is very sad, poignant spine-chiller which should not be read to small, vulnerable children. I bought this book for an adult who is interested in Indian culture and she really liked it."
5,One of my favorites,"Loved this book growing up, and still love it now. A great book to somehow tie into native Americn History if teaching. Also if teaching values a great book to tie in!"
4,Great Gift for the Holistically Minded Dog or Cat Lover,"This beautifully illustrated, colorful, spiralbound hardcover book would make a great gift for the dog or cat lover with an interest in natural remedies for animals. Of course it's nowhere near as thorough as Dr. Schwartz' excellent ""Four Paws, Five Directions,"" but this A-Z guide to dozens of ailments (from abscesses and arthritis to worms and yawning) is nonetheless a solid reference for those who prefer to tackle health problems with nutrition, herbs, homeopathy, and massage instead of drugs and chemical insecticides. Don't expect elaborate treatment plans and diagnosis techniques from this little book -- just safe and natural remedies you can try at home. And yes, Dr. Schwartz does take care to point out when it's a good idea to see a professional for diagnosis/treatment."
2,The Bronte Sisters,"I am disappointed with this documentary. Firstly, the picture quality is not consistently good. Secondly, the content is mostly biographical, which is to be expected, of course, but is overall rather staid. Indeed, the information on the political, industrial, and social developments of the Bronte period is satisfactory, albeit presented in a sullen tone. Lively interviews with scholars, writers, and students of the Bronte works would have introduced a variety of view points on the Bronte sisters. Also, such interviews would have breathed some life into this documentary which relies almost exclusively on a narrator's voice with occasional and somewhat dull dramatizations of journals and novel excerpts. Only the view of the Yorkshire moors and their influence on the Bronte Sisters' work make this documentary worth some attention."
4,'BIG P' & LADY DIANA & PRINCE CHARLES,"ALTHOUGH A BRIEF HIGHLIGHT OF THE EVENT, IT SHOWS THE DESIRE OF THREE PEOPLE TO SERVE SOME CHARITY. THE ENGLISH PEOPLE ENJOYING AND LOVING THE CONCERT IN TORRENTIAL RAIN.. IN THE C.D AND PAVAROTTI'S BIOGRAPHY AS WELL AS LADY DIANA'S OWN WORDS GIVEN IN A POST EVENT INTERVIEW THAT WHEN LUCIANO'S REQUEST TO PRINCE CHARLES TO DEDICATE ARIA FROM MANON 'DONNA NON VIDI MAI' WAS GRANTED, THE AUDIENCE WENT WILD. LADY DIANA (AS LUCIANO CALLS HER. SHE CALLS HIM BIG 'P')WAS ECSTATIC AND LUCIANO NEVER SANG IT BETTER. HE HAD AN EXCELLENT RAPPORT WITH THE ROYAL COUPLE AND WAS EXTREMELY DEVASTATED OVER HER LOSS. LUCIANO WAS THE FIRST ONE REQUESTED TO SING AT HER MASS. HE WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE, AS MR. JOHN DID. EVEN WITH THE FLU LUCIANO ATTENDED HER FUNERAL.THIS IS AN EXCELLENT VIDEO FOR BOTH LUCIANO AND LADY DIANA FANS. YOU SEE HER IN THE RAIN HAIR MESSED AND NOT A CARE AT ALL. THANK YOU LISA & MATT/ VANESSA & NICOLE"
3,Co-Active Coaching - a few insights,"The basics principles of life coaching are presented in the book and I suppose it is a necessary read to obtain various concepts of this emerging profession. I was particularly interested in the concept call Process Coaching which explores the internal experiences of a client and would like to have read more than was presented. I would have liked to read about the boundaries and red flags of this form of coaching which distinguish the need to refer clients to professional counseling vice coaching. All in all, it is a little too 'New Age' for me. I prefer the approaches of Dr. Gary R. Collins, Tony Stoltzfus, or Chris McClusky."
2,Nothing new under the sun ...,"Average book elaborated on nice but not surprising model. I would recommend this to people who want to discover the basics about coaching method. Average theory, models, nice question overview of questions in the end of the book."
3,Not Availalbe on Kindle,I'd just like to make it known that I would purchase this book were this newest version available on Kindle products.
5,Learn to Probe and Listen,"This book has many important facets and should be on the book shelf of anyone who counsels or coaches. The tools and techniques for probing, getting answers and really listening are alone worth the cost of the book."
4,Insightful!,"The theory of co-active coaching that provides the title for this book makes sense: By making the interaction between coach and coachee a relationship of equals, both parties will feel less constrained by pre-assigned roles, and thereby freed to learn from another. Unfortunately, the rest of the book fails to live up to the promise of the initial intriguing, yet common-sense idea. Specifically, the coaching methods and tools described by the authors never progress beyond generalities that basically amount to this: The client already has the answers, the coach just has to bring them out by being curious and creating a safe place where the client can be honest and take risks. However, we [...] do recommend this book on the basis of a few features, like the excellent sample dialogues and illustrative hypothetical examples, which provide simple but valuable lessons to managers, consultants, teachers and all manner of would-be coaches."
2,a lot of words for little information,"I'm very interested in this form of coaching, and am being coached successfully by someone who was trained in this system. I bought it because I was interested in learning it in order to possibly become a coach myself. So I believe in the system, but I found the book difficult to wade through. So many words that the points get buried. Too much to read that just goes on and is not terribly enlightening. I've now read the whole thing and am not sure that I know anything I didn't know before. I think the authors would have benefited from the services of a professional writer who could have done a better job of organizing the material."
4,Good start or refresher course,"This book is an excellently written basics course on coaching. It focus' each of us on the tasks we know are important but sometimes neglect the subtle nature of doing it effectively. For example, listening, intuition, or what level of candor is appropriate. Read it and then keep it as a refresher when ever you feel you are off your coaching game."
2,Too 'warm & fuzzy' for business application,"The first few chapters were a turnoff for myself and a few others who I asked to read some of it. Maybe alright for personal counseling and 'new agey' life coaching, but not for business-focused coaching, for managers and supervisors coaching skills development, and for executive and business coaches. Unfortunate because there are some useful frameworks and tools presented in places in later chapters but even they are mixed with over-soft platitudes."
3,Very Basic,"Reasonably well-written but this book is very very basic. While I can appreciate that coaching can be based in common sense, I really didn't feel this book covered any new territory. For the novice this is a good book."
3,"I purchased this book, CD missing pdf files",I purchased this book and the CD that came with the book is missing the pdf files. Any suggestion who I need to contact?
2,Single Viewpoint,"This may be a product of my incorrect expectations, but the title and subtitle of this book led me to believe it would provide comprehensive elements of the process of coaching and individual development. Instead, I found what I see all too often in training and human resource works: a presentation of a single methodology which the author has developed, which is not very flexible and focuses on the methodology more than the client's results. I think coaching involves processes which are to be flexibly applied depending on individual, environment, other performers, etc. So I'm not a fan on lock-step techniques which we superimpose on everyone as if we're trying to fix equipment. Perhaps with a different title and subtitle, I wouldn't have been expecting something else (and wouldn't have purchased the book). One final comment: I see no indication of validity of the approaches, merely the assertion that the author practices them."
2,Life coaching - not business coaching,"This book presents some useful strategies for life coaching. However, as a leader I was more interested in changing business relations and performance coaching. This book missed the mark. You would need more than just this book to be an effective life coach, and it will not help with other types of coaching, such as performance coaching or mentoring."
4,Great Approach at Coaching with good elaborations and examples.,"Great Approach at Coaching with good elaborations and examples. Co-Active approach is a great guide to Life Coaching and the various core disciplines of Fulfillment, Balance and Process. I believe however there was an opportunity to spend more time on Balance and Process the chapters are too short for such important topics. I would recommend this book for anyone looking to get a good approach at Life Coaching."
2,poor quality,"This item is very poorly made and looks very cheap. You can see and seam very poorly lined up, it is very well hidden in the picture. I was very disappointed in the quality."
1,"Sterling Silver Small Sun and Moon Pendant, Made in Italy. 1/2 in. (12mm) Tall",if your pinky wants to rock a necklace buy this pendant. its soooooooooooooooooooooooo tiny. definitly not worth my 20 buckz... bad buy.
5,PH116 Pastic handle,"Sturdy handles, used them on a 4ft tall x 2ft wide amp rack that weights about 150 lbs, works great"
5,I can only agree,"I'm going to try to avoid saying what has already been said...I first experienced 31 Knots live, at the Fireside Bowl in Chicago. They were on the bill with a few other math rock/indie bands (namely Haymarket Riot), and I had never heard of them before. They took the stage, and with the first song, I was blown away. The musicianship was incredible, and the songs were simultaneously catchy, complex, and thrilling. Not only are these guys exceptional musicians, but they are creating (in my opinion) the most unique, and perhaps the best music in the Indie scene today. And yes, every song on the album is very, very good (my personal favorite being ""We Still Have Legs""). With reviews as glowing as these, give it shot, eh?"
2,good for a collection,this is a interesting movie. Skilled swordfights. There are no hand-to-hand fights. Only weapons. It takes place in up north China. I'd recomend it if you want to expand your collection of chinese movies.
3,Note to Visual Studio users: but no rating yet,"If you are a Microsoft Visual Studio user, beware. This book is written with Borland C++ Builder users in mind, and this fact should be made more clear from the outset. It will be difficult to use for those working on a Visual C++ or Unix environment."
2,"review of Robert Brooks' book by Daniel Duffy, Ph.D.","When I first saw the title I thought that this book would giveme some insights into applying C++ to real financial applications. Thereality was different. The main shortcomings in this book are, in myopinion:1. It is fairly unstructured as it does not deal withhigh-level issues such as mapping financial models to C++ in a cleanway.2. Most of the programs are simnple implementations offinancial models (mostly stochastic ones at that). It would take a lotof work to make them more flexible and reusable (for example, byapplying the Gamma (GOF) design patterns techniques).3. Very littleproper documentation (UML class diagrams would have done thejob).4. The layout can be improved (the publisher should take note)to make it more inviting to read.Daniel Duffy Datasim Education BVAmsterdam, Netherlands..."
4,A great challenge to C++ programmers.,I love this book. It by far exceeds any attempt by other authors who have tried to write a programming book for financial models. I like this book because it was written with a tool that most people do not use and forces you to try compilations on other compilers. One drawback I have is that the source code is not included and that is why there are four stars and not five. If you are going to write a book that has software the examples have to be easily available. I just don't get it why these financial guys have such a hard time with this.
4,Needed this on trip to Europe,"We recently went to Austria and the Czech Republic and needed this converter set for my wife's hairdryer, curling iron, and our kids' Nintendo DS - the smaller adapter plugs (purchased separately) worked fine for cameras, cell phones, and IPod's. The set is a bit heavy, but handy to have for foreign travel."
4,"Study the Luminaria album, then get this.","One star off for bad video quality. Nevertheless, it's a must for any fan of the album. See my review of Luminaria. Yet another example of the disgraceful paradox which is the American music industry: artists of this stature play small venues in relative obscurity while tripe earns millions."
5,A must have for all Ian Moore fans,"As a long time fan of Ian Moore, I highly recommend this DVD. I picked it up at his show in Phoenix, and have watched it numerous times. He's not performing with the full band, so it feels like a much more intimate show. It really showcases his talent for singing and playing music that touches your soul. I've seen him in concert at least a dozen times. This DVD is almost (but not quite) as good as being at one of his shows. Nothing beats hearing him live. It also features a few songs from a show with his full band. A great buy!"
3,not bad for what it is....,"I do understand the other reviewers complaint about this being a accustic DVD without really saying it on it anywhere. However, that does not make it a bad DVD. Although to be honest I have only listened to it twice and that should tell you something. I love accustic music, however, this show really does drag more than it should. I saw him live in St. Louis and the live performance was MUCH better. Worth a chance if you are a big fan -- otherwise spend your money on some of his CD's first."
1,Illegal lifestyle,"This is a book that simply tries to glorify an illegal lifestyle. I read it a while back and it made me want to scream that women can be so stupid as to think that they only way they can get to heaven is by a man. The only way you can get to heaven is through Jesus Christ, not some man who has 40 wives.Dumb, Dumb, Dumb."
1,YAWN!,"I could barely get through this yawn of a book. I've read almost every book on polygamy, from both sides of the issue and this is the worst by far. These women are either lying to themselves or their husbands dictated their stories for them. Ladies, if you ever read this review, please get help & get out!"
4,Voices in Harmony Book Review,"This book was not what expected, however one of the things that impressed me and that I really like about the book is the history it provides of plural marriage - it's roots, the reasons the church denounced it, and more."
4,Good fun for rainy or cold days,"This set is great. Lots of stuff: 15 tubs of clay, 12 clay cutters, 2 tools, a roller, and a play mat. Plenty of stuff for fun creative play. The clay is reusable and unlike playdoh, does NOT dry out. Your kids can leave their creations out on display for a while, then go back and make something new."
3,Harmless Drivel,"I like John Huston and Humphrey Bogart both very well. I guess that is why I am disappointed with this film. There is nothing particularly wrong with it but neither is there anything right. It is mindless, mildly amusing entertainment.Bogart plays one of several men on his way to Africa to swindle the locals out of Uranium concessions. He is the nicest of his bunch which is not saying much. They are to travel by ship and, on the same ship, is a young English couple. She falls for Bogey and Bogey's wife seems to have an interest in the husband but things start to fall apart when the husband learns of the uranium plot. The other bad guys realize that they are going to have to get him out of the way. This involves abandoned ships, being help prisoner by Arabs and a host of other inconveniences. Eventually, things work out.As I said, there is nothing really wrong with this film. Its just not as great as I expected. It is completely ordinary."
5,like total best,lukes song &quot;where them girl's at&quot; is the best dance song ever. its great to dance to and just fun to listen to. this CD is a blast to listen to.
3,Total Fun,"As much as anyone can be offended by Luke, they would also have to admit that his music has a great dance beat, and it's just plain fun. There's no reason that you can't have fun with a CD and it still be total crap."
4,Good book,"Good for the six-month old I bought it for. Very colorfuland the ""handle and beads"" are a great addition. We loveit."
5,one of the best for kids!,"This was my favorite book as a child, having received it in 1974. I read it many times and years later shared it with my own children. It was one that they asked for many times. Little Popcorn wants to be a fire house dog so bad and works so hard to get his spots. The little white hero finally gets them, just like a real fire house dog!"
5,Henry's lost album,"Henry Vestine, originally with Frank Zappa and then joining Canned Heat for their debut album in 1967, recorded this whilst on tour of Australia in 1981. Canned Heat's legendary front man, Bob Hite had recently died whilst performing at the Palomino and the tour was, according to Peter Noble the producer, charged with emotion.The tapes were lost for years until recently discovered in an office move and sent to the U.S. for remastering. This album is one of only two solo Albums Henry made and is a valuable piece of Blues and Boogie history to any Canned Heat fan of that time or present."
4,Murder at Lake Tomahawk,"This is a remarkably entertaining book. Inserted in the story line is some very informative scientifc information that painlessly makes the narrative more real while educating the reader. It is refreshing to find a new author who is not trapped in recreating the same old formula driven page turner. The characters are life like and recognizable. The story moves swiftly and the conclusion, while not totally a surprise, holds your attention until the last page. This is excellent reading for the beach, a long airplane ride or a rainy weekend. I look forward to his next book."
5,The spilled milk of human kindness,"Nick cave is perhaps the most brilliant rock poet of our day. I was less fond of Nocturama than previous releases mainly due to relatively weak lyrics. These two discs are as lyrically deep as they are musically. Nick is really a modern straggler from the romantic period. His words look as beautiful on paper as they do in song. The sound of these 2 cds is very mature...not to mean it's not still raw and experimental at times. Two very different albums in one package. Abattoir Blues simply rocks! This is powerful stuff. The only song I can't really digest is ""Breathless"". It rather amused me the first time I heard it, but now it's grown to be more of an annoyance. I don't think the reggae tinge works. That's just me though. I've seen others point to ""The Lyre of Orpheus"" and ""The Fable of the Brown Ape"" as weak points and those are favorites of mine. But everyone seems to agree that it's a damn fine release. Cheers Nick!"
2,pass this one by,"I bought this when it came out and thought ""It's Nick Cave, how bad can it be?"" Well, it CAN be bad and it is. The packaging was beautiful- I love good packaging- it's a silkscreened fabric box-- but the contents...well, maybe I didn't give it enough of a listen but I couldn't get through it. It had choirs and all kinds of schmaltz that I did not see coming from Mr. Cave. I guess finding Christ was not good for him artistically. Maybe if I picked it up again and gave it another shot, but when I hear a choir, I generally have to think they've hit the ""We are the World"" point creatively. The only choir I can tolerate, generally, are real ones singing actual classical music, or the Polyphonic Spree. Other than that, I don't want to hear it."
4,Some Very Moving Tracks on this Album,"'The Fable of the Brown Ape' is haunting and sticks with you for a long time, reminiscent of 'The Weeping Song'. 'Supernaturally' is very romantic, and rocks. 'Get Ready for Love' I didn't like at first but then I changed my mind after a while. Same with 'O Children'. This album definitely benefits from repeat listenings. If you already like Nick Cave you will like this. If you haven't listened to him yet buy 'Best of'."
5,monumental,"a masterpiece that covers the gamut and leaves you profoundly transformed. I was certainly expecting greatness, but this thing blows me away. To offer so much wonderful music for a reasonable price is brilliant. The beautiful art work and packaging add to the overall value of this buy. Primarily, it's the music that counts; and this magnificent one just took the title (in my list) for best work of 2004 by anyone!"
5,This is so beautiful music,"I just love Nick Cave and he totally rocks with this double album. I like ""Abattoir Blues"" because it's noisy and very temperamental, but ""The Lyre of Orpheus"" is great in a mellow but playful kind of way. Cave has confirmed himself as an ultimate poet and The Bad Seeds are perfect instrumentalists. So, if you want to hear very emotional, intelligent, but unusual music, BUY THIS and you won't regret it."
1,Another piece of genius.....NOT!,"This game is just sad. Capcom thinks they can just throw in a character from a COMPLETELY different game, and expect to roll in some more dough. [Loud buzzer ringing] Wrong. Viewtiful Dante just doesn't have that ring to it. So, bottom line. Pick up the Gamecube version and leave this one in the dust."
5,Best Game Nobody Knows Of,"The creativity in this game is off of the charts. I was thinking about whether or not this was a 2d or 3d game but now I think it borders on 4-dimensional because you can manipulate time. Heck, let's just call it 5-dimensional with the 5th dimension being creativity! The great thing is that you can find this game in used stores for less than fifteen bucks! Why can't more games be like this? Totally worth buying."
5,Kick ass game!,"well worth buying this game, if you like to smoke the crazy tabaccy, this game will keep you focus during the fights in slow mow."
5,Great Game Bring Back Old Gameplay Mechanics,"Viewtiful Joe is played like how Double Dragon, Battle Toads, and etc. was like. Cool how Capcom brought back the old things and even made it cooler. In this game you will play as Joe as he is sucked into the world movie, and has to stop evil while rescuing his lover"
1,YUCK!,If you've have ever smelled the smell of crushed ants- that is what the smell of this stuff reminds me of. Im used to the sugar free mocha syrup they use as starbucks and this was no where near! It was so gross and I will not buy it again. I've tried the sugar free vanilla and caramel and they were both good but this is not chocolate-like. very artificial tasting.
2,I didn't care for it...,"I tried some of this chocolate sugar free syrup in my coffee, I have to say I didn't think it did anything for it...couldn't tell it was chocolate tasting at all...Maybe some find this syrup good, but just for my personal opinion, I was not impressed and won't be buying any more ..."
2,Careful,"Be very careful when purchasing this product, it may not be what you think it is. I thought it was the chocolate syrup that most coffee shops use for their cafe mocha. After tasting this stuff in my mocha, I'm quite thoroughly convinced that is not the case. What I want, and I think what many other shoppers probably want, is called ""Torani Chocolate Sauce,"" not ""Tonani Chocolate Syrup."""
3,"Not as fun as previous work, but still a shaker","It is fun, but lacks the musical pizzazzzz and humor that Fatal Mambo lovers enjoyed. Still it is a nice recording to shake to."
1,Pitiful excuse for a snail. Not one of Folkmanis' better designs.,"The Folkmanis Garden Snail is far superior in every way to this puppet.This ""snail"" looks like a ""mutated rabbit"" with green crud in its mouth. The eyes are in the wrong place and its facial expressions are limited.I have ordered a number of the Folkmanis Garden Snail puppets since their initial release. I recently ordered three more and recieved three of the ""mutated rabbit"" style snail puppets instead. They were mistakenly labled as Garden Snail puppets.The snail puppet being reviewed does not pair well with books and teaching tools relating to snails. This snail is well, NOT a snail.I do not recommend this pitiful puppet."
5,Recommended Viewing For All Serious Actors,"Until Lorrie Hull's 2-hour videotape ""The Method"" was produced, the only place one could hope to see the ""method"" in practice was in a reputable ""method"" acting workshop (and those are rare), or as a student at the Strasberg Institute, where tapes of Lee Strasberg teaching are kept under lock and key for use by a select few. Lorrie Hull has created an invaluable teaching tool for actors, directors and teachers which is also easily understood by anyone in the general public with an interest in ""how actors do what they do"". To read Ms. Hull's best selling book ""Strasberg's Method As Taught by Lorrie Hull"" is to understand the ""method"". To view this dynamic video is to experience it. No theatre library is complete without the inclusion of this video."
4,Surprisingly good,"I had heard some of these songs when I was a kid and through the years tended to forget about them or dismiss them as gag tunes. After listening to this entire album multiple times with a 5 year old (it's one of his favorites) I have had to reassess this album. In short, it's really pretty good. The chipmunk songs are cute and for some odd reason do not become annoying. Some of the other songs are often better, especially the ""beat"" version of The Night Before Christmas. I had never heard it before, but it is a very good, very creative, and quite memorable version of that song."
3,Tight in Heel,"I've been an avid long distance runner for over 30 years, and have always bought only Adidas shoes. In my oppinion Addidas is the best. I did not like the tight area where the back of your achilles rest, it's too tight causing irritation to the back of the achilles.I found this out after a long run on the first day of wearing this shoe. I felt since I ran 12 miles in them and sweated them up, I now couldn't return them. I will improvise and slightly doctor up this problem. I hope Addidas is not losing their edge after all these years."
4,Good resource for parents and teachers,"The purpose behind this series is commendable. It's to give children the educational background necessary to get along in the world.My children LOVE it when I read stories to them out of these books.I also find the history, science, and math sections to be good guidelines for what my children should be learning. It's not a complete curriculum, but it's a good start."
5,Gradeschool help,I ordered this book not only to get some ideas to help my 6 year old grandson keep up over the summer but also a 6 year old that I help with reading. This book has excellant suggestions on how to keep a child's interests focused along with letting the parent know what will likely be expected of the child as he progresses into first grade. It is essential that the child not lose the knowledge gained in kdg. ( some statistics claim children lose as much as 40% of their knowledge over the summer) if it is not reinforced. I feel this book has been written to prevent that from happening!
4,Nice book: All in one for grade 1,"Has most of the things my kid's school has in grade 1.We have been using it for few months now.They could have arranged the chapters in better way, but that simply is my perception.I am overall happy with the book."
3,Very basic,Basic overview. It helped a bit and is nice to have. The music section was helpful as we hadn't yet started music for homeschool.
1,If my son can finish and understand what this book covered..,"If my son can finish this book and understand what this book covered, I don't know what he can learned in the next 6 years. Besides the math is way too simple. The other materials are way to complicate and too difficult for 1st grader. My son attended a private school. The school mostly follow this book for the teaching materials.When other kids in other schools learning living, non-living objects and air, water, solid objects, my son was learning digestive system, nervous system and that Maya worship natural gods.You tell me, smart parents, do you really learned those stuff in your first grade?"
1,Poor set up,"I do not like this book. I like the idea of it--but I don't like it this way. It seems poorly set up and not what I expected. I bought it as a homeschooler to compare what kids would learn it public school, but I quickly sold it again."
2,Whole series is a bit off.,"As a former teacher and current homeschooler, I find that much of the material in the early levels of this series are not appropriate for the grade levels indicated. I use the books as references but not usually at the grade indicated by the title of the book. The history sections are especially inappropriate. Children at these early grade levels do not have enough background knowledge (i.e., comprehension of the passage of time and the geography of the earth in relation to their own place in it) to fully understand the material presented. Thus, they are very unlikely to retain the knowledge or to apply it meaningfully to other areas of study. Parents trying to stick to these grade levels are bound to be frustrated."
4,Good looking sunglasses,I bought these sunglasses for my husband to keep in his Vette. He likes them and appreciates that they are original C6 Corvette sunglasses but in my opinion they do not look the price you pay for them. But as long as he's happy I'm fine with it.
1,Well worth the money??????,"""Well worth the money."" This is a quote from the previous reviewer. Depends on how you look at it. Personally I think that having to fork out the sum $ 150,00 for a book of some 250 pages, a new book that is, not some rare bibliophile first edition, or a copy signed by Stalin, is a bit steep. I could even go one better and say that this price is bl**dy ridiculous, no matter how interesting the subject is!$ 150,00I!! Go sit on it, mr. Maslov!. Geez! I mean: couldn't you get some money form some corrupt superrich Russian oligarch, who then would support the arts instead of blowing all his money on some English Premier League soccer team? That would be better than robbing us poor Eastern Front afficionados. $ 150,00..tsk, honestly, I ask you......."
2,"No variation in the ""games""","My 5 yr old started this book of Number Games 1-70 after finishing the Numbers 1-30 book. I wish I had looked at it more closely. As someone else said, it's the same 2 types of games throughout the entire book. Gets very boring very quickly even with different pictures on each page. One side of the page has a connect the number (which my son will do with no problem) and the other side is color by number which he hates. I would have thought a book of games would have been more varied. As it was, it was pretty disappointing for the money.And, as with all the Kumon books we've purchased, the pages don't tear out. The weight of the pages is pretty heavy so it's hard to keep the book open well without breaking the spine. I finally got my box cutter and sliced the pages out."
2,lacked focus and depth,"I love thieves and rogue chars so I thought I would love this book. I was a fan of the first 3 books in the Elminster Series and I don't like short stories so Elminster in Hell wasn't my style but that was forgivable. This book had a habit of going ADD on story lines of chars that didn't matter, the thief daughter wasn't wrote about near enough and what chapters one did get about her were generally cluttered with parts about characters not her or action scenes that gave no depth of personality. The book started off strong enough that I was to invested not to finish it but the last half was a chore with little reward. It was interesting to note that a naked woman made an appearance somewhere in almost every chapter in some nonchalant way. Overall, not a terrible book but it would of been better served if it focused on the daughter more. I hope to read more about her in the future but this book isn't one I'd seriously recommend to anyone but the most die hard Elminster fans."
1,Wrong book.,"The book I received was in good condition, with some writing inside visibly erased. But the book was a cloth hard bound copy - definitely not leather!"
4,Enjoyable,She has a different writing style than other authors. I enjoyed the book as much as the other two. I'd recommend to my friends.
2,Blues Dancing,"I was very disappointed with this novel and found it very hard to believe that the author had come to this point to write something that was so cliche. More distressing than that was her inability to develop her characters; there was so much more that could have been said about Verdi, Rowe and Johnson. Kitt and Posie,however were well structured characters. This book was so unlike her other very great works. It was as though someone was forcing her to write a new book or else her ""public might forget about her""."
3,"good, but not quite as good as the other 2 books","I LOVE Ms Whetstone writing, but I was a little disappointed in this one, but still give 3 stars"
4,Soulful Stirrings,"I was captivated by the descriptive words and metaphors that Diane uses in Blues Dancing. She uses lyrical, pivoting words that enhance the imagination, and stir the story around in your mind. 'Blues Dancing' is the best writing and use of words that I've read in a long time. This novel is the balance between the overly descriptive novels, and the 'tell a tale' novels. This is the first novel that I've read by Diane, and I was thoroughly impressed. Her characters were so well developed and described, that I could actually feel them, their dilemas, their pain, and their longing. Reading 'Blues Dancing' was like listening to a slow, sultry jazz song dripping with soulful love and palpatating emotions."
2,Blues Dancing,"I heard this book reviewed on NPR and came home and ordered it immediately. When it arrived, I started reading it, again immediately, and couldn't put it down. Insightful book on the times and what could and did go wrong with many of us in that era. The book moves along and is very well written and the characters were vivid. High recommend it to those who lived through that era and to those who want to learn more about this period."
2,Almost didn't make it through this one,"I try to give every book I start a fare shake and I had to fight myself to finish this one. I found the story interesting (once I was done) but slow, and I could tell what was going to happen before it did."
5,Blues Dancing - Excellent,"This is an excellent tale of young relationship that eventually matured into adult relationship - with lots of twists and turns in between. One of the great lessons in this story is how one should not look to his/her mate to complete themselves. One should feel totally complete and happy alone, before they attempt to make someone else happy. Diane McKinney-Whetstone is an excellent writer. I can always see the scenes in my mind as I read her stories."
3,LACKING SOMETHING,While this book kept my attention and I was left feeling like all the characters were not fully developed. I was left wondering what Johnson did for those twenty years. Left wondering why Kitt had such serious issues with men. I was entralled with Tumbling and frankly a little diappointed in this but nevertheless I will continue to read books by Diane McKinney-Whetstone.
5,Difficult to Put Down,"I found this wonderful tale of lovers who met in college, very difficult to put down. Ms. Whetstone is a wonderful writer and her prose is like poetry to me. I loved the way she weaved us (readers) into the web of addiction, strong love ties, and strength on both of the characters. I liked the secondary characters as well. This is a strong tale! You won't want to put this book down. Why? The characters get into your system, your life, and you won't want to let them go. You 'll be addicted to their trials and tribulations and you'll want them to conquer any demons that they are facing. You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll be there in the moment for them.Ms. Whetstone, thanks for bringing this story to light for us. Blues Dancing is the NUMBER #1 book for me for 2000! I couldn't put it down.Be Blessed, and keep writing quality fiction."
2,Is this realy jerry wallace?,"there is some good songs, but the recordings are terrible. it sounds like the engineer did pay no mind to the recording seeds when duplicating the master. this is not jerry wallace of the early 60's"
4,beautiful collection of some of most inspiring words ever,"I love this man. I have every one of his books. It's amazing how I gain a new perspective each time I read a particular passage from his books. What's interesting ,though, is that there are so many parallels between Dr. Dyers writings and the writings of the Baha'i Faith, yet it always amazes me that he never referres to the works of this unifying world faith. The Baha'i Faith is profoundly rich with writings on spiritual truths.. and it was all revealed over 150 years ago. Nevertheless, I especially enjoyed this book of all his books (well actually Manifest Your Destiny was awesome too!).. I'll always be a Dyer junkie!"
5,A HIGHER CONSCIOUS AWARENESS!,"Congratulations once again Dr Dyer for bringing valuable information and a new awareness into so many peoples lives. I recently attended a workshop you held in San Diego and found the experience to be nothing short of amazing! I have always been a fan of yours and would like to see you work more on stage with mediums like James Van Praagh, Jenny Crawford and John Edwards. It seems that you all have a lot in common in awakening peoples God consicousness."
3,Otay book,"I go back to this book from time to time because of the way it names its chapters. For instance, my girlfriend just broke up with me and I'm so angry I never want to speak to her again - I would go to the chapter ""Forgiveness"" and it really helps to calm me down. Some bad points are the poems; do people really understand them? I don't! I just jump right to the discussion part. The summary at the end of each chapter don't really summarize the chapter and sometimes adds new thoughts from the author! I am also not satisfied with the spiritual or god explanation because I'm not religious. For anyone thinking of buying this book, definitely get the hard cover, I did, and happily, I was able to remove the cheesy cover and have just a nice plain blue cover."
1,Ridiculous and pathetic,"This work sets a new low in the exploration of the nonsensical (and fallacious) ""All religions teach the same thing"" idea. It's empty headed blather, full of misrepresentation, error and confusion. I cannot speak to the Zen, Hindu and some other references, but the discussion of the Christian, Jewish and Moslem traditions are utterly without merit. If you're looking for a cheap emotional high typical of the so-called ""new age"" genre, this book is for you. If you want real insight and thoughtful, scholarly interpretation and comparison, look elsewhere. At best this book is a waste of time, at worst it's spiritual cyanide. Dyer got off to such a good start with ""Erroneous Zones"", but his material since then continues to plumb new depths of pseudo-spiritual tripe."
2,"I didn't like it, maybe you do?!","It depends if you are interested in reading about important people from the past and what they have teached the world. I just ignored that, because I wanted to know Dyer his ideas, although it was the main reason of writing this book for Dyer. Anywayz I consider it's a summary and/or rehash of all his ealier books and/ or ideas. Next to it almost every page is about God this and God that and I'm not that religious, so it quite bothered me. The main thing in this book is: mediate, do yoga or something like that, don't be afraid to be yourself and do not let anyone manipulate you etc. Just borrow it from someone like I did and get the info you want and need...."
2,i see an error,"in one of the texts, he used E.E. CUMMINGS, instead of e.e. cummings. what a fool. plus he does advertise more of his works in the book which take away from the original meaning. I find many parts of this book to have irrelevant entries in it. I could have written better information than this wise@55."
1,Doesn't Make Sense,"The rules of yesterday do not work for my generation. The World Trade Center has ruined all hope, and changes everything. Why bother to live day by day if it can all go away in one minute? n The ancient widsom is not about bombs which did not exist at that time."
2,Less Ego please.,"Although Mr. Dyer's selection of great people and their work has a lot to offer, his ego spoiled the scene. He inserts numerous plugs for his other products, and too many examples from his own life. Perhaps reading the book would make it easier to avoid these distractions, but when listening to the CD, they are unavoidable. The overall effect is that of sitting down to a nice meal, only to discover a large hair in the dish after severl bites. Disappointing."
5,Very insightful,"When I read this book, I can almost always relate to what the author is saying. Each section can be applied to just about anyone, I think, and the man is very insightful :)"
3,Good Words Make Good Deeds,"The selections by Dyer are inspiring. Not all of them, and not his explanations. But for the most part, it is good reading, and good food for thought."
4,This is a different Wayne Dyer,"I attended a lecture last year given by Dr. Dyer; and, I have to say that I was impressed. I had read some of his early self-help books. While they were okay for what they were, I found them lacking depth. This was a clearly deeper and more spiritual man. So, I bought the book. It was likewise deeper and more spiritual than those early works. Dyer presents topics and relevant quotes from sages of the ages. He then presents his ideas, observations, and sometimes examples from his own life as they relate to a given topic.The book is thoughtful and well written. It didn't change my life. I'd already done that. I did, however, find the book delightful and spirit confirming."
3,Good reading if you can pick and choose,"I prefer this kind of `self-help' book to those that purport to teach you, step by step, how to achieve what you want because it takes you to the classic texts and lets you pull from them what you will. Dyer's notes are helpful though I don't always agree with his take: his new-age-Hindi-Buddhist-spiritualist beliefs are always present which you may or may not always like (I'm not always on board with his ideas). Like a lot of new-age writers Dyer stretches his sources sometimes - many of the authors he quotes were unabashedly Christian and would not agree with his conclusions. Still, though, thoughtful readers can put what they will from the text. Good reading."
4,Bringing poetry down to earth,"This is an enjoyable collection of poetry with plain, everyday explanations and interpretations. However, in his attempt to be plain, some complexities and intellectual aspects remain hidden. The author expresses some unconventional ideas that I simply disregarded. Overall, the selection and presentation make it an inspiring book."
5,One of the Best,"I am a children's book fanatic and I LOVE this book. It has been a big favorite in our family and is even my secret weapon for long flights and car trips with my babies. For an interesting, interactive baby book, I highly recommend this one."
1,"Hah, tons of garbage rap, none of the electro from the film.","DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS.The first Blade film was distinguished by its bad ass songs that complimented the crazy fight scenes and tech-Vampire lifestyle. However, this soundtrack seems to be an excuse of an OST, licensing a bunch of trash rap songs - MOST OF WHICH WERE NOT EVEN IN THE FILM, rather than pay the Electronica artists for the songs that were actually used in the movie. Then you wonder why people pirate music, because the music industry is full of complete idiots who have zero standards and just pump out trash discs time and again.Hit the internet for the tunes you want from this film, the poster with the highest rating here did a SUPERB job in identifying the actual songs in the films. You can buy a lot of them from digital stores but the very rare tracks (Bang Wa Cherry - Chin Chin), you might have a much harder time acquiring.Good luck hunting for your face-melting tech tunes!"
3,Where is the Techno?,"All right, I enjoyed the movie and I gave the CD three stars for Confusion and the two other Techno-that was really in the movie songs.I'm hurt that they did not spearate the two Inspired and From the movie.Does anyone know, when the credits role in the movie at the end what THREE sings are they playing.. becuase I really want those THREE.Thanks and happy hunting."
3,Where are the tracks from the movie?,i have 2 Shonen Knife cds.......the japanese punk bunnies.....which song did they use on Blade movie?...can't find it..any help is good....guess i gotta buy dvd and freeze frame it to find anything worth while..coz it's not on the album they are pushin here
2,What the ????,"I was looking for the hard driving beats that were present throughout this awesome Vampire movie. What I recieved was a not so good imitation of the movie. Tracks 11-15 were very good, but the first part I was wondering where this these came from. I would not recommed this cd to anyone."
3,One track is worth the whole CD!,"This CD just goes to show that rap stars need to eat too! I don't know how these rap cuts got into the picture, much less low quality ones, but track 12 - the New Order track, made the purchace worth it! If you love techno/rave, don't chance a separate CD being put out by New Order-get it while the gettin's good!"
3,phatty-boom-batty beats,"i bought this cd for 1 reason and 1 reason only: the awesome ""new order"" track!!!!! it is quite an amazing track that is straight for the clubs (for those who don't know its the track featured in the trailer, and in the vampire club scene). although i like hip-hop, the rap tracks on this cd sucked and had no place on it. too bad you can't find the ""new order"" track anywhere else. oh well."
4,What is the name of that tune??????,I listened to the cd and thought it was pretty class especially because it has the new order remix on it which is a classic example of original acid/techno!!!!!!! But the tune it did not have on it is the drum and bass song that deakin frost listens to when he is downloading stuff off that computer and the lead vampire walks in and starts talking to him...
3,"HORRIBLE RAP, CRAZY RAVE\TECHNO","The couldn't even put in good rap like DMX, I guess all they could afford was bad rappers. The rave music is hot! The confusion mix is crazy."
1,"""Inspired By"" doesn't cut it as a ""Movie Soundtrack""","I think it is a pretty low deed to pass of a cd as a ""soundtrack"" when it only contains 4 tracks that are actually in the movie (4/17 songs credited on the titles).I was looking for that ""killer"" techno track from the club/rave scene, but I would not buy this CD for just one track.'nuff said"
1,Band Info From The Movie,"Just an FYI - The Japanese band that was playing, i.e. the women's song - is by Japanese ""punkers""/ Heavy Metal band Shonen Knife.Fans are fanatics - enjoy!Oh, and I didn't buy the CD after seeing that most of the stuff I liked in the film wasn't on the CD. Thanks again to the film and music industry for trying to rip off the poor consumer - everyone should support the efforts to make MP3 kill the Recording industry - money to the musicians and nothing to those b*stards!"
1,"Saw the movie, cool tunes, esp. at the credits, CD stunk!","Movie had some awesome ""rave""/techno tunes in it, some played during the credits, but when I bought the CD it has mostly rap songs on it that not only don't deserve to be on the soundtrack but aren't even good rap!!! Not worth it!"
2,New Order track would be the only bet.,If you like rap then this is for you. The only track I liked was the New Order one. If your looking for the techno tracks they ain't here.
1,Whats the last track playin in the credits?,What is the last track that is played when the credits end?
2,wuz 'up wid all da morons lookin' fer da BOM!,"Why is it that every time I get near techno music, I am encountered by morons who can't spell? Techno is perhaps the most innovative thing to happen to music since Elvis picked up a guitar, and yet it seems to attract losers to it's scene! The CD (and the movie for that matter) are great, if you are 12. As long as techno fans continue to act as immature as is displayed in the previous posts, the Industry will continue to feed them juvenille crap."
3,must research to find techno muzik,"rent or buy DVD to find the music in the credits...see my reviews dated july 31, 1999"
2,Where Were The Tracks From The Film??,"I really loved the movie BLADE, and was dying to get the soundtrack. In fact, the day after I saw the movie, I trudged to three different stores to find it! I get home, put it on...and there's a lot of rap!(?) Don't get me wrong, rap is ok, but I expected ALL the techno tracks from the movie to be on the CD, not just a few. There are two non-movie tracks I've come to enjoy a lot, but there are what, two or three techno songs from the movie? ""Confusion"" and ""Playing With Lightning""? If it would've had all the techno from the movie, and just more techno in general, I'd have given the CD 5 stars!"
5,Smooth glide between hard rap and techno grooves,"Unless you're a fan of BOTH hard core rap and techno then this album isn't for you. Fresh deep bass grooves mark the beginning of the album, with Mystikal and KRS-One sliding hard lyrics on some of the better tracks. Fans of ""Top 40"" rap like Puff or Mase would find the first 10 tracks of poor quality, but for true fans of rap the only way to describe this album is ""phat""! The techno cuts are definite rave material, and they're also excellent with their innovative beats and sampling. Overall, this album is very impressive, but stay away from it if you're looking for pure techno or ""Top 40"" rap songs."
3,"Music, where is it?","Ok, I did some reesearch. I believe the three songs at the end are Soleil, Eclipse and Fearless preformed by Solitaire. Now my thing is that I can not find any CD that these are on.. is anyone else looking for these songs too?"
3,Shonen Knife?,"Shonen Knife did music for this film (they aren't, alas, on the CD), but they did not perform the music in the club scene. The Japanese schoolgirl band is called Bang Wa Cherry, and the song is ""Chin Chin."" Information about Bang Wa Cherry, like do they have an album, seems hard to find. But if you search Shonen Knife MP3s, you'll find copies of ""Chin Chin"" misidentified as ""Ah Singapore"" (the track from the movie which was actually by Shonen Knife)."
3,Pop song sung in bar,"I have some information to those who want info about that song that was sung in the movie when Blade crashed the bar.it's called ""Chin,Chin""composed by Damien Wagnersung by Bang Wa Cherry & DJ Junethey were the people singing it in the bar."
3,I got it.,"I did some searching and with the help of others I've found the three songs at the end with the credits. But just to talk about the CD.. a nice combo of Rap and Techno.. I enjoy both. For the three song at the end are- (in order heard on tape)#1- "" Go get on it""by Southside ReverbCD: Breakneck#2 "" Ni Ten Ichi Ryu ""by Photek CD: Mtv: Mtv Amp or Ni Ten Ichi Ryu #3 "" Rattle the fear ""by Spirit FirechildCD: Bottom Heavy White Trash GangsI hope this helps and I would like to thank all of you for your help."
2,WHAT is this?????,"Everyone I have talked to who saw the movie RAVED about the *TECHNO* sound track. After I saw it, I went right out and got it. MAN was i disapointed what up with this RAP?? This movie has a TECHNO sound. Not an Ice T gonna busta cap in you sound. TECHNO should have been what was on the cd even if what was in the movie wasn't enough for a cd how about extra tracks by the same artists. That I can accept. This blatant attempt to trick people into buying this crap is disgusting. I kinda wondered when i saw the ""Music from and inspired by the movie"" on the jewl case. Oh well. at least track 12 rocks."
2,Soundtrack huh?,"Ok lets start from the beginning. The movie was good. The music in the movie was good. So where is the music that's actually from the movie, on this soundtrack? In my opinion, the two best songs are the mix of ""Confusion"" by New Order, which was an 80s synth-pop group, but now supposedly does techno, and ""Playing with Lightning"" by Expansion Union, another good techno group. Secondly, there was no rap in the movie. So where did the rap on this ""soundtrack"" come from. I'm not a fan of rap/hip hop or whatever it's called. So i got really angry when i saw that instead of this CD being a great techno compilation, it was just another rap-lovers' CD. Techno fans, the only good things you'll find here are the few techno songs at the end. But you can thank the guy that made this ""soundtrack"" and left out all the good stuff so he could replace it with crap music, that wasn't even in the movie, for that. I gave it two stars for the two good songs."
2,More Techno less rap please,"I was very dissapointed after buying this cd.Then why give it two stars only for one great song on it and that's track 12 by New Order that's played at the begining of the film.Other then that one song,the soundtrack is pure garbage."
2,What happened?,"Blade was an excellent movie (one of my favorites) and I was very intrigued by the music. However, this disc does not appear to contain any of the songs (like the rave scene at the start) that I liked. What happened? And why? The rap songs did not stick out in the movie yet they seem to dominate the CD. How disappointing."
2,the japanese girls,"the girls who were in the vampiric night club are called shonen knife and the song's name is ""ah singapore""."
3,Hey I love my techno!!!,"I gave this CD three stars because it was a very good CD, but I could have done without the rap. Besides track 12 is just too cool.BTW I'm not sure if the song that is playing while the computer is decoding the Book is the same that Frost is listening to, if it is it's done by Photek and the song is ""Ni Ten Ichi Ryu (Two Swords Technique)""."
3,it looks like a great CD,does anyone know if the techno song from the begining of BLADE is on the CD im to afraid to buy because i only like that song and the one in the Bar. Please email me if you have a any information
1,Drat!!!! Foiled Again!,"Much like many of the other reviews, I found this disk to be full of music that I didn't hear in the movie... I thought the point of a movie soundtrack was to compile all of the cool music highlighted in a film and make it easily accesible to the consumer... Boy was I wrong. .... I too returned the disk."
1,"Heavy on the "" Inspired by"" part.",The last few songs starting with # 12 are decent as far as electronic go. The first eleven rap tracks are alright if you are into that but I wouldnt have bought the album if these were the tunes I heard in the movie. I returned the CD.
2,Maybe I wasn't watching the movie as closely as I thought,"Where did all this rap come from? I don't remember it in the movie... I remember quite a lot of electronica, but not most of the music thats on here. I *do* remember the music from the club in the beginning... first song we hear in the movie is... 12th on the CD??? Its an odd mix of rap and electronic, being rather light on the electronica and extremely heavy on the rap. Maybe I should watch the movie again, but this isn't what I heard the first time."
2,i found the SOLITAIRE tracks,"after much searching of german websites i discovered that SOLITAITE cut an album in 1994 called Fearless on Recycle or Die/Eye Q records...these labels are no longer producing music....but if you look for these record labels...u will find SOLITAIRE-Fearless w/ the song awakening, tribes, soleil,eclipse...all i can say is do your research."
2,Half of this music did not appear in the movie.,"Having seen Blade, I really fell in love with the sound track they had going. It fit the action scenes wonderfully (especially the opening rave scene), and had more energy than you could hold in.Having bought the CD, did I really see the same movie? The first ten tracks are unlistenable tough-guy gangsta rap. The tone of the movie shows through on the later 5 tracks, including a phenomenal New Order mix.The later 3rd of the CD is really really good, the first 2/3 I can't stand. 2 stars, and shame on the person who blew this opportunity to make something really shine."
1,Where's the beef?,"I don't often write reviews, but this CD really [upset] me. This isn't even close to a soundtrack album. It's 95% rap. The awesome techno that made the film rock is almost completely missing. Do yourself a favor and find the real tunes on other CDs. This one's a waste of money."
2,This is the Blade soundtrack?,"I was going to get this, until I listened to the samples and read the reviews. I loved the Techno music in the film, but why is the CD mostly rap instead? I'm very dissapointed, now that this is out I won't get to hear a *real* Blade soundtrack."
2,A gross misrepresentation of the films music,"I guess there should have been two volumes of music for this movie, what was in the movie and what was not. The movie was okay but I really liked the music. when I bought the soundtrack the bulk of it was rap. I was expecting a lot more techno. be careful because if you dont like rap you won't like this cd."
2,"Same Comment, Different Guy","Its officially a consensus that this disc needed more techno from the movie, please at least list where I might find the actual techno tracks other than the 4 on the CD, the other comments pretty much cover the situation, the whole reason I came to the site in the first place is to find the TECHNO tracks, I saw the movie and it was killer bought the disc and found myself screwed, deny me not the music I desire, I don't want to waste more money."
4,11-15 trax the best,"Like everyone else said, where did all the techno from the movie go in the soundtrack? Damn the Record industry, go MP3. Download Winamp and download songs from the internet and enjoy the music you want to hear."
2,Disapointing if your into trance,I thought the movie was so awsome. I really thought the vampire underground rave was the best PUMP PANEL-CONFUSION is so driving. I was so bummed out when I purchased the cd un-aware that most of the techno goodies were missing I was so ready to get my groove on and grab my glow sticks an all. :( (Sigh)and Im not into rap at all so I was devastated...and I couldnt return it either cus I lost the recipt so ...( ~_~ )
1,What is this?,"Not what I expected at all!!! The movie Blade ( one the best movies of this decade ) had a techno theme to it. Rap was just not the way to go!!! If your looking for something that was in the movie like techno I REALLY RECOMMEND LOOKING UP ""HIGHER STATE OF CONSIOUSNESS"" which was in the movie!!!"
3,"great techno, lousy rap","great techno, lousy rap. If people are looking for the music wich is played while deacon is in the archives then you should check out the first track from the great cd from ""Source direct"" called ""Exorcise the demons"" and u will have found that song."
2,This CD does not live up to the movie!!!!!!!!!,"The movie was everything I expected, and then some. I couldn't wait to get the CD. The songs I liked in the movie, weren't even on the CD. I thought it would be more Techno. Don't get me wrong. There are 3 songs on this CD that kick! I didn't think it was worth the money. For the person who was buying this CD for the Techno, you may want to borrow it from someone who already has it."
1,what movie is this from?!,"just like the rest i was entranced by the soundtrack. i was especially fascinated by the japanese ""school girls"" and their song. does anybody know who the @@@@ they were?! i tried to catch it in the credits but couldn't. why the @@@@ did they pull this b.s. with the rap on the cd? if it had been part of the film i would understand but there was no freaking connection!!!!!"
2,Preemy ejac!,"As the grind lit through my head like a wildfirre, I hunted down the Soundtrack like Vampyre prey, all to discover that the Jenre, which was so well portrayed in the film, of clubs that _I_ travel coast to coast to find, and dance within, from Limelight (old,) Manhattan to Kontrol Faktory/Perversion Hollyweird, I thought someone had actually put my Cyberpunk/Russian/Yakuza sound down in one CD... I was going to be a happy ""sucker""... So... Why all the RAP?!?!?? I mean, if it were a PART of the film, fine, but RETCH!!! Picasso released as a paint by numbers... Darkchildiku Yakuza Cyberpunk Dozo... Du Rusky BAMnHP... NOT! I just feel sorry for the people who CANT get music fom Japan, Russia, and other places like myself... I suppose they thought it was an ethnic thing... (sigh) Well, I say, rerelease it..."
3,ok,"I liked the music, very ""cyberpunk"" and captures the mood of the film. I am dissappointed that they did not include a song that was sung in the movie. It was that rap song sung by two young japanese girls in the japanese bar that Blade infiltrated before finding all of the sacred texts of the vampires.I found that song different and was curious to hear the whole thing, but it wasn't in the soundtrack..."
3,I`m the same opinion like Megaman,"I only listen to tracks 10,11,12,13,15. And sometimes to 4. To the Music Fan from Kingston: Do you mean the scene, when the vampires are dancing in the blood??. The track is ""Confusion"" by New Order. (The best track on cd). Bye!!"
1,How can this CD rate an average of three stars???????,"I really liked the music that was played on the trailers for the film. After watching the movie, which I liked, I thought I wanted the sound track, but I'm not sure from the samples that the very song that is techno is even on the CD. The song is the one that is played when all the vampires are dancing in their club waiting for the kill right before Blade comes to the rescue. Does anyone know where I can find that music piece or if it is one the CD. I don't want to buy it if it isn't and I don't care for rap so I'm not even sure I want t spend for the whole CD."
1,how do you want it/california love,"I was very disappointed in this transaction. The product description said ""hit em up"", but when i received it ""hit em up"" was not on the cd!!! ;-("
5,Best Rap Single of All Time ?,"If there's a better rap single on the market, I don't know of it. Every song on here is CLASSIC. This is a perfect cd for someone just getting into 2pac, as it has 3 songs released as singles from ""all eyes on me"", plus ""Hit Em Up,"" which is one of 2pac's best songs. All four of these tracks are features on the greatest hits LP. There is no low-point in the cd. The version of ""California Love"" is the original, which is much better than the remix on All Eyes On Me. This makes a great cd for someone just getting into 2pac, someone who isn't a hardcore fan but likes his songs on the radio, or anyone just getting into 2pac. Perfect single, no filler."
1,Lame...,"I didn't see the movie, so I picked up the book. Let me just say, the dialog is hardly ""hip"" and there is no suspense or detail at all. The character's nicknames and the things they do are so lame. I'm going to see the movie, but so far, the book is horrendous."
4,nice,cut gift for my nephew great price its a diffrent kind of gift any toddler will love n has stood the test of time very happy
2,disappointed in product,This product is cheep. The zippers are not easy to use and it is very small. Pictures posted are deceiving.
3,"Nice and portable, but small","This is a nice set for travel and I like how it all packs up, but the dinosaurs are very small, so beware if small children are in the house."
2,Do not buy mini ZipBins - they are not worth the money.,I have purchased other ZipBins in the past and loved them. They are durable and my boys enjoy playing with them and carrying around their various toys or legos in them. The mini sized ZipBin is very flimsy and does not lay flat to play on - not to mention it holds very little. You are much better off paying more and getting the medium or large size.
4,smaller than shown in pictures - misleading,"the boy in the pictures must be very small, as this looked to be much bigger in the pictures. I would go with the medium/classic size instead. Was looking for something easy to travel with, but this is really the size of a laptop."
3,Small but cute!,"It is pretty small, I got it for a two year old so I got bigger dinosaurs to go in it....only about the size of a lunch box but such a cool concept it un zips to make a play mat."
5,Reality for little kids,"This book was a birthday gift for our small naturally born daughter on the eve of our adoption of an older child from a foreign land.Unlike most other readily available adoption titles for little kids (with the exception of Let's Talk About Adoption), this book shows real photos of real babies, kids, birthparents and adoptive parents.It explains in very simple terms why some parents cannot care for their children, and would choose to place them for adoption. It also shows photographs of real adoptive parents who cannot bear children of their own, who desperately want children.And it introduces the idea that adults have often been adopted too. One child in this book tells his teacher that he was adopted, and the teacher confides that she too was adopted as a child.Altogether this book provides a great introduction to the beauty of adoption as a way to build a family. Being a family means loving one another no matter what. Alyssa A. Lappen"
4,Good for adoptees and their friends,"I like this book for my pre-schooler, who is now learning about her adoption. It introduces different kids who are adopted, so it helps her see that there are a lot of kids with this experience. It has some silly things that appeal to her sense of humor (like a lizard named Fingers) and some serious things like why a birthmother might choose adoption.The birthmother is young and it does imply that the reason is because birthparents are young, which is a drawback to this story.One other positive thing is that it is appropriate to give to friends who might be curious about adoption, even though they are adopted themselves. We have given this book to my daughter's friends as well as her school because it's general enough to be interesting to everyone."
2,didn't care for it,"I didn't care for this book at all. We have purchased several children's adoption books including Jamie Lee Curtis's book and ""Why was I adopted"" and were very pleased. But this one I was just not comfortable with. Can't really put my finger on the exact reason, but we returned it immediately."
4,Expressive handmade Books,I really like this book. it is well laid out and the instructions are easy to follow. The variety of projects will keep me busy for a long time.
4,"No First-Rank Classic, But Worthwhile","ROMA CITTA LIBERA, something of a fizzle in its day and virtually unseen for over fifty years, has turned up in one of No Share's spiffy DVD transfers, providing many pleasures for fans of 40's Italian film. Filled with too many formula picture touches to really qualify as neorealism, ROMA nevertheless features many familiar faces from the great movies of the period -- de Sica and Valentina Cortese, for starters. The actors, writers, director, cinematographer and composer (you'll recognize Rota's principal song here from its reuse in Fellini) may have all achieved greater glory elsewhere, but ROMA's wry wit and wistful humanity cast a melancholy spell that's frequently pure magic. If this picture piques your interest, chances are you'll find it quite enjoyable."
5,Perfect,Quick processing and shipping and the item is exactly what is to be expected from the product description. Sturdy build and has enough extra room to fit any small peripherals.
2,Cheap Materials,"I was looking for the Case Logic case which wasn't available. I have owned many Case Logic cases in the past and have never been disappointed by them. But being this was the only choice i found for a faceplate case, i decided to give it a gamble. The service and shipping were great but the quality of the product is less than expected. The material is a cheap vinyl material that will probably not hold up to heat or cold. The nylon used by Case Logic is much better and lasts a long time. All i can say for this, is its better than nothing."
2,Buyer be ware,"The case is fine, actually it's really great. My problem is that the vendor sent me two when I only ordered one. They did allow me to return it but charged me restocking fee. You have to decide if you want to deal with these guys. I would sure see if someone else has this product."
3,Struggling to get through it,"After several months, I'm not quite halfway through the book, because just about anything else is more interesting and will supersede this on my reading list. That's probably not Princeton's fault. I could use a guide about one-third the length of this book.Less conscientious readers would probably get a lot out of this by skipping many sections, but the college aid process is entirely new to me, so I'm skipping precious little.The review also points out (quite correctly, I'm sure) that the parent's relationship with the financial aid officer is by nature--civil, respectful, cordial--but adversarial. The whole thought that I'll have to arrange the financial facts of my family to my best advantage is, for reasons that are difficult to explain, discouraging."
3,The Pacifist are stirring up trouble,"Anybody who know ron goularts writing style, knows that his stories are full of off beat humor. This is not one of his better stories but is ok."
2,My review,"Okay, first off the manga followed the game, not the anime. So all of the people who've only seen the anime might not follow this.Second off, once again Viz horribaly dubbs this English version, using the (also horribaly dubbed) anime names, cheap dialouge in place of bad words, and bulky English sound effects.All in all, story line was good, fight scenes were good, and once again Viz destrys the good name of a good series.You can see this in ZOIDS, Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, One Peice, and other Viz liscenced mangas. In my opinion, messing up the names, dialouge, and sound effects is as bad as printing completely blank pages. Whenever Viz decides to change this, I'll be willing to comply."
5,Great angel book! I highly reccommend it.,Angel power is for me what a driver's manual is for my car. I didn't know how to access the amazing power of the nine choirs of angels before I read this book. I also was unaware of the pitfalls that angel power can eliminate from daily life. Too bad I didn't know about this sooner! Great read. Great information.
4,Where is Deborah Blando??,the album is wonderful but where is that magical voice of Deborah Blando like in the album Suave Suave??
5,As sensual as Sensual Sensual,"Perhaps their best work yet, next to Sensual Sensual. Ambient, emotive and erotic. I like..."
3,NOT ONE OF THEIR BEST,"If you are a B tribe fan, listen to the whole CD BEFORE committing to a purchase.What more can I say?"
4,Flying Blind - eye opening!,"Smerconish says what he thinks, which happens to usually be consistent with what I think and experience. It is a fast read, which reminds us that we DO need to keep paying attention and that political correctness is a disease and that common sense is not as common as it needs to be!"
1,1st is the Worst!,"We've all heard it: 1st is the worst! SO TRUE! The first season of this show was horrendous. Seriously! Things only got GOOD on this show when the girls started to grow up and when Aunt Becky (Summerland's Lori Loughlin) came along. Plus, there was some cross-dressing and gay humor in a few episodes. Just don't buy the worst season! It is evil! Plus, everyone was ugly and stupid in the 1st season and the jokes weren't funny. Wait until season 3 or 4. Then it might get better. As for now...no."
1,worst show ever....,I cant believe all the good reviews for this horrible show. If I had a family that lame and Bob Saget as my dad I would jump off a cliff.The story lines are such a bore and so predictible.I would rather watch paint dry.
5,WISH IT WOULD BE RELEASED PRIOR TO YEAR END...,"BUT THANK GOODNESS THIS IS FINALLY COMING OUT ON DVD...WE CAN HAVE THE GIRLS WATCH IN THEIR OWN ROOM....WE'RE WATCHING SO MANY RERUNS, WE'RE GOING BUGGY....GREAT SHOW...THANK GOODNESS THERE ARE STILL SOME SHOWS FIT FOR KIDS' VIEWING."
5,great dvd set,I recently purchased 2 sets of these dvds. One set for my cousin who is 10 and my daughter who is 4 and they both loved them. I was really glad to see these out. My daughter would watch them on TV and we always hoped that it would come out on dvd. If you have someeone in your family who likes Full House then this is a great gift at a great price and I have never seen them in stores anywhere.
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY on this one,"I agree with the other reviews here about the content of this DVD -- it's great! Finally a DVD that our entire family can watch together. Never any fighting or extended suspense, and plenty of humor that appeals to adults. BUT. . .The DVD sounds CRAPPY. I have a home theater setup, and this is the ONLY DVD in my extensive collection that routes ALL the sound to the center channel only and cuts out the low frequencies. VERY disappointing. Maybe this won't be an issue for you if you listen through the TV speaker, but really, this DVD on my system sounds HORRIBLY tinny.If bad sound annoys you, do what I now do. Full House is now on heavy syndication rotation on Nickelodeon and other cable channels. Just set the DVR/TIVO/VCR or what have you to record and timeshift the Full House episodes (I can currently catch two different ones per night). The sound on playback is fine, and 1000% better than the DVD. So until they remedy their sound problem, save your money."
5,finally on dvd,"Around a year ago, I signed an online petition to see if this and ""Miami Vice"" could get released on dvd. The company listened to the fans I suppose:) . I remember watching this show every Friday night when I was a little kid. Nick at Nite as well as the Family Channel(now ABC Family) played reruns of the show; however it is nice to have the show in a cohesive season instead of watching an episode from 1987 back to back with one from 1993.Full House is a sitcom the whole family can watch."
5,Awesome show!,My kids loved this show when they were younger so what better way to enjoy it all the time! My youngest daughter was ecstatic that she got it in her stocking.
5,Amazing Amazing Amazing,Full House is so amazing. Michelle[Mary-kate Olsen and Ashley Olsen] are so cute. I watch it every single day
3,honestopinion,i loved these shows on tv and assumed they were the same on dvd however iwatched the first two discs and was shocked to discover that the shows on dvd had some mild language that was not televised. it was nothing much but enough that i am returning this product
1,Full House,"I used to watch Full House, but I realized how stupid it was. It's supposed to be a 'family' show, but no family's that perfect! I mean, every epispde ends with a hug and a recorded 'awww'. Mary Kate and Ashley, who play Michelle, couldn't act when they were babies and still can't. The jokes are recycled. You can only hear a jibe about Jesse's hair and Joey's imiturity so many times. If you're looking for a funny show to buy the DVD for, get the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, which is great. And if you really are a Full House fan, just watch the reruns on Nick@Nite and ABC Family. DO NOT waste your money on this DVD. I haven't bought it, and I won't."
1,I wish I could give it a lower score,"Full House was awful. It was cornier than ""Leave it to Beaver"" and its characters were as hackneyed as ""Brady Bunch."" I mean, come on, the big star was Bob Saget. Save your money for a much better TV series."
5,greatest dvd this whole year,Im 21 and I don't care who knows. I love this show and I think it's really good. The 2nd season should be coming out soon I hope. Only time will tell. I was waiting for this dvd for a long time. I got it it's first day it came out to stores. I love every second. Buy it. That's all I gotta say.
5,Super million stars for this show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This show is the most awsomest show in the world! What are ya'll talking about?!?!Stephine is the funniest.I love this show!
1,What junk,"This show is absolute junk. It isn't even funny. It has tons of lame jokes (Such as ""You got it dude!"" and ""Cut it out!"" with its stupid hand motions). The show is about 3 girls who live with 3 men. Sounds like a gay situation, dosen't it? Well, anyway, the one man, Danny, is a TV talk show host, who is a clean freak. The other man is Jesse, a motorcycler and Elvis freak. And the other man (I mean child!) is an immature stand-up comedian who isn't funny. And then their are the children, who are annoying.I recall in one eposide, Stephanie crashes a car (Or bulldozer? I don't remember) into the house. But, of course, being the unrealistic show it is, Danny says to Stephanie, ""You can replace walls, but you can't replace daughters."" And it all ends with a hug. How unrealistic. None of the things in this show aren't even remotely realistic. I am 12 and I think this show has jokes only 7-9 year olds would find funny. And if an adult watches it, you have problems."
2,Full House (First Season),"**Jenny- San Francisco, CAI bought the Full House DVD 2 times at store when I play the movie it doesn't have sound when I play the movie. I return it back to the store.My sister order the Full House DVD it also doesn't have sound to so she return it back to Colubia House.I think they should remake the Full House DVD and check the DVD before the movie hits in store.Jenny"
1,Crap!,"Don't you guys realize that this show is unreal? It could NEVER happen. Not in a million years. Sisters do NOT get along the Stephanie, DJ and Michelle.Michelle- sure, they are popular. but they are annoying. they say the lamest things like ""You got it dude!""Stephanie- Not as bad, but still very annoying.DJ- She is a goody goody who couldnt act for her lifeJoey- NOT FUNNY! I cant believe he thinks he is so funny, when really, no one ever laughs. The only ones who laugh either have sad lives or deaf.Jesse- If he is a rocker, who dosent he do drugs or drink?Danny- He is a neat freak, who is very unrealistic.Overall, I hate this show. And I tihnk it is sad that adults like this show, when not even kids I know can stand it."
1,If this is what society deems as funny........,"Wow, then my idea of humor is like, sooooo last season, LOL!Back to my normal self, this show is pure garbage. I bought this for my sister as a birthday present, and we watched some stuff together. It's like, really corny and cheesy. There are two things wrong with this show:1.) Let's get real....three men. One house. San Francisco. Yeah, I thought so.2.) Everything's always happy, for God's sakes! There's always something bad and than they all go, ""It's OK, I love you anyway."" No family could possibly be that happy."
5,My Fave!,"Well,ever since last year in 03,i watched Full House.And grew to love D.J. and Stephanie and many others.They are great and it is a awesome show.And the others are great too.This show is a fine example of family values.Pride.Courage.And the act of being there."
1,Huh,This show is complete crap I mean they all end with a hug and always overreact to the problems they have. I would have to be drunk to buy season 2. My sisters watch this show and Jesse is a big freak about his hair Danny is a clean freak and Joey is a comedian that isn't even funny and I mean dude get a life. Three guys that live in the same house and two of them will probably be a gay couple. This show sucks it is not worth the money.
4,Full House Season 1,"This item was purchased as a Christmas gift, so I wouldn't know anything about the condition or the quality of the product. I do know that Full House ran for a long time."
4,really good,"I really loved full house when i was growing up as they were around my age as i am from Australia i thought it was so cool to watch kids on the other side of the world on TV, the only let down on the DVD was there wasn't any behind the scenes features which almost all do now other than that i thought is a really great idea to bring out the seasons i am really looking forward to the rest to come out."
4,A very nice dvd but it could be better,The dvd and the shows are great! But I wish they had more extras
5,Loves Full House,My daughter loves the entire series. She can't get enough of the show. That tells you everything!
4,The Start of a Legend,"I am shocked that there were any bad reviews for such a terrific show. It has good humor, realistic situations, and just enough cuteness to make anyone smile. I will admit that the first season pales in comparison to the later years but honestly, how many other sitcoms lasted for 8 full seasons? The shows managed to have a clear order to them but also each episode had the ability to stand alone. Watching how this show progressed and changed over the years if probably the most interesting thing for me."
5,Full house first sesion,"The early years of full house, never released here in the UK, why i have no idea? This is a very enjoyable series to watch fun for all the family.Set in san francisco, we get to see the early years of the olsen twins sharing the role of baby michelle tanner.Three lovely girls being brought up by three guys who at first dont know the first thing about looking after them, and it is this that makes it more enjoyable.Watching the events from changing their first nappy to helping ditch school every minute is enjoyable and the kids make it more hilarious every episode.Not only is this a lovely edition to any mary kate and ashley fan s collection, it comes in a lovely presentation box . Value for money is outstanding!"
5,cool dudes,"All are very cool espically JOHN STAMOS.I even like DANNY and JOEY. MICHELLE, STAPHNIE and dj were too good.FULL HOUSE is the best t.v show.I love every person of the show,espically Jesse.Convey my regards to Jesse,i'm a great fan of him and the others.all you guys have done a great job by acting so naturnaly.BYE then, take care.JOVITA."
5,Crisp and precise!,This series of selections highlights the precision of the Royal Marines Band. Counterpoints are punctuations of precision craftsmanship while the overall sound is rich and full. The range of these musicians will have you on your feet or at least tapping a toe to keep pace.
4,Another Hillarious Song by Cledus,"Funny man Cledus T. Judd has done it again with this hillarious parody of Kenny Chesney's song ""She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy."" It refers to the recent arrests of Kenny Chesney and Tim McGraw and even funnier if you know something about the ""incident."" In the song, Cledus (singing as if he were Kenny Chesney) gets a cellmate whose feelings he does not reciprocate. Very funny!"
2,Crap,"This was not a 14k gold plated necklace. One reviewer said that she would wear it out where ever, it was that nice. I disagree completely. It was fine for the Halloween costume I bought it for, but no way would I wear it anywhere else."
4,Aztec Gold,"Product recieved promptly; I intend to place the medallion into a sturdy, gold-like rim which is attached to a heavier chain to display it more appropriately. I hope to wear it aboard the Lady Washington this summer. (the ship appears as the Interceptor in the first POTC film.) Thanks!"
3,"it was exactly what he wanted, but chain broke right away.","It was just what he wanted (he loves the movies) but chain broke right away. Fixable, but still...."
3,meh,"I'm kinda disgusted that this cost me $40. It doesn't even look like the one in the picture, its a uniform fake gold color, looks kinda like metal, and sounds like it, but is as light as cheap plastic.However, it is a decent replica (except for the back which is some weird Aztec symbol). I will wear it in public, but I seriously question the chain's durability. For as much as it cost though I will wear it a lot, those who love the movie will recognize it quickly I would think, but those who aren't that into it will most likely give me odd looks as I'm not the type to have anything to do with skulls. And I must admit, if you don't recognize what it represents it is a rather gruesome image. Honestly, not worth the money unless you are a huge fan of the movies."
3,watch out,"There seems to be several kinds of the coin all made by master replica. the one I bought dose not have antique finish like i would love it to have. but i can pretend its new, even though id like it just like the movie. and the chain is so thin."
3,A classic of the field.,"This book is one of the major references for people in the scientific end of the semiconductor field. It is a good reference for practicing scientists in the semiconductor and applied solid-state physics fields. It contains good treatments of most of the topics expected in a semiconductor physics book. Surprisingly, its readability remains high for a work of this breadth. This is not a mainstream book for dilettantes."
4,A complete and readable reference that could use updating.,"The Physics of Semiconductor Devices is a classic in the field, containing all the necessary knowledge as of 1981. The classic devices (diodes, transistors, microwave devices) are covered clearly and exhaustively. The book is lacking in its treatment of semiconductor heterostructures, which are key to modern devices but were not nearly as central two decades ago. One hopes that a 3rd edition is in the works."
5,"Great for Intermediate and Advanced, Not for Beginners","This is a great book for intermediate and advanced physics of semiconductor devices. I would caution against the use of of the term 'physics', though, because it usually restricts the physics aspect to energy band diagrams. There is some talk of E-k digrams, but assumes prior exposure to them. There are better books for the physics and E-k diagrams. It does a great job describing many different types of advanced semiconductor devices and their applications. For the beginner, though, I recommend Pierret's ""Semiconductor Device Fundamentals"". It's not as current as Sze, but gives you a much better foundation of pn junctions, BJTs, and MOSFETs."
2,More patchwork than book!,"This is not a good book to study semiconductor devices.In the reality it is a patchwork of uncorrelated articles about various devices lacking unity of vision and clearness in the exposition.Very often it happened to me to use other 2 or 3 other books only to understand Sze .And the author is extremely fond of making reference to final formulas without explaining the logical developement used.And now the book is dated too:so do not buy this book,try instead ""Device eletronics for integrated circuits"" by Muller and Kamins which is advanced and well conceived too!"
5,Best text book for semiconductors,"Thanks to Amazon, I got the book in two days. It is one of the most complete reference book for solid state and for electrical engimeering applications. I need it for a project on semiconductor physics concepts."
2,Cut and paste job. This is not a text book.,"Any college graduate can cut and paste published papers and create a massive ""reference"" work. There is no proof that the person who ""wrote"" this book is actually Dr. Sze. (Compare this with Feynman's ""Lectures on Physics"" where every paragraph is screaming ""Mr. Feynman wrote this."") No insights are shared, there is nothing in the way the material is summarized which says Dr Sze paid attention to making a unified presentation. Some sections are horrible, while some sections are reasonably readable. It's no excuse to say that this is not a text book but a reference work."
4,Indeed better than it sounds,"I'm glad I have the chance to voice my opinion. David Barber does an excellent job finding and presenting mostly musical quotations. In some cases, he lists quotes that have nothing to do with music except that a musician said it, and I found that annoying. Yes, he does use some sarcasm, but he also uses puns and plays on words and some of them had me in fits of laughter. If you like David Barber, you will like this book. If you don't like his sense of humor, you won't."
1,Depressing,Sarcasim is not a kind of humor I enjoy. Most of the quotes were sarcastic and demeaning of music and musicians. I was looking for quotes that were amusing without being derogatory.
5,An Incredible Story--and much more,"In this beautifully written and very moving book, Ms. Hartocollis not only tells the story of a young woman from Finland who, through her character, talent, and personality affected many children--and others--in a short time; she also, with a talent that many novelists would envy, captures inexorable human conflicts that, despite good instincts, can poison even the closest relationships. Anyone who cares about education, anyone who wants to be a teacher, and most of all, anyone who's looking for a great story about the most interesting people in the world--real people--should not miss this book."
4,A compelling tale,"This book tells its engaging story with charm and unexpected depth. I picked it up in the wee hours when I couldn't sleep, and couldn't put it down. I wanted to find out what happened to the vibrant Scandinavian music teacher with secret vulnerabilities, and to her mixed-up crew of Bronx public school pupils, whose hidden strengths were tested on a trip to her island home. Poignant and funny, insightful about human psychology, it also contains useful background about the NYC public schools. A great gift for teachers, would-be teachers and their parents -- or anybody who wants a good read about real people."
2,Disappointed,I purchased this curette after my CND Curette I've used for 9 years disappeared and has been discontinued. The ends on this curette are larger than what I was used to and much larger than they look in the picture. All depends on what your used to using. Or if you are gonna use this alot. I am a nail technician so this is something I need with every client. Needless to say I wasn't happy and returned it. Also paid for 1 day shipping and it was late. Return was easy with no problems.
3,Critique of guide to Benthic Chlorophyta and Phaeophyta,"Donald Kapraun has made a valuable contribution to the identification of the benthic marine Chlorophyta and Phaeophyta on the Carolina coasts. The book includes keys, descriptions, pictures and drawings, a glossary, and an extensive bibliography of cited literature. This book is the second in a series on benthic marine algae. It is printed on journal quality paper, however the pictures of whole mount specimens are not as helpful as the diagrams included in the first volume completed on the Rhodophyta. In spite of this drawback, the book is still a very valuable tool and should be included in the library of all serious phycologists."
3,"3.5 stars, so-so","This is the back story of Odysseus' wife Penelope, who was left at home for 20 years while her husband had all kinds of adventures.Atwood's Penelope is a mind-numbingly boring heroine. She's a passive daughter, a passive wife , a passive mother, a passive queen,... Which could all be very understandable - the story is set in the antiqiuty after all - had Penelope had a single interesting thought during her entire narrative. Unfortunately, that isn't the case.What saves this novel is the story of Penelope's 12 handmaidens. It is told in a saparate voice, sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking, often both simultaniously, and always fascinating and fresh.All in all a mixed reading experience."
2,A Lackluster Protagonist for a Lakluster Story,"Disappointing. My hope was for a retelling of The Odyssey that would give a richer, more intriguing and unique viewpoint of Penelope and her maids over the twenty-year span of Odysseus' absence. What it instead ends up being is a boring recounting of Penelope crying, filling up the time doing nothing, or being sarcastic about life now that she inhabits the Underworld. She speaks in far too modern a tone, and sounds much more like a feminist mouthpiece than anything else. The book also assumes knowledge of the Odyssey--granted, it is a retelling of sorts, but should be enjoyable without me puzzling over certain names or events. And Penelope herself is, in a word, boring. The redeeming factor of the book lie in the interludes, songs and poems and small scenes featuring Penelope's maids acting as a Greek chorus. They are beautiful, clever, and occasionally terribly moving or even funny. They provide the only relief throughout an otherwise dragging story."
2,Derivative and Shallow,"If I had never read anything by the enormously original Dorothy Parker or seen Woody Allen's ""Mighty Aphrodite,"" I may have been impressed with this book. But I was not impressed. It had the all snarky tone with absolutely none of the side-splitting humor or heartbreaking depth of emotion I so adore in Dorothy Parker and Woody Allen's works.I appreceiate the idea of Atwood's re-telling the myth from Penelope's point of view, as well as her attempt to go the feminist, moral route...but it was executed in an obvious, silly, and derivative way.If you want a light book to read at the beach, this will do...I have heard her other novels could be modern classics, so I am reluctant to criticize Atwood as a writer on the whole until I read more of her work. I am, however, disappointed that I didn't choose one of her novels as my introduction to Atwood over this title."
3,"Um, kinda boring compared to her other novels.","The Penelopiad was .. well, rather boring and nothing like her unique and bizarre book, The Handmaid's Tale, which I thought was quite excellent."
2,I finished the book,"I am not sure if I don't care for M Atwood's writing style or what, but I found Penelope to be unsympathetic and whinny at best. I couldn't wait for the book to be over. I did like the use of the chorus. That was an interesting device."
4,Entertaining Read,"I was required to read this book for a Senior Seminar class, and I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed it! It was a short, quick read but had a lot of depth, humor, and complexity. If you're a fan of the Odyssey-or even if you're not-this is a book to read."
2,A little bit disappointing,I was really not crazy about this book. I've read the Iliad and Odyssey several times throughout high school and college and that background knowledge didn't make that big of a difference. It is a very short read and there are some cute/funny parts but overall I probably wouldn't read it again.
1,Atwood Can't Match Homer,"It is an interesting premise, a fictional account of a collateral character in the Odyssey, but she gets bogged down in foolish concerns and makes too many errors in continuity and historical context - like Penelope gazing through a window smeared from the smoke of countless fires. The Greeks didn't have windows until long after Odysseus was laid to rest."
3,Too Much Distance,"I'm never sure if I like Atwood. I like her stories, but there's something in her style I find off putting. I would have liked this book to be longer instead of a mad dash through the Iliad and Odyssey years. If Atwood wanted me to feel for the characters in a new light, it would have been nice to have the time to get to know them along the way."
3,Finally a woman's POV,"The story of Odysseus told from Penelope's perspective. Nice. The book starts out strong, I was drawn in immediately and the first 100 pages flew by in a flash, but right around where the Trojan war ends I started to find it tiresome. And the little chorus interludes freaked me out a little sometimes. But other than that, good book. Definitely a worthwhile read."
5,Chorus of the twelve maids,"The absolute best book in the modern myths series, Atwood has set out to tell the story of Penelope and Odysseus and, according to the book's introduction, ""fill the holes"" in the original Odyssey. The important nuance of Atwood's haunting retelling is the echoing melancholy of the twelve hanged maids - a much more important element than the simple juxtaposition of this story to the original male frame. Atwood's telling is not so simple - which makes this book a rare delight, well worth a second reading."
4,The Maids Made the Story,"Margaret Atwood is just the best. Every book I've read by her I've loved - and this one is no exception...but it wasn't because of the unfleshed-out, stoic, emotionless Penelope, it was because of Atwood's artful use of the 12 Maids. Each Chorus featuring the Maids was amusing and chilling all at once. This is an excellent bit of wordsmithing and a pleasure to read."
4,another good product from gerber,"for the size of the light it works great, it is small which came in handy on the camping/caneo trip were space and wieght are tight a little hard to use like a flashlight with the tripod in the way but being able to set up the tripod or useing the rope to hang it like a lantern makes up for that small problem i will keep using it"
3,"Great light, but fragile","This was a great compact light with multiple lighting options and positions. Suitable to take backpacking as a flashlight, for playing cards around the table in the evening, lighting the inside of a tent, or using as flashing beacon. Unfortunately, the cover on the battery compartment broke the second time I opened it - appears to be very thin, fragile plastic."
5,Ridiculously awesome,"Didn't think they could top Once Triangular, but this album is even better. I can't stop listening to it. It's pop music from the year 2220 - after the fallout.If you haven't already, go see them live. If you don't have a car, take the bus. If you can't find public transportation, steal a car. They're that much fun. Some of my fondest memories back in OH took place at Gil Matera shows.Oh, and I agree that it's great music to workout to."
5,Five from me this CD is incredible,"Gil Mantera and Ultimate Donny made one hell of a CD. I heard ""Shadow Grip"" on Vanmega's (vancouver based online indie mag) 2006 audio almanac (downloadable and well worth it) It immediately captured my attention. I thought, lo-fi Depeche Mode, my buddy said Tears for Fears vocals on 8Bit tracks (8Bit being a lo-fi electronica collective, also downloadable for free, and some sweet stuff). One thing is clear: the songwriting is retro but fresh, and the vocals are excellent. The lyrics are well crafted and befit the overall feel. It strikes me that these guys know how to create something 'in concert' (the all-together sense). Apparantly, the live show is one of the best parts, and a trip to thier website's photo gallery suggests some of this craziness. Consider yourself lucky, you found this band before your friends and now get to introduce them. This CD is absolutely bangin', and represents nearly everything I am currently into musically. This will get bigger soon."
4,A valuable resource,"A factual account of the Israeli invasion of the West Bank in 2002. There are many independent sources being quoted here, as well as much valuable public record information that has gone unreported or under-reported in the main stream media, like Germany's arms embargo against Israel in April of 2002. A very valuable resource for anyone that wants to know more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in general and the invasion of the West Bank by Israeli Defensive Forces in 2002 in particular. This book presents information in a straight-forward fashion and is highly readable. Several accounts by observers seem to contradict themselves, but having checked the sources from organizations such as Human Rights Watch the information is accurate. Recommended - a unique resource in a sea of many books on the subject that lack objectivity."
3,Tom Reynolds Review,"In essence I agree with many of the succinct comments made by Tom. However,I have rated it higher than Tom's one star due to the rather superb soundtrack (which I have not been able to purchase),I also felt that Kay Lenz gave a terrific performance as the grasping,shallow and opportunistic sister."
2,An OK CD,"When I got the CD, I knew about ""Crush""... that's a great song, but unfortunately, most of the other songs on the CD aren't so great. But again, a few really good songs on a CD is enough for me to buy it!"
2,A BETTER STRUCTURED CD WOULD SOAR HER TO THE TOP.,"""Crush"" is definitely the standout song on this CD. There are some nice pop dittys like ""Questions"", and ""Always You"", however the CD falls short - with each song trying its own personality to fit Paige in a certain category, they tried to cover all bases....this is what happened to Debbie Gibson with ""Body Mind Soul"", and look where her music career went. This CD is good for background music, except ""Crush"" is the only time you want to crank it up."
5,America's brightest new star!,"If you think that ""Crush"" is infectious, then you've got to listen to ""Always You"", the remixes! Even her ballads are infectious! This album is superb! Jennifer Paige was smart to come to Los Angeles to be discovered!"
3,"If you like Ballads, then you might like this CD","I bought this CD for ""Crush"". Some of the songs are better then others. Yes it was --BARELY-- worth what I paid for it.(It doesn't sound good being plyed on the Computer, either.) IF YOU DON'T LIKE LOVE BALLADS, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THIS CD! Borrow ""Crush"" from a friend."
3,so-so,"The title cut is definitely the highlight. Most of the rest are soundalikes. On some tunes, her voice isn't very strong and somewhat off key. If you like Mariah Carey, you'll like her."
3,jp,"When i first got this cd, i only was familiar with one song on it, Crush. But as i listened to the rest of the cd, i found other tracks i liked. Jennifer Paige sounds like Rachel Stevens (former S Club 7 member) meets Dido. This cd is definitely worth a listen."
3,"Interesting... still lacking, though","While I found Jennifer Paige's debut to be a very good CD with tracks along the lines of 80s pop to 90s soul, it is a very strange mix of songs. Her voice is very nicely suited to most, but I'm afraid there are some that simply make you shudder! Her single ""Crush"" offers a good dance pop time, while others like ""Questions"" sort of leave you with an adult comtempo flare. It's an album worth hearing, but I'd try before I'd buy."
4,Nice Mood Music,"When I first got this album when it came out back in 1997, I was disapointed. I got it for the song ""Crush"" which I love, but all of the other songs are very quiet and sound alike to me. I do like ""Always You"" and ""Somewhere Someday"" and I believe now that the rest of her songs are perfect for some nice, soothing background music."
5,A Definite Recommended Buy--Jennifer Paige,"This CD is absolutely great!! I bought the CD for the song, Crush, and got 9 more superb recordings to boot. It was a true surprise. It's not a question whether or not ""Crush"" will make Number One, but how many weeks it will stay Number One. The other songs are strong, as well. I particularly liked ""Always You"" and ""Between You and Me"". If this is Jennifer's debut CD, then she really hit with a BIG BANG, and will soon become a household name. This is a definite ""Got to Have"" CD."
4,Too underated...this girl's good.,"This is a good album, and I bought it because I loved the song ""Crush"" which was all over the radio at the time. But that is the only song of Jennifer's that I have ever heard on the radio. I don't know why, as there are some equally good songs on here that deserve airplay. It seems to me, that she is really underated...she is so much better than a lot of the pop singers of today. Such as a certain person that I won't name like Britney...oops, the name slipped, sorry. Anyway, this is a good album and deserves a listen. Booklet contains all lyrics and a couple of photos of Jennifer."
5,Brilliant,This CD is great...... She has a brilliant voice.... i have not heard one like this for quite some time now. I can't wait for the next CD
3,Over Synthesized.,"Jennifer Paige's self titled album is a remix of itself. Paige tends to fall back on the ever-present synthesized beats and variations to cover up her insecurity in using real instruments. While ""Crush"" hit it big, I see radio-worthy potential only in ""Get to Me"" and possibly ""Questions."" Paige is constantly focused on love and less on the other finer things in life. The only track that doesn't deal with love, passion, unrequited love and/or passion, obsessive love and/or passion, destructive love and/or passion and fufilling love and/or passion is ""Questions."" And even this song gets around to love in the final two lines ""...now that love's knocking at my door/that's how I know there's something more..."" The songs are musically catchy but lack depth found in other artists of this genre. If you want a spiritually fufilling album, check out Sarah McLachlan, Jewel, Natalie Merchant and even Heather Nova. But if you are looking to turn the beat around, stick with Jennifer Paige."
2,"PRODUCER PUPPET,","I AM NOT SURE WHY THIS CD WAS NOT LISTED UNDER ANDY GOLDMARK, HE IS BASICALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE THING, EXCEPT THE VOCALS WHICH IS JENNIFER IS JOB. ANDY WROTE OR COWROTE ALL THE SONGS PRODUCED AND ARRANGED ALL OF THEM EXCEPT ONE. I THINK JENNIFER SINGS WELL, BUT FOR MUSICAL TALENT I AM NOT SURE IF SHE HAS ANY WRITING OR ARRANGING ABILITY AT ALL? SO THIS REVIEW IS FOR ANDY, JENNIFER IS A COMPETENT SINGER. THIS CD DOES NOT DO IT FOR ME, BORING IN THE MIDDLE TO VERY END. IT LACKS THE ZEST TO KEEP THE LISTENERS ATTENTION. THIS CD DOES NOT HAVE AN KICK TO IT, ITS WELL PRODUCED, BUT IT IS SLICK POP MUSIC THAT JUST KIND FLOPS. ""CRUSH"" IS THE HIGHLIGHT, THATS IT, THE REST IS PREDICTABLE BLAND POP MUSIC. JENNIFER GET ANOTHER PRODUCER SONGWRITER NEXT TIME , IF YOUR LUCKY ENOUGH FOR A NEXT TIME."
2,American lighting - Maril's weak history of lighting,Ms. Maril's late husband left her a hodgepodge collection of light fixtures. She has tried to mold this collection into a history of lighting. Unfortunately a book of photographs and some old catalogue pages do not a history make. Ms. Maril needs to move beyond her limited collection and give us a real history. For some time the author has written a column on antique lighting for Victorian Home magazine. Unfortunately the column suffers from the same weaknesses as the book.
4,An excellent overview of the history of American Lighting,"Psrticularly strong in presenting the development of electric lighting, Ms.Maril's text, photographs and catalogue illustrations help to explain the stylistic development of lamps, chandeliers and wall fixtures in the United States during the second half of the 19th century and first half of the 20th century.This book is a helpful resource for both beginning and advanced collectors and it's is so attractive, you may want to leave it out on your coffee table!"
2,An average attempt in a rich subject,"As an antique reproduction manufacturer, I find this book very limited and barely touching the rich depth of this area of American History. Ancestors populated the east coast since 1595 have first hand knowledge, written descriptions and actual lanterns and chandeliers throughout the periods. This book rarely indicates the history nor the flavor and texture of the various periods American Lighting has past though. The pictures are nice."
3,A masterpiece ruined by poor remastering,"I have fond memories of this album from when I was a teenager. I had read the reviews on Amazon that complained of a lousy remastering job, but thought ""how bad could it be?"". Well... it's bad. It's really bad. The sound is really flat and dull. Now I wish I had purchased the mobile fidelity version for 4 times the price of this piece of crap.I still think the music is great though. The arrangements and musicianship is top notch."
3,*sigh*,"I logged on hoping that Sony had finally gotten around to reissuing this... no such luck. _Blood Sweat & Tears 3_ is the last of the four major BST albums not to not receive a decent remastering job, and ironically, it's the one that most needed it. Sony's mega-cheapo ""Collector Series"" reissues were an embarassment when they came out, and are even less excusable today, boasting horrific sound, shrunken cover art, and no liner notes or booklet of any sort. _There's a Riot Going On_ by Sly Stone and _Having a Party with Southside Johnny_ are two other classics that continue to suffer this fate. Wake up, guys!"
3,a fatal omission,"I feel very sad about this reissue, because there is one final note missing. On the original vinyl, there was a soft sound of music box's lid closing at the end of 40,000 Headmen. Without it, the album can never be complete. A fatal omission."
3,a fatal omission,"I feel very sad about this reissue, because there is one final note missing. On the original vinyl, there was a soft sound of music box's lid closing at the end of 40,000 Headmen. Without it, the music can never be complete. A fatal omission."
2,This CD sucks. . .,"Thankfully I found out that none less than the highly esteemed Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab is remastering this neglected classic on their hybrid SACD format. Thank God, I've got sympathy for the devil, but not a horrific sounding reissue."
1,Get Your Pipe & Slippers,"Boy am I surprised by the great reviews this album receives from the utimate bunch of squares: BS & T. Look - I go back to the day this piece of garbage was released and on that day, Philadelphia radio BURNED THIS ALBUM TO DEATH and rightly so. This was a band trying to be hip back in the day of real innovation in 1970: Hendrix, The Who, Beatles, Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock, Procol Harum, Yes, etc. These guys were fake jazzers from the start. Jive white guys trying to fit in. Gee can't you see balding David Clayton Thomas fronting the Rolling Stones? Come on. And boy that guitarist Steve Katz jamming with Hendrix? If you truly think this music was or is still ""with-it"" there is an argyle button down sweater, a pipe and slippers waiting for you!"
3,depends what your looking for,"this book is as simple as it gets, a great book to start out with. he covers the fool proof 5, some stuff to stay away from, and if your smart, more stuff to stay away from. if you know nothing, you will learn alot. if you want to identify as many mushrooms as possible, look elsewhere."
1,not good,I thought I was buying a nice colorful book with colorful pictures inside like on the cover. NOT! The cover is the best part of the book. The pictures inside are difficult to see exactly what the mushroom should look like and they are in black and white
3,Updates cover but outdates text.,This is an old book without much updating exccept for the cover photos.It is accurate and usable but nothing to get excited about.
3,WEAK SAUCE,"At first, I thought that this CD was a good deal for the price and the tracks; however, the songs are not the ""old skool"" but recent recordings. Some of the cuts are not bad, but ""Freekshow"" does not make it. Do not buy this one if you seek the original jams. Still, if you would like another version of some classics, this might not be a bad buy for the price."
3,Didn't Quite Rattle My Chains,"Chain Letter is a slasher movie whose plot is very reminiscent to late 90's slashers like Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Urban Legend. Only it's not as good as those, because it doesn't seem to realize that it's a teen slasher movie and takes itself way too seriously. There are a few fun death sequences in this thing, but most of them are more torture porn than teen slasher. Also, Chain Letter can be too preachy with its ""technology is evil"" message. And the ending is pretty disappointing. Still, I was never too bored while watching Chain Letter. The acting is very good, I will say. But how could the acting not be good when you have a cast that includes veterans like Keith David (who gets a lot of screen time), Brad Dourif, and Betsy Russell."
2,Chain Letter,Can't they make anymore good horror movies these days?Anthor one you would want to skip.Glad I didn't pay any money to see it.
3,Exceeded my expectations...,This movie exceeded my expectations & i found it to be quite enjoyable. It is by no means brilliant however it did manage to keep me on the edge of my seat and surprised me with the ending. Much better than some that have come out lately.
2,Letter Be....,"As in let this movie b....sad to say, I love horror movies...I love Betsy Russell...but this movie goes nowhere with her nor the plot...leaves you hanging....and that is that...glad I have it as I have almost everything Betsy Russell but if she wasn't in it, it would go in the sell bin...wow, my first negative comment on Amazon..sorry..."
3,Pretty good.,This movie is okay. I think it is intended for a younger audience. It is okay to watch once but I don't think I will watch it again.
2,"Unfocused, Over-Bloated and Pretentious","You know you're in trouble when a slasher movie feels the need to start off with a quote from Neitzsche.Some truly impressive gore effects can not keep CHAIN LETTER from smothering under the weight of its ludicrously unfocused, over-bloated script, and this weird sense of arrogant self-importance that seems to hover over the whole movie.Dion seems to think he's layin' down some real heavy you-know-what here, but he's not. He's sledgehammering his trite ""technology is evil!"" theme down my throat so hard that I feel like I'm tomorrow's plate of foie gras.Dion, I have two words for you: Re! Lax!Patrick - ScreamQueenz Horror Blog"
4,It's Allright!,"I give this movie 4 stars. When I first saw this movie, I thought I was going to be bored out of my mine. But, I was wrong.This movie was fantastic from beginning to end. The best part of the movie was when she was tied up in plastic in her pajamas barefooted. She was trying to get free before her parents drove out of the garage. To me that was the best part of the movie.The rest of it was allright, but I think they should have one sex scene at least. I think that will spiced up the movie a little bit.This movie is worth getting. I promise!"
2,"Gory, gross, no hope","Okay, it's a horror movie and they don't exactly uplift the viewer. But this one is just plain...mean, nasty, a real downer. I like a tad bit of fun or comic relief with my horror, but this one offers up a sick universe where no such things exist to counterbalance the nastiness.That said, Brad Dourif is as effectively creepy as ever as a teacher who does not care for technology inside or outside of his classroom."
1,Chain Letter Review,"This movie stinks like WWE Wrestlemania 9!!! There's nothing to the ""If you the chain letter,you get killed"" storyline. The plot drags on & on like that ""I Quit"" match between The Miz & John Cena from Over the Limit 2011 and copies most of it from The Ring. The title opening is annoying like that orange from Youtube. The opening kill was pointless like Peter's cow kite. The cast are also annoying,forgettable,stupid and 1D. The only A+ is the blood & gore but gets ruined by bad editing. The villian is also 1D like the bullies form IT. The jump scares are predictable & not scary. This makes WCW Halloween Havoc 2000 scarier by compairson. I give Chain Letter a 1 out of 10."
1,NOT GOOD !,"THIS MOVIE IS SO LAME DO NOT RENT IT OR ""BUY"" IT . YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY IM GLAD I DID NOT BUY IT I GOT THRU NETFLIX !!!"
3,You get what you pay for...,"This grill is great for cooking up burgers, steaks and dogs. But maintaining a low heat for a slow cooked item is nearly impossible. I've recently started adjusting the flame at the gas valve to achieve low temps. As expected, the ignited was shot after a couple months."
5,Average story line,Nice to have known a little more of the Superstar's life of Michael Jordan. Purchased this DVD (used) with no glitches or skipping.
4,2 Spinners for 1 ? Its buy time people,"This was truly the end.Yesterday ,today & tomorrow was the last of the gems.You can tell they tryed hard to make this album another spinners classic.cuts like i found love ,your the love of my life and i must be living for a broken heart are truly the spinners at their best!.The song baby i need your love ia a bad attempt to remake the classic love don,t love nobody.Throwing a good love away is the song that tells mr wynn don,t know it now but you know it someday!.Labor of love is a disco cd it,s ok i guess because im a big spinners fan enjoy!"
5,Me and my music,This Is real singing every song has meaming.a man could serenade his woman the words that he couldn't conform are all there.
3,Unless you're in the business the book is not for you.,"I bought this book thinking it was written for the investor looking for solid information for selection, ratings and in depth profiles of rated firms. Not true."
5,Much better version,"I find the 1995 version to be much more appealing then the newer 1999 edition. The layout in the cards in this deck is simply more visually appealing. But either deck is a surreal masterpiece. I particularly enjoyed the image of The Chariot as a Formula 1 racing car! I would recommend the deck to intermediate to advanced readers, or simply those who wish to admire the rich artwork."
3,Terrible sound,"Although I am a huge fan of historic opera performances and listen to plenty old pirates with awful sound, this one is particularly unpleasant. It's certainly not derived from radio tapes, but from an audience member. There is an enormous amount of distortion at climaxes. You can make out the voices ok, but considering that Vinay and Tebaldi have both left several recorded performances of these roles, I'm not sure of the particular value of this recording. They are both in terrific voice here, to be sure, and sing with a great deal of intensity, but I don't ultimately think it's worth paying full price for this set."
2,Antenna adapter for male threaded end,"Although this product was listed as the opposite as the BNC to female SMA, it had an additional wire inside the end that prevented its use with a male threaded antenna. Also the shipping was too high on this item."
4,A fun mystery with Wild goose (Auk really) chase,"The title from Woman in Love, by D. H. Lawrence with a thought of cleaning the world, with ""No more people. Just uninterrupted grass, and a hare sitting up."". This sets the tone for a mystery, with 2 identical brothers, one researching deadly bacteriological culture. Sir John Appleby, with the help of Lady Appleby prowling around an old school attic, is off to solve his disappearance, in his civilized manner. There is a Wild Goose (well really a Wild Auk chase), to a secret island. There is enough fun in this book for everyone, especially bird watchers. There are also literate allusions like when referring to one the eccentricities of one of the characters:. He has "" Prospero fantasies. The sense that he has supernatural aerial messengers at his command"", which is refers to The Tempest."
1,Wild Goose,"Disappointing in the extreme. Although the opening chapter attractively imagines a world empty of people, with references to chemical weapons and the W.H.O. as relevant now as then, it soon peters out into mediocrity. The disappearance of a scientist (possibly with a vial of bacteria) leads Appleby on an episodic chase from a prep. school to a mad earl's estate to an Atlantic island. The quarry turns out not to be hare, but wild goose, half-baked and tasteless."
3,too easy,"I enjoyed the author's writing style, but a big part of the solution was obvious far too early, and the end became ridiculous."
2,Not a Conspiracy Buff,"I agree with some of the other reviews regarding this novel--it's mediocre and the ending was ridiculous. Very transparent. Maybe I'm just not a hard-core conspiracy buff, but I just couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to buy into the story."
2,Disappointed,"I've been a fan right from the first book but I have to say this is not up to his usual standard whatsoever. This book read more like a paranoid political mouthpiece than a thriller and I'm very disappointed that he thought his fans would think that was a great idea. This ""thriller"" was so non-thrilling the only way the author could attempt to bring tension to the story was by blatently hiding facts from the reader (for example Justin would get on the phone with another character and instead of making the reader privy to the conversation we, the reader, get to read that Justin told the other character what he wanted -- not any details. How bogus is that?Because of the political overtones early in the story I could have written the end of the book about 1/4th of the way into it as well.I hope this author returns to the original formula that won him so many fans."
2,First time reader of R. Andrews... Maybe my last,"At this point in time, I'm about 3/4 of the way through this book, and told my wife that I already know how it ends... I will continue to read it hoping for some sort of redemption... aside from the brief sexual encounter between the new chief of police and his new hire... Which I agree with all those who've pointed it out... Small town cop + new female officer = NOT GONNA HOOK UP! If this guy is so smart, he would have avoided that like the plague. The author tends to use the ""hero's"" full name WAY too often... Justin Westwood this and Justin Westwood that... By the end of the first two chapters, the reader should pretty much be on a first name basis with the main character."
2,Thoroughly Mediocre Novel,"This book just doesn't deliver. It's got cliched characters (the now low-ambition cop who got his family killed with his past renegade recklessness -- sound familiar?), and a superficially convoluted but ultimately guessable conspiracy style plot. And all throughout is a non-veiled (I'd say ""thinly veiled,"" but there is really no veiling at all) allegory on Bush and the ""war on terror."" I guess if the author is trying to sneak some politics into the reading of folks who would normally bolt from such a thing, then good for him. But for other people who actully know what's going on in the real political world, the allegorical stuff just comes off as tedious.Suffice it to say, I only read this a week ago, and I've already forgotten how it ends, and also the name of the main character. That should say it all."
1,Many flaws and certainly not worth the price.,"We bought ours for our small business about 18 month ago, using it about once a week. I can without a doubt say this is the worst vaccuum I've ever owned. For starters, it is very heavy. Anyone who is not fit would have challenges with that alone. None of the tools or attachments fit well. They barely attach to the hose, and then fall off almost every time we try to use them. The hose is stiff and attached to the vac at such a point that nearly every time we use it, the vac tips over unless we hold it.We have also had lots of noise issues, rattles, sqeals, etc.The final straw for us was when we accidentally spilled a display the other day and the Oreck failed to pick up a visible amount of the sandy debris. One of my employees who lives nearby ran home and brought back their $100 hoover and it quicky picked up everything the $400 Oreck left behind. So, the Oreck is now awaiting disposal and I bought an inexpensive new Hoover for the shop."
2,Cheaply made,"These lens covers are cheap, flimsy and don't fit well. It would cost me more than they are worth to send them back. The claimed sizes are a little off too. On the pair I received they are so loose they fall off the binoculars when I tilt them lens down. I've had to tape them on to keep from losing them."
4,Good lens covers... for the right binoculars,"I purchased these rubber lens covers for a pair ofFujinon Techno-Stabi - Binoculars 12 x 32 - image stabilizedbinoculars. The lens covers themselves are flexible enough to fit nicely over the objective lens and provide great protection for them... but the barrels of the objective lenses are too short to accommodate both the covers and tether rings. Therefore, for my particular binoculars, I plan to cut off the tethers and rings and just use the covers themselves to protect my binocs.September 6 update: I tried putting these lens covers on a pair ofCanon 10x30 Image Stabilization Binoculars w/Case, Neck Strap & Batteriesbinoculars, and they fit that model also. Again, the barrels of the objective lenses are short, so you'll need to cut off the tether ring. But the rubber caps fit nice and snug, so I don't see a problem with them falling off easily."
2,Just okay,"My daughter was given an autographed copy of this book as a gift. As far as I'm concerned, the autograph is the best part of the book.The book tries to show the benefits of cooperation and sharing. However, the story itself is trite and predictable. Three friends encounter a rabbit trying in vain to dig up a giant carrot and keep it all for himself. The three are kind and helpful, even as the rabbit is greedy and unfriendly. Of course, by the end of the story the carrot is dug up and the rabbit has seen the error of his ways. There are no surprises here, and even the language is uninspired and dull.On the plus side, the illustrations are colorful and playful.Children who are familiar with these characters from TV might react better to this book. For kids like mine who don't know these characters already, don't bother trying to introduce them through this book."
4,Contemporary Genetics for Easy Reading,"This book is good for those who want to learn about genetics without reading a tedious, text-ridden book. The diagrams are simple enough to understand without being too involved. The text, usually complete, lacks in some areas. That's why I rated it a ""4"" instead of ""5"". I would recommend this book for graduate students in the ""Biomedical sciences"" and also dedicated medical students want a strong background in genetics."
5,amazing book,"The wolf King is a amazing book! i stumbled across this book back in 7th grade and fell in love!! my two years in junior high were spent reading this book and wilderness companion. I had this book so long the librarian would just renew it for me and ask me to bring them back at the end of the year. i couldnt stop reading them! and all the lippingcott books are amazing! my last year of junior high my librarian gave me the wahoo bobcat as a gift and i have been blessed in my adult years to not only find and buy wolf king, but wilderness companion and many other books by mr lippingcott. i can not wait to share these amazing books with my daughter and hope she loves them as much as i do :)"
4,Very good book,"The book is a good description of the people that inhabited the islands when Columbus arrived. He does a great job describing the different peoples (Taino's, Caribes, etc.) and their differences in culture and language. As a Puerto Rican I found it informational on learning more of my non-European ancestry."
4,"Good starting point, with good references","This book references so many other works it might be hard to keep up, or find half of these books to read in the first place. Basically devoted to chapters each giving some broad stroke overviews on various topics and people groups and theories of migratory patterns, I think this is an excellent place to start. I would probably compliment this with some more recent works by Maximilian C. Forte for the next step of reading."
2,This movie is BAD.,"Golf Punks originally premiered on the Fox Family Channel. The web page says it's rated PG-13, though. I don't know if that's a mistake or not; maybe they had to take things out to play it on TV. Anyways, I'll probably buy this when the price drops because I want to get all Lampoon films on video, but unless you already saw this and liked it, I don't recommend it. See Men In White instead, which is better, and I hope will come to video too."
1,What a god awful movie,"Firstly, the color quality was atrocious. I dont know if its a bad disc, or if somthings wrong with my PAL machine? Might not have read the NTSC format its in propperlly? But its the only DVD that has ever done it on my player. (its an all regioun DVD player, so yes, it does play regioun 1 DVD's fine) But even if the movie was presented in propper color.....I was expecting it to be great, Tom Arnold, and National Lampoons....sounds great right? Too bad it wasnt :(The movie has written on it ""its the mighty ducks meets caddyshack"" or somthing like that? But man, I think i chuckled once during the whole movie! it was completly predictable, not funny, useless things thrown in here and there, and just a plain awfull movie. Maybe a kid under the age of 10 might get somthing out of it? but I dont even know how this came to beeing bothered with to be put on DVD?"
2,"""BAD"" expounded.","This film is no more than a preachy after-school special in lowest vein of family fluff as ""Mighty Ducks,"" ""Heavyweights,"" and countless others. While those at least pretend to be real movies, GP somehow manages to be worse in every aspect. Scene changes seem crafted for commercial breaks, the titular ""punks"" are a motley crew of misfits who (as tradition dictates) couldn't act their way out of a citcom parent trap, Arnold is dumbed down to play his ""Stupids"" character in earnest, and misguided attempts at slapstick would fail even if the film had any credibility. The soundtrack is the icing on the cake (left out in the rain). Basically, it consists of an alternation between a Casio keyboard demonstration and a slackjawed old guy repeating ""we all end up in a hole,"" forcing an especially bad pun down the viewer's throat for the entire film. The self-respecting viewer will not last through the end."
2,lampoon movies aren't like they used to be,"i remember a time when i got excited when i saw a lampoon title. Now I dred it. It feels like they are recking there once great name with every new movie. This movie is pretty and it is only for die hard tom arnold fans. I feel that he can't hold a movie but that's another story. Well, it did entertain me for a little bit."
1,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of Danny Kaye so I was delighted to find this CD, but after listening to it all the way through once, there is only one song I would listen to again. It probably won't see the light of day again until I donate it to the local library or sell it in my next yard sale."
5,Blues Review: Johnny Winter And / Live,What can I say? Johhny Winter at his peak!And he's still performing and relevant after all these years!And so is his brother Edgar!
2,Johnny Winter's Killer Rock and Roll medley,"I was looking for a CD version of a cassette tape of a Johnny and Edgar Winter live concert, which I've misplaced.There's a killer medly of old rock and roll hits I was particularly hoping to find. This CD isn't the one. I've since discovered the one I want is a collector's item and is priced out of my range. I'll keep looking in the attic for the cassette version."
4,Great Material,Great material but I wish they would do something with the recording. Several of these songs are also on the Greatest Hits cd and sound twice as clean as they do on this recording.
4,A long-time favorite,"I purchased the CD on order to load this music onto an iPod, but have enjoyed the LP for nearly 40 years. Although Johnny and Rick Derringer took a false step at times, they did play off each other well. The version of ""Mean Town Blues"" reaches a fever pitch during the interplay between the two, and the version of ""Jumping Jack Flash"" is one of few Stones covers that not only doesn't fall flat, but surges with energy. At the time this album was released, the conventional wisdom was that Johnny Winter would probably not survive the decade, so I'm happy to see that he is still playing the blues, and doing it well."
4,Winter Blues,"Another energetic blues-rocker, with help from Rick Derringer. Most of this set is devoted to covers of '50's rock'n'roll classics. What Winter lacks as a vocalist, he makes up for with his fiery fretwork."
3,Good but a little overrated,"I don't mean Johnny is over rated cause he wrote the book . The Sound quallity is a little lacking on Live And ... Derringers Guitar is a lot Lower in the mix than Winters .The song list is good but better on other live albums like Walking by my self and Lone Star shoot out .There are great versions of JJ Flash and JB Goode on here . A drum solo and a full lenghth guitar spotlight solo arn't really needed here , there are to many other songs they could be jamming on .I saw johnny and Edgar at the 97 show they recoded in NYC , Johnny and Edgar dual back and forth Edgar on Sax Johnny ,guitar. Loud and Clear"
4,GREAT ROCK AND ROLL,"JOHNNY WINTER HAS HAD SEVERAL PHASES TO HIS CAREER. THIS ALBUM DATES BACK TO THE EARLY 70'S, WHEN HE WAS PLAYING STRAIGHT AHEAD ROCK AND ROLL, WHICH HE HASN'T DONE NOW IN OVER THIRTY YEARS. WHILE HIS LATER AUTHENTIC BLUES MUSIC IS GREAT, THIS ALBUM JUST GOES TO ANOTHER LEVEL, WITH ITS HARD DRIVING RHYTHM, AND SCREAMING GUITARS (WITH RICK DERRINGER). IF YOU LIKE ROCK AND ROLL YOU WILL LOVE THIS ALBUM."
4,A Whole Lotta Shaking Indeed,"This is the fourth copy of this recording I've owned. I had the Album, the 8 track, the casset, and now the CD.....My only complaint is that no one re-mixed it to digital. None the less this is some of the finest blues guitar out of Texas prior to Stevie Ray Vaughn, and Chris Duarte.The high energy level Johnny Winter brings to such gems as Good Morning Little School Girl, and Whole Lotta Shakin really puts you in front and center of the stage as if you're right there live. Most of the songs in ""Live"" are on his other recordings, but no matter how well you like them elsewhere you'll soon discover he vamped them up here. A ride well worth the small admission...."
5,The best of Johnny Winter Rocking,"This is the best album Johnny Winter has put out and sadly I own almost all his albums. For what I've spent I could have had a new car. He has probably 75 albums out. This might not be his best blues album;but, as for rock and roll there is none better. And the period means just that. period. Beware it is raw."
5,Awesome Box Set,This is an Awesome deal. I bought this set at a local Wal-Mart for arouund $20. The set came with a Commemorative DVD (Volume 1)which features two other TV shows very first episodes. Family Matter and Head of the Class. I hope they release Family Matters on dvd in the near future.
4,The Fresh Prince-The First Season.,"I have this dvd and i`m just going to review disc 1 to rate the episodes 10 out of 101)The Fresh Prince Project/10/102)Bang The Drum, Ashley/10/103)Clubba Hubba/10/104)Not With My Pig You Don`t/9/105)Homeboy Sweet Homeboy/10/106)Mistaken Identity/9/107)Def Poet`s Society/9/10"
3,VERY SEXUALLY HARASSING! RACIST!,WATCHED WITH 6 YEAR OLD KIDS . LOTS OF SEXUAL REFERENCES AND MILD LANGUAGE. SWEARING IN EVERY EPISODE.NOT RECOMEMNED FOR CHILDREN!RACIST JOKES AND SEX REFERENCES!
2,Frustrated,I first downloaded it to my computer and the picture of it was really fuzzy. I had to download it a second time and now the picture is incredibly bright and I know its not my computer. It needs to be worked on.
3,My view on the Fresh Prince of Bel Air season 1;,"The 1st season was ok.We were all introduced to Wills relatives like;Aunt Viv(played by Janet Hubert Whitten through seasons 1 -3),Uncle Phil(played by James Avery),Hilary who was the stuckup,self centered valley girl(played by Karyn Parsons),Carlton(played by Alfonso Riberio),Ashley the youngest of the Banks( played by Tatyana Ali)and the butler Geoffrey(played by Joseph Marcell).Also notable guest in season 1 were;Vivica A Fox,Queen Latifah,and Dwayne Wayne.I wouldnt recommend season 1 because it want that funny but if you are a collector like me(I have all 3 seasons)then I definetly wouldnt let you pass this buy."
5,A classic everyone should see!,I honestly can't say enough good things about this show. I grew up with this show and loved watching it with family. It was hilarious and it always kept me happy. There's no drama in this show which I love. It was strictly comedy. I miss this show and I think everyone should check out a few episodes or two!
5,Awesome Tv Series,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is the most fantastic show i'v ever seen. it is hillarious. i'm glad that they are putting this tv shows on dvd.
5,I Highly Recommend This Item,"This item is Great,It came Very fast Came Quicky I recommend this item to any one who likes sitcoms or Will Smith. In a rating of 1 to 10 i give it a 30!!!"
5,FINALLY !!,"I grew up watching this show and it was a dissappointment to learn that this show was not on DVD yet - while other mediocre shows were being released like a tidal wave.Finally it is here.This show, will make you laugh, cry, moan, groan and all that good stuff you'd want from a TV show.tiny little fact: Will Smith was the only one in the entire cast that wasn't a proffesional actor when the show debuted.But he stole the show anyway. And millions would tune in to watch his funny antics - not to mention the opening credits soundtrack.WATCH THIS !!! IT'S WORTH IT!!!"
5,Truely Great,"This is really one of my favorite shows, even though I only watched it as a kid (yes, a kid). As I watch it now, it really reminds me how great of a show it was and still is. I was surprised to see a 24 episode FIRST SEASON, but it seems that all the seasons of this show were around that size. After buying and watching all the episodes within a week, I can definately say that I will be purchasing the rest of the DVD collection (right now seasons 2 and 3) shortly. Highly recommended DVD set."
3,Fresh Prince Season One,it was good...the cover had a torn off sticker on it! and it took FOREVER to arrive!! ;/
3,Better for a small neck,"As noted, this product will stretch, but your girl will probably not appreciate this feature very much. The necklace has no backing or edging that would keep it from ""biting"" her. It will pinch if stretched, and it may also irritate her neck even if it's not stretched. It is very attractive for the price, and it was well-packaged and delivered quickly."
1,ugly will not fit,"I have returned this item and am waiting to see if i ever get my money back, or i would be honest of how wrong the discription was of the vehical this would fit! Not even close!"
1,It is so dumb that it doesn't rate a' so bad it is good.' accolade.,"duh. The comic relief is more parenthetical than the devoided story line, and that is a very generous. Is this a movie? Perhaps it is a new art form, beyond movies.I liked McColm in NIght Man.What is talented Amanda Pays doing in this movie?"
5,Great Booster Seat!!,This is a great Booster seat my daughter loves it. The biggest problem I had with car seats that we have had in the past is how she slept. We have used Eddie Bauer by Costco and a Britax Roundabout The Britax was great but the Costco was awful and I would have to drive and try to keep her head from flopping into her lap. It was awful! Now that she is a big girl and in a Booster seat she first off loves the comfort of it and not having the regular shoulder harness she feels like a grown-up because she uses the seatbelt like Mommy & Daddy. The cupholders make it convienent for her to get her sippy cups. Last but not least she sleeps like a baby without her head in her lap!! I really love it and the price is right too. I used overnight shipping and by 1:00pm the following day I was installing in my new car. Thanks Amazon!
5,"So far, so good! Comfy. Easy to wash & use.","We've had this seat just about a month. Bought it before a 6-hour drive for our just-5-year old son because his 7-month old brother outgrew his carrier seat. Easy to install and use (in 2001 Odyssey). My son can unbuckle himself when we arrive (he's good about not unbuckling any other time). Took a couple long naps already in it with few or no complaints about neck stiffness. Unfortunately, he got sick last weekend in the car, but clean up was relatively easy. Covers went into the washer, emerging clean a short time later. He likes the seat as do we. It's well made, not flimsy at all. Gives a parent peace of mind that your child is still more protected than a plain booster or just the car seat."
5,Great seat!,"We bought this seat and a Graco one for our other car. This seat is so nice! The arm rests that move are great, and make it really easy to buckle the seat belt. The seat folds really easily! LOVE IT!"
3,okay,"I am a big fan of polo. This in not my favorite polo, a little too strong for some people but long lasting"
3,Polo aftershave,"Thought I was getting the spray rather than the splash. Aside from that, product was as advertised."
2,fragrance is different,"the fragrance is old and stalewould not purchase it again,perhaps it should not be sold as sampler ."
1,"Useless, avoid.","This thing doesn't grip the filter or filter housing, it just slips. I'm returning it and going to buy one of the standard cup wrenches in the exact size."
2,2 STARS Are GENEROUS,"I usually try to write the reviews on a book as soon as I finish. I think I can write a much more fair and accurate review.. but sometimes when the book hasn't impressed me it can come out a little more critical. This book is about a college teacher in his 30's dating his students. I realize that does sound a bit simple considering the book has almost 300 pages,but when I reflect that's about it. The author has made this character quite obsessed with his private anatomy. He really is quite good at coming up with all kinds of descriptive words concerning his part and what he does with it.Actually he tends to get pretty boring with his sex talk ,he throughs it in nomatter what the situation happens to be. I hurried through the last to finish only because I wanted to see if anybody managed to live happy ever after. I'm not telling and I'm also not recommending this one. Except of course if you or someone you know needs a little schooling in sex education then here's your book!!"
1,Musical Tracers,"I'm trying to fight off my own negativity while reviewing this record but if you've played music long enough, you can pretty easily sit down with the Beatles material, pull from it, and create a hybrid Beatles throwaway song. These guys did just that. You can trace a drawing and you can do the same thing to music.So I guess they get an A for effort for being able to accurately rip off the early Beatle sound.Also, The Beatles were very much identified with Rickenbackers; I'm guessing that's where the name ""Knickerbockers"" comes into play, but whatever. Golf-claps for The Knickerbockers."
3,Half And Half,"This book is an enjoyable read, especially for those true music fans who can only imagine a radio station that would care as much for the music as the do at WAOR. As far as a music/detective novel, I'll give it 50% on both sides. The music references were SUPURB, but it's a detective novel. The private investigator that Rick will become will hopefully spawn a little more excitement and not be quite as predictable. Overall, once again, it was an enjoyable read. It was my first from this author and I will definitely pick up another of his novels."
4,Not as good as the first two,"See storyline above.I keep waiting for Bill Fitzhugh to write something as funny as his first two novels (Pest Control, Organ Grinders), but his recent novels just haven't quite done it (Maybe Tim Dorsey spoiled it for me).I've read all his novels and still enjoy his story-telling and his ability to draw you into the plot. They are fun and fast-paced and definitely easy to get through.Recommended."
5,Classic Rock Trivia Galore,"Who is Tommy Bolin and is ""Teaser"" any good? That is just one of many questions I'm asking myself after reading Radio Activity. Anyone into classic rock will enjoy the great references, the trivia, the professional selection of music to be played on a classic rock station.The music and the radio business intrigue is blended with a fine mystery. Bill Fitzhugh has honed his writing skills while maintaining his great sense of humor."
2,Love Bill Fitzhugh - but this one stinks,"I'm an avid reader and I got addicted to this author back when I first read Pest Control. However, I never even finished this book I was so bored with it. I really didn't care how it ended. It just didn't have the snappy wit I've seen in other books and the story just wasn't interesting. Needs to go back to the drawing board."
5,You Will Love It!,"Brother to Brother is an outstanding collection of stories. Anyone (gay or not) can relate to the akwardness of a first kiss or frustration with the ""single club scene"". These are some of the themes in Brother to Brother. In San Francisco there is a theatre show called ""Up Jumped Springtime"" that puts some of the stories from this book on stage. Three fine actors do justice to every word. Neither the book nor the show are to be missed. Both are engageing, sexy and will have you in the floor laughing!"
2,video of constantine and the cross,"very badly acted and didn' like it at all, couldn't even finish watching it. not worth the time or money"
3,It got me heading in the right direction...,"I spent $200 on all the ingredients, tools, jars, etc to make the products. The nightly treatment has an odor that stinks to high heaven. It's very time-consuming and messy to make the products and to use them. Some items need to be stored in the fridge and for the 7 weeks I stuck with it, the inconvenience became more and more intolerable.However, using the organic natural products improved the health of my scalp. My hair wasn't falling out in clumps anymore. It made me realize over-the-counter brands as well as expensive salon brands were bad for my hair and scalp. I started using a product called ""Super Hair Energizer"" which was developed using similar theories of hair loss that Riquette proposes in her book. Now my hair is growing back and is shinier than it's been in years and my scalp no longer itches. You can buy ""Super Hair Energizer"" on the internet."
1,It doesn't work,"I was very disappointed with this book. As the other reviewers mentioned, the treatments are expensive to buy, complicated to make, and it stinks. And after all that hassle, I'M STILL BALD!"
3,... hmmm ...,"I was very much taken by the cover shot when I first saw this book on Amazon, the reviews too, seemed rather encouraging ... when the book arrived, I was expecting the rest of the photographs to be of similar or better quality ... am a little disappointed.If this is an instructional book on how to raise or train Labradors, quality of photographs would not be so critical ... but its a pictorial book, and for some reason, quite a few of the photographs are missing that little extra ingredient which makes for really good photography ... perhaps if the photos had been more tightly edited, it might have made a difference ... At US$35 the book is not inexpensive, and there are better alternatives around ... just do a quick search, under photography and Labradors."
5,"A perfect gift for the lab-lover, and a treasure in our","collection. The book is full of great photos paying equal homage to the ""field"" vs. ""English"" labs, and does not disciminate over color. His photography skills capture the personalities of the breed, and the depth of the relationships between dog and handler. The captions are perfect, and some will bring a tear to the eye of even the most stoic of us all.The book is slanted toward field work, domestic life and hunting activities, rather than conformance or obedience work. My husband loved this as a gift, and he is nearly impossible to buy for. All in all, though, it is a beautiful tribute to this remarkable breed."
4,Good everyday running shoe,I use these sneakers for running only. This is my third pair and they haven't let me down yet. I run 3-4 times/week and was able to use my last pair for nearly 7 months. I am very picky about making sure I have ample cushioning under my feet and these seem to hold up for as long as I expect them to. The seams stay in tact - even after running them through sprinklers and puddles. Four stars because they are not the lightest weight sneakers out there...but still light in my book. They are VERY breathable...my feet never get that overheated feeling. Great show wfor the price.
3,imitation?,"Glasses look and feel good but the paint chipped off when swapping lenses. I'm not sure if these are the real deal because they never came with a box and the print on the cloth bag wore off fairly easy. I tried to return them and they said the paint chips weren't covered under the warranty, not likely for a big name like Nike."
1,Racist Book,"Pretty sure this qualifies as throwback, racist, and wrong. Then again, I only read the first 15 pages before I came to this conclusion."
4,not the best but still a good buy,"this cd is pretty good but probably not the best i have. the music on it is really good but it seems like plain old pop, nothing special. i would definitely still get it, though, if i was you.beautiful name 3/5you get me 5/5inside out 4/5love for me 4/5unbroken 3/5wait 5/5feel alright 5/5she 4/5contagious 5/5different kind of free 3/5life to me 2/5"
3,O.K. But ZOEgirl are going downhill,"I've been collecting ZOEgirl since their first album in 2000 and I found them really inspiring and helpful. Self-titled album was good but you could see they had just started. Life was amazing - Brilliant tunes and good lyrics. But then we get this. Different kind of FREE. It has some wonderful lyrics but the tunes are more rocky and that's not my type. Kristin, Chrissy and Alisa are very talented both at songwriting and at singing but all I can say is I hope their next album is better."
3,it's too bad,"To me, this was not one of their better albums. I loved the first CD, but this one was a total let down. there will be a new CD soon, i think it may be already out. I can only hope that they don't dig their hole any deeper, in my opinion, they have room for improvement."
3,"I don't like ""girl"" bands..","..but this one is pretty good! I bought this CD for my daughter and was actually impressed with the music. I think its because this CD has more of a rock tone than other girl bands. The lyrics are high quality, with little repitition. The songs are structured well, generally. The first three tracks are top notch. I'll listen to these over and over again. ""Wait"", track 6, has a good driving piano behind it. ""Contagious"", track 9, is a good high energy song. I give the CD 3 stars since the other songs don't really distinguish themselves. I always find myself skipping over these tracks, which means about half the CD is really good, the rest is listenable but mediocre."
3,Interesting to say the least...,"I simply love the opening track-""Beautiful Name"", and I was expecting some more of that driving ""anthemic"" inspiration. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD tries too hard to be modern and ""new"". Don't get me wrong, the lyrics are really, really great and meaningful. It's just that some of the songs are mixed in an odd fashion, and they have the same ""I wanna be a fast but slow rock song"" feel. Very disappointing, because many of the songs have some awesome potential. Buy the CD for ""Beautiful Name"" and if you're lucky, some of the other songs will grow on you (like they did me). It's experimental, but you may appreciate that."
5,happy I found this book,"after reading this book you start to see life differently, mantion many things in others and within yourself, no metter you take it or not as a truth. I've read many self development books but this isn't one. it's just truth Ron tells you and you have choice to accept it or not. it cleans up your mind and shows things in the real way"
5,Winning Through Enlightenment,Dr. Smothermon has transcended the boundaries of conventional perception of Self - genius! Don't buy it unless your IQ is 150+.
2,sucked.,"I heard about the concepts of this story several years ago: nanotechnology and space travel; nanoagents fight for a scientist whose brain becomes valuable, with devastating affects; the awakening of Betelguese; wormholes -- and I was fascinated. I was RABID for this book. No great scifi writer has yet written a good book about nanotechnology and spacetravel combined, excpet for perhaps A FIRE UPON THE DEEP.But it manages to totally weaken the ending so I just put it down in utter boredom, multiple times, makes the nanotechnology weak and lame, is melodramatic, canned characters, and can make dull the war for our heros body."
1,abba,"Was one of the worst products i have purchased from amazon ,it starts playing and then will stop. Have try playing it in 3 different units .(Give it no star)"
3,good songs. dated videos,I would give the audio content 4 stars and visual content 2 stars for an overall 3 stars. They could possibly have a 5 star performance if they did a reunion concert.
2,Just get The Definitive Collection instead,"With a lot of the Abba product they could release (Abba The Movie, Abba-In Concert, hell, maybe even a solo Frida/Agnetha video collection), Abba Gold on DVD is a copout.This video collects the biggest of the big Abba videos, but wouldn't anyone who wants an Abba video collection go spring for the entire collection. The History documentary is extracts from which is also available in it's entirity on the excellent THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL documentary.Abba is great, but a repackaged inferior video collection is lame on Polygram's behalf."
5,"ABBA GOLD, A FUN MUSIC EXPERIENCE FROM THE FAB 4","I AM A MUSIC LOVER TO THE N'TH DEGREE AND WHO COULDN'T LOVE ABBA. GREAT SOUND IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO ME. I LISTEN TO ALL MY MUSIC, CD'S AND DVD'S ON A GREAT SOUNDING SURROUND SOUND SYSTEM SO QUALITY OF A RECORDING IS A MUST FOR ME IF IT IS TO BE PLACED INTO MY SOUND COLLECTION, OTHERWISE IT IS TOSSED. ABBA GOLD DVD SET IS A FUN VIDEO OF THE GROUP SINGING THEIR SONGS AND THE QUALITY IS THERE. THIS IS NOT A PERFORMANCE ON STAGE, RATHER IT IS THE GROUP PERFORMING IN A STAGED SETTING. UNFORTUNATELY I THINK YOU HAVE TO BUY THE IN PERFORMANCE DVD TO GET THEM SINGING ON STAGE BUT IT IS MORE MODERN DAY WHEN THEY ARE MUCH OLDER. IF YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF ABBA AND QUALITY IS IMPORTANT, THEN ABBA GOLD CD AND DVD ARE A MUST TO HAVE."
5,Abba Gold,"I have loved Abba music since I first heard it in the mid to late 70's. I started buying their CD's to play in my car. Mostly ""Greatest Hits"" I never get tired of listening to them. I would buy more videos but I don't want a lot of the same stuff on each one. I'd like to find some of the CD's or videos with some of their music that didn't make the top 10."
2,please be more careful with the man,"To make it short: this is not Bukowski's best work. And it doesn't have to be. He published over 40 books when he was still alive and all that is released now after his death are the Left-overs. Some are stronger, some are weaker, but one thing is clear: with collections like this one you might scare off future readers because what can be found in this collection is less than average in quality for Bukowski. If you want to go ahead and discover Bukowski (and I strongly recommend that), buy one of his earlier books of poetry like: Burning in water, drowning in flame OR Dangling in the Tournefortia. This is where you find some of the best poems ever written in English. This new book is o.k., but at least wait until it comes out in Paperback..."
4,Exactly what you'd expect,Not for the timid.Not for those who read the reviews of others.Get it.Read it.And grab hold of the life you've got.
3,Not his best...or his worst,"When a new Bukowski book comes out, I buy it right away. Sometimes it's good (like THE NIGHT TORN MAD) and sometimes it's not so good. This one is one of the not-so-good books.I love getting back into the world of Bukowski --- the race track, the alcohol, the wild youth, watching the quiet desperation of Americans --- but this time the magic is gone. For every keeper (like ""Where Was I?"") there's 10 mediocre poems.But hey, I'll be back for the next one..."
4,In my own lifetime,"This has to be one of my all time favorite cast recordings. Although as a Broadway musical it didnt have nearly the success of Fiddler it is non the less an excellent recording,and it did win at least TWO Tonys.(I understand the one that Hal Linden won was one of the reasons that he got the job in ""Barney Miller"".Of course the best number on the recording is ""In my own lifetime"",and ""Sons"" is just slightly chauvinistic but....Hal Linden is of course magical, Keene Curtis does how many roles and Paul Hecht as the oldest son steals the show in his number with Jill Clayburgh. I do know of one piece of music that was cut from the show that I would love to get my hands on,called ""Its just a map"". Well worth a listen!"
4,very good but one flaw,"The main purpose to buying this product was that I needed aS-Video output so I can switch all S-Video in my home theatersystem. $ dollars is a bit steep for that feature, but there are the other advantages, recording at S-VHS quality, the auto clock setup etc etc.Now the best and worst feature... The FF and REW speed is great if you use a T120 tape, it zips through a tape in no time. However our family watches lots of kids video's which are usually 30-45 minutes long. Rewinding these is agony, it is sooo slow. I had to use my old VCR just as a rewinder. I'm not sure why it can't rewind at a normal speed in these cases. If you use a VCR for full length movies and time shifting on T120 tapes then this won't be a problem."
2,"Excellent guitarist, mediocre composer","Though John Michael Talbot's skill in playing the guitar is clear, his talent for composition (as illustrated in this CD) totally escapes me. Much of the music is very repetitive - it seems an accompaniment crying for a melody."
5,Let me just say,"This book wasn't the best short story collection, it's true a couple of the stories were a bit disjointed but Detoured was re-released in an anthology called Secret Lover's so the book must not have been the worst. Author's grow and as readers and I think it's our job to notice that growth and encourage authors instead of chopping them off at the knees. Well, everyone had their opinions, so I was just voicing mine. I just had to put something on this review page because I was shocked to read such a bad review on this book."
4,Pens,What can I say? the are pens that are metalic and the colors are very pretty. four more mords and one more.
3,"It's Moustaki, but not one of his better efforts","Moustaki was not at the top of his game on this one. Aside from Esperance, Bahia, and Calix Bento, the latter of which isn't written by Moustaki, most of the melodies are a bit contrived and forced. Moreover, the songs don't complement each other; there is no unifying mood to the album. The three aforementioned songs blend together fairly well, but the others are dissonant in comparison. Lastly, the lyrics, save on Esperance, are not representative of the best Moustaki lyrics."
5,Thanks Fred!,"Thank you Fred for writing this book. It explains Dr. Sarno's diagnosis in a very simple and easy way to understand. The research information on back pain, some of which even my family doctor had not read about, is so helpful. I am making continous progress following the plan and hope to be win back my complete freedom from back pain soon. I have to second what other reviewers have written: For best results read them both."
1,Rip off,This book promises much and delivers little. Hardly more than a very poor John Sarno rip off. It's unfortunate that Sarnos' name was used since it is the only legitimate thing in the book. If you like to hear someone moan and cry about how everything in their life was related to their sensitive repressed feelings then this book is for you. If you subscribe to the Farenheit 451 theory this book is also for you.(not to memoorize but to burn) Sorry!
1,disappointing,"This guy was a mess and it is great that this approach helped him, but to assume that mind is the cause of all back pain and that conventional methods of treatment never help is narrowminded.While it is important to consider all possible causes of back pain, this book gives many irresponsible generalizations about the causes for back pain and the solutions as well as their results. It pretty much says, it is all in your head and surgery and physical therapy will cure only about 1% of the patients. I don't agree with this and although I kept reading to see what I could glean from the book that might be helpful, I was very disappointed that I spent money on the book.Bravo to the author for curing his problem - I'm just not sure it is a cure for all (maybe not even a cure for most)."
2,Rapid recovery failed,"I was misled when I read the description of this book before I bought it. I wish that the pain I have been experiencing for almost one year now was ""just in my head"" or due to some repressed anxiety. However, the pain is very real and not due to my mind wishing it up. Be very cautious if you are looking for relief of your pain."
1,NOT for people with real physical manifestations,"Actually, NO stars. This book is NOT for people with REAL physical manifestations such as those shown on MRI or Full Body Scan - herniated discs AND a growth on the spine. NOR is the one by Sarno. What a waste of money!"
2,Babbling and ice cream,"After reading this book I thought ""my subconscious must really hate me"" with all the pain I have. Fred gives himself ice cream when his so called manifested pains go away. Putting unnecessary sugar in your body does more harm than good.I do believe the mind can really play tricks on you, but not to the point where Fred goes.It wasn't until I found Kelly starrett that my life truly changed for the better. As a person with a botched back surgery from 1995, no one could or would help me. Kelly was able to break it down and make me realize this was not ""all in my head"".I'm not trying to push Kelly or his methods here, but his methods are real world and work. I don't know about you, but I want less pain through real and solid medical methods.So as much as I would love to eat my way to better health with ice cream, I will stick to what works."
1,Too many instructions,"It is okay if one writes from one's own experience but this went way overboard. One would be better off reading John E. Sarno's work, the true pioneer of mindbody medicine"
2,pedantic,"the author could have made this book into a pamphlet by deleting all of his hypochondriacal verbage. More than half the book is devoted to all of his amazing melange of aches, pains and maladies. Not worth the price."
3,It's alright I guess..,"It's an okay film. Bits of it were interesting, and I generally identify with the left-of-center orientation of it, but I didn't think it was a particularly well-made film. I think my expectations were heightened by the presence of names like ""Noam Chomsky"" and ""Bill Maher"" in it, but in actuality, their comments were marginal in the film. Even the ""extended interviews"" weren't really all that ""extended."" Also, I expected better picture and sound quality than offered.The origins of words like ""idiot"" and ""moron"" are explored; footage of drunk people acting stupid is shown; the harm our stupidity is causing to our planet is noted; the dumbing down of the public by business interests is briefly discussed; and that's it. It was somewhat entertaining, so I wouldn't call it a waste of time. But it's not a ""must see"" or ""must own"" film either."
2,"Good topic, Horrible movie","I was expecting an in-depth discussion of our 'lowest-common denominator' media, but instead it was mostly clips of stupid people doing stupid things. It was more like watching the steretypically vapid MTV show that the moviemakers are trying to expose than anything else. The attacks on George Bush and the Jackass crew were uninformative and unoriginal, even though I don't disagree with the main ideas that these are good examples of people whose job's are fueled by idiocy. Except Noam Chomsky, their 'stupidity experts' that give the running commentary have nothing interesting or intelligent to say.A truly poor film.I'm giving it two stars only because the topic is interesting, but the movie really deserves one star."
4,Stuck on Stoopid,"Can't believe I missed this film when it debuted in 03. It's worth watching - it will make you think. Thinking, real critical thinking may just be the solution to the stupidity in the world or just another excuse, you decide."
5,Southern Comfort,"I bought this recording on vinyl when it was new back in the 1950s, and it is wonderful to see it released in full glory on CD.Mexican music varies widely by region. The music of the Mayab, the deep south against the border with Guatemala, has a totally different flavor from that of the more northern regions. This is the natural habitat of the marimba. Though this album relies on the traditional guitar, the sonorities of the marimba lurk always in the underlayer. The songs are more relaxed and gentle, and the performers here, ""Los Caminantes"" (the wayfarers), handle them to perfection. This is the old Mexican trio style at its absolute best. Altogether, one of the most delightful Mexican albums ever made.[Nota bene: Please ignore the grammatical error in the title. I didn't do that, and I was unable to edit it.]"
5,Amazed,"Where to start, I was a little skeptical at first. I go to the gym four times a week, I'm 6'2 at 205 pounds. At the gym I was always able to get my arms, legs, and abs big and firm. The issue was no matter what I did I was not able to achieve the Toned look. After a few weeks of using the Korflex, I noticed my arms and legs were going from fat looking, to looking toned and aggressive. I can notice my stomach is starting to slim down, I have quite a bit to work through to get closer to my 6pack. In the end, for getting my body toned and ready for a California summer, this is by far the best product I've ever used."
3,Eye Opener 2,The first review below is absurd. This video clearly shows why Marcos was thrown out of the Presidential Palace in the first place - 21 long years of a thieving dictator who stole billions of dollars from his own people and robbed generations of Filipinos their rightful legacy.
3,"Cute, but didn't last","Grand Stable Playset is cute, but didn't last long. Look for something more durable, slightly bigger, better value for money."
3,"A lot of paint, no magic","The Thom Bell magic wanes a bit on Happiness is Being w/ Spinners.The album opens with the light hearted and lyrically banal 'Now That We're Together',a showcase for Henry Fambrough who gets more lead time than usual.The LP version of 'the Rubberband Man' is flippant and dancible,and the jazzy 'Toni My Love' is pure Philly-soul heaven.Spinners#8 is more style than substance,and although new comer John Edwards has his way with 'Heaven On Earth(So Fine),PhillippeWynne's personality is greatly missed.(He went solo in 1977.)"
3,Happiness Is Listening To This Stuff,"If you want pure mid 70's Philly soul magic The Spinners are great ones for that.And certainly the funky ""Rubberband Man"" and ""I'm Gonna Get You"" are fantastic,brilliant tunes but neither of these albums are consistant.Between the two the upbeat ""Wake Up Susan"",the wistful ""Heaven On Earth (So Fine)"" are great tunes but the ultimate Spinners CD collection to get is 'One Of A Kind Love Affair'-it's packed full of great hits and album cuts from their entire 70's career.Much of the time The Spinners weren't really great album acts (say for 1979's consistantly strong 'From Here To Eternally')and these two are certainly no different.I think Philly thought of them as more of singles act and produced them as such.But these guys have wonderful voices and should've been developed in a different way at this point.If they had I think both these albums would've done alot better"
4,Read when I was younger,"I read these books when I was in middle school. I thought they were pretty neat. I would like to say I solved the puzzles, but I am sure I had to look for the answers more than onece."
5,A great set of mini mysteries!!,I couldn't believe how good this book was. I got it because I don't get to play the game much. When I read it was like I was in Boddy mansion itself I could see miss. White cleaning the floors. I also reccomend you seethe movie try to see all three endings!!!
4,Children's songs,The book has more children's songs then I could possible imagine.The Library of Children's Song Classics
3,"Nice Collection,Bad Organization,Terrible Guitar Chords","The book has about 95% of the songs that kids like to sing. So if you're just singing along with the kids and you only want one book this is probably good. But if the kids want to' get down' with just a certain song like right now, finding it fast is a real problem. The songs are collected by theme rather than alphabetical. You have to flip to the index and then back to the music fast,keeping the interest level going can be challenging. The accompanying guitar chords are provided by someone who did not play guitar. It is obviously piano fingering that has been named as the appropriate guitar chord, so the chord voicing is off. You will want to go thru and correct the chords before you try 'comping' with the kids on their favorite tune."
3,"Not a bad book, but definitely not great....","I purchased this book so that I could learn a few tunes for a preschool where I had planned on playing a few of these kids songs on guitar while singing. The teachers/director at the school thought that I should create a CD for the kids to listen to before setting up a date to come out and play for them (so that they would know the tunes). I decided that I would plug the notes/key signatures/time signatures into GARAGE BAND and set up basic piano melodies that I could easily sing to. You know something quick? Well, after creating about 2 or 3 songs I realized that several of the melodies, time signatures, musical notation, and even the notes themselves were incorrect. This is a good book if you want to play a few kids songs THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW, but it is not a reference guide by any means."
2,Just Okay,"I purchased several songbooks to use with my ukelele at the same time. I like the fact that this songbook has so many different songs, but many of the verses and chords are incorrect. The piano arrangements are relatively simple and can be played with little practice, but I found the suggested chords a little difficult to play on the ukelele. I tend to search for songs in Rise Up Singing: the Singing Songbook first when I want to play a song on the ukelele."
5,great for guitar as well as piano,"I was babysitting for a friend and she had this book open on her piano. Several others have mentioned how nice it is for piano, but it's also great if you're a guitar player, even if you're not an expert guitar player! As others have noted, the arrangements are basic enough that beginners (like myself) can play most of these tunes on the first try. It has just about every children song you can think of - from Eensy weensy spider to some nice patriotic ones. If you spend even a little time with children, this book will help you fill your time with music. Great for parents, daycares, camps, caregivers, etc. I came home to order a copy for myself right away."
3,Library of Children's Song Classics,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas -- more for my husband, who loves to play the piano for her. It has quite the list of familiar songs and some we've never heard of. My husband did put up quite a stink at some of the lyrics we thought we knew, but apparently have been updated since the original songs were written... This book contains the originals. ""What does that phrase mean? That's not how the song goes!"""
3,Good but not exactly what I was looking for,"My son who is 2 loves to sing and look at books. We have some other books that have the words to songs that he loves and I was looking for something really comprehensive. So, this is great because it has most of the songs I know plus many I'm happy to learn with the musical notes and chords so I can learn them. However, I was looking for something colorful and attractive - so he can look at the pictures while we sing the songs. This was the best I found but there really needs to be a beautifully illustrated book of songs and these illustrations are very basic and small."
2,"Good Songs, Bad Lyrics","My wife and I found alot of the lyrics to be ""off"" from what we knew as kids. Also, I thought there would be more verses (many times you get the chords/notes and only one verse).As a beginner guitar player playing chords only, I found most all of them to be accurate."
4,A lot of classic songs for the price,"I'm a piano teacher and I'm thinking about teaching voice lessons as well, so I decided to start out with my roommate and her 8 year old son. Neither of them have any experience with singing, so I thought I'd start with some fun children's songs to build their confidence. This book has a lot of familiar songs to choose from, and most are in a very ""singable"" range. There are also a lot of songs that none of us have ever heard of. The piano accompaniments are simple, which is good and bad--it means I can sight read most of the accompaniments easily (less practice time), and there's less going on in the piano part to confuse beginning singers, but some of them leave something to be desired. My biggest complaint with the book is that it isn't spiral bound, making it almost impossible to keep it open on the piano. Despite its few flaws, I'm glad to have added it to my collection."
3,design and modeling cards,"design and acesories cards picture, also and modeling off course. Please give us many picture for more cards and acesories sample picture for cards member. Thank you for your attention. The work and job in member cards for profesional and executive in Indonesians.Kind Regards, Ized Musawa"
3,Pretty good.,"This is a pretty good look at the lives of immigrants coming to America, for whatever reason that brought them there. It points out similarities in treatment among the different ethnic groups, as well as noting the differences in assimilation and access to opportunities.There are essays at the end of each section, first person accounts of the lives of immigrants. These accounts make the book worthwhile.The chapters themselves contain statistical information and items about discriminatory events and circumstances, employment and housing possibilities, and mentions the accomplishments and some well-known descendents of each immigrant group.This is worth a read, especially for the student of the social sciences."
5,It works.,"I bought this two years ago and they both still work fine. They've outlasted the phone. Just note it does say ""Verizon."" I enjoyed having that back on a Sprint phone."
4,Solid tank,"Hey, it's a propane tank ... I exchange it when it's empty for some other tank that's full -- no one ever sees it."
3,"Damaged and/or used tank 1st, New 2nd","Update January 2: I eventually heard back from Amazon.com. They agreed to send me a new tank, which arrived in new condition. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but it looks fine and safe to use. I was instructed to dispose of the old tank myself. I'm not sure what environmentally responsible disposal involves yet, but I'll find out.Original review: Amazon shipped me this ""non-returnable"" tank that has a significant scrape on the tank as if it had been mishandled. The wrapping was torn, and the sticker on the protective valve is missing. It looks like Amazon is selling returned merchandise but advertising it as NEW. Bad business practice. This is the first time that Amazon has let me down. Very poor transaction."
1,No propane! What's the point?,"Nowhere in the product description does it mention that it DOES NOT ACTUALLY CONTAIN ANY PROPANE, and, therefore, ended up being a waste of money. I had to take it to Lowe's to get it exchanged for one that was actually filled. Perhaps I should have inquired in advance, but I didn't even think to do so since Amazon ""recommended"" that it be bought together with my outdoor heat lamp. Boo."
1,EMPTY,"Really should state that it is empty. I paid $42 for a tank I can't use. The propane places in Brooklyn don't refill your tank, you can only exchange the tank. Complete waste of money."
1,Two of three would NOT open.,"this makes me so damn mad. Tonight I had six friends over for steak dinner. Brand new blue rino tank from Ace. Once before I had brought one home and it wouldn't open, and provide gas to the burners. Tonight, using the recommendations from the Ace guys, I opened it reallllllllllllllllly slow! Didn't make a damn bit of difference. We couldn't get a smell of gas from it. Go to the kitchen, get an iron pan smoking up the house when it is 90 ourside, finish in an oven, while the gas grill sets unusable. NO WAY IN HELL WILL I EVER BRING HOME ANOTHER BLUE RINO TANK. This control valve is a piece of junk. Preposterous."
1,THE TANK IS EMPTY,"It must have been stupid of me to assume that this tank would show up with propane in it, but somehow I did. The tank was empty, which makes sense from the safety perspective, but sucks from convenience perspective. I think the product title and description could be more explicit about the fact that it will come empty. I'm sure that the tank is great and all, but it means that I'm not getting to grill tonight, and will have to now figure out where to go to get this thing filled, or worse, I'll have to exchange it for some dinged up tank with gas (goodbye my brand new pretty tank, it was good to know you). Anyway, I just wanted to create this entry to warn others that THE TANK IS EMPTY."
3,it's ok,came razor sharp out of the box but since it's recurved it's a bit difficult to sharpen well. It's light enough to EDC but the handle scales+sheath make it a little bit difficult to conceal in your pants. I put it in the inner chest pocket of my jacket and it disappeared though so it ain't impossible. the pommel holds your grip in pretty well but the tang isn't flush with the handle scales and are a bit sharp. If you file em down though it's ok. the powdered coating looks good and matches the texture of the kydex sheath but it scratches off really quickly.the clip is crap and the chain is crap. they really need to make a steel clip instead of that good for nothing plastic one. You needa small torx bit to take off handle scales/attach clip
4,TANTO BLADE VARIATION KNIFE,"HAS A NICE HEFT IN THE HAND. CAME SHARP. FULL TANG.HOWEVER, IT FITS A LITTLE TOO LOOSE IN THE SCABARDFOR MY TASTE."
3,Worth buying.,"Not bad, but not as good as some of the later albums. Out of nine tracks, at least 6 are keepers. It is worth the money."
2,"great picture, not so great hi-fi sound","I've always been a die-hard sony fan, but after purchasing this VCR and having to return it twice I am no longer as dedicated. The pic. quality is excellent and the machine is well featured but I had trouble with hi-fi sound quality. When using w/home theater setup there was extra undesirable noise introduced into the soundtrack. You could hear a ticking in the background of the soundtrack like the spinning heads inside were somehow adding noise to the audio track. Being a big home theater fan, this was VERY distracting. I ended up purchasing Toshiba's M675 and am very satisfied. They have a new head design that eliminates extra distortion in sound & picture. Overall pic & sound quality is better than the sony too."
3,What did you say?,"I don't know if I received a defective one, but this this is louder than the VCR I have had since 1984! It sounds like a snowblower is outside my window when I play movies. Just my 2 cents."
2,Not satisfied...,"This machine is fine for watching movies or setting up the timer to tape programs while you're out; however, for my taping purposes (trying to tape specific segments of shows) I find it very frustrating. There is no memory function for the counter so I continually need to adjust the tape's position myself, and there is an annoying delay upon pressing record and the machine does not start recording immediately (missing things when trying to hit record on a program coming back from a commericial break when I paused/stopped it). A few other annoying details as well; I will be going back to Magnavox next time."
5,No better VCR in the world for the price,"If you are in the market for a top name VCR, you owe it to yourself to consider this one. Quality, simplicity, and pricemake this THE best VCR you can buy. The picture is crystal clear, even in pause mode. Slow motion and fast fwd are equally clear. Setup took about 10 minutes. If you have a home theater system, put ""Saving Private Ryan"" in this VCR and pipe it through your surround sound speakers. You will feel as if you are storming the beaches at Normandy. You NEED this VCR!!!"
3,Well Made but To Steep and Hard!,"I have reflex. It works great when I don't slide off it. Unfortunately, the foam is hard so I need to put pillows on top to make it comfortable. I knew that when I ordered it from reading other reviews but thought I could live with putting pillows on top. Unfortunately, the slope of the wedge is too steep. Adding pillows on top, makes it even worse. With the pillow, I slide off it every night. All this said. the product is well made. The delivery was fast and on time. The wedge works great to watch TV or read but not the best for sleeping. I would recommend getting the same brand but a lower slope wedge."
5,Health supplies,This order arrived in good time and I am happy with it. My physical therapist uses this same product with me in the office. I am getting a knee replaced and will use this at home. When I don't need it my husband who has esophageal reflux will use it when he needs it.
3,Bed wedge,This wedge is OK. It is not as comfortably as I thought it would be. I really brought for elderly family member. They didn't complain. Eventually got them a hospital bed so didn't have to use this and so I did and didn't like as much.
4,Great cheap alternative to Liberator,We bought two of these as an alternative to the ever popular Liberator. I think this is the way to go! Much cheaper and in our opinion just as effective. Would recommend! Only improvements would be more colors for the cases and we found the wedge to be less firm than we expected.
2,"eh, too high, too hard",I had high hopes for this but it's too high and I would keep sliding down off the pillow. It's also harder than I thought it would be and there isn't any lumbar back support so I need to put a small pillow there to support my back. Would not buy again.
4,"Overall, very good item; but not perfect.","The one that arrived to me was stained, and smelled. So, I have left it in the plastic zippered container. This way I don't have to smell it. Then I put it in the washable blue cloth. It is too hard, so I place 2 small pillows over the wedge. With this set-up, the wedge works very well.I sleep with the wedge, and it helps with GERD. I have had it for a month, and find it works fine. The blue cover is not very high quality. It still works, but I don't think it will for more than a few more months. As compared to no wedge, this works great. I haven't used another wedge like this before, but I would guess that other wedges could likely be much better. However, with the pillows covering the top, it works fine for my needs."
1,Wheelchairs Plus Mobility Solution Inc. Foul-up,"There is basically nothing wrong with the product itself. The problem is with Wheelchairs Plus Mobility Solutions Inc. I specifically ordered white, a neutral color, instead they sent blue which clashes with everything in the bedroom. Everything, order, confirmation, and shipping order all say white, but they sent a blue one anyway. The item is so bulky that shipping it back would be to expensive to justify. Doesn't anybody do their job properly anymore?"
4,worth the $$,very helpful for sleep apnea / acid reflux. comfortable pillow. pretty neat even using it for watching TV
1,Too Hard and Too High.,This this made my back and neck hurt after trying to sleep on it for 30 minutes.Wedge is too hard and high for my taste. I reccomend getting one in person. Amazon was great about issuing a refund. Just make sure you keep it in the origional packaging until you decide to keep it.
4,take a load off,"what a relief! this bed wedge does just the trick relieving my tired, swollen feet and ankles at the end of the day. i bought this one because it was the highest and lesser expensive, and it is just great, can't complain"
4,quick gifts and samplers,"This book is divided into several sections--holiday, kids, animals, flowers, quilts, etc. They are all very simple--I used patterns from this book to teach cross-stitch to beginners. They were unable to complete them in two hours but they did enjoy stitching the designs. I've also used this book to make quick gifts (although some take more than two hours--I think the title just makes it part of the ""two hour"" series). Unlike those books where projects are shown followed by the patterns, these patterns are on the center of the page with pictures of the pattern stitched on the outer edge of the page. They aren't shown so much as completed projects, but I think this helps free the stitcher to decide on how the project should be finished."
3,This is a pure biography,"I bought this book after reading Roger Lowenstein's book 'Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist' (1996) to read on value investing. Unfortunately, this book covers very little about techniques. And I mean VERY little.If you want to get to know the person Graham is, get this book. You can skip this book and still produce superior investment returns (this, known as rational allocation of capital). For value investing, read Intelligent Investor, by Ben Graham.This book gets 3 stars bcoz it serves its purpose as a biography but at the same time managed to discourage me from spending time finishing it, despite my passion for Graham's investment principles."
3,Interesting.....,"I enjoyed this book and I do think that Kenny is a real psychic. It was also written in a very entertaining fashion.I'm just not sure about some of the info Kenny received, such as that Adolph Hitler escaped and died in Austria under a new name until he died as an old man and that Kenny felt that Jim Morrison was not dead.Anythings possible, I suppose.Its definitely an interesting read."
2,Not the greatest oracle...,"When I bought these cards for my brother, I was expecting them to be cards with pictures of all kinds of dragons. Instead, we discovered that the only dragon picture in the deck, is the one seen on the box, and that turned out to be the back of the card. I understand my brother when he says that he can't expand on them like one can with some oracle cards. Dragon Cards have words, giving straight forward meanings, instead of pictures one can elaborate on. Don't get me wrong, these cards may be right for some people. I prefer something that involves more intuitive thinking."
2,Not All There,"Although the motor was the correct part for the repair, the total product received lacked all the pieces necessary for the fix. There was a general purpose connector on the wire bundle but the overall intent was for the wires to be cut and spliced into the vehicle's circuit. At this point, I went to a local auto parts store a purchased their version of the motor kit. This kit contained three separate interconnect assemblies to choose from depending on your vehicle. The motor was identical and the price only 10% more. This items description needs to be a little better regarding the interconnection, or lack thereof. The good thing was the easy return policy with Amazon."
4,Shannon Doherty Rules!!,This is an auesome movie. She plays a photographer. So when someone starts following her and taking her picture things get deadly. Anyone who likes a good drama is in for a treat.
2,Good Cartridge. Bad Price,"The cartridge works fine. ... That's about 25% the cost of the printer. Another thing was how quickly it ran out. After about 25 faxes and 50 sheets of paper, the cartridge was empty. That comes out to 57 cents for each sheet of paper printed.Back to HP. The Xerox is outta here!"
4,Well......,"Here in Calif. the shelf price around here is anywhere from 41.99 to 44.99. I consider the price to be good. It is not worth it to find it somewhere cheaper miles away, you would just waste the gas. It is a good product for the workcenter 490cx. I got about 85-100 pages out of it"
4,Good read to get started and get a good overview,"This book gives a good introduction to argumentation theory and its twists and turns over the course of its existence. I found it helpful to get started, especially coming from a completely different field. It gives the essence of Toulmin and Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca but I would have liked to see a bit more on Austin and Searle.But then again the references mentioned are very extensive and can be followed up. All in all a good book if a bit pricey for students (whatever happened to the paperback cover?)"
1,it melted!!,"I bought this pan 2 years ago, and I just tossed it in the garbage. As far as functionality, it is a little too heavy for flipping crepes, but the low walls make it easy to use a spatula. It distributes heat evenly, which is what you'd want. The outer coating scratches easily, but the biggest problem is that the nonstick coating melted. My husband just used it to grill some peppers and did so at the highest heat setting on the stove. The Teflon coating turned white and literally melted to goo, hence the 1 star rating. It held up well on medium heat for crepe making but the first time on high heat and it became garbage. Somehow I think this should not have happened."
2,Only for crepes?,"I use this pan to cook sausage and eggs about five mornings a week. I have meticulously followed every instruction about heat levels, cool-down, and cleaning. The pan worked fine for a couple of months, but now food has started to stick, even with grease in the pan. The no-stick surface looks perfect, but everything sticks.Maybe this pan is only good for crepes? In any case, I'm going back to my 10-year-old, ratty-looking pan with most of its no-stick surface scratched off -- it still works better than this one! For me, this pan was a waste of money."
4,Birthday dedication pony,This pony was made for the month of September. A perfect gift for a Sept. birthday. She has a special saphire stone for her design and sparkly blue hair.
3,"Beware, Italian Cut!",I ordered this jersey based on the chest size and when it arrived I could barely squeeze into it. It is cut for skinny Italians who have no chest.I sent it back and ordered an American Cut jersey and it felt great.
3,Great Live Performance by a Great R&B Group,"The Spinners at their best, singing one hit after another and a few lesser-known but nonetheless worthwhile tunes as well. Their live performance is energetic and the quality of the recording is exceptional, picking up all the harmonies and subtle tonal ranges sometimes lost outside of a studio. A great CD for Spinner fans as well as a great intro into one of the best R&B groups of the 1970s-80s. Two pet peeves though: 1. The number in which they impersonate other singers is distracting. 2. There's a fade in, fade out right between one of the songs. This is from the original LP when one side of a ""live concert"" record ""filled up"" even though a song wasn't over. It's too bad that couldn't have been eliminated on the CD."
1,Awful.,"I rate the sound quality of this CD is a MINUS 5. It's awful. Also, you get no feeling that this was one concert but actually several pieced together as if the producers were trying to make it seem like one. It seems like a hodge-podge of random live songs. It's just terrible, period."
5,Blast from the Past,"I was absolutely thrilled when I found this little gem hidden in the cyber world...I hadn't played SFII for over 10 years and I missed it...it's just like I remember :) Yay! The SFIII or whatever is interesting...it's a bit short for one player(arcade) mode...but still fun. I'm very pleased with my copy of ""Street Fighter Anniversary Collection"""
5,Been waiting for this one!,I'm 27 and have been a Street Fighter Fan since I was 15 and started playing this in the Arcades. I played SFIII in an arcade during the summer of '98 and never found it again. I really loved that version and am glad to see that it's made it to a mainstream home-game platform. I believe it was also on some lame Atari system that failed the test of time.Anyway...the info that's out on this game sounds GREAT and I can't wait to play it! I was saddended to hear that the bonus rounds have been removed. They were a nice treat and cool throw-back to Final Fight...from whence SFII draws many of it's cool characterictics. Speaking of which...when the hell is someone gonna make an honest and true home version of Final Fight for PS2?! What a classic that game was!!!
4,The Standard,"There are many fighting games out there, but frankly few come close to emulate the technical finesse required to play Street Fighter 3 or 2. Both of which are included here. Sadly the one player mode of Street Fighter 2 is so hard as to be almost unplayable. But the silky smooth visuals of Street Fighter 3 more than make up for it.A must buy for the fighting game hardcores."
2,A blast From the Past!!!,"i remember playing street fighter 2 on super nintendo back in the day. and the collection just brought all of those memories and then some. since i no longer have that particular console. i do have playstation 2. so i decide to purchase it for playstation. i was so surpised at how much the game was like the orginal,plus the hyper edition and etc... i feel if you want to go back in time with this game pick the 15th anniversary of street fighter collection. you can't go wrong."
2,Nostalgic Fans Beware !!,"Being a hardcore gamer since my teen years, I spents hundreds of hours playing Street Fighter II (The World Warrior, Hyper, Championship, Super) and after not playing any version of it in about 10 years I thought that I'd own a piece of history by owning this. Much to my surprise and disbelief, it was nothing like I remember. I thought that I would be able to play all the different versions seperately (much like Tekken 5 has the first three installments)however I was not aware that I would be playing Street Fighter II Super Turbo and I could choose my player from all the different Street Fighter games. It is not what I expected and I think that I have wasted money buying this item, the only redeeming quality of this is Street Fighter III (which I never playing prior) and Street Fighter II:The Animated Movie but still drops the ball in terms of editing and dubbing.If you're a Street Fighter fan, use extreme caution before buying, if not then pass this by."
2,Crappy Street Fighter,This version of Street Fighter sucks. SFA3 is a much better game. This game has little depth. You are better of with the SF collection for the PS1
5,Hidden history,"""Farm Boys"" is a superb work of American oral history and sociology. Author Will Fellows spoke to rural gay Midwestern men of all ages, to draw out, record and give shape to their life stories. The result is a poignant and revealing mosaic-portrait that shows the rich intersections of farm life, gay culture and the American twentieth century. Of especial interest to me were the stories of those men born nearly a century ago - we have so little written testimony of what it was like to live as a gay man ""back then."" And while the subject is gay men, I imagine this book would also be of interest to any reader wanting to know more about rural lives and attitudes in twentieth-century America. Thank you, Mr. Fellows for all your hard work!"
5,Loved this book,I ordered this book because I grew up in a rural farming community in Ohio. I could relate to almost every story in this book....Highly recommend it.
5,Great Book,Thinking As A Science has an excellent chapter on concentration. It also has some wonderful insights as to how we think and how we can improve our thinking. The downside of the book is that the beginning chapters are somewhat boring b/c they deal with methods of thinking that are very scientific. But once you reach the concentration chapter the book is great.
1,Complete fraud,"From web page of company that published this book :""We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. "" Result of this is unreadable book."
4,JOHNNY TEARS IT UP BIG TIME,"i had this lp when it first came out, nothing bluesy about this one, it is in-your-face rock 'n roll of the highest caliber. there are no duds on this disc, just tune after tune of some of johnny's best playing ever. i can't wait until JOHN DAWSON WINTER III is finally released also."
2,less for more,"For the money paid, I could have gotten more from my corner drugstore. The variety of material was checked by my physician and what was there was OK. The problem I have with the kit is there was no advantage to buying it as a kit. I was expecting some savings. What I got was convenience. Shame on me, this time."
5,Very pleased with this kit!,"This medical kit normally goes for about $65, so when Amazon marked them down to $30, it was just to good to pass up! I was looking for a first aid kit to take backpacking, which the Hunter is a little big for.. But that was quickly fixed by one of my favorite things about this kit, it comes with a smaller detachable field kit inside of it! I now use this kit when camping or other activities, and when i backpack, I just take out what I need and put it into the much smaller pouch.The Hunter itself is great, it had everything that was advertised. The book inside is great.. literally covers every injury I could think of in the backcountry! The kit's material is water resistant and very durable. Overall, a great kit; Very pleased with everything!I would recomend going on adventure medical kits website to check out all the different kits (they offer a ton!) and then coming back to amazon to buy them.. definitely cheapest on amazon!"
4,Pocahontas Play-Along,"I had this when I was little and I loved it! I would bring it out all the time and play with the toys that come with it and just play. My favorite part of it was the tape. I listined to it soooo much that finaly my tape player ate it. I Was so mad that I tied the tape back together and listined to it again!! But that wasnt the same. I dont exactly know what happined to it but now all I have is the John Smith toy. I want it so much that Im planing to ask my mom for a new one here! I hope she says its okay. I hope I was usful, bye."
5,Excellent Disney Pastime,"This item is truly excellent and worth the money for its quality and entertainment value.It really is a well constructed and designed play set based on Disney's ""Pocahontas."" The book opens up into 4 quadrants and you tie the front and back covers face to face with the attached ribbon. Each of the quadrants has props that pop up and represent four different scenes from the movie. The set comes with an audiocassette with actual voices and effects from the film in stereo. Included are fully painted characters of Pocahontas and John Smith that you can reenact different scenes in accompaniment to the sound.This set is very similar to the one issued for Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast."" My daughter and I both loved this. We still play the audiocassette to relive ""Pocahontas"" in the car."
3,Dee Dee fans only,"One warning I would give is for Ramones fans. There's basically nothing on here about them. Occasionally Dee Dee will mention something in passing about Joey, Johnny, Marky or Tommy, but as the description mentions, these interviews were conducted for a Johnny Thunders documentary. He does mention bringing ""Chinese Rocks"" to Johnny Ramone & having it rejected cause it was about dope (which seems weird considering their other songs about nazis, child abuse, & huffing etc). Most of this dvd is dope stories involving members of the Heartbreakers (not Tom Petty's): copping, scoring, stealing from friends in the process, ad nauseum. The tattoo segments are interesting. At one point Dee Dee seems to say that it's an addiction like heroin. For me I kind of wish I hadn't seen him this way, but I guess now that he's dead it serves as a warning."
4,A must for all fans of the original New York punk scene.,"Essentially an interview interspersed with some archival footage. I agree with previous reviewer Stacy D'Arc that there could've been more details and topics covered, which would've tied in nicely with his autobiographical book, LOBOTOMY. Nonetheless, there's much to enjoy for the Ramones fan and music historian. Steady talk about dope and references to his contemporaries/collaborators (Johnny Thunders, Stiv Bators). He mentions how Deborah Harry used to carry a horseshoe in her purse to fend off predatory men. I remember the audience, myself included, laughing out loud a lot when I caught this in a small East Village moviehouse the week of our mutual birthday (September 18). Sad to see you go, man. . .You and Joey are always in our hearts. Peace."
3,Dee Dee Ramone-Hey is Dee Dee Home,"Decent Long interview with Dee Dee,nothing major.Would have been nice to get a more in-depth look at his life, Does not go into detail and it is really Sad we Lost Dee Dee,Not To Mention Johnny & Joey as well."
2,Punk Rock Is Not for the Weak?,"""Hey is Dee Dee Home"" is a sleeper hit for Ramones fans only. There are some brief snapshots of the Ramones in their heyday, rocking out at CBGB's (now defunct), some of their music... but other than that, it's a rambling interview with uber-stoner Dee Dee. It's a sad sight. Dee Dee was once wild&rambunctious; with Johnny Thunders,Billy Idol,Sid Vicious&Richard; Hell--now he's so mellow, he's not there (I'm Not There (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)) As a biopic, it's sadly disappointing. Dee Dee recounts living with Debbie Harry ofBlondie - Greatest Hits, but most of the time, it's about scoring dope. The music gets a cameo role. We don't see his family, his friends. He's oddly isolated. Dee Dee was part of a beloved group;he passed away in 2002 (RIP, Dee Dee). This documentary is not merely that of a candle in the wind, but a candle that barely glimmers."
4,The Ramones,"Man...(tear)....Why, why did Dee Dee and Joey have to go? why God? Why?!! We will all truley miss thee! if you're a true Ramones lover like me, get this now!The Ramones will Rock forever! Just like Dee Dee said- They are too tough to die!"
2,myspace.com/barropanama,"this is awful, its just boring stories about heroin, nothing interesting. i was expecting something ubber cool from ramones bad boy. chao, BARRO. COMBATE Fight Club. [...]"
1,Yuck.,"I bought this CD feeling very expectant. It looked so awe inspiring, so uplifting, so mysterious. And it turned out to be so crappy. For those who love the world of electronic music, this is the CD for you. If you're like me, however, and hate how you feel like you're listening to a robot try to make enjoyable music, then don't buy this. I like to know that the music I'm listening to has human error, emotion, ups and downs...... I hear nothing of the man, Robert Rich, in this CD, and it bugs my dear ears tremendously."
2,too dark for me,I only liked a couple of the tracks. The music drags and the synthesized sounds are irritating. Overall very uninspiring.
5,This is a wonderful work.,"This book is by Sylvia Browne's son christopher dufresne and it's such a wonderful work! I love this book because it touches on everything from his mother to his daughter to his wife and everything in between. It's such a wonderful work and I hope christopher writes more, if your looking for a really good book then pick this one up you won't be dissapointed!!"
1,Did Not Enjoy This Book,"I felt it was paying too much homage to a mother he obviously adores, but didn't convey much about her talents and abilities. It felt too much like grandstanding and I really had a hard time getting through the book. Too bad, as I have a great deal of respect for her."
4,MY LIFE WITH SYLVIA BROWNE,When I read a few negative reviews I was hesitant to purchase this book. I adore Sylvia but more to the point ....I feel she is a gift from God and this is what prompted me to purchase the book. I was quite enchanted with the light-hearted way the book was written. I am so intrigued with this family and Chris presented a beautiful picture of different characters. His story-telling wit was quite apparent with every page. The book made me laugh and also gave me a sense of the magnitude of their mission. I was disappointed when the last page was read. This book gave me an opportunity to explore Chris's views and I feel he would make any mother's heart leap for joy to have him as a son. This book truly touched my heart.
5,My Life with Sylvia Browne,"I enjoyed this book so much I could not put it down.I think Chris did a wonderful job of showing Sylvia as a mother,(and a good one at that.}I could relate very well to all the situations and trials of their lives. The love he shows for his family just surrounds you as you read. GOOD JOB CHRIS,I look forward to reading another book by you. This one lifted my spirits and let my soul soar."
4,Excellent first time author,"Written in a stream-of-consciousness conversation manner, Chris Dufresne communicates both his love for his lifestyle and more importantly for his wonderful mother. Surely, every mother would enjoy a book written by their own child praising them for their job well done, but Sylvia Browne is surely a cut above the rest. This fine book describes many candid family stories as well as a few tidbits of philosophy from the viewpoint of a psychic. Writing very much like his mother writes, Dufresne provides a well appreciated look into the life of a boy growing up with an ""extra""-ordinary family. A wonderful fresh start for this fine new author, and hopefully, not his last! Well done Mr. Dufresne!"
3,Great for Sylvia Browne fans,"The content is great. For fans/followers of Sylvia Browne, it's wonderful to get new insight into her psychic family, but also to get to know Chris, who is also very gifted. The style is very stream of consciousness (which Chris warns the reader on P.1), but I think a little organization in the editing process would have made the book easier to read. It really does jump around a lot."
3,My life with Sylvia Browne,"I am glad I read it as it did help me to understand more of his mother. She seems to be an extraordianry person and perhaps I should not have been a little sceptical in my review of her book that I read.However, I would have liked to have learnt more of his own gift and the work he does and a bit less of the praise singing of his mum as nice as that was. Having just read her book, it was a lot of the same.What I want to know is this; do you have to be a christian to achieve perfection and happiness on the other side?My family are not devout Christians but we are spiritual. I have had contact with my son who was killed five years ago. We have not had any urgent messages from him to tell us we are wrong!"
3,Not at all what I thought it would be,"I am a huge fan of Sylvia Browne, and I truely enjoy all of her books. I find her life very exciting and inspiring. I really thought this book by her son would give me even more insight to Sylvia and her life, but it hasn't. I received the book the day it was published, and now two months later, I still haven't finished it. Chris' information may be good, but his writing style has a lot to be desired. There is too much subject-skipping. When I read it, I feel that I'm not ""going anywhere"" with the information. Fragmented... that's a good word for it, and unfortunately, it just didn't hold my interest like I had hoped. My advice: Stick to the books written by Sylvia."
2,Wasn't what I had expected,If you are looking for a good book about Sylvia Browne- this is not the one for you! I guess I was hoping for a few more stories from his childhood. I understand that Chris is a first time author- but I found his writing hard to read bouncing from subject to subject. I also felt that he told a lot of the same stories that I have read in some of his mother's books. If you want some good reading stick with Sylvia.
5,My Life With Sylvia Browne,"Chris's books are an excellent read, I enjoy his way of writing, he is honest and straight forward. You feel like you are sitting down with him and enjoying and family story. He shares many things about both he and his mother. Good job Chris, I look forward to other books from you. Thanks"
3,Good starting point on the Capetian dynasty,"The fourteen Capetian kings produced the founders of or heirs to most of the duchies and counties of France, so this well-written but nontechnical work in fact covers a lot of territory. Royal and noble marriages being political events, a fair amount of meaty genealogy appears throughout (and with the advantage of context). A good introduction for anyone considering the serious study of medieval France."
1,Not A Great Book,"This book was very boring at times. It often paused and just started talking about nothing important to the story. I found this book very boring and an extremely unworthy book to read. I strongly do not recommend this book to all readers, unless you are look for a boring war book about a kid."
5,Very interesting movie.,"This movie shows the complexities of relationships as it pertains to infidelity, trust,and forgiveness from the cheater and the one being cheated on. No one gets a pass when it is okay to cheat. This film shows the unintended consequences of cheating on your partner and who it may affect."
2,Disapointed,"I had hoped for more - movie tedious at times, too much repetition, plot had a little merit, acting was not bad. A bad attempt at being Artsy."
1,SEEN IT ALL BEFORE- BORING,Nothing original in this slow moving film. Some dreadful acting from the female lead that is embarrasing to watch.Not worth wasting your time.
5,Classic in my memory,"I saw this movie in Japan when I was a 13 years old. I watched this film becuase I heard that there were two Dobermanns in it.....25 years later, I am now standing here in life being a Dobermann specialist. My love for the breed never stop growing....I have watched DOBERMANN GANG series previously, and now saw this one. MEAN DOG BLUES is another one that I saw when I was 13~! I have almost ALL movies that uses Dobermann in act. However,I give thia one 5 stars becuase this is one of the original movie with Dobermanns in it that touched my soul."
4,good,this machine works great it is awsom it is cool that you can record from cd to mini disc. I wish that they would make a cd player with a cd-rw but I dowt it will happen. hope this helps you
2,Diasppointed,Three of the six dvds are flawed. I bought this set as a Christmas present and I am very disappointed with the quality of the dvds.
4,He-Man season 2 volume 2,"This wraps up the He-Man series completely, giving you the last half of Season 2.The animation is high quality, produced by Filmation in the 1980s. The packaging is well designed. If you buy all four volumes of seasons 1&2, the DVD boxes will sit side by side on your shelves making up a nice pictorial display on the covers.Now I anxiously hope for She-Ra season 2 as well. If they release that, the entire He-Man and She-Ra output from Filmation in the 1980s will be available on DVD."
3,Easyier then it looks,"I bought this book to get me ready for the postal exam 931. This book does have everything in it, but it is harder then the actual test. Wish more things in this book were on the test. The test covers everything from HVAC to electronics, math to listening to directtions. The book is a refresher and did help some. But it is a little overboard in my opioion. For those who are going to take the test know somethng about everything."
2,Bad compared to the my happiness single,"The metre - a slow ballad, not unlistenable but the type of song you close a concert with before the encorewaiting for the sun - a 'going through the motions' kind of song, a sign of the bad things to come on later releasesNumber of the beast - ordinary song, not sure why bands continuously want to cover this songOdyssey #3 - slow filler song, would have been good on the album as a bridge bewteen songs, but as a b side it just does not fitWhatever makes you happy (piano version) - serviceable song but at just over 2min very short.Overall poor single compared to my happiness but i guess they saved the best songs for the best single."
3,Somethin' 4 Da Honeyz / This Is How We Do It - Montell Jordan,"Canadian CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""SOMETHIN' 4 DA HONEYZ / THIS IS HOW WE DO IT"" - MONTELL JORDAN1) S4DH (Radio Version) - 4:022) S4DH (Human Rhythm Remix) (with Redman) - 3:573) S4DH (Human Rhythm Instrumental) - 3:574) TIHWDI (Studio Ton Radio Mix) - 3:425) TIHWDI (Funkmaster Flex Radio Mix) - 4:336) TIHWDI (Puff Daddy Radio Mix) - 4:231995"
3,Funhouse,like most of his(dean koontz)older books they are just chase and run but the suspense can't match with any other author
3,Not too bad!,"I have read better books by Dean Koontz. Well, it is one of his early books and he was still practicing then. The idea is very good, and I liked the carnival setting (which he will use again in Twilight Eyes, a far better book). But the characters and their actions are sometimes not really credible. Liz is a fictional character that would not survive long in reality. And Amy's motivation to follow Liz is also not realistic. But the story is full of suspense and a good read in your armchair or on the beach."
3,Average,"Not too impressive as far as Koontz goes. Fairly exciting, but sometimes read like a B movie script. I didn't dislike it, just wasn't as impressed as I have been with some others of his."
2,Too long for me!,"I'm only thirteen but love Dean Koontz,I think this was the only book I didn't like.He didn't make real clear what was going on in the begining with the baby and the drunk woman.I don't recomend this to younger readers but mabey if I was older I would like it and understand it more then I would give it a better rateing."
4,Something more fun may be in the house,"An early thriller, recently revised. One of Dean's carnival stories. Not his best, but nonetheless interesting. Perhaps a bit prurient at times, it has the pace and excitement Koontz fans have come to expect."
5,"this is a great book, its so real",I think everyone should read this. It is a great book and you will not be able to put it down once you start reading it.
4,Suspensfull and chilling for a carnival lover.,"If anyone ever had a fear of carinval people they will after reading this book. Koontz had me screaming and in suspense thoughout the book. He does get a little far fetched at the end with reality, but the entire book was well worth the time and effort spent to read it. Hope you enjoy the Funhouse as much as I did."
3,I hope much more horror...,and its argument is predictable... but I like it... 'cause there is something in its pages that I can't describe.
2,Not a good representation of Koontz!,This is one of about 10 of his books I have read. I have greatly enjoyed his other books but this one seemed very shallow. Normally he writes extremely well thought characters - on both sides. But with this book you couldn't understand anyone except maybe the little boy. Don't read this as a first time Koontz. He states he wanted to show the reality of the carnival life - he does that okay but fails with the people.
3,Finally,"I have started to read several books by Dean only to stop when the train of thought wonders to a newspaper ad or a flier. The Funhouse was good, and easy to follow. It seems that his earlier works are easier to read, not a lot of details, more like a fiction story, and less than 400 pages. I have started to read more of his stuff starting from 1972. Am having a problem finding ""Chase"" in ""good to very good"" condition. ""Shattered"" is next."
2,Third-rate book from a first-rate author,"Dean Koontz was hired to write this book from the screenplay of the teen horror flick of the same name. Shallow boring movie = shallow boring book. This is not typical of Koontz at all, and we can only hope he has learned not to translate screenplays for a quick buck (and put his name to it)!"
4,Slasher movie....erm.....book,"This book was adapted from a slasher movie screenplay and it shows. Although Koontz has managed to craft a fine novel it still can't quite shake those roots. I also found the carnival setting to be somewhat superficial with not much bearing on the story excepting the clowns are scary, carnivals are creepy dynamic. If you want to read Koontz's ""real"" carnival book pick up Twilight Eyes."
1,Did Dean Koontz let RL Stein write this?,"Koontz's books are one of my big guilty pleasures. ""The Funhouse"" was as well-written as a ""Goosebumps"" tale, and as scary as R.L. Stein's most gentle paperback. The author readily admits that it is not his strongest piece, which I think is all more the reason to skip this one.The characters are characatures, the dialogue is laughably ridiculous, the descriptions... the book was terrible. You never once care about a single character, and Koontz typically has a gift for making you care."
2,Shockingly bad...,"I'm usually a big fan of Koontz but this offering is dire.It's so badly written/plotted that it's still hard for me to believe that he actually wrote this.The plot is wafer thin and predictable, the characters lack depth and the conclusion is woeful."
4,Good,I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It's kindof a typical slasher but is way better than watching a movie in that catagory.
4,Four Star Review,"The Fun House, is one of Koontz best works. Of course we seen Odd Thomas and the other great books, but this one is among the best of Koontz' works. I think beyond a doubt that the thought and devotion in this book has really paid off and will continue to do so. I enjoyed this book, which kept me glued to it's pages one by one, as the author told the story so well. I give The Fun House a four star for it's intriguing detail and articulation. But don't take my word for it, buy it and find out what it's pages hold."
4,Funhouse is a fun little book,"I have loved every single one of Dean Koontz books, and I will never have anything to say about his novels. This may not be one of his best works, but even at that...Its still a great read. It is a fun and quick read and would be a wonderful book to curl up on a rainy Sunday with and relax!! I do recommend this book!"
3,One of Koontz' best early novels.,"This was one of Koontz earlier novels in this current genre. He does well with character developement and his imagery is very full. Although it is not his best, this book is definitely worth the read."
2,"Alright, but NOT one of his finer pieces","Was a good thriller, but I give it two stars because I consider myself a God-fearing person who is a strong believer in justice, and I found it horrifying that a woman who murders a baby and then forces her own daughter to have an abortion gets away completely scot free. But overall, not one of his better pieces"
2,Koontz's only novelization is a poor example of his work.,"In interviews Dean Koontz has stated that as a child he fantasized about running away with the carnival/circus and his obsession with it led to one of his best books, The Funhouse isn't it (I was actually referencing Twilight Eyes). What The Funhouse is is an excellent example of why Koontz makes a poor sell out. Written before his megabestsellers, The Funhouse is a novelization of the Tobe Hooper horror movie. Anyone who has seen the movie knows that the screenplay isn't exactly the strongest of material to build a book with, so Koontz added some background details and the result reads like an entirely different story. Originally published under his Owen West pseudonym, The Funhouse is one best left on the shelf."
2,UGH!,"Dean Koontz seems rather obsessed with sex, and all of his books have VERY similar topics.The characters were very phony, to me, I don't think he's especially good at writing a credible female character. The plot was interesting, however, which is why it deserved 2 stars rather than 1.If you're a die-hard Koontz fan, obviously you are going to read it no matter what, but if you're not, and you are just looking for a good read, I suggest you look elsewhere."
2,Some good points but mostly worth passing by,"When I first started reading this book, I was unaware that there had been a movie released as well. I remember thinking ,when I was reading it, that if it was a movie, it would be REALLY bad. I feel that the plot carried itself and it did have some ""on the edge of your seat"" sequences but over all it left me feeling a little cheated. All but one charecter (Amy Harper) were very one dimensional. The gruesome horror descriptions were out of context for the rest of the book. I couldn't decide if this was a horror story, a religious awakening or an after school special. Overall, the book keeps you interested enough to keep you reading (it is a very easy reading book) but it also leaves you looking for more. I'll wait a while before reading another Koontz book after this one."
1,This is Koontz??,A B-grade effort from Dean. His afterword does excuse the thrown-togetherness of this book. It's very predictable and rather boring actually.
1,One of the worst books I've read this year!,"My first Koontz novel was a big let down. It reminded me of a summer teen horror flick. After all I've heard of Dean Koontz I really was expecting more than this. Hopefully, his other novels are a big improvement over ""The Funhouse."""
4,Thrilling,This is one of his better books I think. He keeps you interested and lets you run with your imagination. He does not make the whole book about detail and the plot I thought was very intriguing. Koontz yes has better books out there but I think this one would be a great read you never want to put it down.
1,Isn't This The SAME EXACT Plot as the Movie????,"About a year ago I found a great novelization of the movie ""The Funhouse"" at my cousin's house. I can't remember who wrote it, I think it was Owen Wilson, Owen West, something like that. Anyway it was very different from the film, and was about a woman who flees her husband and this grotesque, evil child she gave birth to with him. Years later she has a new husband and two children, and her eldest daugther spends the night in the funhouse with her friends and is hunted down. I can't remember the names of the characters, and I can't remember all of the events from that point on, but it sounds to me like the SAME EXACT plot??? Is this for real? What I know of Koontz has been very good, but this sounds like nothing short of copyright infringement to me! (Incidentally, the book and movie are worth checking out!)"
3,Russian music but heavily westernized...,"Lovers of Russian choir music with a deep, mystical atmosphere will be sorely disappointed by this music. Although the lyrics are Russian and Orthodox, the melodies and vocal arrangements are Italian and some of the pieces sound like a parody of Monteverdi's Vespers of the Virgin Mary.This is explained in the booklet that comes with the cd. It has apparently a lot to do with Peter the Great's westernization drive. He had Italian composers come over from Venice to alter the traditional church music, which he apparently deemed backwards. The result is beautiful but devoid of depth, except maybe for the fourth track, a hymn to the Virgin Mary, which sounds like a litany and is quite soothing and religious in tone.The rest is for me pure profane music only intended to please the ear."
2,Russian Orthodox Singing? Not!...,"Beautiful choral music devoid of true Russian soul. Westernized to a degree of being unrecognizable. It comes from the ""western"" school of Rusian choral art and has nothing in common with the prayerful and deeply spiritual dimension of the Orthodox faith."
3,This album is not about the message teens should hear.,"First off, I'm sure everyone thought the name of this group was called ""Splackavellie"" and not ""Pressha."" Second of all, that song talks of affairs and betrayal. I have a friend, Justin Hughey, who keeps betraying me and he should get his act together, or he will lose a friend."
5,Book Purchase,I purchased this book as a gift for a family member. The book was exactly as described. The product was used but in very good condition and delivered in a very timely manner.
5,Theodore Roosevelt is Relevant Today,"With all the discussion of what role government should play in monitoring business, especially big business, Theodore Roosevelt is relevant. Reading his views on why there should be oversight are as relevant now as they were early twentieth century.Other areas that are just as relevant include 3rd party candidates, patriotism and individual responsibilty. Reading this book helps bring on reflection and discussions that can be much richer than focusing on the latest soundbite."

1,wrong temperature,"I bought two of these ""143 degree thermostats"" for my twin engine boat. The only problem is they don't open until much, much hotter. I tested them in a pot of hot water after my engines moved into the red on the temp gauges. The thermometer I used for testing maxed out at 190 degrees, and the thermostat didn't open until well after that. I don't know the exact temp, but it had to be over 200 degrees since there were gas bubbles forming on the thermostats in the water before they opened."
4,"Bizarre, interesting, strange, engrossing","One of the strangest books I've ever read. Protagonist Praxis is infuriating, exasperating; she floats in a strange sea, and her choices are almost always wrong. The characters are duplicitous, self-centered and bizarre. The book wasn't always enjoyable but I admire its peculiar challenging style."
4,Read this and enjoy,"Praxis bij Fay Weldon is as much light as it is unsetteling. It referes to old knowlegde as well as to new adventures. To a need to be secure as well as the need to be free and uncommitted. It's not the story that's so special (an old woman looking back on her life, how she grew up (bizar indeed) the 'choices' she made) but the way it's written is special, almost poetry. And though Fay Weldon breaths seventy's moral and the feminisme of last century, stangely to me the story is not out of date, although I read it first 20 years ago."
2,What was I thinking?,"Fay Weldon is one of those authors I love to hate. I keep reading them just to see how bad they really are. Praxis is such a quirky, odd character that you keep reading just to see how bizarre things can really get. It goes beyond my definition of bizarre, but don't take my word for it...read it for yourself!:-)"
2,"Go north, young sponge!","OK, basically this is best only for young kids who are diehard spongebob fanatics. You roll a direction die and cross a board to get to the Krusty Krab while avoiding being stung by the giant jellyfish. The only reason I took the time to write a review is that my 5 yr old and 6 yr old developed a solid understanding of North-South-East-West directionals from the markings on this board and the directional die. The game didn't last very long at our house, a week of heavy play then a few months of occasional play, but they both are aware of compass and can find NW NE etc. on regular maps now."
5,"A Warm, Fluffy Treat","I have really enjoyed this blanket. When my daughter first came home, we swaddled her in this until she was about 6wks old (the weather started to get too warm for it then). Now that the weather is getting cooler again, I have been putting it on top of her to sleep. It keeps her very toasty throughout the night in our old, drafty house, but is light enough that she can kick it off if she gets too warm.This blanket has gone through the wash many times and it remains beautiful and soft. It has really held up well and been very useful. I would definitely recommend it."
1,Do not buy,"It does not even deserve ONE star. This is my second Acer. The first gave me fits and I gave it away. This one did much the same thing and then the hard drive died...all within 6 months. Support was awful (try being on hold up to an hour). Repair is awful...got my laptop back in 2 weeks even though I paid for overnight return. In less than 2 weeks I got the same problems that I had before the first hard drive failure. Their answer? Send it back for repair. I am sorry, if they cannot fix it the first time why would I even let them have it a 2nd time? No exchanges, refunds or even a loaner. My business depends on having a reliable laptop for travel. I spent over well over $200 (on top of the purchase price, not to mention the aggrivation of backing up, restoring and reloading) for WHAT? VERY poor customer service. VERY poor repair service. If I ran my business like theirs I would no longer be in business."
2,not what I wanted,"Though what the description promised, when it arrived it was not what I wanted and looked cheap and cheezy."
3,Fair,The shade works but not near as well as I expected. I took pictures at a classic car show last week (bright sun) and cut off some of the cars by about 1/10th of the car. Very disappointing product. Also the price of the shade was five dollars and some cents and the shipping was five dollars and some cents. Bad news! Never again!
5,It took me back to Iceland!,"I had the pleasure of residing in Iceland for a year (Aug 96 to Aug 97). I loved Iceland beyond measure. 'Prayers of St. Brendan' took me back to the cliffs of Vik, the sprays coming off Gullfoss, and amid the winds where the voice of Vikings can still be heard. This masterpiece is purely sensual and essential!"
3,Well....,"I must say that after hearing Celtic Legends, I was a little disappointed in Prayers. The music was still beautiful and I was taken aback by the words, however, I prefer Jeff's music without the main vocals. Granted, background vocals add to his beauty of music but I would have preferred less. Still, a good CD to own if you love Celtic music."
3,Hit and miss,"Those of us expecting more great music as presented on Johnson and Dunning's last release ""Music From Celtic Legends"" can be only partially satisfied. The instrumental work on this release can be uplifting and mystic, but the inclusion of Jeff Johnson's vocals, although competent, lessen the album's appeal. Johnson's vocals make the album sound more like a Michael W. Smith release, (nothing at all wrong with MWS), than what we've come to expect from Johnson and company. Disappointing to say the least."
2,A disappointing hybrid of musical genres,Expecting a celtic work? You won't find it here. Rock? This isn't really rock. Christian rock (a contradiction of terms)? No. The textural keyboards capable by Johnson? Not consistently. This work just doesn't fit. A mismatch from what you would expect from the Hearts of Space label.
4,Yolanda at Christmas,"Each Christmas I buy music from a genre that is relatively new to me. This year it was Yolanda Adams, and I'm so glad! Delightful and inspiring!"
1,Christmas Ruined,"Born this Day, the song is quite beautiful so I was upset when I heard- ""Christ The Lord He's God the Father, God the Son and Holy Spirit [Jesus]."" This is all sung on the song as one phrase. Note, the ""Jesus"" at the end is in the audio but not in the lyrics I found online.Christianity teaches that Jesus Christ IS God, but NOT that He ~is~ the Father, NOR that He is the Holy Spirit. Yolanda is teaching the ancient heresy called ""modalism"" which is rejected by Christians of every stripe... protestants, Roman Catholics, Anglicans, Eastern Orthodox....Her doctrine destroys the importance of Christmas itself because if true we would no longer have the incarnate Christ, our great High Priest interceding for us. There are other implications, but that particular one seems to kill the meaning of Christmas itself."
5,I highly recommend this CD,Yolanda Adams' Christmas CD is simply beautiful. I love the arrangments of all the songs on this disc. I can listen to the whole CD over and over again. Her rendition of The Christmas Song is my favorite. You will not be disappointed with this album.
2,"amazing detail, weak analysis","The McGillivray and McIntosh Traders: On the Old Southwest Frontier 1716-1815This book is full of genealogical detail resulting from 20 years of research, but it is weak in analysis, fails to put the subject in the context of current understanding of Native American societies in the Old Southwest, and shows little knowledge of the Scottish clan system from which these traders came. It provides leads to rich documentary sources, but is a means to understanding rather than an end."
4,One of the best volumes on Alexander McGillivray to date,"This is one of the most fascinating books I have read on the subject of Alexander McGillivray and his family. New theories on his death with strong arguments and documentation give new insight on his impact and influence on the Creek Nation in regards to the Spanish and their distrust of him. Alexander McGillivray has long been overlooked as a great Indian Chief, trying to keep peace in the Creek Nation while keeping the powers of the Spanish, British and Americans at arms length."
2,Just do it.,I am not sure if I liked this book or not. Tom Watson writes like so many others about the importance of the short game. He is right and I tried hard to like this book because it is short and simple. I dod not like the illustrations. They were boring like so many of golf books from that period (and it wasn't more than 15 years ago). I would not buy it again.Get Pia Nilhson's book instead.
3,Disappointing Reissue,Disappointing ReissueYou would have thought BGO would have remastered this gem when they reissued it in 2003. I assumed they did and dropped $20 to buy it. Very disappointed. Sound is virtually identical as the Sony 1989 release (this version has a slightly deeper bass sound).SOMEBODY PLEASE REMASTER THIS!!!!!
2,Poor CD Quality,"I ordered the Edgar Winter CD ""Roadwork"". The product arrived slightly later than expected (no big deal), but the CD doesn't play properly on any of my players. It skips on almost every song. There is no visible damage to the disc, so I suspect it is an inherent defect. Fortunately, I was able to rip CD, so I do have a copy."
2,It Was Live,This album for sure sounds live.There apparently were no studio touchups.The way a live album is supposed to sound.But the songs selected are for particular tastes only.
5,Great album,I saw this band in 1973 about when the album came out. Great music and the concert was just as the album is played. Love it!
5,Rigoletto,"This version of Rigoletto was wonderful-the music of course, and the performances. Pavarotti is in great voice. The movie-like staging for the most part is good. This is not a recorded stage version; it is a filmed version especially for the video."
2,Best for newbies,"I showed this at my opera club, and only the newbie was happy with it. Yes, the sets are gorgeous and evocative, and the singing was very good. But this DVD suffers from the choice of the director to do so many closeups. Pavarotti's voice can still make you want to close your eyes in ecstasy -- but he plays a blustery, overbearing Duke, making it hard to see why Gilda falls for him. (There's already precious little in the libretto to make the Duke sympathetic, and Pavarotti doesn't use what's there.) He has a disconcerting way of opening his eyes VERY wide and not blinking. It would be easier for the viewer to maintain an illusion of young lovers if the camera were moved back a bit from *both* romantic leads... Gruberova's voice is accurate, but after hearing the rich, plush young tone of Desiree Rancatore in the recent San Francisco Opera production, it's just not the same. Overall, well sung and well set, but ultimately unsatisfying."
4,Rigoletto Opera by Verdi,"I think this opera contains Verdi's best tunes.This productionis very spectacular and dramatic with much outdoor action. Top class performers of course, though a prettier soprano could have been better.For adult viewing only because some parts are fairly raw."
4,Great sets and singing,"First the disclaimer, I'm not expert.I really enjoyed it, the music is great and the acting and singing of the masters is always good (unless you are a real critic sensitive to nuances imperceptible for us mortals) The four stars is because I belive it could have looked better. Dont leave the following discourage you from buyint, it is still worth it, Im just explaining why I didint give the 5 stars. The transfer to digital could be better. Maybe it was done at a time when TV screens were smaller and blue-ray was not a reality. Even for a DVD it could improve, this is a suggestion for new editions."
4,wonderful acting of Regoletto,"Yes, the acting of Regoletto shines all the way through this film/opera. The filming is also good in terms of at 80's. Pavarotti truly showed his 'golden' voice in this production. Worth to watch it.Only one thing I am not perfectly satisfied which is the recording. The orchestra sound isn't the best, especially at the loudest parts. I think maybe the recording engineering didn't set the 'peak' volume right. (maybe I am wrong, no offense here)"
3,Ill conceived film mars good music,"The performance of the singers and the orchestra on this DVD is quite satisfactory. The pretension of the film maker takes this down sevral notches. For example, one cannot enjoy the overture for the symbolism imposed from the end of the drama. This pretentious flashback is quite distracting. Similar criticisms hold for characterization throughout."
5,Don't miss it!,"Rigoletto is one of my absolute favorite operas, and this DVD version made it even better!The cast is perfect, at least when it comes to singing, but I just can't stop LAUGHING at Edita Gruberova's infernal gestures and behaviour... Maybe Gilda is supposed to be a bit stupid and naive, but Gruberova's playing is almost parodic.But it's not any worse than that it makes you laugh.I have no complains to the rest of the movie. Wixell is just as good as an actor as a singer, and I don't think Pavarotti acts too bad either. But anyway, you forget his bad acting when you can hear him sing!"
2,in a word - terrible!,"This one will appeal to neophytes who uncritically swoon over Pavarotti's mannerisms and don't know any better. To call this poor ""performance"" of one of Verdi's great operas even ""adequate"" (except for Gruberova), much less ""great"", is a sign to go back and do more listening. Avoid this turkey. Pavarotti is his post-70's below-par, trying-to-compensate-by-mugging worst. Wixell tries hard but is just not up to the role that was so superbly performed by Warren or Gobbi. Ponnelle's direction is bizarre (as usual). For a better sung and more honest performance, I recommend the English National Opera video. Ok, it's sung in English and updated BUT the singing is superior on all counts, the translation is workable, and the updating doesn't violate the spirit of Verdi's drama."
4,Rigoletto-Pavarotti-Wixell,"This is a strong production filled with beautiful and dramatic singing, and Wixell's playing a dual role tightens the story. Some artistic lapses in the directing are made up for by the exceptional final act."
3,Fonomímica,"Compré con mucha ilusión esta ópera pensando que la podría ver y oir grabada en vivo. El desfase entre el sonido y el movimiento de la boca es casi imperceptible. Pero es inequívoco que un doblaje carece de la expresión instantánea de los cantantes y del público que, para mí, es parte de la música en cada función. La fonomímica quita la magia que el teatro le da a la ópera. No es ni cine ni ópera. Inclusive debo subir demasiado el volumen para sentir a gusto lo que estoy disfrutando con el oído. Ernesto González Roberto"
4,Long live HD DVD!,"It's sad, HD dvd has died a premature death.I don't think it was given a fair chance against Blu Ray( Warner Bros and Walmart saw to it).I always had this sneaky feeling that Toshiba knew the end was near and began to cut back on production costs(look at the company's HD-A35 as compared to HD-XA1,XA2).The HD-A35 was built to a price and it showed.As for the HD-XA1,pictures never did it justice.You must see it for real and you'll appreciate what the market is going to miss.Picture quality is superb.I use a Sony full hd lcd tv and maybe the Sony actually flatters the HD-XA1.If you can put up with the minor problems(long bootup,firmware updates)go for it."
4,Great High Definition player,"I've owned this player for over 1 1/2 years and after the initial firmware updates it has been flawless and even quicker to load now (which was one of it's largest drawbacks).I know you've read the so called complaints about it only out-putting 1080i signal, but if you have a quality 1080p HDTV it just de-interlaces the signal and you see a full 1080p picture anyway.I'd have given this 5 stars but it still is just a little slow to start-up, not real bad just slower then a regular DVD player is.I own both a PS3 and this HD DVD player and while I really like my PS3 my XA1 still delivers a better upscaled picture of regular DVDs (not huge but still better).Most of the negative reviews are just Blu-Ray supporters posting with hidden agendas or people that were not aware of the need at first for firmware updates or the few problems with early HD DVDs and combo DVDS and got impatient and frustrated."
2,NO Pictures for HD DVD Disc.,"This is the second set I bought, the first set is HD-A1SN. I have problems with both sets. When I tried to play my HD-DVD Discs, I received 'a blank' on my TV screen. My TV is a 32"" Philips LCD HD-Ready set having 1366x768 pixels. But I have no problem playing other ordinary DVD Discs. I believe I need a software update. I wrote to Toshiba but so far have received no response after more than one month. I am tired of waiting."
4,very nice,"I liked the movie, it was really sad, so was the music, it sent shivers down my spine, especially the hanging. Dramatic, powerful, and beautiful"
1,"1st tune ""not"" on Soundtrack","Hello , I was disappointed that the 1st tune played in the movie ""Return to Paradise"" had not been entered per Soundtrack .Thank You ,Klay"
3,"More about decorating with plants, than actual flower gardens","I was hoping for a book with lots of flower garden photos and design ideas. More about what types of plants do well where. I think there were maybe 10 actual garden photos, the rest were flower arrangements and ideas for what to do with the flowers FROM your garden. Many photos didn't even identify the plants pictured. One specifically comes to mind, of a porch with a lovely hanging plant and others containers of bright pretty flowers in containers that I would have loved to know the names of.Can I use any of this information for the flower garden I am working on in my yard? Sadly, no.Big disappointment."
4,Great introduction to Soul Retrieval,"Sandra provides an excellent introduction to Soul Retrieval and other core Shamanic principals. This is an excellent resource for anyone studying Shamanism or interested in restoring personal power into their life. Is also a nice complement toThe Spirits are Always with Me: True Stories and Guidance from a Modern Shamanby Jane Shutt, which provide more depth on this important topic (and of course to other books and CDs by Sandra Ingerman)."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Unless you have never even thought about cultural spiritualism before, you will find the content of this audeotape to be completely amateurish and shallow.Even if you enjoy the content, the painstakingly slow delivery and annoying voice will drive you crazy.I struggled to listen to the entire tape hoping it would pick up at some point, but the hope remained unfulfilled to the final droning comments."
1,Rip off,"This is a burned cd, did'nt play on my cd players, should have had a warnining that it might not play on some cd players"
5,With the Intensity of a Star,"Bei Dao's poems gleam like white dwarfs. Each poem bears the intense pressure of its own inner light. They are compressed songs, wrestling with terror and beauty, politics, metaphor, home, exile. The poems exist in that moment of being on the verge, an expectancy. They exist in that moment of waiting that can only be human hope, ready to glow despite the forces that try to thwart it."
4,Beck in the saddle again...,"This is a fine early 70's effort from the second (or maybe third) incarnation of Jeff Beck and his merry sidemen, and has aged surprisingly well. One can sense Beck's slight turn toward the jazz leanings that would soon become his forte,although he is still hanging on to his rock/blues roots on this set. There is some interesting diversity on ""Rough & Ready"", everything from the heavy riff rock of ""Train Train"", the jazz-rock leanings on ""Situation"" and ""Got The Feeling"", to the beautiful and ethereal ""Max's Tune"".The album features fine drumming from the late Cozy Powell and outstanding playing overall from the musicians involved. I hope this CD is next in line for a proper remastering, a la ""Truth"" & ""Beck-Ola"" (July 2000 reissue versions)--it sorely needs it!"
5,One of my favorite 5 albums of all time by any artist.,"I just love this album, and I've heard many. ""Jody"" is my favorite cut, then ""I've been used"". It's a great group of musicians and a fantastic album. A gem!"
4,Nice Return of Jeff Beck Group,"While this is not as good as the Orange album (the follow up to this album), Rough and Ready is a wonderful album from the Beck Group. Jody is perhaps one of the best tunes on the album-it's a great rock song that still remains timeless.The musicianship on this album is marvelous. Of course, Jeff is the best player on the album, however Max Middleton and Cozy Powell are good partners for Jeff. They are excellent musicians in their own right. Overall, this is a good buy. If you're looking to save money, though, get the orange album instead, or if you want a better album from this incarnation of the Jeff Beck Group."
3,Got the Feeling,Not as i remembered it from when I had the vinyl.Seems more blues jazz than rock.1 2 3
3,rock trying to roll some other way,"It's odd that after the Yardbirds, Jeff stopped rocking for a long time, perhaps until Beck, Bogart, and Appice. This is one of his albums that doesn't rock. It fusions or funks instead. In retrospect you can feel Blow by Blow coming. It's not bad music, and the band is powerhouse, but you have the feeling of something transitional and out of the loop. Plenty of tasty guitar, though, and I think Jeff pretty much holds back the double-tracking and overdubbing here and gets a nice almost live sound from the guitar."
4,Just as described,The book was just as it was descripted in the posting. I'm sure that my daughter will find it to be a useful resource in her studies.
5,A great book from the basics to the advanced.,"I really enjoyed this book and give to aspiring walkers. It really makes a nice connection from ""walking"" to Racewalking."
3,family fun,these are cute. Cute is the work. Funny and lighthearted entertainment. I wish some of the current stuff was even half this good
2,Famous Fluff,"If literature is a plate of food, this book is the parsley garnish; best pushed aside to get at some real sustenance. The writing is ""clever"" enough, as advertised, but empty. The only thing more important to the Lucinda character than the endless listing of designer labels is her self-absorbed ramblings. ""Clever"" might cut it for a short plane flight but I actually think that Ms. Wolper could do a great deal better if she would just go deeper. Maybe there was supposed to be a play on the ""shallowness"" of Hollywood by keeping the insights at a chatty level. Nothing here to sink your teeth into at all."
3,Fun. Feisty. Frivolous.,"A witty and strangely mesmerizing insider look at the lives of the rich and famous. Lucy is the chef for Mr. Famous and is privy to his insecurities and egocentricities and those of the sycophants that hang around him. I liked Lucy a lot. She's smart and self-depreciating and quick with the one-liners. A light, effortless read. Perfect for a beach or on the plane."
1,Major RIP OFF,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT it is nothing more than a trailer!! If you want to watch the video just go to you tube for the full 20 minutes of action (the whole thing only lasts 23 minutes including credits).
4,Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Alpha,hope there will be more episodesas this was too short for a storyother wise it was very good and showed training is a key factor
5,Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Alpha,"Absolutely fascinating!! Watched it several times, took it to my grandson to show him and my son-in-law watched it too. They LOVED it. I wished it had been a full blown movie, it was so exciting to watch. Better than just about any movie or TV show out there. HOlYWOOD (NOT hollywod) needs to pay attention to shows like this, they could certainly use these peoples expertise in making a good movie!!!!!!"
4,Awesome Short,"Be forewarned, this is not a full-featured film. It is, however, 20 minutes worth of absolutely awesome futuristic action. Attention to detail is stellar. Feels like you're looking 10 or 20 years into the future and seeing what it might be like for an elite squad fighting out an individual mission. The film makers obviously tried hard to be as realistic as possible.Now they just need to do a full feature film. Please!"
5,Tips for Everything,"This book is full of how-to projects that will keep you busy. Everything from entertaining, to recipes, to organization, this book has it all."
4,great,i have had this for about 6 months now and i love it. the bass is realy good. i have realy enjoyed this system by rca
2,RCA Seems To Have Issues With CD Players,"I bought four of these with the idea that if one had problems, I'd be able to troubleshoot a little better. Well, one of the three hasn't even been used. Of the other three, only one hasn't had an issue. The other two have had skipping problems on CDs. With one, I was able to clean the laser (something I've never had to do on any other CD player I've owned) and it began working properly. The other one didn't respond to that. It simply skips over CDs like it doesn't see them.I've noticed other RCA models similar to this have been ripped for their CD players. I also wonder if some of the people posting positive reviews had problems later. I think I'll head to another brand next time."
5,The Best of Sinatra,"First, it is Frank Sinatra. Second, he is backed by Count Basie and his orchestra. It is simply the best that Frank has performed."
4,Sinatra at the Sands,"I gave this item four stars due to the condition of the case.I ordered it new and it came to me new but all the fingers that hold the cd were broke.As for the cd, perfect condition. The music? five stars, Great! Frank and Count are the swingingest, coolest cats ever. Nobody does it like this anymore."
5,Born in the wrong generation...,"I've always joked with people that, because of my taste in classic movies and music, I was born in the wrong generation. Frank Sinatra: Live at the Sands is one of the reasons I always say this. What entertainer today could muster such energy and emotion to transfix an audience? Singers today, and I use the word lightly, seem to focus to much on showing off there range instead of putting there own emotions into songs to sound original. Because of what Sinatra put into a song, the way he not only sang the lyrics but FELT them, he could never be copied or replaced. This concert at the Sands shows why he will always have one of the most individual, timeless voices that ever existed."
4,Sinatra in Paris is better,"I agree with a previous poster in that Sinatra's studio work is best. But, if you are planning on buying one, and only one Frank Sinatra live album, Sinatra & Sextet: Live in Paris is a much better album. I should know, I own both 'Paris' and 'Sands'. Paris is much tighter musically and Frank gives a better performance. I am not saying Sands is bad, and if you have a need for a live Sinatra performance backed up by a big band, then by all means get the Sands. But Live in Paris to me, is a better buy."
5,"Sinatra in top form, his finest recording","This is the Sinatra we all envision with respect and awe. When you get RID of those campy, silly and outright embarrassing awful Billy May arrangements, (not to mention May himself) and bring in Basie, then go to 1960's Vegas, you'll get the best on the mark performance Sinatra ever recorded. This material is about as swinging and hot as Sinatra gets. Period. On time, off time, no time, it ALL works here like magic: this is the epitome of cool swing arranging with a Basie band that is very much as hot as Sinatra in every way. The crowd loved it and you will too. If you buy NO OTHER Sinatra CD, you must buy this one."
5,That tone,"this album is a must. rich in elegance,texture&style. it's a thing of beauty to the ears. Frank,Count and a guy who would go on to be the greatest music producer in history Quincy Jones are all on this set. and it feels like class now how much of the garbage of today can say that? essential."
4,Vegas and Basie baby.,"This is Frank on his home turf; he rules it and you can hear it throughout the album. While I love the way he kicks with Basie, I miss the string section on some of the tunes."
4,'Frank' and 'Splank' Live!,"""Sinatra at the Sands"" (originally released in mid 1966) was actually the first commercial issue of a live Sinatra performance.The ""Sands"" album was recorded over a 10 day series of performances at the Sand's famous Copa Room and features Sinatra in his primed backed by the Basie band with most arrangements written by Quincy Jones.However, not all of Sinatra's material and arrangements are successfully ""Basie-ized""""It Was A Very Good Year"" and ""September of My Years,"" for example, still need the lush string arrangements of the original recordings; Billy May's chart on ""Luck Be A Lady"" with the tempo rushed seems awkward as performed here (""Luck"", by the way, was not released on the original LP), and even Frank and Basie can't save ""Get Me To The Church On Time"".But enough carping.""Sinatra At The Sands"" is Frank in the mid 60's, backed by the great Basie band, performing in Vegas before it was turned into a family-themed amusement park.What more need be said?"
5,"It's Boozin' Time, Baby!","It's hard to believe, but Sinatra sounds even better in this live performance than he does on his unbeatable recordings. The selections on this album are all magnificant, but my favorite is ""Fly Me to the Moon."" Sinatra swings like nobody else, he is in total control of the room, and his voice sounds like aged Jack Daniels and honey. PLEASE check this out, if you've ever wondered what this ""Chairman of the Board"" stuff is all about. At one point, Sinatra joyfully announces that it's time to wrap things up by exclaiming, ""It's boozin' time, baby!"" -- he'd like to keep singing, but he couldn't keep his bartender waiting. For all we baby boomers who will never see the man in concert, this CD makes you feel like you were there."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,"This movie isn't funny at all, the zombie stuff and action scenes are dull, and worst of all, there are parts in this movie that are just plain nasty. There are movies that are so bad they're good, and I've seen plenty, but this movie is just bad. Period. I was annoyed and disgusted when I finished this movie, and I'm sorry I ever wasted my time watching it."
4,Solid,"Solid progressive jazz album. There is no doubt that Charlie Hunter is a great palyer and with this album you deffinatly hear a range of influences from rock, blues and a dash of country. Charlie's work on ""Copperopolis"" shows how progressive he is by making a trio sound like a big band. The songs are long and very complex, which keep sit interesting all the way to the end. This album sets the stage for his next album ""Mistico"". Recommended tracks: Frontman, Blue Sock, Cueball Bobbin', Drop the rock."
3,Taking Relationships to the Next Level,"Most Relationship building books will tell WHY good relationships are important in business. 'The Ripple Effect: Maximizing the Power of Relationships for Life and Business, is the first to really tell you HOW to build the framework, the habits and the positive thinking that will allow you to master relationship building. Chapter 5, ""The ROI of Selflessness"" is a must read for all salespeople who want to take success to the next level.Mr. Harper is also the first since Norman Vincent Peale to not forget about Family and how important it is to nurture the relationships of those most important to us as well."
5,A Relationship Book for Everyone,"Finally - a book about Relationships for Mavens and Evangelists too! Most books on the subject are written by Relaters for other Relaters and the strategies and tactics they outline apply only to Relaters. Steve Harper takes a different tack. An incredible Relater himself, Steve provides unique strategies for Mavens and Evangelists by acknowledging their unique vantage point and bringing them into the game. I highly recommend Steve's wonderful book to everyone. Not only will you increase your awareness and ability to create and leverage relationships in your life, but you will do so in a sustainable way, long after you have read it!"
5,Required reading for all young professionals,The Ripple Effect is a must read primer for any young professional just launching a career and provides valid reminders for veterans alike. Steve's combination of personal experiences from early in his career combined with real life experiences of those he's met along the way reveals just how simple and how important it is to build a career and a life with meaningful relationships.
4,Personal improvement tool,"The Ripple Effect is based on the timeless principle as Benjamin Franklin stated, ""When you're good to others, your best to yourself."" Steve Harper motivates readers to think differently about their behavior and interpersonal relations in an effort to improve their results. He encourages the reader to focus on the long term perspective in networking in order to develop stronger relationships. It is a valuable tool for anyone interested in personal improvement.- Richard V. Battle - Author of, The Volunteer Handbook: How to Organize and Manage a Successful Organization and Surviving Grief by God's Grace."
5,A Better Alternative,"Is the business world a cutthroat, winner take all, show no emotion battleground, or is it a opportunity rich, win-win world full of positive relationships? Steve Harper believes in the power of positive, win-win business relationships and in his new book, The Ripple Effect, he explains why. If you read and enjoyed Tim Sander's Love is the Killer App, and you believe that the world in general and specifically the business world doesn't have to be a hyper-competitive, lonely place, then you will really enjoy Mr. Harper's book. The Ripple Effect is loaded with practical wisdom, personal anecdotes, and tips & techniques that you can put into practice immediately to make your life and the lives of those around you better. The best thing about this book is that it provides opportunity for exponential growth. And if its true that you get what you give, then this book is going to make the world a better and more interesting place, one person at a time."
4,The butterfly effect as it relates to everyday relationships...,"I've been networking now for several years and actually I was getting a little burned out. After reading this book, I can now visualize in my mind the effect that I have on not only the people I meet face-to-face, I actually have a positive impact (Ripple) on the world as a whole when I spread my own kindness, respect and time with those around me. Thanks for writing a great book that gave me focus and energy to continue creating positive ""ripples"" in the world around me!"
3,59 recipes for your dog,"I was actually looking for a Snoopy cookbook for people food when I got this. What it has is recipes to prepare meals (not just treats) for your dog.And what recipes! Creamed chipped beef, london broil, corn flakes and peaches? The intro says that they researched the nutritional needs of dogs, but these recipes seem to cater to indugent owners rather than the dogs themselves.But it was an entertaining read, fun to flip through, even if just to go ""whaaaat!?"" at the combos."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"Hussein tries to work in two different stories (the experiences of a Pakistani immigrant and the quickly maturing life of his independent-minded teenaged Desi daughter). Hussein uses the technique of having each speak their tale in alternating chapters. The result is a scarcity of story, detail and character in Parvin's, the daughter, lamentable tale of cultural and sexual frustration. This is a shame because, for me, her chapters were the most interesting. I was left wanting to know more about her life and experience in mid-60's Britain, a very fascinating time in general, and a very harsh and dangerous time there for Pakistanis in particular. These things he merely glosses over. The ending of the book was an extreme disappointment. Leaving me to say to myself, ""is this it?"""
5,The best 25 minute biographical film ever made,"I had the world DVD premiere for this film in February 2005 at the South Charleston Museum in South Charleston, WV. Hundreds showed up - and for good reason. It is the best selling film ever made inside West Virginia - about a West Virginian. It is also the best short documentary about an unusual man and his life ever made, making my Top Ten list of all times - in Facets Multimedia. The director, Jacob Young, watched films by Les Blank and Errol Morris, and using some of their style and his own, created a masterpiece. At one time the state library of West Virginia had at least 8 copies of this film, loaning all of them out for a decade or more. It is hilarious, sad, tragic, insightful - and about everything else one can show in a film. It stands with any film, including Errol Morris' masterpieces like THE FOG OF WAR."
4,Genuine Americana,"Now this is more like it! I first saw this documentary on VHS in a copy making the rounds with my friends in West Virginia.Just so you don't think that all of West Virginia, the good folks I know in northern West Virginia love this film and shrug while saying, ""Well, it is Boone County we're talking about...."" (My point is: no matter where you go, someone will find someplace else to goof on...unless it's Boone County).In lesser hands, this film could've been just a freak show slapped together, but I found it as earnest and sympathetic as it was outrageous and hilarious. I don't know if it's because my family originally came from the hills but I couldn't help but like Jesco (although the evil Jesco was spooky) and the Elvis personality (might be a regional thing when it comes to Elvis).An essential addition to Appalachian culture. And funny too."
5,Hard to Describe,"I had a copy I purchased from West Virginia Public Television after being shown the documentary by a friend's dad.Needless to say, a mere plot summary does not encompass the jaw-droppingly hilarious and sad details of Jesco White's existance. But, basically, it is the story of Jesco White and his endeavours to take the skills as a mountain dancer his father passed on to him and the roadblocks placed by family and life. It is also a very interesting sociological document on how the other half lives.The outtakes are quite interesting.Dancing Outlaw II is just plain stupid. The unfortunate thing about this show is the players are self-aware. So instead of verité, you get these people doing bits. This show is about Jesco's debut on Roseanne. Don't even bother.Heads up, order the DVD on [...] as it is far less expensive."
2,Not worth the $24.95 I paid to own it.,"It wasn't what I expected and for $24.95 I could've got two other mothers that were longer and better. It ends dumb and it's more like a documentary. If they redid it as a movie it ""might"" be worth it."
5,Interesting.,An interesting view into a different culture. This is eye opening.The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia is also interesting.
4,Interesting character with unique talent.,"The director just went there and recorded daily life, which is far removed from most folks lifestyle, but very interesting, independent in life choices anyway, people."
4,Classic Jesco,If you are a Jesco White fan and want to see the beginning this is a great movie to watch. I enjoyed the whole thing and it's a great prequel to The Wild and Wonderful Whites.
4,Jessico,"Interesting documentary. If you like the Whites, this is a must see. Some of us do not realize how hard some folks have it in our country."
5,Dancing Outlaw,"great video. a must see. I would recommend watching this video, as well as the follow up documentary from 2010 ""The Wild Wonderful Whites of West Virginia"""
1,A boring book,I needed it for an Ed class. It wasn't very useful at all. Can't believe someone spent money writing & publishing it!!
1,Worst Teacher Education Text I Have Read,"This book is nothing but George Lucas' personal tribute to the technology that made him a superstar. This book is filled with rhetoric, unsubstantiated claims and lots of full-color pictures. It does not have any use for someone in a teacher education program, as it reads more like a coffee table book. The included CD-ROM is the icing on the huge cake of b.s., and goes to show, once again, that if you are rich and famous, you can publish anything."
1,Not the MHC I know,Ms. Higgins Clark seems to be resting on her own laurels after so many books. This one is pretty much predictable and ordinary. Certainly nowhere near her best. I would skip it and donate that money to an animal sanctuary .
1,Clunky bore!,Boring. Clunky. Obvious. Tiresome. Laboured writing. Hated the way she spelled out the thoughts of each character like a bad melodrama. I couldn't wait for it to be over. What a waste of time!
1,Not worth the time,Now I know why I had not read a book from MHC since my 20s : they are childishly written. The end seems to have been written in a hurry and is worse than the beginning. I can't find any more to say than this about the book. Very weak story.
3,Very Blue Reading,"I had stopped reading MHC for over two years now and when a co-worker gave me this book to read, I figured I'd give her another shot. No good. As others have stated before me, the story was dull and the ending, anti-climatic. Two three-year old twin girls get kidnapped; one is brought back and the rest of the story hunts the lost twin down. Nothing exciting. The bad guy was no surprise and frankly, who cared at that point. The whole ""twin-talk"" thing really turned me off and yes, they did seem quite advanced for three-year olds. Well maybe in another two years I'll give MHC another try. For now, I am sticking with authors who write books with substance."
1,Boring and tedious,"At best, this book could be compared to a low-budget TV movie. The book was boring and tedious. By the middle of the book I stopped reading the book and only skimmed it. Obviously this book was going to be a happy ending to Clark's not too thrilling book. This book might be considered to be a beach read but only if you're desperate."
3,Author's writing style took away from the suspense...,"This was my first venture into the world of Mary Higgins Clark. Would I read another of her books? Possibly. I liked this book because it was a fast read (it took me less than two days), and most of the time, the suspense did keep me interested. The problem I had with it was that the author started right off with the kidnapping of the twins, and then throughout the rest of the book kept interjecting the suspense with somewhat annoying descriptions of new characters. I seriously think she must have described, in detail, a hundred people in this book. I suppose I'm just a fan of the idea of describing your characters first and then immersing your readers in the suspense of the story, that way it isn't constantly broken up with paragraphs about tall, muscular blonde men with icy gray eyes, and old women with salt-and-pepper hair who make homemade vegetable soup."
4,Worth reading,"First book I have read by MH Clark. I found it to be fast reading, keeping my interest all through the book. I was guessing all the way through who the real ""Pied Pipper"" was."
3,"No ""wow"" factor","I'm a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark's earlier novels. However in this novel, characters had little development. The dialogue was stilted and unsophisticated. The chapters were too short. Having the kidnappers jump back and forth between their real names was distracting. It was great to have other characters as possible suspects but trying to keep track of their related stories was annoying. Dropping the names of some real places and making up others was disconcerting as well. The narrative lacked for details as well. I wanted to know why this couple? Why these kids? I empathized with the predicament of the two little girls, Kathy and Kelly. However the surrounding adult characters and plot were lacking in details and cogent dialogue to get me truly excited about this novel."
1,a waste of time,"I have been a fan of Mary Higgins Clark for more years than I would like to admit. This was the worst book I have ever read by her and I was completely disappointed. The only word I could use to describe it is boring, boring, boring. I couldn't even finish it."
3,Good Plot But Flawed Delivery,"MHC's latest is a throwback to her beginnings, the kidnapping of kids, in this case twins. But the ""Twin-Talk"" thing is overblown, so much so it's not credible. I'm married to a twin, so I've seen first-hand the amazing thought-pattern and emotion-sharing between them, and yes, even some physical pain, although that part is usually sympathy related. But the level of twin sharing portrayed in this book goes way too far, into the Twilight Zone. Still, this is an engaging story, despite the many flaws in its delivery. Flaws? Incredibility to be sure. But beyond that, I don't think MHC has ever turned down an adverb. And her characters engage in ""thought conversations"" that aren't realistic.I thought MHC might be losing her plotting edge, that she was falling into formulaic writing. I was glad to see her break from the plot formula of the last few books and go back to her roots. If I had it to do over again, I might not buy this book, but at least this one I finished."
3,"Not MHC's best, not her worst","Intriguing plot (telepathic twins kidnapped) as per the usual MHC fare. But the only thing that consistently bugged me was the language ascribed to the three year old twins. They spoke in complete, complex language which is extremely unusual for that age. It kept jarring me during what would have been an otherwise engaging read. I also figured out the identity of the Pied Piper much sooner than I'd expected (or hoped) which made me less eager to get through the book. I've read much better by her, so I was somewhat disappointed. This book isn't a keeper in my personal library, but it wasn't a waste of time, either."
3,"Intriguing story, but too easy","This was the first Mary Higgins Clark book that I read, it was picked to read in my book club. I read this book very quickly and my interest was peaked for the entire book but I felt this book was a too simple. I felt it was way easy to figure out who did what and why because it was written in such an elementary way. I'm not sure if all of her books are written this way or not. Regardless, I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense and mysteries; it was fun and very fast to read. Everyone in my book club liked it as well, although the subject matter left all of the mothers uneasy and uncomfortable but still they enjoyed this book. Not a must-read, but fun just the same."
2,Big sleeper,I waited months for another thrilling suspenseful filled Mary Higgins Clark book and all I got was pure dispointment. Glad she came out with another book so shortly
1,HUH?,"My niece's stories are comparable to what I just read, but she's only 10!! The JEWELS so ostentatiously displayed by the author PROVE once again it doesn't take talent or brains to become rich...just a good agent!!!!!!!! At best, I might recommend this to a high school reader!!!"
2,Ouch,"I bought this and ""The Call Girl Actress, Confessions of a Lesbian Escort"" by Erica Black. I raced through Erica's book, I never finished Clarks. Hmmm."
4,Two Little Girls In Blue,The book was off to a quick start and the tempo kept up until the end. There were surprises and interesting theories to think about. I really enjoyed this book.
1,My first and last,The characters in this book are shallow and undeveloped. I kept waiting for the characters to be developed or to catch my interest. Never happened. Ms. Clark introduces character after character to keep the story moving but never fully explains their personalities. What a boring read! I predicted the plot long before there really was one. I bought into the buzz about this novel and now wish I hadn't bought the book or the buzz. What a disappointment!
1,Longing for the past,I also was a fan of Ms. Clark early on. Have been very disappointed in her latest efforts...but still keep hoping. Too bad for me...I think the main thing that dissappoints is the 'level' of the writing. I am not 10 years old!
5,A Real Page-Turner,"I used to be an avid Nicholas Sparks fan. His last few novels, however, have been very drab. So, I went looking for something on the ""New Fiction"" shelf of my library. And found ""Two Little Girls In Blue"". It's my first mystery and what a way to introduce someone to the genre!From the very first page, you can get the eery feeling of what is to come. This book was an easy read and ran smoothly, with no excessive babbling on. Every 2-3 pages, a new chapter would begin. This was a wonderful bonus for me because when I put down a book to do something else, I like to end the chapter first. No ""wait 30 minutes to finish the chapter"" with this book..This was the first book in YEARS that I had to keep reading, I couldn't put it down. Literally! I would often quickly finish my daily chores just to hurry up and get back to the book!I suggest everyone go read it."
2,Very dissapointing!,"This book was a huge disappointment. The plot was promising, the subject matter of twins communicating telepathically was unique and potentially interesting.I instead got a story about a bunch of FBI hacks chasing kidnappers through New York and Cape Cod. The story had a dizzying array of characters, gaping holes, and no character development whatsoever.It is a shame that someone with a name like Mary Higgins Clark can pen her name to such rubbish and have it be an instant blockbuster, while there are so many truly gifted writers out there going virtually unnoticed by the masses."
3,Not MHC's best work,"Having read several other MHC books prior to this, I can't say that I was impressed by this one. The plot is cute, but the twin thing was played too much and came across as rather cheesy. Also, I was surprised to see who the bad guy was in her other books, it was always the person I least expected. However, with this one, I was able to guess who was responsible for the kidnapping. If you're new to MHC, do NOT get this book. There's plenty of other books she wrote that were enjoyable."
3,Disappointing effort from an excellent author,"I always look forward to a new Mary Higgins Clark. The last few, including this one, have been disappointing. ""Two Little Girls in Blue"" just doesn't have the gripping tension and suspense that her earlier books had. I had no trouble putting this down.I'm sure I'll buy her next book anyway, but I hope it's better than ""Two Little Girls in Blue."""
2,Boring,I never finished reading this book. I found that I didn't care what happened (although any one could see how it would end). I don't even care who the Pied Piper was. Too many books out there to waste time.
3,Pretty good read,This was a fairly good read. The story line about the communication between twins was interesting. Overall I enjoyed the book.
2,Two Little Girls in Blue,"This is the first book by Mary Higgins Clark that has not ""grabbed"" me and kept me reading as soon as I could find any spare time. She's a great author, but this one is below average."
3,"Good, But Seems More Like James Patterson","Have been a fan of Mary Higgins Clark for more than 20 years. I really liked her earlier books, where average people were caught in a web of circumstances beyond their control. But lately she seems to be resorting to James Patterson-type sickos who give themselves weird names. She's still a great suspense writer, and her books are still like a bag of potato chips... you can't stop until you are finished. I recommend this book for a fast read with some good twists and turns...I just wish she'd go back to more believable plots (like THE CRADLE WILL FALL). If you are into books with plots that revolve around twins (as this one does), then Rosamond Smith's (aka Joyce Carol Oates') books are worth looking for (DOUBLE DELIGHT, LIVES OF THE TWINS, etc.). If you like more lighthearted suspense, with likable characters, no sickos, and villains who get their just desserts, try Steven Rigolosi's WHO GETS THE APARTMENT?"
4,Arrived as promised,This is a text book for me and I've not yet read it. But it arrived as promised in good condition.
5,Very nice reader,"My pre-schooler was enchanted by the whole story and I find her retelling the story over and over again to her friends. It is a book always in her hands for me to read one more time.My first grader is hesitant to read and not into horses, so she wouldn't have picked the book off the shelf. But when her little sister brought it home, she discovered that the book was very approachable. The writing was simple, the font was laid out with lots of white space and the illustrations were engaging. So with a litle bit of encouragement, she did read it herself and found that Little Rat was a pretty interesting character.As a mom, I found Little Rat's story of trying something new to be positive and upbeat. The ""lesson"" was gently told and with humor--in a way that doesn't insult the reader. We got it out of the library first, but it was the kind of book you'd want in your child's library, so we ordered a copy of our own."
3,I am returning this DVD,"I purchased the SONY DVP-S530D on 10/23/99. The first movie I watched was the MATRIX. Awesome movie. It looked great and sound great on my stereo. But then I watched the ""Making of the Matrix"" segment and halfway through Keanu Reeves mouth was moving but his voice did not match up with the video. After reading other lip-sync stories on Amazon, I am returning this lemon and buying a Toshiba."
2,"Amazon, please leverage some pressure on Sony","Would prefer no stars--I haven't bought yet. I have been monitoring these comments for two months, but am waiting for this lip-synch concern to be resolved. Whoever monitors this site from Amazon, can you please leverage some pressure on Sony to respond definitively on this? Will they have a reliable, working unit out by Christmas? What is Amazon's position on selling stock subject to this flaw? How will we know when this is resolved? Thanks."
5,"Great DVD player, with one quirk",A great DVD player. I've seen the lip sync problem intermittently and only briefly on a few DVDs. The one criticism I have of the 530 is that it doesn't play (audio) CD-Rs.
2,Defective Product,OK this particular model is defective and there is a pending class action suit against Sony. It can rarely get through a DVD without having some sort of audio or video problem. I would not reccomend this player to anyone.
3,Pretty good,"I had a problem with mine under a year after purchase. It was a problem with the power unit. Luckily I was still under warranty and got it fixed. It's worked great ever since.The only 2 issues i have are the lack of CD-R support, and sometimes i notice a slight audio sync problem, it seems to appear and disappear at random."
3,SONY DVP-S530D,Great dvd player. Two years and running strong. One drawback though; it won't read recorded music cd from cd burner.
4,"Experienced lip-synch issues, but Have other fix.","I began experiencing the lip-synch issues as well after watching just a couple of DVD's. Stopping it and restarting has helped, but then I adjusted the audio setup on the player(I run it solely through my surround sound reciever). Since then I've watched at least a half-dozen movies and have yet to experience the problem again. If it recurs , I will be sure to send it back. Now that the sound problem has gone away, this component is the crown-jewel of my home theater! I am quite pleased with the sound and picture quality... and absoultely in love with the format."
1,Not again,"Mine is a just over a year old. Guess what? Yep, it's croaking. In fact, every Sony product I bought the past decade -- a phone, 2 portable CD players, a TV, and now this -- failed just after the warranty expired. I've finally learned my lesson."
3,"It is a decent DVD player, but I wish I could get my $ back.","The picture and sound are usually great, but every now and then I get an annoying green or purple light at the top of the screen. Also, when it is a letterbox movie, the top black section gets a shaky white fuzz. Maybe it is just my lasers or something? What do you think. I'm going to take it back to where I got it and get them to fix it."
1,Sony's Fall From Grace...,"Whatever you do, do NOT buy a Sony DVD. You are asking for trouble, and aggravation. First, there were the horror stories from the S560D owners. I'd bet money that every one of those failed eventually.Now, Sony launches another piece of dung, the S530D. Did this company change ownership or what?? When I spend several hundred dollars on an item, I expect it to last more than 1.5 years! Plus, I got absolutely nowhere with Sony Tech Support/ Customer Service. They tried to tell me I dirtied the lens with dirty/dusty DVD's. Funny, I've not heard of such a problem with owners of other MFR's equipment.Well, I have a rack full of Sony electronics, and I hereby swear I will NEVER replace any one of them with a Sony product.Do not buy Sony, or you will be like me, writing a nasty Sony review, VERY soon!"
4,99% Happy,"What can I say that has not allready been said. The DVP-S530D is a great player. That is why I bought it in the first place. I would have given the player 5 stars if not for having to send it in because of the lip-sync problem. But hey, I got it back 5 days after I sent it in and it works great. I am glad I bought this DVD player and would recomend it to anyone looking for a player in this price range. By the way, it looks great with my WEGA tv. Buy it, watch it, if you get the lip-sync send it in on Monday....watch movies of Friday. Don't let the hype get ya."
3,Excellent except for lip-sych bug,"This is in all respects a top of the line DVD player, except for the intermittent lose of lip-synch. This happens on my machine about once a week. You stop and restart (the 530 starts where it was stopped unless you hit stop twice) and the problem goes away.After denying the problem, Sony has emailed some owners that they are looking into the problem. Go to deja.com and search rec.video.dvd for ""530"" to see more details on the problem.Again, this is a nearly perfect DVD in all respects but this one."
1,audio lag problem is awful,"Granted the picture is excellent, but having the voice be out of synch with the lips moving is ridiculous. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to get something fixed by Sony? And think of how few people will have the diligence to pester Sony long enough to get it corected? My advice: buy a machine that works properly from the start and stay away from this known defective unit."
5,One of the Best DVD Players by SONY,"This is a great machine all around. What puts this ahead of other units is that you can pull up the DVD menu not only from the remote but also on the front of the unit. It even has a Jog-shuttle dial on the unit for Still, Pause and Frame advance which is very smooth. This unit even has a built-in 5.1 Dolby Digital Decoder for 5.1 Upgradable Receivers. You get a choice of Composite, S or Component video outputs. The remote works on all SONY TVs. Very, very good for the money."
1,Most of these units break after 12-18 months,"I was a happy S530D owner until a month ago when I began getting the dreaded ""C13 00"" error. It would not recognize any DVD I put in; even brand new ones.I did a web search and was amazed to find that many, many people who have bought this player (and Sony players in general) have had exactly the same problem after a year to a year and half.Sony refuses to do a recall and I've since bought a new player (not a Sony; I settled on a JVC XV-FA90), but I thought I should post my experience here. Buyer beware on this player; it has a very high rate of terminal failure."
4,great price and quality,"I purchased this dvd player and for the money it is well worth it. Though I have experienced the lip sync problem only once (during ""Saving Private Ryan--Special Edition""), the picture and sound quality makes up for the few gliches the system has."
5,awesome entry level DVD player!,"If you have a small TV (27"" or smaller) then don't bother spending more on a DVD player. This player is loaded with features that were not normally found on the older players, like on board Dolby Digital decoding and DTS. Plus, you get component video out and a S-video connection (plugs right into recent model Sony TVs). It works well, and the remote has easy access to ""subtitle"" and ""angle"" changes. If you have a low end receiver like mine, which only supports Dolby Surround, the S530D will downmix the audio to provide the best sound."
5,Picture quality and sound of the Sony DVSP530D blows me away,"Before deciding to purchase my first DVD, I did lots of homework. I checked out the Panasonic and Toshiba lines and looked around on and off-line. Having reached the point of having to make a decision, I checked out this area for other consumer comments. It was interesting to see that although there is lots said about the audio sync problem in this model, the clear majority of those who purchased it gave it a five star rating. Well, I am here to say that I can understand why! I purchased the 530D recently and experienced the audio sync situation once already. But, I realized that because of all the talk about it, I was looking for it and it turned out not to be as noticeable as I expected and it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the film I was viewing. In fact, all of the pluses way out-weighed this little 'glitch'. Picture, color, sound, and all other features are extraordinary. I believe I made the right choice."
2,"Sony DVDs can't play ""burned"" Audio CDs","I bought a Sony DVD player. It played DVDs OK, but it couldn't play audio CD's I created from my PC. I returned this machine and I bought a Pioneer DVD player instead. These CDs play fine on this machine. In fact, these CDs work on my car CD players, my computer CD players, and my 10-year old Yamaha CD player. I was surprised that a new Sony DVD machine can't handle this, since all of these other machines could. Maybe future versions will correct this oversight."
5,Still kicking!,"We bought this DVD player when it first came out and continue to abuse it with weekend DVD marathons and such. It hasn't left its spot in the entertainment center since the day we bought it as there has been no need for maintenance or repair. It provides a lot of options but isn't overly complicated to operate. In my 25 years of experience with Sony products, they have consistently been outstanding in quality, durability, and reliability."
3,Incomplete Pictures of Rebbe Nachman,"And many of Rebbe Nachman's sayings are inspirational. But the reader should know that this short book only contains part of the story. Rebbe Nachman is a complex thinker. He often says multiple, often contractor things about a subject. And for every hopeful and joyful utterance, there is probably a negative one as well.There are many things about Rebbe Nachman that modern, secular people would find objectionable. His attitude about masturbation in his book Rabbi Nachman's Tikkun is unfortunate and medieval. Of course, none of that is in this volume. We are meant to feel good here, and not guilty."
3,Did you check the customer images?,"Did either of the one-star reviewers take a look at the ""customer images"" of Peter Nero's ""Summer Of 42"" CD, which, if enlarged, clearly shows the track listing that they were complaining wasn't there? As the saying goes, ""It doesn't take a rocket scientist..."""
4,Johnny Cash reads the Bible,The DVD was well done and with the Bible verses on the screen it is easy to follow while Johnny reads. It would be enjoyable to anyone who wants to hear the Bible read.Donna from Kansas
4,very compact,I really like this set up for how inconspicuous it is. The speakers sound solid. The only problem with mine is the cd player spindle is out of alignment and some cd's will actually scrape against the player's plastic chassis as they play.
1,"Phillips ""borrows"" writing from his grad students?","Phillips was a professor of mine in grad school. Years later, imagine my surprise to find one of my papers...lifted word for word...in his book. I would have hoped Mr. Phillips would have taken the time to write his own content. Indeed, I wonder how much other material in his book was ""borrowed"" from his students and how much is actually original thought."
2,garnet three stone earrings sterling silver,"very disappointed in these they look so much bigger in image presented. o.k. they are wearable, but I thought They would be larger"
2,The same old story told the same old way,"I don't expect anyone to ever really rival Tolkien, but I do wish that McKiernan could have been a little bit more creative in his efforts. Tip and Beau are such dull characters--almost as if they'd been cut out of a generic book. Tip's nsudden love interest, Beau's constant ""Oh My"" just gets more grating as the story goes on. I'm afraid this is another forgettable fantasy novel. What happened to the good old days of Shannara, Jennifer Roberson and Raymond Feist? Even the Iron Tower Trilogy seemed to have elements of deep thought rather than simple rehashing. DM can do better."
1,TWO PANZIES GO ON JOURNEY,"Actually, this book caught my interest in the beginning, but it went downhill from there. The book is written in one continuous stream, therefore, not a complicated plot. The two main characters are so wimpy that I couldn't get too involved with them. They feel an urgent need to deliver a coin, yet wimp out and hang around an elf town for several months waiting for spring because winter soooo cold - ooooo(oh my!). Their big conflict is who should carry the coin(such sacrifice - oh my!). Then the two idiots spend several chapters just asking dumb questions(a cheap and 'beginners' way of telling the story and informing the reader of details - oh my!). Actually, this book has some value. You can see how NOT to write a novel. By all means, go ahead and buy this book. You have to read bad books to appreciate good books. Buy it now(oh my!)"
2,Not very good,"This is the story of two hobbits, I mean warrows, who set off on a journey to deliver a ring, I mean coin, that may help save the world from the evil mage Sauron, I mean Modru. Along the way they are aided by elves, dwarves, and sorcerers, and threatened by various magical monsters, not to mention clumsy prose.McKiernan has an ugly habit of switching between a sort of bastardized faux-Middle English and normal modern English, as well as stealing all his plot ideas from Tolkien. The charcters are pretty good and their adventures at times exciting, but there just isn't enough here to recommend."
1,Lamer than a two legged horse,"This book is a veiled rip-off of Tolkien. The plot is week and character development is non existent. The two main characters go a mission for no good reason. Oh Wait, we have to save the world! Please, that is so old. They travel through a dangerous forest (hint MIRKWOOD) and get nothing but a scratch. The only wepons they carried was a bow for a 3 foot tall guy. HELLO! Reality, are you there! Take your girl out or better yet, re-read Tolkien. You will be glad you did."
4,The journey into this fantasy is awesome.,Mithgar is an incredible place to wander off in. I love the twists and unforseen events. I only can hope that Mr. McKiernan continues writing about this wonderful place. I have enjoyed every tale.
1,Want my copy?,"Let's see -- slow, derivitive, unengaging characters. The authors who let themselves be quoted on the cover (Jennifer Robeson?) should be ashamed of themselves. I'll stay away from this author in the future."
4,Wonderfull Book,"This book is an absolute must read for any Mc kiernan fan, ever since I read the Iron Towers trilogy I've been hooked on Mythgar, and for all those that think that McKiernan is coppying the hobbit, obviously youve never read the hobbit, bilbo baggins is a barefoot thief that goes on adventures with a bunch of dwarves, I dont see the conection, anyway this is a great book, ive read it twice already."
2,He dragged the story to fill the pages...,"I enjoyed the first book and overlooked as he started to add silly characters (moving stones, one swamp giant lizard, the elf ritual) it was not a tight, focused story. Alot like Eddings.. lets get some characters and have them travel... and wander.. and battle... then rest... then over to more travel.. introduce walking rocks... It seemed to me between the 2 books he had one long book or a book and 1/2 to make it good."
2,"Tolkien Revisited, but the Lite Version","Beau and Tipperton are Wallows. Little people. Not quite pixies, but closer to the Tolkien story. Tip is going to deliver a coin to Agron somewhere over the mountain, after the coin drops in his lap when a soldier drops dead on his doorstep.Why is he doing this? Well, someone has to. Why is Beau along for the ride? Well, it seems like a good idea.Then there are the problems with adults in small bodies acting like kids. The author forgets that Tip has run a mill for four years and Beau has served an appreniceship to be a healer. Why are they so immature?"
2,gloryland,I really was disappointed in the songs. I was looking for something like the Gaithers music.Got what i ordered. Service was fast and I like the no hassel ordering process.
5,Great Bluegrass Gospel,"This album came up as I was searching for a Bluegrass Gospel. After sampling several choices, this kept coming up as number 1 with a variety of songs and performers. It is a great album to keep in my vehicle and play when regular radio offers nothing worthwhile--and that is often. My husband enjoys it too! Clarity is good."
2,Review of Glorylandv,the songs were older and opf poor quality recording not what i expected and let me down so i dont paly it anymore after the first try
5,soft sided toy organizer,"I love this product. It is nice and sturdy, yet it is soft so my baby won't get hurt bumping into it or falling on it. It also looks attractive in her room compared to the plastic toy boxes. She loves keeping her toys in it and exploring all its features (it has a lot). Great value for the money!"
4,answering about dimensions...,"In response to the poster who asked about the dimensions, it's 24"" wide x 15"" high x 15"" deep (per description on the front of the box). The carry tote that fits inside is maybe 1/3 the size of that...I just received this yesterday from my registry, and I had picked it out online, so I was quite pleased at the size. As other reviewers have mentioned, it is quite smelly when you first take it out of the box, so it's ""airing out"" in our family room right now... I don't expect that it will continue to be a problem once it has gotten exposed to air circulation...I am giving it 4 stars for now just because of the smell... in case I have to clean it to get rid of the smell. Otherwise, looks like it would be 5 stars (although, as I said, I haven't used it yet)."
4,wonderful toy organizer,"This toy chest is colorful, cheery, and baby friendly. my 9 months old son loves to play on the activity mat and pull the sun mirror off from it. i love the way the tote comes out and you can dump all the toys on the floor for him to play. afterwards just put everything back and slide it back in its compartment, and the activity mat folds right up and leaves everything neat and clean. However, it DOES smell! when the lid opens/closes, the odor comes out from within. I think it is the material that this chest is made from. I left the top open to air it out, after awhile the smell gets less. But leaving it covered overnight collects the smell again. I love it enough that the smell doesn't bother me as much, but I wouldn't think stick your head in there after it's been closed for awhile is a good idea. it would be rated a 5 if it's not for the smell."
1,Horrible chemical odor from Foam,I wish I hadn't ordered this online -- too much of a hassle to send back -- however the chemical smell is so strong after airing it out for two weeks that I don't want to put my baby's toys in it.
2,Strong chemical smell,I'm not sure about this item. It has a strong odor and is very flimsy. I like that it is soft...but it may be too soft. Will have to see what our son thinks of it. At this point I would not recommend this product.
4,Decent soft sided toy box,"I wanted a soft sided toy box for my infant son's toys and this was the least expensive choice. It's not exactly my style (bright blue!) and doesn't fit in with my decor, but it's very obvious that it's for toys and it works just fine for that purpose. It assembles in seconds and the compartments are handy for separating big toys from little toys that my son chews on."
4,A bit small,"I put this item on my baby registry and my husband bought it as a gift for my son, before he was born! I like that it is soft sided, easy to clean and has bright bold colors/designs to stimulate little minds. I did not notice the smell. The only problem I found is that it was a bit small, we put all our stuff toys inside and other small toys and it was not big enough. I guess it can be the right size for some people if you don't want a huge toy box standing out in your living room. I still use it, but had to put all the other toys in another box. Also, after you stuff everything inside, it sort of loses it's shape after awhile. We never took the removeable tote out, the separate compartment is nice for smaller toys, but somehow, things don't end up where they need to be if you have other kids in the house. Overall, it is sturdy and worth getting."
2,Large and cute but horrible smell!!!!!!!!,I read the reviews about the smell but since most of the reviews were positive I hoped that was an old (solved) problem. The chest arrive and was spacious and cute. My tot liked opening the lid and would not get hurt running into it. But the smell was noxious! It smells like just produced toxic plastic. I aired it out for 2 weeks (!) in another room. Then taking drastic measures (realizing that it ruins the chance of return but hoping to keep this oh so cute box) i dunked it into a cold bath. After it dried (which it did without any problems btw) it still smelled. So did the toys left in it overnight. Sadly the chest went to the curb...
5,Sassy Soft Sided Toy Box Works Well,My son is almost 1 and we had toys all over the living room until I purchased this toy box/organizer. We now have a neater living room and it is easy for my son to get toys out on his own. The removable tote that comes in the inside was great to carry his toys in when we recently drove to Florida. I am sure he will enjoy the little town that folds down on the front when he is a bit older. The best thing about this product is it much safer than a traditional wooden toy box.
4,Great Product!,"We bought this toy box for our toddler twins, and I love the fact that they can play with it, and I don't have to worry about one of them shutting a hard lid on the other's head...or little fingers getting pinched. They are still learning the concept of putting toys away after they're done playing with them...but now that they have a fun place to put them...it's making that task easier. The only reason it didn't receive five stars...there is no fastener for the lid. (I thought that there would be a velcro flap, or some type of closure).Love the concept, design and it's working out perfectly for us!"
2,Soft but NOT sturdy,"This was great for my son when he was just learning to walk, but as soon as he learned to crawl in it.. forget it! He would pull himself up on it and he top feel in and the side pushed out. I'm searching for a new wooden one!"
4,Demon Z,"Love playing this guitar, puts a smile on my face when I do. I play mostly metal, I would say this is not made for metal but with the distortion factory petal it's sounds pretty awesome. The Dean Vendetta, which I also have, sounds much better and has more of the metal sound without the cool look. Bought this when it was on sale for $130, would buy again for same price."
5,Gary U. S. Bonds Best of,"Why 5 stars because its great no bs songs on this cd just the hits plus a few extras the way I remember them, this is a good cd for people who like the early 60's."
3,the end of r'n'r ?,"Time travel in the early sixties with these titles from 1960 up to 1966 (and one unreleased). Very lively and full of joy with Bonds' teenager singing. The hit ""New Orleans"" is still heavy. Yet, these twistin' songs display the ending of the golden epoch of rock'n'roll."
4,So What Else is New?,"I accepted from the start that Gary US Bonds' tunes had crappy sound quality. I never expected more, so I was not disappointed with this package of his hits (and other songs). It's all music history to me and I recommend it for that reason. But now I get to deduct a star for that crappy sound."
3,Its missing the two best I think,"This Little Girl Is Mine...I Am Outta Work....Lordy, those were two of his best!!cheersDavid"
3,Not their 6th album-- it's mid level Weather Report at best,"This is not Weather Report's 6th album. It is their 12th album (counting the Live in Tokyo album which is generally not available in the U.S.) Also, the track listings in the Amazon review section are for Weather Report's 1st album from 1971, also entitled simply ""Weather Report"" but which is a very different sounding album. This 12th album is from 1982. It is the weakest recorded effort of the Jaco Pastorius group and was somewhat of a disappointment at the time, as Weather Report fans expected great compositions, great playing, and a sense of magic from the group's albums, and this was more of a good, solid, somewhat routine product. It is pleasant enough but certainly in the bottom tier of Weather Report's albums. Since there is nothing so good today in electric jazz, it sounds better today than when it came out."
2,Running out of steam,"Weather Report released two self-titled albums in their career -- their 1971 debut, and this 1982 album. The latter is the last recording of the most popular Weather Report lineup -- Zawinul, Shorter, Pastorius and Erskine. Much like its predecessor, Night Passage, this one sounds like a very competent, professional band that's out of fresh ideas and rehashes old ones. There are the same tight, third-world grooves with layered synthesizers and floating saxophone, but you've heard it all before and the tunes aren't especially memorable. (""Volcano for Hire"" is pretty cool nonetheless.) It's safe to skip this one unless you're a completist or raging Night Passage fan; and even if you are, you should probably jump ahead to 1983's superior Procession."
1,Taste horrible.,"The pomegranate flavor is great, this flavor is awful. Amazon doesn't ship the pomegranate to my address so I ordered this flavor. Next time I'll just buy from somewhere other than Amazon."
5,Review Music,This was a great purchase of a wonderful piece of classic music. The music was a gift to a friend who is an avid music lover. He loved the gift.
5,great,"the interaction and the product was great, quick delivery would use them again and I have recommended them to my friends.thanks"
5,Amazing Album!,I bought this album and was blown away! Laura Nyro and Labelle sound great together. Laura Nyro was so underrated and should have recieved more kudos.
5,Yum,"I have very few CD's that I can listen from the first to final track in one sitting without skipping over at least one or two. This is one of them. Find an imperfection! It is impossible. Laura captures a place and time that left us before I was born yet when I close my eyes and listen to her and LaBelle I am transported to New York, down those steps, and into the echoes of the train station where she would sing with harmony groups. I think she knew too much about music and that was why she wasn't as popular as she should have been. She knew too well how to make the songs a deep expression of her soul and that disturbed people. We lost her too darn soon."
5,I am very picky....,"And even if I really liked an album I would normally only give it 4 stars cause usually there are a coupla lousy songs. My tastes in music are broad, from Bach to Pink, so if you like music that you will cherish for years, get this album. Although there is genius in other Laura Nyro albums I sorta wish she had Patti Labelle in the studio when she made them. Some (including me) might find it hard to get past the rambling tempos and jarring dynamic changes of her other work (sorta like some of Beethovens' pieces). Gonna take a miracle will satisfy the soul of both novice and die-hard Nyro fanatic alike. We are talking perfection and grace."
5,Pocket Streets great help to Fire/EMS personnel!,"We use Microsoft Pocket Streets 2005 in our duties as fire & EMS workers.Although we know our districts pretty well, due to recent growth and expansion resulting in more and more streets to keep up with, it's nice to have Pocket Streets on our pocket PC's so we can quickly look up an address. Pocket Streets works great on my Ipaq."
1,DON'T BUY! WASTE OF MONEY!,"This is a complete joke. The only cities that are in the program for U.S. states are major metro areas. If you have a handheld (either regular or mobile phone) you more than likely also have WiFi or GPRS internet connection. And if you are in a major metro area, with a WiFi connection, why would you need a program for maps? Just go to Yahoo Maps or Mapquest. If you don't have a WiFi, then just buy a paper map...it will do the same thing (maybe even more!) than this program.The only possible way this program could be useful is if you already have a handheld GPS receiver AND you never find yourself outside major metropolitan cities. I have a GPS receiver for my laptop (USB) which I though could connect to my handheld and it won't...so my advice is to buy an entire package (software and handheld-specific GPS receiver).Can't believe Microsoft put its name on this junk."
1,Poor selection of maps,"I purchased this program recently, and was very disappointed. The maps are very limited...for example, most of the major tourist areas (beaches, Newport, ect.) in Rhode Island are cut out of the RI map. I recommend buying MS Streets and Trips 2005 (which includes Pocket Streets 2005 in the box) instead:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002DOEAM/qid=1121691049/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-6971135-7476654?v=glance&s;=pc&n;=507846With this program, you have the entire USA at your disposal, and you can select which maps to send to your pocket pc or smartphone.Fortunatly, the store that sold me Pocket Streets allowed me to exchange it for Streets and Trips (after paying the difference). The prices are very close."
2,Not the PDA software you need.,"There is no search or travel direction capability. You have to download every states and need to know what ""county"" the address you are looking for(like in CA, you have LA, west,east or what?). A rip off by Microsoft for $29 dollars."
1,Horrible!,Doesn't tell you how to get anywhere when used with a GPS...simply shows you where you are. Nothing more than a glorified paper map. A complete embarassment!
1,Can't view the maps,"I originally purchased Streets and Trips 2008, hoping for pocket pc availability, but there was none. So I purchasedMicrosoft Pocket Streets 2005, thinking I could use it as a base from which to download newer maps. However, on downloading to my Dell Axim 30, a message appeared that because the software was created for an older version of Windows Mobile it may not display correctly. Understatement! I can't view any maps, which makes this product of no value for my purposes. I was not aware of a Windows version requirement from the product info provided!"
4,pretty ok,"I think it is better to by the Streets & Trips 2005 because you get a gps device and when you install the software you get pocket streets too so thats more worth it. I think the product is pretty good due to the fact that i use it on my smart phone, its like a map in the palm of my hand. Now my smartphone is my phone, mp3 player, digital camera, oraganizer, hand held map. Also the good thing about streets & trips is that you can save any map to your smartphone from your pc using the software, you are not just limited to the major metro cities on microsoft's dowload site. just make sure you have a large storage card and you can pretty much save a whole state map, just save a new state map whenever you are going to go out of state. i like it because i dont have to subscribe to a data plan or internet service with my phone provider to use the maps. I you do then this is not that good, might as well do mapquest or something but if you don't pay extra for a data plan, this software is perfect."
2,Dentips bulk-Packaged Oral swabs,"The bulk-packed swabs come in 2 clear plastic bags of 500 each. The swabs are not individually wrapped. This leads to sanitary concerns due to handling of the swabs after the outer package has been opened. This producrt is not usable due to risk of infection for the individual involved. The lack of individual wrapping should be pointed out in the pre-sale information posted on the website, but is not. Maybe that is what is meant by ""bulk packaging"". I will return this order."
5,Peter C. Newman is truly a great Canadian !,Peter C. Newman is truly a very remarkable and great Canadian. He is by far the greatest non-fiction writer in Canadian history. Newman is a very remarkable and extraordinary person -- I admire the man !'Here be Dragons' by Peter C. Newman is without a doubt a very very excellent book -- and that is why it is a Canadian best seller. Mr. Newman has led a very outstanding life and his memoirs speak volumes about the greatness of this man.As a Canadian I am proud I got a copy of this great book by a great man for Christmas. Peter C. Newman's life life story is one toadmire and at the end of the day I recommend this book becauseMr. Newman is truly a great Canadian !
1,Tasteless,"I didn't expect this to be real garlicky, but I was surprised by how completely tasteless it is. I added two tablespoons to a pan of homefries and couldn't detect it. The refrigerated minced garlics may be a bit off, but stick with them if you don't want to mince your own."
5,Darling Product,The bracelet in this gift is adorable. My Goddaughter wore it for her baptism and now it will mean even more on her wedding day.
5,Baby shower gift.,"Love it, love it, love it. The quality was even better than I expected, and it was a huge hit at my sisters baby shower. I wanted to give her something special and unique, and it was perfect. I would recommed this for sure."
4,"""Charm"" Bracelet","The Baby to Bride bracelet was a gift for my goddaughter for her first birthday. I thought it was a cute and sentimental idea that I hope she can treasure for a lifetime. This bracelet was adorable and came in a wonderful frame that had a poem explaining the significance of the bracelet. This bracelet definitely ""charmed"" the mom and grandmother and even had them shedding a few tears. Definitely a worthwhile gift for any precious girl."
3,A fan of Caldwell - just not this book,"Trying to write in several voices makes the book hard to follow. Still, ""In Search of Bisco"" has some of the great lines and phrases that make Caldwell one of the great American authors. As a whole I'd recommend his other works which include a couple of classics."
2,eh,"too loud to take in public placesnot multi-speed and it should be because the vibrations are @ too high of a frequency, so the noise level is loud."
4,"A great story, humbly told -","This is a bit of a sleeper. Published as a children's book as i understand it, the story concerns the fate of a man and the life he builds around horses--and Snowman himself, a non-descript, heavy, forgotten horse, by odd chance rescued right out of the slaughterer's trailer. This is a true story--the unlikely horse given a second chance by a man of mercy, and ending up a national and global jumping champion. The meaning here is so important, especially in our times: our gifts are sometimes well hidden, but with courage, mercy, hope - we may find the great things we were born to do. I'm not saying this well. The book is about hope and follow-through, and its virtue is in its meaning rather than its art. The heart of the story is a statement seldom made in our media, and we need it. Oh, we need it. God bless the man who rescued the horse, and recognized the great gift - and allowed this horse his life, and so, room for his joy."
3,It is good for a beginner.,"I bellowed this DVD from local library to see if I really like it. Well..., it is a well-made, well-instructed DVD, but decided not to buy. I personally found that the DVD was too easy for me (will be even easier for me when my exercise level improves). I am a currently moderate-exerciser (run 20min /3-4 day wk, easy weight training /1-2 times wk). I think if you are very new to exercise, it should be a great help for you to start up."
3,good workout but not much pilates,"I liked this video. It did tend to move rather quickly for a begginner like myself who also has no balance. The instructors were really great at motivating you, though at times I felt they moved a little to fast. The pilates moves were not easy and required a great deal of concentration and I had a hard time keeping up at some points. This video has a lot more body sculpting with free weights than it does pilates. I will be checking out a begginers pilates video next time."
5,Great workout!,"I checked out Breakthru-Pilates Sculpt from the library and tried it at home first. Then I bought it online and was very pleased with the product I received. I'm 57, and those young ladies instructions are easy to follow, and since you have it on dvd you can always watch and listen to it again. Yes, their method is preparing me for life's adventure! I recommend this exercise video for those who want a thorough and concise workout that's a good foundation for all their other physical activities. Thanks!"
4,good workout,First a disclaimer--this isn't strictly pilates it's more a fusion workout of weights and some pilates moves. I don't see how you could get bulky doing this workout as you start off with 3-5 pound dumbells. I know a female bodybuilder and you would have to lift alot more than this :)I get sick of regular weight workouts but I love this one. I didn't feel like it was that taxing when I did it...but God I was sore the next day. I think it's good for advanced beginners or intermediates. Great if you know you should add weight but don't really like them.
2,Ambush Cologne,"There are two different types of Ambush cologne - the one pictured and the one that they sent me. The one I got doesn't smell bad, but it's not the same as the one I thought I ordered."
2,disappointed,"I love this author and thought that this book would be wonderful. I love the Cody character, he is a hot guy thoughtful and totally in love. Brynn,comes off as stupid and gulliable. She ruins her relationship with the only guy in the book who loves her. There is also no real ending. Other books by the same author are amazing."
3,Don't Buy it,It's selling for under $10.00 elsewhere. I have the book in very good condition. Not a reprint. Published by W. B. Rose. Chicago. 1919. The price posted here (over $100) implies that it's rare and valuable. It isn't.
5,Fearless Living,"This book was a gift from a dear friend and with it came the power to change my life. I didn't how much I needed Rhonda's program until I read it. This is incredible, path-altering information and Rhonda delivers it in an easy to grasp format that anyone can use. Wonderful book for anyone who has ever felt intimidated by life's challenges - whether in relationships, business, or...?"
2,Time for a New Consciousness,"While, the concept of ""fear"" and how it drives us unconsciously is an excellent channel of examination, I was very disappointed in the book.Based on reading this book and discussions with numerous coaches recently, I believe lifestyle coaching is seriously out of date and does not do a service to individuals when the main focus is on the spiritual aspect of a person's life. Life has become exceptionally unpredictable and the world complex. You cannot tell me that someone who gets cancer got cancer because of a hidden fear or that a person who lost his job through layoff, had a fear of success.I think it is time for the coaching world to examine the UN principles of exercising precaution and sustainability to get real about the complexity of approach it takes these days to earn a living, sustain and protect and care for one's health.Motivational speaking or lectures on how to overcome fear are simply not sufficient anymore."
5,Life changing book,Fearless Living is truly a life changing book. Rhonda give practical advice on how you can change your life! By using the wheel of fear I was able to recognize my own areas of fear and learn how to turn my fear into the wheel of freedom. The book has a workbook style that you can fill out as you go! Everyone should buy this book! Rhonda is great and fearless living is the way to go! Live Fearlessly!
4,"Skip the story, get to the core","Britten writes her dramatic story to get to the fundamental conclusion that we make the life we want.Her method is fantastic, her story quite tragic. My hat to her.What I found most interesting was her concepts of what takes energy from you and what gives you energy. Not necesary the opposite.This book is fanstatic for coaches and leaders who want to bring out the best in people, as well as for those who want to learn more about how to become the best us.Her life story could be a whole book in itself. Her method another, different one. I think that her story distracted from her method."
2,Controling fear.,"I think Rhonda Britten is a powerful author and probably a great coach and trainer for those who fit her description. However, this book combines a vision for living without fear with a need to both create controls in one's life and a sense that we all have the same patterns of reaction to life. Scary book. Although I can see this working for some people it will not work for most people I know. The cycle of fear is real, but the roads into and out of it are much more dynamic and varied. Life is at the same time more surprising, fascinating, complicated, tricky and unpredictable than this book portrays."
3,'Flower Power: Psychedelic Rock Classics' (K-Tel) Various Artists,"Twelve songs by some of the (there were many) late '60's psychedelic giants. One track each from the likes of the Strawberry Alarm Clock, Lovin' Spoonful, Tommy James & The Shondells, Jefferson Airplane, the Lemon Pipers, Count Five (believe or not their entire sole lp is pretty good, as I've heard many fans say the only fine song is ""Psychotic Reaction"") and one band that I, myself didn't recognize by name (at first) - Friend & Lover but I do most certainly remember their one hit ""Reach Out Of Darkness"". Didn't know they had a full album out, as I'll have to check that CD reissue out when I can."
3,AMAZONS GUIDE TO WHAT IT FITS IS WRONG check K&N website for correct fit,AMAZONS GUIDE TO WHAT IT FITS IS WRONG check K&N website for correct fit. I was not smart enough to check it out at K&N website so I had to return it to amazon and they charged me shipping that i had to make a lot of noise about to get it returned to me as they were wrong on their info not me. K&N is still one of the best.
5,Great Size. Good Price.,When I received my bandannas I thought they would be small. But when I opened them they were huge! I was able to fold them up at least 3 times to be able to fit over my face correctly. They also match my BDU's really well. Definatly get this product but watch the shipping though witch is typical with this site.
1,boring,Crazy boring. Was looking for a good read. Failed miserably. Entirely too many pages. Doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
5,Best size option for non-professional,"This is the size to pick for the non-professional, do-it-yourself person. the smaller size is much easier to control.WELL MADE PRODUCT !!"
5,fab cuticle nippers,"fantastic product this is my second purchase of these cuticle nippers to have as a spare pair they are great sharp and havent let me down in four years of having them,definitely worth purchasing."
5,THE FIRST AND ONE OF THE BEST,"The B.O.C. try a good number of musical styles in this first album, but most of it is pure HEAVY METAL. I recommend anyone who appreciates the heavy metal beast to buy this first effort by B.O.C. and stack it up next to LED ZEPPELIN III as one of the definitive collections of the 70's."
4,Bringing back the memories!!!,"Sixteen years ago, in my wild high school days, this was THE album I related to. I was never a huge BOC fan, and I currently don't listen to the rock-n-roll that I used to - but I had this album, literally on vinyl...and came looking at Amazon.com for the title. I promptly ordered it when I found it on CD. Anyone out there heard of EBN OZN? I am looking, too, for this album...Anyway - this early BOC collection is just simply awesome. HID"
5,Fascinating First Album...,"It certainly doesn't sound like a first album. The ideas are great, and the sound mature, heavy, yet flexible and flowing naturally, like a river. This is easily classic rock, even though not as well known. Fantastic guitar on 'I'm on the Lamb...', ominous darkness in 'Screams', great feelings in the quiet but unsettling 'Last Days of May', and really heavy rock in 'Cities on Flame' and 'Transmaniacon MC'. So much to enjoy in this CD. The two highly original closing tracks 'Workshop of the Telescopes' and 'Redeemed' alone can get you high... A brilliant album!"
5,Excellent Critical Reasoning Book,This book is great if you want a high score (high 700s) and don't have a ton of time to study. I only had one month to study for the GMAT and wanted books that would really maximize my time studying for my weaker areas. It was easy enough to read and understand so I was able to cover it over a weekend (albeit with not many breaks). I imagine it would be even more effective if you have more time to study. The structure used for types of questions was extremely helpful for me in getting the tougher questions right more often. I used this book along with the Powerscore Sentence Correction Book. A few more practice problems would have been nice. I found the PowerScore questions to be harder than the OG ones. I also bought the Official Guide and the EZ Advanced and EZ Logic and Stats.
5,The sun is out of this world,Outstanding book. There are a lot of things coming from the sun we never think of; it is not simply a large version of an infrared lamp. After reading this book you will never look at the sun in the same way.
5,Best Young Adult Writer,"If you want some of the best, fun-loving, clean, moral stories for your kids (and you!) to read--read Sid Fleischman. His protagonists are moral, his antagonists are ""bad""--not ""evil""--and his storylines are unique and (somewhat) plausible. These stories are typically set in the ""olden days,"" and are a refreshing retreat from the sci-fi, futuristic, and sometimes coarse and violent literature so prevalent today. You and your kids WILL have fun reading Sid Fleischman's books, including Chancy and the Grand Rascal."
1,"Old, Old, Old","The release date is listed as 2005. I think this video was actually produced in the 80s or early 90s. It covers topics for the professional photographer (weddings, portraits, painting backdrops) using film cameras - not digital."
5,Come Clarity - In Flames,I have every album of In Flames so far and this is by far their best album. The singer definetly demonstrates his singing skills.
2,Where Have In Flames Gone?,"I really don't understand why this album is getting such good ratings. When I listened to this album, I thought of the worst two words a band could hear: SELL OUT.In Flames seemingly forgot about their past and, for lack of better words, good musical side, and conformed to today's thrash metal characteristics. Their loved harmonized guitar solos and riffs have been tossed away for a more steady form of rhythmic guitar, and the vocals just suck. I appreciated Soundtrack to Your Escape because In Flames nearly found the perfect combination between electronics and their good sound, but on Come Clarity I don't hear In Flames at all. The only reason I gave this album any stars at all is because I love In Flames and what they did for music.I don't recommend buying this. Even the Jester is upset and emo in the foldout cover of this album, and now I can understand why."
3,eh i guess....,"well this release doesn't set me on fire, but it is a respectable album. they reinvented their sound while not changing too much. it has harmonies and melodies and i think at moments it does sound catchy. it doesn't live up to their old stuff but its worthy none the less.my only beef is anders vox. his voice sounds really hardcore, which sounds really annoying after awhile. he sounds really whiny. other than that, i think its pretty good."
5,i'm impressed,"this is the first album i feel deserves my input......just after i was losing hope for in flames, they totally slap me in the face with such a well done album, there last couple albums have been bummers but this album will kick you in the ass just like there old albums did"
2,A band now but rising smoke...,"After reading several reviews from several sources including Metal Maniacs and multiple websites, I actually thought that ""Come Clarity"" might give me some of the same excitement I experienced with ""The Jester Race, Whoracle, and Colony."" However, after my first listen to the record, my reaction was to question all of the hype people have made over this release. True, more solos grace this record than did the last two, but the production, on par with the last two CDs, is HORRIBLE!!! Add in more of Anders' increasingly punk-esque screams, and I thought little more of this record than a glorified, hyped-up punk/hardcore work with a few decent solos...2 stars is a gift. I'm sure many previous fans wrote off this band after ""Colony"" or ""Clayman."" But even as an open-minded metal-listener, I decided to give this record a try...to no avail. New listeners, check out pre-Clayman records from this band if you want a REAL piece of Gothenburg Metal."
1,...,"Every song is trash and emo. I can't believe this is the same band that produced Clayman, Colony and Whoracle."
4,good cd - 3.5 stars,"After the last 2 In Flames albums (Reroute and Soundtrack) coupled with in flames' signing to a terrible (in my opinion) record label, Ferret (which i really don't understand because In Flames is not hardcore), i thought the new cd would be even worse. It was a pleasant surprise when i first heard it though. There are some good songs and some okay songs and 1 just song that is just terrible (Scream). Still, this cd does not really compete with any of the cds from clayman and back but is clearly better than reroute and soundtrack. My personal favorites are Crawl Through Knives, Versus Terminus, and Vanishing Light."
2,Not his best work,"This is the only Shannara series that I did not like. I read it anyway jsut to get some understanding of the Isle witch (who makes far more interesting appearance in later works). I think this is worth reading, but it is not the wonderful Terry Brooks I devour so eagerly."
5,Terry Brooks The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara Trilogy,Terry Brooks is a master! I have read all his books and this trilogy was one of the best. I love his style of writing. He sucks you in by the end of the 1st page. I read this trilogy before I read any other Terry Brooks books. What a opening! I have since read every book he has written. I think I would have started off closer to the start of the story. But I just back tracked from there. I would tell anyone would likes to read fantasy to read any Terry brooks book. He is the best!
4,Excellent Fantasy Trilogy,"This is just another great trilogy from one of the masters of fantasy. Its epic, suspenseful, and dramatic story will definitely keep you reading. This actual copy itself is a little bit on the heavy side because all of the books are included in one big hardback book. Some people may want to get this in the three separate books so as to lighten the load, especially when lying down and reading.Excellent story though. Will leave you wanting more."
5,another excellent trilogy,"This trilogy, along with the original Sword Of Shannara trilogy, and the Heritage Of Shannara trilogy, begins with the excellent Voyage Of The Jerle Shannara, Ilse Witch (which I'm concluding listening to in audio) and look forward to listening to/reading the other parts as well and the Heritage Of Shannara volumes."
5,Theatrical mayhem in Lobelia Falls,"Ever wondered about the origins of Dangerous Dan McGrew? You know, from the famous poem by Robert Service? Okay, maybe not a FAMOUS poem, but a good one. In this funny story, the Grub-and-Stakers decide to act out the play in the hopes of winning a literary competition. Naturally, things don't go as planned, and someone winds up dead. I really like Alisa Craig and I wish her books were more available. I really recommend this one."
2,For small children,"Camera works ok, although no bells and whistles. The add made no mention of needing corner store disposible non-recharging batteries, which was somewhat subjective since most would assume a video camera would have electric plug and or rechargeable batteries. Good gift for a small child only."
2,Video Camera,"Was not happy with it when I got it. It did come when it was suppose to. But it looked, felt and is just a very cheap plastic camera. Looked different in the picture. Did not work easy. I would not get another 1. I feel it was more product not company unhappiness."
1,you get what you pay for,this is a terrible toy not a good camera at all this item would not impress a five year old
1,HORIBLE!,"The camera's quality was crap. batteries never lasted and it broke after about a week. It was a complete waste of time, money, batteries and energy"
3,A really nice story of twins,"The twins are identical at first,but as they get older(if only by several months)they become less identical.Twins,as children,love confusing people and doing double-acts,but if they don't outgrow the novelty they outgrow being exactly identical. Carolyn Haywood wrote fun books for children."
4,Worth the the money for fuel savings.,"I drive a 1990 F150 4x4 with a 5 speed that gets about ten mpg going downhill with a tailwind. After doing a lot of research I decided to pull the trigger because Amazon is the cheapest price for a brand new system. The kit itself is awesome all necessary brackets and it looks awesome, really cleans up the engine bay. As far as a performance gain there is a slight difference in the top end but nothing to write home about. Fuel economy is where I was actually impressed. On the highway I average about 13 going exactly 60. Once I put this on I took a long trip and averaged about 14.7 more or less. All in all worth the money if you do a lot of highway driving. The best part, no more cheap paper filters!"
5,wonderful birthday gift!,"i got this for my birthday, actually on Valentines day and i love her! She is the most pretty and classy pony i own!"
4,Fun for CCD class!,Played it w/ 4th Graders during religion Christmas party. They loved it! Will play again throughout the year!
2,Sounds Don't Really Match Real Words,These cards require a pretty big leap of imagination to match them up with the Bible verse. We grew quickly frustrated.
5,A hit with our Confirmation class,"Our church's 6th grade Confirmation class meets every Sunday so during school breaks when our attendance is low, we like to do fun activities to reinforce Bible knowledge. This game was a big hit with the kids! Since it's small and easy to carry, I also keep it on hand to play when we finish a lesson early. A few of the puzzles are a bit too difficult so I've culled them out; most of the puzzles can be solved by Bible novices so all the students can enjoy playing it."
2,Not so much fun :(,"Not nearly as much fun as we had hoped. It was hard to hear myself think with others guessing out loud. The opposing team seemed to have the same issue. Also, the cards were either too easy or way too difficult. This is a great idea for a game, but in practice it looses its appeal rather quickly."
1,Very Bad,"Hi people,purchased this product after reading reviews.Very bad choice. It has something in it that fills very stickey,and it has aluminum and a lot of other things that are not good for your skin.I wish the ingredents were listed so you can no before you get it home and find out the junk thats in the stuff. I would not recommed this to anybody. Don't like the way it smells, and again very stickey when you put it under your arms."
5,Smells fabulous,"The first day I wore it my co-worker had to endure my constant updates on how amazing my armpits smelled. Considering I'm someone that NEVER discusses personal hygiene proves it's one fantastic product. Seriously though, my armpits do smell delectable."
4,Look at History from an Alarming Perspective,"This book recounts in detailed, well documented ways how famines occured in various regions of the world because of El Nino and La Nina weather patterns. This part of the author's message is not difficult to believe, though the science and climatology is complex. The alarming assertion, also extrodinarily well documented, is that British (and other European nations"") colonial rule in these areas disrupted the ways in which these cultures traditionally handled famine conditions by focusing the local economies on profit making enterprises benefitting the British, and responded with incredible callousness to the utter misery that resulted. Those who generally think of the British as a civilized, Christian people will be shaken by their deliberate actions which caused millions of deaths. My criticism of the book is the absence of a summary chapter, and the lack of editing for readability. This book is difficult to read, and should be widely read."
4,Davis Book,"An interesting take on hurricanes in Cuba. Very interesting when compared to the United States. Read this book for a history of natural disasters class. If you are interested in natural disaster, consider reading Kenneth Hewitt's work about natural disaster from the point of a geologist."
3,El Nino Did it,The author makes a good argument that millions of people from India and China died as a result of uncaring policies developed by the British during El Ninos in the nineteenth century. I would have preferred that the author spend less time on British policies and more time on the nature of El Ninos.
3,"Yep, they're underwear","Actually these are pretty comfortable, I wear them while hiking, biking, walking and talking. Sometimes while sleeping or watching TV but hardly ever while swimming. They're expensive but for what they are they do what they are suppose to."
2,UnderArmour boxer jock,"I had a little trouble ordering what I wanted. First, I ended up with boxers that were almost like panties. Then I got loose boxers of regular length and I really wanted the firmer gripped ones. I would have liked more specific info so I could have made a better decision. I even tried to match UnderArmor numbers, but non provided. The picture makes them look like a snug fit. I ended up sending my son ( serving in Middle East way away from any PX stores)used ones from my other son. Also when you look at the shopping cart, it doesn't tell you what size you ordered, before placing your order. They did refund my First order promtly and I do appreciate that."
3,only good for schools,Great woman and story and excellent for teachers and principalsI thought there would be a lot of good life lessons 'outside of the classroom' but found there weren't
5,The Perfect Task Lamp,"I've had one for nearly 20 yrs and just ordered 2 more after Googling them. Delighted to find they're still made! Small, discrete, elegant, versatile and shed some good light anywhere you need it. The easily adjustable height is genius! These will go on my kitchen counters to help with chopping, etc. with the other still perched on my desk. A perfectly wonderful little lamp!"
1,"Very unfriendly and useless software, acceptable book","Since I needed a mouse brain atlas for my work I asked around what others recommend. I went out and bought this product with great expectations. The book is OK, but only shows the coronal sections of the brains. The worst part is the totally useless 4 CD ROM. I am quite familiar with computers and programs but I was not able to use it. Looks like one PhD is not enough to use this very unfriendly program....If you don't register than you are not able to use the help and other feature. But if you have problem with the registration (as I had) than you are stucked.The bottom line is: very unfriendly and useless program for the mere 160$. Look elsewhere if you need a brain atlas."
5,Can mopping be fun?,"Well, it can be fun if you own this handy-dandy MysticMaid mop! Cleans floors like a demon with no messy mop water! Just take off the mop pad, rinse and keep cleaning. The amount of dirt this thing picks up is incredible! Great mop!"
1,Giving up on it,I wanted to like this mop after reading all the reviews and ordering it. I have had it for a few months now. My husband hates it. I have come to hate it. The bottom part CONSTANTLY flips over and the metal scrapes the floors.
4,Great at cleaning but...,"This mop is great and fast at cleaning. I have just one negative comment. You cannot wring out this mop while it is on the handle. You have to take it off first, then rinse it, wring it out and put it back on the applicator. I didn't realize this at first and I ended up with a floor that was too wet and dried spotted. If there was a way to wring it out while it is on the applicator it would be the perfect mop!"
2,Light duty only,What can a mop that doesn't get rinsed really clean up? Unless your floor is almost spotless to begin with this is not effective at anything other than spreading the dirt around.The other item to consider is washing the pads. I threw one of these in with a load of lights (cold wash) and it didn't come out clean when I pulled it out of the dryer and had a not so good smell. So now I am a bit reluctant to throw these things in with clothes/sheets especially with an HE washer. They really need hot water and bleach and a load that you feel comfortable washing them with.
3,Mystic mop and pad!,"I didn't have a very high expectation nor was I judgmental~ Turned out to be pretty steady mop! This is my first mop, so I don't know what to expect from a mop! It did pick up the dirt, but I wasn't amazed by ths product's work! So I would give a 3 star~"
4,Good sittin-on-the-front-stoop blues!,"Prototypical Northwest blues, full of life, close to home, fun ear-catching original music."
5,This Guy's Got A Serious Muse,Great stuff. Everything works. Where has he been all these years? We want more!
4,Boa 9150T Garage Laser Parking Sensor,"Decent quality product for the price, easy to use and install. And seems to work well."
3,Great show bad not awesome DVD,"This is my least favorite season of my favorite show, but I have issues with the DVD. It comes with all the episodes on a dual sided DVD. These don't play in older DVD players, and generally just annoy me. Then it came with a separate bonus features disk. The bonus features are have poorly. The DVD menus look cheap and have very annoying music. Although I do have to say I was impressed that they put the lack of special stuff from season 3 on here, its still a slightly disappointing bonus disk."
5,Awesome show!,I love the show! It took me ages to finally purchase and watch the final season. I just wish they would've continued the show!
3,Hated the ending.,You can tell this series was cut off short--the ending is not what anyone seemed to have wanted. Disappointed to say the least.
2,Tried to impress my boyfriend with this California treat,"my boyfriend is from California and complains that he can not get Italian Dry Salami in Wisconsin. So as a surprise I ordered him this salami. (the customer service, was remarkable) When the salami arrived it was still very moist, so we hung out to dry. About a week later my boyfriend - eyes aglow - cut it open and was extremely disappointed at how much more fat there was in this salami than the ones he remembers or the ones his brother occasionally sends him.he ate the salami. but he said it was, eh, nondescript. About two weeks later his brother sent him dry salami, and he cut it open for me to see. The salami should be dry right away when you get it, and he was right there seemed to be a lot less fat in the second salami - and it had a lot less greasy taste."
1,works or not,not what i expected for real stuff more fat taste than any thing grease after taste like lard sandwich in the back of your mouth never agian
2,artjoy,"Very disappointed. There are no recent pictures of Billy Eckstine during his more popular time, most, if not all the films are about his formative years during the 1940's,this is the main reason I bought the DVD,Dizzy is O.K.Billy was very popular during the 1950's, and 1960's,and there is nothing,so I'm still looking."
4,A consistent pleaser,"My son was given this book for his first birthday and it's been a consistent favorite since. The text is extremely simple and repetitive which I think is good for very young readers. I am sure this book is one of the reasons that ""hot"" was one of his first words. However, I think the main reason that he likes it is because we both bang the pages hard as I say ""splash!"" and likewise act out ""whoosh sploosh"" and ""squirt squirt"". For this reason our copy is looking pretty battered by now - but we've had a lot of fun along the way!"
5,A masterful presentation,"Big, bold, and bright are words that describe McDonnell's expressive illustrations. Warm yellows and then cooler blue undertones subtly reinforce the heat, and subsequent refreshment you can almost feel along with the sweltering jungle animals who find a fun way to cool down on a hot, hot day-a rich accompaniment to the slim, streamlined, straightforward text. Well done!"
5,STUNNING,"I spent the entire six hour drive home for Thanksgiving listening to Poe's Haunted. This is excellcent, and even better than Hello. When I first heard that Poe's CD was coming out I was praying that it was going to be good, since my cousin, Olle Romo helped produce it, but it's more than great - it's stunning. It is so beautiful on the surface, and as you listen to the words and find out the background to how the music developed, you find new levels that make each time you listen to Haunted a different experience. BUY THIS CD! YOU WILL NOT RERET IT!!!"
5,In a word AWESOME !,"And now for something entirely new, familiar, but Haunted is like nothing before. Poe's long awaited follow up CD to Hello is well worth the wait. Do not expect a continuation of Hello; Haunted is worlds from away from Hello on so many levels and all the tightly woven threads of Haunted going in an emphatic direction. Haunted certainly shows maturity and a progression into a new, different, sound and feel of Poe's music. The seventeen tracks flow one into another traveling a tremendous distance taken the listener along for a splendid ride from one emotional extreme to another. It's cool, hip, sophisticated, and effulgent. It is inescapable, grabs the listener's attention and leaves you on the edge of what is to come next. Whew... what is to come from Poe next? What ever it is it should prove to be very interesting."
5,BUY THIS C-D...,"you definitly won't be upset with this haunting CD, all of the tracks are awsome and have to do with Poe's hardships in life (mainly her father dieing). This is a great CD with tons of tracks! PLUS it has the hit song ""Hey Pretty"" and ""Wild"" from the Blair witch Project 2 (the book of shadows) and a special Re-mix of ""Hey pretty"" as the last track feturing her brother (the writer of The House of Leaves book)!"
4,Solid album all the way through (3.5 stars),"I was introduced to Poe quite awhile ago while watching a documentary about Alanis Morissette in 1997. Six years later I finally picked up a Poe CD and overall I am impressed. Poe has a nice voice with limited range but it's suitable for what she does and she does it quite well. I don't have a particular favourite on this album because all of the songs seem to mesh well together and that's a good thing. My only complaint is that the production tends to go overboard on some songs but that is only a minor complaint considering Poe's lyrics, which are quite impressive. I hope to hear more from Poe in the future!"
5,I give this album as many stars as there are in the sky!!!,"I have been a Poe fan ever since I heard Trigger Happy Jack off of her album Hello. When the Haunted album was released I immediately bought it too. I still listen to this album more than once a week, it is my favorite album of all time. Poe's voice is purely magical and the lyrics, combined with the music are so deep you almost feel as if you are travelling along with her on a journey. I cannot compare this music to anything I have ever heard, I can only say that it is just wonerful and I can't imagine someone not liking it! Her lyrics alone are simply mesmerizing, as is the music which can range from beautiful ballads to rock. Listening to this with headphones amplifies all of the sounds in the background. I love her style and she is in my opinion ""hands down"" the most wonderful thing to ever grace the music scene!"
1,About the Book House of Leaves,"Thought anyone interested in this album would like to know that most if not all the songs are about the book her father wrote called ""House of Leaves"". Its a terribly interesting book and if you like Poe it might give you a little more insight into her music on this cd."
5,"Best Pop Concept Album since OK, Computer","My initial reaction to this ambitious album was ""catchy, pretty, but not terribly profound."" I've changed my mind on that, there are many levels to this album. 200 listens later, I can't stop listening to 6 of the songs on the album."" In it's passion, melody, poetry, and craftsmanship, it reminds me of Kate Bush's best and Sinead O' Connor's ""Lion and the Cobra"".This is a great work of art."
5,The best concept album I've ever heard,This album replaces The Wall as the most well done concept album I've ever heard. Its constant change in tone and tempo held together with really CREEPY segues makes it easy to listen to over and over again.
4,Soundtrack for House of Leaves,"Poe's album shares many things with Mark Danielewski's book, House of Leaves (a 5 1/2 minute hallway, an Expedition B, a Johnny, a haunting, and that's just for starters). Poe and Mr. Danielewski may have shared a father as well: the late documentary filmmaker Tad Danielewski.If you loved the book House of Leaves as much as I did, pick up Poe's Haunted as a soundtrack for when you decide to read it again! If you love this album, be sure to try out the book. It's not like any other you've read before, I promise."
4,"Better than ""Hello""...","I'm so pleased Poe followed up ""Hello"" and the success of ""Angry Johnny"" (fodder for more inane guy-humor jokes than Alanis' 'You Oughta Know') with such a complete offering as ""Haunted"".Okay, she takes the concept album a little far with the spooky outtakes and voice messages and whatnot, but still the whole thing works. So impressive and unexpected.Favorite songs on the CD: Haunted, Wild, Hey Pretty, and Could Have Gone Mad (damn girl, you've got some Shirley Manson in you. who knew?). Especially 'Wild'. But the song doesn't really need to be 9 minutes long."
5,Beginning to End- This CD is a must-listen...,"There are very few albums I like from beginning to end (NIN Pretty Hate Machine, Tori Amos Little Earthquakes, Sarah McLachlan Fumbling Towards Ecstacy), but Poe's Haunted is an absolutely amazing album.The variety of influences in evidence makes this a great choice for anyone who enjoys the ""art"" of making music. Poe brings great lyrics and a sexy, lower-register voice that she wields with passion and confidence.Too many great songs to name a favorite, but the album closer is a touching and wonderful song that will speak to anyone who has lost someone close to them."
4,Awaiting yet another POE release,"Haunted is a very nice release that follows up to her amazing Hello from 1995. The sounds are spectacular and the instrumental arrangements cover virtually every facet of recorded music.There are tracks containing elements of trip-hop that would please any Portishead fan. Nice guitar riffs reminiscent of Oasis are present in ""Terrible Thought"" and ""5 1/2 Minute Hallway"".In a recent interview, Poe said that another release will come to be in the near future. Hopefully, that will be so. She is one of the most creative artists to have come out in the last 10 years.It is sad to have read that of all the reviews that Poe can recall, the undeserved two-star rating of Haunted from Rolling Stone (What kind of stuff does this guy like, anyway? Obviously stuff that I would not enjoy.) is the one that stands out in her mind the most.Don't listen to the browbeaters, Poe!! Just keep up the good work!"
5,Love this CD from Amazon!,This is a really unique and beautiful CD. Each song is powerful and moving in its own right. I would recommend this CD to anyone who appreciates real music.
5,Original-Creative-Masterpiece perhaps Genius,"Its rare to find someone who breaks-out from the crowd with originality and brilliance, this is it.As stated by other posters, you have to read the history behind the LP to get it, and one listen won't get you there, ""do you get the gist now""?Every track on the album is worth owning.If Poe is a sweet narcotic, we are her subjects. Unfortunately, the music has all but stopped.After this LP and her apparent fall out with the recording company, Poe recorded with Rhys Fulber of Delerium fame in a project called Conjure One and produced one Masterpiece and one very good LP.Conjure OneRhys knows how to crank out the LPs and Poe knows how to write them and perform them. It would be nice to see them team up as producers and Poe singing some of the tracks if she still has her voice, which I suspect she does."
2,Upbeat alterna-pop music with scarey morse interludes,"After buying into all of the hype about this album, I bought the album, to discover it's a pleasant mix of pop vocals and alternative guitars and light drums. Even though all of the songs are fairly good with Poe's lyrics about growing up in a bad environment (abusive father, reclusive mother). She even provides inspirational lyrics for women, and information about raising a child such as ""don't mess with a girl's dreams, or she will grow up mean."" The music on the album is upbeat, so it is hampered by the interludes between each of the tracks. The name of the album is also the theme of the album, because the interludes sound like your listening to a haunted house, with spooky sounds, and a little girl's scary memories (those being Poe's). These interludes last anywhere between 30 seconds and two minutes, which is probably why I have not heard any songs from this album on the radio."
1,those 30 second previes are misleading...,"okay, I looooved poe's first album. LOVED IT! I bought this one as soon as I could. Listened to the first thirty seconds of esch and decided this was going to be the GREATEST ALBUM EVER!Got it home... the 1st 30 seconds of each song ARE really good, but it goes straight downhill. I gave it away the next day. The girl I gave it to also gave it away. A copy of this can go along way."
2,Ambitious failure.,"It's clear that the artist had aspirations to make a concept album, and while the outcome would deserve the name, it is, unfortunately, not very good. There are the seeds of an excellent straight-up record here, but they get strangled by the excessive production and overuse of spoken word snippets and sound effects."
5,Necessary,"If you have a 2005 Sportster you better have the manuel. Things in the Clymer aren't alwys up to date with Harley specifications. IF YOU ARE GOING TO WORK WITH YOUR ELECTRICAL SYSTEM GET THE HARLEY MANUES. Don't be one of those d-bags that ends up cutting his wires and taking his spedo and signals off. No one believes you did it on purpose cause ""real bikes don't havew em."""
4,The Wonder of You,"I had the vinyl version of The Wonder of You and like it a lot, and watched Sandpipers perform on stage in my hometown at the American Officers Club in mid 70's. Guanta..was very popular at that time, but in early 80's, I found ""Let Go"", ""Wave"", ""That Night"", ""Yellow Bird"" are just so long lasting becasue of its romantic jazzy tune. I should have given it 5 stars even though there are only 7 songs on this CD that I play a lot. ""Temptation"", ""The Wonder of You"", ""Misty Roses"". Playing these old tunes driving down Northern Californial coast highway or in Foster City by the water in a wintry day only make these old tunes so much alive again. So, I bought this CD and will not either sell or give it away and that's how good this CD is."
5,Another great book in this series,"This 166-page book is a good addition to the What Life Was Like series. Every page is filled with color photos of maps, statuary, wall paintings, and everyday objects - children's toys, soldiers gear, bath implements, coins, rings, etc. It is written for the casual reader with vivid, easy to read text. Some of the subjects briefly touched upon: the lives/reigns of Julius Caesar, Augustus and Hadrian; the lives and daily routines of everyday people; soldiers and war; gladiators and games; artisans, and tradespeople, etc. Also recommended: WLWL On the Banks of the Nile (Egypt 3050-30BC)."
4,Very informative!,"This book was a perfect! I got it one week before my new circle. It gave me great ideas for my all women circle, I'm proud to say it was a hit!!It could have been a little more condensed, the stories are good but it was a little much. I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking of starting a circle. Specially an all women's circle!"
5,Forning a Circle Without Nervousness,"I wanted to start a Women's Spirituality Group but I never started any kind of group. I was not sure where to begin and that is where Sacred Circles came into play. I read the book, highlighted what I felt was important and then followed the suggestions. Sacred Circles walked me through step-by-step with the planning. It suggested how to run the first meeting and ideas for future meetings. After I told my friend about the book and she read some of it, she agreed to be my partner. This was the most informing book that I found on the subject. It took the edge off a new endeavor."
5,WONDER-FULL,"WHAT AN AMAZING BOOK - LIKE BRINGING IN A NEW FRIEND FOR TEA! THIS IS ONE OF THOSE GREAT ""WOMAN FRIENDSHIP"" TITLES, ONE THAT I TRULY TREASURE AND HAVE SHARED WITH MANY OTHER WOMEN IN MY OWN SACRED COMMUNITY. BLESSED BE!"
4,Good book on dreams and interpretation,"Another in the excellent ""New Consciousness Reader"" series. This book is a compliation from some of the heavyweights in the world of dream study."
1,This game sucks.,"Hello all, This game I would not recommend. You have to go into the first place and do 3 hunting jobs....then go to the next place and do 3 more. There aren't very many places. The graphics SUCK! I would rather play on computer or XBox. The animals are robotic, there are hardly any sounds, its like paper cut outs. You shoot it and pick it up and its over. No fun it looking for it or hearing ther far away crys, or seeing what you can use to lure it like bait and stuff. I beat this game all in one day except for one mission I beat the next day. If i'd have known how crappy this game would be I would not have purchased it. Waste of my money. I WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT....STICK WITH BIGGER NINTENDO SYSTEMS OR COMPUTERS FOR THIS GAME."
3,"detailed, in depth study",Although I am interested in colour and language this book is a VERY and I mean VERY in depth study of colour in the two languages. I don't think that the public at large will take an interest in this work.
5,Best version of this Japanese classic,"McCullough's rendition of this classic Japanese tale of warfare is, compared to other translations I've studied, the most eloquent and poetic available to westerners."
1,Confused,"I had to read this book for a course I took in Japanese civilization and culture. I found it very hard to follow even with some background. There are so many differnt names in just one paragraph that it is impossible to keep track of them all, let alone try to figure out what is going on."
2,Very basic stuff,Very basic information that models most ethical teaching in most religions. What information that is here about the Inca is readily available on the internet. If you are interested in a good over of Incan and Mayan world views then try Return of the Children of Light: Incan and Mayan Prophecies for a New World.
4,Delkin Pop up Shade review,"This item is very effect in blocking light from viewing pictures.one small drawback is the fact that the slide lock is not very secure.overall, I am glad that I purchased this item."
1,"Nice display, but the case is poorly engineered","The display is excellent - it's a good size and the backlighting makes it legible in most conditions (although having the backlight on really chews up the battery power). However, there appears to be a design flaw in the case. I purchased my 2010c in September 1998, and within 2 months, the plastic hinge on the left-hand side fractured, making the unit unusable. I returned the unit to the Compaq service facility, who replaced it free of charge. In May this year, the hinge on the second unit fractured in exactly the same place. I'm going to ask Compaq to replace it again, but the warranty will expire in September, so if the third one breaks, I'm out of luck. This is a high-end product with a high-end price tag: this kind of failure just shouldn't happen."
2,Works well when it works...,"I like this keyboard for the key-weight and the multimedia/shortcut buttons on the top. The mouse responds very well on a variety of surfaces. Then, on the other hand, there are the connectivity issues. The keyboard will randomly shut off while you are typing so you have to hit keys for 30 seconds until it recognizes that it is being used. Other times, it loses the connection with the bluetooth receiver before it sends the ""end"" command to the computer. It endlessly types the last letter you pressed until it resets, and there's no way to stop it.As was stated before, you'll have to have a hardwired keyboard if you need to access the BIOS during startup. The keyboard isn't recognized until windows starts. I'm not sure if this is common with bluetooth devices, but it's something to be aware of."
1,Keyboard and mouse lose connectivity,"I should've read the reviews before buying this combo. Since I was a DELL customer for the last decade, I didn't suspect that DELL would sell such cheap products. I got this new precision workstation and bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Both keyboard and mouse lose connectivity with the computer. I have to reset the mouse 2-3 times every week. Keyboard is worse; I need to reset it 5-6 times every day. Yes, every day! My keyboard and mouse are just 2 feet away from the damn USB connector. And still it needs resetting. It is really frustating to work with this combo. If there's a way to give it a 0 star, I would."
3,Still not the best fit...,"I purchased this battery to complement my portable DVD player. We use it for my daughter's entertainment during long trips and the battery it came with only lasts less then two hours. Because the DVD player is all systems all regions, we needed to find something to extend the life of battery without having to plug it in. This product was supposed to fit pretty much anything including our DVD player, but it doesn't... We still continue to use it, but the plug sneaks out at times which causes a pretty big uproar from our daughter... Make sure you check if one of the plugs it comes with fits your product."
1,Not the right fit.,"I guess I don't know how good this product is because it is not compatible with my Magnavox DVD player. The description of it ""DOES NOT"" tell you what portable players it can link to so be careful and check first to see if it will work. I just think it is poor that Amazon does not put the compatible units on the website."
4,Made our flight easier,"Worked fine with our new Philips PD7012/377"" LCD Dual-Screen Portable DVD Player on our transatlantic flight. Our little girls watched for at least 3 hours with no sign of the battery giving up. Loses a star because, unlike most dc power supplies these days, the one that came with this only works off 110V (rather than 100-240V) so we had to rely on finding a shaver socket to charge it in Europe."
1,Childish and not funny,"We didn't watch the whole movie, and I'd like to get the time we watched it back, what a total waste of time."
5,Great Movie...Great Cast,Saw the movie at the VA Film Festival. Great Cast. Wonderful Story. Kevin Hart was amazing. David Denman and Gillian Jacobs had great chemistry on screen.
1,Sold out in theater???????,"I do not understand how come this movie had a good rate. I've never seen bad acting like that. A big 1 star for the effort of copying Blair witch project!!! Do not buy it, it's not worth it."
2,Not so good.,"The concept behind this monitor is great. When the portable unit is hooked up to the television in our bedroom, it works wonderfully to see in the nursery. However, we purchased this product two months prior to our daughter being born. After she was born, we hooked up the unit, and after a couple of days the portable unit's screen quit working. It still works great hooked up to the TV, but we purchased it because of it's portability, and it no longer has that capability. Even though we only used the portable unit for a couple of days before it broke, we had purchased it long before we opened it, and now the return/warranty doesn't allow us to return it. Love the monitor when it's hooked up to the TV, but be aware of the possibility of the screen going out on the hand held unit rendering it no longer completely portable."
3,Pretty good after trying others,I bought another video monitor first and it was bad. Static for both video and sound.It turns out it was not a good fit for my house but it worked great for a town house so ended up getting this one. I've had no issue with it other than the battery dying too fast. It won't hold through the nigh so I have to keep it plugged in. Other than that I'm pretty happy with it.
2,"Not a great product, I wasted my money","Well, the first few hrs it seemed to work well, the the signal was poor after that and then it shots off after a couple of hours of using it. It does this every night, there is so much static I cannot see the baby. Sometimes I can barely see the baby on the screen. Sometime I wake up and the screen is off even though I am using AC adapter. There is hardly any color most of the time, it might as well be black-and white. I am so disappointed with this product."
4,Portable color video,"First one received failed out of box, called the number in manual and they sent a whole new set. This one works good but get a lot of static turn volume down so you don't hear static and you don't hear child"
2,Read some REAL biographies instead...,"I didn't find this book the least bit inspiring. If you've ever read individual biographies of a few of the people the author covers in the book (namely Brunelleschi, Columbus, Copernicus, Elizabeth I, Shakespeare, Jefferson, Darwin, and Ghandi), then you probably won't find anything new or particularly inspiring about the book either. If on the other hand you don't even know who the above people are, then this book is for you!However, I found this to be an excellent example of how to package your high school research papers into a commercial book. Seriously, for someone who is supposed to be an engaging and uplifting speaker, the author didn't deliver."
5,Journey Through Intellectual History...,"Although I found the individual biographies fascinating ( especially Plato, Brunelleschi and Elizabeth 1) the best thing about this book is the journey through intellectual history. Gelb shows how Plato set the stage for the evolution of the way we see the world today. The ""Gestalt"" of this genius survey deepened my appreciation for the influences that shape our current paradigms. And, a bonus: The original watercolor portraits of the geniuses by Norma Miller are hauntingly beautiful."
1,Don't waste your money,"Elizabeth I, a genius? Columbus, a genius? This book isn't about genius; it's about making money for the author. The history is often flawed, and the thinking exercises are a joke. For example, contemplating and then writing about your ten favorite architectural structures is supposed to bring out your architectural genius. It may teach you to be more observant, but it certainly doesn't bring you closer to becoming a genius. The book is filled with twisted history and similarly vapid exercises.Do a little research to find a good book on performance improvement. Don't waste your time or money on junk like this."
3,Nothing groundbreaking,"I thought the short biographies were interesting. I listened to the audio book while I was driving. A sizeable portion of the book was exercises, most of which didn't interest me. A few of them made me think a tiny bit. The good thing this book did do for me, was got me interested in the author's choice of a dream team. It sparked me to do some of my own research with his choices."
2,Expected more,I bought this magazing hoping it would have some recipes and good ideas for a Thanksgiving dinner. It is not bad though there was not one recipe. And the Thanksgiving section is really short.
4,Doing Time : Prison Experience and Identity Among First Time,"Excelent, that topic really excelent to rehabilitation offender in prison."
5,The Pointer Sisters at their best!!,"I Loved this collection of hits, and every song on this is an instant classic!!! My personal favorites include Dare Me, Back in my Arms, Neutron Dance, Jump (for my love), I'm So Excited, Twist My Arm, I Will Be There, Pound Pound Pound, Burn Down the Night, Telegraph Your Love, Operator, Dance Electric, and Baby Come And Get It. The bonuses of this collection icclude commentary from each of the Pointer Sisters, plus the extended 12"" versions of their dance songs, such as Neutron Dance, Automatic, Jump, Dare Me, I'm So Excited, and Goldmine.I would instantly recommend this collection of hits to anyone who likes classic eighties, classic Country, R&B;, Soul, Rock, Pop, Gospel or Techno Pop. I absolutely believe this compilation is the best yet!!!"
3,Good Vocals but Cliche Material,the Pointer Sisters are really good Singers but because they have done some of the most Cliched Material from the Synth&Programmed 80's it's cost them there due as Good Vocalists I believe.they have songs that everybody remembers or likes but rarely will go around bragging about.they were a Formula driven Group which fit in really well in the Mid-80's&change but it's hard them in the long run&it shouldn't.
4,Cross cultural linege in splendid form.,"I was introduced to Vassanji while I was in my final year at university. He was being explored in Indian authors writing in english.Vassanji is a fantastic story teller, his prose is smooth and imbued with myth and the intricate patterns of the narrators lineage.The very title "" gunny sack"" promised much hertitage as it means a sack used for travelling. The author finds this and it is a metaphor for the discovery of his familial hertitage as he traces his ancestry from India to Africa.This book is great especially if you are of indian hertitage and have been displaced from your original homeland."
1,UGLY,"The cheerleader looks deformed, her head is too tiny and her arms are so skinny that there is no way to make cookies with it. I asked for a refund from a cheap item but they wanted me to mail it back. It is so ugly that it sin't even a novelty item and could never make cookies."
4,A great introduction to how the fuel cell evolved,"Founder Geoff Ballard lived by the words ""Dare to be in a hurry to change things for the better."" Powering the Future is a story about Geoff Ballard and a small team of people that stuck together and pioneered PEM fuel cell technology. Ballard, the company, does not endorse the book because of the bad blood that existed between the new leadership and the old guard. It's hard to say who was right but the survival of the fuel cell required partnering with companies like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor Company. It also required a lot of PR talent that the the founder did not have. The book has an excellent overview of how a fuel cell works. Once you read it you will learn how fuel cells work and how the hydrogen economy can one day transform the world. Ballard, the company, continues to have awesome potential and a lot of talented people working there. I know because I work there too."
5,DADA's Duchamp,"Finding myself writing an art exam and short of information on the art movement Dada and works of Marcel Duchamp, I resorted to the local library where I found this amazing book on just that. The book takes the reader through Duchamp's Futurist days to where he ended, one of the greatest contempory artist's of the 21st century. The colour photographs are amazing, and it is visually as well as intellectually stimulating."
4,Blaxploitation meets Sci-Fi,"This movie is the pinnacle of Blaxploitation films. The lead character is a black man who is wrongfully imprisoned and then cruelly experimented on in jail. When he gets out, he has a unique Pinnochio-esque talent. But, it's not his nose that grows...think lower and longer (ha, ha). I could not stop laughing as he killed his enemies with his ""secret weapon"". This movie is not meant to be taken serious, but it accomplishes something the other Blaxploitation films of this time did not...a truly unique storyline."
3,Good blaxploitation flix Not one for the kids,"Brutally beaten and arrested on false charges, Charlie has done his time and now he's out...for revenge. Standard blaxploitation fare made legendary by a scene involving Charlie's murderous member.IF YOU SHOULD ENJOY SUCH THINGS IN LIFE AS THE SIGHT OF SOMEONE BEING STRANGLED BY A 30 FOOT [...], THEN THIS SLICE OF BLAXPLOITATION IS FOR YOU. THIS MOVIE WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED UNDER THE TITLE 'WELCOME HOME, BROTHER CHARLES',BUT THIS INCARNATION AS 'SOUL VENGEANCE',IM PLEASED TO SAY, REMAINS UNCUT AND RUNS FOR 98MINS (NOT 87 AS STATED ON THE BOX). AT SUCH A CHEAP PRICE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG."
5,great purchase,I love this film it gave me what i was looking brought back the times i admired these guys. Loved the fashion and music.thank you very much best wishes Merry Christmas happy new 2013 x
3,Only one good part of the movie,"I love to watch old blaxpoitation films, but this one was not as interesting as the description made it sound. I had to fight myself to remain interested during the first 40 minutes, but things picked up in the second half. The only worthwhile part of the movie is when the main character kills someone with his penis."
1,Don't Wast Your Time...,"Don't believe the hype! This film is boring and dull as dirt. I love films of this period/genre, but this one has no redeeming value. If you're simply waiting to see the infamous ""prop"" -- you're in for a disappointment: it appears (only once!) during the final five minutes of the film, and even then it's non-eventful and (excuse the pun) anti-climactic. The story is poorly conceived, written and executed, and overall the film brings nothing new or fresh to the table for this type of film. Trust me, you've seen it all before in much better films of the period. This dull and dated dud isn't worth your time -- avoid it at all costs! Check out the director's under-rated and almost ignored gem, ""Black Sister's Revenge"" instead -- it'll surprise you."
4,the Premier Treatise on This Subject,The first serious look at the attempts by humans to communicate with dolphins. Lilly breaks new ground with his coverage of expirements to date.Most work in this field has been only written up before in classified military projects. Reluctantly I had passed my copy on to a student majoring in marine biology.This review is written from memory as I came here seeking to buy another copy. I liked it enough to buy it twice. My recommendation that you buy it once is happily tendered.
5,thought-provoking,"I was introduced to this text in a seminary class on Biblical theology and found Fretheim's discussion challenging and provocative. Fretheim demonstrates that the notion of a omniscient,omnipotent God simply is not borne out in the biblical narrative. Rather, we have a portrayal of God as one in a loving relationship with God's people. A loving relationship, by its very nature, implies give-and-take and no one party is allowed control or dominance. Fretheim demonstrates example after example in the scriptures where God is portrayed as influenced, persuaded, surprised,and even confused by the behavior of the people. This is a God who suffers when the people suffer, not a God who is above all and beyond human experience. I have had the privilege to hear Dr. Fretheim speak in person and he is an engaging and challenging theologian with much to offer both the professional student and the arm chair theologian."
5,Expands your Perspective on God,"This is a wonderful book that explores how God relates to the world. It focuses on issues and passages that are almost always skipped over by preachers and scholars. So prepare to be shocked. I've the entire OT several times, but I guess I didn't realize what I was reading or read over it too quickly. For examples, he lists several passages where it talks about God crying. Amazing!"
1,Disappointed with the movies included on the DVD,Majority of the movies on the DVD were silent movies made by Laurel & Hardy. That was not stated in the description of this DVD.
2,Laurel or Hardy,"I thought that this was a good collection to summarize the Laurel & Hardy works in short movies, however there is just two works of both of them together in this compilation (the movie Utopia and Flying Deuces).Almost of the material that you'll find here is previous works of them as solo and not as a couple. In fact you'll find a short even without music.If you want to enjoy there work as a duet this is not for you."
2,Too many remote shorts,"I wanted movies with them together. Many of these films don't have them as actors, but they may have directed it or they are in the films individually. Boo... very disappointed!"
2,dvd,"dvd remastered fairly, as expected. Delivery on the other hand was poor. I even forgot I ordered it before Christmas (received a month later)"
1,Laurel & Hardy Vol. 1,Item only contained very poor films by L 7 H or Laurel or Haardy alone with other actors.A great rilp-off. jsp
2,Awful collection - most of these aren't even Laurel & Hardy films,"Do yourself a big favor. Unless you are a DIE-HARD fan who feels the necessity to own EVERYTHING STan LAurel and Oliver Hardy ever mad, DO NOT BUY THIS. What an awful collection. Stick with the Hal Roach Studio comedies they made from 1927-35. Those are their quality work. Everything else is disappointing if not downright awful."
1,Rip off combo of lame Laurel and Hardy stuff mostly Silent!!,Not worth more than 5 bucks. They don't make it clear but there are at least 75% silent films here are bad ones at that. There's nothing else to say after that. Don't buy this one. You'll just get pissed.
4,Classic Laurel & Hardy DVD,"This is a fun video for anybody interested in the origins of film comedy, or for anybody just interested in spending some time laughing at the vintage antics of this comedy duo. Laurel & Hardy are the prototype for all comedy teams, from Burns & Allen to Rowan & Martin. Several of the ""two-reelers"" on this DVD are silent, but they demonstrate the great physical comedy routines that make L & H great."
4,Classic Comedy,"If you like Three Stooges, Little Rascals, or comedy from the black&white screen days, Laurel&Hardy is for you. Madcap situations with slapstick comedy that is still used in modern times was originated by the people I just mentioned. Classic comedy at it's FINEST."
3,"meh, not the best book I've read","not the best book, period.It had its moments though...it reminds me of several classic original series episodes...such as the Naked Time to name a favoriteI can't quite put my finger on it, but even though the premise was cool, the writing just wasn't all that great.Simply average."
2,Skip this one,"This is the type of book that gives 'tie-in' novels a bad name. The premise of the story, Enterprise protecting archeologists and previously undiscovered ancient civilization against hostile forces, is good. It has certainly been used elsewhere in the Star Trek universe to much better effect. The characterizations of the main characters is 'off', even allowing for the fact that they are under the influence of an outside force. The execution of the novel is just plan sloppy, there are huge gaps in the action that left this reader wondering just what the heck was going on.Unless you are oppessive-compulsive and just HAVE to read them all give this one a miss, there are plenty of other, much better, entries in the series."
3,Average Star Trek Book,"This book has a little of the STTOS episode, ""Naked Time"", and a ST:TNG episode with a Picard archeological story thrown in. The storyline stays on track. There is no real character development because everyone is under some kind of mental influences and acting out of the ordinary. Kirk is to pacifist - McCoy hates machines -Scotty wants the ideal top-notch engines. So, there is not the character developments and relationships we usually see in the ST Universe. But, I liked that unusual differences. Who else is acting differently? Read and find out! Some of the new on-board ship characters I didn't like. The aliens are the Andorians and Klingons. What will they do? The Andorians are not the military aggressors as shown in a recent ""Enterprise"" TV episode.Read on..."
2,A weaker Classic Trek novel effort.,"In my reviews of Classic Star Trek novels, it must be understood that I adhere to the original canonas invisioned by Gene Roddenberry, and not the ""Star Trek"" universe accepted by Rick Berman and company.I generally rate a classic novel thus:Adherence to Canon -- does this novel adhere to the vision of the original Star Trek?3 starsBelievability (within the confines of 23rd century Star Trek viability) -- is this novel well-plotted and wellwritten? Can I picture this novel or imagine myself in it?2 starsCoherence and Consistency -- does this novel internally consistent? Is it consistent with other Star Treknovels by the same author? Is it consistent with what is known of the CLASSIC Star Trek universe?4 stars -- consistent with the author's ""Mutiny on the Enterprise""Mitigating Factors -- pluses or minuses which dramatically affect the enjoyment of this bookMinus one star for very poor ending."
2,To Trekkies it's important to be orthodox,"Trekkies demand orthodoxy. New intpretations or ignoring the generally held view of how characters are supposed to act is really bad. Spock is real, McCoy is real. Therefore you have to stick to what is ""normal"" for them. Also Klingons are more complex than this book presents. They are warlike but they don't go solely on bloodlust. Give more of a reason for Klingons to act. This author did a better job in his other book, Mutiny on the Enterprise.Sinners repent."
3,Like it,"This is an interesting and at times enthralling read, this said I wasn't able to become as absorbed as I was with the Alexander series. Manfredi is an excellent descriptive writer of historically referenced or based novels. I recommend him to enthusiastic readers of this genre."
2,Boring,Maybe I've read too many racy thrillers but I found the story totally pedestrian and unexciting. A simple tale of revenge was dressed up with a lot of mystical elements and historical bits thrown in to complicate the plot. This is the first book I've read from the author and perhaps his historical epics are more impressive but I'm not motivated enough to find out from reading this book.
3,If you can get passed the bad looks.,"If you can find someway around the bad look of this CD player then I'd suggest buying it. However I could not get passed the bad looks, and have returned it to the store at which I purchased it."
5,INCREDIBLE PIECE OF MUSIC,"This is one of the top albums on the market today, and the sould put into the music is remarkable. This album can be listened to multiple times and appreciated each and every time. Anyone who likes music should check out this album."
3,"Fun music, but not very original","I realize I'm giving this three stars and everyone else has given it five. You'll have to decide for yourself, but I think my score is more justified. Pepper is a fun band with a classic ""feel-good"" ska/reggae/punk sound ... like Sublime as others have noted. But if you are, or where, a Sublime fan you will ultimately find Pepper disappointing. Not because they are bad, in fact they are pretty fun, but because they never get beyond ""fun."" Sublime had a certain edge (mostly misogynistic), and unpredictability that Pepper lacks. Maybe with time they'll move past repetitive imitation and find something that makes them unique and interesting. I imagine there ought to be something unique about living and working in Kona?Don't take all this as a negative review. As long as you don't expect too much (and who really expects a CD to change their life?), Pepper is a good listen. I recommend you try it if you enjoy Sublime and need something new to listen to."
2,Barley dude,"Really, just barely. The music is nice but the lyrics fall way short of 3 to 5 stars so, I guess teens are pumping this disk up for the lewd,naked band boy, pictured on the inside of the jacket AND on the disc. I find it offensive and feel volcom entertainment should not have allowed this. The lyrics are the teenage fantasies and adolescent behavior of some wild, sex-crazed kids. I give this yuck 2stars and the band 3stars for having to put up with this stuff everytime they perform.Barely,dude! Not one hit on the disc."
5,Highly addictive,"This game from Japan is highly addictive for any player. You don't have to good at rhythm games to play this either.You go through many addictive songs to encourage people on the street to do their best, whether it's a student trying to pass an exam or going back in time to encourage Cleopatra to lose weight.You can start off with easy or normal mode, but the higher the mode is, the more beats you'll have to match up with. But no matter what, this game will leave you humming the songs for hours afterwards. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes rhythm games, or likes watching them!"
3,Brief Look into Historic Embroidery,"I bought this and ""Buttons and Trimmings"" of the same series on super-sale at the Met and I have to say that I would not pay full price for them. They are lovely, but they are small (note the dimensions before you buy) and are not very information-dense and I have seen some of the items featured on a larger, more approachable scale in other books. I recommend looking at the ""Fashion in Detail"" books published by the V & A before you purchase these. Still, the Snowshill collection is one of the best in the world, and these books offer the only specific look at it (ideally, the manor would publish a full-scale book on its collected pieces). There are unique, interesting pieces and work featured here (I was particularly taken by a set of late 18th c. silkwork garters) and scathing as I can be of them, I will probably end up buying the others in the series."
5,Compaq aero 2110,"It's a good pocket pc. It haves many good things like games,color tft 3"" screen. I have it too i love it.The Compaq aero 2110 is nice and thin it has my new things to explore. ..."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"Its advertised as Antibacterial Hand Soap, even says so in the picture of the product. When this handsoap arrived, no where on the package does it say antibacterial handsoap. This is very misleading. And I paid a good price, thinking I finally found an antibacterial hand soap that is not orange color. DONT FALL FOR THE TRAP LIKE I DID."
4,A Very Good Study Bible Overall,"The HarperCollins Study Bible is one of the best study bibles for students and scholars of biblical criticism. Its best feature is the complete Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books, a must for serious, historical Old Testament studies. On the down side, it lacks an extensive reading guide found in the Catholic Study Bible: New American Bible for gaining a better historical perspective on all books of the bible. Still, the New Revised Standard Version Translation, introductions and footnotes are easy to grasp and understand. This study bible is recommended mainly for those in serious critical bible study, rather than the mainstream Christian."
3,The Harper Collins Study Bible,"Since I recently relocated to the buckle of the Bible Belt, I decided it's about time to actually read the good book, cover to cover. I was also interested to learn more about the Apochrypha, books which are not included in the Protestant Bible I was given as a teen. A retired liberal pastor recommended this particular study bible to me. I appreciate that it's very scholarly, though at times I find the notes overly detailed for my needs. At least, the authors are not biased in their interpretations and present the facts as understood by current research."
4,For the Serious ecumencial seeker,"If you are a serious seeker or a first year theology student, this bible is ideal for those needing a fuller picture of language and background. From Jewish scholars to Christian theologians, the books are introduced for much needed perspective on the implications for the audience. Rather than detract from faith, this study bible enriches the journey with a medium-sized type face that is easy on the eyes for those late night study sessions.If you are looking for a bible to wrestle with the word of God, this study bible can stimulate the beginning of a beautiful journey."
4,Recommended study Bible but....,"I'd give this superb study Bible 5 stars (I almost gave it 3 stars under the circumstances..) if the publisher had the decency to sew the pages rather than merely glue 'em in! This type of binding (ironically called ""perfect binding"" in the bookbinding trade) is certainly not durable and will not open flat without probable risk of splitting the spine. It is quite sad that American bookbinding has come to this point, i.e., sacrificing quality for quantity. Anyhow, this Bible is wonderful regarding content, etc but count on having to replace it after a few years of hard use."
5,A Great Reference Bible for Research,"The NRSV translation is a great translation. The notes throughout the text are written by biblical scholars, which makes the text very trustworthy. I should note that this Bible is not for devotional needs, but for reference. If you want a good reference Bible then this is the Bible for you."
