5,A Voice For The Masses,"My Dear Crystal!! She has touched on an area that has proven to very sensitive for a lot of women, especially black women. I think that because so many of us can identify with a piece of this book, it's all the more real, true, and attainable!! Crystal has shown us through her example that we can all achieve our weight loss goals and that's wonderful! A blessing, in fact and I applaud her for her success!! Bravo!!! and ENCORE!!!Dhiadra R. Fullman"
2,2000 pages or 800 pages?,"Amazon completely fails to distinguish between the magnificent original of 2000 pages, with 1200 pages of subject (word, phrase) index alone, and the subsequent emasculation by Avenel, Random House, et al, with the invaluable Index expunged. The many copies offered by Amazon all appear to be abridgements, altho none states so, these beginning in 1978 by Avenel, of the 1968 original, which was by far the best of its kind on the market, but only because of the superlative Index. The original was published by Delacorte, and none of its owners appear willing to part with it for any price. The abridgements, sans index, are no bargain, even at 79 cents!"
1,Wouldnt work,"I tried using 5 or 6 devices to see if I could get it to work, xboxes, ps3, dvd player, blu ray. Nothing but a high powered pc made this work for some reason...The movie itself was basically porn so I just turned it off. It wasnt bad good like samurai cop, but it was just bad period. Disappointed"
3,"Not the best suction, but still lots of fun!","We agree with other reviews that the suction cup is not so great- but our daughter still has a great time with this. I get about 5 minutes in where the suction stays put and she just loves it. It's enough time for me to make some food up, or do something. I just re-attach it and she's good to go again. She also likes it as a floor toy- it has a great clicking sound and she loves the bee. As long as you don't have any high expectations for the suction cup on this one- it's a nice little toy."
2,don't waste your money,"I had high hopes for this toy to entertain my 9 month old in his highchair or on the stroller. While it is a cute and fun toy for him to play with, the suction doesn't work well. My son was able to remove it immediately with normal play. I have to actually hold it up for him to play with it. It is a bummer because he really likes it.....when it is standing up."
1,This album stinks,Got this album and I was like what is this? This album stinks from begining to end and jizzy pearl cant sing at all on this cd. Saw them live in concert with him dont know why and it was the worst show I have ever been to he sounded even worse in concert sorry but jizzy just did not fit the band and in no way could ever replace phil. I am glad jizzy was only on one album he just didnt fit la guns style and yes the sound on this album was very poor. Thanks that phil is back now and the la guns sound like the la guns. And those people who said this album was good um what were you listing too? No longer have this album and I can see why most places dont carry it anymore as it hardly sold any copies when it came out.
4,this is a great album with great songs,"this is the best l.a. guns record in a long time. my favorite part of the record is jizzy pearl ex-love/hate vocalist. he gives the guns a dimension they never got a chance to explore before. he gives them that nasty junkyard dog feeling with his singing. i like vintage l.a. guns too with the old vocalist(s) but really, kingjizzo is a hardcore singer and in a world today with the sugar rays and all the other pretty singing groups, jizz complements the playing of traci guns great. traci puts on another great performance.please support the local independent musicians by purchasing records and promoting them by telling a friend, etc. so buy this album, girls and boys."
3,best of the Phil-less albums,"If ever an album needed a remaster, this is it. Tight musicianship and strong song writing is let down by poor production which leaves the whole album sounding cloudy. Having said that, this is a better release than American Hardcore, and Jizzy is a better replacement for Phil than Chris was. In hindsight, seeings Phil would return to the band, it probebly would have been better if the Phil-less L.A. Guns albums had been released as Tracii Guns projects, I reckon. As for the artwork, surely, even on a tight budget, they could have come up with something better than they did, pretty woeful. At the end of the day, this release isn't a bad effort, though getting Phil back for Man in the Moon and Waking the Dead(arguably their best album) was definatly the right move."
3,Shrinking Violet... OK,"I only listened to this one a few times and lent it out (I have yet to get it back) so I can not say if it will grow on me or not. However early indications left me with the feeling that this was an average album, sure Tracii is the man for guitars yet many of the songs seem to me a little too average with the exceptions of tracks like Shrinking Violet and Dreamtime. Much of the album seems to sound heavy in an old fashion sort of way which is a good thing. Jizzy Pearl's vocals and the rawness of the production are more akin to the first L.A.Guns release than that of American Hardcore or Wasted with Ralph.The first two classic line up reunion albums should in my opinion have been recorded in either this vain or that of the third album yet the content of this album in general is to me a bit bland.Listen to it see what you think perhaps its just me."
5,Best L.A. Guns Album You Never Heard,"If all you've heard of LA Guns is their first 2 albums, you're missing out. This 1999 release is my favorite l.a.g. album. Ex-Love/Hate vocalist Jizzy Pearl does the vocals (Check out Blackout In The Red Room by Love/Hate). This CD's been in my truck's cd player for a while now. I can't take it out! Get it! Tracii needs a new guitar! Ha (That would make an even 1000). Take Me Back To California!"
2,"Without Phil, its just not L.A.Guns","If your an L.A.Guns fan like I am then you would be just as dissapointed as I was when I recieved this album. Without Phil there is no L.A.Guns wether you'd like to admitt it or not. In this album they tried to revert back to the days of there Self-Titled debut and leave the Heavy Metal scene that they tried on the American Hardcore album, but without Phil it just didnt work. Jizzy Pearl and the rest of the band were off-sync and the sound production was horrible, it sounded like they just recorded a few demos and crammed it into the album without any mixing or anything. I only recommend this album if your a true L.A.Guns fan like I am."
3,Re-issue is a joke,The original release of Shrinking Violet is better since it has more studio songs. The re-issuie is missing the Zep cover How Many More Times.
1,"mediocre ""smooth jazz""","This is a mediocre (at best) smooth jazz rendition of 14 holiday classics. I could not even listen to it once. I heard half a minute or so of each track, heard that it was more of the same bland smooth sax and electric piano, and hit skip until I got to the end. Then I took it out of my CD player and promptly got rid of it. Even if you like Christmas music, don't bother."
3,Not what I expected,It was a bit more raged and looked like it had been pre-washed and faded. I was just expecting something a bit nicer for the price. It did arrive on promptly though.
3,Disappointed.,This toy does not play a whole song and repeats the same portion of a song each time. It also arrived with dead batteries - luckily I scramble to get new ones the day before my child's birthday. Much better for very young kids - 18-24 months.
3,Singing Pablo,"I was a little embarrassed giving this as a gift for Christmas. It had a dusty look about it, as if it was a hand me down. I haven't heard anything from the child's parents since Christmas, so I assume there have been no problems and their son is enjoying it."
2,Wrong fabric,No me gusto el material de que esta hecho pues se le hacen bolitas de pelusa y se ve como si tuviera mucho tiempo de usado. Definitivamente no lo recomendaria aparte lo que dice Pablo cuando lo aprietas no es una de las frases que yo escogeria para un juguete tan popular.
2,Baby didn't like it,I know of a lot of people who own and like this carrier but my baby hated it!! She cried evertime I put her in it. I got a Hotsling instead and she is very happy in it.
4,Great product...,This is a great carrier as long as you read the instructions and make sure to adjust it correctly. It is easy to get on and off and it is easy to get baby in and out. I'm glad I saved my money and went with this carrier. I also like that it can be used as a back pack carrier when baby is older.
3,Did not work for me,"I tried and tried to use this product, but it just didn't work for me. I tried many different adjustments and it still wasn't what I needed in back support. A positive of the product was getting the baby in and out-- it was very easy, one of the easiest on the market. Another thing I did not like about this carrier is when my son fell asleep in it his head would lean to the side and the head supposrt strap is not padded so his poor little head is leaning against this bare strap. He never cried over it, but it just looked so uncomfortable to me. I took this back and purchased a more expensive one from another brand name which offered thicked straps, more padded straps, and better back support for me. My husband didn't have a problem with this carrier. I believe it hit him in the right places better than it did on me and his back is stronger than mine."
4,Love It!!,"I love this Snuggli. I use it about everyday. My daughter is now 3 months, and she absolutely loves it. I find that it is the most useful when I go to the grocery store, or Target -- some place that I have a cart and can but the diaper bag in it. My daughter just falls asleep. I think it is very comfortable. The only negative is that is has a lot of straps; I did not want to use it at first because I felt that it was such a hastle, but I have gotten used to it, and now love it."
5,This carrier is a lifesaver!!,"I have loved this carrier since the first time I used it. It is so convenient when my baby is being fussy and wants to be held all the time. I use it when cleaning the house, shopping, and anything else I can think of. The price is very reasonable for the product you receive. The only problem I have is that it is not very easy to put this on and get baby in by yourself. It can be done though. Overall I am very happy with this carrier and definately would not purchase the more expensive product if I had to do it all over again."
2,uncomfortable carrier,"We tried a bunch of these carriers, not wanting to spend a lot on a baby bjorn, but ended up returning all of them. This one was cumbersome to put on and get baby in and out. I also found it uncomfortable. The baby bjorn is expensive, but has been well worth it. I wish I just purchased it from the start."
5,Best Money Spent!!!,"This carrier is absolutely fabulous! I can't imagine trying to get anything done without this carrier. It is a bit daunting the first time you use it, but once you figure out where all the straps connect, it's a breeze to adjust by yourself. It allows for the baby to be comfortable awake or asleep! And the side buckles are easy to manuver, especially after you've done it once or twice. I take my son everywhere in this carrier and with it being so well priced, this has become my favorite baby shower gift!!!"
4,"Good Buy, Great Product.","This backpack may seem hard to figure out at first, but once you put it on, and adjust all the straps, you will realize that the amount of straps it has, are very useful in providing comfort for you and your baby. The multiple positions available to put your baby in are also accomodating for the specific outing you are going to use it for, and/or the age of your baby when you use it."
2,Stylish But...,"Bought this elsewhere and am now browsing for alternatives. Was looking for the next step up from my soft newborn carrier. This one seemed very sturdy and stylish, and the color was great for one who hates all of the cutesy and/or navy blue baby stuff from which we are normally forced to choose. However, I was heartbroken to find it tough to use with my six month old - hard to believe that she would already be too big to make doing up the side closures practical, but that seemed to be the case (despite what Snugli's specs claimed), so hated to waste the money. I'm thinking of getting someone to custom design me one!"
5,absolutely LOVE IT,"easy to use,comfortable.I would recommend it to others,and would purchase again.when my daughter gets fussy i strap her on my back or chest.""she loves it"""
2,Baby hates it,"We got this from our friends who swear it works fine and is a lot cheaper than the baby bjorn. Well my son hated it! He just didn't sit right in it, facing in or out. We finally spurlged for the Nicole Miller one, and it is sooo much better. And is better looking. The snugli is so complicated to use. Trust me, the baby bjorn or Nicole Miller are worth the money."
5,"Love this, Love this, Love this!!!","What else can I say? From day one it has helped put my son to sleep if he was fussing, allowed me to go shopping since it kept him close to me and made him feel comforted, and is just basically useful. An absolute must for your infant and/or a perfect shower gift. The new mother will be thanking you!"
3,You gotta have patience,"The Snugli works, you just have to have patience...which I don't have a lot of. If you are the only one using it, you can customize it to your size and it's easy to use after that; however, my husband and I both wanted to use it and having to readjust all the straps is a pain in the neck. There are so many straps! It's hard to figure out where they all go unless you've done it 10 or so times. I looked at the Baby Bjorn and it seems to be easier, but it is three times more expensive. I've looked at trying a sling instead. The Snugli is not terrible. If you can figure it out the baby seems to like it. When our son was a newborn, though, he would sink down into our chest and we'd have to hold the side of the Snugli down for him to breathe. However, now that we can turn him around and he's facing outward he really does like it a lot and it's a great idea. Just not for impatient people like me."
5,Good Investment,"I am very happy with this baby sling. It's a little intimidating at first because of all the straps, and I had to have my husband help me adjust it to fit. But all the straps make for a very secure fit.My newborn is very comfortable in this sling. She gets to lay close to me. We tested this out by going to the mall. The whole time baby slept comfortably and not once did my back start hurting. I was very comfortable the entire time and both baby and I felt secure.For me the sling is less trouble than a stroller at this point and has been a nice option.I would recommend this sling. Just be sure to have someone help the first time adjusting it to your body."
2,Go with the Better Brand!!,"I registered for the this carrier because I didn't want to ask for the expensive Baby Bjorn carrier but I wish I had asked for that one. This carrier is not easy to minipulate and put on there are far too many buckles and straps. The material is very scratchy and every time I have attempted to put my baby in it he got upset and was very uncomfortable. My sister who has a Baby Bjorn uses it every day. Her baby loves it and is very comfortable because it's made out of soft material, it doesn't have a bunch of straps dangling around, and it is so simple to use. If I could go back I would have registered for the baby bjorn instead of the cumbersome Snugli."
3,Backpack part...not so great.,"This snugli is a very useful product. But, we were never able to use the back pack part of the carrier. Our son did not seem comfortable and it wasn't comfortable for those carrying him either. Save the $10 and buy the standard front carrier snugli."
3,Couldn't use it for infant.,"I am kind of short and I could not get this thing adjusted to a comfortable position for my son as a small baby. I'm getting ready to try to use it again with him facing outward. I also feel it is difficult to use without someone's help. I hear the Baby Bjorn one is very good, though it is more expensive."
3,Could be ok,"My main problem is this: If you put the carrier on according to the instructions, the ""waist belt"" makes the carrier WAY too high, at least on my relatively short torso. Now, if you put it down on your hips, it fits ok, but I had a c-section, and I can't do that yet.Other than that, it seems ok. I guess we'll see how it works when I'm all healed up."
1,Great product - if you like screaming!,"Whoever ""designed"" this product, in their infinite wisdom, didn't include a width adjustment for the baby. My 15 pound baby is compressed horribly when we try to get him in the carrier. Now he merely has to see it to begin screaming hysterically.Thanks, Snugli."
2,You get what you pay for,"I really did not like this carrier, my son didn't either. I decided to get the Bjorn and we both love it. My husband even likes to carry him around in it =)"
1,This pack is horrible,"This pack takes 10-15 minutes to put on. Who has 10-15 minutes when you're getting out of the car to go shopping, or whatever? This is not an ideal carrier at all. The previous Snugli design was much better, more comfortable, and easier to work with."
3,"Good Music, But...","The song list for the record shows alot of Willie's old tunes, and I was looking for the tune ""I Just Can't Let You Say Goodbye"" in particular. I was under the impression the CD was a collection of recordings from the era, but a listen revealed that they must have been rerecorded at some later (probably the 1990s) time. The photo of Willie on the album jacket was, in hindsight, a giveaway. The songs are decent, but Willie's vocal range at the time of the recordings is just not up to where it was when these songs were new, and I wanted the originals. I wish the recentness of the recordings was highlighted more prominently in the sales literature here. Some of the songs are hard to find now on CD, so I would probably still buy it now, but I would have wanted to know upfront about the rerecordings."
3,CTK496 mini organ package,"Found one key has additional ""click"" tone which bothers me.The AC adapter although is new, but the adapter cover came out because of poor material - I just taped it back. The whole package came in nicely packed & overall it's light in weight unexpectedly.Casio CTK700 Keyboard with Power Supply, Stand and Akai Digital Chord Finder"
5,Very slimline design,"Shipped timely and looks fantastic with the Promag barrel band setup. However, the telescoping legs are spring loaded so you can't adjust them. its either in or out. I have a feeling they won't hold up in a survival situation for the long haul, but sitting on my coffee table the whole setup is way sexy."
3,review,"I'll keep it short. As a bipod alone it is effective; however, there are some aspects of it that are not ideal. The most important in my mind, if you plan on putting a sling onto your firearm it can be done; but not comfortably. The stand digs into your back sharply when using a sling. This is due to the fact that when the legs are retracted (facing forward in the carry position) there are sharp points that appear which can cut you if wearing a t-shirt or cut your jacket when carrying your gun with a sling. The other aspects of the product which are not ideal are minor. There is no grip on the feet of the bipod, in fact the feet have sharp edges that when placed against wood can scratch the wood, or when placed upon cloth can snag it. Moreover, the springs in the extension portion of each leg are quite stiff making setting the height the same on both legs more difficult than necessary."
4,Does what I need it to so far,Swivel action work ok. Easy to attach and unattach. Extends out very little compared to a harris. But a lot less money. So you get what you pay for.
1,Buyer Beware,"Leapers has a no-refund policy, which I can confirm from firsthand experience (I am still out $68 for a product which I paid to ship back and which they have in their possession). They sell equipment under both the Leapers and the UTG brand name. Both lines are made in China and BOTH are of airsoft or paintball quality. Do not use either for for real weapons that have any actual recoil, or you will be picking pieces up off the ground. If it was a U.S. company, it would be sued for falsely using the words ""tactical"" and ""mil-spec"" in any of their product descriptions."
1,they don't carry this product anymore,Airsplat does not carry this product. They sent me something else and I have do ship it back to them. They claimed Leapers doesn't make this model anymore. Contact Airsplat before ordering.
1,UTG - MADE IN CHINA!,"Garbage! UTG bipods are manufactured to the lowest standards! These have no business being mounted on a weapon, perhaps an airsoft gun or BB gun. These bipods are manufactured in CHINA and their customer service is routed through CHINA as well! UTG bipods utilize cheap hardware and consequently torque under minimal stress. The bipod I received twists about the yaw axis when simply folding and unfolding the bipod's spring assisted legs. I called the customer service number provided on the packaging and my call was routed to CHINA!!! The customer service representative ""CSR"" spoke broken English and was unable to resolve my issue, at the end of my call this ""CSR"" directed me to their website...Don't purchase this bipod!!! You will be disappointed!"
2,About what you'd expect for the price,"Bought this as a value-appropriate solution for a S&W; 15-22. However, the reality of its lack of stoutness is not even suitable as legs for a .22LR, at least one that anyone plans on shooting. Way too much play at the leg pivot points makes for a surprisingly unstable sighting platform even on the most stable ground/bench surface, plus the thing rattles too much for its own good. The collar-type leg locks get fouled up too easily with dirt, the aluminum construction--though nice in its lightness--damages far too easily, and the overall fit and finish seems marginal even with the price factored in. The one good thing is that its legs extend long enough to allow clearance for a full-sized magazine, but that's about it. Frankly, this bipod's probably best for a static display piece rather than for any sort of field or even indoor range work.Guess going cheap wasn't the best choice for a quality shooting experience. Live and learn (sigh)."
5,Yes!,"Search youtube for Nutnfancy and this bipod. Shouldn't hesitate to buy! Worth every penny, functions great on my Ruger 10/22. Also has held up to an AR, no need to buy heavy overpriced alternatives. Buy it!"
4,Pretty nice for 25 bucks,"I like this bipod alot. It deploys easy and is made of pretty strong metal. The legs are aluminum and I think the feet and inner legs are steel. It looks good and comes with a swivel stud to picatinny adapter for mounting on a wood or synthetic rifle stock. I have it on my M&P; 15 right now and will be swapping between my Remington 597. They say not to buy UTG because its for toys and airsoft. But, this thing is pretty solid and most people put their airsoft guns through more hell than I put my real guns through anyway.I marked down one star because you have to tighten the inner bolt REALLY TIGHT with loctite to get it to stop swiveling."
3,Had to do a little filing,The part that goes over the sling stud needed to be filed to fit right. And the springs on the extenders are a little to stiff. They are more like little pogo sticks. Other than all of that they look like they will work ok.
4,good for practice and target shooting,"This bipod is perfect for target shooting and going out to the range. I attached it to my ar15 and it stood up against about 1000 rounds in a day. I wouldn't use it for active duty b/c it lacks some of the quality that more expensive bipods have, but overall I am very pleased. Easy set up, durable, and very reasonable price."
4,"Works Well, Good Value - Recommended","This UTG Bipod is a good quality accessory and provides decent stability on my heavy barrel varmint rifle. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Physical Quality; all metal construction+ Height; adjusts from 9"" to 11"", which is high enough to accommodate a 30-rd magazine+ Versatility; can connect to a Picatinny rail or a swivel stud mount (my varmint rifle already has a Picatinny rail and I'm using the included adapter to add one to another rifle)Cons -- A little more ""play"" than expected when mounted, but nothing too egregiousOverall, this is a very good value for a good quality bipod.Recommended!CFH"
4,Pretty Good Product.,I got this Bi-Pod for my AR-15 for the gas block.It works great but I had to put a little loktite on the screw so it wont come loose.The only reason I gave it 4 Stars instead of 5 stars is because the feet wont change position.
4,Excellent bi-pod for the price,"Excellent, simple bi-pod for the price. The legs take a little getting used to, but for the price, a good choice."
5,Wow,"I am really surprised on how good the quality of this bipod is....Very sturdy and strong aluminum structure. It came with the swivel piece and you it can mount on the picatiny rail too. Adjustable height, no issues, looks like it is going to be a lot of fun shooting with this bipod. I am still surprised on the built quality! Awesome buy, for an awesome price.Thanks!"
5,great for price,this is not the best bipod in the world but in its price range i think it is.i have a fully custom mosin nagant i put it on.it works good looks good only bad thing is is fits just a little bit loose but thats part my stock.overall very happy will buy for my ak as long as price says down
4,Awesome for the price!,"This is a great product for the price. I use this on my Arsenal AK-47 SGL-21. I have it mounted on theUTG Deluxe Tri-Rail Barrel Mount, it gets a bit tricky if you are trying to get a precise length when you extend the legs out because of the spring inside, but this will clear an AK with a 30 round mag. Overall, this is great item!"
4,Far Beyond My Expectations,"Had this printer for a month, and it's a gem.PROS:Print quality is excellent, with vivid colors. With dual paper feeds, you are always ready. Duplex printing is an added bonus if you are pirnting two-sided documents. I was ready to purchase a printer with an optional duplexing unit. No need with this model. Built in document feeder is great if you are copying or scanning multiple pages. Separate color cartridges saves money.CONS:Much larger and heavier printer requiring a very sturdy stand.Installation documentation could be much more clearer.Two hours to setup, install cartridges and software. I've installed many printers so I was surprised that this one was the most time consuming (print head, 5 print cartridges, tons of wrapping). But it's well worth the effort. You won't be disappointed."
4,Canon PIXMA MP750 All-in-One Photo Printer,"I am not a techie and so far this machine has done all of the things I have asked it to with no back-talk. We have printed, copied single-copies, copied front-and-back, copied multiple copies. I've done a simple printing of a photo on regular paper. One of these days I'll work up to real photo work and I have every confidence that this machine will support my efforts. I am eternally grateful for this cooperation."
4,Hey - for the price it's good,"I just set this up a couple of weeks ago so this isn't the most objective review, but if it helps someone with their decision, fine.The shipping was fairly quick. Packaging was very good. It's a big, heavy unit, so we needed to make more desk space.The setup was easy, fast, no issues.The manual is OK with the exception of the paper port discription. We had to search for a while.The ink cartriges are dinky, they installed OK, and we have printed several sheets and still have ink left. I understand that the cartriges that Canon supplies with the unit are not filled full.The print quality is very good on plain paper, but it streaked badly with photo paper. I think that may be a set-up issue on my part and I havn't tried to correct it yet. I use plain paper for cheap-o flyers for my business and it does a really good job with them.(...)(...)"
5,"Amazing for scanning, copying, and printing photos","After much research, I bought the MP750 for my dorm room. Although it is a monster in size, it performs each of its functions incredibly well. Using high-quality photo paper, I have printed better photos than I've gotten from photo labs. It scans very well and is pretty fast once it warms up. The MP750's copies are remarkable, in both black-and-white and color. The print dialog box allows for the user to choose from all sorts of photo effects--I recently printed a photo in vivid color without adjusting the actual photo--and other print settings. The 2-sided printing and copying and the automatic document feeder are especially useful for long documents. Even the software that came with the printer is great: programs that allow users to easily print webpages and scan documents to editable text, among other things. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the Canon MP750 to anyone seriously considering a multi-function."
2,definitely not technical !,"I bought this book in order to improve my knowledge on arbitrage. I was expecting to find some practical applications on the market like on (equity) pairs trading, yield curve arbitrage. The book provides a very broad and general overview on the concept of arbitrage and it is a very good book for someone who wants to understand the meaning of arbitrage and how and where he can do it. If you already know what arbitrage is, you dont need to read it."
3,"good introduction, but lack of depth...","This is a broad introduction into equity arbitrage world, but not much depth is provided. There is a better book on risk arb by Moore. I am still looking for a ""real"" book on statistical arb."
3,"Good overview, but lack of depth and focus","This book is a good introduction for those not familiar with arbitrage. However, the author tries to encompass every topic related to arbitrage which leads to loss of depth and focus. The big problem with this book is its misleading title, as it creates the impression that the book presents an in-depth and systematic review of arbitrage. If the title were ""An Introduction to Arbitrage"", everyone would be happy with it, since such a title would give a precise information about the book's content."
3,a strange book,"This or these books catch my imagination and inspire me to be creative . this is a good book to read if you are into strange things and chaotic mind .The dialogue is a bit hard to under stand but if you like it you wont care . I really like the third book because of its unhappiness . The only thing is that I cant understand who is talking in the story , not only is it fun to read but it is great to read to kids if you have any .If you are a teacher this is a great book to assign as a book to read . It would make children want to read instead of watching TV , it speaks to kids it might not be in a good way but it still speaks to them . I give this book a seven out of ten ."
2,Ok not the very best...,I have been reading this series from the very beggining and I have to say I am very dissapointed. We learn NOTHING new and the whole book seems pointless. I am hoping that this book was just a lead up to the last book where everything will be revealed. Still read the book because I guess it is crucial to the series but overall it was a big dissapointment.
5,The Best Yet!,"I never wanted to read the Series of Unfortunate Events. I considered them stupid. But then I read the first one, then the second, then the third, ect. I was crazy about them. So imagine how excited I was when FINALLY the twelvth came out! I thought it was the best one yet. The three siblings have to go to a hotel to spy there and figure out which one of the two workers there, acting as the same person, is the true person and which one is an imposter. Along the way they are surprised to find old friends and mostly old enemies. They can't have a break from the job. They even have to sleep at their desk! This book was sooo interesting, especially since the hotel is organized using the Dewey Desimal System! By the way, did you notice that there's one library in every book? The hotel was the library in this book! I highly recommend this book to any SOUF fan, and for the ones who haven't read the books... Start reading them NOW! They're awesome!"
4,Great book,You have to read the first 11 books to understand this one. I would recommend this book 4 people who have read the other books.
3,Hotel Drama,"The Penultimate Peril is the 12th book in the series of unfortunate events. It is about when Violet, Sunny, Klaus go to the Hotel Denouement to help Kit Snicket, and Frank, the manager of the hotel. The go to the Hotel Denouement to disguise themselves and observe their surroundings. Also they want to be there for the meeting of the members of V.F.D. The hotel has a very confusing system to organize it. They use the Dewey Decimal System.I really liked this book, but there were some things that I didn't like very much. One thing I liked was when the author was talking about the reflection in the pond, because he was very descriptive. But I didn't like the beginning when he kept talking in the beginning about stuff that didn't have anything to do with the book. All in all it was a very good book."
5,Love it!,"This whole series is the best! I have read every book twice or more! I recommend this book for everybody... but just be sure you read the other 11 first! This is awesome! Go to the library or order them RIGHT now! I LOVED it! I read them first in 3rd grade, now I am in 6th grade and I still read them!"
5,THE PNULTIMATE PERIL (A SERIES OF UNFORUNATE EVENTS) BOOK 12,"This book was purchased, along with Books 11 and 13 in this series, for my nine-year-old granddaughter. She hasn't read it yet, but has read other books in this series and enjoys them very much.the books was orderd two weeks prior to Christmas as a Christmas present and arrived in time to give her at Christmas and in very good condition."
2,Ok but ...,"After the first 11 books, that were laced with black comedy and inopportune situations handled and aligned in a way to make sense, the 12th books somehow leaves the reader gasping for more and ends with a flat note. I can, however, find cognizance with the moral of the story that sometimes people you think you are close to, fail you with their ""nobleness"" or lack of guts! That you have to find strength in yourself to fight your own wars and that a family has an important part to play when you're struggling through your live. I think the gist of the story is that that the three children find succor in each other - almost a live force driven by love, that protects them and eventually helps to extricate them from impossible situations!"
1,YAWN,"I am so disappointed by the twelfth book of the series. I had VERY HIGH HOPES after the whole on-line gaming, no title giving, no artwork revealing escapade that ended with three hundred and fifty some odd pages of FILLER. By FILLER, dear friends, I am referring to words and pages filled with STUFF that gets nowhere and provides nothing for the reader to take with them. All the other books were interesting, funny, thought provoking and fun. #12 was BORING, DULL and an insult to fans as it really feels like no time, energy or thought was put into this novel. ALSO, don't even get me started on the GRAMMER. I'm sorry but you are NOT supposed to begin sentences with BUT or ANDS. Come on...don't you have editors? Did Mr. Handler even WRITE this or was it his evil twin switch the manuscript? In conclusion, I give one star...but only because zero stars was not an option. ::insert angry, sad, and disappointed face here::"
4,Depressed myself,"If you want a book with adventure and excitement, with all-aroud drama, this is the one for you. I wouldn't call it realistic though... Harpoon guns brought to imature children, letting toddlers fullfill the tasks of a hotel consierge, and to ns of characters that act nowhere near there age are a few ways to describe the originality of this book. The three Baudelaire orphans try and escape vicous schemes of ""not noble"" people. Thwy always make escapes from the worste perdicaments, always narrow and keeping you on the edge of your seat. Sadly, they yet always seem to be in vain.The only obvious problem with the Series of UNFORTUNATE events is how dreadful and UNFORTUNATE it may make some feel. If you end up getting into unrealistic things, feeling as dramatic as the main characters, than don't bother. If you don't want to read a book to stir up your emotions, than forget this.So, if you can take the hardships of the Baudlaire orphans, than you know what to do."
3,The next to last peril wasn't as exciting as the next next to last peril was (book 11).,"I liked the book. I thought that it was good, but it had way too many rambles from Lemony Snicket. It felt like I had been cheated out of a good book. Book 11 was good and had a lot of exciting and new information, but all book 12 does is give you an overview of the people the Baudelaires have met through their series or unfortunate events. The book does add some interesting information to the series and also has a well written ending. I'm hoping thatbook 13 is better than the next to last peril (penultimate peril, book 12).thank you for your time,Loran"
4,Andy's Review,This was a very good book I did not find it as good as the others. This book solves a lot of the mysteries surrounding the Baudelaire orphans. And at the end is a twist that you never saw coming.In this book the orphans are concierges working at Hotel Denouement trying to find out if there are going to be villains on Thursday's V.F.D. Gathering. But the real hard part is how the noble person helping them frank has a identical twin on the other side of the V.F.D. schism named Ernest. He fakes being Frank to get the Baudelaire's to tell him noble people's secrets.This book is very far into A Series of Unfortunate Events the 12th out of 13 and I strongly recommend not to skip any of the earlier books. This book is on the same level of reading as any other book in this series it is just longer.
4,penultimate peril,its a book by lemony snicket.If you enjoyed his other books then you will probably this one also. it is revealing but it does not tell wether or not thier parents are alive
5,the penultimate peril,The penultimate peril is got to be the best book in the series of unforcinent eventsWhen sunny Klaus and violet arrive at the hotel document they have to get jobs s bellhops to hide form the sinister clutches of count olaf- a devious villain repedatly trying to obtain the badalire fortion their parents left behind. While the badalire orphans have to find a sugar bowl while staying under cover and serving count Olaf's minions.-Erik
1,THAT WAS TOTALLY WICKED,I TINK IT VAS A GWATE TV SHOW THEY SHOULD WIN AN EMMY. CONGRATS!YOUR MY HERO? TANKS A BUUNDLE. PEACE OUT BROTHERS
2,Terribly Disappointed,"I have really enjoyed this series. I work in a childrens section of a library and have the best time talking about these books with all the children that come in. Each book I like more and more, until this one. I read someone else's review that said this book was just full of ""stuff"" and that's exactly how I felt. I felt like each page was just full of nothing. Characters are just thrown in at random points and even the Baudelaires seem rather dull in this one. There were several parts where Snickets wit was wonderful but those parts were too sparse. I hate that I didn't like this book, it just seemed to have no real point. This was the first one I've actually gone out and bought since I can get them from work but since this one was new I didn't want to wait, and now I wish I would have."
4,Good!,This is my second favorite in the series. (favorite #6) It got a little dull at some parts but it was good. I can't wait for the next and last one.
3,Not the best. pretty much the same...,This series is sinking. THe author is simply stretching the book! They're concierges blah blah blah. its the same thing over and over. Its okay I guess. But it goes by too quickly like the 10th and 11th it seems like the author just wants to finish the series. Personally I would read this book to put your soul at ease of course you might think this book is excellent. I do not. But I'd still read it to put my soul at ease. Okay that's all I have to type.READ IT!
5,I can't describe with words how good this book is!,"This book is the best (and deepest) book in my opinion. In fact, there were a few times the I felt like crying, and a few times I felt like laughing. The book is filled with a broad spectrum of emotions, and Lemony Snicket really knows how to express them through writing. He's also a master of suspense. If you're looking for a good page turner, this is it! The quote at the end is espcially a tear-jerker, if you've read the whole book so far. ""Who knows when some slight shock disturbing the delicate balance between social order and thirty aspiration, shall send the skyscrapers in our cities toppling?""-Richard Wright"
5,Nearing The End,"The Penultimate Peril presents the most rapid departure from the early formats of the series by Lemony Snicket. In this book, Baudelaires do some fairly unthinkable acts. But in the broad scope, this novel makes a lot of sense.It amazes me how many characters in the book have missing and previously unknown relatives. Yet this addition to the series again finds the Baudelaires aligned with a character's previously unknown sibling, serving an important role. Arriving at the Hotel Denouement, the orphans find numerous familiar faces as well as foes. The peculiar arrangement of the establishment creates an interesting twist to the story. Of course, everybody awaits the arrival of the sugarbowl. Would those waiting be disappointed by the revelation? There is a 13th book.Nearling the end of the series, I am anxious to complete ""The End"" soon. While the series might wear out its welcome if it continues much longer, the angles of the story have managed to stay fresh."
4,From a cataloger (and kid) at heart,"I am a librarian who knows her Dewey fairly well. I was into Chapters 4, 5, & 6 that can be read in any order and one of our main characters was searching for an item and I stopped to try and think of the Dewey Decimal number. Would it be 355? No. Would it be 910? No. Would it be 623? No. I finally gave up and was surprised with both where the item was found and the ultimate end of the penultimate book. I had also had fun with the nameless novel website quizzes and really enjoyed the coded messages the best. I hope to introduce this series to my grandchildren once they are a few years older."
5,Awesome,Loved how creative these books are. It is super cool. We love all these books. They are great page turners
5,Good luck with lyrics and flutter on the word is magic series episode s in the word is magic series episode s in the word is mag,I am a lot of the word is a snow ball and flutter to the word is that the word out about the
2,Another advanced-level reading book for toddlers!,"COULD ANYONE EXPECT THE ENDING OF THIS BOOK BY ""THE"" LEMONY SNICKET?yes.....Lemony snicket does it again as he writes another book that a chinese boy in Malaysia could have written.How the Penultimate Peril is divided up-1/2= Snicket telling you to not read the book even though you've already spent 12 bucks on it1/4= Snicket defining words you learned in 4th grade, and telling of his supposed dead girlfriendThe other 1/4- The story!The plot is interesting, ive got to admit it, and its been a fun time, but please sjut tell us what the hell VFD means and ill be a satisfied customer. Ive been waiting five years to know what 3 freakin letters mean!So Lemony, when did you finally stop looking in the dictionary for a word that starts with ""P"" that could suit your title?Good night and good luck"
1,"Unbearabley long, painfully disappointing","My 6 year old and I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of book 12.We have just finished reading it tonight and I must express my disappointment at Mr. Snicket's latest effort. What a waste of time. It seems that success has gone to the author's head, or maybe he's just fresh out of ideas.Unlike the other books in this series, this one lacks a real plot, barely has any new characters and basically goes nowhere. Like most of the participants in this book, it seems that Mr. Snicket has been running around blindfolded while writing this tiresome tale."
2,Could be better,I think that this book was not as good as the other ones. It was really boring. But I think that alot of people will like this book. i reccomend it to every one else!!!!!!!!1
1,They stole a cab!,"Yep, thats what they did. The only noble person in the story, and they kicked him to the curb.Maybe he didn't want to pick up the the couple on the corner because the gentleman was smoking a cigar? Maybe he knew the woman and would rather have a civilized discussion over dinner rather than a huffy confrontation with a stranger.Or, maybe he knew the name of the silent screen starlet featured in the Unauthorised Autobiography.Where in this story are the Nazis, the Mob, the Terrorists, the corrupt Lawyers, the scheming marketing execs and the slimey Insurance salesmen?No, the story does not end at 13. I guarantee it!"
1,Merlin must have been a real scumbag.,"This story is pathetic, the writer is treacherous. Just plain terrible."
2,"The Penultimate Peril (A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 12)","The series has lost its charm and this book just doesn't compare to some of the earlier books: not as entertainment nor for educational value. The mirror writing was amusing, but was a bit overdone. We got the joke the first time... then it was just plain annoying. I am looking forward to the finale -- perhaps to be entitled: Ending Ennui."
3,I wanted it to be better than this,"I like ASoUE - I really do; but I was disappointed by the penultimate book in the series. While there are high points (specifically the return of many of the previous characters from the series - villains as well as friends of the Baudelaires), Book the Twelfth didn't advance the plot line of the continuing saga at all. What a bummer.The word play, the Various Funny Definitions of VFD and the tragi-comic episodes of the Baudelaires that you would expect are all here, but compared to many of the other books in the series, the magic isn't. And that's too bad."
2,The Penultimate Peril,"Next to last book. I have to give some credit to the man for writing so many books,and keeping audiences entertained, but regardless of that I wasn't very impressed. Sure, the ending made you wonder, but I got really bored waiting and waiting for the story to built up. I felt as if it never really went anywhere new with the orphans' life. I would have been much more inthused to see a new villian in the story.I do have faith in ol' ""Lemony"" though and I am expecting great things from the last book. I do think this is a key part of the series."
4,penultimate peril is ok,"I got this book the day it came out. i read the first chapter on lemonysnicket.com. it was very suspensful i had been anticipating the book's arrival for days. it is pretty good except there is no mention of the Quagmire triplets and what happened to them i think we all wanted to know. lemony snicket is a great author because he takes the time to make the book interesting for us readers to read, for example putting backwards sentences in parts of the book that you have to use a mirror to interpret. that is what's so genuine about him. but it was a little annoying to have to get a mirror and hold it up and read it that way. but it was cool. so anyway buy the book you will definetly not regret it!"
4,The Penultimate Peril,"In the twelfth book of A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket the Baudelaires' journey continues on a downward spiral. As the Baudelaires look for the Sugar Bowl they disguise themselves as concierges at the hotel where the Sugar Bowl is located. In their search the Baudelaires see some old faces and some new faces along the way. In the book Klaus, Sunny, and Violet learn some dark secrets about people they would never expect to have done bad things. The Baudelaires are trapped again by Count Olaf and must make important decisions that could impact the outcome of the battle, good versus evil. I highly recomment this children's mystery book if you enjoyed the first eleven books of the series. I give this book a rating of four stars because of the author's witty humor but not five stars because the author also does drag out the story too much. As the Baudelaires are close to the end of their journey there are still many questions left to be answered."
3,Worth it only for Joan,"This is basically a horrible movie. Just very, very bad. However, the closing minutes make it worth buying. The main character, a horny teenage boy, is seduced by his girlfriend's breathtakingly sexy mom (Joan Collins). Joan is xtremely sexy, and she seems to find the scene exciting as well (knowing her hunger for much younger men, I bet she was.) Her boyfriend now would have been younger than the kid in the movie at this time!! Yes, this is a very bad movie saved by a breathlessly erotic few minutes."
3,A bad movie......But I Love It!!!,"This dude has a girlfriend is is so obsessed with making the swim team that all she does is swim laps in the family pool to get her time down. Her boyfriend and friends have a sub-par garage rock group when not causing hi-jinx in school. A side plot is that the father of the girl who sings in the band is not allowed to be with them, because her boyfriend plays drums. They are not the 'right' crowd for her.Anyway at the end of the movie Joan (the mother of the swim team hopeful) seduces her daughter's boyfriend. They have a very steamy scene while the girl is outside swimming. Joan is the queen of seduction in my opinion (it wouldn't take her much effort to have me wrapped around her finger). That's about it. A pretty forgetable movie that keeps you waiting for the seduction scene."
2,"Please, Joan, try something else","Joan Collins, one of the most striking brunettes in show business history, played a cougar in this and a few other films, before the term cougar was coined. These films are creepy, because you get the feeling that this older woman is insinuating herself on some kid; actually corrupting the minor. It could be sexy if carried off perfectly, but what is carried off perfectly?If you want to see Ms. Collins at HER best, see Sunburn, a movie where her unbelievable beauty made co-star FarrahFawcett seem like a nobody. THis film is not a good venue; it is not funny, and it shouldn't be regarded as sexy, though some will."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this movie for Joan Collins so I was very disappointed that she was in so little of it. Joan is as sexy as ever as Diane, the mother of a very unattractive swimmer but this movie is pretty much all about goofy teenage boys/wannabe rock stars obsessed with ""getting laid"". There is one sexy scene towards the end between Diane and Tommy. That's pretty much all this movie is good for."
4,Look for big things from this spunky up-coming go-getter!,"Noted solar astronomer Bill Livingston, PhD is a talented photographer in addition to his amazing astonomy skills. The menagerie of photographs showcases his blossoming picture-taking magic. Look for big things from this spunky up-coming go-getter!"
2,Care Bear Hideaway,"smaller than expected...no floor, picture a bit decieving...no velcro to hold open flaps as depicted"
3,"A Thoughtful, Practical Book In Its Time",This book offers refreshingly candid advice in a straightforward way. I really liked the basic suggestions on diet and exercise. More recent books provide more insight and tons more ideas but this book offers great ideas to get started rather than a bewildering array of choices. All of the ideas are easy to follow and implement.
1,I wanted a Jitney Driver to run me over to end the pain!,"This play is horrible! Not only was it a flat narrative that was as shallow in it's arc as a puddle it was simply an amalgum of sterotypes parading as realistic characters. The dialogue was utter tripe, full as it was with clichés and predictable euphamisms. Why is that we accept bad writing through the use of stereotypes as long as that bad writing is coming from a member of that stereotyped group. All of the subplots were tact on, as if Wilson knowing his play did not have enough substance to sustain itself said ""Oh crap! I better put more into this!"". In the end they just add to the mess. Shame on you August Wilson! Hang your head in shame!"
2,False list price,"Not sure why this item is advertised as $93 plus... then to suggest is only $13 with 80% or so savings. This is wrong. The item retails for less than $5. I assumed it was a case of the notebooks, not one individual item. very dissapointing."
4,Can't take it off my mind.,I watched this movie during a rainy afternoon on the summer of 1982. Even after the years I just cant't take off my memory the scenes of Melody and her awakening to sexual affairs. Will watch this movie forever until I die.
3,Key video version is highly edited,"This movie is great and is a classic, but the Key Video version is a chopped up nightmare. If you remember the full movie, then you will be highly disappointed by the Key Video version. There are entire scenes missing and little bits here and there missing also. Try to find the uncut version. I can't."
3,This Version is seriously Chopped up,"A nice sexual awakening story and pretty island scenery.But, someone has GOT to get their hands on the uncut version. All of the soft core scenes have been sliced in this version (that I own). The result is that it is almost impossible to follow the story line. Yes there actually is a great story line.I watched this about 20 times in my younger days in Central America. One example, the next to final scene has Melody being intimate with a young man who had been watching (and stroking) watching Melody skinny dip in the pool near the beginning. Both of these scene were cut, so the end scene, when her Aunt says ""Melody!"" in surprise, the viewer has no idea why she says this."
3,Worth the time for Crawford fans,"This isn't one of Michael Crawford's best achievements, however, he does an excellent job playing Charlie Gordon. As in everything Crawford does, he is the show's rescuer. Some of the songs are rather clever as far as lyrics are concerned, but I think this classic story could have been handled a little better. Yet, it is definately worth having if you are a Crawford fan."
1,Questionable value,I found many errors in the book. It is far from being mathematically rigorous. Good as a general overview.
4,Instructions for Programming,"I bought this to replace a keypad that died. Installation was easy even though it came with no instructions and I had to reuse the old screws. I found these instructions on another site and now it works great!TO REPROGRAM YOUR KEP-1:Unplug the transformer for 2 minutes, this will reset the board and erase old code.Place the set / run switch to SET (found inside main interface box)Chose your pin number (1 to 8 numbers or letters). Do not use the * in your pin. Enter chosen pin.Press * button once to lock in pin number.Move the set / run switch to RUN. Programming is complete.*Be sure the knotch in the flat ribbon faces the Set/Run switch or your code will not be stored."
2,Not very rugged,"This was the second replacement keypad I've had to purchase for my Genie KEP-1. The flaw in them is in the ribbon cable which connects the keypad to the control module. For something that was meant to be mounted outdoors, the cable is susceptable to water damage. I think a more weatherproof connection should be designed for this appliance.I will give Amazon high marks for having this item in their inventory because if you have a KEP-1 you're going to need a replacement keypad at sometime."
3,Weatherproofing needed,"I had an old keypad that died after a winter storm. Water entered the keypad, corroding the bottom row of blister buttons.When I replaced it, I applied a bead of grey caulk between the button face membrane and the frame on the front of the unit and between the ribbon cable and frame on the back. Hopefully, this will prevent a similar failures in the future.Overall, it's not a very robust design and I would recommend placing it in a weather-protected location if possible."
2,Only Lasted 3 Months,"It was working fine for 3 months, then just about 3 weeks ago or so it stopped working. Suspecting other parts, I tested the transformer, then I dismount the controller and tested it in the house without the keypad. It works fine (I have an electrical engineering degree, so I know how to test it). Either the ribbon wire is broke (unlikely), or the keypad.I would really appreciate either a full refund or a replacement unit."
3,Not sufficiently focused on prospecting,"Joan has some useful suggestions and ideas in this book, but it covers the selling process as well as prospecting. For example, her chapter on ""Who's the boss?"" details how to move through and within a large organization to get approval for a proposal. While I suppose that can be considered prospecting by some, it's not in my definition. There are many useful conversational fragments in the book, but it is not as sharply focused on prospecting and cold calling as are others I have read."
4,"Robert Morse stars in funny, charming show with great tunes","I am thrilled that this wonderful, little-known musical recording is available through Amazon.com! The only version of it I have ever heard was given to me on a cassette tape by an old stage manager years ago . . . but I digress. You must hear this hilarious musical version of ""Enter Laughing"" starring the brilliant Robert Morse (before his star-making turn as J. Pierpont Finch in ""How to Succeed. . . ""), Charles Nelson Reilly at his quavery-voiced best as Morse's side-kick and my favorite, Kaye Ballard, as the quintessential Jewish mama. This show is chock-full of great character numbers (perfect for an unusual audition piece!) and is a real find for afficionados of delightful but obscure Broadway musicals."
2,Another Modest Correction...,"Also, I believe the ""quavering voice"" Victoria has identified as Charles Nelson Reilly is actually the delightful George S. Irving - perhaps best known for his voice-over work as the narrator of the TV cartoon series ""Underdog"" - along with many Broadway appearances throughout the years. He recently (September 2007) recreated this role at the York Theatre in New York when they presented this musical, retitled ""Enter Laughing"" as part of a Joe Stein (the bookwriter of the musical) retrospective of readings of his lesser-known works. I understand he was the highlight of a very enjoyable evening."
2,Description not accurate,"Description states that it ""includes frame with base attachment with hinges."" It does not. It is just the frame and screen. Save yourself a few bucks and buy the the other one that states it only has the frame."
2,some good some bad,"The other reviewers have it about right. I would add that the book is not a complete waste of time, just a partial one."
2,Great for the first day...,"My son turned 6 and loved this race set as we spent close to 3 or 4 hours racing it. THE VERY NEXT DAY we were racing and the red car hit a small bump/uneven part of the track and suddenly stopped. Upon further examination, a part of the main gear on the rear drive axel had broken off and had become lodged in the undercariage of the car. I'm in the process of returning it to the manufacturer for replacement/repair. The return policy states that any problems arising from improper use and removal of the plastic chasis from the undercarriage is not covered by the lifetime, limited warranty. If anyone is interested, I'll post my results after I send it in. Wish me luck!"
1,I did not get fairy in picture,I did not get fairy in picture and when I contacted seller to correct he was less than helpful. He said it was Amazons fault because he has no control over picture they put on net. It was not worth the hassel of sending back and the other fairy is cute. Just don't expect to get the one in picture.
5,a lovely guide to the underside of contemporary fiction,"This text has a very nice selection of offerings from some writers that you might not ordinarily encounter. As a primer to a more experimental fiction tradition, it works very nicely. Fits well into a fiction workshop, too, as it's not too pricey and packs a lot of bang in their for yr buck."
3,A rather banal bunch of blathering postmodern bathos,"An anthology with a few good authors like Barthelme, Angela Carter, Borges, Isaac Babel, etc., rounded out by a preponderance of pretty mediocre, boring post-modern short stories that rely a bit too much on gimmicks and metafictional concepts. But if you're going to charge $25+ for a paperback, even publishers are smart enough to make it seem a bit substantial. However,the reviews on the back cover are all from university professors, so it seems this book has been marketed as a college textbook. Unfortunately, the models here are more likely to choke creativity than inspire it. It has mock-Miro cover art to buttress the idea that the writing contained within is both unconventional and intriguing. Somebody forgot about that adage about the lack of a correlation between the content of a book and how it's bound. How does that saying go again?"
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK SHAM-A-LOT,"SHYAMALAN, if you're reading this, I WANT MY MONEY BACK DAMN IT. YOU SUCK. I wasn't going to give this any stars but Amazon made me give you one star so thank them for it. If it was up to me, I'd buy all the copies of this movie and take a nice crap on them, then piss on them and then burn them and have them launched in space. Even the burnt remains aren't good enough to stay on this planet. WHERE'S MY MONEY SHYAMALAN, GIMME MY MONEY BACK."
1,One dumb movie!,"This has to be the dumbest movie I have ever seen. The acting was lousy, the dialog was lousy. No special effects at all. This movie sucks. I wouldn't recommend watching it on late night TBS. Can't wait to throw my blu ray disk over the water like skipping a rock. This has to be one of M. Night's worst movie. Dude! What is wrong with you! Your movies are great, but this one really sucks... big time. Ok... so you're allowed to have one movie that sucked. Ok... let this one be it. No more sucky movies. BTW, did I mention this movie sucks! It really does SUCK! No kiddling either! What a sucky but movie. Did they hold a gun to your head to make this movie? It really sucks... so terrible. Couldn't even finish the movie. So bad... YUK!"
1,Mother Nature can bite my bottom,"I saw this movie in theatres on opening day. I was excited to go, because I have enjoyed M. Night's other works. Needless to say I was not only disappointed; I was angry. After this putrid pile of nothing, I decided to do three things. A. I punched the first tree I saw in the face. B. I will not go see anymore M. Night movies in the theatre. 3. I took a whole packet of paper and burned in front of tree. This movie stinks. Do not buy it. Do not rent it. Do not even mention it to other people."

1,"really bad, but maybe someday it will be so bad it's good","I would give this one a 0 if I could, one of the worst movies I have seen in recent times, actually the worst (until I saw part of Rage by Sally Potter). For the people that think the director is another Hitchcock, you can't be serious, can you?"
3,"AN ORIGINAL IDEA, HORRIBLE ACTING, BUT YOU MAY LIKE IT..","If you are expecting a masterpiece from M. Night, than this will let you down. Zooey, whoever, should be put on Hollywood's Blacklist due to not being able to act. She has a blank, emotionless expression throughout the entire film. The guy who played Tony Soprano's son was just as ""believable"".Not the best acting by Mark Wahlberg either, but his character is somehow likable enough.Enjoy it for it's unique concept/story and forgive M. Night, it's way better than Lady In The Water.What did kill off the dinosaurs?"
3,This deserves more than 1 star!,"I agree that this is not Shyamalan's best movie. As another reviewer said, many people are looking for the next ""Sixth Sense"". This is definately not that. But, I do not think that it deserves all of the 1 star reviews it is getting. I do agree that the plot was a little weird and unbeleivable. But this was still a decent movie. It is very suspensefull, and kept me on the edge of my seat a few times. If you like Shyamalan's other movies you should at least see this one. I believe that it is better than ""Lady in the Water"".I agree this was not a phenomenal movie, but it deserves more than one star."
1,This movie sucks!,"This movie is really, really bad. The director has fallen a LONG way since sixth sense. I found myself laughing when I was supposed to be scared. If I could have given this movie negative stars, I would have."
1,60 Million? I just don't get it!,"Sorry to fans of this film but I've just watched a second time (don't ask me why) and it still infuriates me as to how this film ever got made.I understand that it is Shyamalan's take on 9/11, the times are in sync, the people falling from the buildings, the unknown attacker - I get it, I really do but I hate it. It's badly made, badly acted, terribly written and has to go in my top ten worst films ever made.From this point in my life I will never watch an M. Night Shyamalan film ever again.A good director and good writer could have made a masterpiece with $60million - good directors don't even need a tenth of that!Shocking, really shocking and not in a good way! Please don't watch this film however much you might love Zooey Deschanel!"
4,good movie,"I like this movie. I am a big fan of mark wahlberg. Mark is a cool dude. The movie, is 4 out of five from begining to the end."
1,The Happening by Brandon M. Moskos,"Bottom line.... THIS MOVIE WAS AWFUL!!! M. Night's most disappointing film ever. People killing themselves because of the environment and nature???? That is just dumb. And what makes it worse is that they give away the reason they are killing themselves pretty much in the beginning of the movie. I thought about buying it, but I rented it, and that was a great decision on my part. I like Mark Wahlberg, but he was awful, and so was John Laquazamo!! I don't blame the actors though, because the script sucked. Please overlook this movie if you can, not good at all."
1,Don't waste your money,"Lousy script and lousy performances . Mark Wahlberg,you are too good to be in such a lousy boring movie. Save your money and don't rent it."
1,Last Straw,"I am in agreement with most, the sixth sense was great but M. Night Shymalan has gone down hill after that. I can't believe I actually sat through this whole movie. After the village, which was a total disappointment I thought that would be it. With Mark Walberg in it, I thought it had a chance. I will never watch another M. Night Shymalan movie...."
1,Great Comedy!,"If you are looking for a good laugh then I would suggest this film. Wahlberg is a joke and Liguizamo looks like a homeless man. This is actually the worst movie I have ever seen. You will feel the same way when the army guy in shock of seeing the dead bodies cries out ""cheese and crackers"" LOL"
1,"""Nothing was happening""","I thought this movie was sooo boring!! The beginning of the movie was pretty good but thats where all the good parts were, and then it just drug on and on and on... and bored me to death. If u wish to see this movie, I would rent it ONLY!!! Do not buy it because u will be disappointed. :)"
2,"Cool concept, but poor execution","First off, I am not a M. Night Shyamalan hater. I really loved The Sixth Sense and I enjoyed Unbreakable and Signs. The Village was average at best and Lady in the Water was pretty awful. The Happening couldn't be his third bad movie in a row, right? I'm sorry to say that this is one of worst movies I have seen this year and I've see a lot. The concept is neat and there are some creepy elements early on, but it just gets worse as it goes along. The acting is very bad from almost everyone involved and the dialogue makes things even worse. I just don't know what is going on with this once promising director. I'm glad I listened to the critic's reviews and waited for this one to hit DVD."
1,Shockingly bad,"Let me preface by saying I'm not a troll that 1-Stars movies lightly. But this? It plays out like a parody of those old 1950s movies, before things like film-acting and special effects were invented (just kidding...uh...somewhat...).Its been a looooong time since I've seen actors phone in their performances like Wahlberg and Leguizamo have done here. NO, WAIT! Tim Allen in ZOOM, yeah, its about that speed.Truth is, though, when things fall apart, I'm a ""blame the director"" type of viewer (but come on guys, didn't you watch the dailies???). Fascinatingly misdirected by Shymalan, you will swear you're watching a student film. And I liked everything he did up 'til Lady in the Bathtub.Beware: Zooey's facial expressions aren't for the faint of heart."
2,ATTACK OF THE VEGETATION !!!!!,"My least favorite of the M. Night Shyamalan movies. This story was asad waste of acting talent, a very solid cast was assembled. The firstpart of the film shows promise, with humans affected by a possible bio-hazzard strike. People start dying off in the eastern cities, no oneknows why. Panic and paranoia set in and it looks like something from IAm Legend. A pocket of survivors get out and they are divided on whatto do. The final premise is a bit strange, a Man vs. Nature plot. Canthey survive the angered local vegetation?"
2,"Cool concept, but poor execution","First off, I am not a M. Night Shyamalan hater. I really loved The Sixth Sense and I enjoyed Unbreakable and Signs. The Village was average at best and Lady in the Water was pretty awful. The Happening couldn't be his third bad movie in a row, right? I'm sorry to say that this is one of worst movies I have seen this year and I've see a lot. The concept is neat and there are some creepy elements early on, but it just gets worse as it goes along. The acting is very bad from almost everyone involved and the dialogue makes things even worse. I just don't know what is going on with this once promising director. I'm glad I listened to the critic's reviews and waited for this one to hit DVD.The Blu-ray does offer good picture and sound quality. The extras are just standard stuff and nothing that interesting."
3,Average movie stuff,"Started out cool and freaky, but like most horror movies, they over compensate with too much information and leave nothing to the imagination. This movie starts off with a lot of promise and then slowly declines towards the end. It could have been done better if the director didn't get lazy and just allow it to fall apart. I gave this film three stars."
1,Good if you want to kill a few brain cells,Absolutely atrocious movie. But kind of in a so-bad-it's-good way. You will definitely feel significantly stupider after watching this movie.
1,Terrible,"Sorry, I just couldn't buy it. Another movie with a huge buildup and a lame explanation. I have enjoyed some of Sham's movies, however they seem to get worse and worse..."
2,Can I Breathe The Outside Air?,"Can I breathe the outside air,Or will it harm me. Okay I love Mark Wahlberg, he's an amazing actor, but this movie got me lost.I still don't get it.But,like i said,you have to watch it for yourself.I Give It 2 !/2 Stars."
1,Two Thumbs Down,"M. Night Shyamalan has brought us the '#1 thriller of all time', The Sixth Sense. He kept us on the edge of our seats during Signs, and left us stunned in The Village. However, his most recent movie release, The Happening is anything but happening.Being a fan of the thriller/horror movie genre, I was very intrigued by the previews of this flick. People are suddenly dying and there seems to be no logical explanation. The movie's ""hero"", Mark Wahlberg, tries to find the answer and save the day as he runs from the invisible killer. This makes up the entire movie plot.I kept waiting for it to get better. Let me rephrase that. I kept waiting for it to get good, and was disappointed. Mark Wahlberg's acting skills seem to deteriorate along with the plot as the movie progresses. Even he seems as though he's bored with the movie's story line. I have watched a lot of horror movies. I have seen the worst of the worst, and The Happening was definitely in the 'worst' pile."
1,What's happening?,"Oh God, I love these reviews. I got more enjoyment reading the one stars than the actual movie. This kind of reminds me of the movies Mystery Science Theater 3000 used to make fun of. Killer trees...come one man!!! I thought the trees in Lord of the Rings had better action then this. What about flowers, and grass, and weeds, and shrubs, and moss, and mushrooms?!?!? What about the two guys who were in the boarded up house with openings you could stick your hands through, who had guns, and shot the kids? Why didn't they shot themselves?!!? Too many loose ends."
1,Oy.,"""The Happening"" is just another piece in the growing mountain of evidence that M. Night Shyamalan is a horrifically overrated moviemaker. I have been duly unimpressed with some of his earlier efforts, but this one takes the proverbial cake. Bad acting, a bad storyline, an anemic cast, and a heavy dose of left-wing eco-propaganda all combine to make this an eminently forgettable story -- except for the indelible scar that it has left on my beleaguered psyche. There's really no need to say much more. Other reviewers have already told more than we really need to know. In an effort to set this one in proper context, however, I will conclude by noting that ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" has found a soulmate."
1,Save your money,"What a piece of crap. The acting was horrible. Wahlberg looked like he threw his acting like a boxer throwing a fight. Did Wahlberg and Leguizamo do this movie because they owed Shyamalan money, or did they all get high and decide this is a really good story. The movie leads you to believe the plants and trees are making the characters commit suicide. I think they are committing suicide just to get out of the movie."
3,Empty and disappointing,"The Bottom Line:The Happening isn't quite as bad as some people would lead you to beleive, but it's close: Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel are almost criminally bad in the leads, plants are just not a cinematic enough villain (see also: The Ruins) and the ending leaves a lot to be desired.2/4"
3,"OK, so I admit it... I'm biased.","With any other director behind the wheel, this would have been a decent attempt. But for M. Night, this is rather weak. I've watched and loved all his films (even the not so warmly received ones), but this was just not good enough for a director his caliber. Yes, it's nicely filmed, no complaints there. The acting is decent. The suspense and the unsettling weirdness are there. What isn't there is the payoff. There's no trademark Shayamalan twist, no mind-boggling revelations, no explosive finale that sends you on an emotional roller coaster. There are plenty of plot holes. The ""happening"" itself isn't really explained. No, in fact we're told outright that it was ""something that occurred naturally and may never be fully explained"". I get the impression that M. Night wasn't really sure what movie to make, and once he had begun making it, he wasn't sure where he was going with it. It wasn't terrible. It just wasn't good enough. Not for M. Night."
3,"Good start, but........","The movie starts good but it just stalls out half way to the end. Interesting concept, but nevertheless weak rendition overall. Good acting, decent script and that is all!"
1,"if you like feces, you'll love ""the happening""","and on the flipside, if you liked ""the happening"" you most probably love feces. this movie was a fecal mess belched out of the anus of everyones favorite armchair messiah, m night shyamalan. the people praising this movie as ""brilliant"" drank way too much of the kool aid."
2,Not up to par with Shyamalan's earlier films,"I loved the first four movies that Shyamalan did. I didn't even mind ""The Lady in the Water."" This movie, however, was nothing but an environmental remake of ""The Birds (Collector's Edition)."" I'm not a big fan of propaganda movies. Yes, the environment is important, but I don't need that shoved down my throat by a movie that is supposed to entertain me.Now, it wasn't all bad. Shyamalan has a great eye when directing. He, along with the likes of Spielberg and Scorsese, has the gift of making every shot in the movie artistic. Even mundane conversations during the film have that artsy feel. However, none of the other elements I've come to love about Shyamalan (the unexpected plot twists, the surprise endings, the clues that you pick up on during repeated viewings) were there.Shyamalan should stick to making entertaining movies, and leave the overtly political statements to the activists."
1,Waste of Time,"The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable are two of my favorite movies, so I keep giving M. Night Shyamalan another try. The Happening might be the worst 2 hours I've spent watching a movie ever.I don't usually write reviews, but this was so awful I hope I can save at least one person out there from this mess. I wish I could unsee this movie, it was a total waste of time."
1,dont bother,"i usually love M. Night shamylan's work. I even love Lady in the Water (it's a different story for him, but it's a fairy tale, and if you give it that credibility, it works).We rented The Happening, and it was terrible. Right from the get go, I just didn't believe it. There was some effort to allude to phenomenon in Nature we don't understand - Colony Collapse Disorder. But it was not enough to support the entire film.There was no ending. really truly no ending.This was just a venue to find as many different ways to kill people as possible, for no reason.This idea of Nature turning on us could be really fascinating, but this was not it. (The Birds is still an amazing film after all this time.)The Happening smacked of War of the Worlds at points, and not in a good way.Whoever said this is Shamylan's best work since Sixth Sense is terribly terribly wrong.Do Not Waste Your Time or Money."
1,"This movie should be called ""The Unforgiveable""","Oh, M. Night...I've given you many chances. I loved Sixth Sense, Signs, Unbreakable, and the Village was decent. But this movie makes Lady in the Water look like a masterpiece. It was a glorified ""B"" movie at best, and I think I'm being generous. I could buy the storyline had another director taken on the task of making this film and developing the script to make it realistic. In contrast, it was like watching a train wreck...the dialogue was elementary and made the acting subpar and laughable. The story felt amateur and therefore comedic rather than scary. I'm suspecting that M. Night just gave up and needed to cash in to pay off some debts. Never again...never again..."
1,Are You Kiddin me?!!,What was this? I like Mark W. but this has to be his worst movie. Trees blowing in the wind is so scary...Boo! Bad acting and story inflicted on me just to get to the main meaning. The Happening is not. The real reason that everyone died in this movie is they just saw the Happening. Painful you will see.
1,It's Not Happening!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever sat through. The actors don't even try and the scenes that are supposed to be scary are mostly comical. There are a few bloody moments thrown in, I guess, to make this seem more like a horror movie but they end up just being gross. Mark Wahlberg is completely inept at playing an average Joe nice guy. He needs to stick to the tough guy roles. The only actor in the movie that is believable is Betty Buckley as the crazy old hermit woman. My advice is don't waste your time or money on this one. M. Night Shamaylan needs to go back to the drawing board. I usually like his movies but this one - well, it just isn't happening!"
1,Worst movie ever,"My fiance and I watched this last night and found it to be downright HORRIBLE. It was gruesome, made no freaking sense--all these people just decide to start offing themselves due to some chemical in the air emitted from plants. STUPID. And Zooey Deschanel's acting was absolutely atrocious. 2 hours of my life I will never get back. Don't waste your time on this movie. THis is the last M. Night Shamalamadingdong movie I will ever waste my time on."
1,Don't waste your time or money on this movie,I rented this movie because I thought that being directed by M. Night Shyamalan it might actually be suspenseful - thought of Steven King's novel 'The Stand' actually - but to be blunt if I were to see this movie in a theatre I would walk out - thankfully I rented it (out one dollar and an hour and half of my life!) but at least I could walk to the fridge and have some snacks while watching it without the fear of losing out on anything.After Mark's fine acting in the 'The Departed' he took 10 steps back as an actor in this movie - what a shame.I might be out a buck but Mark's acting career might be on the line as a result of this lame movie.The plot you ask? Plants attacking the human race via airborne toxic agents that makes people commit suicide.Bottom-line: I think it will be a LONG TIME before any Hollywood studio bankrolls M. Night Shyamalan's future films after this one!
2,Was this a joke.....,"As my brother put it, for being called, ""The Happening""....nothing happened. I think the idea behind it is interesting, but the movie just didn't meet the full potential it had the opportunity to. The acting by Zooey was terrible. I expecting much more from all I've heard of her talent. Disappointing to say the least."
2,What Happened?,"This movie is off kilter all the way through but I'm giving it 2 stars because at least it's consistent in that. Overall, I found this to be pretty much a waste of time. Meanwhile, be sure an pay your lawn a compliment every now and then, otherwise, if this movie's premise is correct, it's only a matter of time until it gets you."
1,Without value.,"This is really a terrible movie. Makes you wonder why anyone would actually choose to be part of something so bad. Mark Wahlberg has apparently forgotten what acting is, and Zooey Deschanel as his wife seems lost in space or perhaps spaced and lost. Totally without value as even the script is worse than bad. Don't waste any time viewing."
1,Terrible,"I don't have very much to say about this movie, just that it is a waste of time to watch it. I wish I could have given it less than a star."
1,One Of The Worst Movies I've Ever Seen,"After the incredibly awful The Village, I avoided Girl In The Water and didn't even want to see this. But a free rental coupon can sometimes make one do crazy things.This movie is flat out terrible. There is no story. The characters are laugh out loud lame. The acting is simply awful.What has happened to this visionary film maker?Buy this movie? Not on your life!Rent this movie? For your own sake, don't.Watch on TV down the road? Only if you have absolutely nothing better to do.The Happening is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Period."
3,So So,"Well, I'll be brief. This movie will produce a wide variation of opinions from many people. It's just one of those movies that will. My opinion is that I enjoyed the acting and also enjoyed the mystery of what was ""happening"". But I found myself waiting a bit too long. I did find the story/concept itself interesting as that nature can only take so much from mankind and it's increasing pollution being applied to Earth. Kind of a like a fail-safe switch got turned on by nature. I won't say anymore. And your opinion does not make you dumb or stupid as one reviewer placed here. You may like it, love it, hate it or just plain find it o.k. And that is ""O.K""."
1,"No Stars ""Worst Movie I Have Seen !!","Don't even bother wasting your time with ""The Happening"". If you want to see a ""bad"" movie then just get ""Teenagers from Outer Space"" and enjoy a ""bad"" movie."
1,If you want to see this..just watch the Trailer,"Boring. Slow. Dry. Bland preformances for interesting actors. If you want to see a better movie along these lines, watch the Signal."
1,The Crappening!,"This is probably M Knight's worst movie to date. I expected to see a decent flick atleast....not even close! The movie has a few shocking scenes but other than that, litterly NOTHING happens in this movie. I wish i didn't waste tickets to see this in theaters. I highly suggest to save your money, and go rent/buy another flick. You really couldn't pay me to own this, i would never watch it again. If you thought Lady in the Water was bad, you haven't seen anything yet..."
2,Has M. Night lost his magic?,"I like most of Shamaylan's movies (ok, 'Lady In The Water' was pretty weak), but this one is pretty mediocre. Mark Wahlberg is really weak in the leading role - he's not my favorite actor anyways. And the film actually even managed to make Zoeey Deschanel look slightly unappealing (whereas I think she's normally smokin' hot!)."
2,Disappointing,"This is a ""B"" or even a ""C"" movie with first-class funding and cinematography. The story sucks, the script doesn't improve on the story, and the performances are unimpressive. I'm a fan of ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Sixth Sense,"" as well as actors Mark Walhberg and John Leguizamo, but after the truly atrocious ""Lady in the Water"" and this completely pedestrian ""B"" movie (it probably should have been filmed and sold straight to the Sci-Fi channel, where it would have been great!) someone, somewhere, needs to step in and get Shamalyan's head straight."
3,ALERT....... FIRM WERE UPDATE NEEDED SONY's BDPS-300 BLU RAY PLAYERS,THE DVD THE HAPPENING IS A REAL GOOD MOVIE TO WATCH BUT THE MAIN THANG IS THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SONY BDPS-300 BLU RAY PLAYER HAS TO UPDATE FIRM WERE IT TO 4.02 FROM 3.95 THE MOVIE WILL ONLY PLAY UP UNTIL THE MENU SCEEN COMES ON THE FUCTIONS LIKE START MOVIE & SCEEN SECLECT THE SECLECT CURSER WOULD REMAIN STUCK. IT WOULD PLAY FINE INTO A PLAYSTATION 3. SO CALL SONY FOR AND FIRM WERE UPDATE. THEN THE HAPPENING WOULD PLAY IN YOUR SONY BDPS-300.
4,Not what I expected,"I've seen all of the work of this director, but this film was different. There were a few events that were meant to be shocking, but I found that they were distracting from the plot line.The main character was my favorite. He was believable, and easy to follow.All in all, it was not 2 hours wasted, but did seem to drag on more than the other films by this writer/director. It is good to have for a collection, if you aren't a collector rent it. It is good for a friday night, especially now around Halloween."
1,Make him stop,"The ego of M. Night has really started to affect his work. Maybe if he let someone else either write, direct, or produce part of the film he might create a higher quality product. My theory is that Signs and The Sixth Sense were good because he didn't have the arrogance (or the power) to take credit and control literally and nominally for the whole project. He used to collaborate with talented people and was able to optimize the product based on his personal skill set. Now The Happening is just a real-life nightmare of film-making that we're all going to have to live with (hopefully as many of us will be able to steer clear of it as possible).Now would be a good time to mention that my nephew also writes, produces, and directs his own films and is putting out stuff of about the same quality as The Happening.I've never been so appalled at the lack of quality of a film before. I didn't know where to go for relief / justice--I figured Amazon was the place. Man, this was awful."
1,Worst major release of the year,"The first twenty minutes are pretty good, but folks, by the end you will witness some of the worst dialogue ever written for film. So bad, that it might give The Happening a second life as a cult film (so bad, it's good). I couldn't believe the Amazon blurb above, that said Shyamalan is a genuis with dialogue. Shyamalan's camera work is, as always, good, and he was able to stock the movie with good actors -- but you have to give those actors something remotely believable to say! I think I read somewhere that Shyamalan said this was meant to be a B movie, only the best ever done. In his Legend-in-his-own-mind dreams! I'll take a bad John Carpenter effort any day over this limp stuff. This guy has a serious ego problem, and needs to give up script writing and start looking for outside material."
1,The absolute worst movie of 2008!!,"First off, I really do like M Night Shyamalan movies. I loved the 6th sense, Signs, and I liked Lady in the Water. I am a fan of his stuff and was excited to see this...until i actually watched it in the theater....This movie was soo bad, people in the movies were actually laughing and i counted 5 people that left mid movie when everyone found out what was killing everyone (it could be the 5 people left for different reasons or not). I mean i have a real open mind about movies, but this is silly. My girlfriend and I were rooting for the people to kill themselves cause we hated it so much. In the end, i wanted everyone in the movie to die...it was that bad."
1,DUD!,"The wind blowing was the most exciting part of this film. Stiff and unrealistic acting are, I guess, supposed to give it a certain ""feel"". Bunk! There was nothing redeeming in this film at all, except the actors and crew were employed. Sorry. Save your $$$."
1,I wish something had happened...,"Well, 3 strikes you're out: THE VILLAGE, THE LADY..., and now, THE HAPPENING. What is happening with M. Night is what I'd like to know. Talk about dismal. Such a great concept that goes absolutely no where. The actors seem to move from 'what am I doing here?' to 'get me out of here!' Don't look for the pay-off. That way you won't get angry about wasting you're money on this movie.There are two highlights to this film: The opening and closing credits. You can watch the sky transform in beautiful timelapse photography as you read the names of all the criminals involved in the making of this unintentional disaster flick."
1,The Ironic Title Doesn't Save it,"Poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly edited and with poor music cues, The Happening is a downright terrible movie. Featuring Mark Wahlberg as a science teacher who doesn't believe in science but does love mood rings, and Zooey Descanel as his wife who is guilt-ridden over a dessert with a co-worker (not a euphemism!) and possibly also over her inability to express more than two emotions, the film features a plodding, embarrassingly juvenile plot capped off by a bit of terrible exposition that doesn't actually reveal anything, The Happening is a simply a terrible film.On the plus side, if you've ever wanted to see Mark Wahlberg give a monologue to a plastic plant, this is your movie."
4,A modern day Hitchcock thriller,I don't understand why this film received so many negative reviews. M Night is a modern day Hitchcock. I love this film not only because I feel it is a story about the end of days and God's wrath but because Night is able to drive fear without ever showing us what we are afraid of. Hitchcock developed an entire genre of films around this and didn't need a million dollar budget of special effects to do it. He did it subtly and repeatedly thoughout the entire film and Night does the same thing here. So many reviewers were disappointed about not know what was happening - that is the point!
3,Fun but stupid,"The people being attacked do the exact wrong thing -- head for open countryside. According to the logic of toxic agent, they should have locked themselves in cellars in the city.It is a fun but kind of gory movie, nevertheless."
1,Horror-rible!!!!,"After reading the favorable comments of Richard T. Jameson, the Amazon editor above, I wondered if he had seen the same awful movie I had. THE HAPPENING is the worst of a long list of terrible films by M. Night Shyamalan. I honestly don't understand why he keeps getting money to do garbage. Then I went to a website called <thenumbers.com> to see what the box office numbers looked like for the film. They were impressive. THE HAPPENING's budget was $60,000,000 and its worldwide box office receipts totaled $163,000,000. It must have been music to the ears of executives in Hollywood, who care about one thing and one thing only...money!!! As long as Shyamalan continues to make money for the studios, he will continue making horrifically bad films. In my opinion, he's a one note wonder who hasn't anything worthwhile since THE SIXTH SENSE (a wonderful movie). I will never see another of his films."
1,It's just bad!,I can't believe I wasted an hour and a half and three dollars on this. It just sucks. Read the reviews or find out for yourself if you must. Mark Wahlberg can usually act but apparently not when M.Night is directing.
3,The Happening,"The quality of the product was fine and the movie was OK. I bought it because I grew up in the area where it was filmed and the director used some locations owned by friends of mine. As a matter of fact, one of the owners was in the film...briefly."
1,The Happening,"The Blu-Ray disk didn't play, couldn't even get it to play the previews of begining of the DVD disk. I would like to get another copy of the same DVD"
3,"Nice, but kind of a waste of good actors.","Nice thriller, if it were not for the hard to believe fiction!It was like those fictional thrillers about some unbelievable event killing lots of humans.But it is so hard to believe, that pretty soon you get bored."
3,This is movie is supenseful and shocking in some scenes. It's more like a drama than a thriller.,"**** SPOILER AHEAD****This is movie is supenseful and shocking in some scenes. For example, in the scenes where people were fleeing the city. Everybody was puzzled and did not know what's happening. I could see the anxiety and puzzlement on their faces. In another scene, it shocked me when the kid was shot in the face after he banged on the door of the house.The thing that let me down the most was the love between Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel. There's some chemistry between them but it's not portrayed strong enough. If it had been, it would have made the movie more touching and lovely.Overall, it's more like a drama than a thriller. It's still worth watching once."
3,Such promise...VERY disappointing finale!,"The HappeningThe first 45 minutes of this movie are truly creepy. From there, I was ready to call this one of the better Horror/Suspense movies I've seen in a very long time. Then, Night dropped the ball and completely blew it in the last act.I can actually receommend this for some of the best storytelling this year for nearly an hour. Since the movie only runs 90 minutes, I'll reason it this way: The MAJORITY of this movie is spectacular. ;)"
1,Nothing Happened!!!!,"I will keep this review very short. No matter how much of the movie you watch waiting for something great, good or just interesting to HAPPEN. NOTHING happens in this movie. It is by far another failed attempt by M Night to make a movie. Give it up already you was lucky once please make no more movies. The store line is sooo stupid and I feel bad for just sitting though it saying something is going to happen."
1,The worst movie of the year,"If you want to list all the bad aspects of this movie, these are:1. Bad acting: I think that the woman that appears as spouse of Mark, learned acting by internet or tapes.2. Poor story: Something that could be interesting was transformed in something boring and without sense.3. I could'nt understand the anecdote of the woman going out for once with ""Joey"" to have one coffe, treated as the cheating of the year, is stupid.4. Bad directing, even Mark Whalberg and Leguiziamo are bad in this movie.This movie is good if you have undesirable visitors at your home."
1,Boooriinnng,"M Night is a bad writer. The dialog was so bad it distracted from the movie. I really wanted to like this movie as I love post-apocalyptic plots, however, this movie was far too boring. There really is no reason to ever watch this one again. The plot and acting were very thin... Now that I think about it, the story was stupid too. Very disappointing.If you like post-apocalyptic stories, watch 28 Days Later instead."
1,What a BS!,"To see this come from the director of Sixth sense was a complete snooze. I mean, come on! Wind carrying neurotoxins, and so precisely sparing the lead cast and killing everyone else. And the first scene with the fake plastic face sticking herself with a pencil, I thought this is where I am going to die. Jesus!Shyamalan, dude go back to selling gola ganda in India."
3,What's happening?,Good movie. Not a box office hit but worth watching. It kept my attention most of the time.
3,Same As War Of The World,"I finally have the chance to see this movie. This movie is pretty scary. After I finish the movie, I have a strong feeling that I have seen this before. War of the World with Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning just come to mind.This movie is exactly the same as War of the World from start to end. Monster comes. Good people run. Good people meet other people. Good people find out good people are just as bad as the monster. Lesson learned. Monster goes away. The end. The only different is that lesson from War of the World is that you should always fully cook your chicken before you eat it.Mark Wahlberg is great in this moving. Much much better than Tom Cruise. Zooey Deschanel and the other little girl do absolutely nothing to this movie. Mark Wahlberg is the one who is doing all the talking.The DVD comes full with extra. 5 stars for the DVD.The movie is just ok to me. 3 stars."
1,The Happening,Once again Amazon has sent a BlueRay that doesn't open past the menu. This the fourth one I've paid for.
1,"""The Crappening""","The ""Crappening"" has to be the biggest dissappointment I've had in a movie in a very long time. The plot was lame, the acting was worse. I've seen B movies with better acting. The ending was stupid and very anti-climactic. Fortunately the award for worst ending has already been set in stone by ""The Mist""...Don't waste your money renting...don't waste your money on the energy it would cost to watch the movie on cable either..."
1,Disappointed!,"This movie had potential. I repeat, HAD potential. Seems like he rushed an ending that did not rise to Shyamalan's other hits. He is a hit or miss writer these days. Although, I am still a fan :)"
1,1/4*,"I had really low expectations for ""The Happening"", the person I know that loves this kind of movie the most hated it, and the people whom I almost always agree with hated it. But my kids wanted it and I thought ""How bad can it be?"" It has to be better than they say...It has Mark Walberg whom I usually enjoy, and director Shyamalan made the ""Sixth Sense"" which I loved. What I should have thought was ""What if it is worse than ""The Village?""Sad to say it was."
1,Just. . . Wow,"I have to say that I watch a lot of horror movies but this movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The director has absolutely no creativity in the ""disease"" and how the people kill themselves off. Its just a poorly made movie."
1,worse than an abortion,"I think that's pretty much I've to say, I'll rather see my wife aborting a monkey than watching this movie ever again. It shouldn't have been produced ever, at all."
3,Suspend your disbelief...give it a chance,"SPOILER ALERT - when (if) you see this movie, you will realized this is M. Night's 'GREEN' movie.With that said, I belive that this movie will in fact grow in acceptance down the line. While the acting is (at BEST) wooden and absolutely deadpan, the theme of the movie does have merit. The delivery falters, both on M. Night's direction and Mark Wahlberg, John Leguazamo, and the rest of the cast, but there is a heart to this film and a message and a reason to take notice. Maybe down the line (when all the polar ice caps have melted), this will be a nostalgic film that people will say, 'That's what it was like when it went wrong'.Not his best, but then again, nothing will ever top 'The Sixth Sense'"
3,Better than Lady in the Water.,"The Happening starring Mark Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel is a film by M Night Shyamalan. This film is silly but so much more watchable than his last two films. The acting from Wahlberg is over the top, I have never seen him this loopy and inconsistent. Some of the scenes push the envelope, some work and some don't. This thriller is a mixed bag for me, decide for yourself."
1,Was this supposed to be a comedy?,"Trees turn on the human race and encourage mass suicide. Really? I l-o-v-e Mark Wahlberg, but this movie sucked ad-infinitum."
2,The Happening,"At least for me, the movie was a disappointment. Just seemed to go nowhere. Just moved along and then it was over."
2,The Happening,"The Happening really fools you into believing this movie will be great. From the beginning to the end, this movie fails to deliver. There are some things in nature that we will never understand/comprehend. This movie has no real answers, no real twists and was overall unbelievable which is not much fun."
1,"Yes, it is a Black Comedy underneath the seriousness (?)","When I saw the sequence of events starting with the wind blowing the trees and then a cop shooting himself and then a driver picking up the gun and shooting himself, then a pedestrian walking by picking up the very same gun; shooting herself. Honestly, it looked like something from ""MAD TV or ""Saturday Night Live"" - absolutely comedic. Mark Wahlberg's ditzy, airhead wife was the most annoying character of all. STUNK! STUNK!The reviewers who purport to be more open-minded and forgiving of this jerk M. Night Shamalaladingdong, are the kind of people who speak in esoteric terms at parties. Whatever you guys do, never travel to Filbert, Pennsylvania. You'll meet the world's worst actors reading the world's worst script. You've been warned."
1,Horrible!!,"M. Night Shymalan totally lost it.A movie about an natural disease spread in the air that causes people to commit suicide. Mark Walberg escapes the city with his wife and the daughter of his best friend. They are chased by the disease in the air every where they go and manage to escape it. They do not die in the end because it seems the disease stops one day after it started.We do not know what the heck this disease is about! Is it nature taking revenge because humans are ruining it as it was theorized in the movie? Why did Mark Walberg and his wife not die in the end? Is it their love, or is it merely that it stopped one day after it started.We have no clue. I can't believe Shyamalan wrote and directed this film, and I can't believe Mark Walberg agreed to act in it."
1,"An inane script, horrible acting, and slited direction make this an unwatchable movie","""The Happening"" did the impossible... it made Zooey Deschanel unappealing. An inane script, horrible acting, and stilted direction make this an unwatchable movie. Mark Wahlberg's performance reminds me of the SNL skit ""Mark Wahlberg Talks to Animals"" (and I don't mean that in a good way.) I can't believe this is the same guy who wrote/directed ""The Sixth Sense."" Maybe the evil toxin from this movie soften his brain and stole his talent."
1,It's poop,"This movie was so bad it made me angry. If you watch this, you will never get those 90 minutes back. This is a bad movie, even as a rental."
1,Better not Happen again.,"By far one of the worst movies ever made. Cheesy plot, horrible concept, bad acting, bad actors, bad plants, bad grass. The only thing that would have made this movie better is if i had a noose and something to tie it to. Either that or a large caliber hand gun. I give one thumb down, and one thumb up my own A$$. I want my 2 hours and $20 bucks back."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen!!,"What can I say that 180 other reviewers that gave this 1-star haven't already said, so I'm just going to say I'll never watch another M. Night Shyamalan movie again. The Sixth Sense was a masterpiece, but it's been all down hill from there.The story, dialog and acting was just plain horrible. And what kind of ending was that????Mr. Shyamalan, you OWE ME 90 MINUTES OF MY LIFE BACK!! You should be ashamed of yourself for this movie. You're done in Hollywood."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money/Time,This is the worst movie that I have seen for a long time. Very poor story and acting. Do not waste your time or money on this film. It is not even worth the time to explain further.
1,Oh my God!,"I'll keep this short. This was possibly the worst movie I've seen this year, and I can't believe it's the director behind ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". If you heard this film sucks, and you're now thinking to yourself: It can't be that bad. Believe me it's worse than you could ever imagine."
1,"If I could, I would ask for a refund.","I just received my DVD and decided to watch it. Usually, I do not comment movies, but I had to do something to register my frustration on this one.That was an waste of 2 hours of my life and if I could, I would ask for a refund.This movie has a catch trailler... People killing themselves for nothing... wow... I have to know why they are doing that, right? so we pay to see the movie, and guess what... No answer for this question."
2,M. Night Shyamalan Has Lost His Edge!!,"Okay, I LOVED M. Night Shyamalan's movies ""The Sixth Sense"" & ""Unbreakable"" beyond words as both movies were excellent! I've been sorely disappointed with each film M. Night Shyamalan has been associated with since including ""Signs"", ""The Village"", & ""Lady in The Water""!However, M. Night Shyamalan's end of the world movie/apocalyptic film, ""The Happening"", has to be his all time worst film to date hands down. The storyline sucked, the acting was lukewarm at best and I found the majority of the characters to be annoying!! The only interesting performance was played by Betty Buckley in her role as Mrs. Jones (the isolated/crazy woman in the middle of nowhere)."
1,Bad.,"Another stinker for M. Night Shymalan to add to the growing list.Like most of his films, M. Nights's ""The Happening"" has a moment or two of real good potential but on the whole is just utter garbage. The casting is great but the script is just painful to hear, while the actors are doing their best the lines they are spouting sound so forced and out of place that you actually start to feel embarrassed for them. Listening to Wallberg's theories and phony scientific approach to things made me want to laugh and cry at the same time.I really, really suggest that you pass up this movie."
2,"M. Night Shyamalan should have left it with ""I see dead people""","Let's face it he has been going downhill ever since. However I must admit I liked ""The village."" I even bought the book that he stole the story from.This film however would have been better off as a Twilight Zone quickie. It was like the fog without the fog monsters. Unless you consider most of the actors. Shyamalan somehow must have bribed Zooey Deschanel (she was great in Tin Man) to play a ditzy pandering post hippy.The story is of people mysteriously committing suicide in unique ways. What is the cause. We get to speculat and even repent for stepping on the grass. In the end who will survive if anyone?This is one of the few films that Blu-ray scenery is more interesting than the characters or the story.Tin Man [Blu-ray]"
3,Not the worst M. Night movie,"I used to think that the director, who created ""Sixth Sense"" was a really talented guy. THEN the other movies came, each more disappointing than the previous. What is it about having ONE good movie that makes you an ABOVE the TITLE director - you know, like Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg. While he does adopt the Hitchcockian conceit of casting himself in each film, Shyamalan, although doubtless a skilled self-promoter, is nowhere near that level of filmmaker and does not deserve that level of awareness and recognition.That being said, The Happening is at least passable if entirely predictable. But I WAS able to watch the entire film (the last two turned me off by about minute 15). While there are better uses of my time, at least this one was minimally entertaining. Wahlberg fans will like it, he's not horrible in this one either"
2,sucks,this is a total waste of time. i usually like Mark Wahlberg but he just doesn't come off well as a teacher much less a science teacher....This movie just sucks.
1,Bad Acting,"Holy bad acting Batman. I tried hard to watch this movie. The first half hour, I figured it has to get better. Marky Mark (sorry Wahlberg, but you were Marky Mark in this stinker) was reading his lines. That guy from Sex In The City was reading his. And Zoey, I do love Zoey, was just plain not good in this film. There was a point at which I said, life is just too short to lose an hour and a half.I skipped ahead to the end. And the mystery here, nature self regulating, is actually a theory some people have about what might happen to man for what we have done to the planet. Sorry Shyamalan fans, I just couldn't sit through the bad acting to get the full effect of his presentation of that theory. Well I also take issue that the director chose to say Americans were first, and the threat was over. Except, wait a minute, let's pick on our real enemy - the disease hits the French in the last scene.At the very least it was filmed reasonably well."
1,piece of garbage,"I don't know if I can express in words how bad the acting is in this movie. Let me try... My kids watched Spykids 3 this afternoon and it was better acting than this movie. Very slow and pretty much went nowhere. Overall I think the movie was pretty pointless.To boot, I got charges twice for this piece of garbage. Thanks Amazon!!"
3,Its Ok - Rent something else first,"Its not his best and not his worst. I liked it more the first time I watched it, but much less the second time. It starts out thrilling but then loses steam and direction. When that happens, he throws in some disturbing imagery. Some characters are thrown in and taken out here and there. Some characters are a little too odd and/or unrealistic (overly scared army guy, plant guy and crazy lady) Honestly, I think he needed to add 15 minutes more to the movie and decided to throw in the crazy lady. The house could have been empty and it wouldn't have made a difference."
1,What's the Haps?,"Not this film. Goofy title (where are the Supremes?). Should have been called Taking Care of Jess, since that's what the characters mostly talk about... Wahlburg doesn't talk when he meets a old lady in the middle of nowhere? Hello, script writer, editor."
2,the nothing,"This should be called the nothing.Nothing kills people.You can step it up,buy the blueray,and have a better picture of nothing."
1,So plants can think?,"When this movie started out I thought it might be good then it kept going downhill from there.I think the worst part of it was the storyline.I get that we better take better care of the planet but you MNS,ought to take better care of your audience.Some of us can think!Plants with brains?They know that we humans are the ones responsible for what is happening to them.I think not,they would only respond to the waste that is causing this.They would not know who is putting it there.Oh maybe it is nature,then again that would mean nature has a consciousness and can think and reason.I do not know how any of the actors could give a decent performance with stupidity like this."
4,A Minority,"Apparently, I'm in the minority here, but I thought it was brilliant. M. Night has an excellent way of delivering material that is actually original. This was a story that hasn't been told and retold a thousand times before.The pacing was wonderful and speculative element unique. I would highly recommend that viewers give it a try and develop their own opinion. M. Night is not a splatterpunk director and doesn't try to be just like everyone else making ""scary"" movies.I have enjoyed all his movies, all the way back to ""The Sixth Sense"" and beyond. I look forward to more."
2,It IS as bad as most of the reviews say!,"Say what you will,but I am a fan of Mark Wahlberg so I usually try to see all his movies. Same goes for John Leguizamo. The opposite is now the case for M. Night Shyamalan. With the exception of The Sixth Sense, I agree that his movies have gotten more lame culminating in this one.I don't care about the money spent, I want my two hours back."
1,a really stupid movie,It started out okay but then it just got really stupid when it came down to the plants are out to get us crap! If you haven't seen these movie then you are not missing a thing!
1,The only thing shocking was that noone walked out of the theatre,"I saw this in the movie theater. The best actors in the movie are the tv reporters, the most shocking thing about seeing this movie was that noone walked out of the theater, wahlberg was so pathetic and horrible i guess noone could look away. Shamalan owes around 30 dollars, 10 for the village, 10 for lady in the water and 20 for the happening, gas money and popcorn included. If i ever meet him, i will ask for my 30 dollars. How does he keep getting movies?"
1,What were you thinking?,"Mark Wahlberg what were you thinking? M. Night Shyamalan what were you thinking? This one is just terrible. No script, horrible acting, no meaningful plot...just an embarrassment to the director and to Mark. The best part of the film is the artwork on the box...dead cars on a lonely highway. Maybe that's what this should have been entitled. Avoid at ALL cost. I paid 1 cent (plus shipping) for this one and I still feel like I was totally ripped off. I can't believe how bad this film was. All I will remember is a wind machine blowing the leaves on trees...this one probably cost $500 to make...and that includes the special effects. Shyamalan needs to hang it up...Wahlberg is much too good for this garbage. I gave it ONE star because I couldn't give it a ZERO! I feel like there was more depth in this review by me, than the entire script by M. Night. GOODNIGHT M. Night. I'll never give your future films another chance. You truly laid a rotten egg with this one."
1,Why did trees and grass decide to attack groups of people,"Not a very good movie nor anything really scary. The opening scene showed some promise and the slight scary music did a little. But grass, wind and blowing trees does not a good spooky film make. In one scene our hero even talked to the wind and seemed to be granted a pardon or at least time. Ya right! Also, the non-ending and the unexplained reasons for plants and tree to attack man nor the ending with the spread to another continent left to much unexplained in a movie without purpose. Sorry, but this movie is a waste."
3,MORE THOUGHT PROVOKING THAN SCARY!,"I had pretty low expectations of this film before I sat down to watch it, but after seeing it, I think it's better than some have stated in their reviews. I have to give this film some credit because even though there isn't much happening on the surface in 'The Happening', it's an intriguing idea and I found myself interested throughout it's 90 minute running length.I think most viewer's were expecting a different film. The story is fairly interesting, but that doesn't mean it's without it's flaws. It's not really as original as it seems as there have been tons of ""nature strikes back"" films and the performances aren't all that memorable, but it's worth a look if you have enough patience to sit through it."
2,M.Wahlberg played in THIS?,"This was an OKAY movie... definately a rental. I was sort of entertained watching it the first time, but I definately don't need it for my movie collection. Ok movie, ok storyline, ok actors (even though I love MW!)"
2,What happened ?,"What happened ? What happened ?If you were a Malaysian, and you understood Malay, the title of the movie should be called ""The PENING"" instead of ""the hapPENING""....LOL....."
3,Not as terrible as you've heard,"This thriller got a bum rap. It's decently scary, imaginative, and darkly funny. Some of the lines are real groaners, but other lines are funny, and I mean deliberately so. Sometimes the characters' behavior seems maddeningly unrealistic and you find yourself shouting, ""They would never do that!"" at the screen, but I've seen worse movies. Heck, this director alone has made at least two worse movies."
2,It is just ok,"When you freeze the disc, it is hard to fit back under the cup. The cup is too deep for normal items that you would dip. If you fill it incorrectly cup can become wedged in the top."
4,Hanes Pure Bliss Microfiber Unlined Underwire Bra,"I sure wish bras came in cotton these days. I'm not real thrilled with microfiber, as it bunches up a little, which can show through clothing. BUT, I can't stand padding, which this bra doesn't have. I also don't like lace. I just want it plain, thin, with an underwire and no bulky straps. This bra is all of that. I ordered more, since my criteria is hard to find."
1,New Sizing or What?,I've been the same bra size for the last ten years. How come when I order a bra online it would barely fit around my middle and cover me? Cost me six dollars to return it and learn that I will not order undergarments online ever again.
5,Complete Great Recordings,Roberto Carlos is the ultimate romantic. His songs charm the hearts of many in love with love. The ones included in this collection are his greatest and most famous ones. It's immaculate.
2,Poor CD,This CD was in horrible condition. The plastic was broken. I would have returned it but I lost the packagae. I would not recommend it. It put me to sleep.
2,Nice leather but difficult to handle,It's very difficult to use this case. You have to pull the phone out everytime you get a call. Also if you are driving and you get a call it is impossible to get the phone out with one hand. The connecting srew looses on it's own and my phone fell off twice from it.The leather used is excellent quality but overall it's below average.
4,"Good case, but not on belt","I purchased this after seeing it online at another site and thought it look stylish and professional. And when it arrived, it was.The case makes all the features easily accessible and does not block them. (phone, power, sync, etc.) It does it good at protecting it too. I learned the hard way however with this.I had the phone for just under a week and the belt clip attachment came loose and fell off-dropping my phone from my hip. I about had a heart attack! But the case did a good job protecting it, but I'm still a little mad about the clip falling off. I would recommend not using it to be honest. Save yourself some stress. The phone also blocks the ""home"" and ""options button"" a little. Kind of annoying, but you get over it.Overall I've been please."
4,Elegant design with one minor flaw,"I've had this case for years and love the way it looks and quality of the leather but only one flaw to report. If flip is open, your Treo might slip off the top of the cover, so keep this in mind and enjoy your Covertec Flip Case."
3,received timely and well packaged,"have not read this entire book, as yet...I bought to give to someone else who is getting married next year"
3,SCARY NOW,"I have the Australian cardboard pouch version of this single. The LP edit is ok but the remixes are not funky or fat. The'Love to Infinity Walk in the Park' remix features disturbing sounds of children squealing while playing 'at the park' but the effect is unpleasant and does nothing to make MJ seem a 'nice guy'. The music video is shocking and features Michael grabbing his crotch repeatedly while parading before topless 10 year old boys who are playing drums. This single and video were a bad move for Michael and he has a guilty look on his face on the Cover Art. A disturbing chapter in the book of bizarreness that is enough to make real fans question their loyalty. Still a must have for any real collection but not one you will listen to much and that music video is also shocking and bizarre and not one I like. But we always wanted Michael to be as shocking and bizarre as possible, he has not disappointed us."
5,Truly the Very Best of,"If you are a fan of the great George Howard then this album is for you. It is loaded with all the hits me and my friends partied to during the heyday of Modern/Contemporary/ Fusion/holding my nose ""Smooth Jazz"". It brings back a lot of memories of those times. After tiring of the current crop of Smooth Jazz artists I decided to go back in time to see if the songs I loved so much were still relevant and to no ones surprise, They are! From Joe Sample to Alex Bugnon and David Sandborn their music more than holds up th today's light and sometimes fluffy jazz. Thanks for the memories and good times George."
4,Good exercise mp3 player.,"This product has been great and worth the price. Once I bought the psa220, I downloaded to the updates from the website and read the instructions and have had NO problems. Downloading music onto the MP3 player is easy, deleting and replacing songs is easy.....excellent product. The armband is comfortable and the stopwatch works great. I haven't had the need to use the radio, so I don't know about that. The headphones work well and has good sound quality (I'm using this for exercise, not for a home theatre experience).Overall, a good product worth recommending."
1,MAC users beware,"First of all let me say that the design of this MP3 player is very nice - the hardware is thoughtfully designed and the built in stopwatch and strobe light are great for running.The 1 star rating is because of the software - MAC users beware! The box clearly states support for MAC OS 10 but the software that ships with this player is archaic! It is very non-intuitive and extremely buggy. I had multiple software freezes, system freezes and never successfully downloaded a song. I'm baffled as to how Nike/Phillips actually released this to the public. After 4 hours of fighting I finally gave up - NO gadget should be this frustrating to get up and running. Returned the item and got an iRiver instead and had it fully up and working with downloaded songs in <20 minsSorry Nike/Philips, I really wanted to like this product but you need to go back to the drawing board on your software."
1,JUNK,Ive owned all of the Philips/Nike mp3 players...not because I need to have the latest and greatest but becuase they kept dying on me. The software was a pain to use (especially since im using itunes now which is VERY EASY).The only reason I stuck with the player is because I bought the extended warranty from Best Buy (if you buy this player you NEED the warranty) and they would replace it with a newer model.I made the switch to the ipod nano a year ago and havent looked back. Do yourself a favor and avoid this player like the plague. Phillips and Nike no longer have a partnership due to the poor performance of this player.
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS! I never even used it before it ""broke""!","As a runner, I thought this would be a good purchase. I even took my un-used Ipod back before opening the Ipod because I thought this item would be better -- I was WRONG! During my first run the product fell on the concrete and never turned back on again. Philips would not replace it because they said I ""misused"" it. Philips demonstrated extremely poor customer service and I found no help when I contacted the seller from Amazon. Don't waste your money on this or any other product from Philips!"
5,Beautiful Book,"Mexico: A higher vision, is a book for all people. Whether or not you have been to Mexico the photographs alone are astonishing. The book portrays a beautiful country giving writen details about different sections of the country along with some historical facts and myths. For those who have been there it is a sweet reminder of the culture. From the past to the present. It gives photos of the old and the new and how they mix together. Definately a must have."
4,What a great pillow!!!,"I bought one, as it was on-sale, and it looked cute. It was larger than I thought, and I actually loved it. I bought 4 more as gifts for my girlfriends, who have been with me through my love life ups and downs.... as I through theirs. Everybody could use a hug, and these pillows are so huggable. Love it. I would have given it 5 stars if it had some sort of washable pillow case..."
4,Very soft accent pillow,"This pillow (like the shocking pink version) is a nice accent piece for a girl's room. It doesn't hold its shape all that well, however, and it can't be cleaned (the cover isn't removable). The list price of $20 is patently ridiculous, but at Amazon's current price it's not a bad deal."
5,Mogu Medium Pink Heart,I sent the red heart to my 2 year old granddaughter for Valentine's day last year. She loved it so much that this year I ordered the pink one for her and the red one for her little sister. The Mogu pillows are much softer than off brands. I also gave one to a friend who had breast cancer surgery and she thinks EVERYONE who has this surgery needs one of these pillows for pure comfort cushioning following surgery. It really helped her sleep more comfortably with it tucked under her arm. AND the price on Amazon.com was cheaper than the sale prices in the department stores in my area!
5,PURCHASED 8 OF THEM!!!!,"I JUST GOT MY PILLOWS IN PINK AND RED AND SENT SOME OUT AS GIFTS.THE PILLOWS DO HOLD THEIR HEART SHAPE, NOT LIKE SOMEONE SAID THAT THEY LOOSE THE SHAPE. I SQUISHED IT AND SQUASHED IT AND IT STILL LOOKED LIKE A HEART. IM SO HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE. PILLOWS ARE VERY SOFT I COULDNT STOP SQUEEZING THEM..."
5,Tobin Learns to Make Friends,"Diane, I gave Tobin to my student over summer vacation. I spent time with him recently and his comments to me were, ""Let's go to the Tobin library and get some more books"". Please Diane give us some more Tobin books!!!"
5,Tobin Learns to Make Friends,"""Tobin Learns to Make Friends"" is a great book for all children! I have a son with Aspergers syndrome and this book was a great tool in helping him learn about making friends. This book has also been a great tool for helping my two other boys understand the struggles their brother goes through. It is the best book I have found in helping teach social skills as well. I highly recommend this book for all children!"
5,This episode is the CLASSIC! Fall down on the floor funny!,"""Promotion,"" aka ""Letter To The Boss"" is my all time favorite Honeymooners and for good reason! Some great moments here! Jackie's soliloquy after mistakenly thinking he was fired (""working holidays and weekends, crabbly old ladies, drunks getting on without paying their fare-I'll NEVER get another GOOD job like this again!""). Jackie's letter to the boss ""You dirty bum!"" (To which Art/Norton adds, ""Nice touch!). Best of all, Jackie's eye-popping when his boss reads the letter and his resulting gymnastics. If you can sit still while watching this, something is WRONG with you!"
4,Toy Fox Terrier (Kennel Club Dog Breed Series,"This was a very well put together book with lots of good information. My only dissapointment is that it seemed a bit too generic - not breed specific. Its as if the words ""toy fox terrier"" were inserted with the same info used with other dogs and other books."
2,V02max values for whom?,"I give this book only 2 stars because, while it does have detailed training programs, it does not account for the variability of V02max levels due to age and gender. So most of the charts are useless for me. For example, the books states that an 'inactive but healthy adult might have a VO2max of about 31..(ml/kg/min)';however, according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), for someone of my age and gender 31 ml/kg/min would be about 70%!(There seems to be a mumber of other testing protocols that give different VO2max values from those used by ACSM. So I wonder if, given such variability in tests, outcomes and interpretation, whether any VO2max test is useful.)"
3,"""Possessed"" is Unprepossessing","Here is another musical version of the Bram Stoker novel ""Dracula"". The music on this recording is fun at times, but uneven. Some songs have a contempory pop feel, others are more appropriate to the Victorian story. Renfield's song, ""Love Sucks"" is a rock number. It is the most memorable song on the cd, but is very out of place in this recording. I have reviewed other Dracula recordings and I will say the same thing about ""Possessed"": If you love different versions of Dracula, this cd is worth adding to your collection. Otherwise, it is quite forgetable."
4,a great read,"Eternity is a refreshing read.It is a heartwarming story that teaches us about forgiveness acceptance and love.Staci books has a way to reach your heart strings.At one point in the story drew told harmony she was not in love with him but merely the idea of him. that struck out to me because there are times when we settle and the one we really love may never find out because of fear.There are some valuable lesson within the pages of eternity that though you may read this book to unwind after a long day at work,you would leave all the more wiser and you certainly would not be disappointed."
5,Wonderful Family Drama,"I saw an episode by accident one day and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I saw the first season on Amazon Instant Video, I ordered the season. I had never used Instant Video, easy and worked beautiful on my MAC. I loved each episode. It is a FAMILY drama that has a key character in Amy a teen. But don't be discouraged, it intertwines all members of the family and friends. I especially enjoyed the story line with Jack (the grandfather)starting a romance. So few shows today show adult characters and their life changes. The beautiful backdrop is a bonus. I may have to visit the Canadian Rockies.Please come out with Season Two on Instant Video! It may give me the incentive to look into Prime Membership.The show is hard to find in the states."
5,Very realistic horse tv show!,"I love this show! I wish the seasons were cheaper. but they are worth it. The horses are beautiful and the actors are very good at interacting with them. It's all realistic. I love the show because it is enjoyable for everyone. Not just teenagers, my mom watches the show with me. It's one of the only good horse shows on tv. WildFire was a great show until it ended. So other than Heartland I don't know any horse shows on tv. Which upsets me greatly. I have been around and riding horses since I was 2 years old. Since my family and I have owned numerous horses. Right now I am taking care of nine. So I'm very glad to watch a show that is so real."
5,Heartland 1st season,"I love this show, but have not had a chance to watch this yet. I received it on time and I believe in good condition. I will know more after I have a chance to play it."
5,Most Wonderful Series,We are so extremely impressed with the Heartland series it is impossible to stop watching it once you start watching it. Good Clean entertainment. All of our grandchildren love this show.
5,Love it!,This show is fantastic. It's the best wholesome/family show I've seen in a loooong time. I would gladly pay for the other seasons. The per episode price is a bit steep though. Need the option to buy the whole season at a discount.
5,Excellent Family Series,"The Heartland series is so wonderful! Intelligent, thought provoking, and can be viewed by the entire family. My grandchildren love the stories and anticipate me buying the next season! They adore horses and this series plays them up big! Thanks for carrying these excellent DVD's.By Dahlink Grandmother of 5 beautiful girls"
4,slight package damage but + overall,I purchased this for a gift. But when it came the packaging was damaged so I had to opens the dvd box to make sure the discs were not damaged. The box was slightly damaged but the discs appeared unharmed. I have not heard anything negative from the person I gifted it to so I assume they are working ok. I was a bit embarrassed to give a gift that I had unsealed but I explained it. This one time event would not stop me from ordering from amazon again. I like the sight and I enjoy shopping with them.
1,Great Series; Useless DVD Quality,"Love the series, and happy to find a good price on Amazon. But the pilot I bought did not work, only some of the first seasons DVDs, and some of the second seasons. Haven't even bothered with the third. I brought them to China, and it would cost more than I lost to mail them back."
4,Pleasant is a Positive Attribute,"Is Heartland predictable? Sure. Is it subtle? Not at all. It is a little corny? Maybe even more than a little. It is, however very pleasant to watch. The scenery is bucolicaly beatiful. The cinematography does justice to the scenery. The characters are not at all complex but theay are all wholesomely attractive. It's not Cherries Jubilee but sometimes a bowl of vanilla pudding with whipped cream will do just fine."
5,MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT,"MY DAUGHTER LOVED THIS SO MUCH, SHE NOW HAS SEASONS 2, 3 AND 4 AND WANTING SEASON 5 FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR..."
3,Great Product but Misleading,On the picture on the box I assumed this lollipop was round and looked like cotton candy but it is a flat lollipop.It has a great taste but the pictures are misleading.
3,My Slim Jim Jerky purchase,"Good Jalapeno flavor, spicy but not to hot ! Beef was a little too dry ! Some packages seemed to be a little short on content thou ! Worth the price i paid but not sure if its worth $3.99 a bag."
4,great stuff,"this is a high protein, low cal, low fat and low carb snack. the jalapeno flavor gives it some kicks... better than the original/ non spicy flavor."
5,Amazingly complete and accuarte,"It's not the main bands covered in the book that amaze me so much. One would expect the likes of The Yardbirds, Cream, etc to be covered but the more obscure bands that deserve some recognition finally get some in this superb book. The Black Cat Bones (with members of Free) The Downliners Sect (great 'unknowns' from The U.K.) Aynsley Dunbar's Retaliation all get their due along with many more. The discographies are the most accurate I've ever seen and the clever 'Postscripts' at the end of each chapter let us know the history of the band members after they departed their respective groups. This is one you need to buy!"
4,Great foundational book for homeschoolers,"I am happy with the structure and content of this workbook and many of the other grade level books by this publisher; I used them in first and second grade with my son and plan to do the same with my daughter.I piece together my curriculum from lots of different sources, using this publisher as my primary source for geography, math, spelling and language. I will agree that there is some ""busy work"" that does not really help develop spelling skills, so we often skip those sections. I would also like a quarterly review/quiz activity to help reinforce things."
2,better suited to kindergarden,"My son is using this book as part of his 1st grade curriculum. It is foolishly easy; he is not an especially advanced reader (middle of his class), but can complete the final lessons in the book without effort ... as of the first month of 1st grade. This book would work well for a kindergardner or possibly a 4yo with an aptitude for reading / spelling. It is truly useless for a 1st grade curriculum."
3,Only 2 receivers,"Does not fit all the devices. I mean, it carries 5 microphones but not the 5 receivers."
3,Sadly inaccurate,"This book could be a fun read but the small part about my family is laughably incorrect and left out perhaps the juiciest fodder: my mother was having an affair with and subsequesntly married our next door neighbor. How I wish the author had picked up the phone or walked the couple hundred yards over to the house; we'd have been happy to set the record straight. My Mom died in March, and contrary to the author's assertion, I am very much alive."
1,What were they thinking?,"OK... I'll give them this: the scenery with the temples and such was nice to look at, but the script was awful, the acting was awful, and the whole thing just ...stank. I asked Blockbuster for my money back.Six of us watched the movie and we all were left dumbfounded that anybody even funded this boondoggle. I think my dog could write a better script.If I could possibly give this movie ""0"" stars, I would."
2,2.5 STARS FOR EFFORT,"Matt Dillon co-wrote the script and co-stars in his directing debut, about Jimmy Cremins (Dillon), a con artist under investigation by the feds who flees to Cambodia to collect his share of an insurance scam. He eventually meets up with Marvin (James Caan), his mentor and partner in crime, also uncovering a mysterious and dangerous world that could prove to be his undoing. Unfortunately, the only intriguing aspect of CITY OF GHOSTS involves the often rare glimpses into the remote and exotic culture and landscape of Cambodia. Aside from the cinematography this film has little to offer the audience, besides some laughs from Gérard Depardieu's character. The dialogue and acting are often uneven and scripted and the relationships between the characters are not convincing.Bottom line: I was disappointed in CITY OF GHOSTS..."
3,"Very average movie, beautiful cinematography","I think the worst thing I could say is that this movie reminds me of ""Wild Things"" and comes up short. Really! There are a couple of scenes and plot devices that seem to be lifted from ""Wild Things"". Overall average plot, average script (a couple of times I winced at very cliche lines) but the cinematography was beautiful. That was actually one of the things that brought me to this movie. I've been to both Cambodia (and Thailand for that matter) and they captured the sweat, grime and chaos of Phnom Penh but forgot all the lizards and other critters you encounter."
2,"Dry ""new"" HP 56 Cartridge","The cartridge came quickly but has been opened and it was dry. Warm water bath got it working, but it should never have been sold as ""new""."
1,no show,"never received the item, e-mail you, wrote a review before never heard from anyone, had to buy item at the store even.so i won,t buy anything on line any more"
1,Not compatable!,Was supposed to be compatable with my HP 1210 and was not. Had to buy HP brand. Would not buy again.
1,hp 56 ink cartridge,"I ordered a HP 56 ink cartridge and got a no name brand refurbished or whatever they call it - was not what I ordered. I had to request they send me a shipping label as I did not need to pay for shipping. They sent me that thru e-mail and said they had since ""pulled"" the ad on Amazon."
1,Suspicious,I'd be really surprised if what I received was a real new HP cartridge. The quality of the black when printing just isn't there and the contact points on the cartridge looked corroded. I guess I'm the fool for buying the cheapest one I could find on Amazon.
4,Ink Cartridge for Printer,The cartridges have fully met the needs of printing in every way. Both black and white and color copies have met and/or exceeded my expectations. The price was very competitive and even provided a savings. Thanks for your service.
1,"cartridge is fine, but not worth the hassle!","the ink jett cartridge is fine...but I would not order it again! First, the order was duplicated and the charge doubled out of my checking account...with no explanation. Returning info was confusing...I ended up returning it to amazon.com and am STILL waiting for my credit. It has been over 6 weeks now. I would gladly pay Staples their inflated price, rather than go throough this again!"
4,I Need You and you came through,"I regreted not getting this single when it came out way back when on the singles rack at Tower Records (yes) when Tower Records was still around. Love the Radio Mix, when I heard it on the video I had to get it. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy the album version but this is more upbeat and danceable, it has more layers of sounds to fill in the emptiness the original lacks. The drums are hard and crisp, bassline has more character and depth."
4,Fresh new Jazz Trio,"Piano:Sai GhoseBass:Jerry WilfongDrums:Mike ConnorsThis is a refreshingly swinging album performed by the Sai Ghose Trio. The music is a collection of well known standards as well as several originals played in a quaint, contomporary, and innovative manner. Ghose plays simple and insightful phrases that fill the music with delight. An album that compares well with many other well known Jazz trios today, I personally reccomend this album to anyone who enjoys a Jazz trio line-up.P.s.:Don't let the title of the album deceive you--this is basically straight foward Jazz, not Indian music."
3,So-So Stanwyck Fare,"This was one of only 5 minor projects Stanwyck committed to in the emotionally turbulent year following her divorce from Frank Fay. It proved a solid box office hit, but it hasn't aged gracefully. The movie begins with snappy promise: Stanwyck is a disillusioned bride whose new husband can't afford to support her in the manner to which she is accustomed. Enter a charming and very eligible drunk in the form of Robert Young. Unfortunately, the movie veers sharply away from any interesting developments in order to chastise Stanwyck - and every woman - for entertaining the least notion of dissatisfaction with a borderline-abusive spouse. A wife's proper place, afterall, is in the home, even if that home is no more than a squalid rat hole and the husband a bore and a boor. For roles far more worthy of her sparkling talents, check out THE LADY EVE and BALL OF FIRE and CHRISTMAS IN CONNECTICUT."
2,Sorry Richard,"Despite its 120-plus pages, this book takes about 15 minutes to read. While it offers a handful of ideas worth considering, it isn't worth the cover price. If Richard Hatch were not the winner of the first Survivor, this work would have been published on a personal Web site somewhere and that would be all. If you want it, buy it used."
1,1 Survival Secret For Rich,"DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB! Rich Hatch ought to be grateful he won the million dollars on the hit TV show, Survivor, because given this piece of drivel he calls a book, his future as a writer is bleak at best. He's lucky they never had an immunity challenge that involved writing or editing because he surely would have been the first one voted off the island. I'd rather read a book by Sonja (the first Survivor castaway voted off the island), whose inspiring story of surviving cancer would offer more valuable lessons than this delusional, muddled, mess of a pamphlet by a self important ""know it all""."
5,A Must Read for Survivor and Rich Hatch Fans,"101 Survival Secrets is a great, entertaining read--one that will surely appeal to fans of both Survivor and its million dollar winner, Rich Hatch. Part autobiography, part self-help, and part photo-log, this book shows you exactly how Rich Hatch went from being a miserable 360 pound loser to a trim, happy millionaire, and offers 101 invaluable tips to help you achieve this same sort of happiness yourself. The book is well designed and easy to follow, and surprisingly well written to boot. Rich's advice is solid. Take it. Highly recommended."
2,More Fluffer from which to Suffer the Puffer,"I was anxious to write this self-help/autobiography/shameless self-promotional piece off as an attempt to cash in on the fifteen minutes of fame awarded by the Survivor phenomenon. However, I got to tell you, this book not only contained alterable ideas for everyone but also inspired me to peruse its pages in the buff. Thank you Richard Hatch for liberating so many parts of myself."
2,No Inside Info.,"I was given this book by a friend who recognizes my passion for Survivor. I applied for both Survivor1 and Survivor2. I plan to apply for any subsequent Survivor shows. I am constantly looking for any insight that would help me improve my chances of being selected in an increasingly competitive process. So when I received this book I started reading, eagerly searching for any little tidbit of information that might help me with the next Survivor application process. However, I was sorely disappointed. The book is a bunch of quasi-psycho babble. A total waste of money for any true Survivor Fan. Also, check out my review of Burnett's first book. I am currently reading the second one and will post a review soon."
1,Good but not good enough,"I bought this book, because I tought it is good for learning AutoCad 3D. I have to say this is the second book I read from this Author. Authough not as boaring as the first one, this book may help you only if you have been working many years as an architect. But the biggest problem is that you have to type step by step commands and numbers all the time. Why you have to do the next step is never explain, so if you stop to follow the book and decide to do something on your onw, you can't do it.Another problem is that you can't save your work because the book comes with copywrite cd so if you want to stop and continue later you have 2 options: either never to turn off the program or to finish few chapters at once.So as a sumary I must say another Big, Bad and Boaring Book."
4,Charm bracelet,"I have a lot of compliments Everytime I wear this bracelet. I am happy with the colors, the beads. I love it."
5,A must-have for any DNA criminalist or criminal lawyer,"I have a BS in genetics and biochemistry and am looking to enter into a forensics lab. This book is an EXCELLENT resource for an entry-level criminalist, criminal lawyer, or the non-scientist interested in this topic. It was organized from basic genetics to higher-level interpretation issues and included tons of diagrams, pictures, and relevant case studies. This book did an outstanding job explaining complicated and detailed subject matter in an easy to understand and interesting matter."
1,What you see it NOT what you get,"I order this item thinking (silly me) that I was going to get what was in the picture. No, they sent the speedometer for the Power Ball. How many people want that? Why don't they show a picture of the speedometer instead of the picture of the Power Ball (that I thought I was ordering)? Even the description talks about how great the Power Ball is, and only briefly mentions that you can add a speedometer if you wish. I will now try to return it, at my cost I'm guessing, but given the deceptive listing my hopes are not high that it will go smoothly. Consider yourself warned."
4,summer comfort,I have enjoyed wearing Clark shoes for years. This shoes is another great Clark product. Thank you
3,"Nice shoe, but pricey.","This is a fairly nice shoe, with moderate comfort. It is easy to slip on, but not as ""cushy"" as I had hoped. Overall, I am pleased with the shoe, but thought it was a little high priced considering the lack of comfort."
5,"Comfort, cool, class.","Love these shoes. They are too cute! They look great with capris, shorts, summer dresses, and this may sould odd but they seem to love and cradle your feet. They come in different colors, so you should be able to find the pair for you."
4,Old but still worth it!,"I've had copies of this little volume for years and although its content shows its age it's still a very useful approach to writing resumes... er... ""Qualifications Briefs!""There is a sample QB that is particularly useful for people who have been stay-at-home parents for sometime and have been out of the workforce for awhile. Good stuff!"
1,"All cheap plastic, key didn't fit well, I returned it.","When I got this it was difficult to extract the key, and not easy to insert it either. Then the key turned roughly. Even after a little Dupont Teflon lube it didn't work smoothly. The lugs and internal components are plastic. I don't trust it, and don't want want to see it break while I have an empty tank at a gas station in the sticks at night, so I returned it. I'll pay up for a Motorcraft part from Ford."
3,Bit awkward to unlock but fits like a glove,Having no experience with other brands of locking gas cap I cannot say whether my difficulty unlocking it is due to my own clumsiness or the design of my vehicle's fuel door area. This cap fits GREAT and does NOT cause the check engine light to come on. The price was great too. I would recommend not putting the key on your key ring but instead keeping it in the center console. As disconnecting the speedometer cable is not difficult on many vehicles this is a good way to monitor the fuel level to see if your teen is sneaking out your car ;-)
1,It Broke After One Week-First Time to Unlock It!!,"This POS gas cap broke after one week of use. My wife called me from the gas station griping that she could not get it off. I told her how to unlock it, and like a normal husband, I told her that she was crazy! I told her to come home with the truck.I had a devil of a time getting it off. The lock was broken and this was the first time that she tried to unlock it. I tested it when we got it and it worked, so I was more than a little surprised that it was broken.I have a Stant on my vehicle and I hope that it works better than this one."
5,Pyle PLBQ12 Sub-Woofer,"This unit is sold to be used in a car but I purchased it to augment the low-end of a small PA system that I have. It has worked very well for that use. I power it with a 150 watt amp. I use a crossover so that it only produces frequencies below 125 hz. It is a true sub-woofer and produces a full sounding low end in small areas. Had I attempted this with a true ""PA"" sub-woofer, I would have had 4 times the money in it. Keep in mind this product was purchased and delivered to my door for less than $60. For the money, I am very pleased with this product."
2,You get what you pay for...,"Among the sea of 12"" subwoofers, this has to be one of the worst I've heard. There is no low bass extension beyond 50 hz, even when crossed over and powered by a 250 watt rms amp... and the plastic faceplate of the box wobbles horribly, making a terrible rattle sound even when tightening down the screws. A complete waste of time and money. Do yourself a favor and spend at least a hundred bucks or so on a 12"" sub that works, otherwise you'll be left with a nice, carpeted end table."
2,Cheap is what it is,I had seen that it had good reviews so i bought it and i liked it till i turned it up. i had a 800 watt amp so i was pushin it but i was surprised how easly it ate it. i didnt even have it turned up all that loud. i recomend that if you buy this get a 600 watt amp dont go over cuz it will kill the speaker.
5,So fun!,"I wore these fishnet pantyhose in a musical production of Little Shop of Horrors. They suited my character of Audrey and held up beautifully for all 5 performances!They are super comfortable and definitely more durable than I expected. I did manage to snag these hose slightly with my ring, but it was easily ""fixed"" (unlike regular nylons)and unnoticeable with just a little hairspray! These nylons are awesome!I just wish I could be Audrey EVERYDAY!"
5,Delicious!,"If reading graphic ... scenes that will get your juices flowing is your thing, read on. Although there is a lot of repetitively descriptive terminology, the book is definitely a good one! It was written for pure sensual/... enjoyment! I would like to find more books written by this particular anonymous author!!"
1,Kept trying but gave up!,"This is the most disgusting thing I've ever read, with the continuous incest and orgies! I can understand the purpose of these sexually explicit scenes being spattered throughout a novel but it is the ENTIRE NOVEL. Seriously, there is no story line to this piece of junk reading. I really gave it way more effort than I should have. I read 1/3 of the book but just can't do it anymore! I kept thinking once he gets past his sexual memoirs there would begin a true story but it just goes on and on with all the detailed & deviant sexual encounters. I hope this ""author"" learned that if you continuously write about sex it really detracts from the sensuality of the scene and becomes disgusting if not boring to read! A little bit goes a long way with a reader's imagination but nothing was left to the reader's imagination in this book and I gave up looking for a storyline. Done with this one before I could get to a plot!"
4,You'd have to be a doorknob to be not aroused by this,"Oh my! If you are needing a boost in the arousal department and respond to the written word, this is your book. Just be sure to have a willing partner (or a reasonable facsimile!) at the ready!There is something incredibly exciting in the 'oh by the way' events and couplings described.There is a sterility and generic blandness to a lot of contemporary erotica (porn), especially for women. This book (and its cousins), make you feel like a voyeur to these juicy, earthy encounters in times associated with primness (although in reality those times were anything but).And I just love the title..."
1,Disgusting,"I am open minded but I wasn't prepared for this, definitely not my taste. It has EVERYTHING , incest, anal , groups, same sex (both sexes), pedophilia....I guess this is the result of Victorian restrictions is so many other facets of life."
2,disturbing,very strange and disturbing! i didn't the mind language but when he took his young sisters virginity i couldn't read any more. yuck
2,Better quality control needed,"These discs appear to be well made and they have done the exterior plywood (T-111 without grooves) paint removal/feathering job about as well as can be expected, however somewhere in the middle of the pack the discs didn't seem to have enough of the fuzzy hook and loop media on them and would not hold onto the backing pad. Some flew off after less than a minute of use. This continued even with replacement of the backing pad (but the new backing pad did help somewhat at least for a while). As a result, a lot of the sanding capability of the discs was wasted. This is doubly unfortunate because the ability of the Bosch ROS 20VS sander backing pads to hold on to sanding discs appears to be a weak link in otherwise excellent products. The hook & loop ""grip"" fades too quickly."
1,Usually ships in 1-2 months...,"""Usually ships in 1-2 months."" You must be kidding!!!Bosch SR5R045 5"" Hook & Loop Sanding Disc, 8-Hole, Red, 40 Grit 50 Pack"
3,Better than Farewell Concert but what else is there?,"Musical group films are spotty. Not too many capture the excitement or thrill of a live concert let alone the first time a group really catches your attention. The directors perhaps try too hard & miss the point in the process? Most run like wannabe ""rockumentaries"". Can't say this is a must have film, but considering the lack of any other footage in print for this group ... I suppose it is a must have, at least for 25+ years fans of the group. At least there wasn't any ooozzing lava-lamp antics like those in the Farewell Concert!"
5,The Making of Fresh Live Cream,"I just signed on to ALO & found the reviews for my video version of ""Fresh Live Cream"" - delighted that you guys liked it, can't tell you how extraordinary it was for me to make the video, find the lost footge & clear the band - God was totaly on my case for that one - I also make a TV verson, including 2 x tracks from Hall Of Fame Reunion, which I prefer to the video as more narrative, the distrbutors decided to release DVD without my knowledge, which is a shame as I would have added loads of more stuff - anyway it was fun & one day I will recut my own multimedia version to tell more of the 'true' story. Peace & Love. Martin Baker"
2,Poor Cinematography,"The cinematography almost ruins this video. About eighty percent of the footage has the camera all of two feet from Jack Bruce's face. There is almost no footage of Clapton, except in the background and out of focus. It is almost better to just listen to this video than to watch it. The interviews are informative and interesting (except for Ginger Baker, who took way too much acid). The songs were well selected and most are full length. All in all it is entertaining the first time you watch it, but ceases to be so during repeat viewing."
3,Don't expect to see Clapton play a lot.,"The footage is good but camera mainly focuses on Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker, Clapton is usually in the background. A bit of a pain when you hear Eric playing but only see Jack or Ginger, ugh. Good if you need the historical/documentary value. In the meantime play Live at Hyde Park, Unplugged, 24 nights or Live at Montserrat for your Clapton fix."
5,"Album equally as ""Sweet and Strange""","This album is certainly eclectic. There are so many different sounds, all of which have pleased everyone i have played this CD for.This album has radio-quality sound and powerful lyrics all in one. I cannot decide which is my favourite song because each time I listen, I like them all more and more. I find myself singing along in my room, in the car, and even in the library.I can be sure of one thing though, Pinsker is making her way around campus. This album is like chocolate: you just cant get enough of it!"
4,This is a collection of PRIMARY documents,"I am writing this review to make sure that people know that this is a collection of PRIMARY sources. Since there are no editorial reviews posted on Amazon, I assumed that this book was a collection of articles by contemporaries DEBATING history. In any case, although this book wasn't what I was looking for, it seems very substantive as far as primary sources go. It also seems like it is directed more at history teachers looking for teaching materials.Contains articles (written by historical figures from John Winthrop to Thomas Jefferson to Frederick Douglass) about the original English colonization, the question of Native Americans, Puritans and religious tolerance, the Revolutionary War, the formation of the Constitution, the National Bank, Sedition Act, Jay Treaty, Louisiana Purchase, Federalism, immigration, expanding suffrage, annexation of Texas and war with Mexico, slavery, secession, and Reconstruction."
3,Hoping for a better flavor,"Texture is good, but this soup has a strange smell to it. When I was cooking it, my Mom asked what it was and made a strange face. I have to agree with her, its taste was not much better, just ok. Kinda left me with a sicky-stomach feeling. And for the overpriced cost, I just gave it three stars. Really looking for something else. If you're picky about your potato soups, then you will be disappointed in this one. Just hard to get past the icky smell."
5,Wonderful soup with no fuss!,"Bear Creek makes the best instant soup! Add packet to boiling water, stir and the end result is a tasty hot, almost homemade soup.The Creamy Potato is our favorite, sometimes I add carrots, ham, or a dallop of sour cream and sprinkle crumbled bacon to make it a gourmet treat. So easy, so tasty!"
3,Good beginners mask,"I have used this mask twice already since I've gotten it. Great look and provided great head coverage. First time I used the mask there was no fogging issues, but I found it mildly hard to breathe in it. Second use after cleaning mask once the lense started to fog. Overall the mask very good.Pros- great look, easy to clean, price and head coverageCons- fogs after one use, hard to breathe after continous play and slighty limited field of viewRecommend- fogtech defogging wipes, microfiber cleaning clothsPaintball Mask Lens Anti Fogtech Solution"
3,It's nice for the price,"For $20 it is totaly worth it, but the fact that it doesn't have foam makes it uncomfertable and it will not stop fogging. It is actouly pretty soft and looks better thanb all the other masks out there. If u are a player that plays paintball 2 times+ a month get a higher class mask like the Empire E-vent or the JT USA proflex."
2,Controller is a good idea but broke,THis controller is a cool idea with the option of Wired or wireless use. It worked fine for a few weeks but a few days ago the rechargeable batteries went bad. Would only work wired. I'm not going to hassle sending it back to the manufacturer. I stuck some rechargeable batteries in it and it works ok now. Thats probably why they include another battery cover that works with other batteries. They know their Ni-Cads are junk. Cheap product. But it works.
4,Not bad.,"This is a pretty good tree book.Not my favorite, but not bad.The illustrations aren't real exciting but they are more than good enough for identification purposes.All in all a pretty good book for someone who wants to learn about the trees of the Eastern US."
4,eye opener,If you have not read about the years 1929-1939 this book get you ready for the current crisis we face in our finacial system .I'm not a college grad and believe I grasped the subject manner
5,Better Than Expected,"If you like wild rice soup, give this a try. You'd never even know that it's a dry mix - it's that good! It's great ""as is""...but even better if you add a little chicken or turkey to it. I had some canned white meat chicken and simply used that - you really can't get any easier. I've only had a couple of the Bear Creek soup mixes at this point, but the Wild Rice is my favorite so far."
4,Awesome Party Game!!!,"I got this game the other day and played it with my family. We had tears rolling down our faces from laughing so hard. It is difficult to sing and ""dance"" at the same time, but boy is it fun to watch your friends and relatives try...especially when you create a music video of the performance and replay it!I don't know how fun it would be by yourself, but if you are looking for a great game to play with a group, this is it!"
2,"Boring, Songs Sound Terrible!","We were so looking forward to this game, totally disappointed. Not worth the money. The songs sound terrible, NOT by the original singers, not even by good singers, tempos are off...YUCK! How are you suppose to boogie to that?? Bad graphics, very few characters to choose from, the dancing is annoying. Just a bunch of random moves while you move the controller back and forth. Dull. My children, ages 9 and 10, do like this game, but really dislike the songs, and they unlocked everything really fast. I have no idea how anyone is giving this game more than 2 or 3 stars. At $60, it's totally overpriced for what you're getting. Plus the loading is really slow."
2,OK for the Kids,"If you loved Karaoke Revolution you'll probably be fairly disappointed with Boogie. Load times are longish, story mode is more annoying than fun, and the difficulty level of the game is too easy--this being a problem for adult players because you can totally suck or totally rock at singing and will likely get the same score everytime. The characters aren't all that customizable either, and the ""dance"" part of it is basically just waving your hand back and forth to rhythm (basically a cheap rip-off from Rayman's). For younger kids though, this might be an ideal game, because they won't find it too challenging and can unlock most stuff without the aid of an adult.So, in the end, if it's for your kids, find a copy less than $50 and have at it, if its for older teens and up, pass!"
2,Don't Bother With Boogie,"As someone who loves karaoke, I was really looking forward to the release of Boogie on the Wii. However, I was very disappointed with it.In Boogie you're doing one of two things, singing karaoke , or ""dancing"". The dance portion of the game is overly simplistic, and not really dancing at all. All you do is swing the controller back and forth with the beat, making your character dance. The song selection is absolutely horrible. There are a few good ones, but most of the songs seem to be geared towards girls in middle school.Don't bother with this one. It's not even close to worth the $60 you'll pay for it."
3,Not the best and not worth the money.,It's O.K. but can get boring pretty quick if u know what I mean. It's reallymade for multi player and the karaoke is a gyp. U don't even need to speak the words as long as u manage to make an audible mumble thats loud enough for the game.
2,Could be improved,There were lots of issues with this game. Half the songs didn't play or were locked. It was also not intuitive and difficult to use.
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...The Best Part is the USB Mic That's Included,"Boogie is a karaoke game that looks promising but falls flat after the upbeat Grease intro. The singing portion is fine, probably one of the better features of the game. If this is what you want then you are better off buying Karaoke Revolution. Dancing consist of you rhythmically flicking the controller and nunchuck, instead of fun it's just tiring. The ""Missions"" : Are uneventful, too much dialogue to read and younger players would have trouble. The ""video maker"" is fun at first, but the repetitiveness and lack of selection make it boring.I don't recommend this game. Maybe if you could get it cheap, it might be good at a kid's party, but that's about it."
4,Lots of Fun for the whole Family,"Whether you are playing this game or watching it being played, you are going to have fun. From my 3 yr old granddaughter to my 35 yr old son, everyone had a great time singing and dancing along."
2,Ok but a little complicated,"Hi, this game is ok. This is my first time with a singing type game. The words are changed on some of the songs which is annoying and all the actions (dancing and singing with the wii mote and the microphone) is too much for me."
2,The pitch was good.....,"The concept for the game was a great idea. Control a dancing character with the Wii remote with a great soundtrack of songs to go with it. The actual mechanics though leave so much to be desired it's not even funny. Honestly, there really should be more to your characters' moves than swinging the remote to the beat, and really, that's all there is to it. TO put it bluntly, if you loved games like Donkey Konga, DDR, Elite Beat Agents, Guitar Hero, etc. and they got you into rhythm/music oriented games then Boogie will be a major let down and make you realize how lucky we all were that this one wasn't the first of the genre or the aforementioned titles might never have gone over because Boogie ruined it for everyone."
2,Play it at your friend's house,"I bought this game after playing it one time at my friend's house. We played for about an hour and it seemed pretty fun. However I now have owned the game for less than a week and it has already becoming boring for me and the whole family. The song's get old fast and there are very few stages or characters to use. The unlockables are just different outfits and are rediculously easy to earn. The singing portion has terrible voice recognition as one can simply hum into the mic and still earn gold medals even on the hardest levels. The dancing portion is also sort of lame in that you score the most points by simply moving the controller in provided sequences such as up, down, left, right. For added fun you can hit the A button to change moves- whoo hoo! To top it off this is one of the most expensive games out because it comes with the microphone. So let your friend's shell out the $59.99 and just play it at their house; don't waste your own money on this one."
1,horribly boring,"I love to sing and dance on the Wii, so clearly, this game seemed like a good choice. However, the tutorial takes FOREVER and it took me 2 separate times just to get through it - I couldn't figure out how to skip through. The song list is good, but the songs are not by original artists, so if you already know the originals it's frustrating to sing along with the covers (tempos and melodies are off).The dancing part is definitely the worst. You can move your guy on the screen forward and back, side to side, and they do little spins and headstands. THAT'S IT! You don't actually get off your butt to dance; just press buttons on the remote and the character moves. This game is waaay overpriced, but I don't think I would even take it home for free. I haven't played it since the first day I got it."
1,Nothing good about this game,"This is the most boring game by far for the wii. The karaoke portion of the game is lame, the songs are obscure. The dancing consists of shaking the remote to the beat. That's it. Don't waste your money like I did."
4,its alright,I would have liked better songs but for the game it self its pretty fun... i am throwing a party tonight maybe that will be one that we pick to play
3,Not a bad game for Wii Karaoke.,"If you are looking for decent karaoke songs for your wii, then this game is not a bad choice. The song selections are really pretty good, as long as you don't mind remakes. The songs are not performed by the orginal artists, but are good quality nonetheless. My family really enjoys karaoke portion of the game. The Story segment is just annoying. The characters are definately directed towards younger kids (under 10) As for the dance moves It's all about timing shakes of the wii remote in certain directions. There is no actual dancing."
4,Family Fun!,My son has a great time playing this game. He likes that he can make videos and hear himself on the tv (even though he may not know all the words!) Lots of fun for the family!
1,Good if you're twelve and only if you're twelve.,"This game sounded like it could be fun, at least for the karaoke part of it. We figured we could let our nephews use it when they come over. Yeah, no. This game really stinks. It loads slowly, it forces you to go through the tutorial 100% (we're talking 10+ minutes) every time you have a new character, and they use songs that weren't really meant for 12-year-olds, which means half the words are bleeped out. Mambo #5 had about three words and then a huge part was cut where he says, ""Let's ride to the liqueur-store around the corner, The boys say they want some gin and juice, But I really don't wanna, Beerbust like I had last week,"" which means you stood their and ""picked your nose"" for a few minutes before singing again. After a few songs of play I packed it back in the box and sold it to a co-worker who has a 5, 8, and 11-year-old. For dance, buy Dance Dance Revolution and for karaoke-type stick to Rock Band or, better yet, SingStar for Playstation."
2,Not much boogie for the bucks,"I enjoy singing, and I had hoped that this game would provide lots of fun. The problem is that the game wants you to sing exactly like the original song. including all the grunts, huhs and ahs. And it doesn't care if you are actually on pitch, as long as you are following the highs and lows. So my husband, who can't match a pitch, got great scores, while I, who sing on pitch, got terrible scores because I don't do the grunts very well. So I was very disappointed. I also wish I could have know a list of songs before I purchased, because I didn't know many of the songs."
3,Kobe Soaring Dunk,"This figure of Kobe is great. It looks great from every angle. It is as if a minature Kobe is dunking. You can see him doing this move. The only negative is that his face does not look that much like him, his previous figures looked more like him. I can't wait to see this figure in the Laker road uniform or their white uniform."
2,Wrong Part Shipped.,"The item arrived in good condition and on time. However, when I did the actual installation I discovered the rear visors did not fit. My order clearly stated Mazda Protoge 5 but apparently they sent sent just Protoge parts. Returning was not an option as I had already installed one visor on drivers door. Admittedly my mistake, but be careful and thoroughly check what's been shipped before installation!"
1,Title doesn't fit subject matter,"This is where ordering a book through the internet is a little disappointing, as you can't browse the book before purchasing it. ""Camping Activities for Kids"" is very light on the ""activities."" It does a good job of laying out items that should be brought along on ones first camping trip, but falls short on suggesting outdoor activities for kids. The activities that are suggested are a little simplistic. For example, ""laying sticks apart from one another and pretending it's a river, and then have the kids jump over it and playing golf with sticks and using pine cones as balls."" I was hoping for more endepth activities. If it's your first time camping this books okay, but if you've camped for awhile and your kids are a little older the book falls short so look for something else."
4,Liked the book and was worth the money.,Mike's style is a little different but comes off well and he ends up with a fine story that both my wife and I found fun to read. The bear is the big star in this one and has to make you smile.
3,Good but bulky!,"This worked for both of my panasonic pv cameras. I use as an extra battery just in case. The only thing I don't like is the size of it. It was a bit bulky so when I would want to use the viewer (which was really rare) I would have to press my cheek against the battery. Otherwise, it's a good plan b battery!"
1,"Life Like yeah, opened XMas morn, engine died in 3 hours!!!","My wife had signed on to Amazon and left the screen up and I had set up one touch shopping. My '8' eight year old saw this train and ordered it, I was unaware until it arrived. [I only check my home email account every few days.]As for this products quality, my son played with it for 3 hours on Christmas morning and the plastic gear that runs the wheels was worn out. Maybe my son was just to young for the train set but, he loves trains and anything to do with them. Also, I found this same exact train set on other sites for as little as 59.00. I've turned off one touch shopping and I'll never use it again. Anyway, this was a great disappointment to my son, we're in the process of adopting him and his sister. This was his first Christmas with my family and it wasn't a very good one when his favorite toy wouldn't work."
3,pretty good but...,"I baught one when they were first released. The games for the time were pretty decent, and the virtual reality catch was great. Problem became nintendo abandoned the Virtual Boy. Why? It causes eye problems."
1,greatly disappointed and feeling cheated,"Bought this for my son for Christmas, as he is a collector and big-time game enthusiast. He bought it mostly just to have-as I stated above-he is a collector, but we couldn't pass up the chance to try it out. Boy were we sadly disappointed when, upon our initial trial of the product, before we even had a chance to turn on the game, the stand broke! Yes, you read that correctly, the stand broke, before we could even turn the game system on! And it didn't break from misuse or because we man-handled it-it was just either #1-poorly crafted, or #2-already beginning to break when it was shipped to us. Who knows? I DO know that it is IMPOSSIBLE to find a reasonably priced replacement stand. Once it is broken-you may as well forget it! I was more than disappointed with this purchase, and by the way, it did NOT come in the nice case as it is shown in the picture! Just came wrapped in a cardboard box!"
1,Who the hell thought this was a good idea?,"I never bought it, but it was put up on display at my local electronics store so I played it....dont remember what game....it was just bad..first was an all red screen which will give you a headache after a few minutes of playing, the system is far from portable, it was just a bad idea that shows VR gaming is still a loooooong way from being afordableget a Nintendo DS instead"
4,Got mine at a garage sale in box.,"I got mine at a garage sale a few years back and it sat in a closet for a while. This doesn't seem to cause headaches as long as you have it adjusted correctly, but the only way I found to play this comfortably is to lay completely reclined in the la-z-boy with the thing on top of my face propping the legs on my chest to keep it from pushing on my nose. I only have 2 games. Tennis and Wario Land. Wario Land is a pretty good game if you are into Super Mario style side scrolling adventure games and it is a must have game with this system."
3,Very odd gaming system that didn't last,"I played this at Sears back when it came out when I was a kid. I think I only played Wario Land, and it was a little disorienting having to have my head pressed into goggles staring at an all-red background, but it was still pretty enjoyable for what it was. Even though you would think being called ""virtual"", you would expect it to be more realistic, but it's still very different from anything in any era of gaming. It's now, obviously, a collector's item that is being overpriced online by a bunch of super nerds to probably earn money to move out of their parent's house or pay rent. To whoever is charging over $5,000....seriously?! No one is going to buy from you psycho lol."
1,Flimsy Billiard Cue,This Billiard cue did not last in our youth game room for over two weeks while previous cues have lasted for years.
1,These DO NOT fit the 2008 Saturn Vue,"Don't be duped by the convenient ""Does it fit my car"" drop down menu. Six weeks after purchasing these for my new 2008 Saturn Vue, the weather finally broke here in Ohio so after a quick trip to the car wash I came home to install these Ventvisors in the mid-day sun. It's a good thing I held them up to the windows before I scruffed up the weatherstripping because both the front and rear door vents are too short. Adding insult to injury, Amazon says it's been 30 days since my purchase and this set is ineligible for return, so it looks like I'm out $60 and I have no idea what kind of vehicle this set fits. Two days after my Amazon Prime subscription renewal, too. What are the odds?"
3,Wrong Application,"Model number was for in channel install.When recieved it was for outsde window frame.Sent back.Ventshade needs to update Application site.Have used their products before,and was satisfied."
3,auto ventshade #94524 -not as pictured,"The product is mis-leading on amazon.com. in the picture, it looks like the ventshades are mounted inside the door tracks, however when mine arrived, they could only be mounted outside of the tracks, directly onto the door frame itself. So be careful when ordering, so you get what you really want. It's too much a hassle for me to return them and re-order other ones. Otherwise, the brand quality is good and comes with a 1 yr warranty. Installation was easy- but make sure you put them exactly where you want them, because once you stick them on, they are ON for good."
3,ventshade/ventvisor,"I received the item quickly. I not sure that I am satisfied with the product yet. The instructions to install were skimpy and I was not savvy enough to figure out how to install. They are sitting in the back of my vehicle awaiting a kind friend to install or an add'l fee for installation at my next oil change at the mechanic in about 1,000 miles."
4,Fits GS500,"Got a 2001 GS500, It fits easy and was easy to install.At 6 feet tall, it took the wind off my chest, its now just a little bit above my neck hitting my head. it can be adjusted 3-4Inchs on a lower angle or higher. High means more wind slamming the shield giving you a little front end wobble. once you find the right angle for your bike it should go away. All the brackets seems to be vary strong and they look good too."
3,It's ok for the price,Instruction booklet not very clear.Windshield looks good but didn't improve my fuel economy as I'd hoped.It has a small crack in it already just from a bump against a wooden post.
3,Beware! Very light weight compared to some shields,"While the shield looks great, it is very light compared to my other ""sport"" shield. Maybe half or less in weight probably due to the fact that it's acrylic and not polycarbonate. The mounting system is not solidly lockable, at least not on my bike and speeds over 50mph do in fact cause it to creep lower over time. Upshot is you can pretty much just push it back at a stop but that will inevitably lead to further loosening.Looks are the big plus here. Have had numerous positive comments on it from others. I have it mounted to a 2009 TU250X which is one of the only UJM style bikes currently in production and it looks like it belongs on it.Additional comment: Found that the headlight bolts were not as tight as they could have been. This might have contributed to the creeping problem. Will assess and possibly revise rating given future results."
4,Funny School Poems,This little book is chalk full of high interest funny poems about school. The poems can be used as fluency intervention tools across the curriculum. I use the book to introduce a content unit or concept in almost every curriculum area. Of course it can be used to introduce poetry into curriculum areas. Too funny! There are so many funny poems I cannot choose a favorite.
3,Good background to 3ds max but lots of errors,This book provides a lot of useful info for learning 3DS MAX 4 but while reading it I felt that the book was only explaining to me how to use 3DS MAX 4 for the purpose of modeling the 6 scene short film in the book. There are also many typos in the book and I find that for people learning to use 3DS it is hard to follow the authors instructions.
4,3DS max for the beginner,"What this book lacks for the advance max user, it more than compensates for the begining user. The layout of the book is based on the completion of a single production, outlining pre-production, storyboarding, modeling, texturing, rendering and post-production along the way. Duane Loose does an excellent job of not only explaining the animation process involved with using 3DS Max but also takes the time to explain the why, the story. After all if a picture is worth a thousand words at 30fps that adds up to a lot of words really fast."
2,"Some good info, but lots of gaps in steps","This book is OK sort of. A nice flyout has all of the menus displayed. The guy spends a lot of time on theory. When he does get around to laying out the steps for actually doing something there are a lot of gaps, missing and incomplete instruction. Can be very frustrating. Obviously the guy knows how to use 3DS, but he needs somebody to proof read this thing. It is not a total waste, but it is nowhere near as good as some of the other reviews led me to believe."
5,Great!,It was great but it was a little to nerve racking. I couldn't put it down I even got in trouble for reading it to much in class.
5,Serious issues...,"The main reason why I enjoy the University series so much, is because it seems to allow the development of serious issues such as racism, date rape, sex, and so on. This particular book explores the notion of date rape and is developed particularly well with Jessica falling for handsome and athletic James Montegomery, a guy who seems too good to be true. Unfortunately, it seems that James is a guy with a few skeletons in his closet and it's up to Elizabeth to reveal the truth to Jessica before it's too late."
5,Awesome Snow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This Box set is amazing...it just makes me want to be a ski bumb for the rest of my life. I just want to travel the world as a professional skier for Warren Miller...""If you don't do it this year, you will be one year older when you do"" Quote by Warren Miller (in almost every movie)...awesome guy..."
5,love,just another classy collection from warren miller!! will watch when i am recooperating from surgrey next week! now lets go skiing
2,the item i got was not 200gr vinyl and did not seem new,"i ordered a 200gr version of this item, as it was marked:plays live/five[200gr]. i got an ordinary wieght record. also it did not seem new. i contacted the seller, thinking that this could be straightened out whith an exchange or perhaps the price was wrong.i have not heard back from this seller.the prices available are much higher. even though i feel ripped off, i am holding onto the record waiting to be contacted, waiting im afraid in vain."
2,A set of words spread over a series of pages,"I read a lot of these books because I play the game, but I'm also an avid reader of all kinds of books. I don't expect the writer to be Tolstoy, it's fantasy for godssake. I read the first book ""Sacred Flesh"" and it was a fair enough story to GM an exciting adventure, regardless of the fact that the main character is one dimensional and the rest of the characters were a mish mash of confusion. This second book on the otherhand I didn't get halfway through before I put it aside because I lost all reason to care whether the main character lived or died. The action is alright if you can keep track of what's happening. Even the sex scenes are pretty shallow. I think the writing just could have been better. I wouldn't recommend this book. Actually, I'm going to go pull my book mark out of it, I need it and I don't care to mark where I left off."
4,Great!! Must Buy,"A great CD for all who loved Loose Ends back in the day. It contains all of their U.S hits like ""Hanging On a String"", ""Slow Down"", and ""Watching You"".During the 1980's, this group was one of the funkiest and more soulful transports from the other side of the pond (along with Soul II Soul). Those of you who are interested in the story behind the group will find the liner notes very interesting. A must have for any nostalgic, 80's soul enthusiast. mt"
4,Old school,Bought this product because my wife loves Loose Ends. It had some really good tracks but my wife complained that it only had 10 songs and didn't have one of her favorites on it. I would recommend this product for any super Loose Ends fans.
5,One of my new favorites,"Highly satisfied with purchase. Loose Ends was one of my my favorites ""back in da day"". I forgot they had so many jams. However, I didn't care for their version of David Bowie's ""Golden Years"". Other than that, an excellent CD!"
3,The Loose End Review,"First of all, this cd is off the chain. When I played this cd it brought back good memories when I was young. One of my favorite songs was Slow Down.I remembered when I had my first get together at my house, the first song I played for my guests was Slow Down. Everybody got up and dance to the music. I gave this cd 3 stars because some of the music was new to me and I never heard them before.Like Nights Of Pleasure, Don't Be A Fool, and Emergency (I think that's the name of the song). But,it was wonderful to hear from this group again. The next cd I'm going to purchase is Alyson Williams cd (Raw). I hope you have that cd."
1,Sad Customer,"Even though i was promised a refund or replacement of this product(CD) i was not happy with the non-delivery. i was looking forward to listening to this long lost group which i love. So if i had to give this (CD) a review i couldn't because i have not heard these songs in so long. but i do (again love the Group Loose Ends. from this point on i will have to think twice in ordering products from this company ""orpheusentertainment""! sorry Guys you let me down!!! 1/2 star rating!"
4,Good collection,"This is a good collection of hits and fan favorites. Its not 100% comprehensive, but there are a lot of worthwhile tracks here. In all fairness, a comprehensive collection would need to be more like a double or 3-CD.BTW, to the reviewer from Jersey: I hope you're aware that Loose Ends is not from NJ, they are from the UK. And this is an import CD to begin with. In other words, Loose Ends' history began before you ever heard of them in the US. A track like ""Magic Touch"" may not be familiar to you, but it SHOULD if you are a true fan. Certainly to the fans in the UK, where Loose Ends is from, that track is an old favorite and I doubt that they could sell a ""best of"" in the UK without that track!"
2,overly slick for pesant food,she may know what she is doing but the best thing for us gringos would be to have alternate ingredients that can be used to get a t least s hint of the flavor without the efusive reverance.Southern California and The Texas coast have the best mexican fusion food much better than the original in my opinion. MXN resturants in SanDiego have achieved the ultimate in flavor and they do not pretend to be gormet but real earth and their product shows.If anyone has been to one of the sad Chipolte resturants they aspire like the auther to make the food something it just is not and Chipolte has more in common with the Bell than the real thing. No chille Moles no peper bar these are the things that make California mexican breakfast butito's so wonderful they use a proper english breakfast bacon eggs and hash browns in a burito rapper and their secret sauses wow I can taste it now but the book tries to make everything Mexican into a roman feast I just do not understand why?
1,"Estimated production cost: $3500 , or less","This movie was not only made by Rob Schneider,he also did the camera work himself,using his cellphone.10 is best, 1 is worst:-Picture quality 1-Acting: 3-Script: 2-Special effects: 1-Fun: 1-Creativity: 1If you don't believe me,go and buy it."
2,Not what you'd expect,"Not your typical Rob Schneider movie. We need comedy in life and that's why I like his movies, this was too serious for me."
5,Even More Fun Than the First!,"While THE AMERICAN GIRLS PENCIL PLAY was a fabulous book that was filled with wonderful puzzles and games, about our favorite collection of historical girls. THE AMERICAN GIRLS PENCIL PLAY 2 offers an even more exciting collection of games that will please any girl. Filled with crosswords, word searches, trivia, mazes and tons more. As I said regarding THE AMERICAN GIRLS PENCIL PLAY, THE AMERICAN GIRLS PENCIL PLAY 2 features many games; some of which minimal knowledge of the AMERICAN GIRLS life stories is required to complete puzzles - mainly trivia - but puzzle lovers will be able to complete the majority of games, even if they haven't yet embarked on the stories found in the AMERICAN GIRLS collection.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"
4,Polvo fans take note...,"Although the recording quality is not up to the standards of previous Polvo recordings, this record is still essential listening for any fan of Polvo. It's got real rockin' off-time guitar tracks like ""Face on Backwards"" to mellow (yet still experimental in the Polvo way) songs like ""No Separation."" Regardless of the quality of the recordings, it is worth the price of admission alone just to hear what Ash has been up to over the past few years. Now if he'd only play live again ....*sigh*"
4,GREAT Webcam,"I bought this Philips webcam about two weeks ago. In the past I bought a cheap $20 Logitec webcam, and MAN did it suck. This webcam has been great so far, the software is EASY to understand and to install. I bought it at Wal-Mart for $20, best money I spent. So, if your looking for a great webcam look no further then Philips."
3,Good value..but,"The software didn't install properly, so i had to use a general driver. The color is off alot, though it could be the driver. Good if you want a cheap webcam for basic uses."
2,Cheap Construction,The cheap plastic pulley that is splined to the drive mandrel strips out. I recommend this tool for VERY light use only.
1,Inadequate power,"Delta SM500 4"" x 6"" Belt/Disc SanderI used to own one of these sanders, but sold it. Its major drawback was a serious lack of power. The motor would stop almost instantly if a decent sized piece was pressed even moderately hard on the sanding belt. Very frustrating as it rendered aggressive sanding all but impossible. Perhaps if it had at least 1/2 HP it would be acceptable, but the motor Delta puts on this sander doesn't do it. If you're only going to use the tool for very small pieces of wood, it might work OK, but otherwise, buy something else."
1,Not a good idea.,"I got this sander from a major retailer and paid the same price as listed here. Good thing I got the extra warranty.I do a lot of small wood working and only have to use light preasure, so this size was actually about right for my use.The sander lasted just about one hour of use before there were problems. The drive pully behind the sanding disk was slipping out off of the shaft teeth that hold it. I found myself constantly pulling this thing apart to push the pully back in place. After about 3 hours of use the drive pully teeth were stripped out being plastic. Just the belt tension would cause the drive shaft to spin inside the pully.This is a poorly designed sander and I do not recommend it.I took it back and got the larger model 31-695. We will see how this one goes."
1,Loud,Plugged it in after buying it and this thing is pretty cheap in that its not as solid as other tools I have purchased. I will be taking it back to the store for a refund and shopping for a belt/disc sander after some research.
1,Junk,"I bought this sander because of the low price and the name brand. I have used the sander MAYBE a dozen times over the past year or so. Started having problems with the belt ""slipping"". Bought a new belt and then realised the belt wasnt the problem. Took the unit apart and found the plastic drive gear that powers both the disc sander and the belt was stripped. Poor design. I would not advise anyone to buy this sander. You get what you pay for I guess."
3,END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT,"Manhwa in general has such a unique style. While some retain more manga-esque elements, Armageddon is not one of them. In fact, Armageddon is rather unique amongst the many types of manhwa I've read so far.The story is classic sci-fi as the world as we know it has been destroyed only to be rebuilt several billion years later. The main action is set in Seoul and revolves around a small confused and immature boy named He-Sung. Having strange odd dreams about far away galaxies, they seem to be coming true when a new transfer student looks exactly like the woman in his dreams.Things get weirder when the transfer student shoots laser beams out of her eyes to stop an assassin. The manhwa then ends with He-Sung lying on the floor. What will happen next? Guess we'll have to wait until Armageddon 2WIth comedy, sci-fi, romance and action, Armageddon is definitely an epic in the making."
3,Smells genuine ...,I've always loved this fragrance and was disappointed when it was discontinued. Very happy to see it available again. I took off a couple of stars because while it came in what appears to be a genuine box it did show up without a top. Makes me wonder why it was missing ... still it does smell as i remembered.
4,Mint Julep Taffy Square Candy,"Thanks to reminiscing with my daughter (30) about my childhood experiences and the ""love"" for this particular candy she did a search on the Internet and found them. This quick search on her part enabled me to buy them. While the taste is the same, it seems they are a softer form of taffy than in the 1950's. Thanks for making a 61 year old woman to ""turn back time"" at least momentarily."
5,A Library Assistant's View,"I'm from the Caribbean island of Trinidad and I work in the Information Industry. One of my duties involve previewing new books for shelf worthiness in the library. That means picking books that patrons will find easy to use and comprehensive. This book by Congemi (out of all the books of names and meanings that we have) tops the list. It was so popular that we had to keep it as a reference item. I say 'was' because, as happens to many of the better items in a library, it has gone missing. The last user gave bogus contact information. If you want to know how good a book is look at its usage in the library and find out how many times it had to be replaced. Right now we are anxiously awaiting our replacement copy. The best feature was the name index, with the choice of fonts and the friendly 'easy on the eyes' presentation of the material running a close second and third.NVB-Trinidad."
2,Not a reliable source of information...,"This book is interesting if you are just looking for name that sound different, but don't believe in what the author wrote.As a French person, I had to have a look at the french section. I was really surprise to find names that were either not french at all or don't exist at all (like ""beau"", which is the french term for pretty or nice, but is not a name... please don't call your child ""beau"", it would make any French or french speaking person laugh!)I have no way to know whether the rest of the book was writen the same way, but how could I trust it now?"
4,good source book,"This is a good source book for socks and I'm looking forward to trying to convert some of the needle knitting patterns to a loom pattern and see what I can come up with. Then I might try some of them on needles. They look gorgeous, and very interesting. I have read through the descriptions and everything on each sock listed several times. It's a good source book for socks."
4,Great Resource!,"This book showcases the history and evolution of knitting socks as well as patterns inspired by actual historical socks and patterns. Very informative book and easy to read. I got a little bored with all of the history presented, but all in all, it is a great book even for someone who doesn't knit, but is a history buff."
5,For the sock knitter,Love Folk Socks. The classic sock pattern is perfect. The regional patterns add interesting variety. I use this as my sock reference.
3,Good History of Sock Knitting,"This book was recommended to me by a knitting instructor. If you are into the history of socks knitting, this is your book. I was a little disappointed - wanted more patterns"
3,the letter e and me,"Not as melodic or catchy as their first E.P., The letter e go for a more introspective approach in creating instrumental soundscapes that can be difficult at first but quite rewarding in the end on this new ""long player"" album. The guys in this band have all come from well practiced backgrounds, spending time in Chicago based bands like June of 44 and blue man group. So it is no surprise that when first hearing this it's going to be very complex in musical structure. The songs are rhythmically diverse, shifing tempos and odd time changes, not math rock at all, but more like tortoise experimenting with mood dynamics. The letter e play beautiful music, its just that you kind of have to stick it out for awhile to hear that fine layer. This album should be listened to multiple times, it will grow on you after awhile. Don't dismiss this band just because they are a bit challenging, to the right ear this may be the best thing yet!"
2,Superficial attacks to Catholic Faith,"When I started reading the book, I thought I was going to find a profound story with strong characters..... But, after the first chapter, I was just reading superficial attacks to the catholic church, always extreme and without real context. Every comment about the catholic church had no strong support by the characters, which I also expected to be stronger, so at the end of the book -as I always expect- the reader could at least identify with some of their feelings and thoughts. At the end, the so expected revelations, the reason d'etre of the story, are just -again- superficial ""facts""... I actually laughed at the end, because eventhough I expected much more or this book, it wasn't bad, until reading the end. I have the feeling that the author just wanted to bring all ""virtues"" of Judaism and attack Catholisism."
5,Delicious!!!!,"This is by far my family's favorite soup. I add cut up chicken breast, a can of organic diced tomatoes and a cup of frozen corn to the pot. Very flavorful, great texture! Tastes great with a dollop of sour cream and tortilla chips. Thanks, Amazon, for carrying this item as I can't find it in the grocery store anymore!"
1,Should be - 5 Stars,"Based on reviews, I bought this ""stuff"", even my dogs won't eat it.Some one got me again, probably won't be the last time that I buy ""STUFF"". You know what I mean...right?But...the next time I see 5 reviews, 5 stars and no other reviews, I'll run like the wind.Should be labeled ""STUFF"""
1,"WARNING! Seal has turned to ""holy"" awfulness!","I own every single, album, remix...you name it. So... I am not some Seal hater that needs to bring his star rating down for kicks. Having said that... this song is absolutely terrible. Right out of the gate this song hits you over the head and tells you that you need to ""stand up and give account of your faith"" followed about lines that tell you to pray to god... and search for the guiding light. Uninspired gospel droning is not something one expects from Seal. And if it were good gospel at that, I'd forgive him, but the song's lyrics read like a third grader's sunday school poem, and the instrumentation is downright annoying with lots of dated sounding motown horns. The REMIXES salvage the song quite a bit though by not using all of Seal's vocals and getting rid of the horns. So, if you like club mixes, it ok... otherwise pass on this one!"
1,Really terrible.,It has been over two months and I still don't have my book...Don't waste your time ordering from this person...
3,Worth the 5 bucks!,"I am glad I took a chance on this game. I knew I was not going to spend more than $10 for this game. My 5 yr old son always wants to play NBA 2K7 on my PS2, but I know it's just to hard for him. I reviewed Backyard Basketball & Kidz Sport Basketball. They were just too basic & I wanted him to learn about basketball. Of course this game is nowhere near the 2K basketball games in my opinion, but it is a lot of fun! I play with the advanced mode & he plays in the Family Play Mode. He can play with me or against me. It is fun playing on the same team with the game set on ""Starter"" or ""All-Star"" mode. The computer will make it very challenging, because the high rated players will hit most of their open shots. I would recommend this game for parents of young kids who are just learning basketball."
1,"Unplayable , Uninteresting & Useless!","This is a totally wasted effort. It's very basic, virtually impossible to play, and completely boring! .. nothing but a promo piece for the NBA. May as well watch the real thing on the tube and skip this junk game, unless of course you don't have cable .. then you can just sit and watch the game play itself over & over again, which is about all it's good for. If I could give it a zero I would. Only good thing is I rented it first for 6 bucks rather than buying it for 50!"
2,NOT for sport game fans,"If you have never played a basketball simulation/video game such as NBA live or the NBA 2k series this game may not be overly disappointing. If you have, however, I would recommend not purchasing this game. The play experience (independent of having few of the more entertaining features such as franchise mode, or create-your-own player) is not particularly rich in part because there are simply less options, and in part because inconsistent controller responsiveness make issues such as whether you can trigger a layup attempt much more relevant to your results than whether you can create a good shot opportunity in the first place.For those with young kids, the game is not terrible (the dunk contest and 3-point contest might be fun group games) but for those looking for a basketball experience similar to that on other platforms, stay away."
4,Great game for Wii!,This game is great! I like it because you do some of the movements basketball players normally do when they play a game!
4,"Great mix of rock, blues and more...","...had the opportunity to see these guys live at a bar on lower Broadway inNashville in the fall of 2001...they were great, to say the least. They actuallygave away a comp CD with 4 cuts. Had to buy the CD later, but holding onto the gimme' cause I'll be able to say that I saw these guys before they hitbig time..."
5,An FAQ on drawing,"No book can teach you to draw, practice is the only teacher, but what to practice?This book may not go over every topic in great depth, but it is the only book that has a page or two for the most important topics that you must practice in order to be able to see good results from the pencil."
2,Title Does Not Live up to Its Promise,"Too much time and space is spent on discussing materials. The author's drawing style is excellent. I would like to draw like that too, but this book would never get me there. Perhaps the very utmost beginner who needs to know the difference between a #2 pencil and #3 the book could be inspirational. It does not reach far enough for the advancing student of art."
1,Too Expensive!,"This yarn can be bought in any color at any craft store for a fraction of what it is being sold on here for. Print out a 40% off a reg priced item coupon for your local store, go in, and get the same thing for $1.50 or less!"
3,A dry commentary on other people's work,"It is unfortunate that the only books in English that come up when one searches for an overview of the Toltec civilization are two by Davies. Most of the material in this volume is scholarly commentary on other people's work, written in a dry, wordy style. The only conclusions that would be of interest to the general reader are that the term Toltec was used by a variety of groups in Mexico, and that the Toltec empire was less significant than its traditional ranking with the Aztecs and others would imply."
5,Best Ever Well Researched Book on the Toltecs of Mexico!,"This is simply the best ever book on the Toltecs ever! Nigel Davies sorts out what is fact and what is fiction about a peoples about which much pure legend abounds! He sets up an accurate chronology of events in Toltec history, and acertains the extent of the Toltec empire at its zenith. Nigel Davies actually studied at the School of National Anthropology in Mexico City, although he recieved his doctorate from Eaton in London. He has gone on to live in Mexico City since 1962 and has continued his studies about these ancient peoples of Mexico. He wrote several books about these peoples both in English and Spanish of which this is the best. Due to his education in England there is no problem of bad translation; this is the original language it was written in. The 1st Edition I own has a wonderful glossy photo section over 30 pages long!"
5,OMG!,"Well, what can I say? As other people mentioned, this bag is awesome! All the good points and aspects of the bag have been said. Very nice bag, and it's huge. My first impresion was the size, and my 15'' mac fits perfectly, allowing more space to put other stuff. The material looks very resistant, and the latches are strong enough for you to run around with it.Very very very very recommended!!!!"
2,Billy don't be a zero,"I agree with the firest write up. I had not pulled this CD out in a while and think I bought it used at a pawn shop in Chciago, but the sound was the absolute pits. Billy Joe Royal has some classic sixties offerings but they are presented here in re-recorded versions here. NOT THE ORIGINALS. Nor are all the hits like ""I Knew You When"" included, making it incomplete, lousy sound and remakes. Royal deserves better than that and so do you.RECOMMENDATIONS:Very Best of Billy Joe Royal: The Columbia Years (1965-1971)[2 CDs].Best of Billy Joe Royal [SONY](Nice set of hits but only 10 cuts long].Down in the Boondocks/Cherry Hill Park (his first 2 LPs on one CD)"
1,predictable,"This book is a boring, pedestrian, cliche. Much of the dialogue sounds like it was taken from the noir parody ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid""."
1,Don't support censorship,"This Del Rey edition of ""Tom Paine Maru"" was deliberately butcherer by cutting all philosophical and political content at the hands of Del Rey's editors.Don't support such censorship. I read the Del Rey edition and later found an uncensored version on the web. L. Neil is right they butchered what he wrote"
5,Times were tough...,"Corporal Whitey O'Thraight came from a harsh planet, a planet that sent him, and the rest of the crew, to look for a better planet. But the Asperance's first voyage is its last when just a few hours after landing most of his people are killed by the savages (who are living in their version of the Middle Ages). It seems he has the choice between being burned at the stake or just tortured.But then he is freed by the crew of the Tom Paine Maru. And then things get dangerous.A great book, kind of a sequel to The Venus Belt. It can stand alone, all you have to do is read enough of it to get the basic background. Set in The Probability Broach universe, so lots of surprises and a interesting setting."
4,Afternoon in the Amazon,"Afternoon in the Amazon was written by Mary Pope Osborne. This fiction book contains 63 pages and is the sixth book in the Magic Tree House series. The illustrator is Sal Murdocca.In this book there is a boy and a girl named Jack and Annie. They find a magic tree house. In the magic tree house, there are tons of books. They open one book that is called Afternoon in the Amazon. They wish they are in the book, and then they are at the Amazon. They go though some dangerous events throughout the story.This author wrote fluidly and made this story easy to follow. I think this story would be interesting for young readers who like adventures."
5,It was an exciting adventure story.,I liked when they went into the tree house and spun around and all of a sudden were in the rain forest. My favorite character was the monkey. I didn't like how the author always described how the characters talked. I would recommend this book. It was fun to read. Logan (age 8)
4,Review of Afternoon on the Amazon,"I am a 10 year old boy at my summer school. This is a book about Jack and Annie. They are two kids. They are trying to free Morgan. They are looking for a mango in the Amazon. My favorite part is when the jaguar chased them. It was awesome.It is a nice story. It has cool animals, trees, and bugs. But I wish it was longer. I recommend it because it was amusing and awesome."
2,I LOVE GOO-GOO BALLS,"This is a low budget ""comedy"" about local news stations and wanna-bees trying to scoop each other on the story of some strange killings that seem to be connected to the cows. Judging from the actors and dialouge, I supposed this was to be a comedy, although I never laughed at their amateur attempt at humor, including the two ranch hands who copied ""Bill and Ted."" The lone ""special effect"" is someone shaking the camera while shooting.The comedy aspect of the killer cow was never exploited to its fullest. The movie does have some cute blonds but not enough to carry the film. They use a terrible font where ""M"", ""N"" and ""H"" all look the same on the screen. The movie is far from ""hilarious"" as falsely described on the box. If you see writer/director/actor Chris Palko, tell him he owes me $2.00.No sex, no nudity, no bad language, no acting, no blood, no gore."
1,Shannon betrayed,"I agree with those readers who say that the book is very long for what it contains. It is also full with personal life details which are not so important to be reported to the reader. But what has hit me most is the author's claim that the information theory was already there at the end of the XIX century, forgetting Shannon and his paper. Shannon deserves much more than only mentioning him (together with Nyquist and Wiener, clearly minor actors in information theory) in a line! This a very bad book when the author deals with history, written by an amateur, not a professional. In my edition cover it is written: ""I urge you to buy this book"" citing John Gribbin (from whom I took the advice): well you can buy it but do not waste your time in reading it (just scan it)."
3,"Not so innovative, but worthwhile","not so innovative as I'd thought, but still valuable.more divulgative than technical.see also ""A Shortcut Through Time : The Path to the Quantum Computer"", by George Johnson (2003), and ""The singularity is near"", by Ray Kurzweil (2005)"
1,Bad Science,"Lloyd's grandiose hypothesis/opinion/wishfull thinking is that ""The universe is a quantum computer"" For a hypothesis/opinion to become an accepted scientific theory/fact, it must be self-consistent, and it must make a good number of sharp predictions that separate it from competing theories, and, of course, all its predictions must agree with experimental observations. lloyd does not bother to show that his hypothesis/opinion meets any of the conditions that would make it a scientific theory. For this reason, in my opinion, LLoyd's book is an opinion book dishonestly presented as a science book."
2,It says quantum so it must be clever,"The author says that the universe is a computer because it manipulates matter in an automatic, unthinking way - just like a computer.But surely this is a circular argument? As the computer works by using the laws of physics, it is a truism to say that the laws of physics themselves constitute a computation. What does this statement actually tell us?I was hoping that the book would put some flesh on the author's idea, but after reading it I'm still waiting.At any point in the history of humanity, we have used our most sophisticated knowledge for explanatory purposes. When the most sophisticated machine was a clock, we described the universe as a clockwork machine. Now that the cleverest thing we know is quantum theory, we get books like this."
4,Programming the Universe: A Quantum Computer Scientist Takes On the Cosmos,This book is suitable for understanding the author's idea that the universe is a vast computer system. I think author's idea is very interesting from the standpoint of cosmology.
3,"Review of Michener ""Space"".","It started out ok from a historical viewpoint, but then it degenerated into a bunch of silly stuff that had nothing to do with history."
5,Just a beginer,"In responce to sean of from Little Silver, New Jersey. I am only through the first chapter and i allready feel like i've read an entire book. Its not bland like most i have read. I to aspire to go into the field of space exploration, and this novel only lets my imagination expand more. Like Professor Anderson said ""The stars reach out and grab you. They infect your mind...you'll always be a prisoner."" That's what this book has done, i cant put it down. It definitly deserves five stars."
3,Takes forever to build up,"Let me tell you. I listened to the abridged version on audio cassette and it was long and boring as anything I've read. But as another reviewer pointed out the scene on the Moon is captivating. It's worth wading through this book for this ending. But if you looking for SF, look elsewhere. Oh yeah, where in the heck is Freemont?"
2,Unfocused,"I found myself unable to get through this book without skimming only the first sentence in each paragraph. While it is perhaps a necessity of the subject matter, all of the main characters (Especially Mr. and Mrs. John Pope) appeared to be without fault, and their lack of emotional growth throughout their lifetimes made them boring. Furthermore, the author has a tendancy to describe trivial details of the lives of minor characters, with no hope that they will become significant to the plot later. However, I found myself enchanted by the fictional Apollo 18 mission to the ""Other Side"" of the moon, and some of the technical aspects of the work. The classic film ""The Right Stuff"" based on the Tom Wolfe book of the same name covers the space race in a much more engaging and dramatic fashion."
3,Inaccurate and self-serving,"In the 1960s my husband worked for NASA in Houston. He helped develop the photography program used by the Gemini and Apollo astronauts -- he trained them, evaluated their photography and cataloged the results. We were there. We KNOW what the program was. We saw it and knew the people involved.Michener's SPACE almost turned me off on historical fiction for good. His inaccuracies are so overwhelming that they are disgusting and so many that it would take volumes to refute them. Perhaps the author relied too much on mediocre research assistants. He was, after all, getting old when he wrote the book.Sunnye Tiedemann (aka Ruth F. Tiedemann)"
3,"Well Written, yet poorly edited","Michener rambled on way too long for my liking about insignificant things such as small characters with no meaning to the plot. The Kolfs were extremely well written, yet I found that the Pope's and the Mott's were the ideal American perfect family people, especially the Pope's. Senator and Mrs. Grant, on the other hand were perfectly written. The book definetly has ups and downs, and turns into more of a slow read, than the fast pacing that was Michener's style."
5,A loosely accurate and dramatic view of the space age...,"Space is an excellent work of historical/science fiction. It is precisely this odd blend of genres which make it a wonderful book. James Michener, as always, had studied this topic extensively before writing the novel, and its accurate representation of facts and situations is notable. The novel deals with the space age, its history, purpose, and future, and climaxes with a fictional account of Apollo 18. The actual Apollo moon missions ended with Apollo 17, but Michener delivers a dramatic plot, interesting characters, and wonderful description to make the story addictive. This is definitely a book which should be read by anyone who wishes to learn the details of America's space program, and also by anyone who is looking for hardcore science fiction"
2,A Real Disappointment,"As much as I was looking forward to reading another Michner book, I am having a lot of trouble finishing this one. It has been a real disappointment.It starts out fine, but around the halfway mark really starts to drag. There is way too much time spent dwelling on the details of the character's personal lives, even the politicians, and all of that info almost seems like it was thrown in to act as filler.Areas that could have used more material and info are just briefly touched upon or passed over completely.The USA has been headed for the dark side of the moon for about the last 100 pages, but I don't think my interst is going to last long enough to see them get there."
3,SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I enjoyed reading this book, but I couldn't help feeling that JM missed an opportunity to bring some really great characters more fully to life. JM tends to stick in a lot of information that might be better suited if it was more integrally worked into the plot.The characters were very memorable, but they didn't seem to do a whole lot throughout the book. JM has written better books and I will keep reading his vast catalog."
3,Good overview once you get past the fluff,"I am not much for fluff, and the glossy, heavy paper, along with the pretty full-color photos are just money and space wasted where more songs could have been. However this is a good selection of ALW's work, and is especially valuable to the soloist."
5,Very easy to consume,"East to consume Creatine. They taste pretty good (kinda like chewable vitamin C but a bit on the hard side) Not too chalkly like other chewable Creatine tabs (they also contain 60mg of vitamin C (100% rda)). One tablet before or after workout is the recommended dosage (after the ""loading"" phase). Will buy again."
2,"AGAIN, BE WARNED THIS IS NOT FINAL EPS FROM 56 BUT FROM 53!!!","ITS ABSOLUTE SHAME THIS SHOW N LAUREL N HARDY SKETCH WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE 39 HM SPECIAL HOSTED BY MEADOWS IN MID 1980s. I CANT BELIEVE SUCH IMPORTANT GEMS HAVE NEVER BEEN ON VIDEO, ITS BEYOND SHAMEFUL!!!"
2,Not as described,Does not come with the handle as stated in the product page. And though there are 6 cutting tools in the photo there are only 5 that come in the box.
3,"If you need to record movie at night or in house , forget it","I bought this camera 2 months ago. It is light, nice, very small camera. I inserted 1 GB Sd memory and waited 1 hour movie. Failed, 40 minutes later low battery ,and then 10 minutes later Sd card low messages appeared. I recorded 50 minutes movie maximum.Second test was in house but result is big grens-points. It can't record DVD quality. If you connect this camera to 42"" TV, you can see distorsion and bad picture. Photo mode quality maybe nice than other 5mp china cameras, but this concept model need more engineering."
5,Kumak's House,"My three year old was engrossed as I read this book to her. I couldn't turn the pages too fast because she was busy examining all the details in the illustrations. At the same time, my 11 year old 7th grader who was born reading wanted to see the illustrations also. He did not leave his chair til I had finished the book. My three year old immediately wanted me to read the book to her again. It is a pleasure to be able to read them a story depicting Native children and adults engaged in cultural activities.From a bush teacher's point of view- a great piece of literature with local ties.I hope this is only the first in a long line of books from this talented author and illustrator!"
1,Not as Good as it Seems,It looks cute. But it's not. It's just a freaky over dressed 6 inch doll. I would be embarrased to give or recieve this doll.
2,Highlands - Whiteheart,Somewhat disappointed in the overall album. Found only 2 songs that were good. It just doesn't flow like some of their other music i.e. Powerhouse
2,SCARY THEME & POTENTIAL **** RUINED BY LAME SCRIPT & ACTING,"REALLY POOR ACTING AND A REALLY LAME SCRIPT RUIN A POTENTIALLY INTERESTING MOVIE, GREAT LOCATION AND THEME, SPECIAL EFFECTS ARE EVEN GOOD BUT NOTHING WILL SAVE THIS MOVIE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RACK. THE SCARIEST THING IS HOW MUCH YOU JUST SPENT FOR THIS MOVIE!!!"
3,"Resting shephard - glazed accents, chinese ceramic","The one I received is of a different color than pictured here. I'm OK with what I got, but if you consider purchasing this, I suggest you contact the seller first."
3,Not worth the money,"I finally broke down and tried this concealer, since everyone raves about it. It works well, but not noticeably better than the $12 ones from the drug store. If it were fabulous, I'd pay the money, but it's nothing special so not worth the huge price tag. All hype."
2,Not worth the price,"I purchased this and quite frankly am wondering why they felt it should be that expensive. I have some M.A.C. concealer that works a lot better and is 1/3 the price. Save you're money on this one, even Maybelline is better than this."
4,"Fun to use in the classroom, for home-schoolers, and with your own kids!","I use Latin Everywhere, Everyday to teach my 8th grade class a new Latin phrase everyday. At the beginning of the week I give them five phrases, one for each day of the week, and at the start of each class we discuss one phrase as an attention getter. At the end of the week I have the students do practice questions from this book about the phrases, and then I make up my own written quiz. This book can be used at any grade level and in many different ways. The book includes chapters on and activities with general Latin sayings, Latin state mottoes, and Latin abbreviations that we still use today. The only thing that could be added to this book would be quizzes for teachers to use."
5,Great resource for an intro to Latin,"I purchased this book to use with my two children, ages 11 and 13. We are not doing a formal study of Latin, but i wanted them to become familiar with common phrases found in writing and on buildings. This book far exceeded my expectations. The best part is that my kids are really retaining what they have learned and are so excited when they can either use a phrase themselves or can understand one they read somewhere. The book does a fine job of teaching the most important Latin information that an educationally literate person should acquire."
5,Fry pan recipes,This is one of my favorite fry pans and having lots of recipes to choose from makes it even better. Happy to have cookbook and service was great.
3,Critics agree - Cox should stick to mixing...,"This is mostly Cox's own work from start to finish. How does it pan out? Well he is one of the very few DJs to do this, but he is no Van Dyk and this album is certainly hit or miss. I think it is good to see Cox try something like this and it does show that he has a lot of musical talent but he is SOOOOOOO much better when is just hitting the decks and this is really what people want to hear. So approach with caution, even hardcore Cox fans may not like it."
3,the bigger they are the harder they fall,the CD contains some realy great songs punctuated by dissapointing exploits of carl's humor such as black shoulin and other sounds that i cant remember the names of. To be honest the songs are good but just dont belong side by side and make it difficult to listen to the whole CD without getting a bit frustrated. If carl was going for a addam sandler type sound on this CD the I would like to be the first to congradulate him on successfuly doing just that. Its hard to believe that one of the most respected DJ's today would put this album together but hey the mans gotta make a living.
4,Diversity at its best,"I can see why other reviewers said this cd was difficult to listen to due to the differences in sound between tracks. But, I think it just illustrates Carl Cox's brilliance as a dj. Even though the tracks have very different sounds, they still flow together seamlessly. You will not get bored listening to this cd. If you like hearing salsa with a techno pop, followed by reggae/hip-hop, followed by some slammin trance... then this cd is for you. ENJOY!"
2,This man's compositions bore me,"""World's best DJ"" indeed. This man should stick to just spinning. As a composer he falls flat--all songs have the standard BOONCH BOONCH 4/4 repetitive-to-yr-skull beats, stupid vocal samples and Kraftwerk rip-offs. Nothing I haven't heard before done MUCH better. Do yrself a favor, listen to Adam X or Jeff Mills. This man BORES me. Very disappointing."
3,no as good as we expect it!,"carl cox as a dj one of the best global underground maestro , as a producer not too good not too bad either. this album has some good tracks like future 2000 and the 2 track and also track 6 and 7 are jungle they sound good , but some other tracks just sounds like cheap expiremental jams . anyway i like some of the tracks but i recommend to sample the whole cd before you buy it."
4,"Makes hair soft, managable & has a pleasant scent","I bought this because, it was raved about by a youtube subscriber. I wasn't dissapointed with the results. I like that it has a pump so, the bottle doesn't slip from your hands. Also, it has a fruity smell that isn't overwhelming and quite pleasant. I was very impressed with how my hair was super soft and was easy to maneuver through tangles. I definetly will purchase this again!"
5,Ibiza round brush,Excellent product! Received quickly. Packaged and made well. I would recommend for anyone who blows dry their hair daily as it doesn't pull or knot hair.
5,Love the smell,"Got it first as a sample for my husband in the set of 10 samples, and we both loved this smell. Got it delivered very quickly."
4,highly recomendable for vampire film fans,"I have been waiting for this movie to come out for a couple of years. I have seen it and all the others and I must say that this really is the best Subspecies film out there. Nicolaou really has created his own little vampire universe with these movies. Radu is back once again to regain Michelle, his relunctant consort. This time she is under the care of a doctor who's not all that he seems. the lines between good and bad are not as defined in this one, making it a more brilliant piece of filmmaking. if you are familiar with the previous Subspecies films or just want to watch a great one, chose this movie."
2,Could have been better,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. However, I was taken back by how poorly it was done. If they make another one I hope they put more time into it. I think they should have entitled it bloodbath instead of bloodstorm because you feel like they are bathing in the past gorly of the previous suspecie movies."
2,the worst in this series,I was a little skptical of this movie when I saw it in the video store. I hated the cover. It wasent very original. I thought this was the only subspecies movie that had a cover that sucked. Right from start the movie was bad. It started out with these flashbackes you couldent even see and in the middle of them it said subspecies 1 2 3 and 4. the movie starts out with all the main charecters from the previous movie dead from a car wreak.They take the main charecter to a hospital where this mad scientist says he will take care of her.Through the movie there are new charecters that are very bad actors and are very boring. there is nohing strang or new in this movie.It is just a very traditional vampire film.I felt they just put this film out as fast as they could and dident work very hard on the story.I didnt like the way Radu came back.It was unexplained.Radu is like superman You cant kill him.
2,What the...,"I think they made this movie to fast, it starts off with the main characters from subspecies 3 in a car wreck. but you can plainly see it's not the same stars. they do a bunch of flashbacks, even with scenes from the first Subspecies movie. which didn't make sense. And then Radu comes back from oblivion. just like that. Why..who knows. I just hope, if they decide to make another one. they should explore Denice Duff's Character more."
3,Only works on one side of the door,"Sturdy and attractive, BUT it only fits on the outside of the door. If you want the hook to to hang on the inside of the door, the padding at the top will not allow the door to close. Most of us want our bathrobe, or whatever, to hang behind the door (when it's open) and inside the room (when it's closed). A poorly thought out design."
5,a magic-carpet ride away from emotional problems!,"I used to think emotional ups and downs were a part of life until I read this book and found that the downs could be dealt with, and the ups could be enhanced. There are lots of chapters, including 8, which has wonderfully sensitive and understanding text, plus oils and formulas, for an A-Z of ""emotional problems"" from abuse, addictions,aggression, amnesia, anxiety, apathy ..... and that's just the A's! And it's all so thorough - Under addictions there's drug alcohol and nicotine addiction, each with suggested oils and recipes to use. But, hey, this book is about positive mind frame, so is equally thorough in it's advice for alertness, assertiveness, concentration, confidence, contentment, creativity, focus, happiness, joy, memory enhancement, peace, performance, positivity, restfulness, self-awareness, self-esteen, self image. DO I SOUND POSITIVE? It's no surprise - this works!"
5,A Must have Book,"This book is Great! For the Novice or someone who has been into Essential Oils for awhile. Easy to read and put into practice all the wonderful ideas. Signed: A Fruitie! Read it , then you will understand! :)"
4,Should you Meet the Robinsons?,"Meet the Robinson lets players take control of Wilbur Robinson on his quest to return his dad's stolen time-machine. The game offers a good mix of action, adventure and puzzle-solving, while telling a slightly different story compared to the Disney movie. We enjoyed Wilbur's positive attitude towards helping and solving other characters problems -given that he needed their help in return, but still I always welcomes polite characters. The game requires a good amount of reading in order to use different menus, maps and instructions. The level of difficulty is easy to moderate and increases in the later part of the game. Overall Meet the Robinsons is good (but not great) single player Movie/Game, for kids ages 10 and up - even for those who did not see the movie. Disney's Support Website offers a Walkthrough for some of the levels."
2,Not that great,"My 7 year old son wanted to buy this game but we rented it first and I'm glad that we did. This game isn't that great and gets boring fast. Each level is long and takes a while to get through. In each level you're assinged different tasks to complete. Without my help, my son wouldn't be able to complete each level. After an hour of playing this game, my son was ready to take it back to the video store. If you're still thinking about buy this game, rent it first."
2,Can we play something else?,"My 6 year old daughter, who is younger than the recommended 10+ really wanted this game. I think the game was intended for older kids, but the movie is popular with younger kids. So what happens? She can't quite do the needed moves and hands me the controller. From then on she sits next to me telling me what she wants to do. Pretty decent family time although it reminds me a little too much of driving with a backseat driver. Very soon the game becomes old and boring. Another movie inspired game. I found myself stuck on the couch for hours playing a boring game on behalf of my daughter, who loved every minute of it."
2,don't use directions on can,"I followed the directions exactly as written on can and the birch wood i stained turned out all blotchy i think the first reviewer may have the right idea will try it his way then re-review, so i said i would revise this review once i tried using this product again still not happy with it just doesn't work like it should your better off getting some clear Dewaxed Shellac and mixing it 50/50 with denatured alcohol apply to wood lightly sand when dry then apply stain it works waaay better than tis stuff"
5,Another Chet Baker?,"Maija's rich, sultry voice ignites the songs in this CD. The variety is incredible. Old jazz favorites like Cornet Man and Devil May Care with a touch of Brazilian. This singer sings from her soul. A great addition to any CD collection."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"I picked this up because I thought if nothing else, there would be some interesting stuff to look at it.Quite a bit of the not overly dense text is associated with tips or technical comments aimed at artists, so not really of much interest in general to the rest of us.There are examples of different styles and media, and even a prototype Star Wars poster.It also talks about how he uses toys and even a stuffed iguana as models sometimes - which explains some of the weird dragons."
3,Not the best,The only good thing about this game is that it will entertain you. Other than that the graphics are the worst I've seen out of all my games and the camera angles at times are pretty bad. Looks like a rushed job to get this game out. Could of had so much more potential.
3,Expectations not met,"I expected a whole lot more from this game. I've had it a whole two days and have only played it a few hours and I have the game 95% complete. I was hoping for better quality and a more complex plot. I enjoyed doing the lessons and the mini-games like gobstones and quidditch, but that was about it. I was hoping for some interesting battles and was there was no actual action and it was way to easy to ""power up"" spells. There is also a pointer at the bottom of the screen that tells you exactly where to go all of the time which takes away the only part of the game that could have been slightly complex (the navigation of the castle). There was just little excitement and a real lack of complexity to this game."
5,I Really Enjoyed This,"This game is great.I love the graphics. Sure, this game is not the most visually stunning thing in the world, but it was not horrible.The game is fun to play; progress is notable and the game has a couple of different things to do (mini games and the like).My only complaint is that you have to complete a stage or task in order to save the game. You cannot automatically save.I have a great time playing this."
3,"Expected better, but still okay","Very simple, very short game. The many mini-games are nice, but they don't quite make up for the games deficiencies. Not very exciting, but worth it for dedicated Harry Potter fans."
1,My kids are totally frustrated with the lack of a save system!,"My kids really like this game , but it is ridiculous to make a game these days without a save system. Poor execution here. One child plays for a long time and closes the cover of the DS to hold their place in the game and the next sibling mistakenly turns the DS off resulting in lost games, tears and fights. Completely stupid system!"
2,Most boring game I own,"I was really excited when I ordered this game and anxiously awaited its arrival. After all the previews I saw of it on a dvd made it look great. But was I ever disappointed when I started playing the game. I am a huge fan of Harry Potter books and movies even though I'm adult. The game was just boring, nothing but running back and forth through the same corridors and every few minutes having to play the same duel game or attend a DA meeting. There is little if any skill involved so a very young child might like this, but its doubtful to appeal to anyone above 8 or a skilled gamer. The most fun part of the game is playing Gobstones as that was the only thing challenging. If you insist on getting this make sure you have a touch screen protector as you will destroy your touch screen casting spells."
2,Not sure,"I couldn't really get into this game, I didn't have the patience. It has harry potter in it and other characters, im sure a kid would be more happy with it than an adult."
3,Harry Potter,"I love the Harry Potter games, but this one doesn't seem to flow right. You have beat the game before you know it and you still have all of these things that you have to find. The spells you have to cast are pretty easy, but they don't really explain how to do them so there is one that is tricky. Overall, the game was ok"
2,I hate the duels!!!,"I have found this game enjoyable- up to a certain extent. I just recently purchased the nintendo ds and am still getting used to it. There are a lot of things- such as some of the mini-games that I enjoy. HOWEVER, I simply detest the duels!!! Why? you may ask-simply because I cannot seem to cast a spell worth a flip. I think I am doing it right-but then I get a ""dreadful"" or ""very poor""- and then Harry, Ron and Hermione drop to the floor- I just cannot seem to grasp the art of dueling via stylus- I think if I am able to master that- I may have a higher opinion of this game in general. By the way, If anyone out there has some pointers-feel free to pass them on to me on the discussion forum. Thanks. Charlotte R."
5,This works,"I have chronic constipation caused by medication and partial paralysis of the lower half of my body. Keeping the bowel free is important. I've used Docusol, which works as well, but Enemeez bulk packaging is convenient. The product name (enemy-ease) is a bit unfortunate."
5,HOOoChA,"Buy this one, i tell ya, if you like rather dark music with a lot of style. this album is surely one of the best ones in 2000... the production is crisp, and every track is completely different from what you've ever heard before. a lot of special collaborations round it up. track 2 ""killing culture"" is a quite dark hiphop track w/ scratchin and vocals by Maxim himself. track 3 ""carmen queasy"" is one of the best and most original tracks out in the last time, using a sample from the animals' 'house of the rising sun' an having skin from skunk anansie on vocals. ""scheming"", the last single release off the album, is also very special in style tho you got to get used to the sound of it. ""my web"", the first single, is a dark and slow track with maxim on vocals, and ""backward bullet"" with the sneaker pimps is moody as hell. at all, the atmosphere the album gives when listening to it makes it a must have!!"
3,"I like, but I just don't get it.","My favorite song is Carmen Queasy, in fact that is why I bought the CD, and I love Skin. The beats are very cool, I just don't understand what Maxim is trying to make us feel. There are a few other songs on the album I like, so I don't listen to the rest that often. Overall it's good, but I just didn't get it."
3,McCulloch hedge trimmer,"I got another trimmer for our other house, and it is so much better than this one. I had a hard time putting on the protection plate, and find it doesn't cut as fast or efficiently as the other one."
4,Touch Of Heart For A Traumatic Past,"Young Donald Oakes is terrorized by nightmares as a child growing up in Alabama. As he grows the nightmares of his childhood don't leave. Once the past starts interfering with life in the 1980's can Dr. Engel really help Donald survive the psychic defenses brought about brought about by a painful childhood?This book takes a griping look at life in the deep south when segregation was reality. Go from sharecropper shack to sharecropper shack with Donald's ghosts of the past.A book that will touch the heart of anyone who has suffered through a traumatic past. You won't regret reading this one!As reviewed by Epstein LaRue, author of ""Crazy Thoughts Of Passion"" and ""Love At First Type"" http://www.epsteinlarue.com/"
1,Are you kidding me?,"This book was absolutely terrible. The prose was sloppy & base, and the story was bland and uninteresting. The narrative basically lurches from one prepubescent sex scene to another, and the book ends with an oddly uplifting tone. Probably the most creative passages in the entire book were the metaphors for sex and reproductive organs. This book could've been written by an inventive 5th grader. I think there's a lot of local support for this author- hence the positive reviews from North Georgia residents. Trust me- Oakes is a far cry from a new incarnation of Faulkner."
4,Tasty stuff,Delightful. Wayne is a tasty guitarist... but more of a master chef in a kitchen full of talented cooks. And danceable! One of the surprise bands of the year.
3,Okay but....,Most sections seemed to be missing a few steps. If you are a total beginner this is not the book for you. If you have some talent then by all means get this book.
3,Good source for drawing flats.,"This book briefly goes into how to draw flats, but for learning every other aspect; from shading, to creating fabric folds, to drawing lace, and plaids i would recommendFashion Sketchbookinstead. Hope this helps :D"
4,nice wtach,attractive watch but a little tight around my wrist. The date is a little difficult to read. very accurate timekeeping. I have a link to add to the band but have not taken it to someone to add. A solid watch without being too flashy
2,Boring and hard to read,"This was an assigned text when I was working on my master's degree in writing. I actually care about composition pedagogies, yet I found this book to be boring and hard to read. Honestly it would be a lot easier just to read a collection of scholarly essays than a survey text that isn't able to simplify the issues so that a beginner can catch on."
4,YOU STUPID NURSE!!,"I first saw this ""classic"" during a Horror Movie festival hosted at my house in 1986. Out of all the films that were shown that night. This movie is the one that stood out. You have to check your brain in at the door and enjoy the ride. Bad acting, hilarious story, and some of the most memorable lines in a horror film. Watching the killer breating heavily through the surgical mask after he kills his prey speaks volumes!You can't take this movie seriously. It's not ""Gone With The Wind"" folks! It's a 80's classic slasher film with no budget! But a barrel of laughs!"
5,Love the slightly smokey flavor,This is my favorite tea. Especially the Gold label. It has a rich dark flavor and a very slight essence of cigar. Very slight but very sexy.
2,did not fit my car,"i bought a complete set, front and rear. the rears were too big. unfortunately i did not replace all my rotors at the same time, so it was a few months before i realized the problem. the fronts were great though, no complaints there"
1,Wrong Product Received,Ordered a set of these springs for my 96 Tercel and received a set of Mitsubishi Eclipse/Eagle Talon springs. I was very disapointed with the purchase as I brought the springs to Jamaica therefore it would cost too much to return.
2,Test and Improve?,I agree with the subtitle of the book about testing your skills.... but definately not on Improving your game. The answers and the tips at the end of each quiz are telegraphic ... nothing you would benefit from. Testing your skills? Yes maybe the results of the tables can give you an idea of your level.
5,Short & Sweet BG Puzzles,"I enjoy short and sweet formats in books. In particular, I like this kind of puzzle format.I like how the puzzles make you think -- and learn specific parts of the game of backgammon. You can put the book down and pick it up, flipping to various puzzles to refresh your memory about the important aspects of the game. This reminds me of the old Barclay Cooke book I had as a youngster (LOL: several of Cooke's solutions have been proven wrong by today's neural net backgammon software programs) -- but it was ""Good stuff"" -- just like this book."
5,Small but cute,"He is only 8"" which I knew but my children carry him around everywhere. A little lopsided in the beak and clothes area, but not enough to really matter. He is durable and any damage I would certainly have to blame on my children lol."
2,Interpretations Lacking in Depth,"In Karl Leister we have the polar opposite of Richard Stoltzman. Stoltzman's phrasing is unenduringly cloying. Leister's will cure insomnia. Leister is an expert clarinetist. (How else could he have been first desk of the Berlin Philharmonic?) However, when he plays solo and chamber repertoire, he demonstrates little zest or imagination. The late works of Brahms call for a penetrating musicianship that is lacking in these interpretations."
4,No issues with gameplay for me.,"The history is accurate. Not perfect. But this is just a game.It is a reasonable representation of history as we know it.No programming problems for me at all. No crashes. No missing menues, as one other reviewer here said. This ran perfectly on my computer and i enjoyed it even more than i had anticipated.One thing i found amazing was that there could be hundreds of fighting soldiers within your sight, and i never had a problem with lagging.The box says this can display up to 80,000 soldiers in combat in just one mapped environment. That's incredible. And, it certainly seems accurate.I think any war buff would enjoy this. Don't let the naysayers turn you away.It's worth it."
1,Black shoe not as represented in picture,"I just received this shoe in black. While it is a nice shoe, the picture indicates the black shoe has brown trim on the toe and heel. The shoe that I just received has black trim on the toe and heel with no brown at all.If the picture had correctly indicated the colors on the shoe, I would not have ordered it."
2,Too scarey for kids,"Although I am a big fan of the original Rainbow Fish book, I didn't care for this one and ended up returning it. I thought it was too scarey for my two year old....the whale is just too angry and the fish get frightened, etc., not the best themes for litle kids. Read the first Rainbow Fish book, it's the best."
1,Disappointment,"It was advertised as ""like new"" but when I opened it a page was ripped in half with words from the story missing. Would never order from this site again!!"
5,lots of lessons taught,"I love this story. ... I think it teaches lots of lessons. For example, it teaches how it is wrong to make snap judgements about others. It also teaches how to work out differences, and meet with people that are different."
2,"Same moral, different story","For the third time in as many books, Marcus Pfister passes along the lesson ""Be nice to others."" That was the moral of the story in The Rainbow Fish; it was also the moral in Rainbow Fish to the Rescue. Why Mr. Pfister felt it necessary to bludgeon the reader over the head with it yet again in Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale is truly beyond me. It wouldn't really bother me - after all, there's nothing wrong with reminding children as well as adults that it's good to be nice - except the writing itself in Big Blue Whale is so poor. As in Rainbow Fish to the Rescue, Big Blue Whale feels rushed and slipshod, as if the author threw together any old story in order to make a deadline. Even a simple, predictable and cliched story can still be well-written and enjoyable; unfortunately, Big Blue Whale is all of the former and neither of the latter. Save your money and stick to the original Rainbow Fish."
3,Oceans Alive,"Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale (Rainbow Fish)Purchased this book for our Oceans Alive museum teacher at her request. I haven't received any feedback from her about the book. The book was in good condition when received. Purchased several other books about the same subject at that time. All were in good condition. Everything I've purchased from Amazon I've been pleased with. There's a great deal of selections to choose from and the price is always good. Since our museum is a non-profit organization I'm always looking to save money.Thank you,Joyce"
3,Not as good as the first...,"I'm so glad to see that people aren't in an outrage about this part of the series. I, personally, was a huge fan of the first Rainbow fish book, and my little sister loves ""Rainbow Fish to the rescue"", but the third enstallment just wasn't as good. I founf myself getting extremely bored as I read it. Basically the fish are all afraid of this big whale thats been watching them from afar. So the usual jerk ""The fish with the jagged fins"", says that he thinks that whale wants to eat them. So the whale gets angry, and unessacairly scares the fish buy chasing thme around. Why shouldn't they be scared, some whales do eat fish. I just thought it was a bad lesson. But overall, it was ok."
4,Rainbow Fish swims to another victory!,"I truly enjoyed the story of Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale by Marcus Pfister. It shares a valuable lesson once again for children not to judge by looks alone. Still I find that something must have got lost in the translation, such as the part in the beginning of the one striped fish without a glittering silver scale. Beautifully illustrated as always. Marcus this one's another winner!"
4,"Great Quality, Good fit","I like this steering wheel but be aware of the diameter, it may be an inch smaller than your stock wheel. I think mine was 14"" but this wheel is only 13"" or something close to that. Also some of the rivet nuts were slightly loose and the plastic piece was not centered between the two steel halfs of the wheel. It was an easy fix with an allen wrench to readjust everything, then retighten or tighten all of the allen head screws. Now the wheel looks and fits perfect.The horn button was a bit challenging to twist and turn over the spring, so I used a piece of yellow/beige masking tape to help grip the chrome without marring or scratching it."
1,False Advertisement,"The description's dimensions are incorrect unless they sent me the wrong steering wheel. The dimensions read 15 inches by 15 inches by 5 inches. I received 13""X13""X3"". I already have this size and I wanted a larger diameter steering wheel. I measured it after I mounted it...duh! Lesson learned."
1,Steering Wheel,"I always wanted one back in the day. Ordered one for my current project car and it is great. Only thing, the center logo sticker was missing. I guess someone at the warehouse had sticky fingers. To keep from having to go through the hassle of returning to Amazon and waiting for a new one, I emailed the Grant company to see if I could get it directly from them. They responded quickly and said they would mail one to me. I still haven't seen it. I have decided to replace it with the logo from my center caps on my car. I have to order new ones anyway and will just get an extra one."
3,..,Did received the product pictured as a gift and it does work as a roux whisk. The down side is that it can pretty much ONLY be used for this. I prefer a whisk that can be be used for a variety of tasks.
1,Product not the same as the picture.,"The Calphalon roux whisk is a flat whisk, not a full whisk as pictured. I was very disappointed when it arrived. It is not suitable for the things I hoped to use it for."
1,Garbage,Does not boost energy at all! This product is just a waist of money because the makers of this product are counting on a placebo effect to sell this product.
3,I'm not sure why it doesn't work for me,"I've been taking this stuff for about a week now. I take one in the morning and then one in the afternoon/evening, or before I go to the gym. I have not noticed much of an energy increase, except for when I try to go to sleep. I have the most difficult time falling asleep, and I didn't have that problem before. I want to keep trying it to see if it will work for me, but I don't know how many more sleepless nights I can endure. It's almost 1:30am and here I am writing this review, wide awake from the neck up, but too physically tired to really do much of anything."
5,Awesome stuff. Shipped fast!,This stuff really works. And it got to my house a couple days before I thought it would. Definitely recommended.
5,RIPPED FUEL X5,"WE ARE VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. IT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH GREAT RESULTS. WE AREN'T OVERLY OVERWEIGHT, SO TRYING TO LOSE THE EXTRA POUNDS IS ALOT HARDER. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!"
2,Is This Thing Working?,"I took these over a period of a couple weeks. While working out a bit more than usual and taking these, I did lose some weight. Unfortunately, I cannot contribute the weight loss to these pills. I honestly did not see any noticeable effect from taking this supplement. I can't say for sure that it didn't do anything, I just cannot pinpoint any effect it had on me or my metabolism."
2,No difference,It is very hard to review a product such as this one. Can I say I noticed a difference by taking this product? No not really. The product does not live up to its title.
4,Good Results in a Short Time Frame,"Taking 2 tablets per day as directed, this 40 count bottle only lasts about 3 weeks, but I was able to notice a decrease in some of my stubborn fat areas. I also lost a couple of pounds without changing my diet or increasing my exercise program. Best of all, these tablets didn't upset my stomach, make me jittery or give me any digestive problems. All in all, I think this is a good value."
4,Non coffee drinkers beware,"Unlike the majority of reviewers I am not a coffee drinker (yes I know that is un-American, but I also do not have a Costco membership). I do drink a couple of diet cokes in a day but that amounts to about 70 mg of caffeine in a day. At 99 mg of caffeine per pill this is a substantial increase in my caffeine intake and I notice it almost immediately.During the first week of taking these pills I did feel a boost in energy for about 3-4 hours. Unfortunately, after that came a wicked crash. If I don't take the second pill immediately upon feeling the effects of the crash I will barely be able to keep my eyes open. Non-coffee drinkers should be aware of this and take these with caution.Without changing my diet or excercise routine I managed to drop 2 pounds in the first week. That is all I have lost and I am going into my third week.If you are looking for an energy booster and you want to avoid the energy frinks this is not a bad substitute."
3,SURE FIRE WEIGHT LOSS? TRY THIS,"Want to lose weight?Do this.Cut out all wheat-based products.Drink 8 glasses of water daily.Walk briskly 25 minutes in the morning and again in the evening.No food after 5PM.And try RIPPED FUEL 5X.I've lost 10 pounds in less than 2 weeks.Ingredients in RIPPED FUEL 5X are:Thiamine, Niacin, Pyridoxine, Vitamin B12, Calcium, Chromium, Caffiene (99mg)Also includes: Baical skullcap root and black catechu bark, free b-ring flavanoids and black pepper root extract (total 130mg).Also: Cayenne fruit, Rhodiola root extract, cinnamom bark and ginger root extract (total 198mg).Good luck."
2,Mood altering,"The first day I used this product, everything was fine. The second day, I became very emotional and felt out of control. I stopped using, and was fine from then on. I may try again using just once a day and see if I get the same results."
2,They are pretty weak,"They dont work for me, I hardy see a difference when I take them, the Extreme work better for me."
3,Ok product,"I'm on my, I think, third bottle. The engergy is not a ""WoW"" factor for me, but I do get some adrenaline. It says to take before meals, but not how long to wait after taking the pill when you should intake food. I have gotten some slight stomach pains at times; that's taking it on an empty stomach. My weight is not melting off, I do work out 5-6 days a week with some bands work on equipment similar to Total Gym with the bands, and 30 minutes on an eliptical machine. I'm male, 5'9"" and around 168, 170ish and always had an athletic build. So I guess It may be work as far as me maintaining my weight, eventhough I would like to get at least in the 155 range."
3,I didn't see any results but....,"I've been on a weight mgmt plan since Jan 1 2008, training in the gym 4x per week and eating about 1200 cals a day. I took this product as suggested, but didn't see any differences in weight loss. Energy wise the caffeine in it seemed to help, but perhaps you have to take it longer to see results, each bottle is just 20 day supply. So the verdict is not in yet on it, it would be better to have a month or two supply, so that I could evaluate it better."
2,Wonder Drug or Excess Stomache Acid?,"I tried this product out as best I could. I waited until I would have a full 3 weeks to go to the gym religiously and eat properly. I then followed the dosage instructions to a tee. Unfortunately, I saw and felt very little effect from this supplement. It is a great concept, but it just didn't do anything for me. Not recommended..."
3,Pretty Good,"Tried this for about 2 weeks. Overall, it seemed to be a pretty good at keeping my energy up. I instantly (well about 20 mins after) felt 'ready to go' , work out, do stuff etc. Not to the point where I felt jumpy though, like some of the other ""amp up ""metabolism stims. Plus on the energy boost withgout feeling like you're on some kind of caffeine binge.However, one thing I wanted to point out was that the next day, major downtime in waking up. Much harder than anything else I tried. You would think that with less caffeine it would be the other way around (less energy, less down time afterwards, but it seemed to be completely opposite). All in all, seemed to work ok. Would prob have to try it on a longer term to nitice a major difference in weight loss.. I did burn 4 lbs in the 2 weeks, whereas normally, I lose a lb or two if I keep the same diet."
3,Energy - Yes; Definition - No,"I just finished my 20-day routine of taking two of these pills daily. One with breakfast, the other with dinner. I can safely say that the pills do give you energy -- and not just caffeinated energy. I know they gave me the stamina I needed to make it through the evening and get things done. I was pleased to see that some of the energy boost did not come from caffeine, what many pills use. Granted, there is caffeine in these but there is also other ingredients that help generate energy as well.As far as definition, or adding muscle, I really didn't notice any. I do lift weights and try to walk 3-4 miles per day. However, besides giving me the energy to complete these tasks, I really couldn't notice much of anything else.So, overall, I rate them at around 75% for their stamina ability. A good alternative for those who don't want to be pumped up on caffeine alone."
4,Surprisingly effective.,"Never did I ever think I would be giving this a good review. But it is simply great for energy. It's not really a diet pill, but certainly would promote exercise easier. I have not taken it long enough to assume it has weight loss benefit. I do drink energy drinks often, and I did find by taking these that I had not had any. So, figuring this bottle is a 20 day supply, and drinks are about 2 bucks a pop, this saves a few dollars, and it is obviously healthier. Expect nothing from trying it, and you will see the benefit."
4,A good 'pep' pill,"TwinLab's ""Ripped Fuel 5X"" is a decent little diet/energy pill that sets out to provide everything you'd expect from such a product and for the most part, in my opinion, achieves the desired effect in most instances.+Energy Booster: kept me well fueled throughout a 2 hour session of full court hoops.+Weight Loss: Time will tell, but the desired energy boost that it provides will ensure a greater intensity throughout your workouts.+Appetite Suppressant: Does curb appetite to a degree but their are more effective products for such purposes.For those in need of such effects it'd be hard to argue against giving this product a try. Ripped Fuel 5X is also convenient in its delivery with a recommended dosage of 2 pills per day. Other such products will oftentimes recommend doses of anywhere from 6 - 12 pills per day. Currently at Amazon's discounted price ($16-17 range) its well worth a purchase in comparison to paying the full MSRP at your local GNC Store."
4,4 1/2 Stars,"I've used these off and on for about three weeks. I can see why some peopleget jittery, especially if they are not used to caffeine, etc.These give me a heck of a lot of energy. I've noticed when I take one (Yes that's all I take) I get a much better workout and feel great afterwards.Recommended for people who can't seem to get motivated and need a little boost."
3,"Energy, For Sure","After taking half of TwinLab Ripped Fuel Metabolism, I can say that while I have not noticed any weight-loss or added musculature, my energy level has certainly increased. Most mornings I start my day at 5 a.m and am usually dragging by 9 a.m. However, since I started the tablets there has been an increase in energy. I take on tablet before breakfast and the second tablet prior to lunch and I am quite energetic throughout my ten hour work day. So, for the energy component alone I recommend this product.Angelia Menchan"
5,Simple yet profound,"The concepts put forth in this book are not earth shattering theology. They are simple principles taught in Scripture, expounded in a very engaging manner. Principles that are seldom really practiced in our day to day interactions with other people. This book deals much of what comes out of our mouth, and I believe the title is rather self-explanitory.This would be an excellent book to use in Bible studies at home or at Church, and if you were to follow the principles established in this book, you would see your life revolutionized (a word I do not use lightly)."
4,From Chalice Press:,"The editors have orchestrated a cornucopia of insightful rationale and then homiletic models for those who preach from the Psalms. A perspective on the Psalms is provided by the premier Psalms scholars of the time. The sermonic examples are exegetically solid and creative. Some of the authors are Walter Brueggemann, J. Clinton McCann, Paul Scott Wilson, and others."
4,Classical works with sounds of the ocean,"Great buy here--four cd's with favorite classical tunes mixed with the sounds of the ocean. CD 1--Musical Sea of Tranquility includes harp, 25 melodies. CD 2--Romantic Sea of Tranquility, with acoustic guitar and 25 more tunes. CD 3--Seductive Sea of Tranquility, saxophone. CD 4--Calming Sea of Tranquility, Woodwind and Guitar. Each cd offers relaxation music but with different instrumentation to suit your mood. Some of the tunes are classical and some are folk tunes like ""My Old Kentucky Home."""
2,"For Jule Styne ""completists"" only","This show closed during the ""preview period - i.e. it never officially opened on Broadway. Listening to the recording you can get an idea why - it is certainly not vintage Jule Styne, although, as always with him, the score definitely has its moments.The packaging is very basic, and does not include a storyline, cast list, or anything about the history of the musical, including any mention of its extremely short ""run"".Still, given that it's not likely to be available for long, or ever again, JUST worth buying anyway for any great Jule Styne fan (or any really obsessive musicals collector) who can't bear not having everything available from this major composer."
3,LOVE TKO,LOVE TKO IS THE HOTTEST TRACC ON THIS ALbUMHANDS DOWN.THE REST OF THE SONGS TO ME FALL INTOTHE SAME pLACE.THE ORIGINAL TKO TRACC CAME FROMTEDDY P...JUST TA LET YOU KNOW.
5,Just keeps getting BETTEr,"I bought this CD yesterday, as I am a huge fan, but was surprised again by her new range, and the quality of the songs chosen. Very impressive and wonderful to listen to in the car!"
4,A Great BETTE,"Bette Midler is a wonderful talent and this album proves that (as if it hadn't already been proven!). She has a wonderful ear for great material and that also is shown on this great album. Tackling Teddy Pendergrass' LOVE TKO is no easy feat and the Divine Miss M doesn't disappoint, offering a compassionate take on a fabulous song.Having heard Lalah Hathaway and Joe Sample's version of ""When Your Life Was Low"" and loving the song as I do, I was interested in how Bette would approach the song which is steeped in jazz vocal. Her voice is amazing on this song and it makes you long for a sugar-free radio wave that would send this tune through stereo speakers everywhere.This album offers great songs and a Bette Midler that is in excellent voice and at her interpretive best. How wonderful it is for us to have Bette on TV, in the movies and in our CD players. She is truly one of the greatest talents we have, and as I said earlier, this album proves that!"
2,Have seen BETTE-R days!!!,"OK! I've let time pass before I wrote this review to be fair. It seems the buying public has the answer. It didn't stay on the chart for more 13 weeks and peaked just below #60. That's not too bad without any airplay. But with a mediocre television series and all the bad publicity it's been getting, she has become a bad parody of herself. I hope she can get back up again! But this CD is not the pick-me-up she delivered. She truly needs a gay man with incredible taste to guide her openly in her descision making and choosing the ""right"" tracks. Her best BET(TE), would be, to rush release some re-mixes of some of these tracks to rebute the CD. Perhaps even add the re-mixes as bonus tracks like Ricky Martin is doing to boost his sales up. Re-mix TKO or Imagination! The hottest tracks on here are Heartaches and the late Kristy MacCall's great In These Shoes!"
3,Could Have Been BETTE-R,"While the disc does grow on you, this is Bette's schmaltzier side, replete with underwhelming, overly styled songs. Salvation, when it comes, is classic Bette--""In These Shoes"" is wonderful; but there is not the magic of this CD's predecessor--the magical ""Bathhouse Betty"". Always a strong deliverer on covers, Bette seems to miss the mark here except on her light ""Shining Star"". Since she is just such a star, I was expecting more--but given the countless winners she's had in the past, this will nicely fill out your Bette collection."
3,Good Bette,"well, after few listen to it I decided that I should share my view with other Better fanz. Like many others I have been a fan since young. I listen to her since ten years old. Her voice just touches my heart till now ... my heart still aches when I listen to some of her slow songs... :)I throughly enjoyed Bathhouse Betty. But this one I am afriad I gotta say I am a little disappointed. In my opinion, some songs are weak and there is only one fun song ""In These Shoes"". And yes I love ""Just My Imagination"" she had done a very good job here.These two songs are more than enough to justify your reasons for buying this CD. Go get it and discover the other gems yourself!"
2,Not liking it all that much...,"It could just be because I haven't listened to the album a lot of times but I don't think this is going to be a favourite Bette album of mine. I like the fact that Bette is happy and seems to have found her true self but I wish there was a bit more zany Bette in this album! Like Bathhouse Betty! I think she really should have added a little more zest to the album. There are some beautiful songs on the album though. I just find the songs are all a bit slow and sound a like. I like a distinct difference in every song. Although if you are a die hard Bette Midler fan, I would suggest buying the album."
4,Bette is DIVINE!!!,"I just want to encourage Bette fans to go out and buy this CD and encourage others to do so as well! Most of the songs are beautifully orchestrated, produced and sung in Bette's signature style! The only missteps on this album in my opinion are 2 tracks. Numbers 4 and 8. Her version of Smokey Robinson's ""Just My Imagination"" is too slow and sort of drowned out by the musicians. ""Color of Roses"" is a pretty ballad but does not compare to others! Her shining moments are on ""In These Shoes"", ""Moses"", ""Nobody Else But You"" and ""Bless You Child""!!! GO BUY IT!=)"
2,"Dull, boring","I have been a Bette fan for a zillion years. I love her campy, brash style and her ability to sing a variety of music from ballads,jazz, blues, big band, you name it. I wonder if old age is settling in because this album has none of the flair and energy that was on ""Bathhouse Betty"" which definately was a 5 star album. Bette, don't let these old fogey agents tell you what to sing! Pick your own material and stay away from the boring, unimaginative material. Her rendition of ""Gypsy"" was far better. I recommend it over this album."
2,Maybe next shipment ?,"I never imagined that I'd give a 2 stars rating to a 10 stars diva, but Bette, what happened? Most of the tracks sound like Ms Bette trying to reinvent Motown all over again. But hits come in cycles and I'm pretty patient enough to expect a hit album soon...meanwhile, I'll take the TKO and ..you guessed right.....lull...zzzzzz"
2,Middle of The Road,I Respect Bette Midler but this Cocktail&Peanuts take on Songs Like Love T.K.O&Just My Imagination(Running Away from Me) aren't Happening.She is a Better Artist than the Material That is Presented Here.But Safe Middle OF The Road&CBS is Where She is Now.
2,betty miller?,"a soundtrack for a G rated sitcoma great choice of songwriters: bachrach/costello, beth nielsen chapman, womack & womack, norman whitfield/barret strong, patty griffina safe performancea smooth vanilla productionwho is this......?? betty miller???"
5,Milestone,"Another milestone release from the Cloudwatch/Ultraworld bunch. Fabulous stuff, execptionaly well produced. No modern collection should be without this release.(Note: the Producer - Alan (Fluid) Parry - is my first born, his mum and I are delighted and proud of this and his previous works). Love you son!"
5,Beautiful and nostalgic,"As a long time CW attendee and having been there to see a good percentage of the artists represented on the CD I have to say that LG and Fluid have captured the feeling of CouldWatch wonderfully. As with the event, the soundscape is lush and enveloping. It's the closest to the real thing that I could hope for (if you haven't been to a CloudWatch you haven't lived!) .....cheers!"
2,Einstein : How I veiw the world,"PBS really missed an opportunity to present a great story. Although we found the content to be informative and fastinating, we had to stop watching halfway through because of the horrid overriding ""music"" that accompanied most of the oral discussion. It was aweful! We'll try the Nova production to learn more about Albert Einstein."
3,OK,It's a breaker. A breaker is a breaker. I have yet to find one brand that is that much superior to another.
2,biased,"In my opinion this book is biased against Richard 111 and not as acurate as one might be led to expect in a ""historian"".Mr Hicks seems to have a down on Richard.Their are many other books which will give a better perspective on Richard and I have read a good number."
4,Richard III (by Michael Hicks),"The book is well-written, in a scholarly manner. I was disappointed that the author takes the traditionalist (anti-Ricardian) stance. However, overall, I think it is well done."
4,Everything you need in a mixer for beginners,"I definitely recommend this mixer if you are a new-intermediate DJ looking for something with good quality for a low price. XLR outputs so you can plug them into powered speakers. Full EQ kills are great for mixing. No effects, but that's what's expected from a low end mixer. Lightweight makes it easy to carry to a gig. Only problem I had is the cross fader got very sticky after about 6 months of use. I bought some Deoxit lubricant from guitar center and sprayed and it was just like new again."
2,Barely worth the time to read,"The book talks too much about the author's life and his father. Very little about the games. Some of the material is based upon interviews with former Colts that were conducted for the author. Some of the information about the Colts before 1952 (when they were the Dallas Texans), and particularily the Colts of the AAFC I had not heard before, but it makes up just a few pages of the book."
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST,William Gildea is a stellar author who really portrays what football was like in the 1950s. He shows how the Colts went from bottom to top. He talks about how football was associated with his family and how he never missed a game. Gildea wrote the best sports book I have ever read.
4,Nice book with loving memories,"The author must have had so many good memories while writing this book. It is the story of the Baltimore Colts of the 1940's to 1950's mostly but it is also the story of the love of the game and how close it made the author and his father.The city of Baltimore adopted the Colts as their own when the team first arrived there and the devotion of the city was something that the players felt and gave back.Part auto-biography, part sports book, this is a book well worth owning."
3,Doesn't harden,"I have used regular paraffin previously, the addition of tea tree oil interested me. I admit the moisture from the oils are nice, but, for me, the product stays too soft to easily remove. If that doesn't matter to you, by all means use this."
3,ambitious short stories that experiment with form,"Hear Us O Lord contains a variety of story forms which Lowry attempted, and some themes which will be familiar to readers of his other works. Such stories as The Forest Path to the Spring and others are an integral part of his ouevre. A wonderful story about the dungeons of Pompeii - forgive me forgetting the story name for I've lost my copy - is the other highlight of the book. Even where the story is secondary to the form, as in Through the Panama, Lowry achieves some success - we must remember the time at which these stores were written, and I don't think I've seen this type of experimentation dating from this period. On the whole HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, I've only given just 3 stars because of its flaws. If you;re lucky enough to find a copy, maybe you;ll get the beauiftul cover of a woodcut with Christ ushering in the rainstorm in the distance."
4,Not a Direct fit for the 4100 but Doable and Worth the Effort,"First, I'd like to say the PW948 insert is a quality piece and well worth the price. It is so much better than the junky thin one sold by Bosch or the plywood one I made. It will fit the 4000 perfectly but since the 4100 has the riving knife you will have to either remove the knife, which I do not recommend or extend the clearance slot in the back for the riving knife with a router, or a hand saw. I chose the router method since I have a router table and reasonable skill to rout the slot. I used a 1/8"" straight cutting bit and routed to about 1/2"" from the back of the insert. I suspect you could cut all the way to the end since the insert is made from a tough and stable UHMW plastic. It works perfectly and does not burn or melt like the Bosch insert did. To cut small pieces on any table saw without a zero clearance insert or a sled is inviting injury, believe me I know. Kudos to Amazon and Peachtree Woodworking Supply."
2,Ok for a while...,"My insert does not stay flat. It also falls out of the saw if I tip the saw up (the Bosch brand ones have a clip). It does level out nicely (when it was flat), but I will be making my own in the future."
1,Bowed in middle,"Everything everyone said about this was pretty much correct, except mine came bowed in the middle, in other words a high spot in the middle.Terrible quality control. I read other reviews other places many said the same thing. One guy bot three and all came bowed. Buyer bewarebecause you don't know what you'll get."
3,It's ok if you have no prior knowledge of anatomy,This book is very simple. I had to giggle as I was reading this because they would insert the definition of body parts and their functions along the way.
2,SIMPLE is the key word here,"This book is hilarious, it's like it was written for five year olds who got pregnant somehow and don't know anything about the female reproductive system. Check out this quote from page three.""The uterus (sometimes called the womb) is a bag made of thick muscles. It is located in the pelvis behind the bladder (where urine or pee collects) and in front of the rectum (where your poop comes out).""There are also these anecdotes throughout the book like ""Cami's Story"" or ""Jenny's Story"" and they talk about their stupid boyfriends who don't want to be in the room during labor or how they kept trying to smoke around their pregnant ladies.Seriously though, about 65% of the book is about the process of labor with no information really about fetal development which is what I am most interested in as labor isn't going to be the majority of time spent in my pregnancy."
2,Somewhat Twisted,"Though you may not believe it, I'm actually from the home town of the Dahms. When I saw this video I sorta found it a little sickening yet erotic because although it is three sisters, they are three beautiful women. But sisters just shouldn't do that stuff. It's almost like a brother doing it with his sister with some blind sex addiction between the two. If you can ignore the sister factor, then buy it. Personally, however, I think that they looked just as hot before they became plastic."
2,"Equus 8262 2"" Electric Water Temperature Gauge","If i had to do it all over again, I would not purchase this brand. I bought 5 gauges and have replaced three of them already via the manufacturer"
2,VERY SMALL CROSS,I was surprised when this arrived how very tiny it is. it is lovely - just much smaller than I had expected.
5,A great watch,"It is now 2 years since I bought it and it looks just as good with accuracy that is excelent,I did change the baterry 6 months ago and it costed me 3 dollars."
2,Painting Duck Decoys (crudely),"If you're looking for a super-accurate detail-oriented definitive authority on duck plumage, you won't find it in ""Painting Duck Decoys..."" The 24 color plates within could've been done by any budding high school art student. If not crude, they are at best poor approximations, not terribly useful for anyone concerned with painting decoys realistically. Perhaps the proportions of the ducks depicted will be of use to some. But most serious artists will undoubtedly find much more accurate information in books featuring photographs rather than the amateurish paintings in ""Painting Duck Decoys..."""
1,"If this book is helpful, then you shouldn't be in business!","Wanting tips on setting up a business plan I purchased this book hoping to glean a few useful pointers. After reviewing for few minutes this badly reproduced (on a poor quality copier; yes really) pages and forms I was disappointed. It has many forms that appear to have been produced prior to the computer age, which is humorous in that with the purchase of this ""book"" you are on the author's mailing list for updates. One has to wonder what the ""updates"" would include. As for the text it's self, I have seen better-organized and more comprehensive reports from high school students. Instead of purchasing this book, spend a few hours on the web researching the subjects of interest. It will have been time better spent and money not wasted."
3,An oral intrigue into Kerouac's and the Beats,"Gifford and Lee, seemingly well read about the Beats and Keoruac, are second only to Ann Charter's biographical work on Kerouac. The real sense of the'50's, the mentality, the hazards, and the activities of Burrows, Ginsberg,Jack and the boys are given a very thorough and entertaining once over. The scholarly merit isn't here, but the titilation and interesting skinny is."
4,nice movie,"Great scenery, interesting story and characters. Makes you want to take the hike youself, of course, without the grief. It made me research more on ""The Way of St James"" and its increasing popularity."
4,"Won't change your life, but may leave you feeling a bit better about it","So much better than I anticipated. The movie develops its story and the relationships in the story naturally and unhurriedly - any rushing of these relationships would have betrayed the nature of the character Sheen plays and the journey he is on. Every time the story seems about to veer into the maudlin it dodges a bit to the side, remaining truthful and human. The movie is a little about change and a lot about self-acceptance. It won't change your life, but it will likely leave you feeling a bit better about it."
3,It has been edited from the original,"This is my 2nd time around for the movie...I had enjoyed it the 1st time, even though Martin Sheen is not my favorite. I had found the deep need each of the hikers showed at the rock pile in the original very moving and realistic...but obviously not politically correct to the ones who edited it. Shame on you."
2,"A good hike, you probably have to be there",Interesting tale. Subtle way of expressing the spiritual power of christanity. Modernist like to bash Christianity as an old faith dictated by old men in fancy gowns. This tale shows that the faith is an individual experience. A quest to discover life . To live. And the clever thing is that people do not even know they are living the life Christ wants of us. It has always been about discovery. seek and you shall find.
5,Look for the way,"I will make a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela next month. I appreciate the story told about ""the way."" Unlike much of the junk on the market today it is told in loving and emotional terms but without streams of profanity and gratuitous sex. You need to see it. The Botafumeiro is marvelous."
4,How to Deal,"Certain life events* make us re-examine our axioms, and losing a loved one is probably the most common. This gem of a film explores how one person's family loss becomes a catalyst for the discarding of some axioms in favor of others. The transformation is not forced, the characters are believable, and the film is not condescending even though plenty of opportunities exist. A great spiritual film for all, without being heavy-handed.* E.g., sickness, accident, divorce, imprisonment."
5,First amazon review ever,"I have never in many years of using amazon ever written a review. I only read them. However, this movie is extraordinary and I had to make an exception. All I can say is that it is masterfully well-done and touching. Everyone should see it. I truly would like to experience The Way myself. Should have won an Oscar."
4,The Way,"The movie was excellent, very true to the actual pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. Martin Sheen once again does a phenomenal job. And great to see Emilio Estevez portray his son in the movie"
5,Revelatory and absorbing,"As Sheen says in the introduction , this is a story of aa father and a son but it also the story of how people become themselves . It becomes as hard to put down as a thriller in which artists explore they live and how their art & vision is shaped by them and each other. It is also how these sometimes parallel journeys through existence echo each others struggle to understand how to meld spirit & desire and the quest for the meaning of life."
3,Too artsy,Nice movie but it never gets to the point. It tries to be too artsy and too cute. Nice scenery and it has moments of pathos. But in the end it is a dud.
2,ok movie,"ok movie, not great, not memorable. it was a good distraction for an hour or so, but candidly, i can't remember much of it 2 weeks later."
3,Tape section missing,"There was a 3 minute of tape with sound but no picture, I just fast forward and the rest was okay. Movie was good!"
3,Is the a bootleg DVD?,"This is the only DVD I have that required me to correct my computer to Region 1 prior to playback.Sometimes during playback, blue light flashes appeared all along the bottom of the screen.Does this mean that that this is a bootleg DVD?"
2,The way -Intersting but disappointing film,"The WayAn interesting but disappointing film. Debora who was suffering from the loss of her little girl by her abortion should have at least named her child and then at the end rescued a little girl, only to discover that she had the same name. Martin Sheen should have been asking why his son was going on the pilgrimage and slowly found him self becoming more spiritual and finally realizing that his son was in a sense giving birth to the father. All of the characters should have been becoming more spiritual with the last scene having them in church before the altar. Throwing a person's ashes everywhere is strictly forbidden by the Catholic Church. There was a priest but given no importance. In the end the characters were still the same after the 800 Km walk and the pilgrimage did nothing for them. Wm. Paul Tasin"
3,a little slow but overall a good movie.,"this was good overall movie, it was a little slow moving and requires your attention to follow.i liked the fourth wiseman Better."
5,REMARKABLE!!!!,The most remarkable film I have seen in years. Dares to push back against the super-hero nonsense that Hollyweird is constantly shoving down our throats. Bravo to all those involved with the film. Martin Sheen is absolutely 5 STAR superb as Tom. Emilio - keep making more movies. We miss you on the screen!
5,"Inspiring, great scenery, makes you want to do Santiago Trail",My father has recently gone to Spain to do the trail and hearing his stories (and seeing pictures) made me want to watch the movie. It is a very inspiring story with good/mysterious characters and Martin Sheen gives it the quality it needs to get the message across. Scenery is beautiful. A must watch
5,Awesome,One of the best movies that I have seen in a long time.Inspiring... painful circumstances can sometimes make you a better person.
1,No Subtitles!,"It's hard to believe that a movie made in 2011 doesn't bother with those of us with hearing problems! Regardless of how good the movie is, I'll now need to watch it by myself, with the volume turned up so that it'll probably bother the neighbors across the street. Very disappointing -- and very cheap on the part of the producers!"
1,Way below the average.,"Terrible. Terrible acting. Terrible writing. Terrible timing. Yeah, the scenery was nice, but if I want that, I'm not going to rent a movie like this to get it. I really don't understand how this (sorry excuse for a) film got such high ratings on here."
1,The Way DVD,"This DVD was ordered twice and returned twice. Neither DVD would work in my DVD player, yet other DVDs worked just fine. Very disappointing!"
1,very poor,unable to play the DVD on a number of dvd players - do not know what the problem is - carol
2,NOT a religious movie!,"I rented this only because I thought it was religious - what a mistake. 4 totally secular people, getting to know each other and hiking - that is essentially it. Lots of eating, drinking, talking, walking, but not one of them seems to have thoughts of anything spiritual. It was a great disappointment. The scenery was gorgeous and Martin Sheen is a fine actor, but even on a technical movie level, it was long and boring.For anyone who wants to see a really powerful religious movie, see ""Octpob"", ""The Island""."
4,Excellent Journey,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does get a little long, but then again it does an impressive job of showing change in the characters as gradual and realistic. Some might find watching actors walk a trail for 2 hours boring, but as a former backpacker, I loved the journey. While it is a story about characters struggling with their Catholic faith, the story resonates across faiths. Excellent movie for a small budget effort."
5,Uplifting,"Feeling depressed, and wondering about your faith and that of the world? I can't stop watching this movie. It makes me smile and hopeful. Great family movie for a change, definately funny, touching and soul rejuvenating."
4,Worth your time,"Starts slow, never moves fast, but is well worth the time to watch. WARNING: you will spent the next several weeks (perhaps months or longer) contemplating your own life and where it is headed after watching this. One of the most inspiring movies I've seen in years."
5,Inspiring,A truly inspirational movie. A moving spiritual (not necessarily religious) experience. Well written with excellent characterization. A peaceful and thoughtful movie which causes one to reflect deeply on one's own life. Makes me want to do the Camino.
5,The Way was a pleasant surprise,"This movie was a pleasant surprise. A father finds out that his son had died while on a pilgrimage to a church in Spain that houses the remains of one of Jesus' apostles. After traveling to Spain to collect his sons remains, Martin Sheen's character decides to walk the 500+ mile journey with his son's cremains, so his son can complete the spiritual journal. . It's a touching movie that explores a father's grief and regrets. It doesn't beat you over the head with its religious themes, and it's not really an orthodox Catholic movie. But it still will leave you with a ""warm and fuzzy"" feeling inside. It's nice to see a movie that doesn't insult Catholic Christians, and can be enjoyed by both believers and nonbelievers alike."
4,THE WAY,I have read a few books on The Way and found the movie a good representation on what I had read. My feet and perhaps finances wouldn't allow this pilgrimage and I loved the glimpses of the countryside. The added breakdown of the movie by the actors was great.
4,The Way HD rental,Amazon video prime rental rocks! Such a convenience to pick and choose movies for home viewingThe Way was Inspiring thought provoking video with Martin Sheen..makes you want to walk The Way to find rebirth..perfect time of year for viewing as we approach Lent..
4,Uplifting,"There was something simplistic about the movie, but I found it meaningful. ""The Way"" is, of course, a metaphor for life and, in this instance, for finding yourself. In the course of finding himself, the protagonist finds reconciliation with his past, connection to others and a new path in life."
5,Has become one of my favorite movies...,I will only add my voice to the many others here...Emilio did an excellent piece of work with this film. The rich characters are superb. Please make more movies like this....the soundtrack is excellent. Buen Camino... this movie inspired me to want to walk the Camino...so that says something...
4,A happy accident,"When I saw this advertised on Amazon, I thought it said starring Michael Sheen, that dorky British guy everyone loves, but it actually said starring Martin Sheen, the kind of boring guy from ""West Wing"" I would never intentionally have paid money to see. BUT--I'm glad I did. This is a generous and well-made little film that I enjoyed immensely. I think it would have been better starring Michael Sheen, but regardless I'm glad I stayed with it."
5,The Way for me,"My wife and I saw this film. It had an unexpected influence on both of us. My Mom died at the end of September and while we always know they will go, it was difficult for me -- and I am 63. I think it is worse when the second one goes. So, we saw the film and I did a couple of things that I rarely do. First, I downloaded the music (remember I am 63 and don't do things like that usually). Then I bought a book about the Camino. Finally, we leave this late Spring for the trip."
5,Sweet and Moving,"Unlike conventional Hollywood entertainment, I found the Way to be engaging almost in a meditation kind of way as you follow the journey of a grief stricken father as he comes to terms with the loss of his son as he travels with other people on their life journeys. I found this movie quite touching."
5,A Must See Movie,Excellent movie! a journey through life and finding peace... you see a man wrapped up in the business world find what's really important in life through a journey his son planned.
5,***The road not taken,"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,I took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.--Robert FrostI was profoundly affected by this movie and the brilliant performance by Martin Sheen. The reasons that people take the pilgrimage to St. James are not as important as the spiritual journey. This movie will renew your faith in the process of redemption."
4,The Way (DVD),I went to this movie when it was in the theatres. I liked it so much that I decided to buy it - truly a worthwhile movie to watch.
4,THE WAY,"the story, the acting and the landscape, is one of those movies that leave you a profound message. I really recommend this movie THE WAY."
5,The Way...a journey,"This movie is very thoughtfully produced and directed and the actors do a wonderful job of portraying each of their personal journeys as they travel together alongthe El Camino. I have told everyone about it so that they, too, can share the beauty of this work of art."
5,Wow an amazing film!,"I would go anywhere to watch Martin Sheen read the phone book, and I have found he is at his best when he works with one of his sons. This film is his best work yet with his son Emilio as not only his film son, but his director.On top of it all, it's one of the prettiest films I have seen in YEARS! A must see!When you done with the film I recommend the book the father and son wrote together....Great stuff!"
5,The way for all of us,"I'm so tired to see ""special effects movies""... so boring!!! Suddenly I saw this fantastic movie!!! I'd like to see more films like this... It has an good story, wonderful scenes, special acting cast, not disturbing music... It's rare. You must see..."
4,"Excellent, feel good movie","This story of a man walking the Camino de Santiago is just great. It is a feel good movie, it's emotional at times, it describes a great tradition, and though most people think it has a heavy catholic message, it really stays very neutral and focuses on individual personal reasons why people walk this trail. I highly recommend it with a pizza and some wine."
5,The Way,"This is a wonderful, uplifting movie. A great message without being preachy. The acting is outstanding, the photography and scenery fantastic. We saw it on Netflex and liked it so much that we ordered our own DVD from Amazon so we could share it with friends and family; we rarely buy movies but this is exceptional. Too bad it didn't get more publicity and only played in one theater in our area. Well worth the time and money to see it."
5,"I heard about the Santiago Pilgrimage from a friend whose husband is a minister, and he discovered the movie.","This is a wonderfully inspiring film, with an intimate look at the""Camino""....a walking route from southern France through northern Spain to Santiago de Campostella on the coast. It is a true pilgrimage, and I felt I was walking it along with the characters, all of whom are very well-portrayed. This film, with its stunning cinematography, touches the deepest parts of our emotions, and we ask ourselves for whom or for what we would make such a challenging month-long journey."
5,Best film; soul searching and funny; breath taking and challenging all in one,"To imagine the feelings of out living your children is a fear of most parents.yet when Daniel Avery dies on the first day of a pilgrimage his father must battle these emotions.Upon identifying the body he starts out to...well, that is the beauty of the film.Every one who travels the road has a purpose, and it is for themselves... yet what is it?To finish for his son? To reconcile with his son in spirit? To find himself? To find God? To learn to be a friend? To learn what it means to have a friend?That is the beauty of the film. You will find your self taking this pilgrimage with the characters and identifying with them, living through them.I have seen this film multiple times, and yet each and everytime I see something new in it.Simply, powerfully, superb.."
5,Awesome father/son movie,I enjoyed the father/son connection as well as the adventure of the story.A heart warming aventure that makes you reflect on life.
4,My dad Loved it,"My dad studied in north of spain and he knows well il ""camino de santiago"". He said that it is good movie and the sightseen is amazing."
4,"Grat movie, great message!","Though some parts may seem slow moving, it mirrors the ever-changing pace of our lives. I liked the movie.Enjoyable journey!"
5,Community,"This is a beautiful movie. Walking this pilgrimage has been a long-time dream of mine, but the movie had more to do with strangers building community. Estevez did a wonderful job of making this a memorable journey."
4,The Way,Very good cast. A journey toward Wholeness and healing through faithand community. Beautifully cinomatic with breathtaking views ofSpain. A touching story about the turmoiltuus relationship of a father andhis son.
4,Great scenery,Great scenery and theme make up for slim plot. I watch this movie 2-3 times per yr. my readings indicate that the movie gives an accurate depiction of el Camino
3,The Way is inspiring,"Not big budget, no effects, just a good story and and inspiring message that is not too treacly. Martin Sheen is wonderful and believable as the father who gradually comes to understand his son and his own purpose as he hikes the camino on the ancient pilgrimage to Saint James of Campostela. As others have noted, he breaks in rather easily to the rigors of the trip (makes it look a lot easier than I'm sure it is) but the tough battering is to his soul and spirit as he comes to understand his lost son. Few movies explore modern spiritual quests, and this is a brave, intriguing effort."
4,The Cathedral of St James,This is not about the journey but rather about the pilgrimage to seek a deeper grasp of one's spiritual journey. Hence the pictures as the end of the pilgrimage of The Cathedral of St James is the reward.
5,The story of trying to learn about your child but learning more about yourself along THE WAY,"For anyone who knows you learn something from everyone you meet and every experience you embrace, this is the story of a man who didn't know his son, or himself, and this physical/spiritual journey helped him start living life for the first time. This is a great film for anyone caught in the struggle where they can't break out of their comfort zone and can't embrace all life has in store because they are doing what they think they're supposed to be doing. This is also a good film for someone who has lost a child or lost sight of what matters."
1,Poor,DVD nit in good shape. Only could play it one rime then got stuckDoesn't work niw. Doesn't play through to end
1,Ugh!,"What a piece of smarmy trash. I'm surprised anyone could watch this overly long movie and give it anything but at 0. Parts were interesting but the overall message was vapid and a mistake for the actors, all if whom I've liked in the past. Ugh! again!"
4,concise and clear,"This text is the ideal text for any student or interested reader who wants to find out about globalization. It presents the arguments of sceptics and advocates in social, economic and political domains. After you read this text, you are in a better position to make up your mind about the issue of globalization."
5,"Great product, great purchase, fast shipping! Thanks Amazon for making this happen!","Great product, great purchase, fast shipping! Our local Vallarta's Mexican Grocery Store actually had these @ a lower price, oh well. This is a must have , IF, you like to keep your tortillas ""nice and warm all the time!"" The beauty about this product is throw this and the tortillas in the microwave @ the same time, and bam! HOT tortillas.Thanks Amazon for making this happen!"
3,Not her best,Not one of her better albums. I love Bette and enjoy all h er songs and her movies. This album is only lukewarm. I didn't enjoy her choice of songs.
2,Camp Coconut,"i noticed this album is popular in denmark. hmmmm. ya gotta wonder... but i admit, this album has the best intro i've ever heard on any album EVER!!! the rest of the album is so much odd cheese that after the first listening, its more annoying than funny. but if you're a fan of kraftwork and have an odd sense of humor ie. you're a big doctor demento fan, then this album is ""para tu"". cha cha cha."
4,Acrylic Painting Techniques,found this boook extremely helpful in learning the techniques of acrylic painting
1,BEWARE when buying this CD !!!,"I recently bought this CD, but the version I got had only 11 songs on it....NOT 20 as advertised.THIS CD is Cotton's LP #1 only, the last 9 songs are missing !!!BEWARE !! BEWARE!!"
5,More than enough power.,"One thing about camcorders is that you need them to be ready when the need arises. This battery has so much power that unless you are shooting Gone With The Wind, it should last for days. When this battery is freshly charged, my Sony CX12 shows 480 minutes of record time on the screen. Wow, that's a lot of time. With the regular battery you really have to carry two in case you end up shooting more than a couple of hours. With this battery you don't even need to think about having enough power. On the down side, it does protrude a bit from the back of the camera, but it's worth it."
1,Not sure it was areal Sony battery,I already owned a Sony NPFH100 H Series Actiforce Hybrid InfoLithium Battery and wanted to get another one for an upcoming trip. The one that just arrived weighed about half of my original one. I knew something was wrong the minute I picked up the battery. I weighed it and also checked the Sony website. The battery should weigh 195g. The battery I received weighed 110g. I tried to contact the seller a 3rd party selling on Amazon but found no email or phone number on their about page. I decided to send it back after reading some other reviews about fake Sony batteries that also don't last very long. It was a great price but not if it isn't real. The writing on the back of the battery was a bit different from my original battery as well. Another reviewer says the back of battery should have the recycle and Sony 1-800 number. The new battery did not have that but the old one did. Be careful when ordering.
2,Disappointed in batteries,"1 of the 2 batteries didn't work at all, the other one shows only 200 minutes. I was disappointed in the purchase all around."
2,ok,i bougth this product because of the charge that will hold i tried and work but now my camera said that i canot use this battery with my camera which is a sony cx110 and the plasctic pins that hodl the battery into the camera they are bigger than the original battery.
3,Sony NPFH100,"Charged battery overnight and on my camera it only says ""218 minutes""Recharged and said roughly same amount, so not sure I will get the 10 hours others speak of."
1,Cheap knock-off! Beware!,This is not genuine sony battery. It's a cheap chinese knock-off. If battery doesn't have 1-800... number in the circle in the back it's not sony battery. Please BEWARE!. I bought and after about 3-4 months my camcorder stopped recognizing the battery.
1,"BAD, BAD, BATTERY!","Battery arrived in a Sony brand retail bubble package. It never took a charge, never worked, didn't display anything in my Sony HD SR11's screen like it should. Compared same model from another retailer and it worked fine - so I just got a dud! Amazon was quick in refunding my money, but what I really wanted was the battery. It is big in comparison to the NPFH70 model, but for the SR11, it really doesn't jut out as much as with other cameras due to the SR11's recessed battery compartment. I really could've used the extended power time IF IT HAD WORKED! : P"
4,Kind of Bulky but pretty cool,It only make $$$cents to purchase this on Amazon for the same amout of money it will cost to buy the NPH70 or 60 at a retail store for the same amout of money. You get more for your money with the NPH100 battery purchased from amazon.
2,Disappointed,"I bought this Sony battery as an additional one for my Sony camcorder. Unfortunately, it doesn't charge fully, and the new battery will only register 283 minutes on a full charge instead of 415 minutes like my other one. I even ordered another charger in case it was the problem. Nothing changed, still 283 minutes max. Looks like I bought a genuine Sony for naught!"
2,My fake one died at just over two years of age!,"It never did as many hours as it was advertised to do, but as long as it was lasting three or four hours I was happy. But last week it suddenly ran out of power after two hours, and today it was an hour and a half before my screen suddenly went blank.It was sold as a genuine Sony one (but for about $50)and it fooled me.It only weighs 120 grams, instead of the normal 190g, and the serial number is hot-stamped and imperfect, not like the very fine stamp on a real Sony battery."
5,Disproportinately long-lasting battery,The battery that comes with the Sony HD camcorders (or at least with my SR7) is the FH60. The FH100 is at least 4-5x longer lasting... So disproportinately good battery and so far so good - no complaints. Films for ever.
4,"Excellent Product, Not So Excellent Price","This battery is a life saver and really should be standard on a high end HD camcorder. We bought this so we could video our wedding and it even had power to spare at the end of the night. It is a little big, heavy, and can certainly get in the way if you are using the eyepiece (who does that anyways?). But, overall if you're looking to record more than an hour or so of material straight, your options are slim. At over $100 this isn't exactly a bargain, but it is a necessity."
3,"battery life is good, it is the extra cost for sony product","I bought it for a camcorder. The battery along with the camcorder is Sony 60H, it can only last 100 mins after charging. The 100H shows over 300 mins. To be honest, the first thing to consider for a sony camcorder is its battery, your hard disk wont be full after using several times of full charged battery. It means you have to always prepare for an extra battery. It's true, and you have to consider the extra investment for sony product, such as battery, charger, and so on. They are quite expensive.As for the quality of the battery, it is good.But it is a little longer than the sony 60H battery. There is an extra length after putting it in my sony sr 11 camcorder, which supports this type of battery, but it looks awkward for its extra longer part."
4,Big size but good battery life,"No doubt this battery is gives almost 4 - 6 hours of power backup. best part is ... Its MADE IN JAPAN (not China). the only thing I did not like about this battery is, its very big. It doesn't look so good on my Sony CX100.Overall, I am happy with my purchase."
4,Has a bad reputation,"I read all of the reviews and therefore was warned. I have been a user of the Nike Rio for many years and have loved the design and the bullet proof performance. The bad reputation of the PSA 250 has driven it out of most retail stores, and for good reason at the time. I bought one at the new low price. I'm not at all sorry. The DMM software that is included is junk, don't install. The Philips website has an upgrade for the firmware, download it right away. Music Match software is OK, but buggy. I've been using Windows Media Player to transfer songs, and MM to put them in playlists. It's easy once you the hang of it. It's a great device for runners, with enough memory for ever the slowest marathon!!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS.....,"If you are running windows XP at least. I loaded both forms of software onto my computer. The 'Nike' software crashed my computer everytime I turned it on. Once I managed to figure out how to uninstall that and got the computer running again, I decided to try the other program. Musicmatch. That program worked fine...until...you select the option to load files to portable. After that? You guessed it. Crashed everytime. So now I have a 200 dollar hockey puck."
1,Don't Do it!!!,"I was given this product as a gift and it has been a royal pain. I'm not computer illiterate in the least; however, I've spent HOURS trying to effectively download songs to this device. Its like trying to solve an unsolvable puzzle (even with the musicmatch software--which I used prior to acquiring this player).I've spent enough time on this miserable player so I won't spend anymore time on its review. Heed this warning! Buy anything else."
4,Mas Facil Quick Reference,The price on this item cannot possibly be correct. IMPOSSIBLE. $195.49 for a quick reference guide??????????
3,Not quite what I expected,The book description did not mention that the edges of the pages appeared stained with coffee. It wasn't in the 'very good' condition that I expected.
4,lots of smiles here?,great uptempo blues with a few dashes of low down to the heart blues w/help of the great bb king himself on two tracks. cd starts with a great tune called back on track to the bluesy rehabilitation song. if you like a rollercoaster ride of emotioins this cd is for you
3,Great product but make sure you realize that you are paying for ONE box,"I love this product and when we moved to another County for my husband's job - I knew I needed to buy it online. One thing that I failed to recognize that I paid $12.50 for ONE box. When I saw the word kitS, I thought it meant more than one. Once it arrived an I re-read the description - I realized that it was ONLY ONE box. Just be aware of this before you make your purchase."
3,"Great price, minor inconveniences","There is no indication of which side is the printing side. The sheets are totally blank and look seamless so it takes a bit of investigating to figure out how to load the labels. Putting the labels on the CD's can be a bit tricky too since they are super sticky and there is no margin for error. The static electricity makes them grab before you're ready. If you're not careful, you'll get them on crooked and there is no salvaging the label. It's also difficult to rescue the CD since it's very difficult to peel the label off once you've got it on crooked. If you can put up with these two minor inconveniences and you're not in a hurry to finish a large project, the price is certainly right."
4,covering the basics,"It is a great book to get the formulas down. With practice, you can definately fly the stars. Suggested remedies are sometimes not appropriate because other unforseen variables are not discussed. Deeper explanations of number combinations would make it that much better. In general though, It is good to get started with and opens the door to a very powerful system."
5,Pure brutality,"This CD is I think one of the best Mort CD's ever. If you're looking for really good thrash metal that is Christian or just a really good metal band, than this is the ultimate choice. I really loved this CD and I know you will. Pure brutality at its best. The ultimate thrash CD."
3,Better than I thought,"Earlier this year I wrote what was not a fair review of this album--I apologize for that. After subsequent listening, this disc has quite a few high points and should end up being in collections of those who love big band. I guess I must have been expecting different stuff from this bunch and experienced a let down upon my first couple listenings. An apology goes to Vinnie Colaiuta too for he is truly one of the best drummers playing today. I am used to hearing him in very different musical settings."
3,Needs more drive,"Although this CD was released in 2000, I was not aware if it until I heard a few cuts on SiriusXM Real Jazz. While generally enjoyable, only half the tracks have any semblance to Count Basie with his piano and rhythm section and the swinging, tight ensemble arrangements. The other tracks could have been called ""Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band and Beyond.....admittedly not quite the ring of ""Basie and Beyond"". It's more like a West Coast studio session than a major undertaking by Quincy Jones and Sammy Nestico. And while the musicians and soloists are first class, the whole tone is very uncool. The much earlier Woody Herman's Third Herd is much higher on the cool scale. Considering that this is a really big band, not just a big band or a little big band, I find the the overall impression too subdued. Basie would have demanded a lot more of a band this size. His band could really swing. I heard him in Brussels in the late 1970's and he blew the roof off the hall."
2,"Major, major disappointment","Though it's great to see Quincy Jones finally returning to his jazz roots after all these long, long years, I cannot help but wish that it had been with a more impressive offering. For the band on this album is a studio orchestra, which contains far too many smooth jazz alumni among the few died-in-the-wool jazz players. The result is a very bland, unexciting sounding band, in which many of the solos do not mesh well with the arrangements. There are also too many ballads, and a decided lack of powerful swing numbers. The most impressive piece to my mind was the perennial For Lena And Lennie, a lovely melody which was performed with great warmth here. But apart from this, an album which has VERY little to do with Basie, unfortunately, and one which singularly failed to engage me."
2,"Not dissapointed, but almost ...","After suspiring on an almost weekly basis for the past 5 years ""when will that new QJ studio CD see the light? ;-( "" I was so happy to learn that my dream finally became reality. ""Back on the Block"" was impressive, ""Jook Joint"" was a heaven, and I was expecting the 3rd one on the line. But B&B is just a superbly recorded and Pro Tool'd CD -that's all-. It didn't make me shiver as Jook Joint did. However this might be what Quincy and Sammy Wanted: A tribute to Count, and that they have done. Perhaps a little less hype on the booklet would have been more realistic. *** Quincy: Will I have to wait another 5 years for you to make me shiver again ?"
3,Black Sun Ensemble - 'Sky Pilot' (Camera Obscura),"'Sky Pilot' was the neo-psych band's fifth effort.Not quite what I was hoping for.A friend recommended this disc to me.Not saying it isn't any good,just wasn't my cup of tea.A couple of tracks that sort of held my interest were the 22-minute opener ""Sky Pilot Suite/Dove Of The Desert/Clear Yellow Days"" and ""Cherokee Mist"".Might appeal to fans of Flaming Lips,Holy River Family Band and maybe Meat Puppets or Julian Cope.See what you think."
3,better story than writer,"Like some other reviewers of this book, I bought it directly from the author at a local festival in North Carolina. I bought it because I found Kevin to be very engaging and I really wanted to support a local author. The book is a quick read, the story is compelling, but I kept getting distracted by the writing style. Spare as his story telling is, I think Kevin needs and deserves a really good editor. That said, I plan to purchase the sequel when it arrives because I do want to find out what Kevin's fictionalized version of himslf does next."
5,A deeply moving account of survival and renewal.,"Cropp artfully creates characters with great depth as protagonist and antagonist role-switch in early chapters. Woven throughout are intricate, insider descriptions of high school baseball's highs and lows. As the story proceeds to the end-game of life, ""The Time Keeper"" provides the reader with assurance there is ""...a time for every purpose under heaven.""Cheron J. Mayhall, Ph.D.author of ""The Bridge Is Love: A Journey Through Grief to Joy After the Death of a Child"""
5,Proved to be one of great inspiration.,"The Time Keeper was written for the soul to read. Through your intimate relationship with words you accompany your reader on a journey that from beginning to end reveals the honesty of human emotion in both its dimmest and brightest light. Your story spoke to me on a very personal level. Although our experiences differed in circumstance, we both remain among the survivors of love and life surrendered through death. Clearly, you have made your way through the years, all the while holding true to the promise you made to your mom during her final season."
4,Great Book,"The Time Keeper is an inspiring book to all. This book can help many people who struggle with this problem. I actually really liked this book and I do not like to read. This book was very sad, I even had tears in my eyes. the Time Keeper is definitely a book everyone should read.Kevin E. Cropp did an amazing job at creating this book. My copy of the book even came signed. I am really glad my teacher assigned this book because I really enjoyed it. I will always remember this story and admire you, it even got my eyes watery at some points. It was a sad book, but a good lesson to be learned."
5,A Must Read for High School Students,"Kevin Cropp's novel, The Time Keeper, is a must-read for high school students. Dealing with many relevant topics for high school students, such as family conflict, reconciliation/forgiveness, dying, loss, goal/setting, conflict with teachers and girlfriends, the story of Corey Wailes sets an example of persevering through tragedy. In addition to being well written, with symbolism, strongly developed characters, thought-provoking themes, and great framing, it is a story that brings much discussion and growth into the lives of young adults. As an Advanced Placement English teacher and a creative Writing teacher, I feel The Time Keeper should earn itself strong recognition for the values and examples it offers teenagers today."
5,All Care Givers Need To Read This,"This book is one every care giver should read for that is whom it largely addresses. As a former volunteeer with Hospice, the original Hospice, I think all care givers should be given this book. It deals with the negative side of dying and turns it into positives for both the care giver and the patient. I believe it can give insight that ""cures"" the disease which ravages a family that occurs when ""we"" don't deal healthily with dying. There are to be more books coming and I am anxious to see what Kevin does next."
5,What an emotional page turner!,"When I received The Time Keeper in the mail on a Saturday, I figured I would just thumb through a few pages. I ended up reading the whole book in one sitting. This is a wonderful and very emotional book - especially for those who have been affected by cancer in some way. I have read it twice now - and have cried my eyes out both times! It's a good reminder of what the important things are in life. I can't wait to read more books from this author!!"
5,An incredibly moving story,"By reading this book I was reminded of how beautiful, and fragile, relationships can be. As I reached the last page, I felt as if I had known and loved these characters all of my life. I am hoping for a sequel and am looking forward to reading future works by this talented author."
5,"a heartfelt story of love, family and pride","It is a hard review to write with so many great things I could say about the book, but The Time Keeper is a heartfelt story of love, family and pride that will leave you wanting more. The book sparked feelings about my own family. It was hard to put down, and kept me in tears. I recommend it."
4,TimeKeeper Entertains,"The Timekeeper is a wonderfully entertaining read. Exploring the highs and lows of a teens life, overcoming tremendous odds, makes this a truly inspirational story. I am now a Kevin Cropp fan and look forward to reading his next novel."
5,The Time Keeper,"The Time Keeper was an easy read, that captured me from the very beginning. I usually find it hard to finish a book if it does not grab my attention during the first few pages. I actually finished this book the second night after beginning it. The Time Keeper touches on points between parents and their children that I'm sure many people can relate to. Having a teenaged son myself, I could relate to the feelings that Mr. Cropp so vividly described. It was truly the first book I've ever read that made me cry, not only once, but several times.I would highly recommend this book, and I look forward to future books from this author.Kimberly B.Hope Mills, North Carolina"
3,OK,Tastes ok. Easy to mix. It's OK. I stopped using it because of the thickining agent used. Not sure that is good for the body.
1,That's not a book!,"Not a book, more of a brochure with lots of goofy pictures. I could not believe I paid $5 for it when I got it..."
1,A waste of time.,"Filled with new age pablum and Wiccan ways of creating runes. There isn't a bibliography, so parts of the book has been plagiarized. The meanings of the runes are completely wrong. At least it doesn't include the blank rune. Don't waste your money on this book."
2,Blegh,"I'm the first person to write an Amazon.com review for this book since 1999--I'll let you know that by the time I got my hands on this book, it was outdated. About 1/2 of the internet URLs given are broken. And that's a generoulsy low estimate.And as for the sites that do work--I was disappointed. I'm not prejudiced towards disgusting material. I gave the ""That's Disgusting!"" book 5 stars. That book was funny--this one is just tasteless.Since I loved the first ""That's Disgusting!"" book so much, I'd say that I was the ""intended audience"" for this--it didn't make me happy, so I'm guessing it won't make anybody happy.Save your money--and you'll save yourself a stomachache."
5,Great Value for a modern bar stool,"I ordered this product because I wanted a modern bar stool, but not the high prices I've seen them for. This was a great bar stool for the price. It metal wasn't too shiny and the wood was a great real-wood look. I think it's a great value for the money and would recommend this product."
1,The movie Tom Janes will want to forget he ever made.,This movie is totally out of control. Watch it at your own peril!!
1,Had to throw the kit out.,"I was excited to get this kit. I have done mosaic work before. I was impressed with the kit until it came time to grout it. I mixed the grout as per the directions & began to apply it. There wasn't enough to do even 1/3 of the trivet. As I couldn't get more grout quickly & couldn't wash it off, you can't put grout down a drain, I ended up throwing the whole kit away.If I could give this no stars I would."
1,never do super saver shipping,i used the super saving shippping in dec . it is jan 30 and i still have not recieved my shoes. very disappointed
4,wonderful way to spend an afternoon,"My husband and I have been touring the coast of California for a couple of years and I was sure we had missed a few beautiful spots, I saw this book in the waiting room of my dentist recently and had to have it. This book has given my husband and I many places to visit and enjoy. It is full of wonderful pictures and great discriptions of the coastal towns California has to offer. I would encourage everyone to get a copy of it. Even if you are not planning on visiting these areas it is a wonderful book for you coffee table your friends and family will enjoy it."
4,Little rat comes through,I think Little Rat does a pretty good job of representing the sequence of emotions kids go through when they try something new that's both exciting and scary. I got all 3 books for my daughter. I appreciate that a vilified animal is used to tell the story.
4,Loved this story,Shadowed Love was a great read. A very moving story. I'd like to read more books written by Martine Jardin.
4,Spellbinding and enlightening,"All too often, the US gets sole blame for racism. Martine Jardin centered Shadowed Love in a society where perhaps even worse injustices have been perpetrated against people of color. The tragedy and brutality of apartheid, as depicted by Jardin, makes every caring person realize that racism continues to be a worldwide problem that wreaks misery and, in the form of so-called ethnic cleansing, causes wars. The reader becomes so deeply involved in the suspenseful plot,that the book is impossible to put down."
4,Intense depiction of apartheid,"After following the characters through so many seemingly insurmountable difficultites, I hope to see a sequel, as I became well acquainted with them, and I want to see what happened after the happy ending."
5,Glad I found Chad.,"I bought this CD for the Bat McGrath tunes on it, being a long-time fan of his. I'm not sorry! I was extremely impressed from beginning to end. Hope this CD get the credit and recognition it deserves."
2,This is too Basic!,"There's basic and there's basic. This book is to basic, stamping the same stamp 3 times, and that's all that's on the front of the card. The project's aren't imaginative, most of them are designs like a child playing with inks.The other reviewer is correct good pictures, and good information on the basic tools needed, and there use. So I gave it 2 stars for these reasons. But there are other books that will give you this same information, and the projects are more rewarding and attractive. This book is for someone who probably doesn't have any or no background in paper crafting at all. Because most of this information is so basic it's mostly just common sense, if you already have a little background in crafting. But I think even if you are a beginner you would probably want better looking results. I'd pass on this one."
5,ONE OF THE BEST SVU BOOKS EVER EVER EVER WRITTEN!!!!!,This book was fanstastic - it was quite hard to believe that it was an SVU book! It was very realistic and moving. Jessica's trial made me cry so much! I am so glad that Maia spoke out and sent James down. More SVU books should be written like this!
5,great book,"augustine's confessions is an invaluable work. it couples heart-felt soul-searching with intelligent theological/philosophical analysis. after reading it, there is little wonder why many consider him the most influential christian thinker since paul."
2,I suppose if you are a Catholic you might like this book,"Much like the New Testament, this book caters to the faithful, but the curious will be left with a great ""what's the point?"" feeling.Augustine spawned the genre of confessional literature and as far as confessional literature goes, this is a pretty good book. Unfortunately he lost my attention towards the beginning when he whines about his grievous horrible sin in stealing the fruit from the tree. Couldn't he just apologize to the owner of the tree? Maybe buy the guy a new tree? Offer to work it off?The rest of the book is much like that. Augustine feels guilty, horribly guilty all the time. If you are a fan of the Catholic guilt complex, this is the book for you. If you don't think that the earth is horrible place to test you for Heaven, then try someone else."
2,overrated,This is easily the most overrated religious book ever. I believe it is Chapter 6 where Augustine talks about how he used to steal pears just to steal them even though he wasn't hungry is the best thought in the book about how natural evil is to us and how bad we really are.There I just told you the best part of the book. Chapters 10 and 11 are absolutely horrific. Can anyone really say they understood those chapters?Augustine has a major problem with sex in general and is a really bad advice giver on that subject.
4,Satisfying...,"In a nutshell, it delivers what the title promises...no more, no less and it does it well.."
5,More wisdom than in any small book I've ever read,"This book is so profound I can't describe it. I don't know how anyone could distill so much that was so important into such a small work. Love, death, parenting, drugs, nature, solitude, work. And everything is so wisely expressed. Give this book to every young person you know. No, give it to everyone you know! I defy you to read this and not be enlightened in some way you never imagined."
3,3.5 Stars for Boldness and Honesty,"I read this book because I kept seeing it other books I've read - everything from books about Prophecy to books about Spiritual Gifts, to books about Theology and even Evangelism.It comes highly recommended, yet it still took me a long time to really get into reading this book. It was practical, brief, and contained many examples from the author's life or lives of his colleagues, and serves as a good reminder of how far we've come in church history to accepting the manifestation of spiritual gifts.3.5 stars--not quite a 4, but definitely more then 3, for Boldness and Honesty."
4,Keep this to loan to non Pentecostals..,"Excellent read from someone who was not schooled in the Pentecostal or the Charismatic scene, but was a conservative evangelical. WHile lecturing at the Fuller Institute he reserched and realised that the mission/church growth was happening around the pentecostal churches - real church growth, not just gospel presentations. And he explains why - pagans, once converted simply expect Christ to be more powerful than their old gods. He also relates how, even missionaries who do not proclaim modern day healing see God's healing hand when new converts turn and even those not converted ask for Christ to heal as it is written in the bible. God called him back to pastor with a message - Preach the word as it says, not out of experience. A very balanced account, explaining how the Evangelicals and Pentecostals are moving closer, each adressing the others objections."
5,Worth finding--one of the best,"What I was looking for was a book I could use to teach a class on relationship evangelism. Furthermore, my ideal is a book that addresses post-modern people (especially Gen-Xers and Gen-Yers) with their common aversion to embracing any exclusive or absolute truth. How can you show, and not just tell, the good news?In my view, such a book needs to combine both scriptural foundations and practical models. If the book hits this target, the reader will gain a few memorable approaches and build lifelong habits.This book, unlike most on the subject, includes:1. Discussion or review questions at the end of each chapter2. Application exercise(s) at the end of each chapterNet: If you want more results, this book remains in my mind one of the best ever written. It is well worth the effort spent trying to find it."
5,Give it up for the Skins,this Book is a Must have for any Drummer period but especially for R&B Jams&Grooves. very insightful&you can feel the Music as you read the various details.this is the Kind of Book that should be the springboard for all Musicians in terms of Highlighten a particular Instrument. you feel the Joy&Passion within this Book.
5,Fast & reliable with personal touch - thank you! I love it!,"Thanks, Jason, for your note and hooking me up with this amazing encyclopedia of Funk Drummers! See you out there - connect with me via Facebook, Twitter, or visit NIKBeat.TV (enjoy the personal interview with David Garibaldi and my ""4-N Matter"" tribute drum solo to him & Tower of Power!). Lovin' it and peace out, Nikke Blout"
4,One Of The Best Books On Soul Drummers,"This is one of the best books I've read about R&B; (or rock) drummers and the crucial role they play in laying down the beat and driving the music.Someone said that reading about music is like dancing to a book (or something like that), but the author of this book has succeeded in gathering information and presenting it with great insight. Most of the book is in the drummers' own words from interviews he conducted with them. The author has the good sense and confidence to lay low and let the subjects speak for themselves. Their stories are fascinating and filled with inside-the-band facts that illuminate the music and how it was created.There are interviews with at least six of James Brown's drummers, and their stories overlap in a way that provides a multi-layered panorama of his music.If you are interested in the creative process -- in other words, how did they create those songs? -- you'll love this book."
5,This is the most important book I've ever read.,"In the field of self-help, this is the last book you ever need to read.This book contains the secret to life, and with step by step instructions, not with vague metaphors."
3,Lightweight but has problems,"We bought this case for my 6th grader to carry his alto sax to and from school. It is lightweight and makes it easy for him to carry. The problem is that it is not sturdy enough. The zipper and handles are on the back side of the case. This makes the bell of the sax an easy target. The instrument has already been banged up and we are not even sure how it happened. I can't afford to repair the sax every few months because the case is not sturdy enough. It is lightweight, but I wish that I had bought a more heavy duty case."
4,Great deal!,"Very elegant, formal shoe! Smooth leather upper and comfortable pointed-toe (doesn't pinch; my 8.5 M feels true to size). It has a cushioned insole and flexible midsole.Great for a professional attire at the office and very sexy at night too!"
2,Too skimpy,Doesn't look too bad in the photo. Scary when on. Was looking for one with side cutouts. This one the cutouts go pretty far around the front. More like a bikini with a T down the middle.
3,"Works as expected, but .....","Mahjongg Master Egyptian works as expected, but I find that I have never went back into this game after I installed it. The graphics just don't do it for me. I would have preferred bigger, clearer graphics on the tiles. Also, coloring that helps distinguish between the tiles more easily would have been nice - as well as a friendlier/cartoonish look rather than the small archaic aged look. It works as expected and it may very well appeal to many of you, but I will be uninstalling mine and giving it to the Goodwill."
5,It works for me!,"There's not a lot to say. My criteria is: Inexpensive, wood, natural clear coat finish, NO Particle Board with paper laminate.It arrived rather quickly -- three days. There is no assembly. However, it's lightweight and felt as if it was going to tip over due to my rough, crude, uneven wood flooring. I pressed down a little harder to secure the feet, loaded the shelves, and to my amazement, it's quite sturdy; I set a glass lamp on top.It looks nice against the brick wall, too. So, I've decided to get another and some bookshelves from the same series."
2,Not for DVDs,"I purchased this storage unit because it was advertised as a multmedia storage unit. My plan for the storage unit was to consolidate my DVDs in one location (currently they are on two different multimedia storage units). If all you have are single DVD jewel cases then maybe this storage unit will work fine for you. My problem is that I have several DVD collections (Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Star Wars, James Bond - 007, etc)that are in their own little collectable boxes that are just a bit taller than the single DVD jewel cases and do not fit on any shelf except on the very top. They are just about an 1/8 or a 1/4 inch too tall to fit in the middle or bottom shelves.It is a beautiful storage rack and went together very easily but either by design or accident they made the middle and bottom shelves too short."
5,"If I can put this together, anybody can....","Although it required absolutely no assembly - just unfold and you're good to go. Stacking two is also very simple and requires no screws or tools yet is acceptably secure.The only drawback is that the shelves are 8"" high so they only fit standard size DVDs, unless you place the oversized cases on the top shelf, or stack two units which provides extra height on the shelf where they are joined.I got the walnut finish and am very pleased with the appearance. Looks like real furniture!P.S. Although my receipt stated that the delivery date would be over two weeks from the order date, I received them in 3 days."
5,"Seedy premise, charming score","As someone who recently played Paul Bland in a production of this musical, I must say my opinion may be a little biased. But honestly, the music in here is great fun to listen to. From the opening to the end, you see Mary and Paul Bland take such a journey in their characters. From ""A Thought Occurs"" to ""One Last Bop"", the music styles range from tango to techno. And the stars are wonderful. You might recognize Eddie Korbich as Mr. Snow in the revival of Carousel and Adrian Zmed as Adam/Noah in Children of Eden. The vocals are stellar and the music is charming. I beg you to give this musical a chance, you won't regret it."
1,Ridiculous price...,"This price is way too high for an EP. I concede it may be a rare copy, but it isn't realistic to expect someone to purchase it, even a true fan such as myself. I would buy it if it were $40 cheaper."
1,AVIOD AT ALL COSTS,NOTHING on the big front of the box or any of the characters or movies are in the collection. This is the same old tired CR*P that Mill Creek and their ilk have been cranking out for years. They REALLY (I am serious) should be sued for false representation.I must have been on drugs when I made this buy. I should have know better.I hope the plastic burns well. I thought I'd use it for a fireplace starter this winter!
4,A lot of great info in a user-unfriendly format,"A lifestyle book arranged into short chapters such as Get Bikini Fit, Enhance Your Eyes, Party Preening, etc. COvers makeup, hair, food, fitness, spa & emotional health. Doesn't mention any specific ""looks"" just basic how-to advice & tips. Small b/w photos but not to be considered useful to the topic discussed. The book is packed with tons of tips so I'd be surprised if anyone didn't find at least one new helpful hint that would suit their lives. No specific product recs.One thing I didn't like was that the book wasn't set up in a easy-to-navigate format. Every chapter is 3-4 pgs long & not organized by section (eg: Makeup, Fitness, etc). This is probably why, even though I've owned the book for awhile, I've never read the entire thing. But this may not bother others."
2,It was just ok,"saw the book at a friends house, glanced through it. bought it - didn't know what to expect, but i didn't find it. Anyway, what was there was just ok."
5,Money Well Spent,"I first read the local Library's copy and practiced the drills on my treadmill. A week later my long run went way better than I expected. I came home and ordered my own copy along with the Evolution Running DVD. I have been practicing with the book/DVD combo for 3 weeks now and am happy with my purchase.2-16-2012 UPDATE: This has been the best bang for the buck of any running book I have read. I keep coming back to this one every couple of months. I wish I had the bucks to take a one on one class with this guy Mierke, he really knows his stuff."
5,The best book on water I've read,"This is a terrific book-passionate, informed, wide-ranging, and filled with lots of quotes and anecdotes. And it's very personal-Ms. Ward isn't writing from an armchair-she's been to all the places she writes about, and it shows. She's got a great sense of drama and eye for detail-you're right there with her in the helicopter when she flies low over a network of rivers. And because she knows the subject so well, Ms. Ward places all the twists and turns in her fascinating story in a broad, historical context. I'll never look at a glass of water in quite the same way again."
1,May not be what you think it is,Be careful that you don't think this is a compilation of songs by the original artists! The songs are by the New Millenium Orchestra.
5,"WITH GEORGE ""HARMONICA"" SMITH","Excellent cd a long player, some of Muddy's best live stuff I have heard. George ""Harmonica"" Smith is fantastic he is one of the harmonica greats. Also on this cd Muddy sounds excellent his voice is second to none, his guitar playing on this especially his slide is great. This is classic Muddy live he has been one of my favorites for years."
5,A Brilliant Historical Perspective,"This is not a blow-by-blow account of the Gulf War; indeed, the only actual description of the progress of the war itself is the Appendix, a transcript of General Schwarztkopf's 2/27/91 press briefing.The bulk of Summers' book is a critical analysis of the historical factors that in large part determined how the war was prosecuted and that determined its outcome. Much of this is a re-examination of why we failed in Vietnam- a subject covered brilliantly in Summers' earlier ""On Strategy:""- and the changes in US Military policy that followed. Particular import is placed on how the support of the American people and world leaders was cultivated to support the Gulf War.For students of history, politics and the military, this is a must read."
5,"PURE ""NOSTALGIA""","I rate it five stars, because of what it meant to me to ""discover"" these videos of the group's first two releases, which I had never seen here in my country. An eternal 'Til Tuesday and Aimee Mann fan, I own all of their cd's and even vinyls, at last I could watch the video versions for these unforgettable tracks from my college days, a treat!! Pure Nostalgia for times gone-by, even though now they seem pretty out-dated by today's standards and fashion, but it's the same thing with almost every video from the '80s, so not big deal!"
5,Priceless for any 'Til Tuesday fan,"There are only five tracks here, and one of them is the overplayed video for ""Voices Carry,"" but this remains an essential video record of one of the great pop bands of the '80s. The best thing about it is the final song, ""Just Like Me,"" which not only gives us a song not found on any of the band's three LPs, but a look at a live performance, too. It's too short a tape, but that doesn't make it any less essential!Tracks: ""What About Love"" (from *Welcome Home*), ""Voices Carry,"" ""Looking Over My Shoulder,"" ""Love in a Vacuum"" (all from *Voices Carry*), and ""Just Like Me."""
4,Matt's Version,"First of all this is not an RPG its, a Submarine Simulation (and a bad one at it) This game if for serious Gamers only, if you are not into playing for hours on end looking at a cheaply made sonar screen just to come to along story plot(again)just to be put back onto the sonar scren again out to look for an X - this is not the game for you. This game can be fun if your into this kind of stuff and the way the gamelets you get into depht is nice but Sacnoth (brand Name) could have did a MUCH better job in making this. So if this already dosnt sound like your type of game may i reccomend Beast Busters: Dark Arms!"
5,no more wet arm rests,"great product keeps rain out well im smoking also lets less wind in vehicle , i wish that they made in channel vent visors for my caddy. o well though, work great and they were reasonably priced"
5,A philosopher's take on the emergence of Queer Rights,"This book was written by a philosopher, not a lawyer or an activist, and has an entirely different approach to the issues he discussses. The writing is lucid, the reasoning is meticulous and the book provides a fascinating perspective on the role of Queer rights in American Society. Well worth reading."
3,recipe change,"The nibs were the best now with the new owners not the same . I was disapointed in the flavor and use of too many chemicals, now I go and search at health food stores."
3,One Little Disagreement With Ms. Sher,"This is a thought-provoking book geared especially towards Boomers looking to improve the path they're on or recreate themselves for the next part of the journey.One little problem though. Ms. Sher recommends ""forgetting"" about beauty. Er, if at any time, this is the time of your life when you should pay attention to your looks. I'm not advocating extensive plastic surgery or spending hours staring at ones reflection; nor am I saying attempt to appear to be 25 again. When you read of women in their 50's and 60's developing eating disorders, that's frightening! But to live a rich, full life you need to look after yourself and make the best appearance you can in order to move about comfortably in the world. Ms. Sher may say toss out the lipstick; I say head to Sephora for a makover.Other than that, Ms. Sher's books and viewpoints are worth the investment of your time and effort. Lots of food for thought and action steps outlined."
5,You have to read this book!,"This is a great book. It is simply written, but contains powerful, life-changing ideas. I am buying a bunch of copies and sending it to all my best friends and relatives that are over 40."
5,"So honest, so meaningful","This book deals so directly and honestly with the issues of changing your life. I can't get over how the author has thought through the desire for change and the challenges of actually making the changes. This book is more meaningful and pertinent than all the coaching books I ever bought before. It was more targeted at mid-life changes than I expected but it has relevant material for people of any age who want to change any aspect of their life in a significant way. Be prepared to be get shaken up as you read and to be real honest with yourself. At age 50 and considering a major change in my work, it was the perfect book for me."
5,inspiring reading,"It's an easy read. Everyone should be able to get something of value from the book. The author covers a lot of ground, comparing the first forty years of our life with the possibilities that can come later. She shows how, by examples and gives useful advice."
1,"Boring, trite, rewarmed, phoney","This book was just stupid. It's chock full of Pollyanna patter, feel-good-isms that don't say anything significant, and empty promises based on phoney-sounding anecdotes. I used to think Sher was a good writer, who put forth an interesting program -- but that was before I started reading the works of better authors. Sher's books are just plain silly -- but if you're interested in just reading a lot of fake ""you can do it"" verbiage, they might be for you."
3,It's Only Too Late If You Don't Start Now,Material is very good. The book had another persons writing inside with a phone number and names.
3,a basic trike - but not really for girls,"I was pretty disappointed in the color. The picture shows a cute blue and what I received was a very dark, boy-ish blue. Also the stickers they applied were sloppy, crooked and crinkled. We had to scrub them off which was too bad because they were the only girly thing about the trike besides the basket."
4,"""Yes"" sleeve artist's first publication.","The architypal album cover artist of the early seventies period, Roger Dean produced covers for seventies album artists such as Yes, Gentle Giant, Greenslade and even Osibisa. This, his first of a number of publications, contains his early and best work.For fans of the progressive rock group ""Yes"" it also contains a number of photographs from their ambitious ""Tales from Topographic Oceans "" tour.This book should be reprinted NOW and is a must for all ardent ""Yes "" fans."
5,The dean of album art,"Roger Dean is best known for his groundbreaking work in LP cover art, including Yes, Uriah Heep, Osibisa, and other names from the 1970s music world. This great collection pulls together Dean's early work, including sketches, student work from his time at the Royal College of Art, and set design for the Yes tour stages.I usually think of Dean as a visual artist, so his furniture, sets, and architectural interests were a pleasant surprise. It would have been helpful to have better identification of year in which each piece done. That's a small enough complaint, though. This is an outstanding collection of his work, and an interesting reference point for comparing the 70s culture to todya's.//wiredweird"
2,Not a musical but a recorded sermon!,"Awful. I just didn't have the heart to give it one star. Only for those who are religious/churchgoers. Oh and the music listing is wrong, there are actually about 14 numbers in the show not just 2."
4,Prenatal dha,"I have been pleased with this supplement during my pregnancy. I do not eat any fish so I realize I am not getting any DHA naturally. If I was up for fermented cod liver oil I might go that route but I don't have to worry about a stomach revolt with these pills. Both sets of bottles I got had a fishy odor which my previous Nordic naturals fish oils did not, however, I placed them in the freezer and don't have to worry about fishy smells or burps. I will be ordering more for this pregnancy and then switch once I deliver."
3,Fish burps.,"I bought this one instead of my usual brand (Rainbow Light) because it was cheaper, but after I received it I realized it wasn't cheaper because you have to take two pills instead of one. My fault for shopping while tired. After a few days, I started getting nasty fish burps from these pills. I started taking one in the morning and the other at night to see if it helps, and it definitely does, but I still occasionally get them after the 2nd pill. After I finally finish this bottle, I'm going back to Rainbow Light because that one doesn't give me the fish burps."
5,Great Product!,"I try to eat as organic as possible, and even though these Prenatal DHAs are not organic, I've research them and feel that they are the healthiest alternative. I haven't had any bad side effects. Will buy them again."
4,"Good, but other Nordic Natural Omega 3 products are BETTER","I like this product a lot. It's tasteless, odorless, easy to swallow, and gives you 450mg of DHA and 400 IU of Vitamin D in two pills. Perfect for the first trimester in many ways.BUT it turns out other Nordic Naturals products actually offer more omega-3s for just a bit more money--and I think it's worth it. There's the Ultimate Omega-D3, which give you 450mg DHA, 650 mg EPA, some other omega-3s, and also 1000 IU of Vitamin D3 in two pills. The prenatal pills cost 27 cents per pill, while the Ultimate Omega D3 is 37 cents per pill. (OK, the Ultimate pills are definitely bigger, but they go down surprisingly easily.)"
5,Love these!,This is the 3rd brand of prenatal dha that I have tried and this is the only one that didn't give me the fish taste burps! I did a lot of research on dha and this brand was highly reccommended. They are also easy on my stomach and I am 3 months pregnant!
2,Smelly....,"This is the second bottle of Prenatal DHA vitamins that I have purchased. The first one was great and there were no problems. The second one had a problem with the seal on the inside (it was already half taken off when I opened the bottle) and so when I smelled it, it reeked of bad fish smell. There is no way I could have taken them. So watch out--you may get a good bottle and you may not! When it is fresh, I think this is a good product and I had no problems with a fishy aftertaste."
2,NASTY!!!!!!!!,"These supplements give me the worst fish burps and they last for hours!!!!! I don't know how others do not get an aftertaste unless they take them right before they go to bed.On the plus side, they have 450mg of DHA which I haven't seen in any other prenatal DHA supplement. But the after taste is so bad that I sometimes skip taking them."
1,RANCID!! Returning item,"These pills smell to high heaven. When I opened the bottle, I was almost knocked out by the awful smell. It smelled like old rotten fish=rancid, oxygen exposed. I'm immediately returning this item and from now on will order any DHA from local drugstore and not online."
3,"Good Vitamin, Bad Fish Burps","The vitamin has everything a pregnant woman needs in a DHA supplement, but for me, the fish burps were unbearable. After 2 weeks, I had to switch to a different brand."
2,Warning-No Folic Acid!,"I am returning mine because there is no folic acid in these which is important for neural tube development and preventing spina bifida. Also, I did not notice these are to be taken twice daily, so they aren't as good of a deal as I thought. Just thought others would like to know this info too."
5,Good product,"No fish smell, no nausea due to these. The DHA amount in these are higher than the previous brand I used. The other brand had a high dosage of Omega 3 as well but most of it was EPA, not DHA."
2,This product stinks! (literally),"I decided to try this product because it has a higher DHA & EPA than the other prenatal vitamin I was taking. My doctor said that Omega 3's are the most important since we get so many of the other Omegas in our daily diets. This vitamin seemed like a good choice! Although, I did read some of the other reviews before purchasing and there were others that complained about the same issue.These fish oils reek! I have been taking fish oils for years and have tried many different brands, but these absolutely stink!To my knowledge fish oil supplements should not smell. You think that such an expensive brand as Nordic Naturals would have addressed this problem by now, especially since there have been other complaints!Would NOT recommend!"
2,not what I had hoped,"While some of the clip art is of good quality, it is difficult to find what I want within in. It is very limited."
4,McMillion hits the jackpot,"I've been listening to Dan McMillion and his jazz orchestra for over ten years now, and tihs recording (along with Up Your Brass) is at the top of my McMillion list. The arrangements (many being old Maynard Ferguson charts) are played wonderfully by this particular band. They are tight and focused. The solos, especially the reed players, are imaginative. The recording itself is very well done. It is too bad that this particular CD release is a little hard to find sometimes."
5,"electrifying, mesmerizing charismatic.","She is the most dynamic, exciting and versatile singer i've heard in a longtime. As a talent agent I would love to represent her. I believe she is the next big diva."
2,"Fun at first, but too much drift!","I originally bought this controller because of its ""turbo"" feature, and I loved it at first. However, it didn't take much time at all (only a month or so) before it started having some major drift problems - and that's with some pretty light use.I've shelved this controller, and now I just use my Wavebird."
1,Horrible controllers!!,These controllers are made out of very cheap plastic and the back cover to the battery compartment is always falling off. They never hold the charge and my kids can't stand using them. I will never purchase these controllers again. It was a HUGE waste of money.
4,Mind numbingly slow.,"Much like the other reviewers, I looked forward to this game. I did not have my hopes set so high but was hoping for a good road trip game. What I found was a slow plodding game that is insanely tepid.The 'story' part takes forever to get through. I think some dialog is lost in translation, which is totally forgivable, but most of it is just a poorly structured linear story. The game play itself is very very slow and at times overly difficult. The best thing I found out in the game was not to do the story missions for awhile and stick with just getting money and experience for your sub. Customizing the sub is neat but the menus and part names are poorly organized.This is a good idea with just some bad graphics and worse delivery."
2,Ordered DVD received VHS tape,"I ordered a DVD tape and received a VHS tape. This makes it difficult to utilize for the class I am facilitating. It frustrated me so much I have not researched how to return it and have this error corrected. It would be great to get the DVD first and then I will return the VHS.Can you help me?Thank you,Magtcc"
5,Pre-School Fun and Games,"Another great Hans Mayer CD! Hans addresses the curious world of the pre-schooler in these short bursts of musical fun. Each song invites big and little listeners to join his celebration of music, learning, and life. Numbers, the alphabet, sharing and manners, and household chores are featured here. Hans' music invites you to sing, dance, snap, and clap along. This CD is great for interactive playing, reinforcing early language skills, and using up pre-school energy. It's a gift to kids and parents alike!"
4,A good read,"Smith makes a good attempt at picturing aliens. His aliens are different enough from anything found on earth to be believeable.The alien society is a bit too much like human society. But it`s a better effort than most make in doing this sort of novel.And since there are no human characters in the story, the human reader needs to be able to identify in some way to make it a goodnovel. If he made their culture too alien it would be more of an academic speculation than a novel.Overall it`s a good book that you will enjoy reading."
1,Shocking theory has little substance,"""~THE HIRAM KEY is a regurgitation of old ideas from the 19th and 20th""~""~ imitated fictions about Jesus in all of literature. He""~ career is patently Egyptian. Sigmund Freud himself wrote a book on""~ God, as Knight and Lomas say in chapter six. Just because"
2,The Real Hiram Key,"I would like to comment that the Masonic rituals which they illegally reveal are only that; descriptions of scenes in a play which are enacted throughout the various degrees.The authors like so many of my fellow Masons seem to miss the whole point of secrecy and ""The Craft"" and that is that the true secrets of masonry cannot be communicated either verbally or in writing.So with respect to the book ""The Goose Has Really Been Chased""Apart from that it was a pretty good yarn."
3,Missing ideas,"The main problem with this and all such ""secret society"" and ""Jesus? Rules"" books is that they are all based on data from a paranoid patriarchal society. They all ignore the presence of the earlier monotheism: the mother goddess. How about delving into that earlier perception and finding out how close Jesus was to Adonis?"
2,A let down,"I was pretty let down by this book. There was very little supporting evidence as to their claims. I got the feeling the authors really love being masons but would like it to be more than it is. They seemed intent on connecting it to all of history and world leadership. About half way through the book I felt like I was watching one of James Burke's ""Connections"". Where we start out with invention of gin and tonic and end up with the destruction of the Allied firebombing of Hamburg in World War II. You can connect the girl scouts back to the pharaohs if you use this method.What is so bad about it simply being a relatively new service organization whose members do good works; where happy, cherubic men ride in itty-bitty cars for parades?"
2,"Exciting, but full of poor research & inconclusive proof","Though the authors frequently seem to reveal quite remarkable pieces of evidence, there's little if anything in this book not present in other books. Furthermore, many of the author's 'conclusions' are derived from pure speculation, with many dramatic sentences on the lines of ""what other than (insert mystery) could explain this (insert circumstantial and often irrelevant 'evidence')."" I do believe that in many ways, the authors have stumbled upon some elements of the truth, but they have no ability whatsoever to prove their points in a scholarly fashion. Had the authors made the effort to support their often radical claims, this undoubtedly fun read would also be a worthwhile historical text. As it stands, it's fun drivel with the occasional flash of brilliance."
2,Not Recommended,"I charitably gave the book two points -- one for the amount of research done and the second for the proofreading skills of the editor. Otherwise, it was a waste of time."
2,"Some good, some bad, but mostly bad.","The authors, being freemasons are quite proud of their alleged societal heritage. Imagine then to my surprise when the Templars were raised up to this lofty perch of ""true"" religious beliefs, and the catholic church, St. Paul, and others are brutally thrown under the bus. Mind, I expected it, but I just didn't think that these two authors could have that much of a sense of inflated ego. I was wrong.I swear to God, will someone who writes on the Templars please take the time and read Malcom Barber's books, and perhaps 1 or 2 others that are really experts. I think you'll find when you review Barber's work that the Templars were not this occult driven organization that these revisionists would place them in.Still, this book was better researched than others in the genre, but still lacked any level of scholarly acceptance. I shant bother with the silly prequel"
4,Extremely Thought Provoking,"At one point I thought I was reading fiction or something, at which time I began to ""run out"" the references and check with distinguished and learned collegues. This book is factually based and the logic is sound. I highly recommend this work."
2,Not too academic,"I approached this book with great enthusiasm that fizzled out slowly as I read the book. I'm an attorney and I prefer to have hard facts, and I will even take well founded circumstantial evidence if need be. These authors base all their conclusions on neither. I was frankly shocked that they would actually say that they had proven ""such and such"" to be fact based on their own self-serving speculations. This book is fun to read, but it will certainly not shake Christianity to its roots as it claims it will do. I don't mind the conclusions at all, but they are ridiculous when a person with objective common-sense views the same ""so-called"" evidence that the authors put forth to base those conclusions on. In short, nice effort by the authors, but the authors conclusions will never be respected by true academics who study, research, and write on the same general subject matter."
4,Good Read,"This book is an interesting read. It should not, however, be viewed as an actual truth. The authors were just a little to eager and may have come to the conclusions they wanted to. They also are decidedly anti-Catholic and even suggest that Protestantism may be based on false information. Who is to say that their research it the actual truth? They site that Old and New Testament writings cannot be relied on, because the authors injected their own beliefs and may have left out truths. Who is to say that this is not the case with some of the writings that the authors of ""The Hiram Key"" site as the actual truth abouth Biblical characters. They many times refer to Paul (Saul) as ""The Spouter of Lies,"" and claim his Gospel is fabricated.The book ""The Hiram Key"" is interesting, though, and may shed light on the actual beginnings of some Masonic ceremonies, though."
2,another fussy form of spirituality,"It was fun reading this book and questioning the authenticity and veracity of the facts presented. It is definitively not a book for religious zealots. Too bad the authors did not mention the female branch of the Free Masonry, the Eastern Star, and how it relates to their ""discoveries"". For me as an ex-catholic, ex-protestant, ex-buddhist, ex-eastern star initiate, and so on.... it is just another male-made, fussy, tortuous, absurd, aberrant form of spirituality; why to complicate your path to God to that extent?: there is God and there is you, all in between is rubbish and lies."
4,Secret Name of God vs. Curse of the Mummy,"There is lots of food for thought in this book especially if you have always wondered about the truth of Christianity or any other organized religion for that matter. Where this book fails is in the search for the subject, Hiram Abif. The detective work leaves a lot to be desired. These two Master Builders, build on mistake after mistake. Their gravest mistake is actually ignorance or being unenlightened. Its obvious that they think that from reading the text they know the secret name of God revealed to Moses. That name is only for sincere seekers of truth and is not written anywhere, even in the Holy Bible. In a Curse of the Mummy sort of way, I still give Hiram a 4 for entertainment. Yuk Yuk!"
1,Terrible!,"I was aghast that the authors, Knight and Lomas, would embarrass themselves and write such idiocracy. Their conclusions on the secret rites in Freemasonry was all based on assumptions, not historical fact. They twisted scripture and historical dates to fit their insane theories, and as they did so made the Jewish race out to be the big bad enemy and the Egyptians out to be the great heroes. The book shows just how racist the authors are against the Jews, which only makes me think that the entire Freemason's order (based on Egyptian rituals) probably are racist too."
2,Jumping to conclusion,I think that the sources that the authors use are open to more then one interpretation. The authors not being historians leaves the accuracy of their research in question. I feel that their being freemasons they come to this research with some biases and finding answers that are not really their.
2,"Interesting read, but the authors are missing the point&#65533;","I have do give credit to the authors for their obvious hard work and dedication. The problem with this book is that the authors don't seem capable of rising above dealing with such a complex phenomenon as Christianity with intellects only. They are not inferior, but are blind and even misleading in these sublime areas as faith and God. The book does not portray the Freemasonry in a very attractive light either, judging by the ideas and views of the authors. ""Stigmata"" as a movie version of this book is not very bright either, but probably is a better entertainment. I'd recommend to read much more subtle and intelligent ""Answer to Job"" by Carl Jung instead, if you are seeking fresh ideas in this area."
4,Creative speculation that merits consideration,"While authors Knight and Lomas can get dangerously speculative at times, their conclusions are plausable.The Hiram Key persents many theories to complete it's 'presented' history; and while it's unlikely that all of their speculation is true many of the statements undoubtably are correct.The prinicpal value of the Hiram Key would be to as a starting point for further academic research in an environment that lends itself to such study (ie, a University). To the casual reader it might spark an interest in other works on related topics.Unfortunatly, due to it's speculative nature and controversial subject matter, this book will come under fire (with whatever ammunition) is available ) by those who find the topic offensive or dangerous. But, despite it's speculative nature I would reccommend the material to anyone willing to further thier understanding of either Free Masonry or the modern Christian church."
5,The Truth is right here!,"I have read so many books on this subject and I have to say that the Hiram Key is in my humble opinion the BEST! The authors have gone to such lengths to back up their conclusions by painstakingly researching history. I read this book with such a smile on my face because many of the other books that I have read contain fragments of the truth, but these guys have pulled it all together into a concise, clear and easy to understand presentation. I am not a mason (yet) but this book should be required reading for all masons to continue their membership in the craft. If you haven't purchased this book yet, BUY IT! If you have read it, read it again - I know I am!"
2,Entertaining but poor history,"This book is defenitely an entertaining rendition of the authors interesting investigation into freemasonry. The problem is that the story is perfect,way to perfect for anyone to really believe. At every point they are faced with a mystery that has baffled scholars for years and every time a solution magically appears. Never once in their investigation do the authors find something they can't solve. By the end of the book the have not only discovered how Freemasonry began but also know the true identity of Hiram Abiff and the origin of the Turin Shroud!! All this without a single note referring to some source!! The book doesn't even have a bibliography. A little lacking in evidence to make such astounding discoveries don't you think. In the authors' defense their speculation is at least plausible if lacking in evidence and the book is a highly entertaining read with interesting little bits of information. But be wary, the evidence is sketchy at best."
2,Chariots of the Gods II (or has that already been done?),"This is one of the few books that I'v read recently that automatically made me feel intellectually superior.A detective story that makes it up as it goes along, and doesn't worry if the pieces don't fit.Like an Italian race car, it has no rearview mirror because, ""If it's behind you, it doesn't matter!""."
4,Research Should Never Stop...,"These authors provide an interesting perspective on conventional ideas most western hemisphere citizens have been taught were ""truth."" To me just what any so called ""devout"" Christian needs! What is someone's faith worth if no one ever attempts to challenge it? Nothing. Worth reading whether you consider them ""dumb"" or not..."
3,"VERY Interesting, but no references!","I don't know if I'm completely convinced by what they have concluded, but they certainly give a person a good amount of food for thought! I was a bit dissapointed that there were no clear references to their facts. Granted, some of the theories are based on speculation, but it would have been nice to have had some clear references (like cites and a full bibliography) to go with the facts that they've lain down. They did do a very good job of turning commonly accepted ideas on their heads!"
3,Quantum leaps,"This is just another attempt to link Freemasonry with the social systems of the ancient past. It's an interesting read, but be ready to take some quantum leaps across the chasms of time. What the authors lack in the way of hard evidence they certainly make up in imagination..."
2,where's the bibliography?,"These authors live in a fairy tale. They provide no support for the evidence they claim to have, and what they call ""concrete proof"" is only a collection of wild guesses."
5,Very Interesting Read,"Some of the other reviewers describe the historical series of events which Knight and Lomas outline as being too perfect. I think all the facts support their hypothesis.Either way The Hiram Key is extremely interesting while being entertaining at the same time, regardless of your beliefs. There are so many small tidbits of useful information such as the origin of the cross symbol and the fish symbol, and the suggested meanings of curious phrases such as ""let the dead bury the dead"" and ""the meek shall inherit the earth"".I just can't wait until they excavate Rosslyn. Hope it's in my lifetime. ;)"
1,Wrong readers,"Critics complaining that this book is a compilation of highly improbable, complicated theories without any proof or references do not belong to the intended audience of such books.The real audience for this book, gullible autodidacts, doesn't care about proofs."
1,Hiram Key: The discovery of a poorly written book,"Fortunately I didn't buy this book, I happened by it in my local library. I've been interested in connections between Masons, and the original church for some time. The first thing I thought was how could I have missed this book. The answer was; I missed it because this book is ridiculous. The book starts out well enough, very concise very informative. Then it takes a turn in an unexpected way. The authors present evidences that are twisted and strangely interpreted, and then suppose conclusions from those twisted evevidences that are sometimes so strange, I wonder if the authors didn't have the conclusion to there research before they actually did any of it. I found this book biased, lacking factually, sometimes deliberately deceiving (e.g. The authors claim the Hebrew word for ""son of"" is ""bar"" as in barabbas the word is ""bene"" pronounced ""ben nay""). The only reason for this deception is to add validity to the bazaar conclusions that are drawn."
1,buyer beware,this book is a farse. the authors claim to do all this great research and yet have no training or education in either. there results call into question the very faith that the brotherhood was founded on and stands for. the real kicker is that there is no basis for any of this. an equal explination could be made to come up with a completely different result. i am sorry i actually spent money on this book.
1,Faulty Research and Extreme misconceptions,"As a freemason and one who has been active in academic research, I must say that I would not recommend this book. It was very intriguing and entertaining as a book of fictions; however, the conclusions drawn are clearly not factly. If you choose to read this book take it with a grain of salt."
1,You Hiram? And I fire 'em!,"If Arnold Toynbee and Barbara Tuchman were to down tools and turn their attention to designing the bus arbitrator for the next generation of Intel chips, they would certainly be more successful than this advertising exec and electrical engineer doing historical research. Although I agree with many of the general beliefs of the authors (e.g. Paul hijacking the Christian religion), I kept thinking how this book demonstrates the value of peer review.And what an anti-climax! At the end they tell us that they KNOW that all those documents are buried beneath the Roslyn chapel and that they have permission to excavate, but what did they find? I find it a little suspicious that we haven't heard about the ""Scotland Scrolls"" yet."
1,If the editors had checked and cross checked the sourcing...,this book would have never been published. Anyone with a fifth grade education and an hour to spend in a good library can blow these authors out of the water. Don't waste your money here...order a reputable book instead from our friends here at amazon.
1,Amazing Trash,"This book serves only one major purpose - it elevates Erich von Daniken and the Roswell writers to the status of serious scholars. It is the most unconscionable collection of sophistry, conjecture, and historical inaccuracy that I have read in years. There are highly controversial and questionable quotations without citation, references to books with even less scholarly authority than this one, and completely inaccurate historical claims with no documentation to justify them. The authors' debunking of basic Christian beliefs follows the same contorted logic as that of the Jesus Seminar. The only reason I give it one star is that there is no lower rating. (edited)"
3,The Hiram Key,"For those interested in Masonic research, this is a ""must read"". Not so much for accuracy of conclusions , but for the ideas and facts presented. Unfortunatly Knight and Lomas appear to reach too many preconceived conclusions and really stretch facts to get there. Having said that, it contains much interesting detail, and it certainly presents different ways of looking at related masonic history."
3,"Engaging, but Terrible Scholarship!","A great read, it must be confessed, but truly terrible scholarship. The authors ask readers to assume a lot and make great leaps of conjecture and supposition with flimsy, non-existent, manipulated, highly selective or exagerated ""evidence"".By far, this is one of the worst books about Freemasonry to be found among friendly authors, due to their abuse of the rules of evidence and proofs."
1,This Book is Almost Fiction,"I read this book about 2 years ago when I boughtit. I am a mason also but i did not enjoy the reading. It was somewhat fictional in a way, from the way it was presented I believe but thats my opinion."
2,"misunderstood, mistaken, lost, searching, no light found","This book, although a great read, and a mind opener to say the least is totally, drowned in athiesm, to say that Jesus had a twin brother named Thomas is not only a comment from lack of study, but also a joke, Thomas who was also represented in the Bible, and many other Holy texts was no more than a prophet, if that. The study of Freemasonry is what I was searching for when I purchased this title seeing as I am a Mason myself, and I believe that I can say that is what most people who purchased it were looking for also. For the athiest, beauty at it's best!! I have studied many religions, and as most religious scholars will say, beauty, and ease to believe is most important to people these days. If you can read this and underdstand that most of it is circumstantial and ""searched for"" evidence, and only that, it is a great read, if you can't take it as that, you should stick to the Bible, and ask the Lord for insight yourself."
2,One Grain Of Salt Please,"If you've never read anything that deals with the factual history of biblical times, this is a nice introduction. But be aware that the views and conclusions of the authors of this book are to be taken with a grain of salt. They cannot be accused of applying scientific principles to their research and many of their conclusions are based on what they expected to find. A self fulfulling prophecy, if ever I saw one.It would do you more good to read a book that deals with real history by an author who lets you come to your own conclusions.If anything, they've convinced me never to have anything to do with Freemasonry, however square and level they think they are."
1,"Insulting trash, literary and archeological pornography.","I agree with the previous critical review by Steven Wiles. He said it well. I felt constantly assaulted and insulted by the arrogance of these two authors who can't seem to understand how to do proper research, verified and referenced next to nothing, and delighted in their own scintillating takes on history by their own timeline, their own conclusions, and their own self-admiration of their obviously limited ability for research. This book is trash, it doesn't even pass as a good agnostic take. It made me wince repeatedly."
5,Revealing,"I am a Knight Templar,(Commander at that) and find this book to be quite well written. The times may be right for such information to be released, albeit with some resistance. The research seams to be quite exhaustive, with some extrapulation and hypothesis involved. It is quite a span of human history, but, with a common, reoccurring theme that can't be denied. I have read many books concerning this topic and have never seen such a complete history or explanation of the material. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the history of the Christian Church. It is certainly not for the faint of heart, but, can't be denied as a very intelellectual piece of work. The Truth must reign supreme no matter what the outcome of history. More work must be done,, bring this to a conclusion for the sake of sanity."
2,"Interesting story, poor logic","This is a good read for someone interested in the mythical history of freemasonry, but only for the sake of entertainment. The actual logic that carries one precept to another in this book is very poor."
3,Well-written fiction,"This book is well-written, fascinating, and interesting. However, it probably contains more fiction than history, and it certainly contains lots of speculations. I enjoyed reading the book."
4,For an atheist with a broad mind (me) - a cracking read...,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who was also a non-Christian and I found it highly enjoyable and thought-provoking. The staggering amount of research done by Mr. Lomas and Mr. Knight defies belief. I'm impressed. Everything ties in and makes sense, especially the so-called miracles Jesus performed. Chinese whispers and all that. I will now be going on to read the Second Messiah. I recommend this book to Christians and non-Christians alike."
4,"A well written, thought provoking, controversial book.","The implications of the authors findings are a welcome controversy. The Christian world as we know it today would be spun on it's head after reading this book. I welcome this introduction and new light to a Christian world which has been so narrowly closed minded for thousands of years. This book offers an intelligent and refreshing look at a religion that has been staunched in misinterpretation and translations which have been used and taught as literal truths. I hope to see if the Rosslyn Chapel will ever be excavated to determine if their theories hold true! I hope more information from the Dead Sea Scrolls is revealed so that we may see the ""true"" teachings of the man called Jesus the Christ."
5,This book takes precedence over my current reading.,"Upon opening the Hiram Key, I stopped reading another excellent book, James the Brother of Jesus by Robert Eisenman (and his Dead Sea Scrolls books also) -- and will resume only when I finish this great work by Knight and Lomas. They have obviously read Eisenman and much more. I am only half-way thru the Hiram Key, having been sent by it for reference to the Bible, to the Dead Sea Scrolls translations, and to the historian Josephus -- among others including Kugel's The Bible As It Was. The Hiram Key is crammed with interesting facts, speculations, insights, and imagery. This book is a milestone along the quest for a well-founded perspective on the history of religion."
1,Nothing But Speculations,"This is my first review. I write it to warn readers not to waste money buying this book. Several other reviewers in the 1 star category have it absolutely right. I thought this book would be about the founding of Freemasonry. But, the early chapters had nothing to do with this topic. They were so full of speculations, and I mean speculations, about early Christianity that I feel that's all I would get about Freemasonry - speculations, not facts. I won't waste my time reading the rest of the suppositions they hold."
4,Challenges assumptions,"Ahh, this book! if only, like the so-called ""experts"", the authors of this book had an army of graduate students to research their facts and provide them with better documentation. as it is, i get the feeling the authors slept thru the part on writing research papers in their writing classes and that, for whatever reason, they were in a hurry to finish this book.... aside from that, this is a fascinating story that is a great starting point for a deeper look into the horror that has haunted the western world for approximately 2000 years. and remember: the most important book for christians to read--and that so few of them ever will bother to pick up--is the bible. after that, read the torah and the holy koran and maybe you'll start to wonder about some of the things you've had thrown in your face all your life about your religion...."
1,You must be joking,"Would give the item no stars if I could.. Received the item as a present. We have 3 cats and they totally ignore the video. It looks like the video was shot with a low-grade home video camera. In attempt to capture bird sounds the volume was cranked up in a number of shots. This produces a very annoying buzz in many places. Also, very repetitive - the same bird , and for that matter the same shot, keeps coming back... If you have a video camera you can do better in your back yard"
5,Things that are worth the price by themselves:,"George Duke talks about learning from Frank, recording with Frank, and having his perspectives broadened by Frank's challenges.1973 recording-studio footage is included. (Where's the rest, please?)And...Ruth Underwood plays the vibes for you. In her den.In fact, she plays an excerpt from an unreleased Zappa score.Wow. BUY THE DVD. Turn off the repulsive tripe coming from your little hit radio station and learn about how the real folks did it; do something aesthetically kind for yourself, for a change."
2,somewhat disappointed,"Not exactly what I expected; I want video footage of Zappa in concert. There was some, but not enough. This is more of a documentary and while interesting, I want more FRANK."
3,more music less talk,To the die-hard frank fan this historical footage will be invaluable. But to regular fans or to the person who may wear an occasional python boot it will be disappointing. Not enough music and to many interviews.
4,Zapplause for an Informative Film,"Good show with interviews of Zappa band members giving insight to the man and his music. Some good archive performance pieces, but the highlight to me is Dweezil sitting at the mixing board deconstructing a couple of tunes to show the intricate arrangements and layers that gives the music the rich sound that Dweezil said Frank called the ""eyebrows."" I recommend this dvd for all musicians who are interested in orchestration as well as all the Zappa afficionados."
1,terrible,if you think this is music. it is not. it is a documentary. a very poor one at that. watchingsome dude shakin his head in nirvana while moving some volume slides on a console. justterrible.
5,Amazing!,This is one of the best EPs I have ever came across. All three songs are just brutal. I would highly recommend getting this CD with the two bonus demo tracks but if you have the Nightmares Made Flesh special edition with the two bonus track then don't get this version I did by mistake but I still love it.
4,Use it Wisely,"This book should only be used as a guide and the ranking system is very biased. Each person is different and will want to use their own ranking system of importance, but this book does give a concise detail of every school. It sets a good foundation for knowledge about law schools."
1,I did not want a 2003 book,I did not know that I was ordering a 2003 guide to law schools. I never would have ordered it if I had known it was obsolete.

4,Not For Wimps !!,"This title is not for wimps.It reminds me of the days where you used to have to pony up something in the arcades and pay the price to get good at a game.THERE ARE NO SAVES IN THIS GAME.So get good or die.Most of todays spoiled gamers might run from this type of game,but if you are up for a challenge and you think you have got a brain behind your trigger,try this game.Now all that said.This game is far from perfect.The major flaw to me being after wiping out a guard house garrison,having them come and re-spawn to life if a alarm is sounded.that kind of sucks and a patch should have been made.A multi-player would have been nice too but....oh well.This is one of the few games that calls me back to it every so often.I think because the Journey was so rewarding when you were able to complete it.The ending sequence was kinda.... Eh.Sorry to see IGI II got bad reviews,but it is rather buggy.I have tried it"

5,"Watch out Harry, here comes Jason Del!","The Pearl of Anton is a very exciting and adventursome book. If you thought Harry Potter was good, give The Pearl a read and I'm sure you will find Jason Del just as compelling to read. You find you become one of the Dels on their quest for the Pearl and you help to fight off the bantogs as you journey through time. The Pearl is a definite 5 Star rating!!"
4,Doggs Unleashed,"The Doggystyle All-Stars are on to of the West Coast rap game. With the assistance of the crew from Long Beach, who were responsable for a great deal of the material heard on the original Chronic and Doggystyle ( minus Dr.Dre, The DOC and Kurupt). Snoop helps us to remember why we started listening to them in the first place. All the artists step to the mic like the vicious dogs they are, tearing it to shreads. The Lady of Rage distroys all female mc's ( and male MC's for that matter) on the cut ""Unfucwitable"" and Snoop along with RBX rip Suge and Death Row a new a-hole on "" The Strong Will Eat The Weak"". Soopafly and E-White also show that they are lyrists of top quality on many of the albums cuts. With production from the likes of DJ Premiere, Hi-Tek, Fred Wreck, EZ Elpee and Alchemist to complement the lyrical gangbang, this album is top notch. The only aspect that I disliked was the 2 or 3 R&B tracks, they simply didn't fit."
4,Classic Snoop Joint,"this cd is tight. snoop is back with a gang of talent. he definitely keeps it real. get this cd, even if you hate rap, the beats are so tight, the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because the lyrics can get weak at some times, but overall a must have for any music fan!!! hottest tracks - #3 (Not Like It Was), #5 (Doh Doh), #11 (Don't Fight The Feelin'), #12 - (Unfucwitable), #13 (The Strong Will Eat the Weak), #20 (Light That [...] Up)!!!"
2,Not true to CCR,"I agree with the first reviewer in that these recordings are not true to the CCR sound and bare little resemblance to the song after the first few bars. The music, however, is excellent but the recordings just don't sound like the songs, which, I presume, is why you might buy this CD.Some of the other ""Pickin' On"" recordings, e.g., the Springsteen, ZZ Top and the most excellent Rolling Stones set, are much more true to the melodies and rhythms of the originals."
4,Wild West Australia,"Zane Grey does for Australia what he did for the American Southwest, and this is: Make it the place to be! The master of descriptive prose has given the uninformed reader a journey, a travelogue, of what it would be like to cross the Australian Outback. And in spite of the period of history it is set, a suspect the trip would be much the same today. Through the eyes of two American cowboys, Australia comes alive for the reader--the flora, the fauna, the heat, the dust, the water, or lack there of, the strange and the exotic are all displayed. There are rustlers, and stampedes, and romance as well, or it wouldn't be Zane Grey. It is great to at last to be able to read the full work, not some abridgement."
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I only bought this CD because I wanted a good recording of Cvm Rhondda. Well I got that and much more. Myfanwy is just wonderful. I didn't know who Bryn Terfel was, but now I'm a fan."
2,"Love Bryn, not this album","As a bass/baritone opera singer and lover of men's voices, I have long appreciated the work Bryn Terfel has done. However, this album is an obvious exploitation of Mr. Terfel's name and reputation in order to try to make some money. The pieces are monotone and uninspired. Sorry, can't recommend that anyone waste their money."
4,Surprisingly beautiful music and quite touching,"I just got this CD and I'm absolutely dazzled by it! The overture is one of the BEST overtures I've ever heard! The song FRiends, The Best of is one of the most gorgeous pieces of music I have ever heard. How Far is Too Far is also beautiful. Little Fat Girls is heartbreakingly beautiful. WHoever orchestrated those songs is a GENUIS!BUY IT!"
5,You Can Never Go Home Again,"You Can Never Go Home Again by Dyan Sheldon is about a girl, Angel, and her famliy that split up,and she's forced to move. The house they move into is occupied by the ghost of a young boy name BJ. He lives in the attic and the only person who knows about him is Angel's little brother. Dyan Sheldon uses strong descriptive and visual words that make you feel like the ghost is standing next to you while you are reading. Anyone who enjoys books about ghosts and suspense must read You Can Never Go Home Again. I give it five stars!"
5,Great Tool,"This works perfect on palm plants. The long handles keep your hands away from the sharp limbs/leaves. This tool should last a liftime. Mine came with red handles, not green as shown in the pictures."
3,So-so,"I wouldn't recommend this book for new residents. Too dry, facts are slanted toward the monetary rather than the ""interesting"" side of history."
3,The history of the state of Nevada.,"I picked this book up while I was in a museum in Reno. The author is the brother of the former U.S. Senator from Nevada, Paul Laxalt. I took a few tours while I was in Reno (along with some gambling)and when I later read this book, I knew what book my guides had read, prior to doing their job with the tourists. I doubt if any state's history can be made interesting, but Laxalt does a good job. Nevada is an interesting state compared to the rest of the nation, and the author relates why: precious metals, prize fighting, easy divorce, legal hooking and gambling. All in a state that is at heart very conservative.This is a short read, and for those who travel to Vegas or Reno often, a necessary read. Why did Nevada become the way it did? The book answers this question and details some of the interesting characters of Nevada (Mark Twain, Bugsy Seigal, along with a number of politicos). At a little over 130 pages, this is a great read to take on the plane to Vegas."
1,Legendary Urban Stars is NOT Johnny Winter,"Warning! Legendary Urban Cinema Stars is NOT Johnny Winter in concert! Amazon has a mix-up with their product description and product item number. Legendary Urban Cinema Stars is actually a DVD box set of 12 movies made in the 70's starring African-American (urban) actors. Movies like ""The Black Godfather"" are in this set. There is no concert footage at all."
3,So-so bottom rung grunge,"I go this CD right when it came out - I was a huge grunge fan at the time, listening to things like Tad, Gruntruck and Mudhoney. Sprinkler is not up to par with the better known bands of the time - they are OK, and showed potential, but never quite connected. The first song ""Wide Zero"" is quite good, and there are a few other decent tunes on this CD, but probably half of the songs are forgetable. The vibe is sort of creepy and depressing - appropriate for the time it was released, but sort of dated sounding now. I would recommend this only for grunge diehards or people really interested in fully exploring the SubPop catalog."
3,"Not bad, but not essential grunge either...","Sprinkler (among several other Portland based bands) is one of the overlooked, underrated bands that flew well below the radar during the grunge era in the early nineties. Unfortunately for them, it was during the time when Sub Pop financially imploded under its own weight. ""More Boy, Less Friend"" is not a bad release per se, but it fails to deliver it's share of memorable tracks. You won't find many catchy riffs or hooks on this one; although I will say that the last track, ""Landlord"" is quite a little gem. It earned them a little attention in the long run. For the grunge enthusiast, I would say check it out; others will be less than impressed."
4,A Different Case,The case I recieved was different from the one showed but works just as well and seems to be a good product.
3,Cover should be a case,"The cover is just fine, however you remove the unit and place the cover on it for storage. It would be better if the unit was in a case to protect the pins on the back. The cover does nothing to protect the back."
5,Good product,This fits well on my Garmin Fishfinder 140 and it seems to be made of a material that will offer solid protection.
1,boring,"I found this video to be extremely slow and boring. The set was really uprofessional as well. The pace was way too slow, and I really hated the use of the woman's child to illustrate the moves."
2,I was not happy with this video,"I purchased this video for my 8 and 9 year olds thinking it would be a true introduction to Yoga. This video bored my 4 year old neice to tears! This is defintely for the 3 year old age group. Thinking it would be a mini work out was a mistake. More time was spent acting silly, looking at zoo animals and learning about nature than was spent on actual fitness. If you need to keep very young children entertained for 20 minutes - this is for you."
2,I was disapointed with Yogakids for several reasons,"This video was purchased for my daughter, Age 5, who has a good sence of balance and long attention span. The length of time spent explaining and demomstrating the poses is not long enough. I have found that pausing the tape, re-explaining the pose and helping her adjust her position is the only way that she learns the poses. There is nothing said about how to adjust the pose for comfort or where you should feel the strech. The animal segments between the poses are distracting and disturbs the continuity of the ""work out"". The animal noises suggested may be intended to encorage the chidren to enjoy yoga but I feel it detracts from the sence of peace and relaxation you feel after your practice. My daughter is in such a hurry to make the noise that the pose becomes secondary. I will purchase a book and use that to help us form our yoga practice. This tape will not be used."
3,Gentle introduction to yoga mixed with New Age philosophy,"I rented this video from the library before purchasing to make sure it was what I wanted. After watching it, I don't think I'd buy it. I'll probably look into some other exercise options.Yoga Kids is a pretty good yoga introduction for kids ages 4 to 6 (once you fast forward through about 15 minutes of credits, commercials and legal warnings about exercise). Basically, the narrator uses examples from nature to teach various yoga poses. The production value is good and the children are modestly dressed and good models of the poses.Christian parents should be aware, however, that there is a good deal of New Age philosophy mixed in with the instruction. This is the main reason I'm rating it 3 stars. (If you don't find this kind of philosophy objectionable, you'd probably rate it higher.)"
1,"Uninspiring, challenging workout if you can stay awake.","I was looking for a fast paced, upbeat exercise ball workout. I did not find it in this video. This video is slow and dull. The workout was difficult but after watching it once I know I will never put it in the VCR again. This is a high priced video and I was expecting alot more than I got."
2,some problem areas,"I am a yoga instructor. I bought this video for my niece but decided to return it. I thought the format was fragmented and somewhat confusing. There was too much footage of actual animals and not enough of the kids doing the poses. The narrator referred to Mountain pose but did not give instruction for it. Also, there is some disagreement in yogas circles about the teaching of Headstand, an advanced posture that was included in this video. I did like the original songs by Marcia Wenig."
4,Fun intro to yoga for young children,"I almost passed up this video because of some reviews I had read. But when we saw it at the library, I decided to give it a try...and my 4 year daughter liked it so much she wanted to do it again and again! I found it to be a good video to introduce the concepts yoga to children. There is a small segment between each pose with shots of animals, which helped my daughter better undersand the pose (so don't expect the same ""flow"" as an adult yoga session). Though it says ages 3 to 10, this video is better geared towards the younger end of this age range."
2,Boring even for my 4 year old,"I failed to heed the warnings of the parent reviews... and bought this thinking it'd be great for my preschooler and 6 year old. It took FOREVER to get through opening credits and warnings. There's so much space between movements that after each one, my kids thought it was over! This video is simply awful because it's so boring. My kids know what a yoga workout looks like and they were very confused that there was so much added ""fluff"" to their yoga tape. My 4 year old has NEVER uttered the words ""this is boring"" in his life and has the patience of a saint...and he said it within 5 ten minutes of the tape (and I had already fast-forwarded throught he credits)."
4,"Bonjour, Mr. Satie","Bonjour, Mr. Satie is a wonderful book for children. As readers wait to hear the outcome of the story, they will find de Paola's book anything but dull. The book combines de Paola's usual talent for telling stories and illustrating them with flair with a glimpse into realistic events at Gertrude's salon. Children don't need to know Gertrude to enjoy the story, but when reading this story to them, you may want to tell them that Satie, Pablo (Picasso), Alice (Toklas), and Henri (Matisse) are real people who painted, composed, and wrote. Tell children that Alice made a cookbook, that Pablo painted a famous portrait of Gertrude, and that Gertrude wrote a poem about Pablo. Use this opportunity to expose children to paintings by Picasso and Matisse. Bonjour, Mr. Satie should be read because of its valuable lesson for children to appreciate difference and diversity in their lives and to encourage others to look at things (art and people) as different instead of good and bad."
5,A Good Brief Introduction,"""How To Do SM"" books seem to come in three sizes, small booklets, mid-sized books and large textbooks.""Learning The Ropes"" is an excellent small booklet on SM. You can read the whole thing in about an hour and it will get you on the right track. The author is a very experienced leatherman who is well known in his community and knows what he is talking about. There are also a number of examples of SM play that are good to read and they involved various genders and roles.All in all, this book puts an accurate and human face on SM. I highly recommend it.Other small booklets on SM include ""The Sexually Dominant Woman"" and ""Consensual Sadomasochism"". Good mid-sized books are ""The Loving Dominant"" and ""The Master's Manual"". For textbook-sized books, read ""Screw The Roses Send Me The Thorns"" and ""SM 101""."
2,"Good optics, useless compass.","Beware of these binoculars.The optics are good but there seems to be a fundamental problem with the compass.On the first pair, the compass was very blurry and unable to be read with the binoculars horizontal.These were sent back.Not only did the compass of the replacement pair have exactly the same problem,it had the additional problem of sticking badly as the binos were moved, even if the movement was slow and in the horizontal plane.I would be very wary of buying these without being able to check them first."
1,Strategic Customer Care -- basic marketing with old fads,"The book rehashes various old fads and repeats some very basic marketing principles (such as the value of segmentation) that can be found in any basic marketing textbook. I could not find any new ideas in the book, which seems rather useless."
4,"Great carrier, but one major flaw","I love the concept of these bags. I used them for vacation, and instead of making trip after trip to the car, I put all of the little stuff in the bags and just rolled it out at once. The only problem was that coming back home, I cleaned off the bottom of the bags before I put them on the car, but they still scratched the top of my suburban (which REALLY would have bothered me before I had kids). Overall, the bags are great, but don't get too far from a car wash."
2,Looks are deceiving.,When I received the pendant I was not happy with the fact that it was so small. I can hardly see the dragon. It was a lot of money for what I got but had to keep it since I had no time to get another piece of jewelry.
3,Not worth it...,"This product seemed okay at first, but it is clearly made quite cheaply. The actual ""pillow"" is an air-filled plastic that is made in China. The pillow is sent with a hand pump that you need to use to inflate it. There is not enough pillow to let baby's entire body rest around your side for the football hold, and the back support is minimal. After using this product for one month, the pillow began to leak and deflate requiring us to get a new breastfeeding pillow. I have used the ""My Brest Friend"" previously and I am getting this item as a replacement. I wish that I had gotten it initially."
5,what fun,"This quick read was a lot of fun. I love how it was written and weaved into historical characters. If you enjoyed ""For Colored Girls"" you will like this book."
4,Promote Yourself,"This book ties PR with personal image, and offers advice to women that are working to position themselves on the career market. Read along with Michael Levine's ""Guerrilla PR"" in order to fill any gaps that Gold may gloss over. Overall, this is not any ordinary PR book, and a must-read for business women."
4,Interesting,"Dr. Brian Weiss offers an interesting perspective and possibilities on life and life after death. If one has an open mind, and does not see their reality based on the five senses, they will enjoy the book."
4,Very insightful,"This book was more technical for me than the previous ones I read, however it equips the reader with techniques and methods on how to meditate and even go into deeper states of relaxation. I first read Many Lives, Many Masters, then Only Love is Real and this is the 3rd one I read, and I think the order I read the books worked very well for me."
4,It's a great book!,"For those who interested in power of regression therapy, you should probably read this book or ""Many Lives, Many Masters"" by Dr. Brain Weiss."
3,A lot of repetition.,"The book is great, but it repeats quite a bit of the author's first book. It still had some new material, but it felt like a re-run."
4,"Great ""chapter book"" for early readers!",My 4 year old loves this series. He can't wait until I buy the next in the series! He loves that he can read one chapter at a time and carry the excitement on to the next day. Wonderful story lines that are appropriate for small children without the gore and scary violence of many chapter books.
4,More informative with a better storyline,"I started reading this series to my 4 year old son and recommend it to anyone who wants to broaden their kids adventure geography.The research guides accompanying many of them are very informative and concise...rather they are a must have.This one has a better storyline compared to the rest and covers various l aspects of the Ice Age Apart ..starting with the habitat of the CroMagnon man and how that they made their clothes from reindeer skin and lamps for visibility by hollowing out stones,how they had to hunt other animals like wooly mammoth by making traps in the ground as there were no supermarkets in the Ice Age.For a younger audience (4-6),these books are informative ."
4,Good Book,"I give this book four stars because it educates people of the life of a Neanderthal. I would give it five stars, but there's not much action. But, I think it also educates people about Ice Age wildlife, such as the wooly mammoth. The educational part also includes Neanderthal behavior and beliefs."
4,Sunset of the Sabertooth,"I liked the Sabertooth because he is like a tiger, and is scarey and has long teeth and was very big. He lived in the Ice Age. Annie and Jack went to the tree house and found the portal that took them to the Ice Age. They saw the Sabertooth and they have to get away from him. They didn't have any coats because they were at swimming lessons before they went to the tree house, so they were very very cold, but they were OK. They had an adventure before they came back, and I learned alot about the Sabertooth and the Ice Age. I am seven and I think you will like this book and all the others."
5,Reese loves it!,"I wish I could get all your books and read them in one week...thanks,Reese K (age 5)"
4,This book is about...,Do you like magice tree house books then you would like this book it is about to kids go to a darffient age in time.
4,Santana: Hymns For Peace - Live at Montreux 2004,"People who liked the collaboration between JohnMcLaughlin and Carlos Santana-e.g. ""Love, Devotion, Surrender""will have a chance to see both of the reunited many years later - and even performing compositions from that album. ""Let Us Go Into The House Of The Lord"" and ""A Love Supreme"" really stand out! The addition of Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea and Herbie Hancock from the ""electric"" Miles Davis era is an extra treat!"
2,WARNING ! Jazzer's keep dough in pockets.,"This is a pop extravaganza. The like of which Carlos is only recently known for. (Remember George Benson?) The jazz musicians on the title play for very very little time in any kind of jazz/improv format. The vast majority of the DVD is singers singing non-jazz songs which are backed up by some of the Jazz musicians. There is one jam towards the beginning where they all get about 8 bars. Then later John and Carlos play ""Enter the house of the lord"" ALL and I said ""ALL"" of the rest (even jazz titles) are pop type songs. On the other hand if you havn't had enough of ""The Banana Boat Song"" then this DVD is for you. As for me. My money is gone.But do get the Santana and Shorter DVD. That is great. That cooks.a"
5,"Some great stuff here, jazz purists should keep seeking perfection elsewhere","Hey, if you're a Santana fan from back in the Woodstock days, and appreciate energetic pop music too, and have a special place in your heart for Jingo and Bob Marley's Exodus, then I cant see how you cant not get high off this DVD and Santana's authentic spiritual vibe. A true master has assembled a great band for a great evening to be shared with all. Enjoy. 'Jazz' critics, feh."
5,Great cd!,"One of The Echoing Green's songs was on a various artists cd I own which is Hide. I found out which cd it was on which is the self titled cd. I wanted it for Christmas but I got this one instead. I was dissapointed at first but when I listened to it I thought it was cool. It was more rocky then the other cd I wanted but most of the songs on here our more faster and cooler. This group is also christian and they talk about being close to God and keep looking up to him. I like the whole cd but I really like the songs Liberation, Yesterday's taking over, She's Gone Tragic, Jubilation, Defender and Super Nova. If you are into techno rock music you would luv this cd."
4,New classic,"I have really enjoyed ""Modern Family,"" especially watching the various side relationships that have developed between the characters. It's tough to beat the first season, but this one isn't bad."
4,Great series,This is again a great season of Modern Family. It is worth the money and the time to watch it.
4,Modern Family doesnt disappoint!,"Always hilarious! Another funny season! Just plain fun to watch and difficult to turn off. Love the premise of the show, that families are blended and crazy."
2,"Program fine, amazon service not acceptable","Playback is repeatedly interrupted for ""loading"" often making it impossible to watch. Thought it was my internet connection, but when I ordered another episode from a different season, it played fine."
5,BEAT SEASON EVER,GET GET GET GET IT YOU WILL LAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SO MUCH SO MUCH FUN GET IT. I LOVE THEM ALL AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEM ON TALK SHOWS THAT HAVE THEM ON THEY ARE SO NICE SO SWEET.
1,disappointed,The disk came broken.. The shell was in pieces..we are able to play the disk but at times it stops and it is annoying. very disappointed
5,great entertainment,"Okay, this comedy series can delight all kinds of families. As nutty as they are, they have the same situations we all face in our lives. This is not stapstick in any way, just terrific entertainment. The actors make this show!"
4,Modern Family - Third Series,Purchased as a birthday present for my granddaughter who was really happy with the item. Excellent speedy and efficient service.
5,Love Modern Family,I love modern family. Great show with an all star cast. Problem is my DVR has so much taping on Wednesday nights I normally have to buy the show on Amazon or wait for Comcast on demand to have it.
5,funny show,Really like this show. The cast is still on top of their game. Still entertaining me on a daily basis. Looking forward to more episodes
5,great show,"great show. very funny and family friendly. it's better if you watch it in order rather than here and there, so we get the seasons"
5,Modern Family is the best.,How could you not love Modern Family. Truly one of the best Comedy Series on television. Highly recommended for some great laughs.
4,Modern Family #3,"Purchased for a gift, it was what my son-in-law requested. And it met our expectations, he will enjoy it a lot!!"
2,Conservative Engineering Fantasy,This was recommended to me by an older engineer. It is very dated but a readable story as businessmen and engineers working on a device they don't understand yet are transported to another world from their factory with nothing outside their skin. It turns out people on the surrounding block were also transported. What follows is the secret dreams of engineers as they quickly conquer their surroundings and begin to create a small civilization to make their way back. Their only weak opposition are the religious rubes transported among them who begin to regress. An interesting historical piece but nothing else.I am not a fan of organized religion but I also think those who think they could solve all problems if everybody just gets out of their way have their own quasi-religious delusions. Book is overpriced for Kindle. Check out John W. Campbell and other 50's and earlier Amazing Science Fiction writers on Kindle for better stories on related themes.
5,Million-Dollar Markers,"Wow! I never thought I'd see markers that were so expensive. I figured, ""Something must be great about these markers,"" so I bought them. They write exceptionally well on almost any surface--I was even able to write refueling directions on the glossy-painted fuselage of my learjet! Two months later, the directions are still there! What a convenience!"
5,Simple Awesome,"One of the greatest records I've ever found accidentally.I had no idea about this band but I'm happy I now know them.I just wish I could also find the other record they have.Personally I believe they are/were doing much better than other similar tunes you hear which they've become mistakenly more famous.great, simply awesome."
4,Charming in it's antiquity...,"This is an absolutely necessary for any true Opera buff. Caruso is, with out a doubt the greatest tenor of all time, and this recording shows that well. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the fact that it has a lot of hiss. This is unavoidable since all of the songs were recorded between 1902 and 1910, but I would not recommend buying this set if you cannot stand that sound for long. The technique, the passion... it's all there! It's a good collection of the world's ""pioneer"" tenor."
4,Single CD!,"I recieved a single cd product! The second disc, consisting of arias by other artists in what would make a double cd set is non-existent. It probably was an early promotion, as the Nimbus website (wyastone.co.uk) now lists this product as a single disc as well. However the selections of Caruso recordings included here are arguably his best, and the particular Nimbus transfer method seems to be very appropriate for these pre-electricity recordings. Still recommended highly, with the above reservation."
5,this one is fun to listen to,"it is one of the less boring one; very effective; it doesn't just let u to go through boring drills. i do enjoy listening to the story. the grammar are basics, but good enough for travelling purposes."
4,Easy startup book,Easy to follow & builds confidence fast if you practice the exercises. You still need classes to be able to speak to someone & learn the general colloquialisms.
4,Good way to learn French if you're a beginner,"I came across this book/cd combo and have enjoyed going through 7 lesseons to date. The pronunciation is an eye opener esp if like me you're taken a few lessons as a kid and recall the grammar but no one taught you the right way to pronounce things. However if you expect this or any book to teach you conversational french you might be disappointed like I was when I tried to read an online version of the French news paper lemonde. However this set is well written, well documented and the speakers speak slowly and clearly. Well worth the investment. Though perhaps they say ""Pierre, fermez la porte"" way too many times for my taste:-)"
1,Old product-Unusable,"Unfortunately, I am unable to use any of these candies. I have opened several boxes in hopes some would be usable. The ones I have opened are stuck together and can't be broken into their original pieces. A total loss to me."
4,Chocolate for the Soul,"I bought the CD the day of it's release and I think it is one of best compilation out today. A mixture of acid jazz, funk, hip-hop, and soul. Julie Dexter from the UK out shines (in my opinion) everyone on this CD, but I am not putting any of the other artist down. Her song ""burning"" is one of her best tracks and will most likely never get radio airplay. The other tracks like ""Heaven"" by Satoshie Tomiie from Japan is a BLAZING track and shows off the great production skills that Chocolate Soul Entertainment have. Other tracks that stand out are ""Forbidden Taboo"" by The Committee, ""So Love"" by Kindred, ""Ever After"" by Seek and others. I always admire CSE work in the past and glad to see them come out with this compilation. Go get this one it's a great CD.oNe"
5,Kick your defense up a notch ...,You should already be an above average player before tackling this.-Heavy focus on signaling.-When to mislead partner on defense.- Partnership quizzes - these alone are woth the price of the book
3,Way old.,"I bought this a couple months ago because I was never able to experience the parody to Myst.This game will not work on modern day Operating Systems and the extra content that resides on the web is long since gone.I would only recommend getting this to the Elitist Myst fans out there who want to complete their Myst collection.PS: This game is not written, produced or even endorsed by Cyan, the original makers of Myst. It is a parody."
1,No wonder the game was a flop!,"The item came from Amazon in brand new condition. That I have no problems with A+. Its the game itself, I thought that it was going to be a game that you can play. its not, rather its digital postcards of the island. very sad really, had the promise but failed on delivery. Two thumbs down and only one star. I am suprised that it did not kill John Goodman's career."
3,For Young Readers Only,"I was searching for a book for my own education on marsupials and was disappointed that find that this science workbook is for 6+ year-olds. This wasn't noted in the book notes. I will say that for the younger audience it is interesting though not excellent. It contains some good biological information on critters from possums to echidnas, but also has things as simple as doorknob decorations. Perhaps I'm spoiled by having seen superior books of this nature while in Australia, the land of some fabulous marsupials and marsupial experts."
4,Angry Nature,"Chase Twichell writes poetry beautifully. She has a wonderful sense of rhythm and form. Her poems flow and take the reader along. She is a splendid observer of nature and this shows in her work. She occasionally gets you into the poem and then smacks you in the face with unexpected violence. As an observer and commentator on nature she is comparable to Mary Oliver. But, where Oliver celebrates the beauty and meaning of nature, Ms. Twichell laments it's distruction and loss. Both are probably necessary but the results are quite different. If you are in the mood to be uplifted read Oliver. But if you want ammunition and encouragement in a fight to save the nature we have left, by all means read this book."
3,Great to Hear Reagan ... But Not His Best Speeches,"Any opportunity to hear the Great Communicator is welcomed. However, I found this video woefully lacking. First, I don't think Reagan's top speeches were chosen for the video -- probably due to limited time given the fact that far too much time was spent on lesser speeches. For instance, the speech at the Evangelical Prayer Breakfast where Reagan called the Soviet Union the ""evil empire"" and ""the focus of evil in the world,"" the producers spent at least five minutes before and after those key parts of the speech. One speech in particular that I really wish had been included was the one Reagan made on Normandy beach celebrating the 40th anniversary of D-Day."
2,Haunting and Surreal,"As in all the work of M John Harrison, there is more going on in THE LUCK IN THE HEAD than meets the eye. Part of his metafictional world of Viriconium (a city that changes its name as well as its character in connected stories in his VIRICONIUM fantasies), this tale is brilliantly and darkly brought to visual life by the incredible draughtsmanship of Ian Miller. It is the story of a failed assassination attempt on the life of Mammy Vooley, the bizarre goddess-ruler-thing of Uroconium (as the city is called this time). Too bizarre for some, this will be relished by lovers of Lautreamont, delvers in the arcane, and fans of Harrison's often-oblique but always haunting fictions."
4,Greek Myths,"The item arrived as described, and was actually in better condition than I expected. I give the seller a four star rating in that the item arrived a bit later than expected. I would still do business with them in the future, and happily."
3,Fair,"Purchased for someone else. Heard tell that It wasn't all that he thought it was. Not enough of Bob Marley, who he thinks is Reggae itself."
2,I don't care for it...,My students struggle with the small pieces...wish it was a little bigger. The container is so small it is hard to get the pieces back in there.
3,"Lacks More, Complicated Cards and bigger pieces","I found this toy to be durable and useful for many occasions. It is relatively small, thereby allowing it to be easily packed or stored for travel. As a result, the actual ""tangrams"" are not large enough to be played with large hands. I found that larger and more expensive such kits did not have two sets of tangrams. That is what I enjoyed about this kit. It permits 2 players to compete against each other at the same time to see who can build the specified drawing first. However, because of its size, this game cannot store many cards. One may find that they will quickly construct each and every drawing on the cards. Bigger sets offer 10X - 50X more possibilities for a price that is not too much higher. I would suggest doing some more research about larger kits that promise more ""playtime"" for anyone looking to purchase this item for a friend or family member."
5,Rare Facts and Photos!,"Although in a short, booklet format, this is one my favorite Little House resources because it contains many things you don't find in other bios. I especially love the pictures of Laura and Mary as children (it's neat comparing them to Garth William's illustrations)!You will also love to learn what the future held for sisters Mary, Grace and Carrie.I would wager this little booklet is essential addition to any Little House collection."
1,Lady crackers...?,I couldn't get through this book.I usually like to sit down and finish a romance in one sitting. This book dragged. I couldn't get involved with the characters at all. Duncan was obnoxious instead of charming as he was suppose to be.And do not get me started on 'lady crackers.' One of the worst euphisims I have ever heard.
1,Amnesia in under 300 pages!,"I first read this book some years ago and found it to be boring, mindlessly so. The characters seemed flat the hero so vastly unappealing that the second I put it down (unfinished of course) I forgot what the hell it was about.So recently I stumbled on it again and decided to revisit while flying across the country.Once again I can't even tell you, an hour after finihsing it, character names or anything else. It is that flat, wordy, boring, and unappealing.To be fair I do have ADD so yes, it does take a lot to get my attention and keep it but nothing in this milquetoast of a novel even tries."
5,Zorro in Scotland,"This book by Arnette Lamb, ""The Border Lord"", is at the same timefunny, serious, and titillating. This is a must-read for anyone interested in historical romances, Scottish or otherwise. I have 2 of them just in case a friend needs to have a light spot in the day. In fact, the humor even got a chuckle out of my hubby!"
2,A female diplomat in that era? Highly unlikely.,"I liked the hero. He was kind, loved his son, was determined to protect his people, etc. There were two times when I didn't like him, though: when he met with the heroine by the wall and begged her to love him, and when he gave her the blooded plaid. The first was too humiliating and the second was too cruel. The heroine was totally unlikable. OK, so she had a troubled past, but she still didn't have to behave like a heartless *****. I do believe the hero could do better than her. But the best part of the book was without doubt Malcom."
1,Things are not what they seem...,When I bought the GBA Power Pak I was very upset. It worked for some time but soon it's internal circuts had melted themselves. I was very upset and when I went back to batteries the light on the GBA which tells you how much power you have left by going from green to red when would keep flashing back and forth from one to the other. I never recommended it to anyone and I recommend that you don't purchase it.
2,power pak,I have been researching alot of these rechargable systems for my son. I thought this power pak was ok at first glance but very quickly realized that it has to go with the unit so it can be recharged when not in use. It is big and takes up alot of room in the case I purchased. I ended up getting a smaller unit instead.
1,Bad Idea,"I would defently not recommend this for a few reasons:- It is way to big- It is not lisenced by Nintendo, so it may damage the systemYou would probably be better off getting the $19.99 GBA AC Adapter which is an official Nintendo product."
5,awesome DVD set,"Just watched the Mexico City concert... totally rocks!For the price Amazon is offering it for, this is a great deal.The track listing for the Audio CDs is a little messed up. In Remembrance is the first track of the second disc, not the last track of the first disc. But whatever.Buy these DVDs!!!"
4,Celebrators of Becoming,4DVD and 2CDDVD content a lot of shows and additionnal rare stuff that Therion's fan should enjoyCD are the audio tracks of DVD1
4,I like this product,I have two of these mats and I am buying more. I think they remove more litter form my cat's paws then a regular floor mat and the water proof backing is great. I haven't washed my mats yet so I am not sure how they hold up after a washing.
4,It Works,"What is there to say, it catches the cat litter my cats throw out of the box. No problems with it, haven't washed it yet, but appears to be able to handle that easily."
3,"Nice looking, not really effective","I am not dissatisfied but I'm not impressed with this as an overall litter catcher. It doesn't really get the litter off of kitty's paws, but it looks a lot nicer than a towel."
5,the best little cookbook in France,"This was the most charming and most helpful cookbooks I have ever used. As a grad student, I have little time and little money and the quality of life I experience has increased 1000-fold thanks to the instructions in de Pomiane's book. I especially recommend the Alsatian dumplings and the varied sauces for meat. There is something here for everyone, and his injunction to enjoy life by cooking well in a limited time has been welcome in my life. By promising very limited cooking time for his recipies, I have been able to experiment more in the kitchen and to pay more attention to the quality of my cooking instead of making the usual tried and true. If you are not a ""foodie"" by nature but you recognize the value of good cooking in your own life, I cannot recommend this little book more strongly."
5,Simply delicious!,"This is one of my favorites among the cookbooks I own. I love to cook, although I hate recipes. Edourad de Pomiane's approach is perfect. His writing is funny and encouraging, and he teaches you to cook rather than simply giving instructions to copy a specific recipe. His recipes are exquisitely simple yet profoundly delicious. This one book changed the way I cooked steak, gave me confidence to try sauces for the first time, and taught me the key to making perfect omelets. Buy it. You won't regret it!"
3,An Okay Book,"Unlike another reviewer of this book, I like recipes. The art of cooking has been perfected that a chef can create something appealing to suit many taste buds (and be perfected to a persons taste with a few dashes more of seasonings - everyone tastes are different). I wish the publishers of this book would have specified that this is more of a 'guess how much should go in the pot and you have yourself a dish recipe' book. There are few actual recipes here and more of a commentary such as put a little in a pot, simmer with a bit of this and add a pinch of that. NOT HELPFUL. I'm sure the recipes are nice, but again, I 'm sure I will be selling this book. I can not use it. I should have looked at it somehow, first. If you are not a seasoned cook and are not willing to guess up a dinner, avoid this book. Sad to say, I didn't."
4,Some good ideas,This sweet little book has some good ideas - even in the context of today's hectic and technology driven lifestyle. I appreciate the authors notes on proper behavior and subtle wit.
3,Cute little book on French philosophy and cooking,"I saw this book recommended in another book...Search for civilization by John Armstrong. Ordered it and was rewarded with a cute little book, somewhat out of date (published in 1930's), but none the less relevant. Simple but direct."
1,P-U,"I had watched the trailer for this....movie shall we call it? and I could tell it was going to be over the top camp with really amateurish acting, but the trailer looked funny so I thought why not, it might be good for a few laughs. Unfortunately, the funniest bits were in the 3 minute trailer. The rest of this one hour ""film"" was pretty lame. The same jokes over and over. And if you're going to make a campy gay mockumentary about porn the very least you should do is show a little full frontal. I mean.....hello people, where's the beef?! The only reason I gave it one star (and not zero stars) was for the two hot butt shots we got to see of the lead actor. The $1.99 rental was $1.98 too much."
1,Don't waste your time.,"If you have the patience for stereotypes, then this is movie for you. If not, avoid this one at all costs."
2,eh it was eh,I thought it would be alright but like for the 5 mine it didn't look interesting.. jsDid not catch my interest which I thought it woulld.
4,Great behind the scenes look at female cops.,I read the excerpts in the Chicago Sun-Times. The rest of the book was equally as interesting. You wonder how female cops can survive in the macho world of law enforcement. This book shows you how they do it--by going their own way and working hard!
1,"Tacky, tacky, tacky","Half of the proposals suggest that you stand there, dressed in a tux holding roses, looking like a dope. The other half suggests doing banal things like tying a ring around your pet's neck.I was really hoping to find some classy, clever, sharp, and intelligent suggestions to spark my own creativity...not suggestions for me to write on a billboard how much I love her and then to climb a ladder on to the edge of the sign dressed in a tuxedo.If you know the difference between clever and tacky, you will not be happy at all with this book."
3,Blue Oyster Appetizer,"I certainly can't find fault with any of the songs here. But what I can do is direct you to the double antholgy ""Workshop Of The Telescopes,"" which has a more complete selection. BOC is a band that recorded at least four must-have albums and a load of super cuts in their later years, so this set seriously under-represents them. On the other hand, if all you want is ""Don't Fear The Reaper,"" then by all means, go for it."
4,Very good compilation - not perfect but still...,"It is understandable that a compilation of Blue Oyster Cult can never be perfect. First, people have different tastes and, god knows, BOC tried quite a few styles. Second, they have more than twenty songs that can qualify for such a collection. Finally, there are no perfect compilations in the world - we'll have to live with that. Anyway, almost every song here deserves to be on the record. Except perhaps for ""In Thee"" - it just doesn't quite cut it. I would definitely replace it with ""Veteran of Psychic Wars"" and/or ""Sole Survivor"" - both are absolutely better songs. Other than that I don't really have any objections (see above the starting comments, though)."
4,I think I know one of the movies Arin,"In reply to Arin Gragossian's query regarding a movie that used ""Don't fear the reaper"" in it's opening title sequence. Try the movie adapted from the Stephen King Novel called ""The Stand"". Probably not the only film but it is definately one of them. It's a top track"
5,One of a Kind,"Oddly, anyone who would use the term ""Cult Classics"" could apply it to Blue Oyster Cult. The best of their Eerie/ unique songs are here. The power guitar bring the haunting yet beautiful melodies home such as "" (Don't Fear) The Reaper""' ""This aint the Summer of Love"", ""The City's aflame of Rock and Roll"". Like Alice Cooper without the stage act. A great package."
3,meh!,Would prefer the live versions of the songs that I remember from my college days - still some classic stuff here just not up to my memory. I listened once and filed it away....
2,DON'T FEAR THE MILKMAN,"B.O.C.'s record label is at it again, milking as many GH packages of their songs. Don't get me wrong, the songs are great. But I was grateful for HEAVEN FORBID and CURSE OF THE HIDDEN MIRROR to rise out of incubation."
2,A Nostalgia Trip Gone Horribly Awry,"After you peruse the few decent riffs BOC stumbled upon, what's left? Spinal Tap without the satire. I never got the whole ""career of evil"" vibe. These schlubs from Long Island are about as menacing and nefarious as, well, a bunch of schlubs from Long Island. Motorhead they ain't.Prime lowlights: the atrocious Don Kirschner spoken-word mess in ""The Marshall Plan"", the howlingly awful ""Joan Crawford"", and the cheesy synths too numerous to mention. I'd say BOC is dated, but was BOC ever relevant?"
3,Don't Fear The Reaper,"I got Blue Oyster Cult's-Don't Fear The Reaper for 1 song...that. I came out liking 3 of 'em. Yet, Don't Fear The Reaper is 1 of my all time favorite songs. Namely, due to it being a song on Stephen King's list (The Dark Tower) saga. A die-hard Constant Reader"
3,Their One Good Song - A Touch Overpriced?,"I should start by saying that I love this song - hey, who doesn't?! But I think it's a little unfair that the one good song on this eponymous album is priced higher than all of the rest of the songs. It poses and interesting thought experiment though - do they price it higher because they know it's the only one anybody likes and the only one anyone's likely to download, or are they trying to convince the buyer somehow that they're better off for their money's worth to go ahead and buy the whole album, the rest of which you'll honestly never listen to, but manage to convince yourself that you just might... someday... if itunes deletes all your other downloads... and you're desperate. Oh well, I suppose in the end it's just 30 cents, but it still seems cynically silly for them to have priced it like this..."
2,ANOTHER ONE?,"Blue Oyster Cult has some outstanding songs, especially on this cd, but WHY, WHY, WHY???!!! Why didn't CBS market IMAGINOS like they should? There is NO need for efforts like this. I have no qualm with the songs, just another GH package."
1,Go with the original,"I previously owned chess advantage I and I improved my chess skills greatly. Somehow I lost the cd and unfortuatly when I went to purchase it again all they had was the second one. I would have to say the second one is horrible compared to the original one. Also, the price of the first is much better I give chess advantage I 5 stars"
3,not for marley fans,"I wanted to love this album, but I just couldn't. My one-year-old has been listening to (and loving) Bob Marley since the womb, but unfortunately, this CD was not very entertaining for him. I've played it for him about 3 or 4 times, but he doesn't dance or clap his hands. (He always dances and claps to Bob Marley's music, and he practically goes nuts when his babysitter puts on modern reggae.) The tracks on this CD don't sound like classic reggae or modern reggae. They are more like interpretations of what someone thinks a kid would like. To all whose kids like this CD, kudos. But, this mom, unfortunately, is still on the hunt for more music."
5,Wonderful!,Wonderful CD---my baby girl and I listen to it all the time. You really can't go wrong with any of the Putumayo music collections!
2,Just a heads up.,"Hello,I happen to just borrow this CD from a good friend of mine and didn't find it that appealing. Note I'm a huge Putumayo fan. I love a lot of their stuff (Arabic Groove, Rumba Flamenco, Coffee Lands, and more). In terms of what I don't like is it doesn't really give me a good ""reggae"" feeling. This CD may be great for those who like it and listen to it a lot. However for those new in this department I'd recommend finding something a little more ""popular."" Anyhow as I said just a heads up to those new to the reggae scene. I hope you find my post at all helpful.Have a nice day."
1,More than disappointed,"If you find the following passage, 'Red as roses, Red as red, Red as the eyes, In a rabbit's head' lyrical, then buy this book, as that is only the first page. It keeps going without improvement: ""White as a fish, When you eat a white fish, On a milk-white dish.' When I attempted to so criticize this sainted late author yesterday, my power suddenly went out from a lightning strike; nonetheless, it bears repeating: one successful children's book is not per se qualification to greatness for any hurriedly slapped-out tripe in the name of cuteness. I had purchased this book by catalog, based solely on the author's name and that my daughter seemed to have enjoyed ""Goodnight Moon,"" hoping, of course, to teach her colors and not actually confuse nor frighten the child. More than disappointed, I am angered that so little care, in general, is taken in producing books for children. My copy is now in the recycle box. I wouldn't want to expose it to a poor child."
3,Was this a first draft for The Color Kittens?,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm a huge fan of Margaret Wise Brown. This book shares several lines with The Color Kittens (also by Margaret Wise Brown), and in my opinion The Color Kittens is much better executed, with better illustrations. I'd recommend purchasing The Color Kittens and skipping My World of Color."
1,Poor Sound Quality,"This phone is only a good buy if you don't want to hear the person you are talking to. The reception is so bad and there is such an echo that you can only hear half of what the other person is saying, and this is only made worse when there is any ambient noise whatsoever. I would greatly suggest spending a little extra and buying a better phone."
3,Sometimes I cannot hear..,"I wanted a basic cordless. This 900 mhz does not allow me to go as far as my old one. The most recent problem I have had is that I cannot hear the caller on the other end for sometimes the entire call, other times it fades in and out, maybe due to weather?. Otherwise it suits my needs. I like the rocket dial feature and the price."
2,Um,"I hate to say this but I found no difference in the effects of this toothpaste than other paste I've used. Yes, it did help whiten my natural and bonded teeth ""a bit"", but not significantly enough for me to say that it was a good investment. I will not be purchasing this product again. Sorry"
2,Didn't make my teeth much whiter,"From reading previous reviews, I thought this toothpaste would actually make my teeth white. It didn't. It made them a little bit cleaner and they do look a little better, but now I'm also considering to use whitening strips because I KNOW those make a difference to your teeth."
3,Made my teeth feel clean,With long time use I'm sure this product whitens great but I didn't really notice dramatic results; which is what we all want and if it isn't dramatic then most of us hardly notice a difference. Probably great for maintenance after professional whitening. I will definitely use supersmile after having my teeth whitened.
2,Expensive and results do not match hype,"I used this for two months, with and without the accelerator. The toothpaste was effective at removing mild stains but was no more effective than other ""whitening"" toothpastes I have tried that can be purchased at discount stores for 1/4 to 1/10 the cost. It did not ""whiten"" my teeth to any significant degree and did not seem to impact significant stains. The accelerator had no added benefit. This stuff is just way too expensive to be delivering results on par with much less expensive toothpastes."
3,small change in whiteness,"Have been using this toothpaste for two or so weeks, have not noticed a big change in the whiteness of my teeth. It suggests you use it on a dry toothbrush which makes it a bit unpleasant to use. The taste is fine, just no big change in the color of my teeth. Maybe I have to give it more time."
3,Supersmile Toothpaste,"The toothpaste is okay, I don't feel that my teeth are clean after I use it, so I have to use another brand of toothpaste after I brush with Supersmile. Maybe I should have gotten the accelerator to use with it."
1,BEWARE... BURNS GUMS!!!,"If I could give this product no stars I would. I used a pea size amount of the accelerator and the same of the toothpaste and, as directed, brushed for two minutes. After only one use, it's going back. It burned my gums so badly that one hour later they are still white, like the color has been drained out of them. I won't be giving this product a fair shot at whitening, I realize, but I don't believe that the seller of the product is informing the public of the damage that it can wreak on one's gums... Not worth it!!"
4,Crazy,"Bought this after reading the reviews and am still shocked at how clean my teeth feel. Its been a month and I'm still surprised that after brushing my teeth it feels as tho I've been to the dentist. For me the dry toothbrush was key. And as others have stated I see a difference with how well it gets in between teeth. Again, its only been a month but I am loving it and I do think my teeth look whiter, which is really why I purchased the toothpaste. And just a side note: gave it to my highly skeptical son, and now he wants a tube. So far just a terrific toothpaste (PS: only gave it 4 stars as I always believe everything can use a little improvement but this is a 4 3/4 stars for sure."
5,SMILING BIG TIME :-),I have been using this toothpaste for about 3 years now. Love it and my smile and teeth look GREAT and are nice and BRIGHT. Thank you Dr.Smigle :-)
1,RIP0FF edition,"DANTE AND HIS ITALY, paperbackThis scan by robot (as described on copyright page) is impossible to read, a travesty. Blocks of missing text, non sequiturs, and ridiculous typos make nonsense of the content. The disclaimer at the bottom of the copyright page should be quoted in Amazon's offering: The publisher ADMITS these unconscionable flaws, claiming that the ""Optical Character Recognition"" scan was to ""keep YOUR (my caps) cost as low as possible."" It keeps the text UNREADABLE. The $25.40 I paid for this Ka-Ka insult to Dante is not low cost. I wouldn't pay 99 cents for it."
5,Brilliant and Searing Power Pop,"Todd once again shows those who ""get it"" that he has always been the finest guitar player of the rock era -- better than Clapton, Page, Satriani etc. This live album captures Todd at his most vital and creative, jamming on tunes that seem to spring fully formed from his fertive imagination. Anyone who claims to know something about music should own this cd, and end the long-simmering guitar god debate with one spin of this disk."
2,The original is MUCH better,"The main reason I enjoyed the first of Kenny Loggins' Children's CDs was because ""Return to Pooh Corner"" seemed so utterly guileless, uncalculated and pure. Sadly, just about everything that was charming about the first volume is completely gone from the second. Instead of unearthing undiscovered gems (like Rickie Lee Jone's ""The Horses"" or Jimmy Webb's ""The Last Unicorn""), Loggins serves up rehashed Disney (and psuedo-disney) movie songs. The lone standout is Loggins' original ""Always, In All Ways."" If you don't have ""Return To Pooh Corner,"" musically it's a better set. If pleasingly sung soundtrack saccharine is not your bag, pass on this."
3,"Maybe OK for bedtime, but overall a disappointment.","I was disappointed. It has some of my favorite ""sweet"" songs-- I love the original versions of ""You'll Be in my Heart"", ""Baby Mine"", and ""Beauty and the Beast"" and was looking forward to having them together on one album. However, I find Loggins' versions to be completely lifeless. Yes, I know all the words, but they are sung in excrutiating slowness impossible to sing along with. If you want something to numb yourself (or your children) to sleep, you may be quite happy with this, but I found it painfully slow and monotonous."
5,Better than first Pooh album,"Fell in love with this beautiful collection after the first play. Even better than the original Songs From Pooh Corner effort. Some truly beautiful songs here. I listen to it when I need to relax -- at home or in the car -- and before I go to bed at night. If you have kids, you really need to have this CD. A real joy! Buy this one!"
2,Not as strong the second time around,"While it's hard to go wrong with Kenny Loggins, this CD was disappointing to me. As a big fan of his previous ""Pooh"" release (Return to Pooh Corner), I expected to love his latest CD just as much. I found it a bit flat ... not as engaging or heartwarming as ""Return to Pooh Corner"" at all. If you own neither, I suggest passing on this CD and going straight for the first one."
5,A wonderful collection of songs for little ones!,I play this for my baby every night before bedtime. The music is lovely - so sweet and relaxing. It's the perfect lullaby.
2,it was ok.,i had high hopes for this cd. i was disappointed cuz i only liked one song but thats just me. it might work for you.
3,Kenny Loggins more songs from pooh corner,I adore Kenny Loggins and I have the frist pooh corner cd. This one was not quite up to what I expected. There wassome good songs but it did not live up to the frist one.
1,Already thrown away.,"This case looks very cute in the picture, but once you put it on, it sticks up so high off the iPod that it's ridiculous and makes the buttons hard to touch."
1,wrong choice,This book is the same as food lovers guide to herbs and spices. The difference is the table of contents does not let you reference anything in the book individually. Not very useful in a reference book. I bought this one first. Ended up having to buy both. As far as the book itself I would say it's great. Just don't buy this one.
5,Nice!,These cables are not just high-quality they look great! I am very pleased with my purchase these are durable and should last a long time. The connections are perfect and I can't believe how nice they look! Definitely worth the $!
3,"Jacket was fine, but return was lengthy","I ended up returning this jacket because I was given another one after I ordered it. The return process took rather long - about two months I think before I got credit.The product was fine and it was shipped promptly. I did eventually get credit for my return, but I thought that it took too long."
2,$50???,"Since when is a 12 song CD EVER worth $50??? Maybe a best of NIN that had hidden stuff on it. I'll give them credit for the little I heard of them (which was really good) but no way would I pay $50. I'll just watch Dude where's my car and watch the Stoopid ass video. If you paid that much, you're a bigger fan than I."
4,Chris McCormack back with a vengeance,"so this is chris McCormacks new band huh. nice to see he's still producing wicked tune after wicked tune, u can hear a lot of three colours red on this cd which shows he must have been one of the main influences in songwriting in 3 colours red. this is a sweet cd, kinda change of the new metal with a dj theme by havin punk with a dj. no doubt will get slagged off for it but i think its cool"
3,Not the Same....,"This recording is merely okay. It is inferior to the French version in nearly every way! Firstly, the translation is miserable (It's even worse in the songs that aren't on this CD). The words simply aren't as beautiful.Also, some of the vocalists just don't fit. Natacshia St-Pierre has a decent voice, but I don't think that it fits with the character of Fleur-de-Lys-- Julie Zenatti is much better suited. And Steve Balsamo is nothing compared to Patrick Fiori as Phoebus. The others are well cast... and are the same as on the French album, except for Tina Arena, who actually sings quite well.Conclusion: Get the album in the original French!"
1,Tina Arena SUCKS!,"Overrated singer, with a very ordinary voice. She's a liability to this recording (as if the bad reviews weren't bad enough!)"
2,"Show's A Major Hit, Album's A Major Miss","I agree with the first reviewer. The singing is great on this album, the music is great, however, there is so much missing here.First off, the performances (although sung well here) are totally dull and flat. The French album and the live performance are full of energy that is entirely lacking here. It's all ballads and nothing that holds your attention for the length of the cd. I can listen to the double French album all the way through and stay attentive to it, and I don't speak French. This one cd English version is dull and boring- I can't believe they let this go out in this state.As well, this album in no way tells the story, it's bits and pieces.If you like the French recording and speak English - get it..but don't be expecting something great!"
2,Don't waste your time or money!,"Sadly, I have heard better! I just bought the ""2000 Original Cast Recording"" and was a little disappointed. I have seen nearly all major musicals from L.A. to London, and this one just didn't match up. I thought that this was going to be a little more like ""Les Mis"", ""Phantom"", or even ""Martin Guerre"", but it turns out to be an over cooked bad example of modern musical theatre. I think that perhaps the writers wrote the piece in a few days rather than a few years. I hate to admit it but Disney has a better version out that will be traveling to London and Broadway soon. And in my opinion this version will be soon forgotten! The sadest part is that the performers are very talented but the material gives them very little room for excellence."
1,"~Stop the torture, please!!!!~","What can I say? All I can say is that this is crap, crap, and crap. Lets go over all the things that are wrong with this CD. First and foremost the lyrics are trivial and lack the power of the French version. The enlish lyrics lack the emotions and the power of the French. Second, the performers are not singing at their best. I love Garou and Lavoie, but they always sound good. Tina Arena lacks all of the voal emotions of Helene, even though her vocal power is strong. Natasha St-Pierre's voice, in my opinion, is too raspy, deep, and dark for the innocent and light Fleur-de-Lys. My thumbs down, however, have to go to Steve Balsamo. He DOES NOT convey Pheobus as he is meant to be. Please DO NOT waste your time and money on this CD. If you want to hear what Notre Dame de Paris was MEANT to sound like, purchase the DVD or the double-cd."
2,Too many love songs on this CD,"If I want love songs, I can listen to top 40.For musical theatre, I prefer drama, though Broadway almost inevitably throws some romance in.This CD is dominated by love songs.Furthermore, this CD seems like a compilation of songs, rather than the entire story, so they do seem like just love songs absent strong characterisation."
1,Tina Arena flop!,This recording fails primarily due to casting overrated non-talent Tina Arena.Get another recording. ANY other recording.
1,The dullest musical ever.,"I was very disappointed with the English version: Boring, repetitive tunes with embarrassing lyrics. But a friend talked me into seeng the show on video, claiming it would be wonderful in its original language. But no, it is as boring live.This show (which screams for dark Sweeney Todd-esque music) consists of long, repetitive ballads, one after the other, beating each other to death. The best part is the death of some of the main roles at the end: They die in hilarious, overacted ways, and the show is finally over.I must admit there are one or two acceptable songs in this score, but unfortunately they drown in the other horrid numbers.The Disney version of this story was more touching, which is rather scary."
1,Can't stand Tina Arena's voice!,"The girl sucks! She's got one of the worst voices in the industry, and she's definitely NO Lea Salonga (who's got one of the best voices in the world). She's a liability in this CD."
2,Dismal,"This is without a doubt the most boring concept album I have ever purchased and I am extremely disappointed. I love the double French cd that is full of energy and drive and great music. The music on this cd is VERY repetitive, dull, and entirely boring. They are all (for the most part) slow numbers. Some of the good ones are ""God You Made The World All Wrong"" and ""Live"" They are great but the cd as a whole is very boring.I forced myself to listen to it many times- hoping for it to click and it didn't.Don't waste your money- wait for a complete CAST recording."
3,Okay,"While not a match to the French recording, this album features some good singing, foremost among them Celine Dion's. Comebacking has-been starlet Tina Arena should feel honored being mentioned in the same sentence as the multi-awarded international theater star Lea Salonga."
4,beautiful music,I love Celine's voice; the music contributed nicely to her wonderful presentation of the music. It was a very good recording of Celine and her music.
3,Cd: notre dame the paris,Fine service. Acceptable time period. Too bad the booklet of the cd (with the lyrics inside) was totally wet and therefore impossible to read; pages were stuck together. Maybe the sellercould send me a new booklet..?
3,I prefer the French version,"In France, Notre dame de Paris very successfull. We all loved it. I listened to the English version and I found it lacking: the lyrics seem less poetic and haven't the flavour of the French one save for ""the birds we put in cages"". Maybe it is because, our culturs differ. But I don't think this version will be as successfull, in France however, as was the first one."
4,SO much better in the original,"I loved this musical in the original, not knowing a word of French at the time. When I saw that several of the original performers were reprising their roles in this English version, I didn't hesitate to get it. I wish I had, to be honest.The translation of the libretto is atrocious. Really, really awful. Every so often, you get caught up in the utter loveliness of the music only to be pulled back by the flatness of the lyrics. (NOT the original librettist's fault.) Get the original and translate it with Altavista if you have to. You'll get a better experience.Additionally, a huge amount of terrific songs have been cut.As for the performers themselves . . . the three original performers are terrific, as is Steve Balsamo. Tina Arena and Celine Dion, on the other hand . . . well, I suppose you have to like them.This musical is so good, nothing can make me rate it less than 4 stars. But, if you have a choice at all, get the original French version. It's worth it."
5,Great!!,"I saw this in London over 3 years ago and I absolutely loved it (oh... and i'm an American too). Tina Arena's rendition of ""Live for the One I Love"" is enchanting, though I didn't like Celine Dion's version. Overall, I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoyed the production."
1,Unnecessarily Pretentious,"Well, with musicals and operas I am prepared to brave any amount of darkness and unhummability. I love Sweeney Todd, Les Miserables, and Assassins. However, this struck me as just bad. The songs are unnecesarrily dark (at a party they all sound like they've bathed in the blood of children), the storyline hardly exists (the show looked like a stage version of the selections). The lyrics are just the same line or verse over and over, and the music is always the same melody, yet rising in pitch perpetually. The only character that is even close to well-developed is the priest. The only song that isn't completely inhuman sounding is ""Live For The One I Love"", but it doesn't match the rest of the score and seems as if they just had Jim Steinman graph a song of his on at the last minute. I loved the singing and acting and set, but the play itself is horrible. I would rather be strangled by my own intestines than watch this or listen to it."
4,"If you own French version, compare them","I listened to French version first of all, so I cannot say this is better than that. The sound of French words were much better than English of course. No one can change it.However, the translation and their voice were nice, even thought they were in English. Tina Arena has voice and I like this Phoebus, too. And speaking of Quasimodo, I prefer this version... (I do not like Garou).I watched this in London but it was pretty nice. Don't miss the first tune! It is so great."
3,Lacking in something,"This recording is inevitably compared to the French original of this show, and falls quite short. This English translations of these songs destract from the emotion of the story. The selected songs taken from the show put together like on this recording do very little to show off the fabulous score originally put together. The singers' performances also fall short to the French recording, devoid of emotion and energy (yes I'm including Celine Dion in there too). Is this recording bad? Not completely, I've heard worse things done. Is it good? At times, yes, but up against an impossibly highs standard.Minn If you are interested in this show, go look at the French recording, you won't be disappointed."
3,Spend ....More and get the French Version,"I don't mean to make little of Jennings' talent and I am also the first to admit to having an uphill struggle with french grammar, but the original version of this musical is superior in almost every way. Most notably is the translation of ""le temps des cathedrales"", a beautiful song with an unforgettable melody no matter what language it is performed in. There is however something about the English version (called of course ""The Age of the Cathedrals"") that doesn't bring the listener the same thrills that the original succeeds at. I have been told that the DVD version of the musical in French boasts English subtitles and so urge even die-hard anglophiles to listen to these songs in French. I promise you won't be disappointed!"
