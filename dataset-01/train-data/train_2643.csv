1,awful,"Manipulative, predictable, typical Hollywood trash, with a lot of $$ thrown at it, and maybe even more $$ spent hyping it. The thing I hated the most about this film is that it assumes the viewer has no ability to think. Everything is spelled out for the viewer, giving the film a cheap and cheesy quality. While many of the characters are played-out quite capably, the script, production and direction is terrible. I really wanted to like this movie, since I've seen Kevin Costner in much better films, but this is one he should have skipped."
1,misleading dimentions,The cord measures 3/32 in diameter not 3/16.....I was really disappointed..ithought the cord was heavier...i was wanting something about 1/4 but thought i could use a little smaller
1,Not 3/16 - measures 3/32,"The cord I received is only 3/32"" in diameter. Much too small for my intended use so the buyer should beware. I will keep this as I have other uses for it but if you need 3/16 shock cord, this is not the item to purchase."
1,Mismarked Size - useless!!,"I bought this to repair a chair seat that had 3/16 inch cord, thinking the product would be the right size. It is marked 3/16 on the package, but the (obviously totally incompetent) person who designed the label didn't know that 3/32 is really skinny and 3/16 is 4 times stronger.Don't buy this!! It probably works for tent poles, but not for anything you need actual 3/16 cord for. It will cost more to ship it back than the refund is worth, so I'll toss it in the camping box and see if it ever comes in handy."
4,"Works well, good price, thin cord","Good cord, it is thin, but strong. Works well for almost any kind of pole. But remember to get more than you need b/c you will have to wrap it around the ends and tie it off to get a good few knots. So, get yourself a bit more at this price..."
3,Merchant Jay's Outdoor Supply are dishonest,"I paid about $15 for fastest shipping option but arrived at least 8 days later, after I'd left for my camping trip.Jay's sent it via the US Post Office with postage of $4.90 in an envelope provided free of charge by the US Post Office.I am surprized Amazon tolerates merchants who rip off Amazon customers with inflated and inferior shipping.Jay's should learn to earn their priofit from the product sale not by shameful gouging followed by lack of performance as promised."
2,"Much smaller than 3/16""","This is very thin shock-cord, not 3/16"" as advertised. More like 1/8"" or 3/32"". It might be OK for the inside of tent-poles, but not for much else."
5,As Advertised,"The shock cord is as advertised and I received it fast by ordering through Amazon Prime. It arrived in plenty of time to fix our tent pole before our Labor Day weekend camping trip. The cord is a bit smaller than the original, but it seems to be much better cord than what can with out tent. I think the price is a bit much, but all in all, a great product."
3,"product good, Amazon annoying","When will Amazon allow people to shop as a guest, without logging in?I don't want to remember a password, and I don't want Amazon to remember my credit card info. But I have to use a password to log-in (so annoying - I know my address and contact info - why should Amazon force me to remember something else to input information I already know?) And I have to actively delete my credit card info after purchases. Saving that info should be an opt-in choice, not the default."
4,"Wife loved it, highly recommend for Mothers Day or B-day","Had 21 month old bring to mommy for Mother's Day, she loved it. Only thing that could make it better is if pendant had a little more depth to it (which many other reviews had mentioned, so I was prepared for that). All of the imagaes of this pendant on the web make it appear to be more 3-D than it actually is. Overall pick this up as a gift for the wife, you can't go wrong."
5,Loving Family Necklace,"I purchased for a young couple and their child. The quality of the necklace seems to be good, but the chain is a little shorter than I expected."
3,The Box Sucks!,"The box on this item is insufficient to give as a gift. You will need to purchase a jewlery box for this.The item itself, as many have said is not as 3D. It is rough 1/4 inch wide if you lay it on its back."
5,Nice mothers day gift.,"Great gift plus a bonus. If you take a look at it in person, not just the picture, you will notice the kid has a butt crack. My wife still loves it but it is a great joke also."
3,Chain was the wrong length,"This pendant was very nice, but it came with a 16"" chain, instead of the 18"" chain that it was supposed to come with. My wife needs an 18"" chain so she had to put the pendant on a chain that she already owns. This means that I paid for a 16"" chain that she can't even wear. Other than that, she loves the pendant and it seems to be of very good quality."
5,Great necklace.,"I bought this for my wife as just a stocking stuffer 2 years ago 1 month before my first son was born. She loved it. Not only did she love it but she never takes it off. I know its cheap but its a lovely image with the parents and child, and it has proven durable as can be. The chain it came with has withstood my baby boy hanging onto it now for over 18 months and it is still going strong. Cant say enough good about the quality of this. Thanks for making a great cheap product."
1,Got something different,I was try to give this as a gift but when I got it was a different item. It had white paint on it.
4,Just as described,This was one of those finds that just puts a smile on a loved ones face and it was worth the money
2,Looks cheap,"I bought this item as a gift for my sister. When it came, I was sad to see that it looks much cheaper than I expected. The area on the 'parents' appears to have a white-ish coloration, almost as if they inlaid another material over it so that the child would contrast with the color. The packaging is just awful- cheap and thin. In fact, I had to get another box to put it in before I gave it to her. My sister still decided to return it in hopes of finding another, nicer family necklace. I do not suggest buying this product."
5,beautiful,"got as a gift for my sister, and she loves it. looked great on her and the packaging was perfect. thanks."
5,LOVED IT....,Thank you very much to everyone at Amazon I bought this as a V-Day present for my wife and she loved it Thank you again it was exactally as what was shown in pic.....
4,cute necklace. probably would be better on a shorter chain,"Very pretty necklace for a great price. Comes in a personalizable box (have area to write ""to"" and ""from"") which is a nice, if a bit cheesy, touch. The only negative is that the pendant is a bit on the large side and my wife would have preferred a smaller version. However, a shorter chain might also help since the 18"" chain may make it seem bigger since it looks weighed down a bit. Otherwise, nice product. Silver looks to be of high quality and I would recommend it for a Mother's Day or birthday present."
4,This product works !!!,"I have used this product for a long time. I mostly use it for regularity. It is the best product I have found for this. Try it, it's great .."
3,"Good Stapler, Not a Great Prop.","This is a nice working stapler. I have no complaints with it's function. But if you are buying this because you want one like Office Space, then the only thing that they really have in common is that they are red and swingline. Other than that, the prop stapler and 747 are pretty different. I also also slightly concerned about the fact that this is touted as ""Limited Edition"", yet I have never seen an edition size, and this thing has been available for years. As a movie memorabilia collector, my pet peeve is when people abuse the term ""limited edition""."
5,Have You Seen My Stapler?,"People sometimes form very strong bonds to inanimate objects. This is especially the case when you come into daily contact with, say, a red Swingline stapler. The ultimate utilitarian desktop accessory. Its vibrant red color stands out amongst the grays and beiges that consume office space. The sleek, smooth retro lines. The sheer weight. The precise, solid movement. The mechanics. The thick, dense sound as paper is conjoined...One thing is certain - you will never covet an office supply as much you will your red Swingline stapler."
4,I believe you have my stapler,"Being a fan of the movie Office Space both my husband and I laughed at the fact that we could actually order a red Swingline stapler series 747. He works in an office setting and this stapler is just one way he knows no one will take it from his desk.As a stapler the 747 is pretty straight forward, but the all metal design (minus the rubber stopper on the bottom) makes the stapler a beast. It can staple through large stacks of paper where as other plastic staplers may not have the force needed to puncture the paper.The only con was the packaging that Amazon had sent it in. The stapler was actually falling out of the ""aggression free packaging"" and had dark blue scuff marks all over it which my husband had to buff out. Other than that it was well worth a purchase."
1,DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS,"WE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR THIS STAPLER, WHEN IT FINALLY CAME, WE LOADED IT UP WITH PREMIUM STANDARD STAPLES AND TRIED IT OUT. FROM THE FIRST STAPLE TO THE LAST THE STAPLER THREW THE ENTIRE LOAD OF STAPLES OUT WITH SUCH FORCE I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. AS SOON THE TOP WAS DEPRESSED THE WHOLE LOT OF STAPLES INSIDE THE STAPLER SHOT OUT OF IT LIKE A GUN, ONCE HITTING ME IN THE FACE SO HARD I WAS STUNNED, AND HAVE A DEEP RED MARK TO PROVE IT. IT HURT LIKE CRAZY. I AM SENDING THIS STUPID DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS ITEM BACK IN THE NEXT MAIL. STAY AWAY. GOOD THING I WAS FAR ENOUGH AWAY WHEN THE STAPLES HIT ME OR I WOULD BE SENDING THE ER BILL BACK WITH IT. BEWARE, THESE PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO EVER HAVE HEARD OF ""PRODUCT LIABILITY""."
5,Cult stapler - red - Office Space,Awesome build quality. So excellent this is my 2nd one. I had to buy one for work and keep the other one for home. Anyone that knows Office Space will really appreciate this stapler.
5,Milton's Red Stapler,"Who didn't love Milton's red stapler in the movie ""Office Space""? This stapler is exquisite! Heavy duty and made very well. It was a gift to my daughter and she absolutely loves it....coworkers are all jealous and she will have to etch her name into it."
4,Yep - it works and it's fun.,"Not much more to say - it works and it's fun, but it could be better. I think if you're buying this particular model it's not necessarily for the quality, though it will suffice for sure."
1,Don't Buy,This stapler is great when it is new. Unfortunately it will eventually need to be refilled and that is where you run into problems. The staples split. The stapler jams and explodes staples all over the place.Have fun picking up staples.
3,Made In China,"Isn't everything these days? I have an older Swingline model 747 and it is well built and made in USA. Absolutely bulletproof.This newer version is made with thinner metal and screams 'cheap'. Unless you have a burning need for a red stapler with a Swingline label, pass on this one."
4,Thought it was broken... until I bought their staples,"Initially, I thought this stapler was broken. I noticed the note inside the stapler that stated that a recommended staple. Since I had staples at work, I thought I'd try those first. They didn't work and it seemed broken. Funny part is the staples (from Staples) work in every other Swingline stapler on my floor. On a whim, I ordered the SP4 staples it says are necessary. First staple broke and then it truly works perfectly (even more sheets than my last one worked for). The staples weren't too expensive (less than $4 for 5,000 staples), just an added annoyance. I would have given it 5 stars, except this wasn't clearly spelled out upon purchase of the stapler (and it still seems ridiculous to have to do it - there are tons of staples around work for free and I have to buy them). Oh well... still recommend the stapler and it is a conversation piece."
5,Not only an office conversation piece...but a quality stapler at that.,"I purchased this stapler for my cubicle purely because of the Office Space reference. However, this is actually a really top-notch stapler. While my co-workers staplers are made of a cheap plastic this one is made of metal. I've owned this stapler now for over 3 years and it has worked consistently and well. I've never had it jam up on my once. Now that I've owned a Swingline 747 series stapler I understand why Milton was so protective of his..."
2,Jammed!,"This stapler got jammed while stapling a modest 20 sheet regular printer paper stack. Did I end up getting a defective piece? Nevertheless, my experience has not been good."
2,"great office cache, poor quality","I got this b/c of the film, like so many others. I *want* to love it; I've carried it from job to job for years and proudly display it on my desk. But(!) I hardly ever use it. It tends to jam, the rubber base slips off easily, and overall it's less reliable than my other staplers. Sad, but true. Perhaps I got a lemon?"
5,Does what it says and looks like it should.,"It looks sweet and has all the abilities described. Most importantly, it effectively connects formerly separate pieces of paper. What more can you ask for? Buy it today."
2,Not as durable as it looks,"I was visually impressed by this stapler's sturdy look and feel. However, despite its heavy metal body, I barely got one year's use out of it. Moderate use in a classroom setting...within 5 months the staples started to jam frequently. Before the end of the school year, it stopped functioning all together and some sort of metal piece just literally broke off and fell out of it. Into the trash it went."
5,Nice desk ornament,"I don't use staples. I just use this thing because I get bored at work and it makes me feel like I have a better personality.I don't think it really helps personalities, so if yours sucks already, look for something else like botox."
1,Cheap materials and poor assembly,"I'd love to love my red Swingline stapler, but it fell apart after a short time because one of the main components is made of cheap plastic and the stapler was manufactured incorrectly. If you peel back the rubber base and look inside at the pivot end of the stapler, you will see a little black plastic bar that goes across the width of the base. That piece holds the two halves of the stapler together, and it is peened in place to avoid loosening. Unfortunately, the peening on my stapler was inferior, and that combined with the weakness of the plastic caused the piece to come off rendering the stapler useless. Swingline used to be a quality product, but this thing is a cheap, poorly made POS."
2,Picture is misleading,"I have purchased countless items on Amazon over the years but this is the first and only item that I've ever returned. The shade of red on the top of the stapler is a completely different color than that on the base. The plastic top was the bright fire engine red that I expected while the metal base was a deeper, darker red. This was not evident on any of the pictures shown here when I bought it so I was disappointed to see it when it arrived. Since I was bought the stapler purely for aesthetics this was totally unacceptable to me and I returned it.The overall construction and plastic Swingline badge on the top looked cheap next to the black Swingline I rely on every day, but overall it looks like a serviceable stapler. I did not try it out at all because I wanted to return it in mint condition so I can't speak to its functionality, but when you buy a product for the color, you expect it to be consistent."
3,I've always wanted a RED Swingline...,"It's a red Swingline, what more can I say?I am however disappointed that it already had some scuffed areas that are black along the back of it. Looks like it was scraped with something. But due to the hassle of returning items from amazon, and the fact that I need a stapler now...I'll just keep it. Other than that, it's great....just deducted 2 stars for the scratches."
5,Great Stapler & Good For Laughs,"The stapler itself is pretty well built. Nice and solid. Works really well.Its also a great stapler because its hard to find a red swingline and its funny to find out who really gets the fact that you have a red swingline. Its a good conversation starter. You'd be surprised though how many people reall dont get why its such a big deal that you have a red swingline, sucks to be them. But just be careful though your co-workers might try to steal your red swingline when you're not looking."
5,Stapler review,"I ordered this staple for a friend. She loved the movie Office Space and this stapler was a very funny part of the movie. If you haven't seen it yet, please check it out. If you think Dilbert is funny, you will love Office Space."
2,Plastic pivot joint broken - rarely used,"I was stapling papers on the wall gently when the plastic pivot piece inside the stapler broke. My beautiful red stapler is broken and unfortunately I will need to buy another. Two stars for loving the color and it's functionality while it lasted. ""Maltboy"" described the problem well. I had the stapler for 1 year."
5,Great product.,"I have to admit I solely based my decision to purchase this stapler because of the movie Office Space. Come to find out, It is the actually the best stapler I have ever used. This stapler is solid and seems extremely well built, it will last a lifetime. Great stapler and definitely a conversation piece. I would recommend to a friend."
5,Swingline 747 Rio Red Business Stapler,"I bought this because I needed a stapler for my home office, and because I liked the movie ""Office Space.""What I got was a GREAT stapler. I've grown accustomed to staplers jamming up every now and again, but not this one.It's got some heft, and feels great in your hand. This is how everything should be made.You won't find a better stapler."
5,Excellent,"Very nice Stapler , good weight to it , does the job it's supposed to , excellent price also"
5,"Attractive, high quality, made in China stapler","This stapler, even though it's made in China, feels high quality. It has a good rubber base and feels like it has a very good build quality because of the weight and ""operational smoothness"". I also like the red color. I don't think you could get a much better manual stapler. Highly recommended. NOTE: Does not come with staples."
5,"Bold, heavy, easy to find on messy desk - priceless!","Nice, hefty weight - great fireman red - so easy to find on a messy desk. Great value for the price! ***UPDATE**** Still working fine - and it is SOOO easy to find on a desk. Good unique present for someone in an office setting."
5,Um... I believe I have the most killer stapler ever.,"This is on my desk and not only is it a heavy, metal stapler that works perfectly, every single time, it's got mad notoriety for being straight out of Office Space. People love it at my work. :)"
5,Perfect to staple those TPS reports!,"I received this as a present from my co-workers, who snicker along with me on every group cake moment and Hawaiian shirt day. If you aren't sure what this means, first you need to go buy a copy of ""Office Space"", a little cult classic for those of us in the corporate cubicle set.Now, for those of you who really wanted a review on the stapler itself....seriously the best stapler I have ever had. Three years running and this little baby has not jammed once....not one time. It handles a good stack of paper, is a nice heavy design (not like the inferior ones you normally get at your desk)and also has never come up missing due to the very bright red color :)If you would like to make a cubicle dweller's day, this would do it. If they are a fan of Office Space, they will not only appreciate it but it will bring a smile to their face with every tps report that they staple."
5,"Red Swingline, Fast delivery!",I can see why Mort loved his Red Swingline. It's a TPS Report thing - you wouldn't understand.
3,"Luv it, but one problem","Love the classic red Swingline stapler...but having one problem. The rubber bottom does not want to stay on. A drop of glue should help, but somewhat disappointing...."
1,dangerus?????????,"i wus trying to stapil my papr and then booM??it wont work after 5 time staple and when i try to make it work my fingr start bleeding,,,,,,,waste of money cant believ this."
5,Solid Stapler,Stapler is full metal which feels pretty durable and comes in a very nice red. It has a rubber grip on the base which is nice. Stapler does NOT come with staples so be sure to pick up order some with it.
5,If they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire...,"And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting, I'm going to quit.And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married, but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire..."
1,broken item.. never worked ... stuck staples. horrible,"broken item.. never worked ... stuck staples, spring broke and quite expensive for a stapler. horrible. and was too complicated to return..tried to contact company but info was not available"
4,"Funny, but doesn't seem sturdy","And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were married, but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire..."
3,"THE red stapler, almost.","I was excited when I got this as a gift since I love Office Space. But the more I looked at it, the more I began thinking that something doesn't look right. I found some screen captures from the movie and figured out why. They are two very different staplers. Two noticeable differences are the metal plate on top with the Swingline name and the color. Maybe it's this flourescent lighting but this stapler looks more of a red-orange. Overall, this is a good Swingline stapler that's painted red (or red-orange) but it's not Milton's Red Stapler."
4,My red stapler,The stapler is great! It was bought as a collectors item to simple satisfy the 'Its MY red stapler' need from Office Space *smile*Thanks
5,Well made and pretty.,"Aside from always having admired the stapler in the movie ""Office Space,"" I needed a decent one for work. The ones we are issued constantly jam. This red Swingline stapler doesn't disappoint. It's a well-made, substantial stapler...big bonus--it's pretty too! I make sure I hide mine at work because I don't want to tempt anyone to walk away with my red beauty!"
4,Best stapler ever!,"I bought this stapler as a gift for my wife because of the movie, but when I got the stapler I was amazed at the super high quality. I was reserved about buying due to it's high price, but I will buy another one shortly for my self."
5,better than your average stapler,This stapler is heavier and really is better than any other stapler I have used.
5,A Must-Have,"I was attracted to this staple for its obvious connection to Office Space and the Milton character (""I believe you have my stapler.""), but was happy to find that the stapler itself is of great quality, too, especially with the right staples (definitely follow the recommended staples to buy that this product suggests, they know what they are talking about). It's sleek, functional, and a brilliant red - it was the perfect addition to my office."
3,"A good stapler, but not great","I am happy with this stapler in the sense that it fulfills my Office Space fantasies. I am unhappy that it did not include any staples in the package, like the label said it did. The quality of the red coating also is not very good. On the edges there is some of the black undercoating showing through.Other than as a novelty, I would not order this product again."
5,Real Life Milton,"I absolutely had to pick up this stapler after finding it on amazon. There used to be a real life female version of Milton in my office, who reminded me of Milton even before she sent out the following classic email, aptly titled ""stapler"":""Did you borrow my stapler on Monday evening? If so, please return it.""Obviously, me and my co-workers almost died laughing. If she was still with us I would have bought her one of these shiny red ones. To this day nobody knows if she ever found her company issued Swingline, but our office building is still standing."
5,"I couldn't resist. Solid, Collectible Stapler for my Office Space","While looking for a stapler, I came across this beauty. ""Office Space""Office Space 11 x 17 Movie Posteris such a great movie and one of my all time favorites. The Milton character is classic - ""he took my stapler and he never brought it back.."" and the Red Swingline becomes a collectors item!It's also a good, solid, heavy and beautiful red stapler at a reasonable price. I also love the metal label on top. Almost exactly like Milton's!"
2,Crud,I can't believe I paid over $10 for a stapler that didn't last 6 months.I have some seriously cheap no-name staplers kicking around that are 10 years old and they still work.
1,Junk,"Poorly made. After each single use I have to pull it apart as if I'm adding staples, because the tolerances are too tight or the spring isn't powerful enough. One staple, pull apart, one staple, pull apart...gets old. Yes, I purchased the staples Swingline recommends (Swingline brand, of course)."
5,Office Space Red,"Purchased for an ""Office Space"" junkie. A red stapler made by Swingline. You can actually staple stuff while watching ""Office Space"". Is this a great country or what?"
4,We need to talk about your TPS reports,"Purchased this stapler for my office, as (like many other companies) was starting to mirror office space. Though not identical to Milton's stapler, this stapler is comfortable and works well if you're like me with oversized hands."
5,Outstanding,"The sheer quality of the BPO orchestral playing makes this recording a very important addition to the catalogue, especially when rival versions from Bernstein, Salonen, Rattle and Litton offer nothing of the sort. Even Haitink with the BPO falls short of the super virtuoso performance Abbado gets from the same orchestra, and it is ironic that Abbado's only serious rival among modern recordings is himself, with the equally great Vienna Philharmonic.Do get this recording, it won't be surpassed in the near future."
4,Very good but not truly great,"The interpretation is sensitive and well judged, and the orchestral playing in this live performance is full of both virtuosity and tonal beauty (as one might expect from the Berlin Phil). However, having offered up these praises, I nevertheless find that Abbado in the last analysis fails to quite convey both the raw dramatic power and visionary intensity that the Horenstein and Bernstein-Sony recordings do, each in their distinctive ways.Furthermore, the sound, though of good bass extension and dynamic range, tends to drop out in the quiet passages.If you do not have a recording of the Mahler 3rd, I would advise you to start with the aforementioned Bernstein because, in addition to the quality of the performance, it has valuable fillers consisting of fine performances of the Kindertotenlieder and three of the Ruckert songs (most other recordings of this piece do not offer anything else), it is mid-priced, and the Horenstein is no longer domestically available."
4,Good and tense...,"If you like your Mahler robust and heavy, seething with Romanticism, but up to a point, then you should try this recording. The solo passages for the various instruments in the orchestra are virtuoustic and the tempi are meditative but do not drag. It's a tight, taut recording with a live precence, and edge and a bite to it. A worthy tribute to Abaddo's Berlin Philharmonic. For a 'heavier' recording try Bernstein's set with New York, for something lighter, more 'dancy' try Haitink with Amersterdam."
4,Romantic but not brazen,"The opening to this disc is very disappointing - the horns are sombre, not fiery - but things do improve. Some beautiful playing and lots of nice touches. The principal horn redeems himself with some of the finest horn solos to be heard on CD. In generatl it is tidier and prettier than the Bernstein/NYP recording, but I'd still choose Bernstein's rawness and fire which is what this piece is really about for me."
5,what a babe,"This Eve sounds like one hot babe. She is passionate, smart, funny and very human. She also is a good friend to the men and women in her life. I like loyalty and I loved this book."
4,No regrets,"Not long ago I saw this book at Barnes and Noble in their DISCOVER GREAT NEW AUTHORS section, but I thought I would wait for the paperback. Then when I logged on and read all the positive reviews both from customers and the media on this site, I broke down and bought it for the full fifteen bucks. Well - my buyer's remorse faded within ten pages.... I got my money's worth...Laughed, cried, and was sorry to see the final chapter end."
3,What was the point?,"I'll give this book some credit: Some parts were funny, others were sad, and I'm sure some bride-to-be out there can relate. However, I thought, ""Geez, woman! Get a grip! You're getting married, not executed! Get over your whiny self!"" This book was actually depressing to read. I finished it because it wasn't horrible, but three stars is all it really deserves. Actually, 2 1/2 stars, but there isn't a selection for that. If this book was any longer than 209 pages, I probably would've had to force myself to the end. If you are engaged and really excited and optimistic about it, please don't read this book."
2,not a very nice book,"I still can't figure out why this book is being lumped in with the ""Bridget Jones"" kind of women writers...this woman is negative, unpleasant, and boring. Sure, Bridget Jones is occasionally both negative and unpleasant, but at least she was never boring. which is exactly what this woman was. Nice combination, eh?When I finished this book, I felt like I had just gotten off a year-long phone call with one of those friends who never has anything positive to say but wants to give you a detailed catalog of her life's miseries from the moment of her conception to the minute before she picked up the phone to call you. I have enough people in my life like this...I certainly didn't need to read a book about someone like this, too."
2,A waste of time,This book gave me a headache. It jumps around and the thoughts the author conveys are incomplete and at times make no sense. I kept reading because of all the good reviews and hoped it would get better. In the end it was a huge let down.
1,Do I have to?,"The two phrases in the book that sum it all up are: ""maybe we should get engaged"", (he seems to mumble it as if it were a hateful chore like ""maybe we should go to the supermarket"") and ""do I have to do it now?"" which to me would be all a guy would have to say before I would know the relationship was doomed. The character of this book, though, takes what she can get and runs with it. She then starts her plans for a wedding that begins a nauseating journey of grumbling and moaning until the ""big"" day. No thank you."
5,Scary... it reminds me alot of my engagement...,"This book describes all the emotions that runs rampant through someones mind when they are faced with the impending hell of nuptual bliss. From the receiving of the ""rock"" to the walk down the aisle, you will not want to put this book down.I await Suzanne Finnamore's next novel."
4,Entertaining And Funny,"This was a good, quick read. There were some definite laugh out loud parts, and parts that every woman could relate to. The only disappointment was that this couple did not seem like the best match, or as if they were getting married for the right reasons. The main character is not the most likeable or stable person in many instances, and she is a bit manipulative. While this is a great read for those who are engaged or recently married. You will definitely get some good laughs and will relate with at least parts of the book. For example -- socks on the floor are not just socks on the floor, they are socks on the floor for the rest of your life!"
3,If this is reality- I should be a divorce attorney,"Although I really thought this book was funny- My reccomendation to anyone reading it is- THIS IS NOT REAL LIFE. At least I hope not. I am in the process of getting married, and I am experiencing none of this.I think that if all women went through these feelings getting married, there would be an awful lot of divorces.Regardless of my feelings on the engagement process, I found the book laugh out loud funny. It made me glad to be me, and glad that all of this stuff was happening to someone else!Enjoy it for what it is- a light weight read."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book terribly disappointing. The character was unlikable and unbelievable. The story goes nowhere, there is no plot. I had to force myself to read it. I really enjoyed Bridget Jones Diary, and this doesn't even come close."
1,I would give it a 1/2 star if i could,"This was a trite, unfunny, self-absorbing book. I found the characters unlikeable, the theme ridiculous, and the writing choppy and boring. Bridget Jones is so much more witty! Don't waste your time or dollars. I gave away my copy after reading the first 30 pages.PS I agree, eve is more annoying than the characters in Ya-Ya Sisterhood!"
2,A little darker than the reviews would suggest,"I enjoyed the author's writing style and think she's clever, but the story is much darker than the reviews and book jacket led me to believe. I found it depressing that Eve repeatedly removed her engagement ring and handed it back to her fiance, declaring she wasn't going to marry him. I think these tactics are manipulative and cowardly, and because of this, I wasn't as happy with the book as I thought I would be. I hope this isn't how women really are with their fiances. However, I do think Ms. Finnamore does have a strong writing style that I would like to see again."
2,Boring until last 30 pages,"I found that I could have put this book down at any time and wouldn't have cared about finishing it. The plot was uninteresting, and the author's writing style was even worse. She would jump around between the past and present in a confusing way. The story was uninspiring. Eve is getting married and the entire book is about her having second thoughts. Being engaged myself, I could not relate to this character at all. The only way you will like this book is if you are engaged and have incredibly cold feet."
2,"Liked it? . . Sorta, but not really.","Rapier wit and memorable one-liners all served quick and steaming from the politically correct kitchen of Susanne Finnamore. I've never read a book that made me want to both laugh and barf from paragraph to paragraph. The marital anxiety, coupled with the jealousy of Micheal's past girlfriends, is funny stuff. But the ""fillers"" i.e. the subplots, are simply rehashed leftist blather, an over-obvious attempt to be hip, ""so San Franciso."" Her religious relative is, of course, a drunk; the gay friend is, of course, dying of AIDS; and the discerning reader will, of course, smell the agenda. I give it 5 stars for wit, but a no-star for parading all that political correctness across the fictional stage. It wasn't needed. Hope this helps.ps: Susanne, there really is something else up there besides a xxxxing chariot.."
2,Covert Art Misleadingly GIRLIE -- Needs Blood & Wedding Cake,"Imagine eating a really rich, creamy custard. Now imagine gorging yourself on a ginormous mountain of eggy, milky goop as fast you can. That's what this book is like. It is HI-larious and whiny from the start, but it just becomes too much, and then you put down the book and marf up your lunch because you just want her to mellow out, shut up, and do something else."
3,otherwise ordinary,"In my honest opinion I don't think the book is worth purchasing. It's readable but kind of bland. I must admit I was disappointed because it seemed ordinary. I'm not sure why I had such high expecations for this book. Perhaps I could not relate to this book because the main character was middle aged. Her age explains her feelings and emotions during her engagement. However, I wouldn't recommend this book for twenty somethings..."
2,Fast read--but not that enjoyable,"I do admit, the book is well written. It's fast and easy to read, but its also irritating. The characters in the book are whiny and unsympathetic. The book pretends to be based in reality only to be unrealistic in character and situation. If you get involved in the books you read as much as I do, you will find this book grating instead of pleasurable."
2,Don't Judge This Book By Its Cover,"I thought at first -- wrongly -- that this book would essentially be ""Bridget Jones Gets Engaged"". However, stepping into the shoes of Ms. Jones is a negatively neurotic woman who thinks about almost anything but being happily engaged. I thought I might read about her comic adventures in everything related to being engaged (picking DJs, a place for the reception, deciding the guest list, etc. etc.). Instead, the ""heroine"" broods about all of her relationships (fiance and otherwise) throughout. Unless you're miserable and want some company, skip on to another book and save those precious, irretrievable hours of your life for something more enjoyable.""Those who can, do. Those who can't, criticize."""
2,Blah,"I'm sure this book is really ""true to life"" or whatever, but the couple both come off as such selfish jerks, it was hard for me to see why anyone would want to marry either of them."
1,Boring,I only made it through the 1st half of the book. Didn't keep my interest at all. Too much talk about the character's job and not the engagement/wedding.
4,"Well written, although somewhat depressing..","Eve has reached the pinnacle of success that she has thought she might never see - her boyfriend has agreed to an engagement. She thought that the hardest part would be getting to this point, but what with all the anxiety and worries, she realizes that what came before was merely child's play. This is the story of her journey to the wedding date.I would have to agree with the reviewer that stated that while she enjoyed the book, she would not recommend it. That sums up my feelings exactly, even while reading! At times I had to force myself to pick it up, as the tone of the novel follows a somewhat depressing theme. There are some highlights and pearls of wisdom, and for that reason, I would recommend this book if it is a gift or someone you know well has a copy lying around. Otherwise, forget it."
4,nice book,I was able to relate to some of the main character's issues since I'm engaged myself. I also work in San Francisco where the story line takes place. Overall it was a good book.
1,Funny?,I only got halfway through before I decided that if it was going to be funny I would have laughed by then. I found it flatly depressing.
5,One of the best..,I loved it! I laughed out loud many a time...and yes... women think like this...at least the women I know...and also myself...it was like listening to me...and my friends...I recommended it to all my friends...and I was so sorry to see it end...If I could be an author...I would wish that I could write like this!!
3,"I enjoyed it, but won't recommend it.","I enjoyed this book, although I found the character to be very cynical and therefore, sometimes hard to relate to. She was all over the place and someone who I'm very glad to be able to say I'm not. I laughed a lot throughout this book, but I felt sorry for her too.But, at the end of it all, I enjoyed the book and found it a fun, light read. But, I won't recommend it. It is not as good as other books within this genre and I can't think of anyone I know who would enjoy it (except perhaps my best friend). So, with that in mind, I'd tell a potential reader to move on and find something else - unless of course you find it in your hands and you're sitting on the beach!"
2,Couldn't even finish it....,"I have never NOT finished a book - it took everything I had just to get to the middle, in hopes that it would get better. It didn't. Eve annoyed me and so did Michael. I would hate to know either of them! If I ever had a relationship like that I never would have gotten married!!"
1,Trite and boring,"Do yourself a favor: check this one out from the library. It's badly written and Eve is too shallow to spend five minutes with, much less several hours."
3,"Cute, but not what it's hyped up to be","This is a cute, fun book--which was what I'd expected it to be--BUT, not cute or fun ENOUGH, given the hype. It has very funny moments, but loses steam. Finnamore succeeds at creating a very ""real"" universe stocked with characters that are admirably 3-dimensional. All that said, it didn't have quite enough ""punch""; the story lost momentum after a great first 60 pages. If I'm being too critical, it's because I was misled to believe that _Otherwise Engaged_ was a cross between Jane Austen and Bridget Jones, which it's not."
2,Funny in a strained way; she's no Bridget Jones,"I loved ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" so I rushed to read this when people made comparisons. While it is funny in parts, Eve comes off as wracked with needless nerves and slightly whiny. Bridget was self-deprecating - Eve is self-indulgent. Ultimately this reads like a sitcom - one that wouldn't be renewed for a second season."
2,"Whiny, immature, annoying","I could not believe how Eve, the main character, behaved in this book. I'm 27 and not married, but I know enough about men to know that this is not the way to get one to marry you! She picks ridiculous childish fights with Michael, and he says horrible things to her (during one argument he calls her the ""c"" word... unforgivable!) I would not WANT to marry a man if I had to give him an ultimatum, and I really wouldn't want to marry a man who came back and sort of mumbled ""well, I guess we should get engaged..."" What self-respecting woman would?Still, there are some very funny parts in the book. At one point, Eve wonders (duh...) if it isn't all his fault... ""Mama's making the shake and bake, but I'm helping"" I actually read that one out loud to a friend. There are a few other moments like that in the book, but overall I just wanted to shake Eve and say ""This is not how it's done!"""
5,Funny!,"I bought the audio cassette version of this book after seeing an article in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY where they gave it an ""A"" grade - I was skeptical (The Terminator reads Wedding Story?) but soon gave over to laughter -- listened to it on a long car trip and the miles flew by. This book is hilarious."
3,Love and marriage in the nineties in the advertising world,"This book really hit the spot with me. My sister is getting married and both she and her fiance are in the advertising business, like the main characters. This novel is poignant and funny and sad and therefore true to life all at the same time. A very easy read that you will enjoy."
2,Interesting but a hard read.,"I found the writing style of the author hard to read. She jumps around too much and it's hard to follow. Seems to be written in a diary-like format; too choppy for that. Contents of the book is interesting, hard to keep with it because of the writing style."
1,Not too good,"It's too bad. I was hoping to enjoy this book, but I didn't find this character funny at all. There was nothing interesting about the story. I usually enjoy reading diary-type books, but the events that lead up to this man and woman's marriage seemed inappropriate. The kind of fighting that they did during their engagement seemed to be a bit rough, and turned me off."
1,Bad,"This book was a bad illustration that women have such a lack of self esteem lately that they will trap a mate, even if that person is not right for them. This made for depressing reading. Nothing much good to say about this story, or the writing style, for that matter."
2,Waste of paper,"I'm glad that I waited until paperback to buy this ridiculous ""wedding"" book. This is a woman who inevitably sees the glass as ""half empty"" and will never be satisfied with anything or any one. The picture I got of the main character was one of a jealous and unattractive woman, someone who would be lucky to even get a date let alone get a husband.The comedy in this book was laced with self-hate and other displays of inadequacy that made me feel sorry for the main character, as opposed to cheering them on in the end.As women, we have matured past the point of reading books like this."
5,Most enthralling book I have read in ages!!!!!!,"At age 31 I became engaged and married at 32 and am now having my 2nd child. My aunt sent me Otherwise Engaged and I laughed, cried and just loved every word. I feel almost like Suzanne Finnamore and I have lead parallel lives, except that I could never have found that warm, witty, sarcastic and ENGAGING way to recount my experience! This book is a treasure and my aunt also sent me Zygote Chronicles which I am about to jump into and cannot wait.Thank you Suzanne Finnamore!!"
3,Entertaining but somewhat lacking,"I read this book over the course of spring break, which included a 2 23-hour drives, so I had a lot of down time. This book was great entertainment for that kind of situation; however, I couldn't help but want more from the book. The author is obviously witty and she has a wonderful plot with which to work. Yet, I didn't feel like the book ultimately delivered. The internal explanations for the characters' behavior didn't always jive to me, and there were times when I thought the book lost all common sense. Bottom line: a great beach read but it could be much better."
5,This one well worth your time it's a gem of a book!,"I had to give this one 5 Stars. I could find nothing wrong with it. It was very enjoyable to read and really quite funny . Some of the things the character was feeling and saying I could even relate too and I'm not ""engaged"" and have been married many, many years. It was fun and when I turned the last page I didn't want it to end. I sure hope she follows up with a sequel or with anything. This writer has a gift."
3,Otherwise Engaged,"A great book to read while planning your own wedding. You don't neccessarily fall in love with this couple, but you will like them. I imagine their relationship may be realistic to some, although the fairy-tale lover in me would want more than they have. I do have to say the book brought out emotion in me at the end, so it must not have been that bad."
2,Disappointing and depressing,"As someone engaged myself, I was looking forward to reading about someone *else's* planning misery! Unfortunately, that's what this book was about: misery. I found this book to be more of a downer than anything else - not just the usual butterflies about marriage, more like a closet full of moths."
3,Borrow it from the Library... but don't waste your money,"I generally read reviews of a book before picking it up... and this one rated pretty high among readers. However, when I actually sat down to read it, I have to say I was disappointed. Although some of the book may ring true for people who are engaged, for the rest of us just looking for a good read will walk away very unfulfilled. Half of the book you want to reach through and slap the main character into reality, the other half you are bored and are counting how many more pages until the end.Not terrible... just don't expect too much."
4,more biting than I thought,"I enjoyed reading this book, but it was different than I expected. From the positive reviews I thought it would be a laugh-out-loud spoof of the zaniness of engagement, maybe along the lines of Erma Bombeck. Instead, it was a cynical, wry type of humor -- which is still good, I'm just telling you to be prepared. Also, there are some really dark moments, it's not all comedy. But it's well-written and a fast read, a good beach or airplane book."
1,Gives women a bad name,"An interesting premise--to write about a year-long engagement--but did the heroine have to be so hideous? I felt sorry for the man she was marrying. After all the weddings I've been party to, I don't remember one bride being this bad (and I've dealt with some kooks). I can't imagine another 36-year-old on this planet behaving in such a 21-year-old fashion. Many reviews out there are saying this book is as good a read as Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank. Save your money!! Bank's book identifies with single women FAR better than this one!"
4,feet first,"i got engaged at 27, and i never wavered during the eighteen months before the wedding. At that age, I didn't think about the ""rest of my life,"" I just forged ahead, blindly (a character in this book says, of her own marriage, ""For me, I did it by not looking at it""). Finnamore tells the story of a woman who is engaged at 36. She can't stop looking at it. The reasons to marry blur, and she can't be happy, not for a second, about forging ahead. In fact, she equates marriage with death. This is the difference between engagement at 27 and 36. Those 9 years of singlehood, her extra baggage, the extra baggage of her older groom, all add up to confusion, doubt and sadness-but funny, too, since this is funneled throught a cynical, snappy narrator. This book a confirmation of marriage, none the less. No matter how hard it is to do it, we'll do it anyway."
5,A layered Wedding Story,"I think a lot of people are missing the true core of this book. This is a multilayered book- like a spiral it starts with great humor and slowly you find yourself still laughing but crying too. This is a woman who has earned her position, nothing was given to her and yet through pain and a compassionate spirit she triumphs. It is not what it may appear at first - a delightful fluffy read - it has substance and bravely explores all the fears and agony of loving unconditionally. A brave and complete testament to a gutsy woman's year of engagement."
2,PASS,"I wanted to give this book a try because I'm getting married in a few months and thought it would be interesting. With the different things I heard I wasn't sure. I didn't finish it, though, and will tend to agree that the book is no fun. Not that I was expecting a ""fairy tale"" type of romance, but this couple didn't even seem to LIKE each other. At least he didn't seem to like her very much.Ususally I also give first time writers the benefit of the doubt, and since it's a subject matter I am obviously interested in, I tried. I would not recommend this to someone who is in love and planning to be married."
2,"Disheartening, bitter, mediocre, narrative","Michael and Eve have been living together and now they're engaged due to Eve's ultimatum. Eve is 36 years old and has never been married. Michael has been married before and has a daughter Phoebe. He is reluctant to make a commitment despite Eve's best efforts. Every action and behavior has a motive for Eve regarding Michael. Now that she's got a ring; as she says ""just add diamonds, instant-shrew"". Every time they have an argument she's quick to take off her ring. Too much is made of her subscription to Bride magazine. I had a hard time finding any empathy for Eve. You hardly hear or see Michael. It had its moments but overall I was not impressed."
5,Otherwise Engaged -- A fun read.,Any unmarried or recently engaged woman hearing the cruel & constant drumbeat of her biological clock will relate to this wickedly funny and neurotic tale of an engagement. Eve's transition from live-in girl friend to second wife and the hell that breaks loose in between kept me up late laughing! Otherwise Engaged is a fun and hilarious read.
2,Nothing funny about it...,"Okay maybe I a lying, there was one funny part where some characters talk about their sleeping habits, but otherwise this book was not entertaining. I picked it up thinking it was going to be a light-hearted, fun novel, and it was not. It was depressing and annoying. I really did not like the main character and everytime she took her engagement ring because they had a fight, I wanted to scream. I guess this book was just not what I expected, I only finished it because I can't stop books in the middle. On a good note it is a quick read, even if it is like torture."
1,Stop now before it's too late!,"I had such high hopes for this book, perhaps that was part of the problem, or perhaps because I'd just finished reading a few by Marian Keyes for whom humor comes so effortlessly.Whatever the problem the book was terribly disappointing. The one character one theme got old very quickly and towards the end I just wanted to beg the main character to get married or hurry up and die, incidentally if the main character had died I wouldn't have cared, never a good sign.The book certainly could have been enjoyable but so much of the humor seemed to forced and none of the characters were likeable enough and I really, really wanted to like them.Skip this one and get anything by Marian Keyes instead."
2,People in a Bad Relationship Want to Get Married,I almost bought this for my best friend that is engaged. I thought it would be about the funny events that happen before a wedding. I'm so glad I didn't send it to her! The couple in this book are horribly mis-matched and should not be getting married. I thought their whole relationship was sad...not funny.
1,"Sapre yourself--buy ""Bridget Jones"" instead","I take back everything I said about Sidda Walker from ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" being the most annoyingly self-absorbed protagonist ever created.There's nothing funny or endearing about Eve, a hot-shot yuppie ad exec whose favorite activities seem to be whining and popping Valium. Michael, her fiance, isn't exactly a prize, himself. Neither one of them evoked any sympathy; they were on my nerves not 20 pages into the book.I'll give Suzanne Finnamore credit for coining a clever phrase here and there, but she pushed the sarcasm and dark, edgy humor way too far. That and her choppy writing made ""Otherwise Engaged"" very tiring.For something truly funny, check out ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" instead."
5,Funniest book I've read in a long time,"I read this on my honeymoon and have not laughed out loud so much reading book -- my poor husband felt incredibly left out, but even he laughed at some of the passages. An absolute must for any bride to be or newly married woman -- it puts things so perfectly and hilariously in perspective."
2,Okay,"I didn't like the tone of this book. It was hostile and aggressive, and was annoying to me. Not that every wedding is full of happiness and romance, but this was a bit much for me."
4,Enjoyable but tended to be a little too long,"This book was funny in parts and somewhat enjoyable for the first 100 or so pages. Then I lost interest. I am not sure if I just got bored with all the pre-wedding trauma, but I did skip to the last chapter and read that. Ms.Finnamore presents a very identifable character for us 35+ set, who have not made the wedding trip. I laughed so hard during many passages, and could have sworn she was reading my mind! I hope she writes another book!"
1,Too whiney for me,"This book was too whiney and the girl was too much of a princess for me to have any feelings for her one way or the other. It's not uncommon in the world today to meet and marry your mate later in life. I didn't feel that she had met her match, though, in this book. I felt that she grabbed the first good-looking victim she could find. Boo."
1,Yucky,"This is a self indulgent, sloppily written book about a woman who is desperate, sad and pathetic. True love does exist, and weddings are not filled with insults, ring throwing and male bashing. Easy read, difficult to digest."
1,Falls flailingly short....,"When I first chose this book from the shelves of my local bookstore, I was hopeful that I would finally find someone that I could identify with. The lead character initially captured my heart, but managed to somehow degrade herself into a weak, selfish, characterless excuse for today's strong, self-sufficient woman. Sure, she got the man she always wanted, but did so by such trite and tactless means that it troubles me still. If, however, I had to say that I received some portion of a benefit, it would be that I realized what type of woman I will not be in the future. I may be 31 and still unmarried, but I will find my man by my own strengths and not at the expense of my own dignity."
1,How's that again?,"I was brought up in a household that carried the idea that being single was not a disease. As any other well-educated, independant woman will agree that this book is an insult for the rest of us.I would rather read a depressing novel about any woman that died alone rather than marry someone just to get that ring on her finger. This single-phobia has to end."
2,Disappointed...,"I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. It seemed to have so much promise! The main character was completely unlikable- she made me NEVER want to get married! She is the epitome of a woman who is willing to settle simply to be married. She seems to view her fiancé as a decent catch, but not as something she is madly in love with.In addition, I strongly disliked the author's writing style. I can't put my finger on it, but it just felt rough and forced, like nothing flowed smoothly. Choppy I suppose. Perhaps this appeals to some, but I found it hard to read. As someone stated in an earlier review, I also can't stop reading in the middle of a book or I would have stopped. It was that bad.Read at your own risk."
2,otherwise unengaging,"This book couldn't have been THAT bad because I read the entire thing. But the main character is kind of sickening. She spends half the book feeling sorry for herself and the other half doing things that make it impossible for the reader to feel sorry for her because she brings most of them upon herself. Unfortunately, the book sounds very autobiographical, which gives you the feeling this is based on how a real person thinks and feels and is not just a figment of someone's incredible imagination. This makes it all the MORE annoying.HOWEVER--the book is extremely well written---beautifully crafted and full of fresh, sharp images. I almost think it would have been better as a nice, short poem. The author could have clustered all the beautiful metaphors onto a page or two and spared the reader the agony of pages and pages of explicit self-pity."
3,Not quite what I expected....,"I read this book while in the middle of planning my own wedding. I thought it would be something I could relate to, based on what I read on the back cover. It's wasn't quite what I expected and left me feeling a little short-changed. I had expected alot more from this book."
5,Great deal and great birthday gifts,Great price for both movies and they made excellent birthday gifts!
2,Dissapointing at best,"Tibor Fischer is known for his inventive narratives and his off-the-wall characters and situations. This book has neither. Instead, we get a dull story interspersed with ""tall tales"" that make little sense, aren't very interesting and ultimately distract the reader from the protagonist.Having loved Tibor's previous efforts, I came away from Voyage to the End of the Room extremely dissapointed. This is a book that fails to stand out in any way and is more of a boring, Hollywood rendition of the subjects covered than anything else.What was meant to be some sort of inciteful personal journey turns out to be a dull, meandering exploration of how a man would like to think a woman thinks and acts."
2,Disappointing,"The author's flailing attempt at globetrotting hipness (with the twist of the protagonist barely leaving her couch) falls flat. The occasional wittiness and humor in parts saved this book from a one star rating. It is indeed very funny in parts, but most of it I yawned through. And the ending... it just sortof ends."
1,written by a woman?,"This novel is written in first person by a young woman, but reads so exactly like a male fantasy of what a young woman's life might be like that it was impossible to believe any of the the characters. Many male writers climb into women's skin just fine; in this book basic female perception is nonexistent. I gather the writer was getting a kick out of imagining he was a beautiful stripper, with the proverbial heart of gold; but the book read like nothing much more than an unimaginative male fantasy.Dissapointingly shallow, and tedious in its attempts at globetrotting hipness.Along a similar vein, I recently read London Irish, young groovies in London, which was absolutely hilarious."
1,timing belt kit,"The timing belt was the wrong one for my vehicle, the rest of the components worked. However I was unable to return it because once the seal on package is broken can't return."
3,"Satisfactory, I guess...","I used this book as a text for my summer school Latin American Studies class. For high school kids, and for a 3-week course, it's a satisfactory cursory look over Latin American history. It breaks everything down into thematic chronology, giving each epoch of history some sort of label: ""Post-Colonial Blues,"" ""Neo-Imperialism,"" etc.My only real complaint about the book is that the narrative tends to diverge on a consistent basis, as if someone was telling you a story, gets caught up in an aside, and then suddenly remembers that they were talking to you about something else. Also, the information seems somewhat mashed together, with little explanation of who the people he is talking about are, and why they are important.An interesting read, but there are better books on the subject out there. I recommend Marshall C. Eakin's ""The History of Latin America: Collision of Cultures"" instead."
2,Not what I expected.,"Upon first learning of the book I thought I would enjoy this read. Perhaps I expected too much, but it was a letdown in my opinion. I did not enjoy this book because it seemed too broad. I understand that the author is trying to put all of Latin America in one book but I believe he falls short in all parts of it.I did find it as a decent place to start, but it was not much better nor more informative than simply learning about Latin American Hisitory [...]. Over all i would recommend this book for middleschool or highschool students interested in learning Latin American History; any other readers might be dissapointed with the read."
3,"Decent record, but a bit lacking","I was first exposed to For Against a while back when I heard their album ""December."" I was really blown away at the melancholy, isolated feel to the record. I found ""Mason's California"" in a used bin at a record store a few years later and got ecstatic. I put it in the player and was disappointed. I figured maybe my tastes had changed and that maybe I just didn't care for that style of pop. Just recently I bought ""December."" It wasn't that I stopped liking For Against, it's just that ""December"" is that much better. ""Mason's California Lunchroom"" seems less inspired, far less moody and brooding. Lyrically it seems a bit more shallow and cliche. Is it bad? No. Is it amazing? No. It's nice enough, but nice enough has a way of becoming...well...unengaging."
1,Very disappointing,"This book is very poorly written and lacks of any useful information. I am shocked that it was ever even published. One example here: On fund raising, her suggestion is ""Do a Garage Sale/Sell your stuff on ebay/lemonade stand"". As a veteran filmmaker I am deeply disappointed and find some reviewers here extrememly misleading and dishonest."
5,Exellent!!!,"This book is extremely valuable, specially for new film makers that are just learning the ropes. The book has tons of practical and useful information that very rarely would be learned at school, unless, of course, they ask you to read this book."
5,Everything you need to know,"If you want to make short films read this book. Kim Adelman leaves no stone unturned in her book The Ultimate Filmmaker's Guide To Short Films. Everything from how to get money, to how to find actors, to how to secure music rights is covered.The good thing about the affordability of filmmaking technology nowadays is that anyone can make a film. The problem with the affordability of filmmaking technology nowadays is that anyone can make a film. This means that there are a glut of ammeters making films and that these films are predictably amateurish. If you want to stand out from the crowd I urge you to take a good look at this book.Far from being homework this book is easy to read and understand. It is not a dry ""how-to"" book, but more of an informative pep talk. Kim Adelman makes you chomp at the bit to get out there and make your film.So, get out there and make your movie! But first read The Ultimate Filmmaker's Guide To Short Films."
2,Moderately useful book,"I found this book to be of limited value. There is some good techinical information on dealing with SAG and other industry stuff but I found it wildly lacking in other areas. Kim Adelman is a Producer of short films as far as I know she hasn't actually got behind the camera. So the book wasn't very good with the whole being creative part nor paticularly inspiring. She makes everything seem real expensive and a 26 man crew to make a short! Robert Rodriguez would be turning over in his grave if he were dead. I think aspiring film makers are better off reading a ""Rebel without a Crew"" first make few films ,learn by doing, then add this book so they can understand how a producer thinks."
4,Informative,So far its really a smart book full of great info and tips.Great suggestions for the start up film maker.
2,Absence of Lyrics Makes Song Book Un-Fun,I noticed the review that the book was without lyrics and thought I would enjoy the songbook anyway. I did not. It just isn't fun to play without the words.
2,No lyrics. Not for beginers.,"I bought this thinking my daughter would use this book for her piano lessons, music she liked and could sing. Unfortunately there are no lyrics to any songs. My daughter has taken piano lessons for two years and it is just too complicated for her. Mostly I was so dissapointed that their were no lyrics. We could have saved it for the future and just sang the songs. Ultimatley a return for us."
3,So-So,WeLL i AM A HUGE fan of these books but this one didn't have the same appeal to me as most of the other ones did. This one really did show Sunita that Feral cats belong where they came from and that I don't know I really love cats but this book just didn't click. I wouldn't say this is a has-to read.If you like these books you may be a bit disappointed as was I. Hope I helped
5,Impressing...,"This book was very good, I thought. It was about Sunita and her love of cats. She doesn't understand Feral Cats-until she gets bitten by one. This book is about love and trust, faith and bravery, and homeless cats."
4,I can rock you all night long,"This is a follow up album to the albumThe Real Folk Blues. It was released in 1967, with a title designed to cash in on the folk and blues revivals of the 1960s. The songs consist of material recorded in the 1950s. This is good stuff, and blues fans should enjoy it."
5,Best book on PCs I have come across,"I've your fantastic book, How to Do Everything with Your PC, and I do have to say it's the best book I've purchased yet! It's answered just about every question I've had. Just about everything a person can think of about using a Windows PC is answered in this book, from doing my email, getting on the Internet, even making digital movies -- it's answered in this book."
5,Very nice and different than what you normally see,I bought this shirt as a gift for my mailman who is a Giants fan. I'm an Eagles fan and I liked this shirt enough that I will likely buy an Eagles version for myself. I like the fact that it is completely different than the other options that everyone else seems to have.
3,Tiresome detective satire,"I usually gobble up Belloc, but this one left me with a sense of indigestion. This is intended as a satirical pastiche of a number of different detective/mystery writers from the early part of the century. I don't care for that genre. There, I've said it--just shut the door on the whole lot. I suppose if you like this sort of thing, you might find it amusing. Oh, and there are funny pictures by G. K. Chesterton. Okay, maybe this book is a bit of a lark, after all. I'm still shutting the door, though."
4,"Misleading beginning, but a good read.","Mason St. Clair, Earl of Ashlin, had a title, very little money, and three nieces who were eligible for marriage but needed to be made ""suitable"" for potential husbands. The woman he finds for this training is Riley Fontaine, an actress and woman of questionable reputation. Though she has little money herself, what she does have is personality and quite a temper. Although this book has its amusing moments, perhaps the story would have been better served if it stuck closer to its chilling prologue. The characters here were rather superficial, and Riley seemed to be the only person of any substance here. We hope Ms. Boyle's next book will be truer to its introduction."
3,should be four times the size,"I was hoping this would have a bit more weight towards the hook end. It's evenly balanced, which sucks if you want to actually use it off of a rope. I intended to use this to catch trash out of my retention pond, and it does help, but if it were four times bigger I would probably have better luck."
3,Nice flag.,This is not the flag I received. The flag I received has Ravens Country written across the bottom in very big white letters.
2,incoherent where not overextended,"This book fails to meet the requirement for the semantic agreement. Goodman talks about the ""verification theory of meaning"" and then proceeds to use words in ways which are contradictory to their definition. There is a good deal of manipulation used by the author, which leaves the reader wondering about the basis for this book's publication. There may be a method of philosophy which relies of fictive circumstances but this does not determine any progressive routes. I was disappointed in this book being assigned at the college level. The problem of ""grue"" is merely a question of stasis and is no more than a phonetic invention which aims at a temporal control via mutable definition. Skip in favor of more effective works."
4,"Gentle, Smooth Moves and Gentle Music","This routine was easy to follow on my first viewing. I'm not overly coordinated and find some workouts are so dancey and poorly cued that you have to repeatedly rewind to get the steps; this wasn't one of those.The workout is not intense. Even for someone with a moderate fitness level, it isn't a heart-thumping, high intensity routine. The workout consists of graceful dance steps, interspersed with repetitive, fluid arm raises and leg lifts.A word of caution here - the routine starts with stretches on the floor; no warm up to increase body temperature and blood flow to the muscles before stretching them, which increases the chances for a pulled muscle.The instructor's use of a teleprompter is a bit obvious, but this is only a slight distraction from her beautiful, graceful moves. She's just so darn lovely and likeable, it doesn't matter."
1,Terribly disappointed,"Had seen a review in the health section of my newspaper and it seemed to combine a lot of factors I was looking for. However, I found there to be no challenge or benefit from any of the movements. Very disappointed."
5,Balocity DVD,I love this workout! I use it maybe twice a week (three times on a good week) and can already tell I am more toned. Ballet is the BEST exercise!
3,exercise ladies,I ordered this for a small group of ladies who exercise together. It was a good workout but too fast for our group to keep up.
3,Echo Bridge's Release of Subspecies I-III,"All three movies are on a flipper disc. On the one side is Subspecies and Bloodstone: Subspecies II and on the other side is Bloodlust: Subspecies III. No special features or videozones - the set just contains the movies. The picture quality is typical of full moon pictures DVD releases, ie. vhs-like transfers."
4,Great for the price,"THE QUALITY IS DEFINITLY A TRANSFER FROM VIDEO ITS GRAINY AND THE SOUNDS LOW, OVERALL ITS WATCHABLE AND YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE.tHE PACKAGE CAME REALLY FAST TOO THE SELLER IS GREAT."
4,Great little stone,For general purpose sharpening this is a great tool to have handy. A must for every woodworker
2,Poor quality,"Alarm would go off, without being set, & then would not turn off?. Had to remove batteries to stop larm,?"
4,A Helpful Book Indeed,"This guide covers many little known areas of the State. Some of the info is a little outdated but overall for a book published 30 years ago, it is an excelent source for reference."
5,A Must to Read For Those Wanting to Reach Gen X,"Fantastic, insightful, accurate and not filled with fluff. Celek et al. get to the heart of what makes this midnset tick. Their focus is always biblical and on target. It's great reading for those in the lay ministry or those in full time ministry.This book will help you understand why reaching Gen X is different than reaching the Boomers. It's different approach to a different group. A must to read."
5,uncovering America's intellectual heritage,"This is a remarkable and rigorous book by a first-rate scholar and stylist. It reveals the fact that America's intellectual and philosophical heritage is informed not just by English and Scottish thinkers (Locke, Reid)and French philsophes (Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu) who influenced the early republic, but also by Germany philosphers. Using primary sources, Goetzmann shows how German immigrants in the 1800s imported not only lager beer and sausages, but also the thought and dialectic of Hegel. Goetzmann does a service in uncovering the diversity of our intellectual past."
4,very interesting book,"a very good foreword, the book of a master in ethimology, the work of a plenty life studyng words origin, a master piece"
4,Very interesting and enlightening,"If linguistics or the history of the English language interests you, this book will fill a void in where English originates and how English ties in with the larger family of Indo-European languages. On its face, this subject may seem dry, but once you start reading about words in common usage, you will probably become fascinated in how those words have evolved."
3,What am I doing wrong?,"My kitchen knives were somewhat dull but useable. I bought this sharpener in coarse and extra fine. After doing over 100 strokes each side on each of the stones, the knives are only somewhat sharper. Could it be that they need to be professionally sharpened first? I believe I have the angle and technique right from watching videos."
3,"They're pretty lame, but they're pretty","These are for when you have many guests and need salt and pepper placed periodically down the tables. We've bought eight pairs total. They don't let salt and pepper out very well but sure look nice. (Also, as an aside, preground pepper tastes like black paper. Get a grinder.)"
5,Femmes killed me,"I love this CD !!!!!!!!!!!!cant get enough of these dj divas.. i reccomend it highly to anyone with an interest in dance music and female vocalists,,,,,one of my favs for this year!"
3,The mirror....,The mirror is not as stable as I would like it to be but I guess it does it's job. I think they screws that need to go into the back should be longer.
4,Great !,"I bought the mirror and matching 6 drawer dresser, they were easy to I stall very durable and work just fine."
3,Damaged goods.,"While the rest of this bedroom suite came in great condition, the mirror was damaged. The glass itself was fine, but the piece of wood that fits across the top was broken in half. I ended up just leaving it off."
1,DOA- LOUSY SUPPORT from MACVISION !,"I WAS TO EXCITED ABOUT THE PRODUCT, however what a disappointment. After ordering from AMazon for $36.99, I gotone that doesn't do anything. Charged for a whole day!! ONlyred LED comes on.. SO called Green LED never comes on or it isthe WRONG (CHEAP chinese) manual.TRIED to get help from macvision.com and calling their 800 # istotal waste.. I think it is an answering service. They alwaysforwards the call to a recording machine. I am really surprisedat others luck ( or at my badluck)!!"
1,Bad Experience,"I should have read other's reviews before I purchased this. The directions made no sense and didn't explain anything. After charging headphones for a very long time, they wouldn't come on or do anything. Luckily, Amazon.com is a great company and I was able to return the junk. I hope they discontinue to offer this item on their site."
1,"Product did not turn on at all, looks good though","The item did not turn on at all, it does turn on when plugged through USB to put the music on and I can do that, but then it doesn't turn on to listen to it. I knew there gotta be something wrong when the price was 13 bucks!!!!don't buy it, spend some more money on something else"
2,Like a child who misbehaves seeking adult attention,"Real cowboys and soldiers don't chatter on endlessly about how strongly and courageously they do the job--they shut up and do it. Real men take the consequences and serve their sentences when they're busted--they don't prostitute their wives by sending them out to make sniveling pleas for their husbands' clemency on national television. Liddy's autobiography reads like the ludicrous bragging of a 12-year-old boy who wants approval from the big boys and will scream ever louder until he gets their attention. Is he a hero? Is he a sociopath? Neither; he's sometimes weak, frequently pathetic and, ultimately, not nearly as interesting as he desperately wants us to believe."
4,A life changer...,I read this in high school after a recommendation from a friend. Not political at the time it was recommended because of the subject...Will power. Forget his or your politics. The story of how this man molded himself and steeled his Will is a fascinating account of how one can accept limitations placed on him(physical or mental) or choose to set out on a path of his own making. And this has nothing to do with economics (regarding his privlidged upbringing and future success say like a Donald Trump who claims to have made his fortune himself while being a product of a millionaire father) but a man systematically conquering each of his fears one by one and forging a future for himself.His account of his stint is prison for his involvement in Watergate is worth the price of the book alone.
3,"Portrait of a very smart, very strange, fanatic","I've always found myself stragely fascinated by G. Gordon Liddy. Both in his book, and in his radio show, he comes off as extremely bright; thoughtful; funny; and brutally honest. At the same time, however, he is extraordinarily creepy, as he talks about being drawn to Hitler as a child, the relish with which he describes becoming a kingpin of sorts in jail, and choosing his wife on the basis of her genetic endowment. And of course, who can forget his holding his hand over open flames until he ""cooked"" his knuckles?"
5,Absolutely Interesting and Inspiring!,"G. Gordon Liddy is a very interesting and inspiring man and the book is just as interesting and inspiring read. I didn't want to put it down. This book should be printed again, along with a Kindle (as well as other e-book formatted) release. In addition, I'd like to see it in audio format so it can be listened to while driving, etc.G. Gordon does not disappoint in anything he does and it's evident by what he's accomplished and overcome so far."
5,"WILL, the Autobigraphy of G. Gordon Liddy",The authentic story a historic American figure. There are many lessons in these pages that one can apply to thier own life reagradless of wether or not they agree with Mr. Liddy's choices. The ability to choose a course and see it through without hesitiation or whinning is a lost and dying art in this country. I hghly recommend it.I was also extremely pleased with the price and quality that Amazon provided on this purchase.
4,Sociopath or Genius?,"G. Gordon Liddy's autobiography is fascinating, mainly because it leaves me with more questions about the man than I had before. Is he a genius or a sociopath? You decide:He conquered his fear of rats by killing, cooking and eating them. He routinely tests his willpower by burning himself with candles and cigarettes.After Watergate broke, he concluded that his superiors would be best served by assassinating him, and asked his boss to ``tell him when, and what street corner, and he would be there.''Later, he was brought to a meeting with his lawyers, and encountered his old boss John Dean. He concluded that he was brought there for the purpose of killing Dean--after all, Dean was there; Liddy was there; and look! A pencil on the desk! Obviously intended to serve as his weapon!Read the book--you'll be fascinated. And you'll wonder more than ever: is the man a genius or a sociopath?"
3,"Liddy, the great defender of Coney Island","This book shows how Liddy defended NY's Coney Island during the Korean War. It tells of his wealthy upbringing in a New Jersey suburb and how he never wanted for anything. It explains, in detail, his efforts to please his super-successful and remote father.The book highlights the hypocrisy of today's right wing talk show host: the author romanticizes war without having fought, pushes tax cuts that assist no one but himself and his elite friends, advocates cuts in education knowing his family will never need public education and launches unamerican personal attacks on political opponents in the name of ""patriotism.""That said...Liddy is a supremely interesting character and has had a great deal of life experiences. The book is worth the read, but you should probably buy it used."
2,Liddy's a legend in his own mind,"If your idea of an American hero is a man who burns holes in his own flesh, takes pride in his ability to kill a person with a pencil, and congratulates himself for harassing prison guards and filing frivilous lawsuits, ""Will"" is for you. Otherwise, you won't find a lot likable about the man. Constantly self-serving, Liddy has a definite superiority complex. Despite his adulation for his own intelligence and education, he seems to have missed the point that his own short-sighted criminal behavior set back the conservative movement that he sought to serve by about a decade, and the whole Watergate fiasco actually strengthened the political opponents that he sought to weaken. ""Will"" tries to make the case that the means is worth the end, but ultimately just illustrates that isn't the case at all."
3,As Close As You'll Ever Get to Understanding Him,"I read ""Will"" in the early 80's and was fascinated. It provides the reader with somewhat of a glimpse as to what makes G. Gordon Liddy tick, but the tone of this book leaves no doubt that its author is also making a huge investment in his ego. Therefore, I recommend that the reader take a good deal of his story with a grain of salt.Although I consider Liddy to be one of the most deranged and outright weird persons on the American political landscape, this book is nevertheless a good read because you'll get to understand (and if you're of his political persuasion, perhaps even agree with) the environment that breeds such an enigmatic persona."
1,bad quality,"There are some good parts in this film, but there is no option to use scene selection, the quality was very bad, and it seemed to me that it was a bootleg copy of a disk. so in my option this dvd is not worth a buy. what's the point of paying for bad quality and still pictures."
3,Nice book but needs more illustrations,"in fact i have read many books in gemstones identifications but this one is good in knowledge but it requires more colors , pictures and illustrations.. as most of us knows that without illustrations its hard for some people to imagine..."
2,Identification of Gemstones,"this book could be useful for entry level student but very useless for professional level or advance stage of gemology, it is also very high priced."
2,What do I know?,"I am about 60 pages into the book and don't think I can get through it. It seems to be written in some other language almost. It jumps from this thought to that, and I find myself backing up to try and make sense of what is there. I know from reading reviews from other readers and renoun authors that it is a good story, but nobody mentions her style which I find to say the least is very confusing. I am considering sending this book back for a refund. I love stories of the south and by southern authors but this one is hard work."
2,Uneven and problematic,"Not a horrible book, but not a great one either. The characterization is uneven - for instance, Fannie's mother is made to say how much she adores her daughter at the beginning, but in fact, their relationship is rather prickly. It is unclear how Fannie feels about her husband; their dialogue is often confusing. Actually, much of the dialogue is confusing. The narrative and perspective shifts oddly and I had difficulty staying with it. The only reason I finished the book is because I wanted to see who killed Earnest. That WAS surprising. Additionally, sometimes Neilson gives us far too much detail. I often felt lost in the picayune.Although it does, I think, portray the South of the 1960's fairly well, if in a rather stererotypical fashion, I did not find this book cause for exhilaration. I've read many other Southern and non-Southern writers that were far more enjoyable, understandable and clear."
5,Great CD,"IF you are a dashboard confessional fan, this is a must for you. They do a great job of capturing the sound of DC. The only thing i wish that they had was more songs, lets hope that they release a second the thrid volume. Great job."
5,Strings,The String Quartets that play these songs do a phenomenal job. Dashboard's original music shines through and is very recognizable. The strings and Chris's music sound so beautiful together. Definte buy for anyone who loves stringed instruments or the music of Dashboard Confesional.
3,"Some of the Best, Not All","This cd is very refreshing for country music fans.It has some of Mick Flavin's best songs like Jennifer Johnson and Travellin' Light, but not other favorites like The Rarest of Flowers or The Old Side of Town, so I gave it just three stars.There are better collections of his songs.Hard to find,though."
4,Comfort and stylish,These shoes look much better in person! The pictures don't do it justice. The heel is a a perfect height and balance to dance in. I wear these for my burlesque class and they look cute with so many outfits and also worn with tights or leggings. These shoes don't have to be just for ballroom dancing! The lining is suede and the bottom of the shoe is made of non skid/marking black suede so that they glide across a floor so easy but also gives great traction. The only reason why I didn't give a 5 star rating is because the straps is way too long and I ended up cutting them.
5,Best stocking stuffer of the season,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and wanted to make sure it was compatiable with his phone and worked before writing a review.It has worked great, the product was exactly as described and the price was the best I could find on the internet (and significantly better than what I can find locally). Excellent service! He has been using it in his phone to play mp3s and it has worked just as expected. Thank you."
4,Sounds great but a little lacking.,"Not sure if the string quartet was the best way to pay a tribute to Audioslave. It sounds great, but 4 instruments can hardly display the power of Audioslave. Again, however it still sounds great."
3,For the music fan from USA,"Audioslave is made up of four instruments; guitar, bass, vocals, and drums. It is very odd that you would say that four instruments can harldy display the power of Audioslave, even though Audioslave is a group made up of four instruments......"
1,What a disgrace!!!,"I gave it a chance but I couldn't even finish the CD, it was so godawful. The only saving grace to this CD was that this so-called ""classical"" take on good rock and roll was almost humorous. Like the retarded renditions of pop songs, that some sketch comedies use, in order to poke a little fun at pop culture."
4,Sounds good,"I can think of a reason why they did not bother to convert any Rage Against The Machine Songs to a classical piece it wouldn't work. No offence to their fans but, Rage does not orchastrate their instruments like some other metal bands. Using chellos and instruments as such on Rage would be a waste. I can see Audio Slave working just fine and Apocolyptica's many conversions of Metallica's older stuff but not rage.So to me, this quartet tribute to Audio Slave sounds worth it.Now if someone would attempt to cover Iced Earth on chellos!!!!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!,"If your a fan of shocking and crazy videos of people getting shot, ran over, or people jumping to their death. Then don't buy this dvd it sucks plain and simple all it shows is the aftermath of people who died and it doesn't even tell you how the died all you see is people like cops and EMTs poking at a dead body. Waste of money and time save your money for something else like BANNED FROM TELEVISON... NOW THAT IS A GOOD DVD."
5,Choosing Light heartedness,"This book is so easy and clear, that it could be given to anyone who is trying to find a way out of deppression. Kari embodies a warm and understanding way of encouraging the reader to trust in a positive outcome from the very first pages. This books light and familiar language offer simple, creative and doable exercises, that instill hope and the feel good factor never leaves you from start to finnish. What else can change you life more than your perception of it."
4,Fairly New,"Only used it a few times. I am not an expert, but it works well to bring my kitchen knives back to new quality. Not sure how the stone will hold up over time, but I am happy for what it does now."
3,Works Alright,"I purchased and received this fine ""stone"" and the coarse version of it. After sharpening just one set of hair clipper blades on this one and the coarse one, they both seamed to have lost their grit. I contacted DMT, they said to clean them with kitchen cleanser and a scrub brush. That helped, but they still are not as gritty as the first few uses. I think for knives these are great, for heat treated steel hair trimmer blades not so much."
3,Worked Great for 2 Years,"I've had this gigabit Ethernet card for two years. It worked great until the card suddenly acted strange and then died. For the price, though, I would say that I've been satisfied with it. I was using it with WinXP."
4,Ethernet Card,Used on spare laptop to connect to home Ethernet. Inserted into laptop and off it went. Also use this spare laptop on Wi-fi at another location...no conflicts...
2,I'm more Bohemian that you!,"I think that pretty much sums up this book. It is essentially a person trying to squeeze a movement that stands for individuality into a pattern not unlike an organized religion, which I'm sure most real 'Bohemians' would object to. The 'Bohemianism' that this book describes is an elitist club in which you must start your day off with a cup of coffee (not from Starbucks),drink wine, and balance eclectic and sometimes extravagent style with the poverty necessary to be more 'Bohemian' than the average Bush-voting, Church-attending Capitalist.That being said, it is fun to read and has some meager value in it. If you read fast and can get the book for cheap, then go for it. It's more productive than watching soap operas or browsing MySpace, if that's what you're going to be doing, anyway. If 2.5 stars was an option, I would have given it the extra credit. Just don't get distracted by the shiny object that is incognito conformity."
3,"Good Book, but an Obvious Question","I thought this book was quite good and fun to read. But there seems to be an obvious question: if she's serious about Bohemianism, shouldn't this book be free?"
1,common sense anyone?,"Had this review been based on comedic relief, I would have given this book five thigh-slapping, eye-watering stars. Cover to cover I was cracking up. If I ever met this woman, I would give her a GIANT hug for validating everything that people (ahem, the ones she's writing about) didn't necessarily want validated. I suppose the true ""bohemian"" reaction would be apathy. Excuse me now whilst I enjoy my clove, Bukowski, and sweetened Arabian coffee. Ahem."
5,"10"" DMT course, extra course bench stone","Probably the fastest way to flatten your water stones, but not the cheapest. The cheapest would be 220 grit wet or dry sandpaper on a flat surface like float glass or granite surface plate. I purchased it for flattening water stones so can't comment on using it as a tool sharpening product. I've just used it a couple of times. It is fast and no hassle."
5,Nice Stone,"Large stone is expensive, but given the size, well worth the $.Cuts worn plane and chisel blades nicely.Good prep for the fine / medium stone."
1,Did not recieve the product I ordered!!,The product I recieved was not the product pictured. It was not one piece but three difficult pieces. I was not given the opportunity to decide if I wanted what they shipped me verses the product I ordered.
5,Kodak battery charger kit,"Fast delivery of the product, & in good condition. I would definitelyuse this seller again!"
1,may not fully charge high capacity cells,"May not (or will not) fully charge high capacity cells - this issue is reported in reviews on other websites.My experience: 2100mAh cells (non-Kodak) won't fully charge, but cells get real warm. Switching to another brand charger DOES complete the charge, and cells are cooler.Specification sheet (K605.pdf): Maximum size for this charger is 2100mAh - these cells are supposed to take 17.5 hours. BUT charger also automatically shuts off at 17.5 hours, regardless. (Go figure.)"
1,i don't received this product.,"This product is not received it...puede que este sea muy buen producto, o puede que no, la verdad es que no lo se por que el vendedor no me lo envio y cuando debio hacerlo y cuando por fin crei que me reembolsaria el dinero, ellos me dicen que lo han enviado, aun cuando les dije en dos oportunidades que no me enviaran el producto, desde miami a venezuela es algo asi como muy caro pagar un envio por solo un cargador de baterias."
3,It's good but too low charging,"It's good and meets the specs,but if you don't have at least 18 hour to leave the batteries getting charged,think about it."
2,Can't get past the smell !,"I used these once turning pork cutlets - - I thought the food tasted funny but didn't comment on it. However, my family all expressed the same reaction -- the meat tasted ""odd"" and sure enough when I smelled the tongs they smelled ""odd"". I have washed them several times but they still have a new plastic smell. I am reluctant to use them and ruin more food. I may try soaking them in baking soda - anyone else have any suggestions to remove the off smell/taste?"
2,Mechanical,"The recording is not of the composers performing their own pieces, but piano-rolls made by the composer for the general public back in the '20s. While the engineering of these rolls is excellent and no doubt of historical value for the esoteric collector, the recordings provide a music box result of the composers work."
4,"Little Cord, Long extension.","There's really not much that's changed in the new SE line from Shure. So, I'll be brief.1) (+) Amazing sound! The same drivers as the SE3xx series but no bass chamber...so you wont get a lot of thump. But crystal clear sound. I believe the drivers are the same as the previous E3c/g.2) (+) Great isolation - save your hearing. :)3) (-) The cord is like 1.5 ft. Which would be great if I wore a clipon/iPod Shuffle, but I put an ipod in my backpack...so i have to use the extension (included). The extension creates extra weight in the cord (where it connects)...means the cord feels heavy. Me no likey.4) (+) Sweet ballistic nylon carrying case.Overall: great sound at a great value if you can get past the little cord & extension."
4,Great Sound-HATE THE CORD!,"Highly recommend UNLESS you use your ipod to exercise. I ignored the comment about the short cord in the previous review but this turned out to be a much bigger pain then I realized. If you use an armband, you HAVE to use the extension and the cord is heavy & bulky. I switched to my husbands V-Moda's & was in heaven. Perfect cord length, lightweight, great sound (although not as crisp) but at half the price a bargain. Something to consider if the length/bulkiness of the cord might be a problem for you."
5,Very good earphones!,"Another reviewer really disliked two-part cord. I love this feature! It allows me to wear my player in my shirt pocket or on the neck clip without wires hanging out and catching everything. The connector adds some extra weight and bulk - but that is a small price to pay for the flexibility and convenience. Sound is great, sound insulation is also very good. I'm happy."
2,Broke TWICE in a month!,"I like the way these headphones sound, and the isolation is nice on planes. BUT they broke in two separate areas within the first month.First, one of the little ear stems broke inserting the bud in my ear. A little crazy glue fixed it, but that's a pretty poor design.Then the headphone jack to my iPod developed a crackling sound that made it impossible to use. I travel a great deal for work and this was on a business trip, which left me without headphones for the rest of the trip.When I returned home, I sent the headphones back to Shure and waited ... and waited.Two months later, I emailed Shure to ask where they were and they explained they were replacing them with new ones and that for some reason the shipment order got lost in the shuffle. I got replacements three days later. I'm guessing if I didn't email they would still be sitting there."
4,decent sound,"I use these with my cowon s9, after playing around with the equalizer I managed to achieve a decent realistic sound, good level of details, but I have to admit that I was expecting a little more difference than the SE110, I would compare them to the Ultimate ears studio 3.0; while the UE delivers more detailed sound and vibrant highs, the sound is more industrial than realistic, SE210 gives a more realistic performance, but not as vibrant, so it all depends on what u like more."
3,comfortable,"I really like all of the different choices for ear pieces. Sound is great , my only complaint is the wire that attaches to my ipod, it is very heavy."
5,Great earphones,"I was reluctant to buy higher end earphones, but I was tired of the poor fit and sound quality of the cheaper ones. These earphones fit great, are comfortable, and the sound is perfect. They are an ideal demonstration that you get what you pay for. I am not a musician or classical music afficionado, and I don't know if the higher-end Shures are better than these for certain types of listening. For my purposes (listening to music at the gym and on the subway), these are more than adequate."
3,There are better headphones out there,"I used to have the Shure E3c, which the SE210 has presumably replaced, being of the same price point. HOWEVER, The E3c is far superior from an imaging and mid to high frequency standpoint, and I already miss them when listening to jazz or other detailed midrange music.Don't be fooled like me, these are not the replacement for the similarly priced E3c. For anyone that likes a clear, well represented range, these will probably disappoint. The SE210 definitely improved on the bass, but overall they seem quite dull and not as impressive as the model that preceded it.3 stars however, because the optional length cord is quite useful--less excess to drag around when your device is sitting on your upper body or has its own volume control cord."
5,Great.....,"These are great earphones at a great price. Sound quality is very good, and not too heavy on the bass. Fot the price, the sound quality is excellent.Great ear fit with a choice of 3 foam, 3 silicone, and 1 longer silicone (my choice) covers. Great at eliminating sound generated in tne surrounding environment when you fit the correct cover for you ear size. They stayed firmly in my ears while I was runing on the tred mill (30 minutes), and no readjustment was necessary.My wife tried these in her MP3 and is ready to ditch her Bose earpgones--guess I'll be ordering her a pair of these soon, since she keeps borrowing mine.The build of these is very sturdy (they aren't as fragile as they look), and the thicker cords look like they will hold up to steady use.The only CON I can come up with: I do not care for the short cord with a 3 foot extension--the connector just seems burdensome, and out of place. This is a minor inconvenience and will not deter me from buying my wife a pair."
2,No bass,"This is going to be short because there's very little to say about the SE210's.1.- If you shove them as far in to your ear as they'll go, you will have neutral/low base sound... but then your ears will hurt.Worth $30 just cos of the foam tips. I use these only at work to listen to youtube videos, podcasts... listening to music doesn't do the music justice... even with BBE's Mach3Bass!I've order some SE530's for music listening in bed... Shure they better be good or your black listed!BTW: I own some Denon AH-D5000's and they're TOTALLY AWESOME in every regard, but too big to wear in bed :("
3,Sizes,"Despite the three sizes of foam covers, none was small enough for my use. The smallest size would not fit. As a result, the sound was muffled."
3,Decent Experience,The item shipped fast. I did however order the item in white and it came in black. No one notified me to let me know and this was a gift for someone who wanted white.
2,extremely dissapointing,"This isn't my first set of in the ear headphones. I'm so bummed with these. I've had Shure's before, my e2C's were awesome. My ultimate ears superfi 5's were awesome. These are so bad i'm sending them back after 10 minutes of using them.They make all of the audio out of m iPhone sound like it's compressed and being streamed over the internet. They are pretty cheesy feeling too. Thought i was going to break them changing the ear attachment."
3,Not quite the perfect earphones...,"Sure SE210 Earphones are the most comfortable I've tried and deliver excellent sound quality. The wiring leaves something to be desired. The wires connecting to the earphones are lightweight, which I like, but VERY short. Unless you have your iPod in your pocket or are using a clip on shuffle, you'll have to use the extension that's provided. The extension is way too long and is a much heavier cable. Not quite sure where to put all that extra wire, other than wrap it with a twist tie. This detracts from an otherwise excellent product."
4,I was pleased,"The product works as advertised - it works as earplugs if you want it to. Only problem is, my ears are too small for most of the earpieces, so I had to use the clearish sticky ones, which as you can imagine, attracts fuzz and crap whenever I put them down."
2,bad choices,"This product was not a good choice to enhance sound on my iPod. The much cheaper headphones that came with the iPod have much richer sound. These earphones sound tinny in comparison. Maybe good for other uses, but not a 4G iPod."
4,A cautionary tale,"If you approach Religious Experience intent on debunking authoritative perspectives on what religious experience consists of, you won't be disappointed by Proudfoot's deconstruction of Schleiermacher, James, and others. The vast majority of the book concerns itself with citing these other thinkers and explaining why none of their paradigms holds up to close scrutiny. Proudfoot's scalpel is sharp and polished, but the dominance of slicing over building results in a handful of scraps that would benefit from a better reintegration and innovation than Proudfoot is able to offer. Regardless, an illuminating and entertaining read."
4,Fun!!!,This is a fun book that my 4 yr old requested from the library so many times I went ahead and purchased our own copy!Fun!!!!
5,Fabulous!,My 3 yr old daughter loves this book. We read it over and over. It's an adorable story about a spunky little girl who makes friends with an ogre. I highly recommend this book.
3,"Good kit, minor flaws",The pros:- perfect cast material is highly durable- educational pamphlet is well doneThe cons:- directions for measuring the correct plaster amount are misleading- supplied magnets are not strong enough to support larger size pieces on fridge(refers to Velociraptor kit)- no glaze is provided to cover finished pieces
3,Book Review,Its a book.... can't say much more. Had to buy it for a class I am enrolled in at a local college. Delivery was quick and the cost was better than the school's book store. I paid less for the book than a used edition at the college. I don't think its a particularly great text book.
2,Meh,"This book may be a good reference--maybe--, but there tends to be a lot of glossing over, with core concepts of complex things being left unexplained. They're probably obvious to someone more versed in the field, but for an ""Introduction"" book I'd hope for a bit more.On the other hand, certain parts of this book were quite solid. Just don't expect to use it as your only reference."
3,My son requested this brand.,Sent a case to my college son. He says Che Boyardee is the best. It has too many carbs and too much salt for me.
1,Returned,"We had high hopes for the Sportfolio Deluxe 15"" MacBook Pro case after reading some of the reviews and knowing that it was designed specifically for the MacBook Pro. However, we quickly ended up with a broken zipper pull and were plagued with the extremely squeaky swivels that attach the straps. Because of the broken zipper pull, we've returned the case."
3,Not bad,"This case is very nice, but it has one problem with it's workmanship. Inside both handles is a stabilizer that is attached inside the handle that extends down to that actual case. In some cases this stabilizer will seperate from the case which causes the handles to stretch and being unusable. This is a not good."
4,Great alternative to stones,"It's called a whetstone but really it's a hollow plastic box with a perforated metal plate on top and a seperate plastic baseplate with rubber feet. Sounds cheap, but works really well. I don't know how long it would last as it's not like a thick stone that is gradually ground down - it's just the single diamond-encrusted plate. That said, it is diamond and did a great job of sharpening my santoku ... will be working through the rest of my kitchen knives and then when I get the Fine and Coarse versions of this stone in a few weeks will work on my KA-BAR, SOG tomahawk and other utility knives. Would be nice if the stone or holder said ""Extra Fine"" on it in case I can't remember the colour-coding once I have the set of stones, but rectified with a Sharpie. Now I can get rid of that damn useless honing rod!"
4,Crooks Collection,"I've been a fan of Richard Crooks for years. While I love the warm RCA sound of the 78's, I have never appreciated Prima Voce's very flat transfers. Quite honestly, I don't care for any of their transfers and prefer to master the 78's onto my own CD's. That said, these are clean in so far as there are no noticeable scratches or record ride, but the quality of those warm recordings is no where in sight. Too Bad. Perhaps RCA will come out with a Crooks Anthology wherein the sound will really make it worth while to enjoy again these long lost recordings."
5,"Seth, Jane & Rob Unplugged - Vol 1","In this wonderful little volume, you see Seth, Jane & Rob in a less 'cosmetic' way than you see them in the ""Seth Books"" per se. For example, Jane used to pace around the room while delivering material from Seth.The various reincarnational stories Seth gives about people Jane & Rob know (as well as about Jane & Rob themselves) can make for very compelling reading. You may find yourself examining your own life and circumstances (or those of friends and loved ones) looking for the parallels.There are also fairly detailed ""scientific"" ideas from Seth on how the physics of reality works. Some readers may want to gloss over these areas.You will also notice that Seth is a very humorous soul. His affection for Jane & Rob is immense. This volume definitely put a new spin on the Seth books for this reader. Enjoy!"
5,"Review of ""Lady of Mallow""","Personally, I find that this book indeed has many twists that leaves the reader engaged fully in this tantalizing novel. Not only does it have a beautiful love drama of two men who do not seem as they first appear, but it also collides with the horror of murder and mystery as to a family's past and present. I fully recommend this book to any mystery or romance lover, for it has been beautifully writen by a brilliant mind."
3,"Good, but there is better","Essentially this is the same Howlin' Wolf heard on the previous recordings, 1959's Howlin' Wolf and 1962's Moanin' in the Moonlight (both of which were compilations of singles, many of which are classics, released by the Wolf throughout the 1950s). 1966's The Real Folk Blues, recorded in the early to mid 1960s features the larger than life growling voice and riffs, as well as the monster swagger of those amazing earlier recordings and the fact that Wolf is writing all of his own material instead of recording Willie Dixon`s songs subtracts little quality. Still, this is second rate Howlin'' Wolf when compared to those recordings. The newly added horn section, which adds little and removing much of the Wolf's impeccable grit, is the main reason. Howlin' Wolf's first two LPs are available on one disc, if you like those then I recommend you check out this album."
4,A Dog Training Encyclopedia,"The book contains lots of information, written in a simple, straight forward, plain style.The book is not comprehensive, but it is a good starter and covers a broad assortment of topics.The tricks are rated by difficulty and impressiveness.It even has sections on rehabilitation of troubled dogs.All in all this book is above average and a good value for the money."
5,Pure GENIOUS!,"This book has EVERYTHING (really)! I have a crazy out-of-control brittany spaniel who has given me no peace and quiet since the day he stepped in my door, but I bought this book yesterday and I was just amazed at how much detail it goes into with solutions for different naughty behaviors and training tips. I tried a few techniques already on my dog and he is definately responding. Thanks so much! This is exactly what I've been looking all over for. This book is SO GOOD. I highly recommend it!"
3,"Good, but nothing Google can't tell you","This book has good info, I bought it when I first got my dog, but it won't tell you anything you can't find out for free through Google.I wouldn't buy this again."
2,Dog Training,This book was just ok. very boring. Uses clicker training throughout the entire book. Does not give any alternative methods. Not the best book.
5,Great Book,I had my dog doing a Hi five in tem min.!!! Easy to understand and helps with any problem.
4,Good Resource,This little book was really helpful to my son and family when they got a dog for the first time.
2,Didn't find this product very effective,"I had been using Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser and on a whim I decided to try the Olay Pore Redefining Cleanser. I religiously use some of the other Olay products and love them so I figured I would give this one a try. I used it for about two weeks and the only difference I saw was that my pores were looking larger! I wanted to give the Olay cleanser more time but I just couldn't stand the way my skin was looking. Once I started using the Neutrogena cleanser again my pores immediately started to appear smaller. The moral is....if you try this product and don't like it, try the Neutrogena. It might work better for you."
1,olay definity scrub,"After a live consultation with someone from Olay, this line was suggested for me. I have found that skin is breaking out more than ever before! I woke up this morning with a big red pimple on the tip of my nose! I'm very disappointed in this product."
5,Just amazing and powerful,"The book gives you insight on the most toughest questions ask. It is very useful, I would recommend this book to anyone."
5,Full of memories,"Julia Dawson's tales of her family growing up in Indiana is a fascinating read. Her vivid details of the lives and times lets you smell the aroma of fresh bread baking on the old kitchen range, feel the warmth of the cloths hung by the oven door on chilly morning and hear the squeaks and groans of the old organ as the children play their self-composed melodies. Julia interweaves her family's history with the national and world events of the time to keep the story in perspective. The book is guaranteed to revive some of your own personal memories of the past."
3,Decent,"Like another Amazon reviewer said, it lathers well. It has an unassuming masculine scent. It cleans well enough, although I like it when a soap, like Irish Spring, kind of makes you feel that cleanliness as well. It advertises ""refreshing,"" but this body lotion doesn't really do that, although it is effective. I think also it's much too easy to use too much of it, so the bottle's contents disappear quickly. What's especially nice about this soap is that it isn't costly, so I don't regret the purchase. I also didn't get a really good take on how well it moisturizes the skin. There's no statement on the bottle that it will moisturize, which is kind of curious. . . ."
1,suave for men?????????????????,"I bought 4 bottles cuz it was 2 bucks each and out of the bottle it had a manly scent similar to axe orion which I enjoyed. But the first time I came to shower I pour out the gel and the stuff smells like all the girly suave products. How can u people say this is for men???????? I hate this stuff all it is is girly suave with blue food coloring to make it look manly and put the suave "" for men"" logo on it and sell it to shops everywhere"
5,This book is more than a heartfelt investigation on the subj,"The shared heart is more than a heartfelt investigation of its subject, it it a moviing study of the human animal. Regardless of ones sexual orientation it should be looked at and carefully read by people everywhere. We have all experienced the feeling of being cast aside by some aspect of our society at some time in out lives. As I have the honor of being a close personal friend of the author I can confirm that his heart, soul and the very essence of his being have all been put into this book. bravo. bravo. bravo."
1,Makes a nice coaster.,It really prevents those cold drink circles on my desk. I keep it face down to avoid being reminded of how bad it is.
2,Bootleg? More like a Hail Mary.,"To this day I still like Damon Wayans the comic actor, but not so much as Damon Wayans the comic. Bootleg took me a whole four nights to get through. It has it's moments but for the most part Wayans really doesn't tell you anything that says ""hey, I'm different than other black comics... or other comics for that matter."" Perhaps the only subject that he goes after that other comics don't is him dissing his movie ""Blankman."" Just reading the back of the book that's a bit about Magic Johnson's attempt into late night talk shows kind of summs the whole book up. For the Wayans fan you're better off finding his ""best of"" from ""In Living Color."" The only other good thing I can say is that the book was given to me as a gift by my brother, and therefore none of my cash was wasted on it."
4,This is pure Damon Wayans,I really enjoyed this book it was like he was right there in front of me telling all his jokes! I mean it's worth this money cause it's so funny! Can't wait to see what he will come out with next! DAMON YOU DA MAN!
3,"Very Funny, but could use some new jokes.","Sept 99.. Very funny, but could use some new jokes. We've heard all of these. Not that they aren't funny, just get some new stuff please. Typical Wayans Stuff. I think they're all crazy! Seriously though, it was good and funny. Just please get some new jokes!"
4,"Damon's First, and Hopefully not last","Damon's book, Bootleg is funny. To really enjoy it is to have missed a lot of his stand-up act's on cable and what not. I gave it four stars because it was funny, but a lot of his old stand-up material was in it. Now if a lot of new material was in it, then, I would have given it 5 stars,..like Drew Carey's Dirty Jokes & Beer. It's a riot for those who can identify with being Black back in the 60's and 70's. I would definatley read another book from Wayans if he were to make a sophmore attempt,..I don't doubt that it would be any less comical."
4,Some of the best comedy in years,Damon has came a long way since In Living Color and it shows. This book of standup material is a riot. Strange though that his brother gets into Scary Movie but I digress. If you like humor it's all good.
4,This is a funny book,"Ok, first of all, I am white. And Damon makes a lot of jokes about being black and also being white. He picks on both races. And both are funny. He says that all white guys use the word ""dude."" Well, I think he's right! Bascially, this book is really funny. It's not all race jokes, though. He makes jokes about women, and children. I haven't seen any of his stand-up specials, so maybe that's why I thought this was so funny. If you like to laugh, then this is a good book to read."
2,Good at first...until the LEDs fail,"I have to agree with the previous review. This was a great lamp for the first month that I had it. However, a single row of LEDs has begun to flicker and after reading the previous review, I am aware of what is to come. I cannot recommend this for anyone, especially for this price!"
3,Nice lamp for considerate people,"If you have need of light in a focused area that won't disturb those around you, this is it. I didn't realize that limitation when I purchased it. If you need more light than that, get one of their gooseneck floorlamps - I also have that and love it."
2,Not much light...,This light is very dim and I am not pleased with the fluorescent nature of the light itself.
4,Looks Good and Built Well...,I have these on my duty belt which is a Bianchi Accumold belt. These belt keepers blend in so you barely notice that you even have belt keepers. I've been wearing the same pair for roughly 7 months and they have not come apart or anything. They fit well in the back but sometimes I have trouble in the front and it's not a problem with the keepers but the actual belt. The front of my belt folds over making that part of the belt twice as thick. So it what I usually do is only snap one button instead of two to accomodate the extra room.
3,"I agree with the review ""Marketing?""","It probably does have great specs compared to the Sony lower priced tape, but I don't see the value either. The retail is pricey and when on sale, it's still not cheap.If you're afraid of using the cheaper Sony stock (cuz you get what you pay for) you might want to look into Panasonic's high end HDV... it's usually half the Sony price for stock with top specs."
4,HD video tape from Sony,"Good tape for taping high definition videos. Never ckear what will happen if I were to re-use this tape. Anyone who purchased a $1000 HD camcorder should not re-use tapes!!I have also used other brands of ""regular"" mini-video tapes in the past 2 years. Only rarely I see problems- means I have not seen any problems so far. I use HD tapes for important events!!"
1,Needlessly Expensive,"This is a very good tape, and my preferred model.However, they are ridiculously, and unnecessarily, expensive. As a result, I will only buy them on sale. Any brand of DV tape will work, even if you are recording in High Definition.The only significant difference between these and less expensive tapes is the additional price."
4,Good recording quality but tape protective cover was damaged in shipping.,One of the five cassettes shipped to me arrived with a smashed plastic case and hinged protective cover. The other tapes worked great!
3,good not excellent,These tapes are ok. When you run the tapes directly to the back of your HD TV the picture is great....When you make copies onto a DVD then the copies are just ok...I am not convinced of the extra money for HD tapes...The best HD Tapes for the extra cashola are Maxell Pro DV-M63Master. I bought 20 of them for 93.00 dollars brand new...Delivered 2 days to the house with free shipping ....Beat That!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ace Batch...I use Corel Ulead VideoStudeo 11 Plus Software...Not Bad...Later Gators...After While Crockadile....Seeeee Yaaaa Sooooon Babooooooon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Our Own-by Trish Maskew,Trish Maskew has managed to thouroughly explain the issues involved in older child adoption. The needs of the child are always foremost in her advice. She has interviewed and quoted knowledgeable members of the adoptive community. The book helps bring to life the daily challenges of older child adoption. It is also useful to anyone adopting children placed a few months to years after birth. Adoptive parents today are looking for tools to help them understand the needs of their children. This book is definately one of them. Jan King-International Adoption Alliance
4,Great,"Great for those who think adopting is super easy (just adopt!) and for those who think it's far too scary (ooh, those kids!). A little less helpful for those who are already in the trenches."
3,Hard to use but works when you get it right,"I use it with medium to long blades so it's tricky to ensure the angle is consistent as the distance from clamp to stone contact varies throughout the stroke, plus I keep catching it on the corner of the stone (probably failure to clear a big enough space on the bench) and occasionally it comes off the bench on the draw stroke. That said, it produces a consistent and super sharp edge when done right ... I just need to persevere with learning how to use it. I do not use it with the small folding sharpener and magnetic rod so if that's what you're getting it for you may have a more positive experience."
2,Couldn't make it work,"Sorry, I couldn't make it work. Tried it on a couple of kitchen knives on both my water and oil stones. Couldn't get it tight enough to hold the knife. Wasn't smart enough to figure out how to set the angle adjuster.Threw it away and sharpened my kitchen knives by hand. 'nuf said"
2,Aligner Guide/Blade Clamp,"Although I love DMT products & have all of their Diamond Diafold stones & a ceramic sharpening stick, I am extremely diappointed with this product. Although a great concept, the actual product is very cheaply made & it broke when clamping my first heavy blade (Navy Seal Knife)the angle settings are not marked with numbers, so every time you use it you have refer back to the written instructions to determine which markings refer to what degree angles you are setting. Making it out of metal would be a big improvement. I would not recommend this product."
2,"Good Concept, Bad Execution",Good concept to help those new to sharpening but too bad the execution is just not there. Cheap material means it breaks quite easily. It's not just about how much force is used but also the angle at which you turn the guide. I would have gladly paid another $10 just to have it made in a stronger material.
3,Not as great as I thought it would be,"It works fine but there is not that much variation in the responses. It has too few different areas on the screen so it really does not matter how you shoot, you get the same response. Also, the string on the ball can be very dangerous for a child. My son made a bad swing and the ball wrapped around the club and then hit him on the head. He got a very bad bump and I was glad it did not hit him in the eye. That ended the fun and we have not played it since. Finally this is not really an indoor game. I think it is best set up outside unless you have an indoor sport court. If you hit a slice and the ball misses the screen, you will damage the furniture or walls."
1,dont waste your money,"I have a similar model I bought on e-bay shipped from Crime Stopper warehouse. They wont support it, they refer me to the retailer that sold it to me and or installed it.My biggest gripe is the 2 way pager works one way most of the time and sometimes out of the blue it will receive updates letting me know my doors are unlocked or locked. I bought for the very reason of having a paging remote in case of break-in, no garage and cant see my car from my apartment.When the pager is functioning right I will have a few days to a week before i get a low battery indicator. After changing th battery out the clock on the pager resets and it looses paging function again."
5,built to last a lifetime,"There aren't too many things that you can say these days that you've had for a dozen years and even fewer (mechanical) things you expect to last a lifetime. This stapler happens to be one of them though. Can't imagine them building 'em any better than this. A little expensive but *not* overpriced.I use this at home where my desk duties are pretty light so this Swingline handles tasks of gathering a few sheets of paper together every so often. Even with light usage I can appreciate the quality build even from and aesthetic and ergonomic point of view; looks great on my desk (classic!), and feels great in the hand. Even with my arthritis it's easy to pick it up and with one squeeze it gets the job done effortlessly.Highly recommended!"
3,Very Good follow up,"Was great to have a follow up of the first one. Its fun to watch all the series, then you know how things end. Very Good effects"
2,About what you would expect,"More herpetological havoc ensues when a greedy capitalist (John Rhys-Davies) sponsors misguided scientists into genetically engineering a giant supersnake.I really missed Hasselhoff in this one. Perhaps that in itself is a potent indicator of how far this franchise has sunk. There's still some goofy fun in it if you're in the mood to laugh at a bad movie. Every time the snake appears, it seems to be a different size. I enjoyed the shot of a pit full of bloody corpses that were breathing so heavily that they might have just completed a marathon."
5,Excellent storage in a small package,Easy to carry. Small in size. Quiet. Powers with only one USB plug (also data) on my Lenovo notebook. Respons reliable and fast.
3,teresa's tattoo,"I would actually give it 3.5 stars total.It was funny, the cast was funny, and the storyline was funny, too. Okay, so it may not be like the Odd Couple, but it still ranks close with or ties with American Pie and Dumb and Dumber. This movie is funny."
5,only 8 reviews so far?,"Of course, this book is a classic, and the low number of reviews is only because it was published in the 80s.This book has revolutionized the field of AI, and made Bayesian networks ubiquitous in computer science today (though, BNs were first proposed in 1970 by Suppes or perhaps even earlier).[ Interestingly, Suppes used BNs to deal with causality. ]I think part of this book's originality is the use of a mathematical theory (ie, probability theory) into AI. A similar and earlier revolutionary step was taken by John McCarthy in his use of formal logic in AI.Chapter 5 is actually about what I'd call probabilistic abduction, but the naming of the chapter is a bit misleading.There are now newer and perhaps better texts on BNs, eg: ""Learning BNs"" by Neapolitan, the tome by Koller and Friedman (MIT Press), and Darwiche"
1,Not so much,"I used this text in addtition to a few others for a course in probablistic reasoning (Bayes nets, etc.) and found that it was very unhelpful. The explanations were very poor and many parts were difficult to read. Also, there weren't very many examples and those that were provided were not very detailed. If you're looking for a text to learn probabilistic reasoning I would suggest trying a different book. Pearl's book could be useful as a 2nd or 3rd reference but not for the primary text. 2 thumbs down."
3,Sometimes snappy answers just aren't good enough,"Although some readers seem to have gotten a great benefit from Ms. Berzon's book, sometimes complicated questions deserve more complicated answers. At one point, she argues that a person very likely is born homosexual. And yet, at another, in disputing the use of the Bible to justify bigotry argues that the Bible never discusses sexual orientation. As she says, nothing was known of such things in the ancient world (apparently despite people having in-bred same-sex attractions). Missing is the extensive scholarship revealing how intimately homophobia relates to the development of modern capitalism."
1,Awful,"This so called ""Gala?"" was one of the worst presentations I have ever seen and the audience must have been paid, the way they stood and applauded this third class ""Gala?"" I wish I could return it for a refund."
1,Needs 3D video accelator card,"I could not download game, upon futher investigation I learned you need a 3D accelator card, which I have checked into but refuse to spend an additional $80-135 to play one game that cost under $20. That should have been clearly stated that you may need additional accessories to play. I dont know how much fun the game is because I could not play it, I am returning it."
1,Unable to Open,"The game would install, but not open. After several attempts to uninstall/reinstall/restart computer...the same error message continued to appear. We were unable to play, but have opted to exchange in hopes for better luck next time. Watch for review #2."
3,Surprisingly Fun,"Perhaps my expectations were low, but for $19.99 I found it to be a pretty good deal. There's a wide variety of survey questions and the customizable feature allows you to create some pretty ridiculous looking families. If you're a big fan of the show, you'll most likely be a fan of the game."
1,TERRIBLE,"This game was NOTHING like what I expected. The grafics stunk, it was slow and VERY outdated. Sorry I wasted my money on it. AND I understood it was ""new""...it was NOT new! I will never buy from them again."
3,My son and I have fun with this!,"The game is fun, but the graphics are really bad. We still have trouble figuring out the teams. But we love to guess the answers!"

1,I bought two games and they both did not work.,"I had trouble with one Family Feud so I bought another thinking that it may just be a deffective game, but both of them would not work. Verry disapointed in this product."
2,I'm really disappointed in this version,"I'm not a computer game player, but this is one game that I would take the time to play when I get the chance. I've been really diappointed in this game so far in that, like another said, you have to have the precise spelling or phrase to get the answer right. What my problem has been so far though is during the fast money phase of it. Not only do I not get the top answers, which I can live without, but I'm getting buzzed by an answer that is so far from the one originally given. For example, the question was ""name some color you wouldn't want to color your house"". I said Yellow the first time, Blue the second. I got the buzz. How are yellow and blue remotely the same. Yet when asked ""what does the statue of liberty represent?"" I put ""Flame"" & ""Freedom"" for my two answers. I can see how the computer might mistake the two ""F's"". But blue and yellow???If I could do it again, I'd buy the online game before purchasing this one."
2,bad graphics! buggy!,"stick with atari! this is buggy and the graphics are from 1998-some times you give an answer that is correct, and it will buzz you out- its just bad- hate itand in the final round it will say the answer was already given when it wasn't? you will run out of time and can't even finish the stupid game- glad it was cheap."
1,awful,The game was hard to play. I have played the HP version of this game andit was great. I purchased this one thinking it was along the same lines.Boy was I wrong. Waste of money. Not fun at all.
5,Worth it for Pet Sematary alone...,"While the remixes are quite lame in my opinion (You might like them if you like electronic music), the live video of Ich Will that you can watch on your computer and the cover of ""Pet Sematary"" more than make up for it. ""Pet Sematary"" is a tribute to Joey Ramone, who recently died.Amazon.com doesn't seem to have the tracklisting yet, but here it is:01. Ich Will (Album Version) (3:37)02. Ich Will (Live) (4:17)03. Ich Will (Westbam Mix) (6:20)04. Ich Will (Paul van Dyk Mix) (6:13)05. Pet Sematary (6:31)06. Ich Will (live CD-ROM track) (4:20)Make sure to get this if you are a Rammstein fan!!"
5,Great book despite the flaws,"Good editors must be hard to find. :) Still, the book is very good. More technically oriented than the Lammle book, which is very helpful if you want to learn by understanding rather than by memorization. I used this book, the Lammle and some time practicing on routers, and passed the exam today. Despite all the errors in the book (including the ones that didn't get posted on Cisco's Web site), it's very useful. The practice questions on the CD are a big help, too."
2,Too many errors,"Lots of good, dry information. Too many errors, too rushed, better then Osborne, but a worse book then the Sybex book. I also liked the Cisco ICRC, but that had a lot of errors too. Buy more then one book for CCNA, and practice on routers."
4,This book is great but not enough to pass the CCNA test,"This morning I passed the CCNA test successfully and would like to review this book. This book covers all topics for the CCNA test except ATM, VLAN, ISDN and switching. To cover the rest you need to buy the self study kit from the cisco website which comes with a book and a CD ROM (100$). If you learn these 2 books I am sure you can get the CCNA cert."
4,Yeah MON!,"I am a Professional in the I.T industry for 10 years and an associate lecturer for 6. I also have worked on several large scale projects and am trained in or exposed to many gobal trends. Believe me, if you have a clue of what networking is about and you want this certification, get this book. In my opinion, this book is quite relevant and a good source of preparation for this exam, the CD needs some work though. If you don't like the book, take the class instead! It's not Wendell's fault!I not only have the book ... I'm keeping it!"
3,Good but very misleading....,"This book is very good, but with it's title one would expect it to be a Cliff's Notes type of book that breaks down all aspects of the test. While it does do a good job of giving you most of the information you need to take and help pass the test, it does not cover everything in enough detail and also does not have anything dealing with Switching and ATM's. Two things which were added to all Cisco exams in 2000. Also this book has a tendancy to cover areas not needed or covered on the test which may lead to some confusion in some individuals. Overall however, this book did about an average job in preparing for the CCNA exam. If you are purchasing this book in preparation for the exam, you should look into buying other books as well if not attend some classes."
1,Save your money...,"Don't rush out and buy this one. Someone was in such a hurry they didn't even pass it though QUALITY CONTROL. Normally Cisco Press books are very good, but not this one. The CD does not work. The directions state to use small font, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't work with either."
2,Well...,"I bought this book less than a month ago and read it soon after. Even after rereading the Amazon.com summary of each story, I can barely remember anything at all about each story. Draw your own conclusions as to how good this book of 3 stories is. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I did remember a few details."
2,Keep shopping,"We purchased this product as a replacement for our previous 5 quart machine. The old one lasted about 7 years with moderate use. Kitchen Aid had discontinued replacement parts.When we unpackaged the new processor, we were hesitant at the size. It was twice as large as the previous. After multiple uses however, we found this processor has one major flaw, cheese. The unit uses a spin up processes and you must wait for it to reach max speed. We have tried many different vegetable combinations with out fail. However, any type of cheese and it will lock up. Even feeding it slowly will stop the grader. I question the size of motor the unit is using.We own numerous Kitchen Aid appliances. Unfortunately, I would tell anyone interested to stay away from this unit. It doesn't live up to the product name."
3,Angie,"I have to say Im not impressed with it. I excepted more and I feel like Kitchen Aid did not deliver. I have always taken care of it the way it stated in the manual, and still there is a broken piece on the lid where it connects to the handle. it does not hold liquids I tried to make butter in it and that was a mess I was never able to achieve butter, probably because it was all over the counter. It does not have the power I expected, it gets bogged down when im grating cheese. I loved my kitchen aid mixer but I would'nt spend the money on this again if I knew than what i know now I would go out and by a cheap one Im sure it work just as good for maybe longer."
2,frustrating!!,"I replaced a Cuisinart food processor with this Kitchenaid model. The bowl becomes stuck on the base of the processor, and is very difficult to remove. This usually happens when I have the ""stick"" to which you attach the slicer blade to the base. It usually takes brute force wedging a screwdriver or other flat object under the base of the bowl to remove.The other complaint I have about this processor is that although the handle is white on the outside, it is clear on the back side and open to the bowl. So all kinds of groaty things get stuck on the inside of the handle and turn black. It's very unappetizing.Next time, I'll got back to Cuisinart."
3,Versatile,"I love that it has two different size bowls; however, if I mix anything pourable, it leaks out through the middle hole - not much capacity."
2,Very disappointed,"I bought this in September and have used it a half dozen times, very quiet does a great job shredding and chopping BUT, even though the capacity is 9 cups, when you use it for sauces, salsas and liquids, you have to do it in batches (not convenient at all) or you get leaks through the center hole. The center spindle is way too short. I bought the processor for the purpose of using it mostly for liquids and I am completely disappointed it doesn't work for my needs. I also just discovered that it needed to be returned within 30 days of purchase so I can't even exchange it for something I can use......"
2,Disappointed fan,"I have long been a kitchen aid fan and am very disappointed in this processor. I have a relatively new machine with light use, but beyond warranty, and the large plastic bowl broke while chopping tomatoes. One minute it was fine, then a piece broke from the handle. Now the handle falls apart and I must hold it just so in order for the machine to work. I wouldn't call this durable. I have also been dissatisfied by the short center post that allows fluids to leak when the bowl contains just over an inch of food. Bad design! I regret having bought this appliance and do not recommend it."
3,OK for fine-cutting and slicing jobs,"...but doesn't do coarse chopping too well. Useful item to have in kitchen, but a bit overpriced for its functionality."
4,Food processor adequate,"I bought this food processor because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports. I was a little hesitant after reading some of the reviews on Amazon.com but decided that I could live with the problems indicated. As the reviews had noted, the slicer is very thin, and I wish another, thicker, slicer were also available. It is difficult to get all the food in the feeding tube sliced -- some of it usually remains unsliced and whirling around the top of the slicer. I had to learn to handle the processor with a bit of force to attach and loosen it. It is not for those with weak or arthritic hands. The tiny bowl on top is of limited usefulness and I usually end up using only the large bowl. The blades are very sharp so be wary. All in all, though, the machine is a good one and I use it almost daily because, even with the hassle of washing all the parts, it saves much time and energy."
2,Beware large bowl won't hold liquids,"I am very disappointed. I just bought this 9 cup food processor from amazon and the large bowl will hold very little liquid without leaking all over the motor. I can't believe with all kitchenaid's experience that they made a product like that - how am I supposed to puree my soups? They really need to put out a replacement bowl for this and do it right. And they should ship it to us for free, too. This is not up to kitchenaid standards, and is an awful design on their part. I can't use a larger processor, I don't have the room for it. The rest of it works fine, but this lack of design for the main, large bowl is inexcusable. Of course Amazon is the greatest, it came earlier than expected and in great shape - I do love Amazon and always look to them first when I am ready to buy something."
2,Poor value for money,"It took me about 2 days to realize that this particular model was a bad bargain. I wanted a medium sized unit with versatility so I thought that the two sizes of workbowls included with this model would constitute a nice middle ground. Boy was I wrong!Kitchen Aid really needs to wake up when it comes to meeting the needs of customers who don't need or want large scale appliances. The housing of the KFP740 isn't any smaller than the one used for the 12-cup models so takes up just as much counter or cabinet space. On the other hand, it has only a standard mouth and a thin (2mm) slicing disk. I discovered that I could either could pay less money and get the larger model with a wide mouth cover, more discs, and a storage unit or pay $65 extra to get standard 4mm slicer and the wide mouth cover for this unit.Even considering the return shipping charge, I decided that a 7-cup competitive unit with both the wider mouth and a medium slicing disk was a better bargain."
2,Opening in bottom of bowl,I would not have bought this item if I realized that you can only put a small amount of liquid in the bowl. The blade sits on a shaft that is open and therefore liquid will leak out if you try to remove the bowl from the processor. This was not the case with my last processor so I never realized I needed to worry about this. I can't believe anyone would design an item like this.
3,Kitchenaid food processor,"received my Kitchen aid food processor yesterday, -can't use it due to differing US v Aust voltages . any suggestions?? Don't want to return as it looks wonderful, & as you sell to Australia ,you must have seen this problem before. Would appreciate your imputGwen M"
5,MAKES MEAL PREP FASTER,THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL - IT MAKES CUTTING UP VEGGIES SO FAST! CLEAN UP IS FAST AND EASY ALSO!
1,Capacity is 2 cups - not 9!,"A food processor should be able to handle liquids as well as solids. This ""9 cup"" bowl can only handle 2 cups of liquid due to the short center stem! It is obvious that the engineer(s) that designed this has no concept of how it might be used. Someone who sits in a lab but has never entered a kitchen."
1,Not satisfied.,"After months of taking this product, without any noticable benefits, I decided to check it out on the Consumer Lab web site. The site states the product ""Only had 2% of expected minimum amount of ginsenosides and less than 10% of claimed amount."" I will not be purchasing this product again."
4,Panax Ginseng,Great Product easy to use and works very well. I tried many pill forms of Ginseng with fair results the liquid forms just seems to work better and last longer.
1,"broken bottles, drenched cartons","Bought and received two boxes of 22 year panax ginseng extract bottles x 30. Five of those bottles were broken, which would not have been so bad if the contents of those bottles did not then spread all over the box making the entire shipment sticky, and nasty. Had to take them all out, wash them and then could not use the container they came in for storage. So even though I was technically out five bottles out of 60, the ensuing mess makes it very difficult to use what was left."
5,supper food,"this-22 year old ginseng is a good supper food ,that is the number one male toner , great for brain food and gives energy to the body ,i love this product cus its a water extract.thank you"
4,Very good book - but not for beginners,"I found the book very readable and the exercises to change the code in the book challenging. The material is a bit dated today given the move to managed code, or use of DirectX or OpenGL dnd other engines to build games. I found the text explanations of the code to be fair and the programs understandable. There could have been more explanation of what is going on in the beginning but a good programmer should be able to figure it as they progress through the chapters. The prerequiste for the book is a knowledge of C++ and Windows programming. The author tries to get into details of Windows programming but I think most programmers should have done some reading and coding from a book such as Petzold otherwise I don't see how you can do any of the exercises. I highly recommend for anyone looking to do Windows Game Development using free compiler tools such as Dev-C++."
1,Do not buy this book if you are trying to switch from text to 2d games,"Do not buy this book if you are trying to switch from text to 2d games. I got it, saw that it was a compilation of cut-pasted code with hardly any explanation, packed it up in 15-20 minutes, and am waiting for a refund. The code is barely explained. The author uses a simple engine that you use, and does not explain it. The author's sample programs from the book, on his website, crash or are bugged. I have no idea how this book got anywhere near 5 stars. If you need code explained like I do to learn, do not buy this book. However, Michael Dawson's ""beginning c++ game programming"" even though only for text and not 2d, is better than this 10x over."
4,the ups and downs,"I have a 96 Z28 camaro with 124000 miles. The lowering was not as much as I thought, but it could be due to the fact that they have not settled yet. But the ride is better than it was, which I wasn't expecting, and the handling is also better."

3,For beginners only,This book certainly offers a good jump start for beginners but if you're beyond the introductory level there's not much you can learn here. The focus is very much on teaching your dog how to navigate obstacles but there's little on advanced handling techniques and how to practice them.The section on building your own equipment looks quite good but for people like me who can hardly handle a hammer it's probably better (and less nerve wrecking) to simply shell out the money and order ready-to-use equipment.
4,Very intergrated!,"This is an excellent book to use for planning in the elementary classroom. There are many lesson ideas, in all subject areas, including physical education, music,and even field trips! The character letters are terrific for early childhood...the kids love them!"
1,This is doesn't seem to be a real product,"Somehow Amazon has managed to put a title referring to a Reflector Telescope, a picture of an enormous Meade reflector but coupled it with nonsensical data such as a completely incorrect weight and details pertaining to what seems to be a 90 mm REFRACTOR. Might be a good idea to double check and/or proofread your item descriptions, Amazon. Jeez."
4,review of commitment and revenge,"This is a Christian book written by a devout Christain. Simply put, it is about the struggle between good and evil. It reminds the reader that the Lord will love and support anyone who believes in him and cries out to him for help. In these troubled times, the book reminds us that peace and forgiveness, is mightier than the sword. The exciting plot centers around a main character, William Smith, who finally comes to the realization that he will never overcome his anger and hostility unless he forgives his enemies, and erases the revenge from his heart. Along the way, the dialogue is colorful and the characters have believable voices. Each one affects the outcome of the book in his/her own way. The intrigue and suspense holds the reader's interest and is entertaining from beginning to end. The story is not only exciting, but morally uplifting, I would recommend it to readers of all ages who are looking for an exciting and inspirational story."
3,Ups and Downs,"Generally entertaining, though someone has to teach the author to be a bit more consise. Drags on endlessly in places. Some genuinly gripping parts, if you have the patience.One thing almost ruined this book for me. The author has an incessant crutch. One word is utterly used utterly too often. It's utterly ridiculous how utterly often the auther falls back on this utter word. Almost utterly laughable after a point. I'll leave you in utter confusion as to what this word might be. It's not entirely the author's fault, either - whoever edited this book ought to be fired. A decent storyline utterly compromised by such an utterly irritating crutch.That said, it was good enough that I'll probably finish the trilogy, just to see what all the fuss at the end is about. Part of me resents reading a whole book that serves no purpose but to set up another, but such is the publishing biz these days."
3,"It's not terrible, it just drags on","The main problem I had with book two was that it went on forever. There was a lot of time dedicated to getting to the actual plot point, and the action scenes had a lot of build up, then very little actual action.Great and terrible things happened very quickly and sometimes out of nowhere. The book was so similar to the first one that I feel as though there isn't really a point in continuing the series, because it will be more of the same.The characters all maintain their personalities from book one and what could have been some serious introspective moments really just got brushed over in favor of more lines of text.Don't get me wrong, it's still a good story, but I feel like it needed more direction."
2,Needs Editing,The second book in this trilogy is disappointing.I found myself skimming through many sections. The conflict between Damien and the Hunter looses its effect when gone over in every chapter. The hunter being afraid of this new evil should create a feeling of terror in the reader but it is mentioned to many times. The book has potential but needs editing to find its pace. I found the religious ideas interesting. The idea of faith creating a god is a new concept for me but it can be true on Earth and Erna.
3,"Not as good as ""Black Sun Rising""","Overall, ""When True Night Falls"" is not a bad follow-up to ""Black Sun Rising,"" the first volume of The Coldfire Trilogy. This novel is more plot-driven that its predecessor, and thus lacks the emotional and psychological intensity of the earlier book. Also, the plot was simply not as lucid as ""Black Sun,"" crossing the boundary of 'inventive' into the world of just 'weird'--a shift that is completed in the concluding volume of the trilogy, ""Crown of Shadows."" Worth reading as the sequel to a truly great sci-fi novel, but that's about all. If you MUST have closure, read this whole trilogy; if you are simply interested in reading a brilliant novel, stop after the first book"
4,Action filled return to Erna,"I picked up this book shortly after I had read the first because I hungered for more. Granted this book isn't without its shortcomings and I felt that some scenes were a bit out of place I still enjoyed my return to this world. I don't feel that this book is as dark and brooding as the first, but it still made me think."
1,Skip this one. Nothing happens anyway.,"Not just the weak link in the trilogy, it's the missing link. The Damien and the hunter wander all over the land trying to find the bad guy. They finally reach his headquarters only to find that he has moved on ahead of them. This is a wild goose chase, not a story!Along the way, there are endless descriptions of the terrain and some folks die. And Damien still makes speeches disapproving of the Hunter, like he can't get over it by now ... ?This book doesn't advance the story line, deepen the characters' relationships, or reveal secrets. It just counts sheep."
4,Good Seriel,"This was one of the most interesting series of book I have encountered in quite a long time. The characters are well developed with unexpected twists occuring throughout the story. The story line is unique, well laid out and not always predictable. I will certainly look for more works by this author. My only complaint is the the climax of the story seems to come very quickly after a length build up. A little like se......"
4,A great continuation,I thought this book wasn't as great as the first one but most of my friends liked it more. I would definitely recommend it if you have started Black Sun Rising already because you simply can't stop after one book. It was as detailed as the first and as captivating.
1,Skip this book unless you're a completist,"It's a good series, but this book's definitely the weak link--the villain's cardboard, there's a Tarrant scene that contains one of the all-time goofiest over-the-top 'thank you my pale lover, for the ecstacy you bring in death' lines I've ever read, and there's a death of a major character that's jarringly random, unfair and poorly-done. Besides all that, it's disturbing to realize that, even more than in other books, it's VERY VERY BAD LUCK to be a female character in this book. The gender wonkiness of this author is pronounced enough to be a good subject for a master's thesis, but it's at its most pronounced here."
4,Good overview of professional's analytic factors,"If you can make it though the Capitalist dogma chapter at the beginning, you will find a good list of factors that professional traders use to evaluate stocks, mutual funds, options, etc. Defines many types of investment vehicles and suggests where they are useful."
4,A good diamond sharpener,"Other than what seems a steep $100 price, diamonds are the way to go for sharpening chisels. The large size is really nice. The two grits are good for general chisel sharpening."
5,"Pricy, but does a great job","I was skeptical at how well this would work, but I had not found a anything that would sharpen a blade to my satisfaction. I like that is sharpens very fast, puts on a fine, sharp edge. Yes, it is very expensive, but for those who appreciate sharp knives in the kitchen, I think this is a must have. I find myself much more willing to sharpen my knives with this device than others (most which I was dissatisfied with the sharpness)."
4,Fantastic,Dmt sharpening stone is the best for all knives. It takes less than half of the time to Sharpen knives than other stones. I m loving it... But the only thing I can't understand is he colors black and blue... It's not easy .. But it is brilliant stone to have... Now I hv sharp knives all the time...
5,DMT diamond sharpener,"Fantastic product. Beats sharpening stones hands down.I will purchase the extra fine/extra coarse stone soon.Would definitely buy the base to go with the stone.Its about 4"" wide which makes it useful for plane blades."
1,Maybe one star is too many,"I ordered this for the one song I heard on the radio, Going Home, familiar to most from Dvorak's New World Symphony. Unfortunately it was not possible to listen to samples, and, except for two or three others which are not painful to listen to, the rest of the album is rather terrible. The songs from Porgy and Bess are marred by what must be the most grating soprano voice I have ever heard recorded, and a big chunk of the album is devoted to some obscure Broadway production which is justly obscure--some of the most boring music I have ever heard sung. The pity is that Going Home is at the end, so I can't just listen to that one and cut the rest off, so it's either fast forward through the whole album to get to it, or never listen to it or download it on my computer and pick out that song. But I am not one to listen to music at the computer."
5,Ahoy There Little Polar Bear,"""Ahoy There Little Polar Bear"" is a story about a polar bear named Lars who lives in the north pole. One day, Lars swam out too far in the water and got his foot stuck in something. It was a net and it reeled him up and onto a fishing boat. Onboard, he met Nemo, the ship's cat. Nemo was willing to help Lars get back to the north pole, so when the ship docked at the next port, Nemo took Lars to see some other cats. They decided that Lars should get on one of the ships that was leaving for the north pole the next day. So they sneaked Lars onboard early the next day and soon Lars was back in his home at the north pole.I think that this is a very good book because it is quite interesting. It can keep a reader's attention during the whole book I believe. The book has a cool plot with neat characters and good description. Lars is a fun character that is interesting just to hear about."
5,Great book - my son just loved it. Good to read!,"All these polar bear books have a very happy ending. The drawings are beautiful, there is no violence or blood. The bear seems to get into trouble, but there are always other kind animals that bail him out."
2,I really wanted to like it . . .,"Del Amitri is one of my absolute favorite bands, and I was salivating in anticipation for this CD to arrive. However, this CD just doesn't measure up to their previous releases. I guess I'm partial to the more acoustic sounding songs, and they're just not well represented here. If you're expecting to hear ""Downfall"" or ""Nothing Ever Happens"", you won't find it here. If you're a fan, buy it because it's probably the last chapter. I just don't think this CD is going to earn del amitri any new fans."
3,"My Favorite Band, But Not Their Best Work","This is a good Del Amitri CD, but it lacked something that I can't quite put me finger on. I think it's that a majority of the songs are simpy good and not great (a first!). However, if you're a fan (and I wish there were more of us out there, so that the Dels wouldn't be currently without a record label) you MUST buy this, even though it costs a little bit more. If you're just a casual listener and are looking for something beyond the obvious hits collections, go buy ""Changes Everything""."
4,Give it your undivided attention...,"When I first heard this disc, I have to admit that I was painfully dissapointed. I must be Del's most avid fan, but the first few listens to this CD forced me to question why I had even shelled out the money. However, as I listened more and more, I began to hear the same old Justin Currie that I'd always heard...deep words, great tunes...though different than what I have heard from them before. ""Buttons On My Clothes"", ""She's Passing This Way"", and ""Just Getting By"" are amazing and powerful songs. There are one or two junk songs, which seem to appear on every Del CD, but can be easily skipped over by the touch of a remote. This album is excellent and it blows me to pieces that after 20 years these guys can still produce unparalled music. Whoever is bitching about Justin possibly getting out of the business: who can blame him after so long? he has surely left his impression."
3,What happened?,"Del Amitri, and Justin Currie in particular, entered our world as one of the best songwriting talents of the 1990s but somehow, it all went flat. The band remain for me one of the best live acts I ever saw- was it 1991? - but slowly but surely, after Waking Hours, the songs became less musical, less lyrically enthralling, and just plain AOR. A decade later I think maybe the business just chewed them up but man, something went awry and this wonderful, fresh, adult-thinking and lyrically-relevant band became an ordinary, pleasant, rock and roll ensemble. I still pull out Waking Hours, I rarely listen to Another Sucker's Parade, and I know this one will be ok for some short period but ultimately consigned to the shelf. Guess it's time for me to kiss this thing goodbye."
3,Can This CD Do You Good ? Not So Sure,"In short, this CD has it's moments some excellent and some less than par.If you were weened on early Del Amitri you may find this disappointing and only a handful of their original flavors carry forward. The drum patterns (loops) are less than exciting and tend to drag many of the songs in a downward spiral. Gone are the exciting percussion riffs by Chris Sharrock and the dynamic spectacular production by veteran Bob Clearmountain.The hammond organ on the opening track offers an excellent opening touch but the CD doesn't hold up as well on the remaining tracks with one exception, ""Out Falls The Past"". This track though light hearted, gleams beyond the majority of the tracks.Although still ardent to a point, this CD can provide mixed emotions to true early Del Amitri fans."
3,"A solid CD, but they're so much better than this...","God, i've wwaited forvever for this CD to come out. There was nothing more exciting than for me to recieve this CD in the mail. I adore del amitri, and I love all their work, but alot of this CD is not the real Del. Alot of the romance and power and somberness is lost behind odd beats and even some really strange lyrics. There are of course so amazing songs, ""Just Getting By"", ""Baby, It's Me"", and ""Buttons on my Clothes"" are excellent. ""Just Before You Leave"" and ""Drunk In a Band"" are pretty sweet tunes, but alot of this CD is much worse than their B-sides (which I must admit are fantastic). I'm a Del fanatic...they are by far the best and most well rounded group I have ever heard, but buy their other seven albums first, and if you adore them, maybe consider this one. I wouldn't buy it just for the music, but maybe to add to your collection. I'm not really panning it, but it could have been more spectacular. I'm so sorry guys, I still love you."
2,A bazillion functions but poorly written,"This book has an enormous number of mathematical functions implemented. Unfortunately, the quality of the code is poor. However, if you buy a copy of A&S, you can use the code as a starting point and it would be faster than writing it from scratch. If you can find the routines you need in the Cephes collection at netlib, I would strongly encourage you to use those instead. On the other hand, there are many routines in this book that I have not seen implementations for elsewhere."
5,where have you been all my life???,"I am a nail polish junkie and I didn't think much of top coats until I bought this. Most top coats I used either took too long to dry or it chipped like crazy. HOWEVER..this beauty gave me a whole new perspective. I LOVE this product. It really does dry your nails within a few minutes. My nail polish coats are usually thick so it take about 5 minutes for the ""Good to Go"" to dry completely. But when it is, there is no smudging whatsoever. Another thing I love about this product is that it seems to give a rubber, plastic shield over your polish. It leaves your nail color looking 5x shinier and keeps it looking perfect until you take it off. This product is a MUST HAVE for any nail polish lover :)"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR,The worst piece of junk I have ever seen that they are trying to call accessories for a Blackberry. The holster doesn't fit the phone and they keep your shipping charges!! That's how they make money because the product is junk!! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!
2,Holster does not work with my Pearl 8110,"Like one of the other reviewers said, the holster does not fit the phone correctly, so it is loose and can fall out easily. I've tried the home charger and it works, mobile charger have not had the chance to try yet. Somewhat of a scam with a holster that's not even designed correctly! I'd like elsewhere for accessories."
1,PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This product is made of the cheapest material I have EVER SEEN!. Please do not even spent one cent on these bundled items. The label on them says made in China (of course), but they are of such cheap, plastic quality, I have never seen before. The cell phone holder does not even fit my Blackberry Pearl 8100, as the top of the holder is off center, and does not ""clip on"" to any part of the phone. Therefore, the phone is ""loose"" in the holder, and can easily fall out. I charged the phone with the car charger, and after 2hrs the phone was still only half charged. I was too afraid to use the wall charger. I think these products might ruin my Blackberry! I will be returning these items, and hopefully I can recieve my money back, and try to find products with better quality!"
3,very good.,"good cd. I really liked it. I liked ""olga lala."" ""patti"" is also very good. I really liked ""now that you're gone."" I'd like to see what the next cd will be like. I recomend it."
5,Good for use as a text or resource for practioners.,"This book is, obviously, a little on the ""pricey"" side, but I look at it this way; a purchase like this is an investment in your career.As a graduate student about to enter the field, I have found this book to be an invaluable supplement I use for reference for my other courses. The writing is accessible, research-based, and well organized."
5,Awesome reading,"Started reading this book one day and could not wait to get home to finish it the next day, very nice twist at the end... will keep an eye on this author."
5,Great First Book!,"This is the first book by this author, and truly I am looking forward to the next. What impressed me most with this novel is how well-developed both the story and the characters were. Either he really nails it when it first puts it down on paper, or he spends quality time in careful revision. Either way, I feel these are signs of a truly professional author at work. Deadly Heirs is a very quick read, but you still get a sense that the author spent a great deal of time on his story and characters. This kind of writing is a pleasure to read and to keep reading when the author's second book is published. This author lives in my local area, and I have it on good authority that a second novel with the same main character, the detective Debarlo, is forthcoming.I love this genre of novels. I love good characters to become attached to. I love to read more books with these characters. I am looking forward to his future books."
3,Nice throw,I got one of these for my daughter and one for me. Actually my little dog sleeps on it. Not quite as thick as I would like it to be after several washings but nice for a throw on the sofa.
5,The next generation of Fatal Fury comes to life..and blows your mind!,"For one of the final games of the original SNK run and one of the few games that SNK touted as a 2-D masterpiece, it is a sure-fire hit. Yes, I said that also about Last Blade 2, but this is its sister game, and boy, is it worth the money. The gameplay is simplified, yet familiar, taking a page out of the Street Fighter Alpha and SF3 series, the characters all have a connection to the days of Fatal Fury Past, the graphics are phenomenal, and the presentation is superb. My only regret: they didn't make a sequel to this or Last Blade 2. Oh well. Making due with these is good enough for me. Get...this...game!"
3,A game more people should have played...,"Fatal Fury: Mark of Wolves - Circa 2001GOOD:- Good Balanced 2D fighter, considered a classic to many hardcore 2D fighting fans- Really nice animations- Finally SNK gets off it's butt and makes a fighting game with graphics that don't look like they belong in a museumBAD:- Graphics might be a little dated for some people- Dreamcast Controller might not be up to the challenge this game providesWILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:- Not over the top like Guilty Gear X/X2, Marvel Vs Capcom, or Capcom Vs SNK- Old School type game play and not combo heavyGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- King of fighters 2000 and up- Street Fighter: Alpha 3ADDITIONAL NOTES:- In the game the fighter Rock is the son of Geese the boss from the old Fatal Fury games and Terry's nemesis- We can only hope SNK will remake this game or make an sequel"
1,They should commit Suicide.,"I listened to one song of theirs on Youtube; it was mediocre, but I decided to get this album anyway. Once I got the CD, I opened it up and looked at the album art. It showed some typical punk-looking sissies, dressed in white, and then sporting some ketchup-like blood. Yeah...I didn't expect much. Even after that, they still managed to go below my expectations."
5,Not My Year MADE my year!,"First of all you have to know that 'Suicide City' consists of 5 amazing & talented people who love what they do. What they do is make great music and put on one of the most energetic shows I have ever seen. This CD is only the beginning. If you are looking for Biohazard, then go buy a Biohazard CD. If you want something fresh & entertaining that has an aggressive sound, and is infused with real passion, then 'Not My Year' is most definately the CD to own. It's a seriously good time."
5,Astounding music,"The music recorded on these piano rolls is truly astounding. Friedman shows phenomenal technique, as well as beauty in playing these pieces. And of course the sound is great since it was recorded using modern technology of off piano rolls. Is it true to Friedman? To hear the live stuff, there are great recordings on Naxos. The playing from these rolls is very dynamic and lively, not like the muted Muzak present on the ""Window in Time"" series for Rachmaninov. I have other Nimbus piano roll CDs, and they seem to have done a very good job in reproducing this music."
4,Great for Beginners,"I found this CD easy to use. I am a beginner and am was impressed by the ease of navigation. The information presented was very helpful and presented in a non complicated manner. I would reccommend this product for beginners. It definitely helped me. The author describes a number of ways to find things to sell on Internet auctions, and I've used his advice and been quite successful with my new auctioning business."
1,It's not worth it!,"I have to agree with the other author who gave this CD one star. It's very amateurish, and looks like it was produced at someone's home. ...you're much better off looking elsewhere for a reference. The samples are very, very basic, and the background does make certain links hard to see. The author should have also used spellcheck before burning the CD. I'm very disappointed!"
3,It's OK ... more for the neophyte,"More for the newbie who has heard of auctions but hasn't started any activity. I thought it was quite well written, and while I'm not a fan of CD-ROM books (I like to read in bed), it was easy and quite pleasant to read. My quibble is that (to me) the information was nothing new, in fact it all seemed pretty much common sense - do your research, buy cheaply, use a bit of HTML (two rather basic templates are included), be polite to customers. It may be useful, but a few hours spent browsing on eBay are cheaper!"
2,A Major Disappointment,My problem with this VCR is that it is advertised to be a stereo VCR but mine is not. I have tried hooking it up with both RCA jacks and the coaxial cable. Neither has worked. I have also checked the audio-processor setting to no avail. My television is hooked up through my receiver. When the mono switch on my receiver is pushed in you can tell a dramatic difference with the television. Not so with the VCR. Also my television has a light on it to let you know when it is receiving a stereo signal. It does not receive a stereo signal from the VCR. This is not just with tapes but also the VCR's tuner. I have tried many different tests and I am sure that the VCR is not producing a stereo signal. Unfortunately I did not notice this until I had owned it about four months so returning it is not an option. My next step is to contact JVC. The next VCR I buy I will immediately check to see that it is actually putting out a stereo signal when applicable. This is an easy problem to miss!
1,Rip-off Haestad Methods Book,"I ordered the Haestad Methods Computer Applications in Hydraulic Engineering, Sixth Edition (CAIHE) in hardcover. ($250.00).I received a 48 page ring-bound photocopy of CEU workbook problems. To say I am not impressed is an understatement."
5,OEM quality belt,"I bought this belt to replace the one in my 1992 Acura Legend. When I took off the original OEM belt, I could tell this Gates is better. The rubber is actually a blend of nitrite which is more chemical and heat resistant. The price is about the same as my dealership, but I hate dealer with dealerships. Since Gates is OEM for many cars, I trust them."
2,"Easy to fill up, easily lets air out","This ball is great, except when you try to use it. I filled the ball up the first day, and the second day it was nearly flat. I eventually put it up in a closet, and now cannot locate the air pump or stopper that came with it. These pieces are so small and easy to use. Now this ball is useless."
1,NOT FLAT,"this stone was not flat. when i put it on a glass surface, one corner sticks up. that makes it useless for sharpening, which bad because this is a 'sharpening stone' and has no other function. it should at least be manufactured in such a way that it does what its made to do...UPDATE - I did get a replacement from Amazon and have been using the two sided stones (extra course/course + fine/extra fine) with excellent results. I see no reason to try any other brands or sharpening systems. I suggest you confirm that you get a 'flat' stone by putting it on a glass table to make sure it sits flush on all corners. Once you confirm that it is indeed a flat surface, then its a great tool."
5,A Must Have for Your Collection,"If you have an interest in baseball statistics, this is the book for you. This book uses several new metrics to analyze the performace of baseball's best and rank them more accurately than ever before. It is compact, concise and easy to read. I strongly recommend it."
5,personal appeal,"interesting and well documented first person reports on events of a sorry time.. A dear friend has a chapter devoted to him, so I really appreciated the book."
5,Love these dolls!,"Used to get these every year growing up, now getting them for nieces. They are still very sweet and little girls love them!"
5,Hits Of Metallica Vol. 2 - Karaoke CDG Songlist:,Contains 7 Songs With AND Without Lead Demonstration Vocals (14 Tracks Total).1. Whiskey In The Jar2. The Unforgiven3. I Disappear4. Fade To Black5. Hero Of The Day6. Stone Cold Crazy7. Nothing Else Matters
4,Solid executable strategies and ideas,"This book was great as a 'kick in the butt' type motivator. It really has nothing fancy to offer, but rather details the benefits and just going up to and meeting women. Part of the problem, of course, is that if you can do that, you probably have no need for such a book.Useful strategies were given and I got many new ideas from this one. It's nice, light, and worth a read."
2,Do You Love Me! (Now that I can Dance...?),"I have to dock this guide 2 stars just for its assertion that those who do the dancing, do the prancing. In other words, if you can't dance, or don't enjoy dancing, forget the whole thing?! Claustrophobic cultural elitism. (I didn't notice anything similar in the companion volume, ""How to Meet the Right Man"").Docked one other star for being too mainstream. Other than these two bridge-outs, there's much good advice that mainly would assist those sincerely looking for bonafide relationships, but I feel it still isn't really aimed at everybody."
3,Too Long,The description stated that the bracelet was 7.25 inches and when it arrived it was actually 8.0 inches.
5,It's up to Speed to recover Pop's stolen Plans to rebuild m5,"This was the first episode of the cartoon Speed Racer.Speed has to out wit Ace Ducey and his gang. He enters the Sword Mountain Race to win 5,000 bucks so Pop's Racer can re-build the mach5 race car engine.Speed and Duggery take a short cut during the race to keep Ace Ducey and his gang at bay. They mistakenly drive their cars right into the path of a volcano. Can Speed get out in time? Will Speed save Duggery? The fast paced action involves Speed, his girl Trixie,& Pop's in a chase to recover the mach 5's stolen plans. episode also shows off the mach 5s' devices."
1,Rehash,"At first I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Reading the many reviews on various martial arts forums, I was anticipating this information like never before. After opening the book and reading through the many ""accolades"" of the author, I started thinking that perhaps it was written in order to congratulate himself. I found nothing new in terms of strength training principles, other than a few references to indian club training that any earnest internet researcher can readily found out. This book was written to appear like it contained new information, but a simple internet search will give the seeker more clear cut information without the hype."
5,For serious students of strength,"I have been associated with the field of strength nearly 50 years, in the capacity of competitor, coach, writer and historian, and during this period of time I've read many books about the subject. But this book stood side by side with the best I have ever read. Scott Sonnon has taken an old idea and brought it bang up to date and anyone following his instruction will no doubt become a much better, fitter strength athlete. The author also looks at the history of his methods, making this a very well researched volume and highly recommended reading."
2,Second time around,"I have had the spacemaker undercounter can opener for four years and really never liked the way it operated. The blade finally broke and I needed another one to replace it so I chose the same model, only because I like the way it looks under the counter and it will fit into the already existing holes in the cabinet. Black and Decker should test this product more extensively before selling it. The guide never guided anything and the blade never operated correctly on irregular shaped cans. I am sorry that no other brand fit in the existing holes because if they did, I would not buy this model. This is the only product from Black and Decker that I find fault with."
1,Don't even think about it!!,"Black & Decker -- Shame On You! This can opener hasn't worked right since after about the first 7 or 8 times. Unfortunately, the period expired when I could return it, and now I'm stuck with it. It's not designed well, but it's very pretty. I bought the thing so I could have clear countertops, and I do, but I can't open any cans. What a disappointing product! If there was a ""minus stars"" I would rate it in that column."
1,Waste of money,"I purchased this can opener about a year ago.Let me tell you,that it is the worst piece of garbage that I have ever bought.It is extremely difficult to open cans with this item.You end up with more food on the floor or counter than you actually consume.Shame on Black and Decker."
1,Black & Decker missed the boat with this can opener,"I purchased this product to replace a 5 year old Black and Decker can opener that was also an under the cabinet model. This new can opener is not nearly up to par with my previous B&D can opener. It is difficult to operate smoothly, a lot of food residue hangs onto the cutter and makes frequent cleaning necessary and the tab that you have to push down to start the cutting operation sticks and is difficult to push back up to shut the unit off. I intend to start looking for a replacement even though I have only owned it for about a month."
3,Looking for an alternative,"We received this can opener in 2000 and have used it once or twice a day for the past 3 years. For the past two months, it will cut 1/2"" into the can, then stop. You have to jerk the can out to reposition the can under the can opener, then you can go another 1/2"". IT would take FOREVER to get a can open this way. I have resorted to my hand held can opener. This can opener is not strong enough to open heavier metal cans (like Pedigree dog food). I need an alternative, don't want to get the same thing after looking over the reviews."
1,Poor choice,"This unit worked for about 5 months, then it decided that it would start dropping cans. Now 3 months later it won't even hold the can or even open it."
2,black,"I recently purchased this product. First the cutting part broke , I then return it. Then the part that you push up and down to operate the opener broke 2 to 3 months after purchase. I have since tried to find a black and decker store to return or exchange to no avail. Please email me the location nearing to me. Memphis, TN 38116, 38134 or anywhere in in Memphis, TN Thank you"
5,Great Storage Bin!,"I have the Nilo N51 Play Table and got this bin to roll underneath. It is a very heavy duty bin on wheels that only roll in one direction. I think that is a benefit since swiveling wheels can get going the wrong direction and be too hard to roll for little ones. I have this on Pergo and even fully loaded she can push it around to get to what she wants. I believe this bin will outlast our need for a storage solution for toys! The white sides are melamine covered, but after a while I will probably put some wallpaper or contact paper to match my decor. Still a wonderful bin!"
5,Very nice watch.,"I couldn't ask for a nicer watch for the money. I had bought an Invicta that was quite a bit cheaper on Amazon and got what I paid for (nice watch but very light weight). This Seiko is the opposite. Nice and heavy, not so heavy that you notice it on your wrist but heavy enough to know it is a solid watch. I have worn for about a month and no scratches on the face yet. I have been swimming with it in a pool and in the ocean and had no problems. If you are looking for a watch in this price range STOP LOOKING and buy this one, you won't be disappointed."
5,Solid elevated surface for the bench stone,I am glad that I bought the bench stone base. I think the elevated surface makes sharpening easier. It holds the stone rock solid and the little rubber pads keep it from sliding. There are plastic tabs that snap in place to remove and replace the stone for a different coarseness or to clean it. I assume that they will not fatigue and snap off. If I get a couple years of use it will be worthwhile. If I get more it is a bargain.
1,"overpriced, not very helpful","I'm starting medical school in a few months, and i first got this book to try to improve my study habits in anticipation of things to come. I have to say that for $30+, this book is overpriced. There is not very much ""info"" or ""tips"" here.. it's mostly just vague repition about studying a lot and testing yourself, and there is no clear study method presented.One of my friends recommended a smaller and cheaper, yet BETTER book called ""How to study in Medical School"".. I found it much more useful, with a clear, defined study method presented, and even more tips for doing well. If you're going to get a book to help you spruce up your study skills for med school, there are better options out there."
3,Not bad to keep you focused,"The suggested techniques for studying and remembering information come out of cognitive psychology and, in my opinion, have a solid basis. The authors provide practical, easy-to-implement techniques for information acquisition, maintenance, and proficiency -- small things like previewing material, condense notetaking, and error analysis on practice exams for self-monitoring your understanding. Of course, none of this is groundbreaking for the bright student, but who couldn't use a focused, concise manual to remind them of effective strategies. If you've got the money, this book is not a waste."
3,"not good, not bad. there are better options","This book is ok, but i agree with the previous post; ""How to Study in Medical School"" is a much better read, and a better bang for your buck regarding med school preparation."
4,Quality piece of equipment,"Easy to use, rejuvinated my kitchen knives and put a super edge on my buck knives. Not for use as backpack equipment but excellent to have in the house or workshop"
5,Definitely worth the money,"Over the years I have owned a number of bench stones. Most were given away because they just didn't measure up. As a result, I spent a very long time agonizing over the decision before I was willing to drop this kind of money on yet another bench stone.I am happy to report that I am dumbfounded. Compared to this, everything else I have ever owned was like trying to sharpen things with a wood rasp. Finally, I am getting the edges on my tools like I read about in the magazines.This is a spectacular product well worth every dime I spent. It lives up to the hype. How often does one say that?This stone is so good, that I decided to skip the water stone experience entirely and also ordered the extra-extra fine instead.I bought the companion base for it. Also, worth the money..."
5,Solid,"I'm a 25 year professional carpenter. I've seen, own or tried just about every sharpening system available. I've used this and the sister 10"" DuoSharp stone constantly for 20 years on the job site. This sharpener is small, lightweight, portable, requires no electricity, no oil, almost indestructible, short learning curve and quickly gives a scarey sharp edge. Quality isn't cheap. Buy it once and you'll never regret it."
5,Period Classic,"If you enjoy Hollywood musicals of the period (1940) this one delivers the whole package. Beautiful girls, great music and a hokey love story.It is around the time of World War 1 and a couple of struggling songwriters played by John Payne and Jack Oakie pursue success and a pair of sisters with a song and dance act, played by Betty Grable and Alice Faye. All were at or close to their best for this one.Pop in the video, get some munchies, turn down the lights and tune out your troubles, if only for an hour and a half and enjoy."
5,Why not a DVD?,"Much has been said regarding this classic Alice Faye film. Most of her movies areavailable, sometimes with difficulty in UK. Why should this brilliant andenjoyable musical adventure not be distributed on DVD. The film may have been madewhen technology was developing but we now have the real media to really see this.Please make it available in this post-dinosaur age."
1,Home Video Gone Bad,"Just finished watching this. Thankfully, I borrowed it from the Library. Take your Uncles worst - no wait, a grade 7 AV club video taping, put it together with cheesy dialogue and you've got this video. When 'the strip' consists of the Travelodge, Circus Circus, Riveria, Slots-of-Fun and the Stratsophere, you know there's something seriously wrong. Stay away from this one...unless you want to see bad footage of a desert highway for 30 minutes.There are way more interesting videos on Vegas out there.It's 45 minutes of my life I won't get back..."
3,good but...,This stainles steel por-scraper is very good for cleaning the inside glass walls of my aquarium. I like this cleaning scraper to much. However the ss blade is thin and if you have not suficient care you bend the blade corners. And the corners of the blade need to be rounded because the risk to get hurted is there if you have not enough care.
5,Hamiltons basis in stats is excellent,"Clive Hamiltons sequel to Growth Fetish, ""Affluenza"", is rich with statistics on the state of Australian debt, spending habits and attitudes. Based on a great deal of research by the Australian Institute and others, perhaps in response to the more rhetorical basis of his last book. And those stats are truly shocking: the majority of Australians are sacrificing rich, fulfilling lives for overworked ones so they can live like the rich.If you've read Growth Fetish you know the questions, in Affluenza you get some of the answers: downshifting, voluntary simplicity and re-engagment with community."
3,Against globalization and the fetish of economic growth,"A book against globalization, but not a run of the mill one. Hamilton deftly connects the counterculture of the 60s and the 70s with the resurgent capitalism of today. He says (and I'm quoting from the spanish translation): ""The counterculture was never a rebellion against capitalism, but against social conservatism, which impeded the advance of capitalism"". I don't share all his views and proposals, but he is an intelligent person that realizes how the exarcerbated individualism brought forward by the counterculture paved the way for the arrival of today's turbocapitalism. Hamilton correctly sees the problem of the west today as not one of poverty but one of abundance, which has left the place spiritually void. One think I would have like to have Hamilton discuss is how his proposal for zero economic growth would affect the third world, whose livelihood depends in many cases on commodities sold to the west."
3,Another utopian alternative.,"I think the basic premise of the book is credible: there is something definitely fishy with our current statistical growth mania and neoliberal political blindness, both from a sustainability and from a conceptual point of view.My disappointment is in the way it is worked out: the book does not carry proofs, statistical data etc. but mainly rethoric, some of it of the old Marxist flavor( last time I read that stuff was over 25 years ago, it has not become better with age ).The weakest part regards the future of work and the alternatives, plainly utopian without again any substantiation.This book will not convince anybody but the already convinced:"
2,Disappointing,"I'm a long-time user of DMT bench stones in all their form factors. Lately, I've been noticing evidence of poor quality control. I just received a coarse flat file and a fine flat file. There are obvious bald areas on these files containing little or no diamond grit. I expected better. Quality control during the manufacturing process is needed to obtain a more consistent and complete application of diamond abrasive on the working surface. I suppose that this is what I should have expected at this price point; I'll be looking for a higher quality product to replace these."
2,Not Impressed,"This book proved a disappointment. One reviewer said ""Jehovah's Witnesses by Professor Edmond Gruss is one of the best documented and most devastating critiques of the Watchtower ever written."" So, after reading and thoroughly enjoying the two books written by Raymond Franz, former Governing Body member, I read this one. But it's little more than a review of other's research. As a literary piece, it's written like a third grade degree essay, offering little critical examination and never really adding anything new. Don't bother with this one!"
1,not enough there.,"No useful information is given. every religion in the world has claim to know when the world will end. everything Jehovah Witnessesss believe is find in the bible everything from the 144,000 in Revelation 14:1-4. To The end of this world."
3,Good but...,"The CD 2000 by Alan Roubik is supposed to be healing music, but since the CD does not contain a booklet with a suitable explanation I never knew if the CD contains music that will improve the health of the listener or if you can use it as a therapist in the form of background music during healing sessions. If the last option is the correct, I cannot say I would recommend it."
4,Just got back from Annapolis,"What a great guide to the city of Annapolis! I loved learning about the city, and I used this guide the whole time."
3,It's OK but ...,"Please don't get me wrong. I really like the story coz it's full of action and most of all, the main character, Alanna, was a heroine who could be the best fighter and also still a woman :). Well, no problem with that.What I don't like about is the romance part. Alanna sounded like an (almost) easy woman. I almost feel petty with George, Poor guy, especially when Alanna get together with Dragon (what kind of relationship is that? Did she even consider George?). Anyway, that's my opinion. If you have no problem with that, Let yourself enjoy the series then."
4,A good choice for teens ages 14-19,"Tamora Pierce's ""Song of The Lioness"" quartet is a good adventure story with magic mixed in. The first book can be read by kids aged 10 and up but the other three books should not be read by the younger pre-teens due to mature content. I liked the characters, mainly Alanna and Thayet, they show girls that women are strong and can do anything they set their minds to."
4,Way Cool!!,"I absolutly LOVED these books, and this is quite an accomplishment, because I'm really picky about my books, but I went through this book in a day!! I can't wait to read 2, 3, and 4!!! Yipee!!!!!!!!~Liz"
2,Song of the lioness series,"These books are very interesting. The story idea I really liked but I didnt like the authors style so much. They do keep you interested while you read them and perhaps appeal to some people. But they are definitely not for young children. I cant believe they put it in the ages for 9-12! I'm 18 and I find the stuff a bit surprising. I mean, Alanna the heroine is rather flirtatious (though it always says she doesnt know how to flirt) and sleeps with several guys through the series. It doesnt go into much detail but still, I would not let my little sisters read it."
5,A correction,"I just want to clear something up. In an earlier review ""A."" stated the order of Tamora Pierce's different series, but she left out the Protector of the small series which comes between The Immortals and Daughter of the Lioness. So the actual order is:1. Song of the Lioness2. The Immortals3. Protector of the Small4. Daughter of the LionessShe also stated that these books would be great for teenage girls who like fantasy. I would be inclined to argue that they are great for ANYONE. Cheers."
1,Very Disappointing....,"I thought about giving these books 2 stars, just to be kind, but decided otherwise once I reconsidered the series. If you want a great romance, read Jane Austen, or a fantasy romance, Robin McKinley is still number one. These novels contain such strong themes for children and if they were supposed to be for older teens, then the author should of spared her audience by writing the novels better. The only book I liked was the first one, Alanna. Again, I emphasize, children shouldn't read these novels if they aren't accustomed to mature themes. What ever happened to valuing honor and integrity?"
2,Goods Books But Not Appropriate for Pre-Teen Kids,"Like other parents, I add my voice that these books are inappropriate for younger readers. Alanna makes sexual choices that are difficult to explain to a pre-teen (and probably a teen if you disagree with a teenager having multiple sexual partners before marriage). The target market listed, 9-12, is right for the reading level and adventure part of the story, but the sexual elements of the books make the target market absolutely inappropriate for most kids of that age."
5,Alanna's great adventures reviewed.,"I really enjoyed this book both times that I read it.These books are better for girls, and for girls that are more matured. Mostly because of it mature content such as Alanna's sex life. But otherwise this book really helped me understand that girls can do more even if they're small (like Alanna). Also I read it in grade 4 and am presently reading it again and I just can't put it down. Tamora Pierce has just recently come back into my vocabulary and her books are all just the same with the heroism you see here. Tamora has a great way of creating the suspenseful scenes you always find. Also she gives you lots of information but enough to let your mind do some as well. Even though they are a particulary short read if you attack them well they're enough of her books to keep you going and going and going.Rebecca M."
5,THE Classic Sheroe,"This series is about a young noble girl in medeival times, named Allanna who is living in the fantasy realm of Tortall. She dreams of becoming a night, something forbidden by her male-dominated country. She and her twin brother switch places which sends her off to the Palace of King Roald where she meets the Crown Prince Jonathan, the King of Thieves, the 'court drunk' and a host of other entertaining characters on her way to becoming a Knight. With Alanna's and Jon's temper, George's calm ways and eventually a beautiful foreign princess and her guards not to mention an evil sorceress-duke, you'll never want to put these books down. Enjoy!"
4,A nice addition to any rig,"I use this for effects processing and to store samples. It's sits next to my synth and my drum machine and provides a nice compliment to that rig. While probably not a must have for everyone it certainly integrates well into my workflow and has really helped me work out some material I was working on. Some of the effects aren't particularly useful to me but I love the flexibility of the KP3. Overall, it's lots of fun, easy to use, and quite strong on it's own. I'm sure if I was inclined I could bang out music on the KP3 by itself."
3,PC trouble,"I'm a music producer and generally use pro effects, I bought KP to play. The sound is better than everybody says, I should say that you must use it without saturating it, but inside its range the audio quality is very good. The driver doesn't work with my HP Windows7 x64, despite what Korg says in the site, so I still can't reprogram it or use it as a midi controller."
3,Odd sized Organizers,"I bought this intending to organize supplies for one of my hobbies. I knew from the description that the organizers (drawers) did not have enough dividers to do what I wanted, but was ready to by different Prolatch organizers to get the job done. the problem is that Prolatch organizers that can be purchased separately are either 2"" or 3 1/8"" high. The ones in this unit (and therefore the spaces for them) are 3"" high. So, you're stuck with what is included."
4,StowAway Utility Boxes,"I was hoping to use this box for micro irrigation parts but the StowAway utility boxes do not have the adjustable dividers. One box has 2 dividers going long ways, which creates 3 long compartments. The other box only has 2 small lips, creating 3 long spaces that could hold round items without rolling?"
3,"Nice design, cheap and flimsy closure","Too bad, really, that the closure (and lid) is so flimsy (wobbly) and cheap. I have significant fears of the thing opening while I'm carrying it. I really like the design and dimensions, it holds a lot of stuff, and the divided pull out organizers are high quality. One bad design decision kinda ruined this for me. Make a sturdier lid and latch and it's a 5 star device. C'mon Plano!"
3,Careful with it,Be careful with this one. Lousy plastic on those clear bins! I tossed a screw driver from my chair to the floor and it broke through one of the clear plastic bins. Other than that it holds my tools great.
4,Nice!,Hubby loved this. Very useful to him. Durable and looks great. Will prob get another as it works well for him.
1,Didnt fit,Didn't fit my oakworks massage chair. Disappointed. Its was way too short. It seems like it's good quality if it fits your chair.
2,Way too small for Any Massage Chair,"Very disappointed in this product. It is way to small to fit any massage chair and I don't get how they can call this a Master Massage Chair Case, when your chair won't even fit in it. If your looking for a good bag to carry your chair, This is not it."
3,Standard sz ??? No bonus wheels...not a total loss....,"Coming out of a Strong Lite case, I was disappointed...HOWEVER, If you place the case upside-down and zipper with moderate difficulty, it will serve it's purpose and only if the chair has wheels allowing you to roll easily by the shoulder strap. See pic.A bit too narrow for the bottom chair bar and definitely way too short to fit the whole chair.At less than half the price of other cases and the seemingly good quality material (of course, only time will tell) it's a good buy if you don't mind carting the chair with the cover upside-down.Also, be aware, it does NOT come with bonus wheels, so either the previous reviewer got lucky or they changed the product. The product info does not state the wheel feature.The bottom footings are made of plastic, so the claim about not having plastic parts is false....though won't matter to me as they won't be touching the ground anyway! Bottom line, you get what you pay for...hopefully!!!LOL"
3,Brake Line Troubles Then Happiness,"At first, the basket wouldn't go onto my bike because of my brakes, but with a little finesse I got it to work. I still have to make sure the basket isn't pulling on any of the lines but it's nice to have the ability to carry more than a backpack would allow."
5,Omaha Apple Tartlets,"These are absolutely scrumptuous! My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship! The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are!"
5,Product,"The perfect sock for my very particular friend. Warm, high quality and functional. Great neurtral color and fits under most dress shoes and boots."
5,Great for bicycling in the rain,"These socks are really nice and exactly what I was looking for. Super comfortable, high quality, and they breathe well. I use them for wet weather bicycle commuting. I love them.They are easy care, too. Machine wash and tumble dry low.These are my go-to socks whenever I'm riding and there is any chance of rain."
3,Too Thick and tight,"These socks are good to wear and walk inside the home. Although the sizes [length] are correct, I feel the socks are quite tight. And they are very thick and heavy. My hiking shoes fit just right and the extra thickness and padding make it extremely uncomfortable for me to wear my hiking shoes. I prefer wearing lighter and less thicker pair [[...]]. Also from the same manufacturer.The socks gets dried pretty fast and does not retain any smell like cotton."
1,Small socks,These must have come in one size and I didn't ralize it. Nice sock and I'm sure they will wear well just not right size.
5,Unparalleled Wit & Wisdom,"""I can resist everything except temptation.""""There is no sin except stupidity.""""It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances.""""It is always with the best intentions that the worst work is done.""These laconic aphorisms are just the tip of the iceberg of Wilde's impressive, yet oftentimes eclectic and nihilistic, use of the English language. Dover gives us 60 pages of brilliant witticisms and axioms to use over and over again for a mere dollar. You can't go wrong. Also recommended - Dover's Shakespeare quotes book for a dollar. Enjoy."
1,Horrible representation of a great live act,"I saw Hank and Co. at Lollapalooza, and believe me, this album is a poor excuse for a live performance. The sound quality is mediocre, the playing is uninspired (with the exception of 'Do it' and 'Out There', which are better than the studio versions), and worst of all it's on one track. You could get away with that if the performance was up to par, but it isn't. Avoid this one at all costs."
2,Disappointed,"Very comfortable but the pair I got is less than durable. I am not hard on my shoes, got the correct size, and only wear them indoors. In just 3 months the stitching holding the top to the side has torn through the suede leaving a hole that continues to enlarge as the suede keeps tearing at the stitch line. I am very disappointed that they lasted such a short time for the price."
5,Comfort at it's best,I have always worn moccasins. My favorites are those that are full deer skin inside and out with hand stitching. They have become more and more difficult to find. Over the years I have tried many different varieties that come close to the deer mocs I have always loved but was never happy. These are the closest thing to what I have been looking for all these years. I highly recommend them.
4,Could cut a better edge.,"This can opener replaced another Black & Decker can opener that finally gave out after 13 years. It is sorely missed and this new one comes in as a good replacement with the single observation that the edge of the can lid that is removed always has a ragged cut edge. Other than that minor drawback to watch out for when you take the lid off the magnet, it's a good can opener. Find it at discount prices and it's worth it."
1,I DO NOT like this can opener!,I had a heck of a time figuring out how to open cans with it; I didn't think the blade assembly was in correctly because it kept coming out. Now that I got it to work the blade assembly falls out with the dirty lid on it making a mess! I got it because of all the positive reviews; now I see there's some negative ones and I wouldn't have purchased it.
2,Label in Food,"I you like tiny strips of the can's label in your food, buy this can openner. Everytime I use this can opener, I have to pick little pieces of label out of my food. It is bad enough that I will probably never buy another Black & Decker can opener again."
2,Black & Heck...this can opener sucks!,"I bought this and immediately had problems with it. I thought I was getting a good deal, but I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. It was not catching to open the cans, then it peeled and shredded the paper around the top, and then when it was scraping the top of the can (because it wasn't opening it) it was filing off tiny bits of metal. And I don't know about you, but I don't want to feed that to anybody. Not even my con-artist sister-in-law. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I called Black & Decker and they are replacing it for free. And when I told them that I just bought it they offered to pay for shipping as well."
2,Hard to use,I've owned this for a few years now and we've always had problems with it. We had to fit the cans just right before it would work. I thought about tossing it in the trash a few times but it finally broke last week.
3,Clumsey and B&D says obsolete!,"I have used the EC1200 for many years. It works well, but getting used to correctly positioning the can takes some practice. Best approach is aim the magnetic as close to center of can as possible.Piercing blade finally became dull and eventually the handle that holds it broke. B&D; website says the product is obsolete (etc). Since the handle and blade are one small, customarily removed item, it would be easy to replace."
2,Can opening problems with this can opener,"I replaced my Black and Decker can opener with this one... The previous Black and Decker was great and opened cans with ease but this one has some serious design issues.1) This can opener requires multiple tries to position the can.2) When the lid has been removed, the can opener should stop. Many times the can opener still runs.3) The blade assembly comes off easily when positioning the can or lifting the lever to remove the can.4) I have found pieces of the can label inside my food.Do not buy this can opener!!!!!!!!"
1,Piece of J-U-N-K!,"We bought this to replace our 25 year old can opener after the blade on it snapped. We looked around and quickly discovered that finding an inexpensive opener was easy but a quality opener was going to be a difficult task.Out of shear frustration we ended up selecting this Black & Decker. At first it seemed ""ok"", but after just a few months we are back to using our old ""manual - hand wind"" opener. The reason is that the top lever is too cheaply made and it flexes. Over time (not much time!) it gets too loose to hold a can anymore. We lock it in place, it spins an inch or two and the can drops onto the counter. Repeat this scene over and over...! At the end, the lid is never (REPEAT - NEVER!) separated from the can - ever!It's back to the hand held and a search of a decent electric continues."
2,Cheap and hard to use,"Many people in my household agree that it is a piece of ""work"" You have to try 3 or 4 times before the blade catches on and it starts to work. More than half the time, when we try to use it, it doesn't catch the can correctly, it just spins."
1,Forget it!,I am extremely disappointed with this model. It won't properly open the cans without my having to lift the cutting device over and over again. I've resorted to using my old manual can opener. I'm trashing it. It's the worst can opener I've ever owned!
3,No way to secure,"Yes, the cover is soft but they are just flat pieces of paper with no elastic and no way to secure them to the headrest. You can't tuck them in and have them stay. The smallest movement means there's no coverage on a portion of the headrest. Since the vinyl on the table is marked from just the smallest amount of facial oil, let alone makeup, I would recommend still using something else to ensure your headrest is protected."
5,The Form 1970 -1979 -- In Great Form!,"The Form 1970-1979 was first printed in 1979 in an edition of 250 copies by Rustie Cook at the Fault Press, Union City, California. Now 25 years later, this 2nd edition, published by Burning Books in 2003, reproduces that earlier work. From the colophon: ""During 1978 and 1979 Melody Sumner Carnahan sent out over 100 copies of the blank form with a brief note to friends, family, and artists she admired. Nearly everyone responded without knowing what, if anything, would be done with the completed forms."" This book contains the forms as they were variously completed by 100 contributors, including Acconci, Baldessari, Cage, Higgins, Kostelanetz, Marioni, Ruscha, and Warhol. A conceptual-art compilation of the highest order."
5,Dixie,"I have been told my Chili is good, but it isn't Dixie. Had to find it out for myself. (I think mine is better), but Dixie is good for canned stuff, and it makes a great 5-way in a pinch."
5,THIS IS A GREAT CD,I was a bit apprehensive when buying this c.d. F**k you all seemed like a strange title but it paid off. The guitar playing is fast but very catchy. The vocals are guttural but this should be expected. These guys also mix their bass guitar well into the mix. It isn't overpowering but you can definitely hear it. The recording is also great. Nattefrost(vocals) said they rarely practice and they throw this stuff together. I can't imagine what they would accomplish if they really did try.
5,Excellent Synthesis of Vedic Astrology,"The Systems Approach to Vedic astrology is, simply put, the most concise and accurate approach to the subject. This book is a summary explanation of the salient features of Vedic astrology and is very ""user friendly.""When I started to study Vedic, I was getting confused by all of the intricacies of various writers, conflicting information on gems and other remedies, which planets are malefics/benefics for which rising sign, which houses are detrimental, etc. David Hawthorne's book cleared all the confusion for me.If you've been getting mired in the muck of Vedic astrology, give yourself a break and get this book. You will quickly learn how to assess a chart, how to spot weaknesses (and what to do about them), and how to generally predict trends for the future. The example charts at the end of the book are excellent and illustrative of the principles of Systems Approach."
1,Not user friendly,"I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that this book is user friendly. I found it too short and badly written. Many sentences are clumsily phrased and incomprehensible. Basic concepts are explained so perfunctorily (i.e. in one or two short sentences) that it's often impossible for a novice to understand what's being said. I appreciate the authors' efforts to present a streamlined and logical version of Vedic Astrology, but I wish they had presented it in a more digestible form.I think this book may be adequate for someone already familiar with Vedic concepts, but otherwise the authors' inscrutable prose will, I fear, defeat many beginners (like me)."
5,More Dora items in my house.......,"Well, I happen to find this toddler bedding set a little pricey for my three year old. However, I decided to purchase it because she saw it on Amazon.com while I was surfing one day. I ordered it from Target.com. I used it as an incentive to get her to sleep in her own bed. Has it worked? Nope...but nevertheless she likes it and it makes her smile for the $40 price.In addition, the ""comforter"" is slightly larger than her toddler bed, which in my opinion is great. For some odd reason, I thought the blanket would be slightly cheesy, but it isn't...it seems to be of good quality, however of course it isn't as nice as one of those plush blankets...."
4,poor packaging,"Video card worked great. No problem installing card. Package arrived in opened condition. Package had been opened, so don't know if item was used or returned. Although the card worked out very good."
5,Excellent card for older AGP 8X slots.,"&#2951; Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150;&#1150; Highly recommended with warm fuzzies!I bought this to drive a new 22-inch LCD screen at its native 1680x1050 resolution since the 4-year old Nvidia GeForce4 card did not support that resolution. Afterwards, I updated to the latest Nvidia driver version 93.71. Runs all applications and games (on Windows XP) fast with no glitches or problems."
2,"work great, for less then a year","Have 8 of these to use with a hot-shoe flash. They worked great for a year (maybe 20 charges at most), then they pretty much died and won't hold any charge. Better then disposables but still disappointing."
1,Agree with comments that it's not good for digital cameras,"These batteries have phenomenally high self-discharge rates, going so far as to be ""dead"" after 10-20 shots in a digital camera (and no more than 1-2 weeks since last charge). They died quickly in my Nikon SB-600 (flash) and, after relegating them to my wife's Canon S3, they died even faster. Luckily I paid a relatively low price for them at Sam's Club. I recently purchased a Lacrosse BC-900 so I'll see if that helps any (perhaps a dead battery or something).Interestingly enough, I never encountered this in my experiences with the 1700 and 2100 Energizer NiMH's. Go figure."
1,Very quick discharge rate poor performance after 40 charges,"These 2500ah batteries did work well for about 40 charges and now they last 50% less on the sames usage. I use these on my WII remotes and worked well for awhile. After about the 40th recharge they only last less than half the time anymore. They claim 1,000 recharges but it's a joke!! Do these thing build up a memory or something? I will try the Sanyo 2700ah AA batteries, I heard they are a bit better."
1,Not good for digital cameras,"I just bought these recently to use in my digital camera while on vacation. After fully charging them and inserting them in the camera they almost imediately showed a low battery icon on the camera. Several times I tried charging them, and then tried to use them with the same results. I was trying to avoid purchasing disposable batteries, since I take ALOT of pictures, but unfortunately that's what I ended up using."
2,Not holding a charge,"I figured something was wrong with these batteries after fully charge sets were dead within a couple of hours, and it turns out I was right. Do not buy these batteries. Stay away."
1,Energizer NiMH - DO NOT BUY - Just RUBBISH!,1000 recharges? What a joke. I have about 28 of these things and they have ALL DIED after 12 months domestic use. Thats $200 worth of batteries gone. I would have been better off with alkalines. On average the Energizers (NiMH 2500ma) would have been recharged about 10 times each progressively giving worse appliance life (digital camera)each time to the point where now all of the them refuse to charge at all. Unreliable and poor performance. Absolute crap. Thought I was buying a recognised brand and paying top dollar - I'm never buying ANYTHING by Energizer EVER again. ENELOOPs and Duracells work and last much better. Energizer I hate you and your rubbish. SHAME ON YOU.
1,Very few recharges,"I bought eight of these batteries, and after light usage for a year, all went in the trash. They just wouldn't hold a charge. A coworker just gave me four of the same that he said he never used and didn't need, so I charged them up. I tried using them a few days later, and all were dead. I have rechargeables from other companies that never fail, and I have a good LaCrosse charger, so I have to fault Energizer for making unreliable batteries."
2,Doesn't last as advertised,I have a Canon S2 and these batteries last almost as long as the cheap costco non-rechargable ones. They do take upto 8 hours to charge and Amazon is correct about that. Does anyone know of good long lasting 2500 Mah rechargable batteries??
4,With Patience these are very good batteries.,"They take eight hours to charge and the first few times you use them they do not last as long as you might like, but then they last as advertised, longer than non-rechargeable batteries. Not sure if the other brands that charge faster work as well as these or not."
3,"They die of old age, even without use.","When I bought these batteries, they were much cheaper than any other AA NIMH batteries on the market, to the tune of 50% or more. When I first used then, they lasted expected amount and recharges alright. After a few uses and a few months of sitting in the drawer, they seem to simply die on its own, without use. When I took them out and charged them again, they couldn't even keep a Pentax K200D running, right after a night of charging! I put each of them back on the charger, and the charger light won't turn on. Seems they just die of old age, even without any use. They're a year and half old. So beware, buy them if you expect active use in the near future, and be prepared to throw them away after a few months."
1,Not good.,"I've tried 8 of these and they do not work in my digital camera or wireless keyboard. In camera they last maybe 30 seconds before camera shuts off. In keyboard a little longer, but either misses keystrokes or hold down the keys.The Duracell AA NiMHs work great using the same energizer charger. 6 hours of video recording in camera, and 2-3 months between recharges in keyboard."
1,Wrong Capacity!!!!,The specs on this product said they were 2500 mAh batteries...however the batteries shipped were 2300 mAh. I wouldn't have bought them if the specs had ben given correctly.
4,You get what you pay for,"I thought that these were the 2500 NiMH which are $12.95 for 4. These were 8 for the same price. They are rechargeable NiMH, but are not quite as powerful as the 2500s. No complaints other than I should have known that you get what you pay for."
4,Long Lasting,These batteries seem to last longer than the others I have had so I haven't had to recharge them as often. I would highly recommend them to anyone who uses items requiring rechargeable batteries.
4,"high capcity, reliable, not too fat",2500mAH is why I bought it. Batteries hold charge for about 1-2 weeks. The newer batteries from Sanyo would be a bit better as they hold their charge longer.
1,Terrible Self-Discharge Rate,"I bought 20 of these on the recommendation of others. THey worked great for about 4 months, and then they stopped holding a charge. I can charge them up and leave them in my camera for a few days and it will tell me they are dead.Energizer NiMH are no good; go with Sanyos instead, you won't be disappointed."
2,Poor Longevity,Recharge 1000 times? We have recharged these batteries 50 times at most and then they start to fall of real fast. I was surprised because I really believed they were the best way to go.
1,Garbage,These batteries are absolute garbage. Both the AA and AAA discharge within a day or two. Tried two different Energizer branded chargers as well as a sanyo charger and still the same results. Won't take more than a handfull of photos on my point and shoot. They even run dry in my remote control after a week or so. This product is a complete waste of money.
1,Less than 1 year later...,"... and they come out of the charger dead.I bought these and a charger because they were advertised specifically for use in cameras. I expected them to wear out eventually, but certainly not this quickly! Would not recommend, especially for a camera."
3,These are 2450 mAh not 2500 mAh,"The description of this item says twice that these are 2500 mAh batteries. The picture shows this as well. However, upon ordering this item you will be informed by the seller that 2500 mAh batteries have been discontinued and that the picture is old. They should update the description and picture instead of telling you after your order is complete that they're sending you something other than what they advertised. These are actually 2450 mAh batteries. Also, this is not an 8-pack. It's actually two 4-packs."
1,Avoid these batteries,"I bought these batteries twelve months ago. I have just binned them because they cannot hold a charge for more than a week, with no use. I bought them to use in a digital camera. They have been regularly charged in an Energizer brand charger, so incorrect charging is not the problem.I was researching the issue to see if it was a problem with my new Canon camera but discovered a thread that shows there is a well-known issue with Energizer NiMh batteries. Fundamentally they are rubbish. OK for a few months then don't hold a charge. I have since bought Varta 'Ready-to-charge' NiMh batteries which are similar to Eneloops but cheaper and with a slightly higher capacity.My recommendation: do not buy Energizer NiMh batteries. There are plenty of other choices."
2,"Very poor shelf life, high internal discharge rate","I've had several sets of these over the past couple of years and I've found that they become virtually unusable after just a few uses. I have taken to carrying 3 extra sets of 4 of these in my digicam case and in several cases I've only gotten 10-20 photos out of the whole batch of 16 batteries, esp. if they've been in the case for a week or so. I thought I must be doing something wrong, or my charger was bad or something, but when I bought some other brands (Rayovac, Tenergy, and Powerex) I found they actually lasted about four times as long as either these Energizers or the equivalent Duracells that I had. I'll not be buying any more of these, or the Duracells either. They were cheap Walmart/Target sets but they're a waste of money."
1,Terrible self discharge rate,"I put these in my kid's toys. They were dead in a week without the toy being used. The Energizer Bunny would be dead before he was turned on. By contrast the Panasonic HHR-3UP equivalent lasts for months.If you are going to charge and use right away, they'll be fine (e.g. tape player). If you put them in something (camera, toy, flashlight) that you may want to use later, forget it.Amended Sept 2011:For Low Self Discharge NiMH batteries look for ""Pre-charged"" or ""ready to use"", such as the Sayno Eneloop (or Duracell ""Staycharged"", Rayovac ""Hybrid"".) EverReady/Energizer does not have a low self discharge NiMH as of late 2011."
1,Frustrating,Many times I cursed my camera to be eating batteries but then I tested the Energizer Batteries out of camera and found that they die automatically in as little time as one day. Never belive in Energizer.My camera now works with Sony batteries for months.
2,Less than satisfied,"I bought two sets of 2500 mAh NiMH Energizer batteries and have been less than satisfied with them. I am using an Energizer NiMH battery charger (the 6-7 hour timer type) and the batteries die after only a few shots in my Canon Powershot S2. One set dies after taking a picture or two -- this is immediately after charging them. I have since disposed of this set. Interestingly, their performance was very impressive at first, allowing two days worth of shooting hundreds of pictures and lots of video, but in the four months that followed, their longevity has greatly diminished. I have charged the batteries perhaps 30-50 times at most, and I believe these are rated for around 500 charges. I am currently looking elsewhere for a better NiMH battery solution."
3,Not as good as other cells,"I've had a couple sets of these batteries for about 3 years. I recently bought aLa Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha Power Battery Chargerto analyze and refresh these and other sets of batteries I own. What I found out was that I had a couple bad cells amongst these batteries. What I also found is that they tend to run completely dead if you let them sit. This is unlike some of the other rechargeable AA batteries I own. They have received fairly light use over the course of the three years that I've owned them.What is peculiar about the performance of these 2500mah cells is that I also have a couple sets of Energizer 2450mah cells and they are much better, despite being older. The 2450mah cells retain a greater charging capacity, and have lower self-discharge rates. I'm not sure what Energizer did with these particular cells, but they seem to be a weak choice relative to other options."
5,Energizer Rechargeable AA NiMH Batteries,"These batteries works great in my husbands hearing aid. He uses the kind of hearing aid with headphones because he cannot use the in the ear type. We have tried other batteries, but these are the best ones yet! We will keep buying these as long as he needs them."
2,OK but doesn't last (eneloop gets higher ratings),"These batteries are much better than buying regular alkaline batteries because they can be recharged many times over. I bought about 30 of the AA and AAA batteries and have used them for over two years for everything in the house: a wireless mouse and keyboard, TV remote controls, WII remotes, WII Fit balance board, Rock Band guitars and portable MP3 players.My main problem is the batteries self-discharge completely after 1-2 months. I am annoyed with having to replace batteries so often in my devices even when they sit unused. Because eneloop self-discharges much slower (or so I've read) and are about the same price, I'm recycling these Energizer batteries and getting eneloop."
4,Good but not so good,I would have to agree with some of the comments here about the discharge rate. I've had a set of 12 of these batteries since 2004 and they are still going strong. I don't know if the quality back then was better or not. I use these batteries for everything from digital camera flashes to my Wii controllers. I have had no problems with these batteries yet. I will probably buy more of them but will be more sensitive to the discharge rate to see if quality has gone down.
3,"Gets the job done, but...","I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews. For what HP charges for their inks, you would think they could put a little more in the cartridge. Come on, HP--we all know you can afford it!While the ink lasts, though, it does make a nice picture. I recommend performing a search of your printer model and then for ""refurbished"". You can get exactly what you're looking for and at half the price.Lina"
1,You'll be sorry if you purchase ink from this company.,"When I opened this HP 22 compatible ink cartridge package (labeled PTI - 22), ink was leaking inside the box. I cleaned up the ink and snapped the HP 22 compatible cartridge into my HP printer slot. The cartridge fit but my printer indicated that the cartridge was not compatible. This company sent me a cartridge that was close enough in size to fit into the HP 22 slot but it was the wrong cartridge. You'll be sorry if you purchase ink from this company."
2,5 ml of ink simply isn't enough,"I find that these HP 22 cartridges are waa-a-a-ay overpriced for the few drops of tri-color ink you get. I can't print more than about 10-15 pages - with the photos take up no more than about 33% of the page - before my computer starts giving me a low-ink warning. The color is great, but I can easily go through two cartridges a month. The next time I buy a color printer, I'm also going to factor in the ink capacity and cost of the cartridges."
2,Not for heavy use,"This cartridge produces beautiful photos, but don't expect to get much out of it if you plan on printing big projects. I am printing on A4 paper (7x11 inch photo) using premium photo paper in normal mode with approximately 80% coverage (there is some text on the photo). I only got 12 copies before the ""low ink"" alert came on. I just about had a fit. I have to print a total of 100 copies, so the cost just for ink is going to be over $170.00. Now I wish I had just ordered the prints instead of printing them myself. Bummer."
4,"Runs Out So Fast, But Not A Bad Price....","Compared with most other inks, HP inks do seem to run out more quickly than others (only topped by Lexmark who actually will shut down the cartridge with ink still in it). What can be said is this is genuine HP ink and you should have no issue with your printer recognizing it as such. The ink is very vivid and prints great. In comparison, this ink is usually even if by just a few cents cheaper on Amazon, but always shop around for the best price."
1,"great color, lousy size 5ml, will never buy HP again","No complaints about the quality of prints. However, this is going to be the last printer I ever get from them. HP 22 has only 5ml of ink! When I start printing 8x10s, I will get to about maybe 20 and I have to replace the cartridge. Yes, about 20! That's almost a $1 per photo page just on ink. I have an HP 5600. I will wait for it to become obsolete and then never again. If you want to print black and white, fine, if you want color, dont bother."
2,Runs low on Ink too fast!!way too fast!!!!!,Prints Clear beautiful letters but after printing 60 pages of documents the printer notified me that I was running low on ink.thats horrible!!it appears you will be spending a great deal of money on cartridges if you use your printer regularly!!not good!!!!my only option is to use my printer wisely so I wont use up unnecessary ink!!blah!!
1,Not printing,"It looks just like the orignal and cost a lost less but it is not recognized by my computer so therefore does not print,....pssssssst!"
4,Inked For HP,"It seems more and more like we need color inkjet printers, and the more and more we need them, the more we also need those cartridges too. The HP color inkjet cartridge #22 is a essential key for people who are into the HP deskjet 3900 series. The cartridges are very convient, and easy to setup into your inkjet printer. It not just prints well in color, it also prints nicely in black and white, for those who've run out of ink in their black and white inkjet cartridge. I like this a whole lot because it is convient and affordable.Price: BOverall: B"
1,HP 22 Tri-Color Ink Cartridge in Retail Packaging (C9352AN#140),"Lost in shipment, but Amazon supplied a speedy refund because the item was no longer available. I would definitely purchase this again when available. I have purchased this item in the past and I was always satisfied 100%."
3,HP 22 tricolor cartridge,"So far, so good. I've only just used this cartridge recently and it seems to be okay."
2,Out of date,Unfortunately the seller sent us an out of date cartridge. This was not mentioned in the sellers information. The date was obvious on the wrapper. I needed to use a color cartridge for some immediate printing so I had no choice but to install it. I only got a few good color sheets. After the initial first sheets the color the printing is now shaded and very light. I am disappointed.
2,Low Ink (5ml) Quantity - HP Cartridge,"This is a genuine HP ink cartridge...although it seems to run out rather quickly. I don't know if HP is filling cartridges with less ink; I hadn't noticed the quantity levels. Even with lower online price, it still seems to be high priced. I will now compare quantities carefully for future purchases.UPDATE (8/10/12): I guess this is really the only (original HP) choice I have for my printer. I love my printer...great copying, printing and scanning abilities. Thank goodness I haven't printed too many photos or color documents. So, I don't buy these cartridges too often but, I just bought another one here to save a little money at least."
3,would recommend for printing but not pictures,color a little dull when it comes to printing pictures get the orginual for that but for regular printing works great.
2,Running on Empty,"Although this cartridge prints well, it never seems worth the price for the paltry number of sheets printed you get, in my opinion. If its price were lower, I wouldn't feel so bad."
3,A fine product.,Definitely cheaper then going to Staples or one of those other stores. I feel ink cartridges are overpriced anyways. Hopefully this one will last.
2,Go through this ink in a wink,"It's ink...it works. What else can I say except that these cartridges are overpriced everyplace I've looked, and we go through them like water. I think by the time this school year is over we will have spent almost $800 on these stupid things!"
5,JUST AS EXPECTED,"I ordered the HP cartridges 21 and 22. Product was in tact and worked perfectly, AND received them quickly. They were in excellent condition, no damaged packaging...couldn't ask for better service...I will order my HP ink cartridges again from the exact same place....a positive experience."
1,It's the INK not the printer...,"It doesn't matter which printer you buy, HP, Canon, etc.. It's the cost of the ink where they get ya. Isn't it strange how your color inks run dry when you're printing black & white? It's a SCAM! For photos you are better off having your prints done by a lab than doing it yourself, because if you use third party inks over time the colors fade. For everything else, docs, kids homework, etc.. third party inks are the way to go. I remove my cartridges and put tape on the ends to seal them up if I'm not going to do any printing for awhile. Because either way in a couple of weeks when you go to print something the printer goes through a 5 min cleaning cycle, and at least the cartridges did'nt go dry in the meantime. If you think ink is a rip-off for these fax-scanner-printer models you ought to try using the Canon 9500 MKII photo printer with 10 ink cartridges! Most printers are inexpensive the ink is not."
1,me gusta,los recomiendo me gusto hacer negocios con ustedes el producto es muy bueno de verdad muy agradecidomuchas graciassaludos
5,These are great needles!,The needles came on time and are as they were described in the description. These are some great needles. Great price too.
1,Don't waste Your $$$$$,"Barely fit on the player, let alone came off easily. It was very cheaply made too."
3,educational but annoying,"Useful for high school or pre-college adult classes on personal finance, applied economics. Teaches basec money management, as part of a three part series. More humorous, interesting than the usual educational videos on the one hand, on the other hand, the humor is a little brash and irritating, may grate on your nerves a little."
3,Maria,Expected more...longer.....techniques....I don't feel I need 18 more words from my original sentence. That is just stupid and a waste of my time.
1,Another CD that will not play from Amazon,"This is the 3rd classical CD that I purchased from Amazon. The other 2 have been returned because they would not play. The CD player could not read the CD.I don't know where they come from, China?This one will be returned also, and I will not buy anymore from Amazon. It is not easy to buy CD's anymore since all the ""record stores"" have gone out of business due to MP3's and ipods, but I still like to listen to my CD player while I am in my office at home."
2,could be better,"this book is ""good looking"". it has many interesting pictures of the band and it has good cover. it's lovely. but this is not for the die hard fan. most of what mr clarke wrote is what we know already, almost nothing new. and a lot of mistake. a lot of misquoted sentences and stuff. spend your money on better book. but if you're still new to radiohead, this book can give you basic information about the band just fine."
1,Another boring biography (full of typos),"The problem I have with books about bands is that they focus almost solely on personality and the timeline, and not music. This book is no different. I could care less whether Thom Yorke is a depressed loner or the happiest guy in the world. I'd love to learn the real details of production and recording techinques, other than just lists of instruments used to record albums.Unfortunately, a band like Radiohead isn't too excited about letting anyone view their recording sessions, so we're stuck with another book about Thom Yorke's paranoia, fear of the modern world, etc.Oh, and the typos are rife. I seriously doubt anyone edited this book. There are so many double ""the""s, ""of""s in the place of ""or""s, and flat out mistakes (an Ondes Martenot was not used for Star Wars, the band's name is Sigur Ros, not Signor Ros, etc) it's hard to take. Skip this book, look up all the band bio info on the internet, and save your 80 cents or whatever."
2,Wrong Impression,This is for Urdu speakers onlyIt does not work for people trying to learn UrduBut it is for Urdu speakers trying to learn englishEnglish speakers beware!
4,The Little Oxford English-Urdu Dictionary,"This dictionary is perfect for classroom use. It provides the most commonly used words, phrases, and their translations. I recommend this product to all teachers who have Urdu-speaking students in the classroom."
1,yet another apologist for Japan,"This is one of the most superficial and ridiculous books on Japan that I came across. Though a Harvard scholar, Reischauer has such a flimsy grasp of modern Japan that it is simply and utterly appalling. It is like he wants the Japanese to love him and so writes only about the nicest things that he can find, while ignoring anything untoward - or even baselessly asserting that all problems like the Yakuza (!) will simply disappear as the country ""matures"". Well, if you've lived there and seen that there is much ugliness beneath the veneer of democracy and politness, this book will disgust you to no end.Not recommended. It is a pathetic performance and deeply disappointing."
5,Ann-Margret's underrated RCA years...,"This 2-disc, CD set contains all the best Ann-Margret recordings from her RCA studio years, and is a lot more accessible than the uber-expensive box set, now out of print, from Bear Family Records. All these sessions are mostly from the 60's, and it shows that she really had a knack with a song. Amazingly, she never made much of an impact on the pop-record scene, where she certainly showed more talent than she did in the movies. Her retro-sex kitten image was never hotter than on a lot of these recordings, among the best cuts are: TEACH ME TONIGHT, MR. KISS KISS BANG BANG, MACK THE KNIFE, BEGIN THE BEGUINE, and, worth the price of admission on it's own: THE SWINGER!"
3,Almost the opposite of Clowes' strengths,"Clowes' strengths are his sublime pacing, wonderful atmosphere, and realistic characters - none of which he displays in his short stories. He is just, as Spiegelman says, a ""wiseass."" Some people like the early Eightballs because they're more comic than his later works, but Clowes cannot compete with the classic humor comics like Howard the Duck and Cerebus: High Society. His longer works, on the other hand, are top rate stuff.These stories aren't bad, but they're not good either. Certainly not worth buying."
3,deliverd by expected date,It was in good condition... It just took three weeks longer to get than other books I ordered at the same time.
1,Pretentious curmudgeonry best left under wraps,"Clowes admits in his introduction that Art Spiegelman called Clowes' early work his ""total wiseass period."" He should've taken the hint.As a fan of Daniel Clowes' ""David Boring"" and ""Ghost World,"" as well as his screenplay based on the latter, I was disappointed to discover how much of a jerk he'd been early on. The rants remind me of my adolescence, but as Clowes was college-age and up when he first published these comics, immaturity is not an excuse. While this book will interest hardcore Clowes fans, I do not recommend it to the casual Clowes enjoyer."
1,Christmas morning disapointment,"This toy was only kinda fun. It went at a very sedate speed, but my granddaughter seemed to enjoy it. However after about 15 minutes it would no longer hold a charge. I am returning it."
1,Reviews were right..JUNK!,"I was hoping that the previous reviews were not the case but I was wrong. I bought 2 of these for easter presents, thank god I had other ""back up"" toys. The car would not align on the charger, when it did charge, it only worked for about 10 seconds. There was no wallet or keychain in the package either. [...]."
2,Won't Charge,We had a lot of trouble getting this car to charge. The charger nodes wouldn't line up so we could charge it. We will be returning this toy.
3,wish it would have worked out.,My friend & I loved this tent except one pole gave out the 3rd time we set it up and the material on the door side was sewn too tight so we couldn't use the tent clips on the poles. The zipper would have failed. Wish it would have worked out because we loved the ventilation and overall design of the tent. Maybe we just got a bad one.
1,Pole broke first time,"First of all, the package turned up battered and ripped, which I wasn't happy about. Given that, I thought I'd better test the tent by putting it up in my back yard. It was a good thing that I did because one of the elastic chords that holds the pole together snapped immediately. I can probably fix it using one of my old tent poles, but that's pretty bad for a brand new $200 tent. I've been camping for years and never had one of these things break before. Obviously, I am not a happy camper.Update: well, 3 years later, nothing has broken and the tent has been fine. It's a good size for 2 people, and easy to set up (even though my son mysteriously disappears during setup and teardown). I like the way the rain cover uses 2 poles rather than the usual 1, much easier to set up on your own. Apart from the initial letdown, I'm pretty happy with this tent."
2,Sorry to say,"Anyone buying this tent has not had good tents. This tent is made cheaply. I haven't a clue how to hang the do dads that come with it for the inside. The instructions only make mention of them, but do not say how or where to put them. In addition the center has no D ring to hang items. Seems to me anyone who makes tents ought to know that. I cannot say if it leaks, but I used it in a misty morning and it nearly leaked with that situation. The front door only has 1 zipper that goes 1 way, so you had better be on the correct side if ya want to open it during the night when there is no light. It is also so short you need to crawl into it despite the center hight being adequate I will be looking for another tent."
5,Weekend warrior friendly,I purchased this tent based on high marks from Consumer Reports. First time set up took about 20 minutes (15 min going forward). Well made and stores easily. Plenty of room for 3 people (4 might be a little cramped).
4,Great overall tent,"Just purchased this tent and used it the other weekend for the first time. So easy, I put it up by myself, didnt even have to look at the directions! Great tent for any season! Big enough for myself and two Labradors with room to spare."
3,Eureka Sunrise 9,I like the size and style of the tent.The problem is that there was a hole at the top of the rain fly about the size of a pencil.That should not have been missed at the factory.I was ready to go camping and did not want the hassle of getting the tent replaced.I patched the hole. I would have given it 5 stars if it werent for the hole. Gone Campin
4,Finally a square tent,"My brother bought this tent. I tested it and bought one for myself. It proved to be waterproof in a pretty heavy rain. But the best part - it is square. No struggling to keep the carts or air mattresses away from the sides. It is almost impossible with those weird shaped tents. Also this tent is plenty high enough for my six foot brother to stand up. I also purchased the Sunrise 11. Can't wait for my family to use both tents next season. Of course, unless you are sleeping on a small mat, a 4 person tents fits 2 (maybe 3) people comfortably."
1,MINERAL OIL IS 2ND INGREDIENT IN PRODUCT,MINERAL OIL is the SECOND ingredient on the list. This information is not disclosed in the store front product description before you make the purchase.......Very misleading if you think you're getting All Natural Ingredients. NOT SO! and I'm DISAPPOINTED
5,GREAT FOR CURLY/COURSE HAIR! <3,"I really enjoy this product! Its not greasy or smelly like everyone else said! I've been using it for about a week now and I see some growth, surprisingly! A little goes a long way. The bottle is good for the price and it was shipped within the given time. After using it for about three days, my hair was so bouncy, shiny and held up my hairstyle longer than any other product I have used ! I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who wants their hair to be longer and stronger!******UPDATE*******Hello, I'm back! :)I just recently washed my hair and flat ironed it and it looks soo much longer. I have only used it about 15 times in the pass 3 weeks and my hair is now pass my shoulders and my hair use to be between my shoulder and ear ! This product is amazing!!"
5,Does what it say's it's going to do !,"The oil works great it's not heavy and a little goes along way . And it does promote fast hair growth. My hair always grows 1/2 inch every month like its supposed to , but with this it's doubled ! I would recommend for someone who is looking for a oil to keep their scalp healthy while reaping the benefits of growth."
3,Stinky....,"Stinky, stinky stinky but I still mix it with my henna. I use shikakai shampoo now so I've really laid off the oil except for henna mixes. I love the results I'm getting...my hair is so much stronger and full."
2,"It has liquid parrafin aka"" Mineral Oil"" a natural's NO-NO !","I was a little disappointed because the 2nd ingredient listed is mineral oil. It has a smell, but they recommend you apply it @ night, the odor disipates by the morning. I a few drops in hot oil treatments, just to use because I paid for it. The rest of the oils listed are beneficial, but the mineral oil makes me a little weary."
1,Don't like it,"It does not work for me. It breaks my hair, and the smell is really bad in my opinion.I don't like this product at all."
4,Nice hair oil,"This oil was every thing it said it would be. And yes, it does have an odd smell to it.I added it to coconut oil. It's a nice light oil."
1,Fake Fragrance,"This bottle of ""something"" smells vaguely like Quelques Violletes, but you'd better smell fast because the fragrance loses it's potency so quickly. Smart move Amazon not to allow returns because you'd get every bottle back. I am sooo disappointed because I love this perfume so much."
1,DO NOT EVER BUY FROM THEM!!,This bottle was bought for a Christmas gift and when the person receiving opened the gift the perfume had a very old musty smell to it. (should be noted this perfume is her favorite and she has worn it for years...very aware of the smell). When it was brought to my attention and asked to return they would not take it back!! They have been very difficult to work with. Lesson learned NEVER BUY PERFUME ON THE INTERNET.....especially from this vendor....
2,Quelques Fleurs,"I received this in a very timely manner- before I expected. However, I used to wear this years ago and know it very well. Based on my prior excellent history with Amazon and the reviews, I ordered Quelques Fleurs. I was disappointed that it smelled like a knock off. I could tell as soon as I opened it and it seemed watered down. The label did not seem authentic. You really do get what you pay for."
5,Good quality fragrances,"NY Nights smells very good and very similar to Drakkar Noir. A sophisticated nose may be able to sniff out the subtle differences if a wrist-to-wrist comparison is done but for all practical purposes it is just like Drakkar. And it lasts !!! I sprayed some on my skin and one spray on my shirt, it lasted all day on my skin and after 3 days I can still smell it on my shirt. And this is not a cologne, just a body spray !!!! I got a 5-in-one gift set for a steal that had the imposters versions of drakkarnoir, curve, chanel blue, a&f; fierce and aqua di gio. The drakkar and blue de chanel ones are really good, curve and fierce copies are very similar and good too and last a long time. I've never really liked aqua di gio (the real one) so i don't much care for that one but it still is a good reproduction but doesn't last as long as the others.Highly recommended if you want designer fragrances for cheap."
5,A big hit in the baby's bath,My grand daughter loves these. I bought both packages so we'd have all the sea creatures. Our girl loves to sit in the tub and play with all of them. She grabs them and chews on them. They keep her entertained for a long time.
3,ok,"picture showed five pieces and there was only four and package could have been a little better, but shipment was on time."
3,cute,These are very cute. My only problem with them is that they are more difficult to drain all the water from than others we have had. They will probably have a short lifespan in our house.
4,Good tub toys!,My daughter has fun with these in the tub. Pretty simple squirties. They are good size and dont take up much room in the toy bucket.
4,Cute,My daughter loves these toys and looks forward to playing with them in the tub every day. My only concern is the paint on the toys which is starting to come off because my daughter chews on everything. Overall very cute toys.
5,Detailed technique for the Photoshop user,"If you have ever wanted to try your hand at creating panoramic photographs but just didn't know where to start or have had a hard time getting it right then this book is for you. It details the process from how to compose and shoot the pictures, digitize them, assemble, and retouching them to create your final composition. Some of the examples include unique point of view projects like ""Urban Sphere"" where the 360 degree panorama appears as the surface of a sphere. You should be warned that all the techniques illustrated are done using Adobe Photoshop software. So, if you are planning to follow along then you will need a copy of Photoshop. Written by nine leading French artists, Assembling Panoramic Photos is excellently done, lavishly illustrated and details the various techniques used to achieve masterful results."
3,A decent book on digital pano photography,"This is a decent book on digital panoramic photography. It seems to be geared to the Photoshop skilled person. While it's somewhat easy to follow, I found that if you're not familiar with Photoshop you'll have a hard time with this. Thankfully I have used Photoshop quite a bit, so I was ok. It doesn't go as in depth on each image as I'd prefer, but it's good. I find that it gives you enough information to be dangerous. Lots of good ideas on how to process and stitch together your panoramic images. The only downside is that it only really recommends on specific type of panoramic stitching software (Instead of manually doing it in Photoshop) and the one recommended isn't that great. The software they recommend is grossly overpriced and not as easy to use as PTGui in my opinion.If you are fairly familiar with Photoshop, I totally recommend this book. It'll give you ideas to have fun and play with."
2,Short on details,"A picture may well be worth a thousand words, but 8 pictures doesn't add up to a a book. This book takes the reader through 8 photographs by 8 different photographers who outline the techniques they used to generate them. Although some of the pictures are impressive, this book is a bit short on detail. If you are looking to get started with Panoramic pictures, you'd best start with some other books."
4,delicate work in Photoshop,"The latest in O'Reilly's series by French artists. As with the earlier books, this tries to speak to you at a level above mere craftsmanship. While the latter is desirable and indeed necessary before you grip this book, more intangible issues are discussed here.Unsurprisingly, Photoshop is the most common package used by the artists. Other offerings are peripherally invoked, like Real Viz's Stitcher or PanaVue's Image Assembler. It's just that overall, nothing matches the comprehensive set of tools in Photoshop.Making a panorama can be tricky. Aligning those photos well is not trivial, in order to have a seamless transition. So the methods here are quite handy to master. The book can make you wonder, though. What on earth did people do for panoramas, before Photoshop and computers?"
2,Better off reading off the Internet,"If you're looking to start taking QTVR or the likes kind of photo, you're better off reading off the Internet and/or visiting forums to ask about taking the shot, finding the nodal point, stitching them together, publishing them on the web. This book takes 8 guys who takes 8 different pano then put them into a book. That's about it. You won't learn anything new in terms of technique/s. Like for the one on Almanarre Beach, instead of advising readers how to minimise doing the photoshopping away of waves and people which the book covers a lot, they should have advise users to take as little shots as possible. I guess this book is trying to cover on Photoshop techniques pertaining to pano photographers."
5,Excellent Blender,"I've had this about 2 months now and love it. It is easy to use, very productive, looks sharp, and easy to clean! Definately recommend this to anyone with a nice kitchen. This is a really professional grade processor so make sure you have counterspace in your kitchen!"
5,Love this food processor!,"We recently purchased this KitchenAid food processor and love it! We have two kids under 3 in our house and needed a powerful machine that was QUIET. This one is that and so much more. I can puree baby food while the baby sleeps in the next room with the door open. And purees are so easy with such a powerful machine. Larger cooking & baking jobs are a breeze as well. The 3 bowl sizes offer flexibility and clean up for the entire processor is easy. It took us a while to figure out what had to be locked and in what order to get the machine to work, so do read the instructions. It is a large and heavy unit so it does take quite a bit of counter space, but it looks great and we use it so frequently I don't mind having it out and handy."
1,Convoluted Cheap Switch Eliminates Long-term use,"The ""On"" switch operates in the following manner. Working backwards, there is simply a recessed push button on the base which switches the motor on when depressed. There is a convoluted series of springs and cheap plastic arms that run through the plastic bowl, the handle, the lid and must be activated by the feed tube. There are at least 3 flimsy safeties. Safe to be sure, but one little cheap plastic piece breaks, and you must purchase the entire upper assembly to have the appliance operational again. A third of the cost of the unit because a 20-cent plastic piece breaks. Ridiculous.It only holds 4-cups of liquid or it leaks all over the counter. This was one of consumer reports really good buys. So much for their research. $250 for about a year's worth of light-duty food processing.THREE THUMBS DOWN Kitchenaid. Great motor, bad product."
4,wife loves it,I bought this for my wife on our anaversery and so far she likes it. She hasn't used all of the features yet but she liked what she has used so far. It is easy to clean up and looks good in our kitchen
1,Warning,"I got this for Christmas and was extremely thrilled until last night when the disk stem got stuck in the machine and it cannot be removed. I called for warranty service and was told that these products are custom made and I must therefore wait 4-6 weeks to receive my replacement product. Yeah, I'm not too thrilled about having a broken product that is utterly usless to me and cost over $250 and it will now be sitting on my countertop (or my garage collecting dust) for 4-6 weeks.They won't even send me an interim product in another color for me to have a food processor to use until they can manufacture my new machine. And taking it in to a service repair shop isn't an option because the machine still gets sent to Kitchenaid for repair and it's still 4-6 weeks to wait on the replacement product.If I had known this, I probably would not have bought this machine."
5,Poverty and Privelege,"I just finished reading this book. I have read several others in this series and highly recommend them. I think this and the other Poldark books are some of the best historical novels I have read in years.!! Winston Graham writes so well of life in 1780's Cornwall.Ross Poldark, our hero, has just returend to his family home after 2 years fighting in the Revolutionary war, and is hoping for a reunion with the woman he loves. The author describes every detail of life as if he had lived in those times. One becomes very involved with the characters.One constant theme in this book is the contrast between the desperately poor common people and the gentry. Ross Poldark is a gentleman who is unusual for his concern with the wellbeing of the ""lower classes.""You probably won't want to stop with just this book. I'm very glad to hear that these are finally being reprinted in the U.S."
5,wow,"wow! this game is so fun it is not as good as the first one though, but it is still fun...you have to get it!"
4,"Quick read, multiple short stories",It is a great gathering of professionals from the field of leadership. The format of different authors for each chapter on different topics keeps it flowing and fresh.
1,BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE,"This unit PROBABLY doesn't do what you think it does. If you read the website and the box, it looks like you can shoot wonderful HD movies, push a button and voila! a DVD pops out and you can SHARE it with friends and family. Notice it is called the ""Share Station""! NOT - the unit spits out a DVD that ""cannot be played on normal DVD players"" (page 47 of the manual). This unit is simply an ARCHIVAL unit. It takes whats in your camera and backs it up to a DVD. Thats it. Call JVC and verify it."
1,Camera ok..............share station......very very poor,"The sharestation is probably the worst piece of equipment I have ever purchased. Worked when it wanted to the first couple of months, now it doesn't work at all. I have always liked JVC products but after this dreadful experience, I am gonna have to think long and hard before I buy ANYTHING from JVC. This item will not recognize ANY disc, even the ones I made with it"
1,Common Problems Abound,"Well, I read many poor reviews on the internet about the product, and the reviewer is correct, this is an archival unit only, and won't generate a DVD that can be played on anything other than the JVC ShareStation. Unfortunately, I had already purchased a $1600 JVC camcorder which I could not return due to it having 5 hours of footage of my new baby (which I can't get off of it) on its HDD. So, I went ahead and purchased with these limitations in mind.Unfortunately, when the unit arrived, it was defective. Won't recogonize any disc of any type. Even the disc supplied by JVC in the packaging showed up as ""incompatible disc.""If you have already purchased the camcorder, you may also be stuck purchasing this unit; however, if you have not yet purchased a camcorder, I would strongly consider another brand.See ya!"
1,"WORTHLESS JUNK, WASTE OF MONEY",PURE OVERSEAS PRODUCED GARBAGE!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND SAVE YOURSELF A GREAT DEAL OF AGGRAVATION. JVC CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE AND UNCARING. WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANOTHER JVC PRODUCT.
1,Did not work w/my camera,Could not play or record DVDs with this unit. Returned for a prompt and full refund. No complaints
5,Works Great,This product works great. No problems with disk error messages.Great for backing up your data until you can process.
3,Nice effort,"Ellis definitely has a charismatic personality, but unfortunately she should stick to studio albums. Her constant forgetfulness and flightiness gets old, but her songs are still soothing."
3,You get what you pay for,"The features were nice for the money although I really wished it had a radio. Still, I bought it with moderate expectations hoping to use it during my workout to listen to some audio books that don't require high quality audio sound. Well, it arrived in defective condition - it wouldn't connect to my Win XP PC via USB port. Having taken a close look at the way it is made I decided to get a refund rather than a replacement. Wasted time.To Amazon's credit I must say that they make returns as easy as possible under the circumstances."
5,Love it!,"What an absolutely inspiring book! I found the love of my life two years ago at the age of 46! We are so happy and have such a fulfilling life. I wish we had a book like this 20 years ago so we wouldn't have wasted so much time and tears! Love is the greatest relationship you will experience! Beautiful book, beautifully written! A must read for anyone who is wishing for love in their life!"
2,A poor buy,"This book is worthless because :- it offers little insight into Avery's genius- it's short on the man's biography- it focuses too much on the cartoons- a large portion of it is made up of interviews with Avery and others; it's easy to write books that way, using text that's already written- every picture is in black and white; not a single one in colour; would you like to watch Avery's cartoons in b & w ?- it is printed on mediocre paper; when you're reading a page you are very much aware of the pictures printed on the other side of the page- it's grossly overpriced"
3,"not a ""paperback""","this is sheet music for the song. I thought it was a paperback version like the hardcover listed elsewhere. If you want sheet music it's fine, but it was not what I was looking for"
1,Do not buy if you're hoping for a good piano piece,Buy this if you have a flute (or some other instrument) to play the lead. Do not buy it if you're hoping for a nice piano arrangeent. It adds nothing to the standard sheet music that you can find in any Episcopal hymnal.
3,Good item Bad company,I have bought this stone and 4 other.This one is good. But D4FF is not flat (read my review).One out of five is not very good rate.BUT the DMT does not have customer service!!!Two month of emails and filling forms - no reaction.
2,Only My Opinion,"I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AND IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE USED AND SINCE I'D READ ABOUT THAT FROM OTHERS USERS OF THE BEN WA BALLS, I DECIDED TO CLEAN THEM AND GIVE THEM A TRY. WELL I HAD THEM A GOOD WEEK. THEY CHIPPED AND TARNISHED SO I THREW THEM AWAY. I GAVE THE PRODUCT A 2 BECAUSE I THINK UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE WORKED. IN FACT IF I THOUGHT I COULD GET THEM TO SEND ME A REPLACEMENT PAIR, I WOULD GO FOR IT!"
2,Not Impressed,"This book contains around 900 different words. It is organized as flashcards in a bookform, with 3 words on every page. If you are disorganized and always lose your flashcards, I guess that this is the book for you. However, I was disappointed at having a lot of semi-flashcards that where too soft to be cut out, and that I could not organize as I wanted. Moreover, I found that many of the words were too easy (almost one third) even though I am not a native speaker. So native speakers must find this level ridiculously easy. The book claims to be ""interactive"". With that word it refers to a line beneath each word where you can feel free to write your own definition. Then again I just guess that my definition of interactive is disparate to the others definition."
4,Useful for studying. Works best when used alongwith a Phone/PDA software,"The flash cards help a lot since they are quite effective in learning. However, they are somewhat of a pain to carry. Consider using along-with GRE Tough Words application (available at Handango) which works on almost all cellphones and does the same in a much more convenient form factor and can be used whenever you have a few spare minutes."
3,HP's got great printers but...,Waaaayy too few prints out of these cartridges. They seem to last about half as long as standard cartidges for my previous Epson and Canon printers. Quality is good. Number of sheets per cartidge is poor.
5,HP 92 & 93 Ink Cartridges for 1510xi - Picture Quality printing/scanning/copying,"I have a PSC 1510xi All-In-One printer and I also have the 6000 series all in one that takes a 56 and 57?(I think) Anyways, the 92 & 93 HP ""real"" not aftermarket or refurbished ink cartridges produce very High-Quality Photographs and I think are better than my newer, 3 times as expensive HP AL-In-One Printer/Copier/Scanner.This is a great product, for a reasonable price and if you only use the normal or best print setting for pictures and use FastEconomical the rest of the time; all documents turn out looking great and the ink lasts about a year. I love HP Printers!"
5,"Language, poetry & philosophy","A finely crafted translation of a pivotal book in contemporary European thought, phenomenology, post-modernism, and literary theory. The book is a must read for those interested in the relation between poetry and philosophy, not only in Heidegger, but also as this conflictual pair of terms moves through recent 20th century European theory and literature. Although one may criticize Heidegger's investment in Holderlin's writing and life as partial, and perhaps as conceptually manipulative, the book offers a fascinating engagement with the life of words."
1,"Bad German, Adds Little to Philosophy...","This ""scholar"" should stick to the environment he knows best: The American Community College. He has no place in the academic milieu to which he asprires: His German translations are horrendous (perhaps a bit harsh, but...they are bad)and his comments add little to the philosophical knowledge base. Perhaps he should turn to biography - who knows? But not philosophy!Move on...the community colleges need good teachers, why not be one of them?Dare Poenas."
4,Great Versions...But Where is Jorgen Ingmann?,"Apache is a song that my father played for me when I was young. It's become one of my all-time favorites, since. Jorgen Ingmann's version is the one that I know best, but strangely, it's not included here, making this just less than complete.Otherwise, it's a great collection of versions of this song. If you really love this tune, and don't mind a little repetition, this is a good purchase."
2,Too Expensive!,"I have been thinking of buying these Northern bench ends for several years, but they are overpriced compared to the other 2 by 4 bench ends for sale on Amazon. They are just formed plastic. No reason they should cost $100, IMO. So I am going to buy the cheaper ones. Wake up Northern!"
5,THIS IS A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR ALL OF US,THIS IS A BOOK WE ALL CAN RELATE TO AND WE ALL CAN LEARN FROM
1,Hype,"If you are looking for real answers, don't buy this book. It's a feel good read but provides nothing more than a bunch of hot wind. Morever, the style is bland, sleepy, like a ghostwriter did the best he could from notes he took from dictation."
5,"Joel Rothschild says, I am a long term Aids survivor",Forgiveness is one of the keys to surviving loss and pain. It is something we do for ourselves. To release hurt is to our own advantage. To hold it will kill us. This is a wonderful book and an important tool for living.
1,A Religious book for Christians but not helpful for others,"I bought and read this book and found it to be a superficial treatment of the subject for Christians who believe in a single God, which I am not. I finished the book hoping for a deeper understanding of guilt and forgiveness after experiencing the recent suicide of my only child, a seventeen year old boy suffering from severe depression. I am sure this book will be comforting for those it is written for but it did not shed any light on the subject for me."
3,Good for reference but not passing the test (640-861),"Although it contains useful information but does not come close to covering the exam objectives. The new CCDA exam (640-861) tests extensively on design and other topics such as VoIP and IPv6. I read the book cover to cover, went through all the questions at the end, covered the scenarios, but all that prep just wans't enough to cut the mustard.Having said that, I would say at least an order of magnitude better than Lammle-Brkl book by Sybex press. That was a complete waste of some unfortunate tree.Going with Self Study guide and Top Down design by Cisco press. Use the Exam Cert Guide as a reference but don't rely on it to pass the CCDA test."
3,Not Quite Right,"While this book covers much that is on the exam, it's focus never felt quite right as a study guide for this test. Having just passed the CCDA DESGN exam 640-861, I recommend the Diane Teare book if you need in-depth explanation and total test coverage. For exam focus and final test preparation I recommend the Sequeira, Wallace book."
1,Want to pass the CCDA exam? Buy another book.,"I'm a big fan of Cisco Press material, which I bought to prepare the CCNA exam. I used this book for the CCDA exam and did not come even close to the passing score.There's so much problems with that book, I don't know where to start. Its biggest issue is that it misses several key exam topics. Usually Cisco Press offers up-to-date complementary material to download from their web site. That's not the case here.There are more issues. It's poorly written, so you get frustrated reading it and trying to figure out what the author really meant. Many sections are repetitive and some facts are simply incorrect.I'll buy the other Cisco Press book - Diane Teare's DESGN - to get ready to repeat the exam. I believe that Cisco Press should simply no longer offer this book, stick to a single title for the CCDA and most importantly, keep it up to date."
3,"Necessary, but not sufficient.","Authors Bruno & Kim have produced a book which is essential for anyone studying for the CCDA exam. However, it is not sufficient to pass the exam alone. In fact, it doesn't even cover all the topics on the sample quizzes provided on the book's CD. It also misses CCDA information provided by some other authors. Serious students should also consider Designing Cisco Networks by Teare (which is mostly another look at the same stuff), Cisco's Internetworking Technologies Handbook, and Lammle's CCDA Study Guide. Yes, you need Bruno & Kim, but you need more, too."
2,No good,"I took the my CCDA test today and failed the first time after passing my CCNA & CCNP all in one attempt.I have always used Cisco press books for all my exams but this one does not appear to be good book,after the test I have almost felt like that I have used a wrong book.Thanks"
3,It is OK but not good enough,I passed the exame in Feb. 2001. The coverage of this book is definitely not in par with the test. I have some networking background so it helps. To read the book is necessary but other materials are strongly encourged.
2,They Could Have Been More Organized...,"This book contains a lot of information obviously written by a group of people who didn't talk to each other. Most of the information is repeated several times. Content is very disorganized. Most other Cisco Press Certification Books are much better organized. On a positive note, the CD Rom is VERY helpful. (Note that as of this date (Mar 2003) the test 640-441 has been retired and replaced by 640-861.)"
2,Surely not an exam certification guide,"This book is not built well and is not good for CCDA exam.Chapters taking most of this book are almost not required in real exam while chapters that are 7-10 pages have to be studied much more in depth.If you want to have a basic knowledge , read this book , if you want to pass an exam read the self-learning series for this exam."
5,Brush Up and Pass CCDA,"As in my review for DCN, You'll need exactly two books in order to pass the ( sometime ppl said the hardness equal to CIT ) CCDA. This book will complement your DCN Course or self-study with practical ( study cases ).Good luck ! Scored 802 in just 60 mins"
1,Full of wrong information,This book contains too much wrong information and editorial errors in the first several chapters that I read. Hope the authors can read the book themselves and fix those in the next edition.
4,Good tutorial but not exam preparation material,"I passed exam using only this book but ...This book is pretty well written design tutorial but it's not very good for exam preparation. I was really amazed how different is real exam from examples in the book. Real test had many questions on case studies instead of general questions like in examples on CD. I also had a few questions on ATM which were not covered at all.Of course, this book is not bad and it's possible to pass exam, especially if you plan to use several tutorials. But if you want to buy only one book you prabably should consider some other choices."
3,Fair Bargain,"This compilation is a fair bargain, especially for somebody perhaps looking for some period-instrument performances to supplement more traditional versions. However, if you are looking for a library version, these recordings don't really stand up to the competition of Gardiner, Jacobs, or most especially Oestman. Oestman's recordings of the Da Ponte trilogy, as well as ""Der Zauberfloete"" are available in a Decca ""Collector's Edition"" box and are a lot more generally competitive than these."
5,Rollins Tells It Like It Is!!,"Don't be fooled by the limited number of tracks on this disc. Rollins rants on for 76 minutes about Love, Hate, Depression, and the lovely young Fran who got away. My favorite is I wish Someone Would have Told Me. We get to see the early Rollins growing up feeling so different from all of his peers, and finding out the mystery about woman. Love him, hate him, He will always be Rollins, and I think that this is one of his best discs. Misunderstanding starts off way dark, but finishes up with a great rant about a punker fan who has an odd way of expressing his love for his favorite singer!! Enjoy it LOUD!!!"
4,"More ""Dynamite Hack"" from Hank","This record contains some of the most intense stories I have heard Rollins tell. Stories about the difficulty of dealing with sex when you're young, the vaccuum that forms for some people who find themselves with no one they can talk to on a personal level.There is some humor on this record, most notably ""Misunderstanding"", which describes one of Rollins' many culture-clash experiences. ""Travel Tips"" is another tough one; although told with humor, it makes you feel bad for the young Henry, a kid with boundless energy and no one in his family willing to help him work it out or deal with him like he was a human being.Henry came out of it OK, and we his listeners are the winners; every record he releases shares a little bit more of experience and life with us. Keep it up."
4,"a look at ""Florida Wildfloers""","The Guide to Florida Wildflowers by Taylor has been most helpful to me, a photographer, in identification for cataloging of my images. The book is well organized and probably one of the most complete on the subject of Southeastern wildflowers that I own or have been able to borrow. The only drawback, which presents itself as a major problem at times, is that many of the images in the book are ill-defined. The flowers in some of the images are either out of focus (ex: Buttonweed, pg. 105) or so small in relation to the picture (ex: White Lobelia, pg. 107) that even a magnifying glass is of no use. Overall though, I give the book a very good rating. I have read a great many books on the subject of wildflowers and have yet to find anything to replace it. MAB"
5,Know Your Florida Wildflowers,"I can't get over the amazing range of wildflowers growing in Central Florida. Finding this book was a thrill, as now I can identify them all. There's forsythia salvia, pinkish horsemint, beach sunflower, pine lily, and so many more. Unfortunately not all of the photos are clear enough to aid in identification.For each flower, he provides the scientific and common names, a brief description, flowering time, habitats, geographical range, color photo, and miscellaneous comments. The descriptions of the leaves and growth is very scientific and doesn't mean much to someone who doesn't know the difference between a bract or a pedicel. I should devote some time to reading and understanding the front section of the book (Structural Characteristics of Wildflowers)."
1,Frustrated,"I live on the Treasure Coast of Florida (between Sebastian and Hobe Sound) and up till now I relied on various websites to help me ID plants. Because this method of searching is very time consuming I thought it was time to invest in a field guide.Armed with 20+ plants already identified I used these as my starting point. My search through the index of this book concluded with 8 listings out of 20+ plants. Such low results are a tremendous disappointment!While time consuming, I will return to the internet for more current and accurate plant identifications."
4,A Florida Backpack Necessity,When I am out stalking the wild vegitation of North Florida and South Georgia this is one of several books I put in my backpack. I agree with another reviewer that sometimes the flowers get lost in the photos but most of the time the plant structure and habitus provide useful information. What makes this book a great carry-along is that the plants are color-coded by their flowers. I recommend it highly.Matt Cohen
5,etc,"sort of amazing debut from these guys...great guitar from the opening of the title cut to end...one of those albums that youre amazed how great it is from start to finish,includiing the extra 4 song ep that makes up the last 4 songs.also, they dont get more nicer than larry who's always been approachable as hes watched opening bands warming up with some brewage."
1,Doesn't work for me,"I don't hate it, but it simply doesn't unstop my nose. Maybe it will work for you. I won't buy it again. JudyB"
1,didn't help,"it was highly recommended by people whose judgment I trust but no surprises here: if you believe in homeopathy it would work, if you don't it wouldn't."
4,Perhaps not for everyone?,"There is a slight mood stabilizing effect these pills give me, but it's generally not substantial. On the other hand, I've found these help me stay asleep all night much more effectively than kava or similar herbal substances.One warning: Some of my friends tried these out but had no effect even at unusually high doses that worked for me. I'm certain it wasn't a placebo effect as I've taken supplements that don't work, so I'm not sure why this discrepancy exists- I guess i'll chalk it up to individual neurochemical differences."
2,I don't know,"I never felt anything different in my mood. 5-htp actually caused me to have insomnia, which I never experienced before in my life."
2,Mislabeled,"The only problem is that the bottle is mislabeled. It is 100 mg, not 50 mg, which is an overdose for me."
2,5-HTP I like. Direct Super Center I don't,"I ordered Nature's Way 5-HTP, and the product itself is great. I wish I could say the same thing about the vendor that filled this order. A week after I placed my order, I received an email asking me to rate their service and product. Since I hadn't received my order, I didn't leave a rating. After two weeks and still no 5-HTP, I left a message with the Direct Super Center asking for a status. I never received the courtesy of a reply. Finally, after another week, my order arrived. So again, great product--but you may want to consider another vendor."
1,Caused Insomnia,"I like 5HTP and I especially like that it makes you drowsy. However, for some reason, this particular brand caused me to have insomnia. It mentions that insomnia could be a side effect, which is strange, as I do not see that listed as a side effect on any other brands."
2,Made me ill,"I was looking forward to trying this product, and will probably try it again in the future. For now though it is no good for me. The product says on the back to not use if you have IBS or a variety of other digestion issues which I did not recall seeing when I purchased the bottle. Well, it really means that! So if you have indigestion or IBS with stress/depression/anxiety as its root cause seriously rethink this product. I have used GABA (750mg 2x day) and L-theanine (200 mg 2x day), Fish oil (2600 mg 2x day) combined with a morning dose of a B complex and calcium, magnesium, zinc vitamin mix (from the grocery store) with great results in lieu of this product. Also, I have been using Valerian (1600 mg all at once an hour before bed) and it squashed 95% of my morning nausea that my doc had been treating practically overnight. Keep in mind though all this is consumed to treat PTSD, not your garden variety edginess/depression... Hope this helps someone else who needs a product like this."
1,This is a Scam and Amazon should be notified.,"Amazon should seriously Remove this DVD from their list, it is of the lowest standards possible. It mentions basically nothing about Aristotle apart from a few low res images downloaded from the internet and displayed in a powerpoint. The same goes for the 'human brain' poor quality images taken from the internet no real content. This is by far the worst thing i have ever bought in my entire life."
4,Vancouverites that don't suck,"All of the songs on here are going to knock you flat on your...ah...back. The best song on the album is ""Talk S***"". Though they do sound like a Canadian version of SoCal punk rock, they seem to rise far above it. Dump your NOFX album, punk, and get this."
5,my son loves it!,"my son loves his dog and sleeps with him every night. we've owned two in the last 9 months b/c his grandma's dog got ahold of his stuffed dog and ripped it in two places so i just replaced it. so i am not sure how long the musical wind-up key will last. however it has lasted so far and that's after nightly use. ALSO i know from experience with his sister's wind-up teddy bear that if you put them in the washing machine (which is not recommended anyway) then it will stop playing music. at least ours did.*update 07/04/2009i've owned this for about a year and a half and the music box has stopped working. very disappointing considering that this was originally bought as a replacement to a pink dog i owned as a baby that my son got attached to when he was a baby, that the music box only stopped working in after about 20 years. things aren't made like they used to be."
3,Music box stopped working,We had the same experience as the other reviewer. This was a favorite of our 22 month old son until the music box stopped working. I'm ordering a replacement hoping that it lasts longer than the first.
3,My son LOVES it but NOT durable!,"I've owned this for about a year and a half and the music box has stopped working. very disappointing considering that this was originally bought as a replacement to a pink dog I owned as a baby [that my son got attached to when he was a baby, that the music box only stopped working in after about 20 years.] things aren't made like they used to be.my son really loved this stuffed animal, got quite attached very quickly, so the fact that it no longer works is just so very disappointing."
2,Try again,"These weren't comfortable for me. I sent them back. With my feet, there was a large gap around the opening when I had them on. However, I did like the style."
1,I would rate higher if I had them!!!!,I order the Naturalizer Women shoes since November and I still have not received them.... I am very disappointed and that has put a damper on my ordering online again!!!!!
1,Ridiculous recording.,"Since Amazon has a tendency to move reviews around, allow me to specify: This is about the CD with Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto #2 and Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini played by Cecile Licad with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra conducted by Claudio Abbado.This recording is truly annoying. It seems that the performers have the sole intent of blowing your ears off--Licad pounds on the piano to make the loudest possible noise and the orchestra blares. This isn't merely a matter of a wide-dynamic-range recording; the loud passages are completely out of proportion with the rest of the music. This recording is from the early days of digital recording, so I suspect this was done to show off the medium. It does not serve the music, however. Mediocre performances otherwise, not worth the annoyance of the blasting."
5,awesome collection of greatest papers in statistics with precise introductions,"Knuth said, garbage in garbage out. These three volumes are absolutely treasure of statistics, forever. The excellent papers in the past 110 years are collected and introduced. Whatever for students or researchers, they are definitely valuable to be at hand.[1] The original papers are attached. Do you remember Abel said, Read the masters', not their pupils'?[2] For each important paper, there is an introduction written by the real experts of this domain.[3] This is a real awesome book that leads you to overview the history of statistics.[4] You can find a surprise of good price somewhere on campusi.com if you need all the three volumes."
5,Neither to the left nor to the right...,"A colleague and I were discussing the Greek notion of sophrosyne and its Christian counterpart sophronismos when he referred me to this book. I am thankful he did.First, this is an absolute must read for Christian pastors, teachers, and any interested in politics. Budziszewski's thesis that conscience is suppressed not absent is persuasive. The many examples of how far the mind will go to rationalize disobedience will give you insight into what is happening in the US and why.Second, I appreciate Budziszewski's distinctive call to Christian politics. Too many fall for the simplistic left-right or liberal-conservative paradigm when the Bible makes clear we are to turn neither to the left nor to the right.In conclusion, this book impacted me greatly and is right up there with Herbert Schlossberg's Idols for Destruction. If I could, I would make it mandatory reading in all my classes."
3,OK Strap,This strap will do the job and is made of leather. It is a little stiff and takes some breaking in
2,A Snagged/pealed wire in 9 months,"Pros:Balanced sound without too much bass. If you like that sort of listening experience. If you want more bass, go with a different brand because Shure is notorious for its balance, not bass.Cons:I only saw one other review with this complaint, and frankly I'm surprised. The issue here is that the thin cable leading up to the headphones, contours around your ears, and eventually this bending causes the frail wire cover to peal off thus exposing the bare wire.I gave these to my brother, a 27-year-old working in NYC, who uses these earbuds for no more than 3 hours a week during his commute. He takes care of them, but after 9 months, they had to be replaced under Shure's 2-year warranty (which they have recently reduced from 3 to 2 years...I wonder why?)For 200 bones, I would expect more durability."
4,Really nice Earphones. The nicest I have ever owned/used.,"OK, so I really wanted to upgrade these to a 4 1/2. They are great in everyway. I just feel that the company implied greater bass response than the earphones deliver. Don't get me wrong, they are great, they just don't live up to the hype.I bought them to use when I am mowing my orchard on a loud 27hp zero turn mower. They are amazing. After selecting the best earpieces for me, I can listen to my music the whole time I am mowing and just barely hear the hum of the engine in the background.Would I recommend them? Heck yes, as I said they are the best sounding and most sound isolating earphones I have ever owned."
4,"Nice Buds, but I like it louder!","First, I really dig the sound these ear buds put out. Second, they are the most comfortable ear buds I have ever tried. No ear fatigue or soreness after 5 hours of mowing my lawn. Speaking of which I use a loud riding mower to mow and these noise canceling ear buds cut out the mower noise 95%. I love them. The only thing I would improve is MORE VOLUME! I love it loud and even though the noise cancelation helps most folks not need to turn the music up, I like volume. Great buds. Oh yeah, my first set became full of ear wax from mowing in the summer with them. The right ear bud became clogged. I sent them back and got a brand new set from Shure! They were awesome! But they did warn me to keep them clean as they would not send me another free set if I clogged them again. I think that's fair!"
1,Wrong item shipped by Amazon :(,"Amazon shipped the wrong item to me! -- I specifically ordered the Shure SE310A-k Sound Isolating Earphones (Black) but Amazon Shipped to me: Shure SE310 WHITE.Unfortunately for me, I'm already overseas and there's no way for me to return the item back :(sigh..As for the product itself - good mid to high's. Good sound isolation. Sound Quality is like: Sein PMX100 but with Sound Isolation"
4,one of the better headache books,"second most effective book. the information in the book is right on. The best book is ""Heal Your Headaches""."
2,Not the Best Headache Book - Little Practical Advice ...,"The better book is Bucholz's Heal Your Headache which is the most no-nonsense, practical book out there. Breaking the Headache Cycle is mostly philosophical rambling about stress reduction and breathing with little useful advice. The chapter on the pros and cons of current medications is the only useful part of the book. The rest is fluff. If you check out the Bucholz book, you'll see what I'm talking about."
5,The GRX,"I loved this episode as a boy. What got my attention was the sound of the GRX, and the body design of the car. That engine sound gets me pumped! (...)"
5,A Masterpiece,"This book is simply a masterpiece, while written as a training guide, it actually has as much to do with how people learn, motivation, and focus . Probably the most complete book of its kind that Ive ever read. Sonnon has produced a work that belongs on every bookshelf."
1,complete malarky,"This book kept on cropping up on recommendation lists so I finally caved in and bought it.This is nothing more than a monumental collection of pseudo-scientific nonsense! I work in the academic world and see people try to pull this stunt from time to time...only to be shut down by an informed audience. I guess this trick works for Sonnon because of the buffer of the internet and his cadre of yes-men.To be fair, the last few pages are devoted to an attempt to describe tricky breakdance/gymnastic moves.I still get bombarded with Scott Sonnon/RMAX recommendations, but refuse to pay for another of these overpriced disappointments."
5,great book,this a great book. the exercises have helped my grappling immensely. they help me coordinate and relax my game.
2,It's O.K.,"As a Yoga instructor of 10 years, and a Pilates instructor for 3, I was much intrigued by some online reviews stating that this was the advancement of many advanced somatic methods made popular by greats like FM Alexander, and Joseph Huburtus Pilates.I was hoping that the marketing was correct and Scott Sonnon would be joining this crew.Sonnon has some good ideas, and a great entertaining style of communicating them. The approach, however, was somewhat lacking in depth. It seemed to have borrowed many bits and pieces from the thorough systems mentioned above, and piece them together attempting to appear new altogether. I found that this was not the case.Although I would recommend it to anyone wishing to gain a beginners understanding of proper biomechanical exercise, I would strongly hesitate to say that it is anywhere near exhaustive or as complete as the marketing would like to suggest.Happy Hunting."
1,Much Lingo,"I am very grateful for the developments of physical culture that have come to public consumption over the past decade. Pilates, Yoga, Strength, Flexibility, and Somatic traditions (Feldenkrais, FM Alexander, and Thomas Hanna are a few that come to mind).The author of this book would have you believe that he has transcended all of those who have come before them. I can say that I don't believe this to be the case. While there is much reference to principles of training that make sense, the author has created a multitude of catchy phrases and coined together common terms in the fitness industry to appear as if something new has been created.I was sorely disappointed by this book, and in it's place would recommend titles by Pavel Tsatsouline and Stott Pilates, both of which will contain the principles plus substance that you can immediately put to use."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I read Sonnon's other book, _Clubbell Training for Circular Strength_, and it is an excellent work. So I did not think twice about buying _Body Flow_.I can't help but think this book is some sort of inside joke on the part of Scott Sonnon and his business partners. He writes like he fights--he slips and slides so I could never understand what he was saying. The last 25% of the book is devoted to actual exercises, which were indeed neat. But in the end, the first 75% of the book just left me scratching my head and wondering if I had just been on the receiving end of a joke.As a purely cosmetic aside, in some cases, the text combines so many fonts that it looks like a ransom note...this took away from the professional look and feel of the work.Again, Scott Sonnon is a brilliant sportsman and has the potential to be a great communicator...if he steps back to whatever he did differently during his ""Clubbell"" days."
5,Sick and Blistering,"If you love brutality and speed, don't miss out on Insane Cephalic Production by Benighted. If you dig the guttural vocal style, you'll love this no doubt. You may have heard of 7 bands that have this name, but this CD is by the most respected and my favorite Benighted, the one that hails from France.I seriously have nothing more to say about this album other than if you love brutal deathgrind, this is a must. For fans of Aborted, Illdisposed, Skinless, and Dying Fetus."
1,Boatbuilding By Chapelle---Confusion for a Newbie,"I think this book has a place in a complete boatbuilding library but, as a beginner, it uses terms that are unknown to most newbies. I think this book will be more helpful when you are further along in boatbuilding and perhaps have built a simple boat or two. It does have some classical appeal to it being written by a legend in the boating commmunity and therefore I feel it is a good purchase, just don't buy it as a newbie thinking your going to learn how to construct a boat cold turkey with this book as a guide."
5,an all time classic,"utterly superb book. Have just started to read it a second time.No this is not about the new lightweight stitch and glue wonder designs, but boats still need to stay together.Goes into detail about framing, joints, engines hatches, ventilators, winches and more and more and more.Utterly packed with detail, unbelieveable detail. This is the book that tells you how to do things. In 200 years people will still read this book, that is how good it is.Cannot recommend it highly enough"
4,Well written tombe for beginner or old salt.,"This is a must have book, recommended by Traditional Wooden Boat Building schools. Though a good seamanship and shipwrigth vocabulary or glossary at hand is essential, for the most part this is reader friendly book to the amateur and professional alike.A standard, that should be on every would-be or current wooden boat builder's shelf."
3,Don't let my three star rating turn you away from this book.,"Don't let my three star rating turn you away from this book. It is well written, complete in every sense of the word and well illustrated. I gave it three stars because I found other books on this subject to be more readable and easier to use as a guide and reference. This is a text book style work and it has a great place in all the books on boatbuilding. It is a fine work, but then, I must ask you, how many fine books can there be? What if I said that this was yet another fine boat building book...then what? This book makes a wonderful reference. It makes an excellent text book. It is useful if you have more than two people working on a hull (one to read aloud and the other to work). But it is not an easy, cook book on boat building. I recommend it, But there are other books out there that are better sources of information for the home builder."
1,Uninteresting story,Story was uninteresting. I could not wait for the movie to end. The main character is just not believable. I was disappointed because I think Charlize Theron is a great actress. The script was just too poor for her to save it.
2,Fine acting,"The acting was fine. I was expecting something a little lighter, so maybe it's my expectations that make me think they were going for something they didn't quite get. They seemed to be presenting information (spoilers) - the mental health issues mixed with the alcoholism and everybody in town knowing about it except the main character and Patrick Wilson's sister's encouraging behavior (not a well-written character - too obvious with her sycophantic behavior) that finally points the main character into realizing how lucky she is not to live there (too easy). But there is no resolution to any of it and it makes very little sense (I suppose they were trying for a little slice in the life of a mentally unstable person). They also throw Patton Oswalt's character in like a bone for a dog, so to speak, to show how really selfish and self-involved she is and yet totally confused."
2,not original not funny,I really like Charlize but this movie was made for the stay at home mom who is tired of watching day time soaps.
1,Really bad movie,I never rate things but I must save people from thinking this is a funny movie like we did! It was so sad and uncomfortable that my husband and sister have taken away my movie choosing privleges for a month! Total waste of time. Not funny and I'm not sure how they bill it as such.
2,My granddaughter was not thrilled with it.,"Generally I like Paula Danziger's books, but my granddaughter wasn't thrilled with this one. There is so much pressure on kids to conform in school that it's harder these days to appreciate that non-conforming has any value except to get you in trouble. The message isn't as cool as it used to be."
4,amber brown,"this is a good book for children 10 and older. the book is talks about divorces, bras, killings of barbie, and other stuff that may not be suitable for younder children. it talks about how amber is unhappy because her mom is dating a new guy and it seems to effect her school work. through her school work, she came to know her mother's boyfriend."
4,Amber Rocks!,I have read alot of Amber Brown books and this is my favorite so far. She a normal girl and learns to handle things-I really like to read about her!
1,Terrible Dinner Experience,"I am an experienced cook and was eager to try a recipie from this book that I received as a Christmans gift. I prepared the ""Savory Garlic Chicken Stew"" exactly as directed on page 92.What a terrible and tasteless dish. It was more of a soup than a stew, there was no taste of garlic, and even the chicken was bad. It made its way to the disposal!I hope other recipes in the book are better...but I will probably use the book to start my New Year's eve fire. At least it would be good for something."
2,"Intersting, but not in a good way.","I looked through this book, and didn't find one recipe that looked or even remotely sounded good."
5,Easy to use email program,I found Mass Mailer easy to use. I could send text or html messages. I could even merge custom fields with easy. The import function was easy. I recommed this program
1,They'll be rocking down at the senior center,"This si as swinging as Lawrence Wlk or Mitch Miller, come on now this is horrible lounge crap. Why not listen to Benny Goodman, Glann Miller or Artie Shaw, this cd sucks!!!!! Only some old fart who has no musical taste or class would buy this. Even my Grandpa doesn't like this, my Grandpa listens to Ellington and Basie. Enoch Light is for clueless bozos at senior centers, who are vegitables."
2,Drummer STINKS!!,"It sounded as if the drummer was not able to keep upwith the band. The band kept time, not the drummer.Punk must be tight!!!The last two songs ""The last cold i'll ever catch"" and ""face""were a mega improvement. I even liked them. Those songs had to have been played by some other drummer."
5,"Storage, laundry and wash tub - Tub!",I love the soft sided tubtrugs - this storage tub has so many uses at my house I am still figuring it out! Love all the tubtrug bucket!
4,Tubtrug,"Great purchase. Very versatile! I planned it for garden duty starting this spring, but it is already being used for all sorts of winter jobs."
5,tub trug!,You cannot go wrong with tub trugs and Ozbo is a perfect supplier. The tub arrived in no time flat. Perfect!
5,makes a great toy box,"I use 2 of these as toy boxes, love the range of colors. The child can reach in without opening a lid, and fall into the soft sides while learning to walk without getting hurt. Holds three or four stuffed animals and several books. Not childish so I won't have to throw them out as the child grows. I can use these in so many ways that they will long outlive their toy box function."
5,Excellent!,"Loves the products. Easy to carry, wash, and dry! Many way of use. I personally am using this bucket for wetsuits and fins. Color is stable as well"
5,tubtrug,These wonderful flexible units are a must. I plant flowers and require as bucket that is light and functional. try one!
5,Very useful for Recycling bin,"This works great of my recycled cans and bottles. Easy to carry with one hand on the way to the garage. Very sturdy and washes easily. Great product. To digress a bot, you can see that there are many vendors, including amazon. This product is cheaper than the same product sold by Amazon. This is a perfect example of how Amazon tells Prime members the shipping is free, but if you look at the price you will notice that Amazon's price is higher than all the rest. They raise the price the amount of the shipping, and then tell you shipping is free. This, to me, is unethical because we pay for Prime memberships and should not be charged additional for products that have the prime logo."
5,Beautiful (!!!) FM Symbolism--Treasured Collector's item !,"Even if you never intend to read this book, buy it for the Beautiful Symbolism ! This little Book has absolutely Astounding, Full-Color Pictures--many of-which I have never seen, before. The Book is worth owning for the picture of the RC Cross Apron, alone. However, the other Apron Photos are quite Fascinating. The Lodge pictures are beautiful. Anyone with any interest in Freemasonry will treasure this book. The Full-Color photos are amazing. This book was written by a French Mason, so some of the content will be new to others--but, the rest is Universal."
5,"When Henry talks, you listen!","It really doesn't matter if you have never heard any of Rollins' music, or you have and you didn't like it. His spoken word performances are the stuff of legend, and if you have never heard what he has to say, I suggest you start here. The opening story, ""The Adventures of an Asshole"", is not for the faint of heart, but it will make you laugh your *&* off, as will all his stories. Buy It!"
4,Everything You Need To Know To Live Victoriously,"The author of this book was not only saved in Dr. Lake's church in Portland,Ore.,he also traveled with Dr. Lake and stayed in his home, where he was healed of deadly food poisoning while reading these very sermons. Gordon Lindsay also pastored Dr. Lake's church in Texas for a while. The beauty of this book is in the fact that Lindsay did not add to or take away, he just published. These sermons by Dr. Lake are probably some of the best I have ever read. One sermon (p.75) tells you exactly how to know AND do God's Will, and how to be led by the Holy Spirit. As The General Overseer of Dr. Lake's organization, I have made this book mandatory reading for all our Bible College students, Ministerial Candidates, and Healing Room Personnel and patients. This one is a MUST READ."
4,Faith In Action,"John G. Lake's ministry was a shining example of faith in action.Lake's successful prescription for healing can be found in THE JOHN G. LAKE SERMONS. His habit of repeating the principles of his teaching makes the book fairly easy to understand. Lake continuously stresses that the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus can keep us free from disease. He considers Divine Healing to be a matter of faith and the Grace of God. The Spirit of God is as tangible as electricity and is available to all who accept Jesus Christ as personal lord and healer. It is more important to trust in God than it is to try to get a healing.According to Lake, healings were numerous during the first four centuries of the church before the reign of Emperor Constantine. The gifts of the Holy Spirit were revived during the reformation because of Martin Luther's influence and his emphasis on faith."
4,Well worth buying,"Contrary to some of the other reviews of this DVD, I am enjoying it more than sufficiently. The Jeff Watts and Horacio Hernandez segments make this of more than the usual level of musical interest for an MD Festival DVD. Having real ensembles playing actual music (and very intricate, interesting music, at that) is a refreshing break from the usual gymnastic soloing that makes up the bulk of these discs, most of the time. The segment with John Riley is most interesting as well. Three REALLY interesting segments is as good as these MD festivals get, so I say--go for it! You will find a great deal of musical interest here."
2,Talent is going down the toilet,"I finished watching the DVD except for the Disc 2 morning session. First, I hardly recognize the drummers on these discs. I did recognize Hernandez since he has already appeared on past modern drummer sessions. It seemed the group he brought in played forever. They should have named this the Hernandez Modern Drummer Festival. It must be getting harder to find drummers to play at these events based on this years crop. The only player I enjoyed was Watts. He truly has mastered the art of making drums sound like a musically instrument. The morning session on DVD 1 was not very good. I thought the lesson was kind of too basic to be put on a DVD. Unlike in previous years there was bascally no discussions on technique. Just a bunch of drummers playing mostly to pre-recorded tracks. I haven't looked at the PDF's yet. If they are good maybe it is worth getting."
4,How to pray the psalms with confidence and love,"Dietrich Bonhoeffer, hung by the Nazis for his principled resistance to perversion of Christian life, leads us through the themes and value of psalms. These song-prayers, brought forth from thousands of years of human longing for connection with God, are just as powerful in their meaning of human life, today. Use this tiny volume as a study guide to psalm themes for better prayer life."
3,Great book - Numbers are NOT searchable on Kindle,"This is a great book. You can't search by numbers on this book though. Which is disappointing since if you want to see what is written about Psalm 23 (for example) if you do a search for ""23"" it will not turn in any results."
3,Great Historical Research Book,This book is a detailed historical account of the banjo manufacturers in the USA. It is not a particularly easy read. If you're looking a narrative story of the individual makers I didn't find it here. This is more of an academic research project. I'd highly recommend it if that is your area of interest.
3,"Great sound, but awkward controls","This radio has a good digital clock readout, but it is not a digital radio. Once you get a station the sound is very good, and controls for the clock are right up front, but I always have to check the side for the proper on/off setting. Those side buttons are small, and you have to turn it from side to side to be sure you have it right. Also, plastic casing seems insubstantial."
5,Trumpet Mouthpiece puller,"My young trumpet player is forever getting his mouthpiece stuck. I got tired of bringing it to a music store. This was a good value, and saves me time since he can pull it himself. Didn't scratch the trumpet."
5,Mouthpiece stuck again,This remover did the trick! Hopefully my teenager will learn to be more careful with his trumpet! Thank you for a sturdy tool
1,VERY Dissatisfied,"I bought TWO of these and they DO NOT WORK. They WILL NOT format on a PC or a MAC. My friend, a technology teacher, tried to format them and they would not format or erase. They would not accept any files. I bought a replacement, ""SANDISK Cruzer 8GB"" and it works GREAT. It's FAST and much smaller. My best choice."
1,another surprised customer,"this tv wa on it's way to getting 5 stars, but after less than 2 months it turned off, and wouldn't stay on after for not even a second. it would just turn back off. i returned it with no problems, but i lost the dvd that was stuck inside and wouldn't come out. i was mostly dissapponted becuase i loved the tv, but if it's not going to work, then what else can i say?"
1,Toshiba,"I Purchased this TV at the end of February and within a few weeks it would not work. It switches on for a second then off, not even time for the picture to come on! I tried different outlets which work fine with other appliences but not the TV. I called Toshiba as requested in the manual and they put me in touch with a local TV repair as it was under warranty. No Luck.Another Toshiba place (50 miles away)I was asked to bring the TV in to them! This is a heavy TV set!! I then tried returning this item to Amazon who would not accept it because it was now more than 30 days since it was purchased. My advice, buy where you can return or have a local service company available. I also give Amazon -* minus stars for service."
1,Horrible,"I thought the quality would meet the one found in Sony's Trinitron, but hell the standard definition for this small size looks WAY BETTER. The convergence is bad and unsettable, and overall picture is washed and overforced. If they think that is what consumers want, I'd rather declare them insane and buy a cheaper but a better and more natural product than this one."
3,SPEAKERS,"I love this tv, but I would like to add more speakers. I am thinking wireless. Is there something I can use for this kind of tv?"
5,Are YOU ready for a challenge?,"Wow, what a game! I thought motocross madness 1 was good! The new things this has ROCKS! You don't have to know anything about anything. If you love action games, simulation games, and somewhat realistic (more or less) than this is for you! I just happen to love crashing. Think I like it? The AI in this is really good too. On every mode you choose, (stunt quarry, Enduro, National Race, supercross, ect.) it has the computer players difficulty. You can have up to 10 computer players wrecking the place. The other thing I would love to mention are the 3D objects. The places you choose all have unique objects such as trees, tractors, barns, water towers, observation towers, ect. It also has MOVING objects! Things like : cars, semi's, truckes, trains, ect. And they can hit you too! Go get it and you WILL see what I mean!"
5,Motocross Madness 2 Is The bomb,This game is simply the best in motocross racing for the pc The graphics look so real and the stunts are so death defying it is awsome I suggest that all motocross lovers should go and get thei game!
2,Very buggy on today's machines,"Graphics are still nice even today. Strangely, the game becomes virtually unplayable on today's hardware as game breaking graphicglitches and sound bugs show up very often. These problems alone push it a couple notches from being a top game now. Further dropping it down, are the unresponsive controlling of stunts. One is very lucky if buttons work in time to avoid trouble. Though never reaching a five star rating Motocross Madness 2 had its day...several years ago."
5,The most awesome game.,"This is the best game I've ever played. The graphics are awesome. The different bikes are cool. 125,250,400,500,600. The only bad thing is there aren,t any pro riders, unless you become pro yourself. The career mode is a little hard. You,ll never get bored. Giant crazy 400ft natural doubles. Get this game."
1,Okay at first,"When this game arived, i was stoked. The game was a blast at first, but after about a week, it got boring. This is more of a simulator than a game. You go higher than real life, but that's it. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!! You'll get bored within a week. TRUST ME. If you think you'll like it becuase you bike, you won't. Don't waste your money on this game."
2,"Great potential, lacking","Don't get me wrong, this game isn't that bad, but there are quite a few things that I don't like about it. For one, you can only do so much stunts, that they get boring very quickly, and in no time you would get bored of the current event you are doing.There are several game types that you can choose from, like Stunts, Baja, and some others that let you go through courses. These aren't that fun, for me.I don't have much to say for this game, except I would not want anyone to get it, maybe if its in the bargain bin for 1.99.."
3,Not what I thought it would be from a racing game,"I am disapointed in this game because you really aren't playing to win anything. They give you all the bike's and all the tracks, so what do you have to look forward to getting? I have played this game with many different bike's, but can never seem to finish first. I like racing game's and would never recommend this one for anyone. The graphics are good, but that's all this game really has going for itself."
5,Look At This!,I hope I got your attention because if you don't by this game you are insane. I don't like all those racing games out there and I especially don't like dirt bikes but since I played the demo of this game I was hooked! Check it out for yourself.
1,does this fit,Norelco Shaver Speed-XL Head HolderI can not find if this item is the one i will need so can you tell me. Does this item fit HQ9 philishave speed XL. As it does not tell you on the item Thanks Neil
5,Perfect Replacement,"One of the heads on my razor kept falling out. I bought this head holder and it fits and works perfectly. Actually, it may work better than the old head holder because I've been getting much closer shaves (go figure!) There is another bonus to this. It is black instead of chrome immediatedly around the heads, so it makes my razor look like a new one to me. Sounds funny, but it really looks nicer now."
3,Does the job I needed as the original one failed,"I orignally ordered the replacement heads, and found out that was just blades, so I had to order this to get my razor working agian."
2,"Skip this and go right to ""Message to the Young""","This as you can tell from the other reviewers is an attempt by Chess records to update one of their most influential artist's sound so that a rock audience may start buying blues albums. It doesn't work. The reason it doesn't work is simply because this is basically a reworking of all of the Wolf's greatest hits. These tracks don't even sound like they were mixed properly. If you listen on the headphones, you hear Howlin Wolf singing but instead of him singing with musical accompaniment, he sounds like he is singing inspite of it. The guitar and especially the drums sound like they were simply taken off a Cream or Hendrix album. Not a good job mixing is the point.If you want to hear better versions of these songs, just get ""His Best"" or find the ""Chess Box"".This album is worth skipping and going right to ""Message to the Young"" which contains both an updated sound AND new songs mostly written by the album's producer Sonny Thompson."
1,True magic in ADVERTIZING !!!!,"""This is Howlin'Wolf's new album. He doesn't like it. He didn't like his electric guitar at first either."" That's the blurb they use to sell this album and it worked on me. Well stupid me! The album sucks Totally, most songs are unreconizible. You can find much better versions on other collections. You can learn to come to grips with your electric guitar but not with this album.Howlin' Wolf: His Best (Chess 50th Anniversary Collection)"
1,SACRILAGE,"I hate it as well.There is nothing modern in these ridiculous recordings.Adding 'wah,wah's'is what many record producers did late sixties (listen to later recordings by Jimmy Reed ,Lightnin' Slim eg)but for what reason?.Naturally they were giving in to the ultra conservative bodies who wanted to dilute and 'clean up'the recording industry which by this time late sixties had become one whole of a commercial mess.Remember that ten years earlier these same people were breaking rock'n'roll records on TV because the music was 'the Devil's music'.Listen to the original recordings instead and if you don't like them then buy something by Eric Clapton but then his music is not the Blues ."
5,The Wolf didn't like this album,The Wolf didn't like this album and neither did the critics at the time but I sure do. Fuzzy loud guitars weren't Wolf's thing I guess. This album was briefly released in Japan on CD last year but is now out of print. Too bad because we get a nice updated sound for the Wolf.
1,"Wolf didn't like it, neither did I","This album is so bad that it is almost offensive to Wolf's classic Chess recordings. This approach to music doesn't suit this artist, unlike Muddy's ""electric"" albuns, maybe because Muddy Waters showed to be more flexible and versatile than Howlin' Wolf along his carreer (which is not necessarily a good quality), and Muddy's songs weren't so ruined on his versions. The classic songs are defiled here, and Wolf does not seem confortable on his vocals. Also, the album package by Cadet Concepts is very poor, with almost no cover information. A classic album for collectors to exhibit on the shelf, away from the CD player."
1,Straight into the dumpster,"With all due respect to the other reviewers who seem to be trying very hard to find a way to defend this album...it's crap. If you know any of Howlin Wolf's best work for Chess you can't help but feel bad for him when you listen to this pile of sludge. the man did NOT need 1960s production and a hip/funky rhythm section to be amazing. this is a guy who could walk out on a stage, stand still with no instrument and blow the crowd away. it's a insult to his talent to drown his matter-of-fact vocal performances in a pile of electric crud. avoid it. those of you who have found a way to justify the existence of this mess, just ask yourselves this: if this album had never been released, would it matter to the world? allow me to answer for you - hell no"
4,A good short overview.,"This book is a quick overview of behaviours of children with Asperger's that might be seen in school, and strategies to work with them.This book has been very useful to me. It takes less than an hour to read, so I don't feel bad about offering it to my daughter's teachers at the beginning of the school year, and I go through it first and underline things that pertain to my daughter. I've done this for three years, and all three teachers have said they found it helpful. I'm donating the most recent copy I bought to the school."
1,I never received this book!!,"I am very disappointed, my address was not changed on time,the book was sent, returned, and I was charged for a book I did not receive!! I have contacted the seller and Amazon several times to receive a refund OR mail me the book and I will pay AGAIN the cost of postage. The company has my new address. I changed it within 5 min. of ordering and they said it was too late!?? I really wanted this book!! I am a school teacher with special needs children and I am always trying to read to help me be a better teacher."
5,An excellent overview of a complex subject,My son is newly diagnosed with AS. I bought this book to share with his new teacher. We have both found the book to be informative and an excellent resource for working with our little Aspie.
5,I have been taking these herbs for years,"I have been taking these herbs for about 15 years (Multi-Herb + Multi-Fiber), one of each every night. I rarely take vitamins, and maybe it's coincidental but I rarely get sick -- maybe a cold once every 5 years or so."
4,Witty and Stubborn,"I love the main character ""Ellen"" wittiness. She is not afraid to say exactly what comes to mind. I suppose you can say I'm hooked as I already bought another book of hers ""Mrs Drew Plays Her Hand"". This author keeps you anticipating the next scene. I have really enjoyed reading her books. Clean easy reading that keep you on your toes and in your book."
4,Great product,"This item proved to be exactly what I needed to fix that pesky problem in my car. The item arrived faster than I thought it would since Amazon decided to ship it separately. It was just as advertised - new, in excellent condition. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought it should have come with the gasket.All in all, it saved me at least 2 months of waiting time and $1000 from the dealer."
1,Traffic Meter not as advertised,"This program claims in the company information to provide data such as which pages visitors entered through, which referrers sent visitors, and what keywords brought viewers to your site. What you get is a ""lite"" version for which you must purchase a ""professional"" upgrade to get the features advertised! It provides the basics, but not the bells and whistles promised. It was a rip-off."
5,"If you at all like acoustic music, this is for you!","I helped bring Justin Roth and Chris Cunningham to the University of Dubuque coffeehouse this past April and they were fantastic! I bought this CD and ""Two Forms of ID"". Roth is a superb guitarist and vocalist. When he plays the last track of this album, he's not picking or strumming, all of it is done with hammering and plucking on the fingerboard! I saw it live and it was sweet! Even if you were unaware of that, the whole album demonstrates his guitar ability. The songs are very cool, yet they can be used as background music if you want. Very good album, excellent artist!"
3,Buyer Beware !,Do your homework on hardware compatibility. While you may be able to run Microsoft's analysis tool during install which is supposed to alert you to any problems with existing hardware ... it does NOT work in all cases.Good luck !
2,Too many issues,"After dealing with a number of driver issues I went back to XP (Built a new system about 3 months ago). It's not a bad product if it comes preinstalled on a new machine, but if you are looking to upgrade I would not recommend it.I also hated the new look. I find it very ugly and realy hope that Mircrosoft, or anyone else, comes up with some new visual styles for it. I might try insatlling it again a year or so from now once manufacturers catch up with their drivers and software."
3,A little bit of history?,"Never used it, but more to keep a memento. At the time, it was not apparent that Vista would be so rejected by the market (I still think it was better than Windows XP, but nowhere near as great as Windows 7!)"
3,It's Windows,"windows visa is not for everyone, I had a little problem installing due to the product being an upgrade vers a full, but overall I am happy with my purchase."
1,not ready for prime time...,this sucks. NO compatibilty slow and it freezes even though my computer is brand new and waayy more than required to run vista.dont do it!
5,"Awesome OS, and smooth upgrade!","I've been running the RC2 since it was released, and I never had a single problem. I upgraded to the official release on 1/31/07, and the installation took exactly 1 hour and went flawlessly. After a week, I am so happy with my system. I'm running 2 big LCD displays off of a 512MB ATI graphics card with 2 TV Tuners, and I feel like there is nothing better than relaxing on my PC when I get home. (I have the monitors at the foot of my bed, a microphone extending from the wall to run the voice command, and a wireless keyboard/mouse setup). Vista makes life a little more worth living. If you're enthusiastic about your PC, and proud of its performance, Vista is a must."
1,useless upgrade,"Microsoft should not be selling an upgrade version of Vista. If you do not have a new machine with it installed, you are wasting your money. Stick with XP."
1,Never shipped..,"I thought this would be cool to have, but when it didn't ship the day Vista was released, and I could get an unsigned version for $100 less elsewhere, I figured - what the heck, Bill G. doesn't need any more of my money and cancelled the order."
5,Good upgrade,"At first I was only marginally impressed; at first glance, Vista looks like mainly aesthetic upgrades. But then I started really DOING stuff. Moving files around, ripping DVDs (ones that I own, I promise), playing with Media Center... this is where Vista shines. Overall performance is just better, especially with hard drive-intensive tasks. Thumbnails are drawn faster, files are copied faster, multi-tasking is faster, you name it. Plenty of other tasks are made easier, too. While Apple is fooling around making OSX shinier and adding idiot features (Time Machine???), Vista is making your computer work better. Anyway, it's too much to get in to here, but I would definitely say Vista is worth the purchase. Oh, and if you have an Xbox 360, you'll definitely want one of the Vista versions with Media Center. It's awesome.(Psst, little tip: rename .vob files to .mpg and your DVD rips will play through Media Center and Media Player. Very handy if you make lots of, uh, backups...)"
5,The Eureka Stockade,"I have two copies of this book in paperback.It is an outstanding story by one of the participants.I call this event, Australia's Alamo.The outcome was different but the results were the same.Basically the small guy fighting for his rights against the big guy.The fight for Freedom!This is a must for all such libraries."
3,OK for light use,"The strap features solid canvas, good hardware and is nice and light. It does not dig into your shoulder. However, it has a major flaw for everyday use: the stitching at the ends of the pad to the strap is weak. After awhile, it WILL slowly come apart.If you're going to have it over your shoulder occasionally or for short distances, no problem. I bought two of these and each lasted about 5 months of walking a half mile twice a day carrying a 7 pound bag."
1,Teach Yourself VISUALLY Photoshop Elements 4 (Teach Yourself Visually),It was hard to use and understand.
2,adequate scholarship but not my type of research.,"The author conducted extensive research about the pronunciation of English in Austria. While there is nothing to be said against an empircial approach the author offers a lot of facts but does not discuss the underlying socio-political problems. Thus, the book offers some interesting raw-data (""word-counting"" linguistics!) but fails to adress the larger issues."
3,Dell Latitude D610 Battery,What can I say? Its a Battery and you gotta have one if you want to take it mobile.Fast shipping and works great.
1,Does not last,I bought this battery at the end of July and today is December 10th. The battery no longer holds a charge for more than 5 minutes. Not a good purchase. It did not even last for six months. A total waste of money.
2,Product ok seller not!,"I received the product, laptop battery, on time it did work no problems but then the product became useless to me because that was not the problem so I asked for a refund. I product was not used it was returned in the same condition but the seller did not refund all that I paid for the product!! What a scam!!"
2,ms . kathy,I hoped it would be better then my old battery but it doesnt hold a good charge either. But what can i do i took that chance when i ordered it.
2,SUCKED,"The battery in the beginning seemed good but as time went on the battery didn't last as long and within 8 months it completely died tried contacting the company no response DO NOT PURCHASE, YOU'RE WASTING YOU MONEY"
1,Didn't work for our laptop.,"I don't know if we ordered the wrong thing or what, but it wouldn't work in the laptop we ordered it for. I need to send it back."
1,"Bad Battery, Bad Battery","Battery worked well for 7 weeks and then died, kaput, dead. Techorbits has only a voice mail and they DO NOT RETURN CALLS as promised. I am going to try At BATT. This is one instance where buying from Amazon in stead of directly from a provider has not been a good experience."
2,please read this....,"This battery only stays charged for about a half hour. The other day I unplugged the charger from the back of the computer and the computer shut off, should'nt it stay on for a few hours? I am not a big user of my computer, maybe four hours week but it is plugged in 24 hrs. a day unless I take it downstairs. That is how I realized it does'nt stay charged. My old battery stayed charged that long, I would not have bought this if I knew I would have gotten the same results."
2,Keep shopping around,"Okay. Like others, I am disappointed with the life: about 2 to 3 hours tops. I feel like I should be able to get more from a new battery at the price. I suggest you keep shopping around."
2,A cheap product,"I bought this because the price was low. I found that product itself was cheap. The problem? It failed to read the card the moment it was inserted. In fact, it did not read at all. I had to finally unplug and replug the cord to the docking station to make it work. Does not matter what type of memory card you use (I used both SD and CompactFlash.) I am going to purchase a more solid product by paying $10 more."
1,A dud for me. Would not read SD cards.,"I like the cool blue LED and the size, but...I struggled for about 20 minutes to get this to recognize any of my SD cards. I pushed, tried moving the cards sideways, but nothing. Finally (!) it read the card, and was very fast. But...when I took that card out and tried to load another - nothing. I like my Kingston memory cards, but this doesn't seem to be of the same quality. Other reviews are moslty positive, perhaps I just had a bad unit. Frustrating. Returned it."
3,"Nice reader, but no xD?","I didn't read the description carefully enough, as I incorrectly assumed that a 15-in-1 reader would include xD. With the millions of Olympus and Fuji cameras out there it seems strange to omit the format from what is otherwise a very nice reader."
5,Great deal for the price,"I have owned this item for just over 3 months, and have had no problems at all. Reads the cards just fine, have had no errors or loose fitting slots. Overall for $15 it serves it purpose, and performs well. No complaints.There is no adaptor for the mini sd card."
4,Satisfied User,"This handy little item works exactly as advertised. I will accept any of the memory chips currently in use with digital cameras. Of course, it can be used to both read and write to any of those memory chips for any other purpose as well. It is USB II and very fast. It is simplicity personifid."
3,classic,"you should buy this album just for the first 3 songs, no ones gonna love you is the song you play to show that person that you really love them. weekend girl is the song you play when you want to spend the weekend with that person. just the way you like it is just the contiuation of just be good to me. i am here to tell you those 3 songs alone are the bomb. after that it kinda goes down hill. had the album and played those 3 songs all the time. again classics."
5,"After the passage of a quarter century, the album is still as fresh as ever!","""Just the Way You Like It,"" released in 1986, was The SOS Band's fifth studio release and brought them R & B success after being paired with uber-producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis who were riding a crest of success with the likes of Alexander O'Neal, Cherrelle, and, most notably Janet Jackson.The seven-track disc starts off with the still-powerful trilogy of ""No One's Gonna Love You,"" ""Weekend Girl,"" and the title track. Each segues into the other, making for a romantic medley that's right on the mark.The success of this album and its style brought international recognition to not only the band but the producers as well, leading to greater chart rankings for the group's successive release, ""The Finest.""Like the title says, this album IS ""Just the Way You Like It."""
5,Dig It!,"Great songs! Wow...1984 was certainly a very good year! ""Just the Way You Like It"" (84') an excellent follow-up to ""On The Rise"" (83'). IMHO.... ""Feeling"" may be the best work on the entire album. Check it out!"
5,Just The Way We I Like It! SOS,"This was my first SOS Album to come across. I remember, i would come from school, and the first thing I would do was play ""Weekend Girl"". My favourite song in the entire album. I did not pay much attention to the other songs, but suddenly realised, that I also liked the song ""Just The Way You Like It"", and especially how the ending led into the beginning of ""Weekend Girl"". Soon the other songs were favourable, and mostly ""I Don't Want Nobody Else"". Those Guys can sing, Jason Bryant can sing! that is one of their best songs, and it quickly earned my respect. If anyone with this album has ignored this song, please pay attention. You will love it. I promise. Unfortunately, this Album, particularly on CD is almost impossible to come by. I paid a dear price for mine, but it was worth, adding to my collection of rare and very special music! Get it if you can! This deserves nothing less than 5 stars! SOS Band, I don't want nobody else,nobody but you!!!"
4,Family cookbook,"The book is really 2 in one, it disoriented me a bit in the beginning but so far the recipes have pleased the family (i.e 4 people with 4 different tastes) which is quite an accomplishment. I like how it often gives you the full recipe and the shortcut. There are ideas for the lunchbox as well as for the slow cooker. Recipes do not have a ton of ingredients and many are listed as optional. Many cookbooks take for granted that you have a specialty store down the street, this one does not use fancy ingredients, therefore it is a pretty good source for last-minute dinner fixes."
4,GREAT!,"I love the way Yu Watase draws and for every Fushigi Yugi fanatic, this is a great book to get! I've been trying to learn how to draw and since I love the way Yu Watase draws, I had to get this book so I could get even more examples!"
5,Not your average historical romance! Amazing!,"The ultimate betrayal, murder, survival! How would you honor those who died for what was right? Beautifully written, heartbreaking story of revenge, honor, forgiveness and love!"
4,okay fluff,"For a light and frothy romance, this is a book with characters more three dimensional than usual. Part of a series of books involving a revolving family of characters, many introduced in her other works. Nice plot, decent writing. Readers who are into their romance novels will find this book more than acceptable."
1,Does not work. Don't waste your time.,"I have purchased two of these, and I feel like an idiot. I was told that the new version is supposed to work. BS. I did my homework, checked for compatibility and bought this and a stereo bluetooth device. Both were Bluetooth v1.2, A2DP, and 0000 or 1234 passcode compatible. Neither have worked. I have even tacked down friends with compatible bluetooth devices with no success. I give this 1 stars (because I can't choose 0). Good luck with the companies tech support = voicemail. No reviews = bad product (usually)."
3,It's a book,"It's a book for school just like any other. Has some good explanations in it. Some of it is confusing. Overall, it works for what I need it for."
2,book is okay to use.,"uhm... the book I get is still can use, but there are too much high light on my book"
1,The average speed of learning with this book is 0 m/s.,"This book is not at all helpful when trying to learn physics. By the time you get done trying to figure out this book and it's examples, you'll have pulled out all your hair. So my advice to if you're going to use this book is shave your head now to save yourself from the pain later. In all reality, I haven't learned anything from this book. It is very disorganized and the chapter problems are rediculous...what makes it better is the examples in the chapter don't correlated but with only a couple of chapter problems."
2,A little disappointed,"When I received the book and began reading thru the text I was excited. However, as I began to do the problems at the end of the chapter, I found that the text lacked an in depth explanation on the use of the formulas. Without a good instructor you would be hard pressed to solve most of the problems at the end. I have a GPA of 3.76 at one school and a 4.0 at another so I am a good student. I also aced my math classes including calculus. So my algebra for solving solutions is pretty good. So take it for what it's worth, but I was a little disappointed."
1,desperately disappointed...,"I read other reviews on this book that were similiar to what I'm about to say. I am an exemplary student with a 3.717 GPA. Furthermore, I am majoring in Physics. Any professor who intends to use this book for instruction to teach their enthusiastic science students, ought to have his/her head examined by a professional. The book is wildly presumptious about topics concerning the relations between the subject matter and knowledge and experience of the student. It assumes a foreknowledge of the subject matter by the student that the student couldn't possibly be equipped to handle yet. It lacks the gracefulness and flow that is so despertately needed when moving from one subject to another. It doesn't have a glossary of terms nor even so much as a list of commonly used physics formulas. Looks like I'll be using YouTube alot in order to learn what this book cost me $161.00 to learn. Very disappointing. Someone dropped the ball on this one for sure."
5,Instant Hit with Two Year Old!,"What a wonderful book! So simple, yet so fun. My squirmy two year old instantly loved it and insisted we read it time and again. I can tell it will be one of those books he spends time ""reading"" alone in his bed. Hope for more from Amy Allen!"
5,Classic devotional,"This is a classic daily devotional from the 19th century, with Bible Scriptures compiled on various topics. My grandparents read this every day and I grew up with my father reading it daily at breakfast. Now it's a habit of my own."
5,Best Devotional book on the market,Daily Light was written in the 1700s by Samuel Bagster. Through the years his family kept his papers and ultimately they were organized into this wonderful devotional book which was recommended to me by Anne Graham Lotz. Her family has used this book for years--Mrs. Lotz remembers her mother and grandmother using it and she uses it. There are many devotionals on the market but the unique feature about this one is that is totally Scripture. Each day's theme is composed of marvelously interwoven Scriptures from the Word of God. I think the Bible is the first and best book to read but I also feel this is the best devotional since it contains nothing but powerful Scriptures.
1,Warning to 360 Players,"This applies to anyone hoping to play this on their Xbox 360. Only select games from the original Xbox will work on the system. You can find backwards compatibility lists of which games games will and won't work on your system, all over the net. Turns out, the one I was checking wasn't accurate. Someone slipped ""The Warriors"" into the list as a joke, because it's highly requested.It's my fault for not double-checking, as I was in a hurry, but I've just blown money on a game I'll never play. So this is a heads-up to anyone else interested in playing the game in this way. It's not possible. The game, itself, is actually quite good. If you have a system that will play it, I recommend it."
1,OUT OF CONTROL.,"Out of control and out-dated. I pretty much never throw a game into the garbage, but this one was even cut-up first, then I through it in there, so nobody at the dump can get sad from playin' it. The Warriors art work is the only good thing about the game. The control is what makes me hate it, because you cannot move around easily when fighting, like all the other games."
5,You're gonna get Bopped!,"Awesome 2 player beat'em up. One of the last few games to come out during the Xbox's original run. Great film to game adaptation with some new creative touches that added to the original story. Along with a Kick Ass story you're fighting other gangs, tagging, beating up drug dealers, stealing radios, running to make it back to Coney Island. If you dug the other gangs in the film you're in for a treat. Rockstar brung some of the other gangs to the forefront.A SHAME not that many people played it. I'd love an HD remake with up to 4 player co-op. Maybe some online all-out gang fighting in the street. 16 on 16 would be heaven."
5,Best game ever,"If you own an original xbox - this is a must own game period. And I trust Amazon 100%, and shipped to my house in less than a week."
3,The sound from this heater makes it ok for garage use only,The sheet metal screws start to make noise mods will need to take place if you plan on office use.
1,Never Got this item!,"I haved ordered this item Reba's Christmas Collection (Slim). Last month. I never got this item. I got a different item, It was right around Christmas, I was too busy to mess with it. I was very disappointed, because I really wanted this collection. Instead I got a different Reba Christmas collection, that did not have the songs I wanted on there!"
5,Found my Old Family Christmas!,"I love this album, and my children, now grown requested for me to play this album for Christmas! Glad this seller had it available, and service was prompt, price was great!"
4,I had one for years and it was fine,"I had one of these for many years and used it almost exclusively for rice. I never had a problem. The only complaint I have is that it took awhile, other than that it made perfect rice each time. When it died, I bought a specialty rice cooker which never cooked rice as well as this, and I am looking to buy this one again."
4,please quit breaking down !,I've had 2 of these. The first I bought about 2 & 1/2 years ago. It lasted about a year then just would not heat the water. I finally called Black & Decker because I could not find another in all the stores I tried. They were very nice and sent me a new one. It died last week (at about 8 months old) It had bigger steaming containers. This new one looks even bigger. I prefered the small one. The previous 2 had the same base which was the heating element. Oh dear.....
1,Problems,"The timer on my unit only works sporadically, and the heating element in the reservoir actually rusted! Takes much longer to cook rice than any steamer should. Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!"
1,"Great when it works, but now mine is worth little","After using it just ten times or so, I found that the rice was not fully cooked at the end of the designated time. I'd have to steam it for another 20-30 minutes! Then, after using two or three more times, the timer stopped working. The great joy in this is setting it up to cook and being able to walk away and not worry about it. Ican't do that anymore. I'd look for a better made steamer.Also, the flavor scenter thing didn't work as they suggested. I never noticed any added flavor by placing herbs on the special flavor scenter insert. It just made one more thing to wash."
1,More trouble than it's worth,"After using this, I was surprised by all the positive reviews: I think it's more trouble than it's worth and not worth the counter space. *Don't* buy it if you are mainly after a rice cooker; as a rice steamer, it is time and use inefficient. And if you just want a veggie steamer, well, for my habits, using the microwave or stovetop, or my regular rice cooker works just fine.It's in my garage sale pile now."
3,Mine was defective,"I was interested in a rice steamer and found the description of this model to be impressive in that it cooks more than just rice. The first time I used it, it leaked all over the counter. Thinking I had filled the base too full, I tried it a second time, and again, it leaked. I contacted the service department and they were helpful in identifying a defective product. The good news is that I liked how it cooked. The rice I made was light and fluffy, not the sticky gooey stuff I get on top of the stove. I'm going to look for this product in a larger size as the rice bowl is a bit small for our family."
3,Mixed feelings,"I purchased this recently becuase my rice steamer died. I was looking for a replacement to steam rice & veggies. Now that I've used the B&D, I found the design poorly thought out. The double steamer made no sense and created soggy rice & veggies. That could have been partly becuase the water level is diffcult to measure for rice. There are only 2 levels to fill the water too which leaves little room for customizing. The cooking time seemed to take longer than other rice cookers I've had. To remove the steamed contentes requiers you to lift either the lid or the steam basket off in a way that your hands get burnt by the steam if you are not careful. I would not recommend this unless you are adept at steam cooking methods and like your items soggy."
3,"Great for veggies, not so great in other ways","I received this steamer as a gift from my dad after I melted my plastic strainer trying to steam green beans. It was a great idea on his part. The steamer does a great job with vegetables, even making spagetti squash with less hassle than a normal pan on the stove. Rice, I've found, comes out too wet for my liking, but I only tried that once. The main issue I have is there are so many parts to this thing that, since I don't have a dishwasher, it's somewhat of a bother to clean up afterwards. It's nice to clear up space on the stove, but it fills up a drying rack rather quickly. Still, a good little worker."
1,Dont waste your money,This stuff is awful. The lizards have no interest in it and they can't dig in it either.
2,Lovely designs but very conservative,"My rating is not about saying that this book doesn't show the designer to be incredibly skilled and inventive. It does. But on receiving the book I found that, for me, none of the designs grab me and I found them all way too conservative for my tastes, which I admit, run to the wild and wacky."
3,An Okay Book,"I know most people like this book, but I really didn't. The sweaters were very plain, like ones you can find most anywhere. Also, you can tell the author is a knitter at heart by the way some of her sweaters look--crochet makes a tighter, and therefore stiffer, fabric than knitting does so when a tight pattern is used a fluid yarn must be used, such as one with rayon. She used acrylic for these types and the sweaters seem to ""pucker"" as seen in the photos.There is one sweater that I love that I am going to make, it is an openwork pullover with a johnny collar in white and it is gorgeous. However, the other 24 just don't float my boat."
4,Fun Sweater book,"I found this book at the library and finally just bought one for myself. It is older but has a good variety of sweater patterns of different difficulty levels. I had never crocheted a sweater and I did an intermediate level one with good results. The instructions are fairly easy to follow with some experience. The only problem I had was that many of the suggested yarns are no longer available, so I had to figure out substitutions."
3,It's okay,"Always looking for books and patterns that have projects that don't look ""homemade"" . This book has several of those, but also not as many as I would have thought given other reviews.... I will probably use only one or two from the entire book.... was a little disappointed...so like I said it's okay... I would recommend other books more....see my other reviews on the subject"
4,Come with me To Guitar Island.....,"I meet the music of luna blanca by chance, im so glad that i chance was meant to be fate, luna blanca is talented band from sizzling percussion with beautiful spanish lead guitarist that wrapps their arms around sensual keyboard melodies, Guitar Island is beautiful album, its album that has most romantic songs with joyous lift that touches your soul, their music soothen your soul, holds you strong thru time, guitar melodies is beautiful and unforgettable with percussion that brings harmony to two soul dancing with each other, buy Guitar Island, see my other reviews youll find similar music reviews youll like, viva luna blanca...."
3,"Beautiful, Elegant Box","This is a beautiful box. I've had it for a couple of years. I would have given it 5 stars except that I don't approve of their 7 day return policy. Although I didn't need to return it, it's a matter of principle. In the U.S., the standard is 30 days--many businesses offer a longer period. If this doesn't bother you, then I recommend it. It's an elegant glass box with a vintage look."
5,Best Mill I've Ever Used,"Simply amazing pepper mill. Holds a considerable amount of peppercorns. Pretty easy to refill; I did use a small funnel to assist in getting peppercorns in the top. Easy to adjust size of grind. Action makes it very easy to turn and get a lot of pepper quickly. I am a big fan of freshly ground pepper, and I am seriously thinking about taking this to restaurants with me, for places that only have the pre-ground pepper shakers."
5,Unicorn Magnum Peppermill,"I have had several peppermills over the years and I bought this one from amazon in 2005 after Alton Brown praised it. I use mine everyday and we love pepper so it gets a workout. This is well worth the money and with customer service like theirs -- BUY IT!I am experiencing grinding issues that it won't grind finer. I called the company and explained the problem. Their customer service is outstanding and they are replacing the grinding mechanism at no cost, after 6 years! I can't tell you how much I appreciate this company standing behind their products and how well I was treated. They show you that they care about their customers, and we all know how rare this is now. THANK YOU UNICORN!!!"
1,Major Design Flaw,"I've just encountered the same problem with this 9"" model as several people have had with the 5"": after 2 years' use, the entire grind mechanism fell out of the mill, while I was using it, causing whole peppercorns to fall all over the food I was preparing (not to mention the kitchen counter, the floor, etc.). The grind mechanism is held in place by two screws that go into plastic posts molded onto the likewise plastic body. The thin plastic posts are not strong enough to withstand the torque of the twisting grind mechanism. A $50 peppermill should be heirloom material, not some fragile thing that turns into a completely unrepairable piece of junk because of this flaw. Based on reviews, I've just bought the William Bounds Pro, same size, for less."
5,Absolutely the best,"I could never find the perfect pepper mill until now. This mill is amazing, easy to grind, huge capacity and a lovely even grind. I love it and will never have to shop for another grinder."
5,Best I have tried & I have owned more than a few,"Easy to operate, even for old(isn) hands and holds a lot of peppercorns. We gave our original away to a daughter after many years of daily service, because she liked it so much. We can say it has been quite durable"
4,Okay,Works well except the adjustment knob keeps loosening during use. This causes the grind to go from fine to coarse. Kind of a pain constantly adjusting it back down. I gave one as a gift and the other one does the same thing. Must be a design flaw.-Jeepin Jesse
5,Durable and Easy-Use,It's been since December 2010 that we continue to love this pepper grinder. We have owned other (fancy) pepper grinders but this one beats them all in the easy-to-fill and easy-to-use categories. The price is right for the quality and durability. I hope they never discontinue this model. I would love to purchase another one (color purple would be nice).
5,Best Pepper Mill Ever!,"I bought this mill a couple weeks ago and it is easily the best one I've ever owned - and I've been cooking for 40 years. It indeed puts out an impressive amount of pepper with merely one turn (or less) of the handle. Certainly enough to adequately pepper a steak, a couple of eggs, or a salad. The grind is superior too, which shows that superior metal was used for the grinding surfaces. I am so delighted that I am going to order a couple more to have as spares."
5,Great tool; great company,"I bought this after reading a cook's illustrated review, and indeed it is the best pepper mill ever. I see that one person had a negative review because the plastic cracked and they had to throw the whole thing out. Oddly enough, I had a similar issue when my husband threw the pepper mill down in anger. Well, I didn't let that stop me from calling the company and asking if it could be revived. They sent me a new shell and life went on; husband learned to control his temper, too, and we continue to enjoy this GREAT pepper mill. If you don't have one of these, you should get one. I think I've had mine about 15 years!"
4,Good for cooking -- not for the dinner table,The mill produces a prodigious amount of ground pepper per turn. This is great when cooking but not so great at the dinner table.
4,The big black beast in the kitchen!,"Although the Unicorn Magnum Plus Pepper Mill leaves a bit to be desired as far as look, it truly is an amazing thing. The amount of pepper that is revealed after each grind, the ease of that grind, and the shear amount of pepper that this beast holds is outstanding. Although I still wish it looked like that little glossy red Peugeot that I wanted so badly, the performance is worth the look. The Peugeot that I tried in a fancy cooking store would never live up to this type of performance. I would suggest you suck it up and order this guy. You won't regret it."
5,It's ugly but it's also just a pepper mill,"Alton Brown loves this, Cooks Illustrated loves this and C. Runions loves this. It is the only pepper mill I've owned that hasn't broke. it also holds a bunch of peppercorns. It's just not pretty or visually pleasing at all. Really, buy this now and then invest in some Whole Sarawak Black Peppercorns. OMG, I know it's just pepper but man it's good stuff. Seriously this is a great pepper mill. It will probably last a lifetime. It's just that it's ugly..."
5,WOW!!,I have gone through a LOT of pepper mills in my day and this one is the best I have EVER used. I am buying one for most people for Christmas presents. I have not had a problem with the hole opening when I use it.
4,OK... They're right,"I downgrade by 1* only because the general appearance is not all that pleasing to me, otherwise other good reviews are right on. It loads easily through the gaping filler, is easy to handle (Even with my arthritic fingers), adjusts easily, & puts out a HEAPING amount with each turn."
4,"Works well, grinds fine, not as robust as it might seem, a good value at 1/2 the price?","I received this in order to replace a cheap failing mill. It indeed seems to work well, but if you have the impression that this is a heavy, built-like-a-tank peppermill, it may be less than impressive when it arrives. It is make of plastic and heavy enough that it will not crack when dropped, and fairly simple, stamped parts like any run- of-the-mill mill, and not any different kind of construction. Not a ""swiss watch"" by any means.It does a fine job at what it is supposed to do, but I find it very high priced (almost fifty bucks) for its in-hand observation of construction. It would be a fair value at half (or less) of the cost."
2,Not quite up to the hype. . .,"After reading the Cooks Illustrated review and the Amazon reviews, I would have thought this pepper mill would be flawless.- The build quality does not seem all that great.- The feel while grinding is not as smooth as I expected.- Adjusting the grind is via a teeny tiny little screw on the bottom, and it is hard to really get a fine grind.- I just plain don't like the way it looks. . . .All in all, I am unimpressed."
5,Great product...great service,"I've been looking for a high quality pepper mill for years...with the purchase of this product, the search has finally ended! Purchased this about three weeks ago and it was love at first grind!Folks, not only is the mill a winner, so is the company I bought it from: Chef's Tools (through Amazon). It was shipped promptly, well packaged and hit my door step long before expected. As with Amazon, I will do business with them in the future.Cheers,"
5,"Unicorn, where have you been?","At last, at last! After spending many hours in my kitchen for five decades, I finally have a pepper mill that WORKS as a pepper mill should! No more clogging, no more chasing peppercorns, no more trying to adjust the mechanism to get precisely the grind I want. Perfection is rare these days. But thank goodness it still exists in the creme de la creme of pepper mills! Hip, hip, hooray!"
5,Great Pepper Mill!,"We received this for a gift and I really think it works well. I love how easy it is to load and to set the type of grind you wish. I do wish it was made in other colors, but the mill itself works great! We would highly recommend it."
5,"Finally, a good grinder!","The search is over. This pepper mill is outstanding. It's copious output, adjustable grind size, and huge capacity put this grinder above the rest. It's easy to use and appears to be made to last.The only downside to this grinder is the filling port. It's large enough to make filling the grinder an easy task, but the rotating door that covers the hole can be moved to the open position during use, which results in pepper corns going everywhere. It's only happened once, but it was a mess."
5,"One down more to go, the best we have ever had","The first one we bought just died after about 5 years of daily use, many times multiple uses per day. This is by far the best pepper grinder we have ever had. I'm out here buying another, actually another two in case it is not available 5 years from now. The fact that I can still buy the same item after about 5 years says a lot. It holds a lot of pepper and adjusts easily. I do wish the filler rotated the other way but for the most part this is not a problem."
5,99.999% Perfect,"To think that I had been suffering the inadequacies of my previous, very expensive... $80++ as I recall... pepper mill for over 10 years, thinking it was the best I could do...Then I saw this pepper mill reviewed on America's Test Kitchen... so I decided to test it.Amazing. It holds a ton of peppercorns, but more importantly it grinds them perfectly. This is a precision instrument.Just be a little careful on your first use of it. It puts out a LOT of pepper with just a few twists. My first use opened my eyes.... WOW! ... this is really more than just good. You have to try it to believe it.And for a very reasonable price. I recommend it without hesitation."
2,Doesn't grind fine -- just big chunks,"I've had this peppermill for 2 years now and am giving up on it. A screw on the bottom [supposedly] adjusts the coarseness/fineness of the grind. I adjust the screw for a finer grind and inevitably, within 20 grinds, the peppermill reverts to big chunks of pepper. I want big chunks on a steak au poivre but I want fine for other purposes. There's something wrong with the ""hold"" on the screw, but I'm giving up. I can't understand why it's top-rated, with this defect."
4,"Glovalization, eh?","Chomsky gets into a lot in this book. Vietnam, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Cuba, and he even talks a bit about Israel/Palestine and other issues. The interviews span from the early '80s to '96, so there's a bunch of mentions of the horrible threat those big, bad Russians pose(even after the Berlin Wall came down).It'd probably be helpful to have at least a bit of background on these types of things before reading this one.Nothing incredibly great, but its still a nice read. Fairly informative and a nice glimpse of Chomsky's views(not like they're a secret)."
3,"Fine performance, lousy opera","Wow -- and they say ""Puritani"" has a bad libretto. At least that has a story. All the characters do is stand around moaning about how they're suffering from love, except for punctuations of warmongering from the chorus. The orchestrations are delightful and the music entertaining, though most of the tunes are of the vapid variety that Verdi used for his party scenes. And the coloratura usually has no dramatic reason; Elena even tries to calm James with music of extreme agitation. But then, Rossini here makes little effort to link musical tone with drama; example, James's haughty denunciation of Malcolm is done in the exact same music as the following reconciliation. As to the performance, my one complaint is that the romantic leads (soprano and mezzo) sound too much alike, as do her two other suitors (both tenors). Coloratura is delivered softly yet mostly quite well. And Valentini Terrani is really wonderful (Ricciarelli pretty good too!)."
2,This set is too expensive !,"Of course Fischer-Dieskau is a great performer. This is not the problem herewith.Fortunately, you can find a lot of CDs of Fischer-Dieskau on the net about 10$ each with far more choice of masterworks.Good purchases."
1,This is a bad cd,It is not worth the money on the site it does not represent the great music of the sixties do not buy
3,Crossword dictionary,"This isn't the best dictionary for crossword puzzles; not enough words that are typically used in crossword puzzles. I had a much better one years ago, but cannot remember who published it."
3,Seems to do the trick....,Physically it's so thick that it's a bit hard to handle-- won't stay open etc-- but usually helps. Not as functional as some of the online solving sites.
3,Crossword Puzzle solver aids,"I received this book on time and in perfect condition. It's an OK book, but at the same time I bought THE MILLION WORD CROSSWORD DICTIONARY,which has proven itself to be absolutely unbeatable insofar as helping solve crossword puzzles."
3,A MODESTLY GOOD CROSSWORD DICTIONARY,"I NEEDED A NEW CROSSWORD DICTIONARY & WANTED ONE CHEAP.THAT'S WHAT I GOT. ITS THICKNESS MEANS THAT THERE ARE MANY ENTRIES (ABOUT WHICH IN A MOMENT), BUT THE BINDING IS VERY TIGHT (TO KEEP THE PAGES FROM FALLING OUT), AND THE MARGINS ARE VERY NARROW. CONSEQUENTLY I HAVE MUCH TROUBLE READING THE LINES NEAR THE INNER MARGIN.AS FOR CONTENT: YES, THERE ARE TONS OF ENTRIES BUT TO MY AMAZEMENT SOME WORDS I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED TO BE THERE ARE NOT. (I DON'T RECALL WHICH. IN FAIRNESS, THIS IS NO UNCOMMON FAILING IN CHEAPER BOOKS.) ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE ARE A GREAT MANY ENTRIES. BUT DETAILS AND DEFINITIONS SEEM OFTEN SOMEWHAT, EVEN VERY, SKIMPY."
4,Does the Job!,"We do the NY Times puxxle each day and have found this book is a useful tool. No one book is going to have all the answers; you can always wait for the published answer to the crossword is that is so important! Our main complaint is that the book fell apart in 18 months. The larger print and whiter paper makes it easier to read AND to add notes/words to. Would definitely NOT recommend the ""Trade Paperback"" for these durability and readability issues. We did order recently copies of other dictionaries for comparison but found this to be the best for general use."
2,Not very helpful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This dictionary has certainly not proven to be helpful to me. It isn't even a good dictionary. It has so few entries--none of which answered my questions about the clues I was seeking answers to.
3,Mirriam- Webster Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,This book is not as good as Andrew Swanfeldt's Dictionary. The only reason I ordered this book was that its copywrite was a later date than the other and I thought it might be more updated. Not So!
3,Not what I expected,"I expected this to contain or help solve phrases, not just act as a dictionary for words. I only use it as a backup to the A-Z dictionary which in my opinion is far superior."
3,"Helpful, not great","My husband & I have discovered a newfound love for crossword puzzles and, well, needed some help. This dictionary was about 40-50% helpful when we absolutely had to ""cheat"". We did find a lot of other useful trivia that we learned while looking for answers. Not bad, not the best. Just average and okay. Price was about what it was worth."
5,The Best Children's Album EVER!,"I also can't believe that this is still available. I can't believe I still remember so many words, but I think I listened to this album about 2000 times as a child. I'm certainly going to make sure I get it for my newborn child for her to enjoy too!"
2,"Good Product, Not Quality Product","Shipping was prompt. Bought 9/11, received 9/17. These gloves are a useful addition to anyone's collection.. when they work. As of 11/1, the inside stitching has come undone(no longer waterproof) and the 'low' setting on this pair of gloves has stopped working. I contacted the seller, Healthy and Active, and they stuck to their warranty policy that only offers a 30 day warranty/return period despite the defect in these gloves. DO NOT BUY if you want a durable, quality product that will last you more than 30 days."
4,Great product that could be a lot better,These gloves are awesome as a novelty massage item but they do have some quite serious flaws in design.While the vibration motors are very powerful they are positioned right on the tips of your fingers so after a few minutes your fingers go numb and with the motors in this position it feeling what you are massaging impossible much less knowing how much pressure you are applying. The battery pack position also causes problems when putting on or taking off the gloves.
4,Some great points and some so so points,"I have owned two pairs of these gloves. The first set worked awesome, but due to overusage we had to bury them. The second pair, died a watery death as the claim of being waterproof is not always true. That being said, we have friends that own a paid and they have had no problems with water (including in their hot tub). I would agree with the other comments that the gloves tend to fit snugly, so if you have larger than average gloves you will most likely bust a seam or two getting in and out of them. All in all well worth the money and I am ordering my third set today."
4,gloves,Works great although the right one the thumb did work when it came in and its not as powerful as the left. Otherwise its a great item
5,great gloves,I liked the pair of gloves. it works great. only problem I have had is that the small fingr pad keeps turning out to the top side of the glove on both gloves.
3,"Cool, but kind of a novelty","These are gloves are a lot of fun for massages, but you can't practically wear them for longer than a few minutes without your fingers becoming totally numb from the vibrations. The battery pack location also should be on the back of the gloves-- not on the inside of the wrists. Still, the gloves are a lot of fun and work as advertised."
4,does the job well,"at first glance the juicer seems very light and flimsy (which is what i would expect from B&D;). Although it's small size is a plus for kitchen counters which are filled with so many appliances these days. But it worked beautifully. It got every bit of the juice and pulp (i like a lot of pulp so i haven't tested it with little or no pulp) and strained it automatically and effortlessly. I used to use a one of those chintzy plastic hand strainers that would clog half way through an orange, requiring further straining by hand. But this one kept pushing everything through to the pitcher.If you squeeze one or two glasses of juice a day at the price i highly recommend this. If you need to juice large amounts daily as others have mentioned this would probably give you hand fatigue and you would need a professional model costing much more. I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 because of it's light construction and so not being sure how long it will last. But for under $20 it does the job well."
5,Great Product,"I must say, I am quite happy with this thing. It works really good. I have bought this juicer for few weeks now, and have been using it since, No complaints so far."
2,"Good, but very noisy","Black & Decker is a good Juicer, it is easily to clean was was inexpensive, but the noise early in the morning is so loud it makes my ears ring for several hours. To validate the sound level, I used my iPod, a product that was forced to be regulated due to the noise, and set it to the controlled 80 DB and then juiced a dozen oranges. The results was the inability to hear the iPod during the juicing process. Hay Black & Decker, show some US innovation and lower the noise on this device!Note, after reading the remainder of the recommendations on this product, I happened upon a statement that the product was not noise. Black & Decker, was this a 'paid for posting' to support your product?"
2,Melted in the dishwasher,"The juicer worked great, but then the plastic warped in the dishwasher and the juicer didn't work anymore. Apparently it is not dishwasher safe."
5,Perfect for the Master Cleanse/Lemonade Diet,"Love this juicer! I used it at least 6 times/day for 21 days in a row while doing the master cleanse, it worked flawlessly. If you are thinking of buying a citrus juicer, this is the one for you! I also have a much pricier Bodum citrus juicer that is a pain to use and clean, I wish I bought this one first."
5,Fast and Easy Juicer,"For those who want a fast and easy juicer for their fresh grapefruit or orange juice, the Black and Decker CitrusMate Plus fits the bill. It is easy to use and clean and not heavy or bulky for counter use."
5,it makes juice...,"This is a good product for the price. I've juiced everything from small blood oranges to grapefruits with it. The only complaint that I have is that it's supposed to reverse the direction of rotation on every cycle, but this feature is ""erratic"" at best. It rotates clockwise probably 85% of the time. Other than that, it's a good product that I would definitely recommend."
1,Please don't buy this juicer,"This is my second juicer from B&D. Both stopped working for the same reasons and within a short time. I think when you juice a large quantity of fruit, it just gives out. I think the positive ratings are coming from people who JUST received their juicer. They don't know that it will stop working in a few days or weeks yet. Please don't buy this product."
5,CJ525 Citrus Mate Juicer,"Great product! Very strong motor, which reverses itself every couple of spins to get every last ounce of juice! The variable pulp switch lets you choose how much pulp you want in your juice!"
2,Great -- while it worked...,"Moving to Texas, we were all excited at the prospect of citrus season, a time when 10 lbs. or oranges costs $1.99.This juicer, while temporarily adequate, didn't quite live up to our expectations. Juicing tended to take much longer than it should have when more than a little bit of pressure would stop and reverse the juicing mechanism. Granted, this was a minor annoyance.However, it's less than a year down the road, with only about 10 juicing sessions to its name. The juicer has died. Any pressure at all stops the motor dead.We're currently looking for a new model."
5,Great Jucier,This orange Juicier is really good and easy to have fresh squeezed orange juice. I recommend this product.
3,Citrus juicer,It is becoming increasing difficult to find a good citrus juicer which catches the juice in a container rather than spitting it out to a disconnected container (too easy to spill in the latter case). I have used this juicer before and did not like all of the parts one has to clean after use--five!! But this one seems better constructed and the strainer pieces do not disconnect every use (at least not yet) so it is easier to reassemble after use.
4,well thought out,"At first, by the look and feel, I thought it was 'cheap'. But after using it I realized how well thought out the design is. It has a lot of features that help with storage, easy to take apart to clean and even easy to put back together. Only thing that isn't my ideal is the 'no pulp' setting, still lets pulp through. So if you want no pulp whatsoever, you will have to strain it with a normal strainer."
1,"Too noisy, too many parts to clean","I just bought this to replace my faithful Oster which finally quit. This is too noisy, and there are too many parts to clean - lemon inside the orange reamer, and 2 screens and the container. My old Oster had 2 pieces - the screen attached to the reamer, and the juice container to wash. That was it. Also curious about the need for the automatic reverse. Just something else to go wrong."
2,"Starts strong, wears out fast","We purchased this juicer three years ago and the motor is powerful and good for the price, but the motor mechanism is finicky (doesn't always start promptly when you press down) and the plastic gears ground themselves up in three years. It was good in the meantime for juicing limes and oranges (two different juicing attachments) but cheap plastic gears inside sealed its fate in the end.I'd repair it, but there is no customer support for internal components out of warranty, and it is not serviced by Black & Decker but by a third party kitchen company that also does George Foreman products and breadmakers. In the meantime, I'm hunting for a 1 cent, 40 tooth to 8 tooth reducing gear that ground itself down to 40 teeth to 1 tooth.Good design, cheap plastic gears, Black and Decker in decoration only."
5,It works...........,Finally....a contraption that finally does what it says it will do. How refreshing.This little jewel DOES THE JOB. It's quick and easy and key parts come apart so cleaning is a snap. If it breaks down after a few months...big deal...buy another one at under $20. How can you go wrong?Go for it.....
2,Disappointing,"I have had many high-end centrifugal and gear juicers which require throwing in the entire fruit so I wanted something that would be quick and easy to clean. This is neither.With the Black and Decker name I thought it would be a quality item. It isn't. It takes a long time to juice a grapefruit - or an orange, and it doesn't do a very good a job leaving pulp in the skin. Too much pressure stops the motor, not enough and it doesn't turn. The automatic reversal seldom works. Cleaning all the pulp from the strainer is near impossible. Cheaply made - the handle on the plastic container broke with hardly any pressure.If you are really interested in a citrus juicer, read all Amazon reviews (don't just read the good reviews), go for one that will cost you more but do the job better."
1,RIGHT- LEFT- WRONG!,"I have had this juicer for about 6 months. I cannot imagine why there are ANY good reviews of this piece of junk! I live in CA, I have citrus trees and I've owned at least 4 juicers over the years. You plop an orange on this thing and it spins one direction, then immediately changes direction, then changes direction again!. And I mean IMMEDIATELY. The thingy spins about 2 mm's then reverses, so it leaves the orange well vibrated and not juiced. No matter how delicate I am with it, it reverses constantly and siezes up. Forget pushing on it.. I can't even hold the orange on it and it does this. I'm going to toss it. It's too agravating. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"
5,Citrus Plus Juicet The Best!!!,"We love this item works like a more expensive model, the price and the performance was a winner."
4,wonderfully easy to use,"most other juicers will tire out your wrists long before you have enough juice for a cup, but not this one. using it couldn't be easier- cut the oranges in half, hold one half over the top, and it spins around, and your juice ends up in the little pitcher on the bottom. when you have enough (it has handy markings on the sides of the pitcher for measuring), twist off the pitcher & pour it out.because the motor is in the seperate base that doesn't get any juice on it, washing it is super easy- just pop off the juicer piece, the pulp straining top, and the pitcher and wash them in your dishwasher or sink."
3,Feeble,"A nice toy but when you try to make orange or grapefruit juice and push down a little, the engine seizes and stops. You have to be very gentle using this underpowered machine. A little more pressure and it just stops in your hands. I am off to look for something with a bit more power. Nice design but weak delivery!"
1,Fantastic except it doesn't last,"My partner and I juice oranges and small red gratefruit daily for breakfast, and this juicer works great for about 2-3 weeks, until which time the motor either burns up or the plastic gears strip out. We've had 6 of these, and the last one just stripped out this morning. Black and Decker outlet stores are very nice about replacing them, but I'm tired of it, so I came on line to search for better products today, which is what prompted this review. Too bad, because if it was constructed a little better, it would be a great compact juicer. Cheers, Gary"
1,Can't recommend this Juicer,"Had an Oster for over 20 yrs and it gave out. Replaced it with this B&D product after reading the great reviews. Motor is very underpowered, quits and just stops working with very little pressure. Have only had it for 6 wks. Can't even get through a single soft juicy orange. Giving up on it, looking for something else. Wonder why some many good reviews? An occasional review reporting similar findings as me--maybe quality control?"
1,"Underpowered motor, poor engineering","I have already returned the juicer. First thing I noticed when I made my first cup of juice was how weak the motor is. I had to very gingerly apply force to the orange in order to keep the motor turning. It's also a very loud operation with the motor sound and plastic parts all rattling. The biggest issue, however, was with the internal gears being stripped in the clockwise spin direction. The juicer randomly decides which direction to spin when you press down on it so I had to repeatedly tap the orange on the juicer until it spun in the good direction.Spend some more money and buy a juicer that actually works..."
1,Juice container melted and deformed in dish washer,I purchased the juicer over 6 months ago. One day I put it in the dishwasher and the palstic contaner melted and deformed such that it cannot be assemebled back together. I contacted the company and they told me without receipt I am SOL and they are not going to replace the container. I would stay away from this product or a vendor who does not stay behind its defective designs.
1,Buyer beware!,"1) The large juicer attachment falls off every time I juice a big grapefruit because it doesn't 'snap' on top of the small juice head. Additionally, the 'large' attachment isn't that large so it can really only handle fruits no bigger than an orange.2) It's harder to clean than my last juicer (Krup) because it has twice as many parts to clean.3) The motor jams 50% of the time when juicing large fruits like grapefruits and oranges."
5,Works like a charm!,"It's a joy to be able to have fresh juice easily. I was pleasantly surprised to see that what had been written about this inexpensive juicer was true. Easy to use, does a good job and cleanup was easy."
4,Love fresh Orange Juice,"And this product works great. The only thing keeping this from rating a 5 is clean-up. And that is more to do with the features/design than a product flaw.The best time to clean-up is immediately after the juicing operation. Everything comes apart for easy cleaning - shouldn't take more than a minute or so.However, if you wait until later to clean-up, the pulp will dry out and cling to the surfaces of the strainer, adding to the clean-up time.I've had this item for nearly 2 years and use it nearly every day. For the price and value received you can't go wrong. I would buy again."
2,Not much easier than juicing by hand,"It takes up a lot of space and is pretty hard to clean and yet it's not much different than juicing by hand - you still have to hold the orange down, you just don't have to turn it. It doesn't get any more juice out either, maybe even less. I can't quite see why everyone loves it so much."
5,What a joy!,"I always took pride in the fact that I hand squeezed lemons for fresh lemonade. Unfortunately I have severe arthritis and carpal tunnel so fresh lemon or orange juice were a rare treat in my house. On a lark I looked for an easier way to get juice from a lemon and I happened upon the Black & Decker citrus juicer. The price was right and even though, in the back of my mind I was sure it would be a ""bust, I thought I'd give it a try. WHAT A JOY!!! The day it arrived, I squeezed a dozen lemons in a fraction of the time it used to take AND I got twice as much juice with almost no pain. I plan on picking up a couple of dozen oranges as soon as I can to treat my family to fresh orange juice. The juicer is easy to use and easy to clean. All in all I think this product is fantastic!"
5,CitrusMate Plus,"For the price, this juicer works better than I expected. I am very pleased with how well it extracts the juice from the fruit and makes an easy job of it. I love to make lemonade and hate to use a manual juicer. This appliance is great!"
1,Product Never Worked,"I bought this juicer based on reviews I read here. The motor never engaged for me. In addition, when I was ""fiddling"" with it trying to get it to work, I used too much force and cracked the plastic juice receptacle. So...I am reluctant to send it back."
1,Citrusmate-poorly made,"Product did not work upon arrival, motor dead, 2 little plastic tabs on each side are the only thing that hold the juice container on the motor base, one was cracked right out of the box. They are not stout enough to last very long, can not be replaced. Pulp selector good idea, product just to wimpy for even light everyday use, would not buy again, better off with hand juicer or look at better quality product."
3,Not the best juicer,"I am a bit disappointed in this juicer. I bought it to make homemade OJ and for lime and lemon juice. Despite having three settings to adjust the amount of pulp that you desire, this juicer leaves a lot of pulp in your juice even when you do not want it. The setting to have no pulp doesn't work very well. If you don't like pulp this isn't the juicer for you."
4,Recommended,"Great juicer. Easy to use and to clean. I gave it 4 stars not 5 because when you are done extracting the juice there is no lid for the juicer...Otherwise, great product and price too!"
2,What a shame...,This juicer looked good sounded good and the price was goood!What a cheap piece of junk. Black and Decker has always disappointed me and this wasn't an exception. The thing jumps all over the counter in spite of rubber on the bottom. The filter that collects the membranes clogs up continuously and is impossble to get clean. When I attempted to juice a grapefriut the machine just couln't handle it! Pay the postage and you can have it!
1,Possibly the worst appliance I've ever purchased.,"Used this once; I'll be returning it. It took about 10 minutes to make a pint of orange juice. Very noisy, stopped every time I put even adequate pressure on the fruit. Cheaply made all-plastic. I can't believe Black and Decker would put their name on this."
3,Juicer,"We juice oranges from 2 trees every year, and this isn't the quality juicer that we had had for almost 39 years! But they don't make them like they used to. Our old one was metal, and very sturdy, this one is plasic, and I doubt will last as long. It did the trick, but I would still prefer something a little heavier."
2,Acceptable for small job,"Although the design is very good, this juicer does not have enough power. It just stops and cannot handle very much pressure. However, we really like controlling the amount of pulp in the juice."
4,Love it.,"It's so much easier to use this juicer than to juice by hand. I can juice a whole bag of oranges in just a few minutes. It has large and small cones for large and small oranges. The strainer can adjust to make the juice pulpy or pulp-free. My kids like the juice pulp-free and this juicer does the job. (It's still thick, but the kids don't notice.)Just cut the oranges and press them on the juicer. The juicer gets it all out in seconds. I don't have to press too hard; it has plenty of power to do the job.Everything goes in the dishwasher when I'm done (except for the motor, of course). It's so easy to clean. Glad I got this."
1,very flawed,I have had this for a month and i usually juice 4-5 oranges everyday. This juicer has gotten me nuts because it keeps turning on itself while juicing. And it makes strange noises now. I'm throwing it away
1,Don't waste your time and money,"I bought this model because I had given my old juicer to my daughter, which is basically the same design and never had any problems. I had 16 grapefruit to get through and I started on the first half of the first grapefruit and it stopped working. I let it sit a minute and tried again, just pushing on the column to see if it would work. It worked for just a little bit more and then it didn't work again. Piece of garbage.Black & Decker CJ525 CitrusMate Plus Citrus Juicer"
4,great juicer hard to clean,The citrus pulp gets stuck in between the mesh which consists of two layers which determine how much pulp is desired. Perfect otherwise!
5,"Highly recommended; works great, easy to clean","A perfect product; works well with lemons, limes, oranges, grapefruits and it is SO easy to clean. Since citrus juice is a natural cleaner, I just remove it from the base and rinse everything. If it has been sitting too long, then it washes easily with sudsy water. I don't think it is fair to rate it 2 stars because you put it in the dishwasher and it warped. We have used this juicer for years and it has always been a good, sturdy product.We initially got it to ward off the flu because a great grandfather was cured of the flu during the 1917-1918 flu pandemic by being taken from the hospital and fed hot lemonade for weeks. Everyone else in the hospital died. Now I just love to drink fresh squeezed lemonade with a tiny bit of stevia for sweetener. Goes with my low carb diet, helps me drink more water, and just makes me feel good."
4,citrus juicer,this juicer replaced a juicer I previously used for many years--the best part is the pitcher where the juice goes--for storing and pouring-great value for the price--I tried a $30 juicer by Cuisinart and you had to put a glass under the spout and the juicer had no stability so it twirled as you juiced. WHAT A MESS!!! returned after one use--Went online to find the Black and Decker and was thrilled to see they still made a similar one to the one I had!!
4,Great juicer,"Very easy to use. This item is lightweight yet sturdy enough that there is no slippage during the juicing process. Apply pressure and the juicer starts to spin; Release pressure and reapply, the spinner reverses to maximize the juicing. Three pulp settings, volume markings on the collection container, easy to clean and the cord wraps around the base for easy storage. Great product for the price!"
2,"Worked ok, while it lasted","I had this juicer for 4 years, using it *maybe* a couple dozen times each year (i.e. a couple of times a month - if that). I'm not sure the cost justifies it breaking after that amount of usage and will not purchase another of this brand. As others mentioned, it is noisy, and it is lightweight (in this case lightweight seemed to equal poor quality). I'm on the hunt for a more substantial juicer now. :)"
2,"Poor design, no lasting value, waste of money.","It lasted me a month juicing 7 days a week. It started turning back and forth by itself at random times and I could hear the gears inside grinding against each other in a bad way. I gave up on it and opened it since I was not going to return it and my general impression is of cheap materials and design. The plastic gears look like they would wear themselves off very quick. The exterior design of the juicer is good and functional (juice holder, pulp selector, easy cleaning, power cord wrapping, etc) but I think the internals are not. Maybe they can't make them good at the 20-30 dollars range. Maybe it was just a defective model but I cannot recommend it."
2,"impossible to clean, stalls",The strainer is so constituted that it cannot be taken apart. All sorts of pulp hangs up in there and is almost impossible to scrub out.The motor stalls constantly.
4,"I agree with 'If it lasts, it will be near-perfect'","I agree with an earlier reviewer: 'If it lasts, it will be near-perfect'.Mine lasted about 6 years (using it about 20 times/year) to make orange juice for weekend breakfasts when oranges are in season. Now the gearing is worn out and I am looking to buy a replacement.Functionality:..... 5 stars (makes OJ with ease)Ease of Cleaning: 5 stars (just rinse while pulb is still wet in the strainer)Longevity:......... 2 stars (while I got my money's worth - this juicer is cheap -, I hate having to throw an entire appliance away when only a part is broken; I prefer longevity over cheap initial cost. B&D;, charge more money and make it last longer!)."
4,Very Good product,Finally after years of juicing by hand I bought this juicer to help with the mountain of oranges we get from the trees in our backyard. Juicer worked as advertised and the clean-up of both parts and kitchen was smooth and effortless.
3,Good value,Decent juicer for the money. The auto reverse function is a little finicky and will sometimes reverse when you don't expect it or doesn't reverse when you want it to. But it juices much faster than a manual one and easy to clean. I like the adjustable strainer and juicer cone sizes. Overall good value.
3,Great while it works,"As many other reviewers, I loved this citrus juicer when I first got it 3 years ago. It is perfect in every way. One of the best features is the pulp catcher, which allows you to control how much pulp goes into the juice.After using a hand-held press for lemons and limes, I recently tried using this item but found out that it had stopped working properly. The good torque it used to generate had disappeared. It still worked but would stop at the slightest amount of pressure, thus becoming useless."
5,Truly brilliant and heartfelt piece of work! . . .,"While this lovely novel is aimed at the mother/daughter market, it's truly a gem for anybody who has ever navigated the labyrinth of difficult teen years, particularly when ""fitting in"" or ""flying under the radar"" is no longer a viable option. A truly wonderful and heartfelt novel! I highly recommend!"
3,OK but not perfect,I bought this as a gift for my sister in Arizona and she has reported that it leaks a little around the spigot. Sort of problematic then when placed in the refrigerator to chill.
2,Ball Sunflowers Jar,"The product itself is fine; the shipping leaves little to be desired. I was surprised that five arrived safely, one broke due to poor packing. The jars were not bubble-wrapped, nor was the shipping box substantial enough to withstand abuse. What was the S & H fee paid for? I have not received a response for a refund on one broken jar from ACE."
1,Poor chinese quality,"The jar is fine although a bit heavy. The spigot is the problem. No matter what I did to that spigot, I could not get it to stop dripping. I finally gave up and used the lid on the old sun tea jar that was missing its lit. The spigot on it looks like a similar design and it does not leak."
4,very nice,"I think I was looking at the wrong season for these because I couldn't find a single one, except here. But this one works great and it's nice to have ice tea in the house whenever I want."
3,Not working as I had hoped,"The seal around the spigot was not attached.....they say in the literature never to remove the seal. I used super glue....it still leaked....then I waxed the seal....it still leaked. I finally got the seal to work. When I put the jar into the refrigerator (with the spigot just off the edge of the shelf so I could draw my tea from the spigot) the door would not close because of the spigot. So now, I pour my tea from the top of the jar....a big pain!"
1,Spend a few more dollars on something better,"Not that attractive up close, very flimsy top that feels like it would break if you used the handle to pick it up when full. Also after a number of uses the tap continued to leak severely! I finally got tired of wiping up tea leakage in my fridge and threw it away."
3,Great for tea until the spout leaks,"I bought this to make Kombucha tea, so far it has worked out great. It does not leak and the spout on the front makes for filling the bottles with tea a breeze.Update:After about 6 months the spout did start to leak."
2,Not the same quality anymore,"Spigot leaks if not seated exactly right. Lid is pretty lightweight, much cheaper plastic than years ago. Does the job, but grrrr."
2,Leaks,Spigot leaked several times in Fridge when first got. Use for outside only and put tea in other container when in Fridge.
2,Unfortunate online purchase,"I bought this product for a friends birthday gift... looked great, just what the friend wanted! Filled it up, set it in the sun to brew, set it in the fridge to chill, leaked like a sieve at the spigot seal area. Messed up the entire refridgerator. Sadly, it's one of those lower cost items you don't feel like boxing, sending back. I'm trying to fix it for my friend. Total cost was around 15 bucks so, it was a little pricey for a jar and then to have it leak.... totally unfortunate."
2,Office 2001 for the Mac - Too Buggy,"Office 2001 shouldn't have been released - it crashes the computer, and has so many features I'll never use. But - there's some good functionality there - such as the integration between Outlook and Word."
1,why can't it be great?,"Okay, so they're a monopoly. So why not take advantage of that market power and make a great product instead of a lousy one?Powerpoint is reactive. It just tweaks a very mediocre tool instead of making it intuitive and powerful.Excel abandons so many of the little things you're already used to. Command D no longer fills down. Command T no longer converts relative to absolute. Sigh.And word is more of the same, with that stupid little paper clip guy.I'm afraid to upgrade to entourage... maybe someday. The short version: if you're hoping that this round of upgrades will dramatically increase your productivity, you will be sorely disappointed..."
3,incremental improvements,"Essentially an incremental update of Office, with some cosmetic improvements and a useful new automatic floating palette function. It's good that Microsoft has stopped simply porting the Windows version of Office to the Mac; however, if you are happy with Mac Office 98, you should look at the ""new"" features carefully to ensure upgrading is worth the hassle and the cost. Beware of the included Value Pack as well, it will slap several hundred Mb of flashy clip art and bloated document templates on your hard drive if you aren't careful."
1,Overpriced & Crash-prone,"I am surprised by the number of positive reviews for this version of Office. I have used Office 98 for 3 years, which had it's problems but was OK. This version doesn't provide many new features & certainly isn't worth the price upgrade. Moreover, the only new feature, Entourage, crashes your computer (if you are running OS 9) & simply doesn't work. Trying to hotsync w/ your Palm is not an easy matter if you can get it to work. Moreover, Microsoft still loads a bunch of extensions into your system folder which conflict with other Microsoft software, especially Outlook Explorer & Internet Express. It's been a nightmare just trying to things to work properly. I have tried all the fixes posted on troubleshooting sites, but still have yet to get Entourage to evenopen. To add insult to injury the Upgrade price is even more than I paid to buy the full Office '98 package w/ extras."
4,Wonderful!,"Energy, talent and a tuba. I think those three words best describe the nerd-rockers of Snmnmnm.Pass this down to all your friends! Amazon has a great description of the album, better than whatever I could babble on about...but I will babble, nonetheless.Not many digital tricks, pure indie goodness, crunchy guitar riffs, Beach Boys style harmonizing (as Amazon has aforesaid) this is just a very overlooked album. Give it to your local College Radio station! They'll eat it up!The only thing that gets stuck in my craw is the lack-luster ""Another Song Ray Hates"" I think I understand the premise, but it's just soooooo bland.Otherwise, great album, awesome band, cool tuba. (ELECTRIC tuba. I saw that guy live, he had an amazing 5-minute solo in ""Spanish Cucumber, jeeze he's got one set of lungs.)"
1,worst jukebox I have brought,"1) Battery does not work (can't be charged), Therefore, it is useless for portable device2) Can't play song or other mp3 files in subdiretory3) too big"
1,Planned obsolescence,"The battery life is infamously lame which is bad enough. But once the battery will no longer take a charge, you own a paper weight. Since Polaroid did not make these they dont make the replacement batteries. The company that did make them is out of business and the batteries have some sort of circuit board attached so that you cant buy a generic replacement. In short you are buying a player that will only last as long as the battery will take a charge. For me I got about 4 months of use. AVOID!"
1,Big Attitude Bad Product,Worst deodorant I have ever used. smells bad and does NOT stop persperation to any degree!
3,Fun book but....,"... I wasn't expecting this book to be so small. It's the size of a papberback, I was expecting the usual big, glossy, hardcover. And I would have liked it to have more color pictures. Quite a few of the pictures are illustrations and black and white. But, I purchased a second-hand version so it wasn't too bad."
3,Book was a hit but Amazon customer service was not!,"This was purchased along with other Ripley books as a Christmas gift for my nephew, age 11. They kept him entertained the entire day of our family gathering. My sister reports that he is constantly relaying information and showing her pictures that he found interesting. The books arrived promptly but included two extra copies of each one ordered. It was painful and frustrating to deal with Amazon customer service and when a return label was finally sent to me it noted that Amazon was not at fault therefore I would be responsible for the return shipping expense. After contact number 5, this got settled and I am still awaiting the credit to show on my account. I am glad that I waited a few days before posting and cooled off before posting or I fear it would have gotten a much lower rating based on the trials of service alone."
5,Facsimile,"The book is certainly new; but it is important to note that, other than the introduction, it is a facsimile (although in very good condition). This is not mentioned in the Product Description above, which seems a strange omission.Since I have just opened the package, I have not yet had the leisure to read the ten-page introduction thoroughly; but it seems to include a very interesting historical overview as well as footnotes in case the reader wishes to do more in-depth research.The stories included are:1) Lady Kate, The Dashing Female Detective--First Half;2) Lady Kate, The Dashing Female Detective--Second Half;3) The Great Bond Robbery Tracked by a Female Detective; and4) Madge The Society Detective: A Strange Guest Among The Four Hundred."
4,Great Machine,I purchased this food processor after much deliberation and research. I got this one because of kitchenaids superior customer service and the fact that I have 3 sizes in one. I love the three different bowls and all the attachments. The case for the attachements is awesome.When I received it in the mail and opened it I realized that it didn't have the citrus press as stated so I called customer service and they sent me a new one no questions asked. I have always heard that their customer support was awesome and now I know that it is.I would recommend this to anyone who needs a big processor so of the time but not always.
5,Great kitchen staple,"My wife and I bought ours in 2005. Although I think ours is actually the 11 cup model. It's virtually the same unit. The only negative comment I have is the weight and size. But what do you expect for a large processor?My wife made dough for bread, it was ok for that. Eventually we'll get a stand mixer when we upgrade to a bigger kitchen. It's great for making cakes, bread, noodle or potato puddings, hummus, and genral processing needs for recipes.We did not play around with a lot with all the different blades.Anyway, we highly recommend it."
4,kitaid-toony,Very powerful and fast. Makes cookie dough very well. Very heavy and does not vibrate and move like my old processor. Do not use for liquids. Power makes top leak and overflow when doing liquids. I agree with some previous reviews that downgrade product for leaking. They should have some sort of seal to prevent spillage.
5,"Huge, but great","I replaced the 7 oz KitchenAid, which had a feed tube so small that even a small cucumber would go in it. I found the 7 oz fine for chopping, but not for slicing.I ordered this one because of the large feed tube plus round feed tube. This is for people who like to keep the food processor out on the counter, because it is so large and heavy that it would be difficult to put away. It comes with a small bowl, which is not extremely efficient, and a medium bowl which I would use more if it didn't seem to also make the big bowl dirty and in need of washing.Basically, I'm satisfied with this food processor and use it every day, and NEVER put it away!"
4,"Great Product, a real Work Horse","I have been using the 12 cup model for a year now...my first food processor and I love it. I am on a raw food diet, so I use this food processor at least once or twice a day. I have the clear/white handled model. I have come to see that food residue is going into the clear handle and I can't seem to rinse it out even with baking soda and vinegar. I would like to be able to take it apart to clean inside, but feel that I may damage the appliance by taking it apart and see no clear way to take handle apart. I find I mostly use the big bowl with the S-blade and also the grating and slicing blades. Never use the small or intermediate bowls at all....it's is just easier to clean out the big bowl and start over. All in all I am very happy with my purchase."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this model over a Cuisinart due to positive reviews here and elsewhere. Problems however began right out of the box.The machine uses a complicated safety mechanism of levers housed within the handle of the work bowl and the work bowl cover. These levers are not lubricated and sealed so when new I couldn't assemble the cover to the bowl or the bowl to the motor due to the stickiness of the plastic. After I washed these parts they reluctantly slid together, the water acting as a lubricant. A few months later the handle of the bowl cracked and was replaced under warranty. Now a month after the 1 year warranty the cover is cracked and must be replaced as well at a cost of $30. These cracks are due to the design and operation of the safety mechanism so I am sure these parts will continue to break, costing me $60 a year. This is unacceptable, especially since I only use the machine every two weeks or so."
3,Great potential - poor realization,"My wife has been using the Braun food processor weekly for about 12 years. It still works, but some parts are showing wear, so we bought the KA on Cooks Illustrated's recommendation. The pulse button worked exactly one time. Assembly is non-intuitive. It lacks a speed control, which the Braun has. If we can find replacement parts for the Braun, we might return to it and shelve the Kitchen Aid.Further usage revealed further problems. Beware of processing liquids--eggs, for example. Even when the bowl is only one-quarter full, the material will rise during processing and leak out of the center tube of the bowl. With even more liquid in the bowl, liquid will leak under the lid and down the side of the bowl. These are not quality issues--they are DESIGN issues. Shame on Kitchen Aid. About 10 years ago I bought a Black & Decker food processor for $30. Though it is smaller and has fewer features, it still performs admirably."
2,Spill over!,"This food processor is advertised as accommodating 12 cups, and like other reviewers before me, I found this not to be true.If and when you use it for more than four cups of liquid, as I did, the liquid spills out via the short middle stem, an engineering blunder, and I had to wipe up everything: the container, the stand, the surrounding counter surface, in short: it was a mess!I opted to return it. No Problem, amazon.com took it back, and I will receive a refund. Instead, I searched for a replacement container for my old cracked Braun (4-cup)food processor. I found a left-over item at the other end of the United States--Braun, as another reviewer stated, does no longer service its food processors. Now I know that I can process four cups,four cups only but without spills! In addition, the Braun has a disk for fine grating which the rather more expensive Kitchen Aid lacks. I would have had to order it at additional expense. So, sorry! No Kitchen Aid for me!"
2,Not worth it,"Can't say much more than what has already been said... bought this because it was a KitchenAid and matched several of my other appliances.The good -1. It works-----------------The bad -1. Doesn't seal: get a tad too much in the bowl, especially if it's liquidy and watch it pour out the sides and all over the counter.2. Multiple bowls: sounds great at first - ""hey I can use the small bowl and not have to clean everything""... WRONG. Refer to number 1 above. Even grating something it leaks into the base bowl, creating two to clean.3. Multi-sized feed tube: again sounds like a great 'option' but it doesn't work well, creates another piece to clean, and is difficult to clean to get a brush into on top of that.Buy this if you enjoy cleaning extra dishes."
2,"Great, But Doesn't Last","Had this for 2-3 years and LOVED it. Sadly, the product is not built to last and I have 3 reasons for saying it:1) Parts which experience a lot wear are made of plastic, leading to failure. This shouldn't come as a shock to any engineer as plastic isn't designed to handle a lot of wear.2) The bowl handle cracked pretty quickly (no dropping, just from regular use) and eventually broke entirely.3) Even Kitchen Aid doesn't expect the product to last. New, the food processor cost is $200.00. Guess how much a 3 year extended warranty is? $216.62 (and that's even after a $38.23 savings).In short, if you are willing to buy one every 2-3 years for occasional use, then this product is for you. Personally, I am going to try something else..."
3,Only So-So... So Far,"this product works great for bread dough, but the main problem I have is that small pieces of food get everywhere in all of these nested bowls. In addition, the fact that you have to have the wide mouth food pusher in at least half way is cumbersome. I have to admit, though, this thing is a beast, and quiet to boot. This is my first food processor, so maybe I just need more experience with this type of tool? We'll see."
2,What a disappointment,"I got this food processor as a gift. I was so excited after watching all the cooking shows on tv making all these things with their processors.1st Use: making pie/pastry doughResult: The processor sent flour flying everywhere (yes, the lid was snapped securely into place!). I don't think my 6 year old could have made a bigger mess. Major clean-up required.2nd Use: chopping veggies for soupResult: Worked fine, lots of pieces and parts to clean3rd Use: juicing grapefruitResult: Whole lot of mess compared to the amount of juice I got. But the novelty of the citrus juicer was kinda fun.Cleanup after 3rd use --- noticed the entire handle of the bowl (the main part!) is disintegrating. I've been very careful (haven't bumped, dropped or anything like that). I can't believe it's already breaking!WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! I'm very disappointed in the poor quality of this product."
5,Does the job........,"My mom needed a new food processor because she burned up two of them making bread, so I decided to get her this one. It's a lot more powerful than her old ones. She loves the wide mouth opening and has made quite a few batches of bread and also a batch of pasta. She's had no problems mixing anything and really loves it. My little nephew loves the fact that Grandma makes him homemade rolls all the time. My mom says that she would recommend this machine to anyone. So far, so good!!!!"
4,beautiful machine,"very happy with the proformance of the processor.made the pizza recipe with it and the dough was done great.the pizza still needs to be worked on lol.all-in-all,fantastic product."
2,RIP dear processor,"I had this processor for a little over a year now and haven't used it much until recently. Some friends and I get together twice a month to cook. So, this little machine is used frequently and for large amounts. I loved how well it worked and how much simpler it made cooking large quantities. However, one week before Christmas, I shredded some cheese and the blade fused to the base. Noone can get the thing off, not even my brawny husband. After researching on the internet, it appears this is a common problem when using the shredding blade (weird). Since this is over a year old, Kitchenaid won't repair or exchange it. Sigh...now which processor do I get next???"
1,Would be nice if pieces didn't keep falling off.,"I love my KitchenAid mixer, and assumed a KitchenAid food processor would be of the same quality. I was wrong. I replaced my 20-year-old Cuisinart with one of these a few years ago. Almost immediately, the plastic bowl started developing stress cracks. Within a year, various small bits started breaking off, both on the bowl and on the processor base itself around the blade support. After two years, enough of the handle mechanism had failed that the processor would no longer turn on.I called KitchenAid, but since it was out of warranty, I was out of luck, even though this is clearly a product defect. While KitchenAid (a Whirlpool comany, BTW) considers 2 years a reasonable lifetime for something this expensive, I don't. I've gone back to Cuisinart, and couldn't be happier. I do still have my KitchenAid mixer, though!"
4,"quiet, powerful & easy to use","This processor is so easy to use, my 8 & 9 year olds were able to make a cheesecake following the recipe that came with it! It was delicious! It is very powerful and quiet compared to other processors I have. I enjoy the mini bowl insert. Great for making quick bowl of salsa or chopping up celery for potato salad."
3,No major problems,"I bought this to be able to cut up items quickly. I like the fact that it comes with a ton of attachments, but I've not had to use them all yet.I've used the shredding blade to shred sweet potatoes. It works, and is very fast, but leaves a good size chunk of the potato, uncut, laying flat between the blade and the cover of the food processor. Very annoying. With that said, it shreds the potato very quickly.The ""juicer"" attachment is rather flimsy, but works. I've tried it out with a stack of lemons, but it would work better with a larger fruit. Note: it is a citrus juicer only.I find the vertical shape nice as I have a smallish kitchen, but it limits capacity.If lost or stolen, I wouldn't immediately purchase this item again. It doesn't do anything that ""wows"" me and my (much cheaper) Ninja blender/chopper seems to work better for most of my chopping tasks."
2,"Messy, difficult to clean","I was very disappointed with this product. It is very messy and leaks all over the place, plus is really difficult to clean - so many nooks and crannies.... plus it does not process particularly well. Plus there is only one operational speed. It pointless having the smaller bowls for processing smaller quantities... you have to place them in the bigger bowl anyway, and then the whole lot gets messy so you have yet more parts to clean! The kitchen Aid hand blender is far superior..."
5,"Bought for my mother, she loves it.","Review title says it. Bought one for my mother on Mother's Day, she loves it. There were features not in normal food processors and she says it looks like it will last a long time."
1,Safety latch stopped working after about a year,"The safety latch stopped working after about a year (out of warranty - of course!), which renders the unit useless. I tried some home remedies, but they never really fixed the problem. Sadly, I'm throwing it away today and buying another brand. KitchenAid makes a great mixer, but this, not so much."
1,PIECE of JUNK !,"Junk, junk, junk.Thank heavens Amazon has such wonderful customer service.Myself as well as one of my friends purchased this so called food processor. We felt we researched it well BUT.......on the second use (shredding cheese) it fused together, forever.This seems to be a constant problem, which Kitchen Aid will not admit. They refused to take it back! Look at customer reviews on the KitchenAid website.We purchased Cuisinart, works great."
3,A Powerful Machine but Faulty Design,"I received this food processor in black over a year and half ago. Since I eat alot of raw food, this processor gets a workout! It does not disappoint as far as power and ease of use go. I can whip up anything from hummus to nut butters (which usually you can't make a really creamy nut butter in a food processor!). After almost daily use for this long, I would feel confident to recommend this product, if only it didn't have the following downfall: water and food particles have somehow found their way into the handle of the work bowl. You would think that if water and food can find their way IN to the handle, that they could be cleaned OUT of the handle. I however cannot clean it, and as a result, I have a years' worth of junk lodged in the handle of my work bowl. That's just unsanitary. I do plan to contact KitcheAid to see whether this is a common complaint on this model, or if perhaps I have a faulty machine."
5,Never going back,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant in every way! Used to have a Magimix and I am definitely never going back now that I have had the delight to have one of these. The juicer was a fabulous surprise and I use it every morning. Only negetive is that the funnel is tough to clean inside but a soft bottle brush seems to do the trick. Can't wait to have the chance to try out all the bits and pieces."
4,Yourgreat chopping assistant,"This is my first powerful food processor, and I'm really, really glad I got ""wide mouth"" version, because even with ""extra wide mouth"", you still have to cut vegetables smaller in pieces to fit into the feeding mouth. Strong motor to handle most anything you need to chop. Downside is that it requires so many parts to hand wash after completing single task. Attached smaller bowl only works inside the 12-cup bowl, and end up washing both, as it spills over to the bigger bowl in the edge."
5,It's purrrrfect!,"Couldn't help the title. This thing purrs like a kitten when it's running, so I couldn't resist. I've never owned a food processor before, and bought this one based on other reviews I'd read on amazon. I'm so happy with the choice I've made! I use it all the time, it's quick, quiet, easy to learn to use and clean-up is a snap, since everything is dishwasher safe! I know other folks have written about the safety feature on the lid and issues with liquids, but I've not run across any problems with these features... perhaps because I'm still a newbie at food processing. I couldn't be happier with this product and would highly recommend it to anyone!"
1,Very poor design,"From the beginning I had trouble with the lid fitting on the work bowl. Finally it completely broke. Also, you cannot put much food in the food tube or it will not work. I called Kitchenaid and was treated very poorly. I will not buy another kitchenaid food processor."
3,Fairly good,"The machine is fine, it is powerful and heavy and has a lot of attachments and they look to be of decent quality.One big omission is variable speed on the drive. There is just off, on and pulse which are all at the same speed. This is mostly pretty good but for chopping onions, for example you have to use very short bursts of the pulse or you end up with a mushy paste.The only time that this is really a problem is with juice extraction, which becomes something of a violent business and if you leave the cover open to press your oranges by hand, expect to get some specks of juice in your face.Having said that the machine has otherwise been very good, and if you don't want to do juice extraction it is great. For me, however, the lack of variable speed is such a big omission that I wish I had paid more for a machine that has it."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"After waiting 80 minutes for the installation of a program I was hoping to find to my liking for the work I do, I encountered nothing but error and illegal operation messages. After full install, it still required me to insert discs for some usage. I uninstalled the program only to find many problems with other programs on the computer. What a waste of time and money!"
1,Bad Software,"I bought this software because it looked like a good one for a reasonable cost. However, this program has problems after installing. I exchanged the software, believing that it had a bad disk after getting error and illegal operation messages. The new program did the same thing. A friend of mine bought the same program also and is having the same problems. We know it isn't our computer because hers is brand new and mine has a new hard drive installed. I do not recommend this product."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"During installation this program deleted important system files. I installed on a ""clean"" system and still ended up having to run scandisk and restore lost files. So, buyer beware!"
5,Excellent product!,"I almost didn't buy this product because of the reviews that had been written about it. But I did and I was very careful, cleaned up my hard drive and made sure I had the room, (I only had 6 gb of hard drive) and when I installed it I followed Microsoft's recommendations and instructions to the ""t"". I never run it with other programs open. It runs better that way. But you can do just about anything with this program. I was very impressed, and very glad I bought it!"
2,Microsoft Picture-IT Publisher Platinum,"My system came with Picture-It Express. An interesting applet but as all Microsoft -Express apps it had only a fraction of the functionality of it's pay-for-it cousin. For retouching digital photos it is awesome! For publishing to personal web site...it..well it's not so good at all. It took me several tries to upload the webpages and once it was uploaded the website was cast in stone. There is no facility in this product to edit or update a website once it's uploaded. Further, it has the same myopic Microsoft upper/lower case problems, it defines sever html files as lower case but makes them uppercase. NT would not care whereas a unix webserver DOES."
2,Microsoft Picture IT,"After buying my new Sony Mavica 1000, this was the first piece of software I used. It comes on 7 disks, but only two are actually installed-the rest have hundreds of sketches and pictures that look like they are drawn by the same person and are useless. When trying to print more than one picture on a page, I first get a message I am running out of memory and then the computer crashes. My computer guy here at work says there is nothing wrong with my memory; it is a problem with the program set up. Why would Microsoft sell a program that will not run properly. I do like what I can do with a photo, but am looking for new photo software until someone can figure out why my computer keeps crashing while using this program. I am unhappy with the software that came from Sony with my camera."
1,Bloatware at its worst!,"Eats up 1 gig of hard drive, most of the clipart just endlessly repeats the same tired themes (how may sketches of anonymous 17th century aristocrats can you possibly need?), and there are more video clips and other multi-media frills than any other package I've ever seen (and I've seen several). Excessive and self-indulgent."
1,I wish I had read these reviews before I bought.,"I too am very upset with the bad software from microsoft. I can't even load the program. It claims to be Windows 2000 compatible. When attempting to install I get an error message telling me I have -2048MB of memory and 32MB is the minimum. In fact, I have 2048MB or 2GB of memory. Again a stupid assumption on the part of microsoft that nobody would ever have that much memory. With a minus memory amount the program will not load. After reading the reviews I guess I should be happy, but like most I am out of pocket for the cost."
2,It`s not so BAD,"Got this program with my new P.C. AND I HATE IT! BUT I love it too. When it`s good, it`s very, very good. But when it`s bad....IT STINKS. If you remember to KEEP saving your work EVERY few minutes. Then WHEN (not if) it crashes. You can just plod on. AND if you allow yourself a couple of extra hours to finish your project, it will be kool! REMEMBER this program cost aroung [] in the U.K. That`s not too bad. Stick with it, treat it nice. take your time, stay kool. Everything will work out O.K. in the end. Trust me.....I`m a professional!"
3,"Well-done, but demanding ...","If you are a sim purist, history buff or a pilot, you will love this one. Those of us who prefer a good blend of playability with our realism will find the flight model too demanding. Be prepared to constantly fiddle with the trim controls to maintain straight-and-level flight, even with the auto-pilot on.I have found this program to be somewhat unstable on my P-IV machine running Windows ME. It hasn't crashed often enough to be a serious problem, though."
1,Combat Flight Simulator 2,"I aslo own Combalt Flight Simulator WWII Series which I enjoy, 5 Star. Simulator II is too animated, has too personal a story line. I buy a Flight simulator to fly. I was a pilot instructor in the 60's. The story line in the WWII Series provides information about the war and the planes which provides the interest and needed information. It would be very hard for me to say that Simulator 2 is as much fun and as interesting as WWII Series."
3,Good fun for its time,"I bought CFS2 when it first came out, and it has given me much pleasure over the years. It remains my favorite of the CFS series, with good graphics and an enjoyable player interface. Runs well too, especially on today's computers. There are a host of free and commercial add-ons that enhance every aspect of the game. I have to say that since the advent of IL-2, it has been outclassed as a combat flight sim, but it can still offer the user a lot of enjoyment."
4,"Fighters ONLY, no Torpedo Runs for you!","I love the game, but as a player you are restricted to the seven fighter aircraft in the game. I was very disappointed that there were no missions where you dive bomb or torpedo the Japanese at Midway in a dedicated dive bomber or torpedo bomber, nor can you fly a Japanese torpedo plane at Pearl Harbor...things you could do in the older game Aces of the Pacific. Overall, alot of fun and great graphics with an Nvidia GeForce 256 GTS 64MB DDR video card. Just wish the game had a wider scope."
2,Too much software for average computer,"This software takes much more than an average computer. The specs on the box are seemingly misleading. I have at least twice what the minimums are and can't get the job done. Without a GREAT graphics card forget about even approaching the games capabilities.My machine is not even one year old and has good graphics capabilities and processing power. It runs CFS1 without a single problem. However, I am unable to even begin to enjoy the total package of this latest installment. I must choose between great 3D terraign effects or planes that look like a ""rainbow of colors"", for example. It is all in the choices (which are many) you are willing to accept. I want to lose myself in the simulation but this can't be done with multi-colored buildings and ships.While I applaud Microsoft's effort on this one, I and others undoubtedly will need to invest in the latest processing techology AND MORE to get our dollars worth."
3,Jerky graphics make it unplayable,"I have a 750Mhz computer with a Diamond Viper V550 AGP video card (top of the line just a couple years ago). CFS Europe Edition runs beautifully even with the graphics cranked all the way up. CFS2 Pacific Edition plays very jerky, it can't be effectly played without losing the graphics. Stick with Europe unless you have a brand new $400 video card."
3,not too bad,"I,ve played this for a while--ordered it before it came out--but am now bored with it. My two buddies who come over to take turns in the cockpit feel the same way. So does my six year old grandson. The aircraft carrier landings are great fun, otherwise --don't bother. I am back to playing Combat Flight Simulator One. I have had it a lot longer and have yet to become bored. Also it takes up a lot less room on the hard drive. If microsoft could make a few minor improvements to this classic and re-issue it I would be absolutely delighted!"
1,CF Simulator would not load,"Unlike some of my other MS Flight Games this one,the MS Combat Flight Simulator 2 would not load on my Windows XP Desk top or my Windows 7 Laptop. Other Games load and play A OK."
4,Shooting down the enemy can be fun.,"The quality of the graphics is adequate. The missions are fine. The real joy is shooting down the enemy. I thought the instructions were lacking, even the ""help"" and instruction manual on the CD could be much better. It would be nice to have more options for aircraft. I think in general there is room for sophistication in the program. Nevertheless, it is just a bunch of fun to shoot down the enemy. I have had the game for several weeks, and while it will get old at some point, the novelty hasn't worn off yet."
4,Fun shoot em up flying game,This is a good WWII flying shooter with great graphics and easy controls. Works fantastic with my Sidewinder 2 Force Feedback stick on a PIII 1.1 GHz Win XP system. Also plays well on a 1.2 GHz Celeron system with integrated graphics running Win XP. This is not a game that you can play hours on end for days and feel like your getting challenged. Pull it out occasionally as a break from your other games and it will keep you occupied happily for several hours. At the current low price it's an easy addition to your gaming library.
3,World War Review,"This game has it's pros and cons. The graphics are exceedingly done with very intrequite pictures and scenes. Some computers can't have Flight Simulator 2 because the graphics and coloring is to good for the computer. I've expierienced it.This games pros are that you can lock on to bases or ships although it doesn't auto-target them. If you hit a cerain button then a big yellow square will go around the object you have chosen and keep track of it's location. Also when you lock on to it, on the top of the screen it tells what you've just locked on to.Another pro is that it's not only starting, taking off, flying, and landing. You actually get to fire missles, drop bombs, shoot at people, etc. It has no bounderies.One of the few cons in this game is that it gets a little dull after a while because it takes over an hour to complete one mission. (My mom always kicks me off by then.)This is a great game. Oh no! I've been shot I'm going down."
5,WHOA!!!,"You find out how to fly, land and take-off. The controls are a bit hard, but it is fun. The missions are basiclly finding the [Japaneese]/Americans and bombing them. once you get use to the controls, it's on!"
4,Asome,"I'am only 11 and I have about every flight simulator there is. The graphics are good except when you get to low. The cockpit view is good and the sound is good. It's best to have a jostick. We had a hard time with it because we didnt have the rite joystick so if you are going to get it get a good joystick. You can fly planes like the Hellcat,Consair and Wildcat. You can fly Japanese planes like the Zero and George. The campain mode is asome. And if you have CFS1 you can play the Eroupen campain like I can. There is some problems thow. It can get realy boring if you dont have CFS1. Evan thow it says you can play two player you cant,and it's almost inposible to land on a aircraft carrier. Other wise get the game it's worth every penny."
2,Poor graphics and performance,"On a 450 AMD with 8mb of video this game was a great disappointment. Jerky motion and bad graphics greatly disppointed me. It is no better graphic wise then my copy of A10, would think the image quality would have improved over the years. When aircraft get near ground its pixel city bigtime. The quality of the zeros off in the near distance is terrible also. Aircraft response sluggish. I would think the Compaq which exceeds system requirments would be more than up to the task. Will most likely return this to the retailer."
1,Microsoft quality and ease of use,Microsoft support and installing drivers was not that fun. Tossed after one day.
3,Contact-Damage-Crash Modeling Very Weak,"Many have given this a thumbs up for realism. However, there is a category of realism which is sorely lacking in this game.Microsoft would do well to go back and replicate Jane's WW II Fighter's contact, damage, and crash modeling. There is _no_ comparison. With Jane's, planes are segmented into fuselage, cockpit, stabilizer, rudder, engine, and wings.In Janes, I have seen a plane crash land, and watched it's front end (engine) detach and cartwheel over the landscape. I've seen planes crash land, tear through ground targets, and demolish buildings in their wake. Another gamer said that while in a dogfight with Janes, they had their cowling blown off, and he saw parts in motion under the hood.THIS is realism. This you won't see in MS Combat Flight Simulator. Simply put, Janes' contact, damage, and crash realism is FAR superior.Much of MS CFS has great realism. But, in this category of realism, it is VERY poor."
3,"Great Game, but crashed TOO often","I recently bought cfs2 and was enthusiastic at first. But BEWARE! If you do not have a fast enough system, this game will crash VERY often. I have a pentium 4, but it still crashes about every 30 minutes of play times. Other than that, the game is realistic, has good planes, and is fun. Five stars WITHOUT the crashes."
5,Pacific War,I Was very happy with the game. Having the newer CFS3 I wanted to go to the pacific. Took me their with a vengeance. Nice touch with actual carrier landings.
2,Difficult,"I will admit that I had not played this format of a game before. However, I find it extremely difficult and frustrating."
2,All Flash and no Pan full of Cookies.,"Briefly; beautifully rendered graphics, potentially interesting scenarios. Lousy FPS, lousy AI, and any third party upgrade is simply painting the same fire hydrant a brighter color."
2,fair product,"I found the product to have poor graphics, ""comic book quality."" It was a big dissapointment after having used the original combat flight simulater which had better graphics, it has less detail but is more realistic."
4,Combat Flight Simulator 2 Recommended,"This game is magnificent. Graphics are execellent. Became very addicted to the game. I only wished that the Dauntless Torpedo bomber was also included in the aircraft inventory, and more missions were available (not the standard 30). Even though I am a Brit, I found the manual full of interesting American military/air history. Recommend it."
2,Some Serious Problems,"My copy of this game was marginal when I first loaded it. There are a few distrubing errors: 1.) your squadron mates do not have any landing gear, 2.)the gunsight is significantly off-center, 3.)the bailout image flutters superimposed on the crashing plane, and 4.)the throttle starts up at 100% evey time. In addition, my game just recently stopped responding to key or button strokes when launching rockets, bombs, or drop tanks. Microsoft has tried to help (if you want to call them and spend 9 or 10 bucks reloading and discussing options) but assured me that all the games share the gunsight and landing gear problems. Is this quality?"
3,Not so Great,It's either great graphics which are outstanding or great flying which is not when the graphics are running full tilt. Combat Flight Simulator WWII Europe Series is much better. It tried to do less and accomplished more. To get these aircraft flying you have to sacrifice too much in graphics. Microsoft tried to please too many and put too much in this which ruined the performance of the aircraft.
2,Bugs,"The game is really nice! Very nice graphics and scenery but the game always crashes on my computer! I had my computer for about 4 months and it is ruining my computer. I tried playing this game online with real people, and all this game does is crash when im online or playing it by myself! I uninstalled and installed it over & over again because I thought something might of happened during installation but nope. This game has many bugs for me and is very fustrating."
1,Regretful purchase,"Having purchased MS Flight Sims before, I assumed this one would be a similar type program. Instead, I find it uses comic book characters! My first inpression was disgust; misled and sorry for buying the product.The vendor I purchased this was J-R's and their service was absolutely excellent. The order arrived the same day another purchase from Amazon arrived. This was unprecedented and truly excellent service. I thank the vendor for their services, but the product was a ""bad buy""."
4,It's great but to hard.,This games is great!The graphics are absolutley awsome.The only thing is that once you get farther in the game it isn't clear and then the missions are impossible.
1,Very disappointed,"Trully the worst game in my collection. I was so pleased with combat flight simulator, I couldn't wait for CFS II, boy was I disappointed. To play I have to completely reinstall every time, otherwise I get a loading sign and nothing ever happens or it tells me to insert disk which is already inserted. When it does run the graphics are terrible. I have spent about the same amount of money with calls to Microsoft Tech Support as the game cost. I have dozens of games of ever kind (eleven fighter games) and never had any problems except with this one. I would like to get B-17 but after this piece of junk I am leary."
1,Major Disappointment,"How unfortunate it is that Microsoft has failed to at least match the great fun that was (and is) CFS1. This program is huge(850MB for the default installation)and seemingly it requires the very latest hardware to have it work properly. For this size of program, one would expect it the blow you away, but it is nothing but a great disappointment. From the illegible tactical displays to the small aircraft size to the cartoon intro, this waste of my money really turned me off."
2,Pretty good: not great,"When I got the game, I was all hyped up about it, because it was my first flight sim. It is a pretty good game. But after a while is got redundent and a bit boring. Here are the positives and the negatives.Positives:-Great plane graphics: inside and out-Great bullet simulation: the g-force is really realistic-Realistic missions: you have wingmen, etc.-Landing and taking off is fun: starting the engine, throttle, etc.-Awsome crashing graphics: tail or wing flies off and your plane is flamingNegatives:-It's very hard to learn the controls: basically it's ""find out for yourself""-Unless you have a joystick, it's not nearly as realistic-The guy who speaks to you on the radio is almost incomprihensable-The ship size to your size is not realistic at all-Ships are basically grey blobs with towers on them-For one plane the controls are twisted-The tail rudder hardly works at allAll in all, the graphics are great but the controls are messed up"
4,Good flight sim,"This is a very enjoyable game and easy to get into right away, despite what other reviewers say. True, if you jump in with fully realistic modelling of plane behavior and agressive enemies you'll have a very hard time staying alive. Being new to flight sims I took the wimpy route and used easy modes wherever i could to start out with, and I quickly became interested and started using harder settings. A flight yoke is a must, of course. Dont hope to fly with just a keyboard. Also, if heavily action-oriented games (FPSs and stuff) are your thing you may get bored with this game after a few hours. Alot of the fun is in learning to effectively fly the different planes and outfly enemies. Though the action is great, this game is really more about skill acquisition than about blowing things up. That said, it's extremely gratifying to watch your enemies burst into flames and shed pieces as your tracers tear through them."
1,Pass on This,We thought a cheap phone was good enough for our cellar. But this cheap one didn't last very long. A few number buttons began sticking the first few uses and the volume varied. We tossed it and paid for quality.
5,The Best Rock Band in Ages!!,"Tired of the classics, but dissillusioned with the lack of butt kicking rock out there. Cant take the shimmy shiny corporate slick bands like Korn and Greenday. Well, step up into this backwoods hillbilly on crack and downer sound. Not as neat as those sissie bands, and just about the only thing good to have come out in ages. If you hate this band then you are a glossy boy with honey in your little ears."
2,rhythmic noise......................,there is no trace of melody here - it is just noises arranged in such a way to create a rhythm. Well done but a bit boring.
5,Good machine,"This is my first food processor and it works well. The motor is relatively quiet and it sounds like it's a solid motor. The buttons are easy to wipe clean. It holds a lot plus has a tiny bowl that you can use for tiny amounts, which is a little easier to clean. I have zero complaints. I got it after using America's Test Kitchen cookbook which references using a food processor in tons of their recipes. So if you want more ways to use your FP then I suggest that cookbook. They also rate this food processor as their #1 recommendation."
5,Quiet and fast,"Once I figured out how to unlock the base, I fell in love with this processor. I could hardly believe how quiet and fast this machine is! My husband was in the living room, and didn't even know I was using it, because he couldn't hear it at all from the next room. My previous processor sounded like a chain saw, so this was a pleasant surprise. The machine has handled everything I've tried so far, slicing potatoes, shredding hard cheese, mixing dough and making hummus. I would definitely recommend this product."
5,Love at first pulse ...,"I had wanted a food processor for a very long time, but was afraid to overspend on features/gizmos I didn't need or underspend and get an inferior product. I think I found the right balance in this one!In just over an hour I was able to take it all out of the box, clean it all (plus theKitchenAid 9 and 12-Cup Food Processor 5-Disc SetI bought to go with the processor), make a batch of hummus, clean the parts I used, make a batch of nut butter, and clean what I used again.One thing I didn't see a lot of reviewers mention was how QUIET this food processor is! I was able to hold a conversation at nearly normal level while working with it. To me, that is a very big plus!The only thing I see so far as a drawback is it is a little challenging to clean the multipurpose blade where the blade itself mounts. As long as you pay attention while you clean (and clean right away) it should be fine, but it did take some extra passes to get it free of food."
5,excellent!,"I love to cook but resisted getting a food processor for many years due to storage / space limitations. We moved a couple of years ago and now have adequate space so I can keep it on the counter top where it is easily accessed and used regularly. Makes quick and simple work of so many tasks I used to do by hand or using manual tools, e.g. fresh bread crumbs, fresh cranberry-orange relish, etc. Cleans easily in the dishwasher; no hidden / hard-to-clean cracks and crevices. Wanted this particular brand and model as it was the highest rated in an equipment test by the good folks at Cooks Illustrated / America's Test Kitchen. Love it."
2,2-year update,"After a year of light use, the bowl and lid started cracking to the point that I now have to replace them. In order to crush dried bread into crumbs I have to run it for a long time. I second the comments about the very limited capacity of the bowl due to the short center stem. The smaller bowl is near worthless at best due to having to wash both bowls afterwards. There are other design flaws, such as the food pusher being 2 inconvenient parts, the difficulty of lifting off the bowl (you have to remove the knife blade first), and the lid clamping onto the outside of the bowl which sprays crumbs onto my kitchen counter even while running it. Powerful motor but not great design. I'm buying Braun next time."
2,Handle Molded After First Washing - Gross!,"The very first time we used this we noticed water in the handle after washing it. In time the water became mildew. By the time we notified Kitchenaid our warantee was up. We were told it was not an error with the unit, that we were using it wrong!(???) I guess we were washing it too thoroughly. We were told we could buy another cup for $99. After spending $200 on the unit it felt it was lousy customer service. I gave it two stars because it works properly if you can ignore the yuck factor. I uploaded pictures for everyone to see."
3,Not as wonderful as anticipating for two design reasons,"I bought this following the recommendations from Cook's Illustrated, and then was interested to see that it came with an ad for their magazine. I would look at a different model if I were doing the purchase over for two reasons, or stick with a stand mixer.1. The lid has a rim that catches flour or sugar. When you unscrew and remove it, the flour scatters over the counter making a clean-up chore.2. The bowl is deep, but the center post is short. That means that you can't really put more than about 3 inches of material in before the food runs over down the center post. I continually get bread dough or tomato juice down that post."
5,Wonderful,"Purchased as a gift and at least once a week, my daughter says how muchshe loves this Processor, we both use only Kitchenaid and have all theirproducts......Very worth buying."
2,Good product for the price you deserve a better made product,"I have had this food processor for a 3 years and right a way the plastic on the handle cracked in the first year. I only use it at the most maybe once every two months. We use ours mainly for holiday and large amounts of slicing, etc. I was putting in some cheese for pizza and it striped the plastic shaft that turns the blades. Yes the main piece for mixing and turning the blades is plastic. Why I don't know. I had an oster kitchen center for 18 years and nothing ever disapointed me with it. My husband bought me this kitchen aid as we thought it was a step up. Sad to say I wish I had my oster center back. I thought I would call kitchen aid and they were not helpfull at all. They said the 1 yr warrenty is up. It is 3yrs old. For the Money I was so dissapointed"
4,easy use and time saing,"This product is a time savor, every one should have one of these.It actually works great, shredding and slicing disks work great. The shredding disk that comes with it is a bit thin for our use, but it's Ok.I don't think that the safety issues cause any problem or are annoying.The only problem is when you are mixing something like mashed potatoes, the mix sometimes gets into the blade shaft, and it's almost impossible to clean it completely."
5,"My wife fell in love with me a second time, or was it the processor?","Man this thing is a beast. We've been punishing it with daily use for about 6 months and it's still kicking. It can reduce an hour of food prep down to about 10-15 minutes. Makes killer hummice that my middle eastern friends ask me for seconds. Just use it as the directions state. Don't overfill it or try to process items that you shouldn't (nuts, extremely hard frozen foods, etc.) and it'll work great!"
1,"Poor design - classic example of ""over engineering""","I am sorely disappointed with this machine. It's a classic example of taking a simple concept and making it complicated.There are too many little pieces, gadgets, and whiz bangs that you have to assemble in order to make it work. The small bowl is too small, and frequently leaks over into the large bowl. All of the little nooks and crannies in the various blades and other attachments collect all of the food bits and are hard to clean.You can't get much into the small bowl, and the large bowl doesn't do a good job of chopping or processing with a smaller batch. No happy medium here. For the price, you'd think you could get a machine with variable speeds, too.The only good feature it that it runs quiet. I've used Kitchenaid products for years - that's why I bought this one. However, this one is a real disappointment. Be sure and try one or see a demo BEFORE you lay out the bucks for this work of art...."
5,"KitchenAid KFP750PK 700-Watt 12-Cup Food Processor, Cook for the Cure Komen Foundation Pink","This processor is the last one you will ever want or need. It is powerful, yet quiet. It will chop those hard carrots quicker than any other without bogging. You wont be dissapointed."
4,pretty neat,"having used it four or five times already(within ten days of purchase), i find it has no problem performing as advertised, no matter which option or operation i use. only time will tell if it is a ""lasting"" thing, but so far it is fine."
4,"Our new food ""professor""","We like it a lot. The feature with the small bowl within is very helpful many times when there is only something small, little to process. The kneading feature can only be used for very small quantities in our present experience. But we have not given upon that yet. It is an excellent machine!"
5,Kitchenaid kfp750ob,I bought it do do dough.It works. Heavily built.It does what it is supposed to do
5,great for making baby food purees,I have been making my own baby food and this product has made it so easy compared to the hand grinder I was using before. In a couple of months this processor has paid for itself compared to the money I would be spending on baby food. Plus the great bonus of feeding my child unprocessed organic food is awesome.
5,FOOD PROCESSOR WORKS GREAT,I RECENTLY ORDERED THIS KITCHENAID FOOD PROCESSOR AND AM DELIGHTED WITH IT. IT IS VERY QUIET AND GRATES AND SLICES WITH EASE. I HAVE USED THE DOUGH BLADE AND THAT WORKS VERY WELL TOO. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.
5,Great food processor,"This Food processor has plenty of power, is user friendly, and is well built. I like the storage box for the additional components which are dish washer safe! If you are looking for a food processor this one should be right at the top of your list!"
5,Nothing but wonderful!,America's Test Kitchen recommended this and once again I agree with their assessment. The smaller bowl insert is great for small batches.
5,Highly Recommend,"Kitchen-Aide need I say more! This product is excellent, I love and use all the time!If you are looking for a quality processor this is the one! I believe this is the bestfor the money!"
3,Kitchenaid self-mutilating food processor,"This machine is the best one I could find and that is a sad thing. When the slicing blade is in use, the container does not fill evenly. The softest vegetables pile up in one spot when it is half full pushing the blade up which begins shaving plastic off the cover into your produce. I have about 10 jars of organic red sauce with plastic shavings that I could not detect until after canning. Also, the blade clogs easily and then the machine begins to roar and rumble and jump off the counter. When slicing several onions, be prepared to open and remove clog at least once per onion. What do the rich and famous do for a food processor these days? Surely not this. Not with a bang but with a whimper do things become obsolete before we bring them home."
