1,I could have saved $10....,"If I would have read the reviews before buying this thing. Slippery. Bunches Up. Icky feeling. Ditto all the bad reviews, no sense in repeating them. Dangerous. Garbage Can."
1,very uncomfortable,"I was so excited to try this as it is touted as the ""world's most comfortable"" bathtub mat and I paid twice as much for it. NOT! I was shocked to discover you can feel the suction cups poking through and it is not comfortable to step on at all. Besides that, it doesn't stay flat and gets all bunched up when stepped on. I think I'll go back to the plain old flat kind we grew up with."
1,Suction cups didn't stick,"If you have a plastic shower with textured floor, the cups probably will not stick. Porcelain might be OK. For me, this was a waste of money."
1,Misleading Publishing Date,The summary about the book is misleading since it sais that it was published in 2012 when in fact it is a new edition of an old book. It was a gift and the person already had all three books. I thought I was giving them something new.
1,Worst Nora Roberts book I've ever read!,"I was really looking forward to reading this when I read some of the other reviews, but I was really dissapointed. I could not get into this book. It was such a struggle, half way through the book I gave up and deleted it off my kindle. There was nothing redeeming about these self centered characters, and the plot failed to deliver."
3,Good Afternoon Read,"After hearing many wonderful things about Nora Roberts, I decided on this title as my first book by her. The book is a good afternoon read because it flows smoothly, the characters are vivid and the reader is taken to beautiful places. But, I thought the plot was shallow and predictable. The main character was the housekeeper's daughter! However, I look forward to reading a few more titles before comparing her to other romance novelists."
4,Very good trilogy,I like the trilogy as I find they often round off the ending to the previous one.However some of the trilogies are very very similar in theme.
5,Nora Love,So Awesome that I can read her books on my ipod now and not have to worry about what books to take with me on vacation. If i need another book i can download it. awesome...
4,Love and friendship,Great read about friendship and love. 3 friends experiencing life's journey. Love and loyatly will always stand the test of time. Margo makes you want to root for her to survive.
1,Daring to Dream,This book was a total disappointment. It was completely predictable and quite boring unless you like to be entertained by the sexual descriptions. I must have missed something in this story as many past readers have raved about this book. I just thought it was a pretty weak plot.
5,Nora Roberts,Nora Roberts is a great writer and I enjoy reading her books. She is very creative in her writings of love stories. She's such a romantic!
3,Entertaining,Entertaining reading. Nora Roberts usually gets you really caught up with the characters she creates and their lives and situations.
4,Another winner by Nora Roberts!,"After reading a few chapters in this book, I found out that I did not really like Margo as a person. This book also reminded me of the movie ""Sabrina"". Margo was not very appreciative of what she had, and did not treat her mum very well, (of course her mum did not treat Margo very well either) She straightens out her life after her glamorous world she created for herself in Europe came crashing down, and she found out that family loyality was the best gift. Her dream ended up helping her and her two sisters grow. This is a good book, but number 2 is the best, and number 3 the second best of the triology."
4,Another good one,Nora Roberts has done it again! I enjoyed this story so much. A few weeks later I even re-read it again.
4,Romantic ;0),"This book is magnificent. I found myself so engAGED in the story. I am just amazed at how Nora Roberts can make you feel. The romantic scenes with Margo and Josh were so powerful. The passion, desire and love between the two of them was so strong. You could only wish you had that type of love in a lifetime. Bravo Nora you are magnificent.Feel free to join my book group on Facebook (Romance Novel Junkies) and fan page ( Romance Novel Junkies Book Reviews).

2,An unsatisfiying book.,"I could easily put down this book as it lacked the thrill and excitement that most Nora Roberts books have. I bought all three books in the trilogy at once and so I am looking forward to reading the second book, Holding The Dream in hope that it will be better than the first."
1,I dreamed for an end to this book.,I could hardly belive this was written by the same person who wrote the Born In trilogy. Nora what happened. None of the main characters in these 3 books were sympathetic. Between whining and complaining and dumping on the men these women deserved to stay single. Please Nora don't write books like these anymore.
2,Ugh!,"The only reason I gave this book two stars rather than one is the HILARIOUS scene where Peter and Josh play tennis. Otherwise... yuck!! First of all, I found it very unrealistic that Margo would simply be able to channel all of her love for modeling into love for her store. You aren't forced out of a high-profile career like that without a LOT of emotional fallout. Second of all, Josh treated her like dirt! Always being the one with the control, making snide little comments about how she brought it on herself. I wonder how well HE would have done without the Templeton family name and fortune behind him. Margo may have been whiny, but she built her career from the ground from scratch and had a lot more inner strength than I saw from Josh. Not that I liked either one all that much."
2,Very annoying heroine!!,"I have to agree with another review that didn't like the heroine. She was spoilt, selfish, too self absorbed, a smoker ....need i go on? I love Nora Roberts, but this book was just too slow i was skipping pages! Thus the 2 stars!Like another review, i am so looking forward to reading Kate's and Laura's stories b'se they seem much more interesting. Ugh! This Margo! So stuck up!"
2,UGH!---,Two shallow people end up together after a lot of whining and bickering. They deserved each other and I deserved a better story that didn't waste my time.
3,Just average only,I find the book is just OK only (not as good as the Born In series). I find that the heroine is a tad too selfish. Don't really like her much
2,"Good writer, boring story","Not a page-turner. This was my first Nora Roberts book and I wasnt impressed. I am used to Nicolas Sparks interesting reads, so I might not be rating this fairly. I didn't like it, and did not buy the other two books in the series."
2,daring to dream,"Not her best work, Daring to Dream seemed lackluster and had too much harsh language and the characters didn't seem believable"
4,"A great series, good characters and great byplay","Another Nora Roberts classic. Great characters, more complex than previous books.Characters are appealing, no weak pathetic women that you find in normal romance books!"
5,Loved it,"Josh was ""A man from your dreams"" kind of hero. Good looking, loving, sexy, and the one that take care of you. Margo was having some troubles finding that she wasn't enjoing her dream as much as she thought she would. Together with Lora and Kate the book is fill with loughter and smiles."
2,VERY lacking,"This CD is okay, but some of the tracks the makers chose to put on it were just horrible ideas. The CD has some good songs at the beginning, but as it progresses the songs get worse and worse, until you just want to hurl some blunt object at your CD player. You really should buy some other Rockabilly CD. There are some that are really much better."
4,Pretty Good,"This book was not too bad, infact it was a joy reading it. It kept me reading throughout the late hours of the night. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes history and war books. I'm not saying that this book it full of action and war though, there were parts which were not such a joy reading. But, still most of the book was good, in my opinion."
4,An enemy Among Them,"This was an interesting, good book. It's a little boring in the beginning, between pgs 1-10, but you get hooked after that. It's about mainly Margaret Volpert, and another main character is Private Christian Molitor, a Hessian. Margaret's family has a son, later 2, in the American army though they are German. When Margaret meets Christian, she sees how both sides' boys are the same, neither are evil. They're just fighting for their country, doing what they're told, what they believe in. But Christian has a secret that could turn Margaret against him..."
3,I've read better...,"Although the story and plot were good, i had to go through at least 20 pages of unnecessary boring details about the stupidest of things. But over all I liked it. The love story was amazing and the ending was fantastical!"
1,An Enemy,"1.There is an enemy in the house and Margret doesn't know what. To do. A Red Coat is inside Margrets house and finds out, what is she to do.2. My opinion the book sucks, theres no action, it is the saddest book there ever was, not sad as in crying, sad as in bad.3.The theme don't let strangers into your home.4. I recommend this book to the people who likes historic books."
4,flowerpower,"Mike Dash has written an engaging work on a rather obscure subject-tulips. I bought this work to find out about his style before reading ""Batavia's Graveyard"" and found it enjoyable. My only real quarrel with Dash is his tendency to skip around on dates and events. It is quite distracting."
3,Tulipomania,Interesting but a bit on the dry side with lots of details. I using it for a paper and am having trouble condensing the information.
3,Not terribly interesting.,"A meticulously researched book, but not one I found terribly interesting. The most interesting material tended to be background or related bits of history, but this did not comprise enough of the book. I had a little trouble with the biology of new species development: the explanation was all there, but perhaps just a little more leisurely discussion would have been helpful."
1,Read the Simon Schama book instead.,"Forget this book and read a far more interesting treatment of the times and the unbelievable tulip trade:The Embarrassment of Riches : An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Golden Age by Simon Schama.Tulipmania may be a quick read, but substance always wins over a quick read."
3,Error page 71,"ERROR PAGE 71""Spanish monopoly...East Indies.""should be ""Portuguese monopoly...East Indies.""Spain was in the West Indies in the 1600's"
2,A Disappointment,"I had such high hopes for this book after reading all the reviews and hearing so much about the 'tulip craze'. I also love popular history books that focus on a single topic, like The Arcanum by Janet Gleason ( a brilliant read!). This book meandered so much and completely failed to capture my interest. I ended up skimming most of it and couldn't wait for it to end!"
1,Flat History,"I'm a history buff that discovered the tulip mania phenomenon and was eager to read an exciting, in-depth account of a truly fascinating piece of history. Mike Dash's non-fiction attempt, laden with cumbersome statistics and repeated points, was disappointing and impossible to read through as anything but research. The focus jumps around and is hard to follow or care about without any connecting characters or themes, and I was thoroughly disappointed overall with this book. Someone needs to get to work on a piece that does justice to this incredible time and place."
1,Audio problem,"I purchased the 13"" AQUOS in February of 2005 & in May the volume went on one channel. All the other channel's were fine. Since it was such a short time, my retailer replaced the whole unit. Now less than 7 months later it has happened again. One station is not audible unless I put the volume up as far as it will go, 60. Again all the other channels sound fine at their normal setting of 16. This is very frustrating."
4,As good as I remembered,"I have been looking for the CD that contained ""No Sad Song""&""Tulsa Turn Around""for quite awhile, but it is very hard to track it down. I was very happy to find this CD, and I am very pleased with my purchase."
3,Big Thoughts Do Come In Small Packages,"A Peanuts fan for life, I couldn't resist bundling this up with some Amazon orders last April 2010. It contains quotable quotes on LIFE as viewed by Charles Schultz's philosophical bunch. Note that it is a very tiny boxed set--the books itself are half the size of a regular cell phone. File this one under ""nostalgia."""
3,3.5 stars,"I rented this movie and glad i did .the acting is not bad , and has likable characters .It did'nt have a low budget look or feel to it ."
2,THE ROAD GOING NOWHERE,"Moody but muddled mishmash of satanic silliness. A group of travelers on a bus headed for Las Vegas find themselves sharing the road with some kind of demon who kills people and then takes their places. The demon is supposedly a witch whose lover was lynched several years earlier. The script is so disheveled, however, and it's hard to keep up with what's going on right up to the inevitable twist ending. Shane Brolly, Al Sapienza and other actors are defeated by the contrived premise. For fans of the genre only."
4,"schmaltzy, but satisfying","This is a fine collection of songs from the late 50's and early 60's. This is the period when, like Ray Charles, she was singing over sugary string orchestras. Her voice is there and strong, but the schmaltz may not be for everyone. You have been warned.Note: These are stereo mixes, the originals were probally mono, but I could be wrong."
5,Great!!!,This item is awesome! It really makes the snacks you bake in your oven much cripier!!! Definitely worth it!
5,Tracy's first and maybe best program,"I bought this book about 10 years ago and have been a fan of Brian Tracy ever since. This guy knows how to bring out the best in people. Although Brian Tracy has written many books, this was his first and in my opinion, his best.Great book that will change your life."
5,A good reality check on your life up to today...,"A good sign of a good self help book is if it is easy to relate to, and is easy to read. This book passes both of these tests. If you are open and honest with yourself, this book is a great partner in evaluating how you got where you are, and then, where do you want to be. The only drawback is various lists and rules of life, which would be hard for anyone to ""study"". But they do provide a good way to do self evaluation. I read the book in about six hours and was a very good investment of time and money."
5,Kill the root of negativity inside you...READ THIS BOOK,"We all have ""band-aids"" for depression, worry , and fear, but to really be able to cure the cause we have to go deep inside ourselves. This book shows us that what we are is what we have learned over time. Everything that has been learned can be ""un-learned"". Every negative thought or reaction to stressors in our lives can be illiminated, or at least controlled, through the methods outlined in this book. It is by far the best book I have ever read. It saved me."
2,Average book,This is probably not the best way to buy a book but after seeing all the 5 stars that this book get from the reviews I felt it must be a very good book. I am sorry to say that I am disappointed. This book tells you what you should do but not HOW to do it. Perhaps after reading Tony Robbins book Awaken the giant within I was not able to appreciate this book. It is amazing how many poeple give this book 5 stars but I must say I agree with the previous user who said that this book is just fluff. I couldn't agree more with that person.
3,"Useful but not the ""Bible"" it claims to be","The first half of this book is a sensational glomeration of all the best 'self helps', and is tied together extremely well. However, Some contradictions start creeping in midway, and with the exception of the ""Power of Love"" chapter, the second half fails to maintain the standard of the chapters up to and including the goal setting techniques. Maybe Maximum Acheivement tried to cover too many bases with one book, and lost me towards to the end."
2,He has written only ine book,"Brian Tracy has some good ideas, but he has written perhaps only one book, the contents of which he keep repeating in different books and programs. Most of his stuff is taken from the great Earl Nightingale."
5,The best of it's kind...,"This book is all the things that anyone could want to get your life a jump start to bigger and better things. For starters tracy presents a system for achivement that is not just a re-hash or synthesis of everything you have already read. It presents his system in a clear precise way that is beneficial to anyone in any walk of life. You don't have to be in sales.This book motivates, stimulates and helps you focus your mind on meeting your goals. He helps you in defining your goals and meeting them. Yes this is a PMA thesis but there is much more.Finally tracy does what any worthwhile motivational teacher will do. He tells you that you will have to work hard. There is no attempt to portend that success can be had with a handful of magical formulas. You need to organize your thoughts, think positively and then do it! This book will help you do that.Maximum achievement is the think and grow rich of this generation. I recommend it to everybody on earth!.............socks"
4,Steep discount for a good book.,"This book is exactly the same as the Nightingale Conant audio program 'The Psychology Of Achievement,' however at a muchmore agreeable price. Depending on your favoured learning style, buy either the book or the audio program. Brian Tracy'sstory has been told too many times for me to repeat, however this book has a good heart."
5,This Book Provides Specific Strategies,"This book provides specific strategies to use to obtain your goal. I have bought so many self help books. The great majority of them offer short term motivation but not specific strategies. This book offers you strategies or techniques you can use. Don't just read the book. Read the book, highlight the parts where Brian offers you specific techniques and use them."
5,my first time purchasing a used book online,The seller gave a accurate description of the books condition. It was sent with a timely manner. A small note that said thanks and enjoy was a nice personal touch on the receipt I will recommend to others to purchase books from them and I will also in the future!
1,Writing goals does NOT work.,"If someone can cite the Yale study Brian Tracy references that demonstrates the effectiveness of goal setting, I'll change this review to 5 stars.None of the successful people I've known ever wrote down their goals, that I'm aware of (and I can't imagine them doing so).The only ppl who write goals are the same ppl who buy these books (I'm one of them)...not successful people.It's amazing how many times I've heard Tracy say, ""Champions do this, successful people do this,"" as if he's noticed these champions perform this strange, obscure behavior. No, he just think the behavior makes sense to him, so he claims that champions do must do it."
2,Turn man into machine,"Success in the current society means making a man into machine, and if you want to become an efficient machine, this book is for you my friends. All goal orientation only means that you are not happy and fulfilled in this moment and think that you will be able to in the future. It is the biggest lie and these kind of book do nothing but only this stuff. We are not machine, do not try to become one. To all of us life has provided everything in abundance, enough food, air, water, sex. So why to become restless. I gave this book 2 stars because of it's last chapter on love. Else look around you, all the restless people, outcome of this kind of books"
5,LIVE YOUR DREAMS...READ THIS INCREDIBLE BOOK!,After my 2nd reading of this book my life made a complete U-turn towards Success and living my dreams. It is THE WORKBOOK for anyone desiring to live life to its fullest and was paramount in helping me to determine what I needed to do to achieve EVERYTHING I desire in life. E-Mail: APSystems1@aol.com
4,Fun,Bought this for my 8 year old grandson. He has a lot of fun with it. And of course I had to play with it too.
3,Could have been better,"This book was supposed to have several different types of planes, but only had one that flew. I would have liked it to have better instructions for a 3rd grader to understand."
1,Almoust mothing about Jabber Programming,Please do not be fooled by title. Less then 1/3 of the book covers Jabber programming itself. Most of book is about ... how to configure Jabber client authors developed (actually about 1/3 of book). Language is very primitive. Development environment is VB 6.0. Absolutely useless book.
3,Read my review in depth the product has faults for sure,"Few things that u should first know about this item.It is absolutely not a correct size figment !It is off by 1/8inch no matter how You align it .Second problem is the glass is slightly beveled contour so when u try to adhere it to the old glass it doesn't lay flat.It's probably better for this to be put in place of the old removed glass.Do not use the tape use clear liquid nail and tape mirror for one day to assure adhering is proper.I guess it's ok for the price but don't expect excellence .Buy Oem if u want perfection ,otherwise the glass is nice itself clean seems to be strong but the contour and cut is off a little ."
3,Not very good,"The mirror was in very good condition, the only problem I had with the product was the adhesive. The adhesive they provided me with is comparable to the adhesive you get from office depot to stick a dry erase board on your bedroom wall. In less than three weeks, the adhesive started peeling off and my mirror nearly fell off while I was driving! Luckily I had super glue available so let's see how long that'll last."
2,ok,"This flea control for cats worked well when I first put it on, but it smelled like I was putting gasoline on their backs. And it definitely didn't work for a whole month like it was supposed to. After a week or two, they had more fleas, either from the eggs that were supposed to be killed by this stuff, or by more fleas jumping on them. It didn't kill fleas the way it should.The stuff I get from the vet works much better. Go to a vet and ask for Advantage. My vet sells it in individual doses and it seems to work better. It kills anything that bites the animal. So, any new eggs that hatch will also be taken care of."
5,One of the best drama series ever,"I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting the beginnings of one of my favorite TV shows. The characters, stories and action are exciting, and getting to watch on DVD is unbeatable. Anyone who's into legal dramas and hasn't seen much of The Practice should indulge themselves. I can't wait till more DVDs are available!One thing that makes this series stand out is the way it explores the human element of the law business. We see defense/litigation attorneys, prosecutors, and judges, as normal people. Shades of gray in the law itself are debated, along with the biases of everyone involved. Defendants and litigants involve themselves in decisions, often using their own knowledge of the legal system, in hopes of contributing to or manipulating their cases. And, we get to see into the characters' personal lives, often in very entertaining ways."
5,The Practice,"Very good, but I do wish that David Kelly and Fox DVD would release a bumper pack of all 8 series in one issue,it would save a lot of time and frustration"
1,Call me when they are done,"Why would I buy 1.3 Seasons of an eight season show? I own some shows on decent DVD set, so I know it can be done."
5,Keep them coming,It's about time that they released The Practice on DVD. One of the best David Kelly series. Someone please just make sure they continue to release the rest of the seasons!
5,Excellent,"While less glamorous than Boston Legal which was a spin-off from this series, the series has some similarities: set in Boston it relates the story of a law firm. However the cases are more realistic and the tone more somber even if at time there as still the same strange cases that you found both in Boston Legal and Ally McBeal. While this box set contains relatively few episodes for reasons explained in other reviews, it is a very very strong series with excellent acting and writing."
5,Great show!,"This cast works. Unfortunately, I think thier show is more accurate as to the way the courts really work. It's a great show. Can't wait for the next season on dvd."
5,viewed seasons 1 - 3 already,so i will not be purchasing it here againwhat i will buy are seasons 4 - 8if it is made available here
5,awesome,I love this show and thought it would be great to add to my kindle to watch when I get ready
1,Patiently waiting....,"Where are the other seasons ????? Like others before me... I refuse to purchase a small fraction of a series on DVD without the promise of a complete set in the forseable future. I made that mistake with the Peyton Place TV series... bought ""Parts"" 1 & 2... and then NOTHING else was released !!! NEVER AGAIN !!!Addendom 5/12/12: So now it's been almost 1.5 years since my plaintive cry for the ENTIRE series on DVD... with NOTHING to show for it !!!! PLEASE release the ENTIRE series !!!!!"
1,Where's the rest?,"I would have rated this five stars because this was one of the best series on television. But like so many others, I don't want just one season.I want the entire set of eight seasons. When that's offered, I will buy it.The one star rating is for Fox and their silly marketing and ignoring their customers."
4,Great Background Music,"Just the thing for listening to while reading, talking or surfing. Bright, fanciful guitar work lifts your mood."
5,Gypsy Fusion is excellent,I bought over a dozen CD's from Amazon and immediately loaded them on my iPod and have been playing them often. Excellent musician and the recordings are clear and precise.
2,"No better than ""listenable""","NovaMenco have a lot of potential, but they have produced an average CD here. They are technically gifted musicians but this disk lacks heart and passion. The music is very repetitive...one hears the same pyrotechnic riff over and over in both of their albums.If you're looking for some outstanding neuevo flamenco guitar music try Oscar Lopez or Jesse Cook. If you want some of the real thing, hot enough to melt your heart, go for Chuscales. If you're just looking for some background music, NovaMenco may do."
1,Sounds the same,Listen to the sound clips - the only difference in songs is how fast or slow they play them. Were they meant to sound the same maybe? I don't get it. I'm sure glad Amazon let's you preview before you buy.
5,Excellent Flamenco Fusion,I listen to music of all kind. But this CD Gypsy Fusion I love the most. I went and bought NovaMenco's newest album Fortune Teller. Excellent Guitar music. The Best. I love it.
2,BOOTLEG!Beware!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS A BOOTLEG(ACORDING TO THE PICTURE.)!!!!!YOU CAN TELL BY THE TOY AND BOX.THE BOX HAS NO BANDAI LOGO OR COPYRIGHTS ON IT.THE ONLY GOOD THING IS THAT THIS TEACHES YOU THAT ITS A BOOTLEG!GO BUY ONE THAT HAS THE COPYRIGHTS AND THE BANDAI LOGO ON IT.
5,Dell Axim X30,"i received the unit in perfect working order with a fully charged battery, it has worked great for the few short weeks i have had it, one of the best purchases i have made :D it has help me immensely"
2,Dissapointed,"Bought the Axim in November, by January it died. This is the second purchase, hoped that the 2nd time would be a charm. While it WAS working, I enjoyed the user friendly components of the PDA. Just wish that it was reliable."
2,Difficulty making Axim work with Vista,"I have owned several Axims previously and thought that I would again be pleased with this PDA. The Axim X30 contains all the features I was anticipating and it appears that Dell had improved the unit from it predecessors. The trouble came in trying to get the unit to sync with my PC which is running Windows Vista Home Premium. First, the installation disc does not contain the software that allows you to create the appropriate synchronization links (it is outdated for Vista). You have to go and load Windows Mobile Device Center. After loading the new program I could get the units to acknowledge one another existed but I still could not get the 2 units to transfer data. I found that Dell no longer supports Axim units and Microsoft was no help either. I eventually returned the unit and purchased a Palm Tungsten E2 which, after loading the appropriate Palm software, functions smoothly."
5,Playboy January 2002 Chna Joanie Laurer Holiday Anniversary Issue,Magazine was arousing.Magazine arrived in a very timely fashion.Magazine arrived in excellent condition.
4,Well suited for sysadmins,"Microsoft's Windows XP is indeed a considerable improvement over its predecessors. But to the chagrin of many users, it is certainly not bug free. In response, Randall offers you many ways to improve the security and user experience.Of course, he assumes that you are already fairly familiar with your machine. This book is not meant for the total novice. But going through it can turn you into a power user. He starts by showing how to better control the user interface. There are things you can do with the control panel that are neat and often ignored in simpler texts.Actually, most if not all of the book can also be used by a system administrator. Very useful in answering those tricky questions from inquisitive users that want to push the envelope of the machine. The book helps you stay ahead of them."
5,Windows XP Solutions,This is one Part of two so get both..Have a problem? grab the books..I even bought another set for a friend of mine who is a retired pc tech and he loves them..--Phyllis
4,LOVE these,"My little one loves these bottles. They are easy to hold on to. Love that they don't drip and spill. And the cover makes a good seal if you are storing them with water in the diaper bag.Reason I gave them only 4 stars is the fact that we got such pastel girly colors. I have a little boy. We will use the yellow and lavender ones but the pastel pink is just a little too girly for me. Wish there was a way to specify which colors.The other ones we have were received as a gift and were bright blue, red, and green. So I know they make other colors than girl colors.Just a tad disappointed in the colors. We'll keep them in case we have a girl next time."
1,Like the bottle hate the nipple,"I really liked the quality of the bottle. It was sturdy, seemed of good quality, and nice looking. Unfortunately, my 3 month old was not able to get any milk out of the nipple. I ended up having to switch bottles in the middle of a feeding because he was screaming so much from not being able to get his food. Every baby is different and maybe in a few months I can try again but at this point, it is useless and I cannot recommend it."
1,A Horrible Edition,"I was seriously so excited to receive my copy of Time and Free Will. This edition disappoints on all levels. I can't help but imagine that all of the reviewers of this book just happened to like Bergson, read his essay a long time ago, and decided to try to influence others to do the same. Not a bad goal, except I looked at the good reviews, bought this copy, and ended up wasting my money. This book is a scanned copy of the online version of the original text. The translation is horrible, and there are textual errors, strange spacings, and phrases of complete gibberish throughout. For example: ""Therefore time is? joilndi ord Constructed as..."" Tons of errors like this. Find another copy, but do not buy this edition. It sucks."
1,Edition is defective,"The General Books LLC edition is entirely defective, a conservative estimate would put 1000 errors per page rendering the text unreadable. Serious lack of quality control"
1,Book was obviously a fake,"I needed this book for a college course. When it came, it looked like it was a xeroxed copy and although the book title and author was right, my professor had never seen anything like it. It was obviously a pirated copy and didn't even resemble the real copy. Luckily, I only needed the book for the last two weeks of my class...the professor was workable. If he had not been, I would have been screwed. I will never buy anything from this seller again."
3,Worked at first...,"My dog was a lot calmer for about the first week. I'm still on my first bottle of the stuff, but she's gotten used to it or something because it no longer has a soothing effect on her. It was great while it lasted!"
1,Ruined our wall,"While I wasn't surprised that this product didn't help our dogs (I assumed it was probably something that would work on some dogs & not others) - I was not happy that the plug-in caused the latex paint on the wall above it to bubble. It worked it's way through multiple layers of paint, so we were forced to strip the whole wall rather than just repaint the affected area."
3,These people were already successful,"I am a registered nurse and I read this book with anticipation of finding some useful information for middle management wear. As Mr. Molloy addressed only physicians, attorneys, reporters and upper executive positions it was of little benefit for me. The problem with any middle management nurse trying to use this information is the fact they would not only be wearing clothes to impress their employers but they would have to wear these same clothes as they walk the nursing units. I would have appreciated some guidance from Mr. Molloy for the nurse in middle management who want to look good for her meeting with upper management but must be able to walk into a patients room and perform some aspects of patient care."
2,"Good for the 70s, Useless now","While applying for jobs out of college, I bought this book for some help. I was dissapointed with the outdated information and learned little about dressing. I found that a subscription to Mens Health and the book Attention to Detail were infinitely better guides."
2,The Invisible Intruder,"New Women's Dress for Success was an informative book about how a man went about finding out what women should wear for the work place. I do however find it sad that women are being not only judged by their age and physical appearance in the workplace, but also, the clothes they wear. Whether the outfit be too frilly or plain, people see women everyday and look at them more critically than men. Malloy wants to help women dress so they can get the promotion? Well, good deal. However I find that society could benefit from hiring people by the skills they posess, not by the maker of their blouse."
1,NEW is hardly the appropriate word!,"The only thing new about this book is the insertion of the word new in the title. Whilst the fundamental methodolgy seems sound, this book is a total anachronism. It is riddled with references to class stereotypes which have been largely rendered redundant by the new economy. When the new generation of technology millionaires wear sneakers and T-shirts, advice on how to pick an ""old school tie"" to impress the boss simply doesn't cut it.There is, no doubt, a modern day ""dress language"" analogue to Molloy's original work, but there is scant evidence of it in this book. The methodology needs a fundamental re-work to bring it up to date and earn the title ""new"". If the author took the trouble to do this, no doubt he would have another best seller on his hands."
3,As a reference,I'm using it as a resource and it works for me in that regard. By making it available I avoid hurting feelings.
3,Solid information albeit dated...,"This book is one of only a few that talks about dressing for success based on years of dedicated research. Did you know that wearing a black raincoat pegs you as low class in the eyes of others? Neither did I until I read this book. What it will tell you is what suits, ties, etc. are associated with people in positions of power so that you may better dress the part. What it won't offer you is practical advice on how to select a good suit and the essential accessories. Above all, however, it is difficult to read this book without feeling that although it was published in 1995, it hasn't been seriously updated since 1988. $14 for a nice silk tie? Paisley still an acceptable option for the boardroom? Give me a break. All and all, a great place to start, but not the comprehensive modern reference for men's dress that it could be"
3,We men need a new update for the new millennium!,I will keep this short and to the point. We men need a new and updated version for the new millennium. This book is now nine years old. Our business fashions do not change as fast as women's but they do continue to evolve. A lot has changed during those nine years. The basics and color advice is good but we now need more up to date information.
2,On its Last Legs,"I forgot to check the copyright date when I purchased this book and was disappointed when I found out that I purchased a 1988 book. This book was written when Reagan was President. I continually had to take Mr. Malloy's advice and project how his advice would apply today. I should not have to do this for a book titled the New Dress for Success. On the other hand, the underlying principles this book presents -- your dress matters -- dress to suit the situation -- do your research -- still apply. Consequently, this book still provides useful information for someone who needs advice on business dress. On the other hand, the color photos are very poor. This is a shame because much of the information presented requires photos of what does not work and what does work."
2,A 'Dated Prospectus' For Investing in Yourself.,"Too old for me (1988) - I wouldn't invest in a company with a 12 year old prospectus, why would I (or anyone else) invest in me with 1988 ideas? Com'on 'Molloy', we've come to believe in you, don't let us down now, put the pen to paper and give us a '2000' edition."
3,OK CD,"Disappointed in the song selections, but Linda's voice was prime. Prefer the songs on ""Canciones de Mi Padre"" instead. More of the classics than on this one. Didn't know many of the songs."
3,"Devil Winds is entertaining, but...","When viewed simply as a story, I found the movie to be satisfactory. However, it did have a lot of footage of things you DO NOT do during a tornado...walking /running around in the debris field, leaving places of shelter, taking refuge in a culvert or under a bridge. These things are deadly, and in my opinion, the movie should have had a disclaimer to not do these things during a tornado. Of course a culvert is preferable to an open field, as is a bridge...but in Oklahoma, they have been proven to be deadly."
2,Couldn't watch,A full frame version. My admitted bias is widescreen. My mistake for not ascertaining the aspect ratio prior to purchase.
2,Coincidence?,"Each of the other reviewers gave this book five stars...solid...no hesitation. Each of the other reviewers is from the state of Ohio. Small world or huge coincidence? Or loaded reviews? What are the chances...out of 50 states? Marketing agents? It happens with music reviews. Check the book out from the library, first."
1,"Very, very bad",The copy is terrible and unreadable. I can get better print using my home copy machine. What a crap to pay more then a dolor.
2,desappointed,"Actually ,this book can't be reading... print quality is too bad, it's a pity...A purchase which is unnecessary...we wasted our money."
1,This version does not have the accents,The text does not have accents on my kindle. I wonder if it's my kindle or the version that is erroneous...
3,What?,The book was not what was expected. Perhaps we did not preview what we were buying well enough.
2,The text format of this book is terrible!,"Dumas rates five stars; the story rates five stars, but the formatting makes reading it on the Kindle a nightmare! The lines of text are fixed-length, and they are longer than the width of the Kindle page, even at the smallest character-set size. Thus each line displays as one full line, followed by a short overflow (or word-wrap) line. Ugh! I asked for, and received, my money back, and I deleted the item from my Kindle. I am VERY disappointed, as I wanted to read it in the original French, but I couldn't cope with the jerkiness that the ridiculous text formatting imposes on the reading process. (OK, I see others didn't seem to notice . . . so, I guess I'm picky. But there you are: my opinion, for what it's worth.)"
1,What?! No accents?,The kindle edition has no accents. I'm not sure how you can call it a book in French without accents. This is unacceptable.
4,follow up,"This is to follow up on my previous review. I'm 3/4's of the way through the book and so far I've noticed at least one word typo in each story. Granted this is a small thing to complain about but let's face facts, in these days of computers and spell checks, there should not be any spelling errors or typos! All in all, still a great book, it's just sad to see that the proof reading wasn't top rate."
3,Run-of-the-mill,"A collection of short stories and novella centered on the character of Kane, an (apparently) immortal warrior/sorcerer. The writing is o.k. but the character of Kane seems a little flat to me. It's run-of-the-mill swords and sorcery writing, obviously inspired by Robert Howard (Conan) but not as good."
1,I Wish This Song Would Go Away!!!,This song is more of a Destinys Child first album song. This didn't sound well coming out of a grown woman at all. I hate it.
3,Fairly Imprinted,"There really hasn't been anything widely definitive when it comes to R&B; recently. The past year it has been about Beyonce', mainly. She has tried to put up a tougher edge with her music, but she has shown a more upbeat side though. Her third single, Irreplacable, from her sophmore solo effort B'Day, is so far her most upbeat song off the record. The song is fairly catchy in her voice, and feeling of the song. I thought this wasn't a bad song, where there really hasn't been that many good songs that really stood out. I just hope though that her next single, tries to a bit better than this one.Song: C 1/2+"
5,An old soldier's barracks review,"I first read this engrossing story when I was 18 and living in the barracks in Germany in 1975. After I read it, almost everyone who could read in my Tank Batallion(killer tank, not water tank) read it and I never saw my copy again. It brings back so many memories to read again of Cugel the Clever and dream of the cusps. Tho' now I am 50 years of age."
5,The magnificent 2nd album!!!,"Make no mistake, this is the finest Swedish in style metal from Aarhus DENMARK. Hatesphere's 2nd album is even better than the ripping debut album from 2001. More versatile with more slower, real heavy passages and brutally grooving riffs. Good and classical use of keyboards by producer Tommy Hansen and a wider range in his vocal use by Jacob Bredahl. Especially check out the tracks ""Kicking Ahead"" and ""Low Life Vendetta"" along with ""Insanity Arise"" and ""Deeper And Deeper"". But all 9 tracks (european version) are extremly well written and virtuosly performed. Don't miss out on this great album, and be sure to check out the band live in action for a convincingly intense experience, featuring sublime performances by Mikael Ehlert and the rest of the band."
3,RSVP mini whisks - useful,"I've had these for quite a while now. No rusting at all - they're not supposed to but I was still worried.My only complaint is that the small one is really, really small. Like I haven't used it because I can't find a use for it. I use the larger one frequently and put it in the dishwasher.I purchased these for things like whisking an egg wash in a small bowl. Perfect for that use."
1,~~Arrived rusted inside the package~~,"I recieved the wisk and never had to open the package. One of the wisk was already rusted inside the clear package. Needless to say I am sending it back. Also they are much much smaller than I thought they might be. They are too short and also very small in size. Looks like they came out of a childs play kitchen set. If you are looking for very small cheap made wisk, then look no more. Other than that, spend a little more and get something you can use."
4,Work well,"These work well, but are smaller then I thought. Perfect for whisking small amounts in small bowls- like an egg or two."
5,what it says it is,basic but what i wanted what more can I say they are basic but that is what I wanted.... nice
1,They rust,The whisks rust are difficult to clean ... I have tried several mini wisk yet to find a real stainless steel set. I've settle on a spoon is the best solution.
1,IT's SOOOOOO BREGA!!!,"BREGA is the portuguese translation to LAME! Zeze e luciano are SOOOOOOO BREGA...I can't even describe how mediocre the 2 are as musicians! There's a lot of people in Brazil who likes this total imbecility, but there's also a lot of people who likes kinds like backstreet boys or Paris Hilton...So it seems like a lot of people don't understand what music is...."
1,Not the best out there,I have read many books on the Middle East. Some of which relate to this issue. This book is by far the worst I have ever read. It was long and boring. I had to skip many parts just to get through the book. This was such an important issue. She should have written it differently. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
2,a difficult book,When I started reading this book I felt great pity for Pat Roush and her girls. By the end of the book I still felt terrible for the girls but only annoyance for Ms. Roush.It's horrible to think about two American girls being trapped in one of the most repressive countries on Earth but what can be done really? Should a team of commandos be sent in to snatch the girls or should the American government hammer Saudi Arabia with sanctions?The first option won't fly. Nobody wants to see American soldiers get killed for the sake of a domestic dispute and if America punishes Saudi Arabia what about all the other countries? American children are in Germany and other European countries with their mothers and their American fathers can't even see them. The situation is also reversed. American parents have snatched children away from foreign born parents.This is a sad story and there is a lesson in it for the reader: think before you marry a foreigner.
2,Orginally Album Cover...not very orginal band,"I recently bought this album on a risk, seeing the very colorful and creative cover. However I should of listened to the phrase ""You can't judge a CD by the linear notes"". The band is not too orginal, and each song sounds the same...alternative music. They don't even seem to be into thier own music."
4,"Fun, probably worth $20","My 7 year old LOVES this toy. The first one we got did not work at all but we exchanged it for one that did.Not every UPC has a monster in it - maybe one in 20. But it's exciting when you get a monster. He had trouble understanding the directions for battle on his own but once I read them (a few times!) and explained them, he's been winning most battles and enjoying it.It's nice to have at the store and we find UPCs on everything now. If it was more than $... I would say don't buy it, because I can see him getting tired of it soon and I'm not the only one to have had a problem with one, but for $... he's had a blast.I agree, any kid younger than a bright 7 year old could scan the monsters in but would not be good at understanding the battles, etc. Still, it's a fun gadget."
4,Scannerz Toy,"My son's friend had one of these toys, thus began the search for it since the stores have stopped selling them. I think they have been discontinued by the maker.Still he has enjoyed it and he loves to go to the store with me now because he can scan all the bar codes he wants. No real educational value unless they want to grow up and work at a grocery store.My son is 9 and it might be hard for some younger kids to use this toy."
1,don't get a commander,"I bought this ( not on amazon) because I already have the blue skannerz( Zendra). But it( the commander) doesn't have very good gameplay. First, if you loose, you loose one of your monsters. Second, to attack or defend you have to stop a timer on THE EXACT NUMBER, it needs which if I ever stopped it on the right # it was pure luck. Don't buy this. If you are going to get a skannerz, get one of the originals( blue, zendra; red, ujalu; green, pataak). One more thing, original skannerz can't battle commanders."
1,A lot of fun while they work but a word of caution-,"My 9 1/2 yr. son received a second one for Christmas. His first one was a lot of fun until one of the buttons jammed and it quit working. This new one did not even last past Christmas morning before becoming jammed. Now it does not work either.I am very disappointed in this product. When it works, it is a lot of fun for kids. Problem is, it is not durable for use by a careful child and won't last a second in younger, less experienced hands. It also is difficult for yonger ones to make the scanner read bar codes. Younger ones will have more fun helping you scan in the self check out.I will not be buying another one of these and do not recommend this at all. There are better values for $20.00"
2,lousy toy,This toy is rather unfair because if you lose a battle you lose your most powerful monster. Don`t waste your time and money on this toy.
2,one srew,I just got this today and it seems pretty good only one promlemI haven`t used it yet. you see I`m having trouble puttingthe batteries in eventualy my dad will fix it and I look foreward to acualy playing with it.
3,Deja vu,"I agree with one of the reviewers - this has strains of Rebecca but obviously is nowhere as good as the original. The characters are not well developed and the mystery is unsatisfying. There is a feeling of incompleteness after reading this shorter Howatch novel. However it is fairly well written and the romance between the young, inexperienced Sarah, her husband Jon and the mysterious Marijohn are enough to keep you occupied."
4,Worth reading,"A detective story, close to the ""How done it?"" genre. Most of te time it keeps the reader suspense, although most of the time it gets to imaginary. Certainly, this isn't a ""must have"" book, but a light and nice book..."
5,"ABSOULTE MUST HAVE SHOW, i know- i was there","i have seen pj a number of times and this is without question the best show i have ever seen and easily in the top 3 i have ever heard. it has it all. strong set list. high energy. endurance..this show was a marathon and i was exhausted when it was over. one word ""release"" to start it off and the rest was history. it would have been the perfect set list in my book if mankind would of been replaced with ""you are"" or some other rarity like ""rats"" which wasn't played at all this tour. rumor has it a dvd of this show will come out, one can only hope.."
4,This was a great show!!!,"I was fortunate enough to be at this show and have great seats (Thanks 10C !) This show has a great set list and while it may not be a mistake free show, this 3 CD set represents a great spirit of fun and spontaneity by the band and you can easily tell that the band is enjoying themselves immensely. There are a couple of nice improv's throw in and the first appearance of ""Breath"" in concert in a real long time. The ""Crazy Mary"" jam between Boom and Mike was magnificent and the ""Fortunate Son"", ""Rocking In The Free World"" and ""Yellow Ledbetter"" ending capped off a memorable show. This was a truly magnificent evening and this set captures how much fun it is being a Pearl Jam fan."
5,Her Best Work!!,"I must admit, it took me a while to finally realize that I was a fan of Macy's...I own ""On How Life Is"" and ""The ID""...but was reluctant to get this album because I didnt really enjoy ""The ID"" as much as her debut...after listening to it, I cannot justify waiting so long...its a great album, she totally redeemed herself with this album...very reto/modern/progressive, all at the same time....I love it...has anyone else noticed that ""My Fondest Childhood Memories"" sounds an awful lot like something from Cher's ""Dark Lady"" ""Gypsies, Tramps and Theives"" days???? Get this album!!"
5,GOD Bless Macy Gray,"Honesty and integrity IS Macy Gray. I love this album! If your having a party, play this disc, if your relaxing, play this disc, if your romancing, play this disc, if your reflecting on life, play this disc. ""Jesus for a day"" is one of my favorite tracks. Love U Macy."
3,Great singer needs songs,"Nearly every stupid movie a few years ago used ""I Try"" in its ads and trailers. The singer totally ruled, and so did the song. The girl needs more good songs. Most of the ist album, The Id, and now this -- nice, if not totally energetic band and arrangements, great Macy singing, but not much in the way of melodies, lyrics, creativity in the songs. Her songs with Fatboy Slim and on 8 Mile were better. Macy, all kinds of people would love to write you songs. Reach out."
2,hit&Miss,while Macy Gray had a Interesting Vocal Presentation it's always been about Her Band&overall presentation that has made Her interesting but the last album&this Album have continued a Downward Spiral that shows no signs of ever gaining a return or I should say match her Live on Stage Pressence.She has alot of Hit&Miss Moments on this set&She on certain spots on this set is trying to seek out past Success but there really isn't a knock out or catchy track that can return Her.the Album title says it all because She hasn't truly found Her Musical Idenity fully.
3,The trouble with Being Myself,"Overall, I thought the disc was a decent effort. When I buy music, I like to know that I can let the entire disc play. For me, there are really only two songs I love. They are Happiness and Speechless. The rest of the disc I like. I wish Macy Gray had stay with the theme she use on Happiness and Speechless. After all, the music and lyrics on these two songs are the Macy Gray I know and love!"
1,i know what the trouble is,"she sounds awful.if ever her,bob dylan and tom waits get together,they can make the all time comedy cd."
1,dont buy this cd,this cd is so bad hilary duff is better then macy gray dony never buy this boring cd it is not good one bet i dont like any song me in my mom had to return this cd but then i tould my mom that i was going to give to my dog this cd is not good
1,the real trouble,"""the trouble with being myself is that I'm too embarassed to admit that I swallowed a frog and my record execs are pimpin' me to put out mess despite my suffering vocal skills""-Macy Gray"
4,Adorable,"Although this album isn't really a departure for Ms. Gray, I don't think that's a bad thing at all. TTWBM is just as exuberant, funky, and soulful as her previous two albums, and she's tinkered with the sound only slightly. Musically, it seems to have more spacey electronic sounds thrown in to spice up the more traditional R&B production. Lyrically, she's on pretty familiar territory, exploring her spirituality and sexuality with a healthy dose of humor. ""When I See You"" is an funky ode to fighting just to make up, ""Come Together"" explores our society's attempts at unity after tragic recent events, ""My Fondest Childhood Memories"" is Macy's THIRD song about a murder fantasy, and ""Screamin'"" is about finding relief in sexual ecstacy. How can you resist someone so original, talented and adorable?"
2,The Trouble With Producing Yourself,"Macy's first disk was a fresh, funky mess. The second was a funky mess. This one drops the adjectives altogether. The melodies feel second-hand, and the only interesting musical moment comes when she snitches a rhythm track from Kraftwerk (those funky homosapiens!). She also snitches a song title from the Beatles and constructs some sort of ambivalent reaction to the war around it that ends up being as muddled as everything here. The much-discussed ""Childhood Memories"" is nothing more than a novelty song; and the novelty that is Macy's croak really wears thin on this, to the point where the shrill ""Sreamin'"" is unlistenable. She looks fabulous in the cover photos, though."
3,Interesting,"I liked this movie. Its interesting and not predictable. Gabriel Byrne plays an alcoholic father returning to his children after being away 4 years. His wife has recently been killed and he tries to resume his position as head of household. This causes problems for his oldest son who is struggling with guilt over his mother's death, and mixed emotions about having his father back again. Good performances with a non-typical ending."
2,"Had potential, but failed in the last half.","""Empire Records"" star Johnny Whitworth plays a misguided youth in this 1996 Martin Donovan directed family drama. Gabriel Byrne and Nastassja Kinski are good, but the last half is so junky. Sadly, this movie failed."
2,Rev up your Rewind Button,"Sheesh, I never had to hit rewind so many times in my life!!!! If I'm buying this Old Dance video at a very high price, it's obvious that I'm a severe beginner in this style of dance, at a late state... Reviewing the terminology was good and the first few dances it was broken down nicely. She takes each pattern one at a time and starts from the beginning of the dance after each,,, but... once you pass the third dance it's like... Oh gee, let me show you this while I dance it. No more breaking down, no more start from the beginning for each pattern it's like... oh watch me ... this is it ok let's do it to music. And the music, by the way ... ewwww, but ok there might be some copyright issues in putting the actual songs on the tape, but then again... at..., you'd think you were already paying royalties. I'd do the same if I just went to a club and watched them dance it and tried to jump in on the second way around.... I'm very disappointed."
1,Instructional dance too,This a sad example of instructional tools. She was too fast and it was not clear at all. Would not recommend this video to anyone. I am so sorry I wasted my money.
4,Great for beginners,"Ok, so the music is really bad but she gives great instructions on the basic steps for line dancing. I bought this when I first wanted to learn to line dance and even though several of these line dances are not done in this area, I've been able to pick up other dances because of the basics I learned from this video. Pretty Cheesy music but hey, if you really want to learn how to line dance, this is a great way to start!"
1,It's not very good.,"I love to dance and I pick up dances pretty well, but this video has really old line dances that are not even played in country clubs. Christy Lane also doesn't explain how to do the dances at all, so, I wouldn't recommend buying this video."
1,still dont get it,"i have requested twice this item, but it has never arrived to me, despite i have been charged"
2,"Get to the point, please.","While this book had many fascinating points, especially the psychological effects of deception, there was way too much discussion of unrelated details, such as the ""bare-ass naked cook"" rollerskating. Gerard could have made the book half this length, including only details of the missions and a brief history, not 150 pages outlining eachn soldier's personal backround and if the ate steak rare or well-done. Overall interseting, but absolutely not a page turner. Only about 50% of the book is truly worth reading, the rest is irrelevant and boring."
2,Disappointing that there was so little deception and so much,"I was expecting a book concentrating on how the military cleverly used deception (camoflage, sound effects, props and acting) during the war. What I got was too much a story of how bad the war was (the war was bad, being a soldier was bad, the officers were bad... ). While it's important to remember the horror of war that is for a different book, even if the horrors are displayed in the form of personal recollections. I accept the set up where the nature of the soldiers in this special unit was explained, but towards the end it really dragged as it carried on long after the end of the units active participation in the war.Needed more focus on the use and effectiveness of deception at war and less on inidividual's recollections of unrelated events."
5,Awesome toy!,This one is great!In my opinion it the best armada toy in the whole line!It is even better than Jetfire in my opinion!But I hate those missles cuz they always seem to pop out when you transform him.Overall I think the japinese version is better because its colors arent so off and it has lights and sounds.But trust me this one is awesome to!Anyway I give this toy an A+.Highly recommended.Okay one last thing.............BUY IT!You wont be dissapointed!
4,Transformer,"My son loves this toy. He says it's a must have when playing with Transformers. It was $140, way too much but since it was a Christmas present I splurged. There have been zero complaints about it from my son."
5,Priceless and ageless,"What I don't understand about these other reviews is that none of them are from after 2004. I have been using this calendar since the day I bought it, and let me tell you, it gets better every year. It keeps track of my days and dates like a charm. I haven't been able to hold a job for 7 years because they say I don't show up on the right days (ridiculous, if you ask me, they need to check their pocket calculators or whatever it is those people use to tell them time), but why have a job when Paige Davis can tell you what day it is for the rest of your life. She's also a stunning fashionista; that haircut will never go out of style.I wish I could give this calendar a review with as many stars as the years I will use it, but Amazon doesn't let you rate things to infinity."
4,No Ty :(,"The calendar is great, but Ty isn't in it. That makes me wonder if he'll be on next season or not. Otherwise, it's a fun, colorful calendar spotlighting some great rooms. There's not that much info, but it's only a calendar. If you want more, buy one of the great TS books."
1,Yuck,"Horrible product. I love this company and their other shampoos, but NOT this item. Does nothing to condition and scent is off-putting. It's VERY possible I received an old bottle, because this smelled like stale dog shampoo.I recommend AURA PURE shampoo/conditioner which smells like Aveda's (now discontinued) popular Chakra III Equipoise perfume.Seller was great, by the way."
1,Shame on Amazon...,"...for continuing to sell these wretched ""General Books LLC"" editions. For those who don't know, these are optically scanned uncorrected (in other words, riddled with errors, sometimes to the point of unreadability) OCR editions of books that are available online at no cost in much more readable pdf. To make matters worse, they usually cost more than pefectly good typeset real books. Don't waste your time or money on this dreck. Why, Amazon, why?"
5,Unbelievably obscure,"This is one of my top 5 jazz CDs. I can't believe it is out-of-print. I have alot of jazz piano trio recordings, and the usual favorites (Oscar Peterson, Bill Evans, etc.), but I'm amazed that Walter Norris, and this performance in particular, isn't as well known. His invention matches the other two, and his technique approaches OP's. I downloaded this on a whim, having seen guitarist Billy Bean's name in an article (and being a guitarist myself), and was stunned at his tone, phrasing, note selection, and technique as well. In fact, the low-key member of the group (though no less talented) is the leader Hal Gaylor, whose bass solos are reminiscent of Ray Brown or Sam Jones. It's hard even to find information on these gentlemen, much less the recordings (I understand that Billy Bean retired from the music scene soon after these sessions). Grab this while you can - thankfully, Amazon has this as a downloadable CD. High praise to Amazon for making this available!"
3,*Sigh*,"Well, the art is wonderful! The author is a great writer, and illustrator, but let me tell you why it was kind of bad.I haven't actually read THIS comic, but I've read another Inu-Yasha comic, and it is very bad. It actually shows a from the head down to the stomach. I started reading it, loving it, then I realized it was not good for people my age, and I was VERY dissapointed. I am sorry."
4,Jane Austen's works are timeless,"Combining all six novels into one volume, gives the reader easy access to all of Jane Austen's work. My favorite of these books is Pride and Predjudice. It is filled with subtle humor and a very good plot."
5,Timeless,"Jane Austen's novel, Pride and Prejudice is, through written long ago, a timeless tale of truth and human beings. It is a truly comical story, with an uncomical moral as genuine and universal as it was when in the eighteenth century. It's characters shall always remain among the most beloved in literature."
5,Spa in a jar.,This product is nothing short of fabulous! It really does leave your skin moisturized. It's a great alternative to spending the big bucks in the spa without sacrificing quality and luxury.
1,Not one of her best,"I don't think that this book was as good as McNaught's others. The hero was just cruel and mean to the heroine all through out the book. You don't see any warmth from the hero until towards the end of the book, which by then seems impossible that the heroine and the hero would be together forever. I'm not sure why others thought this book was romantic. I thought that the two characters were always arguing or that the hero was being cruel to the herione. I'd suggest reading Until You instead."
5,Great read!,This was my first Judith McNaught novel and won't be my last! Great characters! Both hero and heroine have great depth. I love historical ficton. Once and Always was a delight!A book you will not be able to put down so have those dishes done before you start.
5,One of the BEST!!!!,Once and Always definetly has to be one of the best books I have ever read. Anyone who likes historical romance set in England with wonderful characters should pick this book up. I've read several of McNaught's historicals and I really think this one beats them all. READ IT!!!!!
1,Pointless and boring,"This story was so boring. It's the same old stuff, man has a tormented past and can't treat anyone humanly... I was looking for romance, not a disgusting rape scene. Also it totally bothered me that Ms. McNaught would call another race as ""dirty Indians"" or that ""Indians are barbarians who don't object to that kind of cruelty"". Really you know first hand. What a bigot!! I'll be sticking to classier writers like Susan Elizabeth Phillips or Nan Ryan!!"
4,Enjoyable but it has some issue,"I liked this book but there were so many things that had me starching my head. I did not understand why Victoria would fall in love with Jason. He was a total ASS! He is cruel and basically treats her like crap with insulting comments. Now I kind of liked Jason. Once you got to know is story it explained his character. It did not explain why someone would fall in love with him. Victoria is weak; there are no other words to describe her. She comes from America and she is suppose to be fiery. instead she is pushed around by Jason and her ""Uncle"" Charles.Another problem I had with this book is the sex. I'm all for couples having their problems (inexperience or whatever) so that they can work on it. But I don't want to read about a woman almost being raped.Also I think that there were to many misunderstandings in this book and we did not get enough romance."
2,Heartbreaking... --SPOILER ALERT--,"Romance Reader (Post: September 15, 2006 ),I agree with you wholeheartedly; I did not like the way this was done. Jason was indeed a difficult man to like due to his treatment of Victoria. It was disheartening that Victoria put up with it. Also, the story took a light attitude about a heinous deception that was instrumental in denying a love match between Andrew and Victoria. I didn't particularly care how others involved themselves in Victoria's personal relationships as if they had the right to determine her destiny. Then the novel ends on a happily ever after note but this wasn't the case, not for everyone. A good man (Andrew) had to leave England and return home to America without the woman he knew and loved most of his life because of the interference and deviousness of others :( The whole thing just left a bad taste in my mouth."
5,"A positive, appreciative view of Once and always","Although I've read all of McNaught's books, I find this one by far one of her best. If you're like me, and enjoy story lines that contain an intense, passionate relationship with not only a strong male character but also a strong female character, then you'll fall inlove with this book the way I did. It's one of her earlier books, and in my opinion one of her most romantic, due to the fact that she focuses in on the relationship more then outside factors like other romance writers tend to do. No, you won't find a murder mystery here, but instead a lovely, intense, sweeping romance. I know, because every time I flip through those pages, I get a tight knot in my stomach and I choke up; thats the sign of a true romance writer. Read this book!"
3,I love McNaught but this one just isn't my favorite....,"I agree with most of the reviews about this book. It is so much darker and I had a hard time letting go of the depressing feelings even after the book ended. The end when he believes her to be dead (I won't ruin it for you) was such a poignant moment that it almost moved this book up to 4 stars instead of 3.I enjoyed the story and the characters but I knew I probably wouldn't read it again so I turned it into the used bookstore (something I haven't done with any other McNaught book). I would still recommend this book over a lot of authors' best works, though."
4,Once & Always,"This title speaks for all of Judith McNaught's works, once you start reading her books, you will always look for more. It was the first book I read by Ms. McNaught and I wasn't disappointed. Even though it wasn't as fast paced as her other novels, it was good too. Victoria has a strong character and is a great heroine. Jason is also great. You can get an update of their lives in UNTIL YOU."
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL REGENCY ERA READERS,"This was not the first book of McNaught's I read but the third. I was instantly in love with her main characters. No missish weak willed heroine here! I just can't decide if this one or Almost Heaven is my favorite. All of her regency books are great, but I think this one is on the top of the cake! Victoria grew up a strong sensible no nonsense gal. Proud of her upbringing she set anyone on their ear if they speak against her. And Jason the stony hard headed man who at times you want to bash and then you see the protective endearing side of him that makes you fall in love with him. I really love the fact that McNaught doesn't use violence to prove the heroine needs the hero. Her characters are charming full of wit and you can literally feel the personalities as you read her books. No ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" reading here. Very, very lively storytelling."
5,Captivating- A Must Read,"This book has strong, dinamic characters who experience a wide range of emotions. You will laugh, yell, and cry right along with Tory and Jason. By the end of the book you will be in love with Jason and will want to be Victoria. An excellent read."
2,a big disappointment!!,"after reading 'Whitney, My Love' and 'Almost Heaven', i thought this one will have the same excitment as the other two have but i was so disappointed in this story. it doesn't have any warmth and love to it. Jason shows no love feelings or emotions until the last minute, which was impossible to believe. Victoria is not as strong as Ms.McNaught's other heroines. she tries too hard to please Jason. the storyline was not as intense as the other ones. the dialogues were not heart pumping speeches. there's no humor or laughter in this story. this is NOT one of Ms.McNaught's good book. i don't recommend to anyone else!!!"
1,Just Plain Awful,"To make this short and sweet: I hated Once And Always. The hero was just plain mean and paranoid, the heroine was practically groveling at the hero's feet for affection and there were too many misunderstandings based on the stupidest things. I agreed with one particular reviewer, the only character who was likeable was the heroine's ex-fiance, and he got tossed aside for the cruel, emotionally screwed up hero."
2,Didn't care for this one......,"I usually like Judith McNaught and fully expect that the big misunderstanding will occur which has us biting our nails but this one was too much for me. Jason was a jerk! I know once you found out about his story, there was some sympathy there but not enough. I liked Tory even though she was way too understanding of Jason....especially after the wedding night. I also didn't like that he saw his mistress after the wedding even though he 'loved' her then. I just couldn't get past his treatment, even if it was accepted for the time period. I was actually hoping for Andrew to come to England and take her away and I was so sad that she didn't go back with him. In a romance novel I don't like disliking the 'hero' but couldn't help it on this one. I will read her other books but this one was not a keeper in my eyes."
2,Not my thing,OK this story has so much to offer but the hero was an absolute jerk and I have NO IDEA why she stayed with the guy. I mean the guy was nasty to her....I also don't like it when a guy in LOVE will go and fool with his mistress. Just doesn't do it for me. If your a McNaught fan I'm sure you'll like it but otherwise I could have done without.
5,Right up there in the same class as WML and Until You,"Until You STILL remains my favorite McNaught novel, however this will not disappoint you. Truly an entertaining read. I put it third behind Whitney My Love and Until You, better than Kindgdom of Dreams. The only element I didn't approve of was Jason visiting his mistress after they were married...more disgusting than their wedding night, but I guess essential to the development of the storyline. Overall, it is one of McNaught's better writings and you shouldn't miss out on it."
4,Enjoy this one!!!!,"I got this book by accident and was glad I did. It was abused and battered, the cover hanging on by a thread. Obviously well read, I picked it up figuring someone in the past must have loved this book for it to be in this condition. From the first chapter I found that I was captured into the story. So rarely today do we see such a complex structuring of the characters and their story. This is Jason and Victoria's story; there is no murderer to be found, no waif to be saved, no wrong to be righted (inless you count an interfering grandmother) just the indepth growth of a relationship.We all make mistakes in relationships, misjudge people, assume motives, and mistakenly hurt them. It is the relationship that can survive this, that thrives. What a poignant moral for a story. Although the copy of my book was printed in 1987, see if you can pick this story up, its worth the read!"
1,I'm with the other bad reviews...(spolier alert),"Yes - between all the ""misunderstandings"" and date rape behavior - who needs this book. The first kiss was rough & punishing - as was the wedding night.The hero is hard to like at all. I wish she had left with Andrew.I also wish so many romance novels did not promote date rape behavior (e.g., she fights the kiss initially & then caves)."
3,Like So Many Others,I found this book slow moving and repetitive. The characters were not likeable and one note. It was difficult to see what connected them. Their relationship felt like quite a stretch and hard to believe. I found this relationship and some of the scenes more abusive than Whitney my love yet I didn't read of any outcries when I was looking into this book. A forgettable novel that I am glad to be finished with.
4,"What a gentleman! Sweet, lovely story...","This novel was really breathtaking. I love the way Tory (the heroine) was determined to make Jason happy. She certainly wasn't the typical heroine we always read about. Throughout the story, it was so sweet how Jason slowly opened up to her. What can i say but he's very sweet and ""gentle"". I gave it a four star because I thought a certain ""key"" character's presence in one of the scene was very short. It left me saying, ""That's it?"" It didn't bother me THAT much but I also thought the ending was quite rushed. It could've atleast filled up one more page ..then I would've given it a happy full thumbs up! But in any case, it was a lovely lovely story!"
5,Simply Spellbinding!,"Where do I even begin? I have read all of McNaught's works a million times over but Once and Always holds a special place in my heart. McNaught is a GENIUS when it comes to storytelling. I love the complex, deep and passionate characters in this novel. The book is incredibly witty, clever and emotional. It will leave you smiling, laughing and crying within seconds of one another. If you haven't read any of her other works, I strongly recommend you do - they're simply spellbinding."
5,One of my favorites,"This is one of my favorites of Judith McNaught. None of the characters are perfect, they are human. That makes the story better for me."
1,rape scene equals bad (spoilers ahead!),"Ok, I know that the male heroes in Judith McNaught's novels are brooding and dark, with deep secrets that explain why they are who they are etc. But for me this one took it just a bit too far with the wedding night rape scene. And at the end, when through a series of elaborate misunderstandings the hero realizes the heroine isn't dead, it seems like he wants to beat her senseless for scaring him! Um, this one was just a little too angsty/ravishment fantasy/weird for me. Ms. McNaught, you grossed me out.Interestingly, I read this novel for a class on popular literature, and I was looking forward to reading something fun for class. I was disappointed."
5,poignant...painful,"It enthralls me to the story from start to end. Actually, all Judith Mcnaught books are good.But this is as good as Almost Heaven.JM has contributed to the deterioration of my eyesight. Nonstop reading from morning to night, resting only when I take a bath!"
1,she gets raped twice?! and this is romance?,He rapes her on her wedding night and then feels like a schmuck only because he realizes she was a virgin. Because raping non-virgins is ok?! And then he forces her again later?!no thanks.
2,"Jason was dull, dull, dull-and did I mention dull?","Jason never jumped off page for me like Clayton or Zach. In my mind he was just a dark shadow making the book bleak and dull. I felt sorry for Victoria for marrying this character instead of her childhood sweetheart.Don't get me wrong-Ms. McNaught won me over as a fan with Whitney, my Love and Perfect to name a few of her wonderful novels this one just did not strike my fancy."
1,RACIST. Rapist. Look. I rhymed.,"I know that this book was written a while ago, but that is when I read it. When I was a young Indian woman. Yes. Indian. Born and raised in the US, I already had to deal with the awkward reality of 'one of these things is not like the other' as there weren't many of my ethnicity around, but to read 'dirty indian' in a book such as this had the decided effect of curdling my stomach.I am not a racist. I don't judge for skin color, religion, country of origin, sexual orientation - but I do base my judgements upon how people treat others.Bad form, Judith. This 'dirty indian' was hurt years ago by your verbiage - hurt, but not broken.I just wanted to warn others. This book could make you feel sick if you are Indian like me."
1,"Corn, anyone?",Good grief! How corny can you get? And is Judith McNaught still writing? Because all her books seem to be reprints of reprints.
2,Not Her Best!,"I loved McNaught's Night Whispers and Someone to Watch Over Me, but Once and Always was too predictible, and when I read a book that says to me, ""I can write this!"", something is missing. So, a girl is left alone, moves in with family who arrange a marriage, don't like each other at first--then fall in love, and that's it, except for descriptions about her clothes and jewelry. Think I liked her dog ""Wolf"" the best!Perhaps I got spoiled by Penny Vincenzi books with more detail, challenges, etc."
1,Beware: For DVD-RAM enthusiasts only!,"After spending a few hours getting to know this unit, I boxed it up and took it back to the store for a refund. They say that it takes DVD-R, but what you can do with that format is very limited. Do not buy this expecting that you can use it with the same freedom as a VCR. The unit does not take DVD-RW's, so you can't erase and re-use in that format. It doesn't allow you to create chapters or menus with the DVD-R format -- just a straight, plain old record. No markers (after you finalize the disc), no chapters, no multiple programs, nothing! On the other hand, it allows you to do all that with the DVD-RAM format, but it's not a format that's compatable with other DVD players, so you can't share things with your friends & family because it's got this obscure format that nobody can use! So, unless you're in love with the DVD-RAM format, stay away from this one."
1,WORTHLESS!!!,"I had my unit for several months and I finally took a hammer to it. It is a shame that our government can't protect the consumer from being exploited by companies like Panasonic that make crap like this DVD recorder. It often would ""hang-up"" and impossible to get the discs in or out -- the little door simple would not open. I have spent up to 30 minutes tryng to get it to record on a disc and ended in failure. I have recorded on several occasions long movies only to have the unit crash near the end and have to re-record my program (another 3 hours). It is the most frustrating piece of electronics I have ever owned. It is a rip-off !"
1,Lousy DVD recorder,"I have the earlier DMR E50 and I have just taken the lid off to see if there is anything an engineer can fix in the troublesome peice of expensive kit. Its sort of reassuring to see so many others here who had had EXACTLY the same problems...the machine crashes, locks up, can't recover even by pulling the power out, just because it dosn't like a disc, but then it won't let you get the disc out. It has consumed hours and hours of my time. It will only work with Panasonic discs..nothing else.... but now after 12 months it is just more and more choosy about exactly which disc...indeed it is now no use at all. 400 down the drain, I used to like Panasonic. Don't buy it."
1,Ability to record gets worse and worse,"I bought this recorder to keep movies and shows I had recorded from my Ultimate TV (similar to TIVO). At first it did okay, failing about 25% of the time. It started having a higher and higher failure rate using the same types of discs. I have tried many brands of disc and had the same results. It is especially bad with long recordings over 3 hours. The failure rate now is probably 80-90%. I will not be buying another Panasonic audio/video product."
2,Not Quite Ready for Prime Time,"The machine was easy to set up but did not respond to included remote control, which differed from the manual illustration and instructions. Certain functions were not available on remote. Machine will not work with anything but Panasonic disks which happen to cost 2-6 times most other brands. Since I am planning to transfer literally hundreds of VHS tapes to CD-R, this just did not meet my needs. Finally, no matter which output on the machine I used, it never did show up on the TV except when the VHS was playing a tape through the DVD. So I am returning it and may try the Phillips which, even though it is more expensive, might be more what I want."
3,"Great playback, but will not read DVD-R","This unit does a great job of playback. I have never had a DVD player/recorder and it looks great with store-bought DVD's or the DVD-Ram disc that panasonic supplied. But as another reviewer mentioned, it does not read DVD-R. I used several Maxell DVD-R discs (I don't know why the brand should make any difference) and the player says: NO READ. You must purchase DVD-Ram discs or you won't be able to record anything. I did see that others claim that DVD-R works in their units and the manual says it should, but I had no luck and I wouldn't spend $ 400. if you think you're going to record on DVD-R with this unit. Best of luck. Other than that, it's great. You also must have a THREE JACK (Yellow, White & Red) Output a/v on your TV or you will not be able to record from your TV set. If your TV is more than a couple years old, and it has TWO A/V jacks in the rear of the the set, you will not be able to record from your TV or VCR."
1,Old version,Old copy. There is a new version. Do NOT waste your money!!! Does not work with ABLLS Protocol!!
4,This was for my 7 yr old granddaughter....,"I bought her a beginner Sewing Machine and this was an additional book I thought was cute to get.......its alittle more advanced for her at this time, but will come in handy later on I am sure.......thx."
4,good mystery,Janis Harrison continued with h err excellent writing and keeping you wanting to finish quickly. Great page Turner.and surprising ending
2,"Acting amazing, story twisted and hurt.","Tennessee Williams's play, ""Suddenly Last Summer"", is an incredible drama, but the chages made adapting the play to fild discredit the story and hurt the movie. The acting could not have been better though. There were two nominations for Best actress Oscars in this one film, Katherine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor. They both played twisted characters obsessed with Sebastian Venable. A movie worth seeing just for the acting nad the unbelievable story."
2,"Just say it, already!","Long, slow, New Orleans-in-the-thirties talkfest filled with hystrionics and over-acting. Hepburn is excellent, playing a Southern grande dame with a decidedly New England accent, Taylor is gorgeous (complete with full makeup, tight dresses, and stilettos while incarcerated) and shreiks a lot, while Clift appears catatonic and bug-eyed throughout. McCambridge minces about with a silly, shrill drawl and looks ridiculous.The whole point of the movie is summed up in one sentence, but it takes 113 minutes to get to it.If you like Tennessee Williams' long-winded speeches, you'll love this movie. I didn't."
4,To give away the plot would spoil the fun...,"... but that's exactly what Columbia Pictures does, in the ad copy on the back of the DVD case!If you buy this DVD (which I heartily recommend) but you have NOT seen the film before, DO NOT read the back of the DVD case before watching the movie."
1,bad luck.,the fact that it was a vhs was not prominent. in tiny letters on the back. have a vhs player no longer so had it returned. like the movie but was not informed what form it was on. need to change that. i'm probably not the only one that happens to. did get a refund. not the seller's fault i think.amazon needs to put standards on their third party stuff. have had a lot of bad luck with them. only order from ones i have used and had good luck with.
4,High camp and fresh undertones...,"The acting, the story, the direction, the plotline are amazing. Manciewicz (sic), Hepburn and Williams...you cant go wrong. If you want something majorly camp and cheesier, check out BOOM! Wowee, its like gay candy! enjoy...!"
5,Summer endings...,"What can I say, copy is great, sound and picture clear and the acting all around is wonderful. Great transaction and would buy from seller again! Cheers, William"
5,Suddenly Last Summer,"Very fond of Tennnessee Williams and this plot especially was a ground breaking theme as ti dealt with the vagaries of ""taboo"" subjects like incest and homosexuality and how they were central to the story developement."
5,Classic,"This story is a perfect combination of betrayal and the macabre'. It has facinated me for years since I first saw it in the 60's. I thoroughly enjoy Taylor's portrayal of the victimized heroine, trapped in her memories of the horrifying events of ""last summer"". What an actress! And what can anyone say about Katherie Hepburn? ""Magnificient"" is the word that comes to mind for me. She brilliantly portrays a loving but controlling, jealous mother, enabler, and heartless victimizer on the verge of insanity. This is a movie I'll watch over and over."
1,Give me a break!,"This film is overwrought and silly, much like the play upon which it is based. The effort to avoid having the characters say ""the unspeakable"" leaves you exasperated with Elizabeth Taylor's inarticulate whining and Montgomery Clift's obtuse psychiatrist. The fate met by Sebastian Venable is lurid and absurd. The film is redeemed solely by its historic importance as an exploration of homosexuality in a repressive era and by the chance it offers to see the three principles (Montgomery Clift, Elizabeth Taylor, and Katherine Hepburn) together."
1,DON'T WATCH THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This isn't one of those movies that it takes maturity in age to appreciate and understand. No one, no matter what age is ready for such a gruesome and downright disgusting film that depicts cannibalism. I am a huge fan of Elizabeth Taylor, and when I picked up this movie, I envisioned a sweet beach romance due to the lighthearted-sounding and very misleading title: Suddenly, Last Summer. I couldn't have been more wrong. People are only attracted to this movie because they find it is different (obviously) and therefore feel they should embrace it because of its controversiality. I guess that's what sells these days-the more horrific, the better. Doesn't any one care about morals? Why should people pay to see the lowest animal instinct come out in humans? Leave that in the jungles of Africa. Don't you think we have improved enough as a society since then that we can reflect a better side of life?"
1,NOT CELINE DION-awful!!,"I bought this thinking that it was a compilation of songs sung by Celine Dion.....it is NOT. I was horribly disappointed. No one can re-do a Celine Dion song and do it justice. If you are looking for a good compilation album buy something that is actually sung by Celine!!! DO NOT BUY THIS, you will be disappointed"
2,Disappointing.,"Evan's is one of my favorite authors. I enjoy his books in part due to the setting and great stories. This book was too much soap opera. My least favorite of his books. Read ""The Loop"" instead."
4,"Good, but not his best.","I probably would have liked this book better if I didn't know who the author was. I was expecting, hoping for, a book as good as The Loop or Smoke Jumper. This one wasn't, IMHO. But it was still better than most books that I've read lately."
2,starts out suspensful; ends up ordinary and blaaaah!,"I enjoyed the first chapter of this book, but I felt a little misled when its content took a U-turn after that. The book begins with a father and son making a dangerous trek up an icy mountain during a skiing trip and accidentally finding a frozen,dead body. From there Evans weaves his elaborate story of how the body ends up on the mountain. The story is about how a cheating, middle-aged husband indirectly ruins the lives of his wife, son, and daughter (who is the body that is found on the icy mountain). By the end of the book, everyone has adjusted to being ""dumped on"" by the guilt-ridden husband's decision to leave the family, and they have no choice but to move on with their lives. This is nothing more than another classic story of immoral misbehavior involving a weak male character who can't improve his marriage and takes the easy way out by leaving."
3,great scenery.....,"Nicholas Evans has the wonderful ability to truely give charecter to landscape. In all of his books my favorite characters have been land in which the story takes place in and this one was no different.I enjoyed Abby's story and felt that she had the most depth of all the the characters. I also appreciated that Evans brought to light some of the environmental damage that is being done in some of our most beautiful areas, and how the land owners are most of the time completely unable to stop it from happening.On the other hand, I did not care in the least about the parents divorce and found the mother to be extemely unlikeable. Romance is not my cup of tea but always find Nicholas Evans to be a good read."
3,Good Story,"This was a good story but I thought it was too lengthy in the middle of the book with ongoing issues that I wasn't too interested in such as the environmental issues, etc. The beginning was good but it kind of fizzled out for me in the middle and end. Not a bad book though."
3,A jolly good read without being a prize winner,"This was a novel that started with the conclusion and then led the reader through the preceeding facts, so the reader was never left with anynotion that there would be a happy ending. It was the story of a somewhat over-indulged teenager whose actions brought great sadness to those around her due to her focus on what she wanted, to the disregard of her family and real friends. Those who have had teenagers will relate to the frustrations felt by her parents and sympathise with their despair as the tradegy unfolds, although the self-absorbed behaviour of the girl's father can seen to be a contributing factor to the disaster.Overall I found this good reading, a book that kept me entranced so that I read well into the night, but lacking the finesse in the development of some of the characters to make it a prize winner. But I would certainly recommend it to others."
2,First half is worth it,"I found the first half of this book to be extremlely interesting and compelling. The second half; however, is boring and cliched. It only succeeded in making me angry. Abbie is the spoiled child of rich parents who engages in acts of terrorism, but never has to face the consequencese. Even when she is throwing tantrums and putting her loved ones in jail, no one ever calls her on it. I know this is supposed to be fiction, but it felt much too contrived and was very unconvincing."
3,Strong Start But Falters,"This is the first book by Nicholas Evans I have read. While the book starts strong, it falters badly as the story goes on. The character of Abbie, the daughter, is the least believable. The author does not show WHY Abbie takes up with Rolf (the ecoterrorist), remains with him, why she does not just leave him, and why she telephones him after she finally does leave. Abbie is a wealthy, educated woman, it is unbelievable that she would stay with Rolf. Evans also does not show in any way HOW Rolf found out where Abbie was; writing ""we'll never know how he found her"" is not satisfactory - deux ex machina works in Greek tragedies, not in contemporary novels. This novel is so interesting at the beginning - I really wanted to know about these characters and hear their stories. It is sad that the author seems to have lost interest and could not be bothered to finish the book with the level of writing the first part of the book shows."
4,A Good Mystery,"To keep you turning the pages, but what I liked the most about this book, and the author in particular, is that his characters are so well developed. Even when the story line strays he makes you follow because you've become so attached to the characters by the time it takes a wrong turn that you can't put it down."
3,Not Great...Not Terrible,"I generally base my reviews upon whether or not I would pass the book on for my 74-year-old mother to read when I'm done. I'm up in the air on this one. While the story is interesting enough it seems like it took me forever to finish this book. It drones on and on takes a while to pick up, which it does the last quarter of the book. The characters are all kind of pathetic and unrealistic. I find Abbie's behavior completely unbelievable...no daugher of priviledge would let the situation get as out of hand as she does. We never hear what happens to Sarah's parents who play a somewhat prominent role during the first half of the book. I don't know...this book left me feeling kind of blah. My advice is to read it if someone gives it to you or you can pick it up at the library but don't waste your hard-earned money on it."
2,disappointed,"Of the 4 of Evans' books, this is the most disappointing - it lacks the power of his first book, Horse Whisperer and the intensity of The Loop. The premise is promising but then lapses into the story of Abbie's parents, Ben and Sarah's divorce, which is written in mind numbing detail. The book could be half the number of pages were we not subjected to such distracting detail."
5,A Fabulous Story!,"I absolutely loved this book! What a wonderful story of love, betrayal, a child gone wrong, and family relationships. The characters and the setting seemed so real. I just felt so much a part of the happenings that I hated to finish, because then I would have to leave this ""world"" created by the author's words. I will be sure to recommend this book to all of my fellow readers."
1,awful,"I thought this book was truly awful. I read the first chapter and then put it down for many months, finding it dull. I later decided to finish it. I found it lacking any creativity or much relevance. Start with a body then tell the ho-hum story of how it got there. No suspense, not particularly interesting characters, and a really dull tragedy. Teen girl gets mixed up with dangerous ecoterrorist guy and winds up dead. It didn't need a book, but I guess when you're a bestselling author you don't need to come up with good stories or themes anymore. Watch any episode of Bones for a better take on this formula and save yourself a lot of hours."
4,Superb but.....,"Divide is the fourth book by Nicholas Evans. While Divide is superbly written it lacks the poetic rythms of Horse Whisperer, the intensity of the Loop and the power of Smoke Jumper.Abbie Cooper, a young woman from an affluent family is sought for murder. When she unexpectedly and tragically turns up dead the reader is thrown into an emotional spiral downward. What could have caused a woman with so much potential to stray to society's fringe? And who would want her dead? The hidden fractures of Abbies family are laid bare for the reader. It isn't a pretty sight.Evans always supplies the reader with vivid characters and straightforward plots. He does so in Divide.I do believe that Divide is Evans weakest novel yet, but well worth reading and certainly a lot better than some of the other slop that is out there."
1,Nothing happy in this book at all,No characters that I liked. Nothing happy happened. And I came away depressed and feeling like I wasted my money.
1,"I kept waiting for a plot, or something interesting....","But nothing ever caught my interest. I felt NOTHING for the characters which can sometimes help to carry a dull plot but Evans gave me primarily one-dimensional self-involved bores. The writing was plodding and tiresome. Senseless descriptions galore. I had to force myself to finish reading it and for the first time, in self defense, I ""skimmed"" to find the parts that actually carried the story line so I could at last be done with it. I'll never trust professonal reviews on book covers again. I gave it at least one star for the cover art."
1,MINUS FOUR STARS---AT LEAST!!!,"AFTER THE FIRST TWENTY PAGES OR SO, I THOUGHT YAHOO, THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD.YYYEEE-OW!!! WENT DOWN HILL RRRR EEE AAA LLL FAST---REAL FAST---THAT WAS THE ONLYTHING THAT WAS GOING FAST---THE BOOK PLODS ALONG---SLOWLY. I HAD TO STOP EVERY ?? 50 ??PAGES TO WRITE A NOTE IN THE MARGIN AS I READ. AFTER THE START---WHERE DID THE STORY GO---WHERE IS THE DEAD GIRL?? WHERE IS THE SHERRIF??? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BIRTHDAY SADDLE---IKNOW--IT IS NOT IMPORTANT--BUT DID THE SADDLE SHOW UP??I FINALLY PULLED THE PLUG ON PAGE 344---RIGHT AFTER SARAH / BENJAMIN DECIDE TO HAVE A LITTLEROMP IN THE HAY FOR OLD TIMES SAKE. HE HAS LEFT HIS FAMILY---HIS DAUGHTER IS WANTED BY THE FBIFOR MURDER / ACCOMPLICE TO---AND THEY FIGURE THEY'LL JUST FOOL AROUND ?? ONCE ?? MORE.OKAY---MY BOTTOM LINE IS----WHERE DID THE AUTHOR OF """"THE HORSE WHIPERER"""" (GREAT BOOK) AND""""THE LOOP"""" (GREAT BOOK)---GO??? IT SURELY WASN'T HERE."
4,The Divide by Nicholas Evans,One of my favorite books ever is The Horse Whisperer by Nicholas Evans. I purchased The Divide because of the same author. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend to others; The Horse Whisperer is still my favorite!The Horse Whisperer
5,Evan's best book,This story was Nicholas Evan's best. Don't let any negative review stop you from reading this book. It is true that their are a few chapters were Evan's describes a lot and slows things down but it just gets better and better as you get to the end.
4,Ice maiden,"The body of a young woman is found, embedded in ice, on a mountain in Montana. Her body is easily identified as that of Abbie Cooper, the daughter of a comfortably off family, who was caught up romantically with an eco terrorist who involved her in the murder of an innocent victim. Wanted by the police and hunted by the FBI, she was estranged from her family and lived, in a similar situation as Patty Hearst, on the streets in squats, in filth and poverty, but still in thrall to her ruthless and non caring lover. Just prior to Abbie separating from her family, they were torn apart by her father, Ben, leaving her mother, Sarah, for another woman, after twenty years of marriage. This situation drives an insurmountable wedge between father and daughter and causes Sarah to accuse Ben of being the cause of Abbie's death, whether it was accidental or murder. It's a good read which skips backwards and forwards between time zones and delves deeply into the inner secrets of a family in trouble."
4,Very decent read,"I just finished this book this morning. It was an enjoyable read and I was quite hooked. There was mystery and romance, and I think it could appeal to either sex, young or older. I found that it slacked off a bit toward the end, however. The well-thought out details of the beginning seemed quickly wrapped up toward the end, sometimes a little bit unsatisfactorily so. All in all, I am glad that I read the book."
5,"A grab bag? Maybe, but classical music nevertheless","Not an album of Ellington's music, this compilation of Peterson's unique interpretations will nevertheless please all fans of mainstream and swing;hardcore Peterson fans will probably go for widely available albums by this exciting pianist, but this CD will give a lot of pleasure to all the rest.It can also serve as an fine introduction to Peterson's work - we can hear him playing solo, in small rhythmic ensembles, with happy horns of Clark Terry and Dizzy Gillespie and, last but by no means least, as a special guest on a Duke Ellington orchestra concert.Great album; admittedly a sort of grab bag many companies compile to cash in on their artists, but that does not diminish listening pleasure..."
4,yeah its good,it does what it needs to do. the big end is slightly to big though. so be warned. but its all good
5,A 'Must-Have' for Sarah Vaughan Fans!,"Very good quality audio and video, for the most part. It's such a treat to see such extended video of Sarah and her trios doing their thing during the earlier part of her career. A must-have for Sarah Vaughan fans."
1,I wanted to like this....,"Weak sillage. I purchased the souffle and scrub (very $) and thought that maybe if I invested in the spray it would help the scent last. I was very disappointed as the scent lingered on me about 15 minutes. I do Ike the souffle, but it's light as well."
5,Works Perfect,"I have had this FreezeAlarm for about 6 months now. It was relativly easy to program. I set it in my house in South Dakota late December and went to Arizona for the winter. We were gone 4 months, the device called me twice when the furnace did not light, and once during an electrical outage. All three times I was able to get a repairman to the house before anything froze and caused any damage, it has already saved me thousands of dollars in repair bills. While I am away for the winter, I can call my home phone anytime, from anywhere and the device will tell me the current temparature in my home. One of the best devices I have ever bought."
5,Great product,Great Product! I had heard of similar products but most require monitoring fees or are more complex. The FreezeAlarm was not only simple to use but it payed for itself immediately when it called our home in Florida due to a furnace outage in our Minnesota home. My wife also really likes the fact that we can call our home and check the temp and power anytime.
4,Very Satisfied,We haven't had an alarm yet but it certainly was easy to set up and test! So far we are very satisfied!
5,Control Products FA-I-CCA Intermediate Freeze Alarm,"Set up was very easy. Freeze Alarm called our 3 numbers and it was easy to access the information to make sure the temperature was accurate in the house. So far, so good!"
5,Great Monitor,Product gave me peace of mind throughout the winter. It called me twice when there was a power failure... wish I had purchased it earlier...
1,Freezer Alarm,"The unit worked as it was designed. The problem I had with it was when I was considing buying it the description was misleading in what kind of alarm it is. It does not have an audible alarm buzzer which is the main item I wanted for our home freezer and I wanted one that ran on electricity instead of a battery, which that part it did have. The only way you know this alarm is going off, even if you are standing next to it, is by it dialing a telephone number that you preprogram into it. This alarm would be fine if you wanted to monitor a temperature at a long distance location. For the high price I paid for it I would think the company could include an audible alarm buzzer. Instead they offer what they call a ""more advanced version"" for double the price which has an audible buzzer, model TA-900. I did return the unit and was refunded properly."
1,It does not work!,I purchased 2 of this products for my home before I took an oversea trip. I set it up but it did not work as I thought.
1,Could not make it work,"The unit was delivered quickly and easy to set up however I could not get the unit to answer the phone to receive an alarm cancellation call. I called technical support and spoke to a very nice gentleman would could not figure out what the problem might be. He indicated that he would speak to the engineers and get back to me, which he never did. I don't know if it was a problem with my phone (a regular POTS line with DSL) but after not hearing back from support, I returned it and purchased a Sensaphone 400, which is more than double the price but much more flexible and offers more alarm features."
4,Does the job,"We bought it for travelling and it is easy to set up, use, and check remotely. I also tested it before our trip. It does what it say it wiil do."
4,Easy set up,Using the product as I write the review. A friend recommended and we decided we liked the idea to have it monitor the home temperatures while we are away.
2,Rife with errors,"Making the transition from flat HTML to PHP/Mysql, this COULD'VE been a great book. However, because of the numerous errors contained in the application scripts, none of them see to work out of the box, and it ends up being more confusing for the novice. I suppose it is good debugging training, but it's a rough way to learn! If anyone ever comes up with an ""Errata"" site or updated scripts, please let me know. The editor/proofreader should be out of a job. Meanwhile, I'm out $30!!"
2,hard to grasp,It seemed as though this book was meant for people that already have a understanding of the foundation of PHP. Basic programming skills are definitely required. The introduction chapter dives you right into some PHP script that I copied verbatim and got an error result. Im returning the book.
3,Good Book,"I liked this book as it gives complete applications which can be deployed within hours, if not minutes, on a live web server."
1,One of my biggest regrets,"I bought this book with the intention of learning PHP. I went into it with a some knowledge of programming, no knowledge of SQL, and a strong background in logic.I very quickly discovered that, rather than a learning guide, what I purchased was the source code for several applications with vague descriptions of how data was being handled.In fairness, I do find what i am looking for about 10% of the time. The other 90% I am either checking the web for source, discussions, or tutorals, or I am using the PHP manual and playing hit and miss.It is my experience that anything this book can offer is freely available from the Web. And that the Web offerings are usually better documented.If you are a beginner, look elsewhere. This book will likely leave you dumbfounded.If you are experienced, look elsewhere. This book will likely bore you to tears."
1,Fatal Errors in every script,"When I began reading this book I was excited because I like the way it explains things. My excitement dwindled when I attempted to install the scripts. I'm no pro when it comes to PHP or MySQL but I do have about 50 other scripts running that use them so I was surprised when I could not get a single script from the CD to work. Every one produces ""Fatal error: Call to undefined function:...""The site that is allegedly associated with the book was of no help. Emails to both authors went without response.The errors could have to do with configuration of the server (or the php.ini file on the server) I am using to test the scripts on...that's just a guess given that some reviewers of this book seem to have had no problem.I wish I had spent the money I wasted on this book on chocolate. It would have taken less time to work off the calories than I expended trying to get these scripts to run."
1,I NEVER RECEIVED THIS ORDER!,RE: MYSQL/PHP DATABASE APPLICATIONS 2ND EDITION BOOKI NEVER RECEIVED THIS ORDER!I DID NOT RECEIVE MY MONEY BACK OR ANY ATTEMPT ON THE PART OF THE SELLER OR AMAZON TO MAKE THIS RIGHT.I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM.
2,Look elsewhere for learning PHP DB programming,"I plain didn't like the layout of the book.The chapter titles weren't very informative. Where would one look when trying to learn the how to connect to a database? I would at least expect a ""hello world"" example of connecting to a database not just a reference listing of the function call under ""PHP's Built-in Functions"".The examples given in the book aren't bad except that there is no mention of the file names so one could look them up on the CD.There has to be better books."
2,Book contains typing errors and not organized,This book is not well organized. Wrox books are better.
2,Too Much Fluff,"I first learned PHP from Luke Welling and Laura Thomson's excellent ""PHP and MySQL Web Development,"" and bought 'MySQL/PHP Database Applications' to provide an alternative perspective on solving problems. Unfortunately, this book doesn't offer enough content to warrant its high price.A full 58 pages is devoted to a PHP function reference which is a bit of a joke because PHP has one of the better online function references available. Code examples are printed with very large font again taking up more space than is necessary.Most important, though, some of these examples are a little bit suspect.They present a Catalog application written using Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This would have been valuable except that the classes they create are so specific that they couldn't be re-used -- basically negating the value of OOP to begin with.They do provide a couple of examples of good and bad relational database schema, but that isn't really worth the cost of this book."
2,It COULD be worse...,"As a general overview, the content of the book is pretty good, and would have been great... but the authors and editors do a VERY poor job of being specific where necessary, verifying that the scripts offered in the text actually run, and explaining the concepts and language constructs before using them. For the beginner, this book would be confusing as all hell, due to the vague descriptions and error filled examples. For the experienced programmer looking to pick up PHP & mySQL skills, the book is pretty much an exercise in debugging and wince-management as the stream of vague descriptions of the topic at hand wash over you, or some language construct is used with no information about it anywhere close."
2,"Not accurately updated, not complete","I agree with the previous reviewer. There is a lot of inaccurate information (phone numbers, prices) and there is much that is not included, as compared with other guides. It does seem that the author has ""heard"" about, rather than experienced first hand, some of the things he includes. For the independent, budget traveller, I would not recommend this book. I just returned from Puerto Rico and used Lonely planet and Let's go PR. Let's go was the best one of the bunch! LP was next best. If you have to choose one, Let's Go would be it. On the other hand, if $$ is not the primary concern, Explore Puerto Rico does include more complete and interesting historical review and details of the environment and makes for a good read for a day at the beach."
5,"Very socially responsible, refreshingly honest",It was a refreshingly honest look at the island and its culture. Rarely does a guide book both respect a place and give you the 'warts and all' assessment of what goes down there and how. Very glad to have bought and read it!
3,"Good detail, but leave out the politics","The book is thorough with a good bit of detail (although some reviewers said some was inaccurate) but this is a travel guide and not a political book. He is aparantly against the military, people with conservative leanings, the Coors family and probably the European explorers. I think if he writes another travel book he needs to leave out the little quips and inuendos."
1,Living the vida musica,"I am Puerto Rican and visit the island as often as I can. Besides seeing family, my favorite thing to do is catch live music. I noticed in this guide by Mr.Pariser that he says bomba is an obscure music that only lower class Puerto Ricans listen to. I like bomba, and I know that bomba, which is African-influenced, is pretty popular these days and getting more serious attention because Puerto Ricans are learning their history and are proud of their roots. A lot of jazz musicians are now using bomba in their work. Hopefully it won't require Ricky Martin to bring it to the attention of a so-called expert on the island like Mr.Pariser."
3,"Good read, but awfully outdated","I enjoyed reading this book, which clearly approaches Puerto Rico as someone who loves it, not just as a tourist. (I knew I'd found a good book when it referred to Dubya as ""Shrub."")But the phone numbers are just appallingly out of date. I called probably twenty or thirty and only one picked up. The book offers free online updates, which is very generous, but not very practical. I bought a guidebook because I'd left my laptop at home. I hope they'll update the book itself soon, as it's a great book, but accurate information is really vital."
5,An excellent travel guide,"A reader Explore Puerto Rico is a typically excellent travel guide of the Caribbean area by this author, who has won an award for his travel writing. As usual, he emphasizes the environmental aspects of the subject region. It is filled with neat factoids of where to get things and what to see. The author crams an incredible amount of useful information into his guides, and this is no exception. We rated it four hearts. -- Heartland Reviews"
4,Healthy and interesting,This book is HIGHLY recommended by my doctor who put me on a low salt diet for vertigo. I've only had a chance to make a few of the recipes. My husband has not yet been enthusiastic about any of the dishes I've made but they were quick and easy and I liked them.
2,Scale is too large to be very helpful,Many roads are completely missing in this ill-conceived New Mexico Atlas. I'm afraid that the idea of having two different map styles for each area reduced the level of detail so much.
2,Benchmark New Mexico Road & Recreation Atlas,"Great contour atlas, easy to find objects of interest. The maps are too redundant and the scale is disappointing (I expected at least twice better)."
5,Lenses on Reading,Needed book for Masters class. Got it quickly on the date promised. It is what it says it easy and not too drawn out.
3,Needs more underwater footage,I would rather see more underwater footage than people talking. They could talk on the soundtrack and give us more images of manatees.
5,In Praise of The Tiny Giants Trilogy,"The Tiny Giants Trilogy is a singular masterpiece. Erik Quisling, with his rich vocabulary and intricate sense of irony, captures the passion, romance, ecstasy, and angst of what it means to be human in this postmodern age through these three highly entertaining and emotionally gripping minimalist sagas. What is truly remarkable is that you will immediately identify with and love the invertebrate heroes of this trilogy because their stories are indeed yours. The Tiny Giants Trilogy is original through and through--from its conception to the mode of its expression. Each line of these beguilingly humorous tales is pregnant with layered meanings and subtle nuances that turn deep complexity into a precious simplicity. The Tiny Giants Trilogy will withstand the test of time and will remain a classic."
5,Excellent Service,"I ordered these seeds right around Christmas and received them 2 days later. Excellent service, well packaged. No fuss. Just what you asked for and right away. Will order again. Check out their site."
4,amply supply of seeds,"I expmect these seeds to produce hundreds of poppy flowers, but it's too soon to know hdow cthey will do. No clue as to whether they will reseed themselves."
1,never did grow,these seeds are horrible they never grow and company does not return money like they d said they would very bad business deal
3,California State Flower,"I like these flowers. I have put in a field before and they drop their own seeds and stay for quite some tme. Someone always takes half to parts unknown however, and this mystery is not interesting.. I have not gotten the blooms from this purchase yet, but the sprouts are healthy and should mate up by the middle of summer."
4,a VERY GOOD Triumph record,"This is very good Triumph record, it deserves a good rating. Too Much Thinking kicks the album off on a good note, the dialogue at the beginning and end of the song is cool sounding. It then moves into A World Of Fantasy which was a good radio song upon it's release. A Miner Prelude / All The Way is one of the stronger tracks on this LP, it Rocks. Battle Cry is probably a underated song on this LP, I feel this is a good song with good lyrics. Overture / Never Surrender is the highpoint of this LP, good lyrics with a positive message, Classic Triumph for sure. When The Lights Go Down is another good tune, it shows what a good band they really are. Writing On The Wall / Epilogue ends this album on a good note. This is not their best effort, but it does have many good moments on it and is better than some of the LP's they released."
4,Underrated even by Triumph fans,"On the heels of the powerhouse LP ""Allied Forces"" many deem this one a disappointment. However, it's hard rocking, versatile, and thought-provoking just like all their other LPs. The slide guitar on ""When The Lights Go Down"" is absolutely incredible, and ""A World Of Fantasy"" is one of Triumph's best songs and appears on their Greatest Hits. ""Too Much Thinking"" is a good stab at identifying with teenagers (or anyone) who is confused with politics and world affairs and is being bombarded with too much media and doubts politicians honesty."
2,ALWAYS SURRENDER,"Always surrender to the fact that Rik Emmet is the only good musician in Triumph. But he can't make this album work only by himself, so the result is disappointing. Its Triumph's worst album."
4,"Packs Punch, Falls Short of Allied Forces","Okay, this album was a good effort, and is a worthy followup to the successful Allied Forces. This album has some memorable cuts such as NEVER SURRENDER, A WORLD OF FANTASY, and BATTLE CRY. WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DOWN isn't one of my favorites, but still rocks hard. I recommend this album for any Triumph fan. If there's one criticism that I have of this great band, it's the fact that they used more than one vocalist; I don't understand the rationale for this approach. Rik has the best pipes, and has a very distinctive voice. It seems as though some of the band's identity is lost when they switch vocalists back and forth. Gil is excellent on vocals, but Rik's work stands out the most and defines their sound. Still, this album gets my respect."
2,Not based in reality,"This book basically describes single women in midlife as uniformly content, financially well-off, healthy, and lovin' it. While I think this may be true for a significant proportion of us, I absolutely know it's not true for all. Considering this book was written by a social worker, it does nothing to address the very real societal and economic problems that affect single, middle-aged women. It's a little too biased and a little too gung-ho."
1,Where is the Full Length Freemasons Club Mix?,"The Freemasons full length club mix of ""Ring The Alarm"" is great, yet it is not included on either the ""Ring The Alarm"" CD single or the ""Irreplaceable"" singles. I don't understand why the label chose only to include the radio edit here, but it made me decide to not purchase the single. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Artists who do not release their material tend to become irrelevant. They are also a great advertisement for illegal downloading."
3,Based on Irreplacable,"I absolutely love the song irreplacable, After Deja Vu it is the best song on the B'Day album. So the three stars are because I love that song so much. I like the song ring the alarm, but not enough to want a million versions of it. Since irreplacable is the title for this short CD then I feel that the ehnaced video should be that of the title song...not ring the alarm. And for that reason I do not give the CD 4 or 5 Stars."
3,A Great Trip Back to the 1980s,"As Neil Diamond said, ""I've never been a man who likes to swear."" Profanity is part of going to the movies, but I'd forgot how much 80s movies swear non-stop. I watched Ferris with my 16 year old daughter and enjoyed it very much. She it was on of those movies she wanted to see because there are so many references to it. Other than the profanity, which was mild, yet constant, it was a fun story."
3,New generation sees Bueller,"My ksid had never seen this movie and so we purchased it while on a flight, they were amused by the movie and thought it was better than what they thought it would be. I think its a classic movie and think it's fun and very memorable."
5,SAVE FERRIS,"This movie defines a generation, my generation. This movie IS the 80's. I have seen it probably a hundred times, and never tire of it. It is very dated, but always witty. You have got to love Matthew Broderick as Ferris Bueller. He is the kid we all wanted to be. Even though he missed 9 days of school, I give Ferris an A+."
5,Save Ferris,"What a fun movie with great actors, they brought together a superbly written story.. It is such a cult classic and will always reign supreme!"
4,It's a classic,A stupidly brilliant piece of work by Matthew Broderick. It is perfect for unwinding and reminiscing about the good old days.
5,"Classic , can Never die!",Matthew Broderick was awesome! Classic like the movie Glory! Funny! you can watch it 5 times a week! great movie! Pick up a copy!
5,buy this movie,This may just be the best movie ever made. I can watch it over and over and still laugh histerically. Buy this movie while you still can.
5,"ONE WORD FOR THIS MOVIE: ""GREAT! ""","I thought this movie was excellent. Made in the early 80's, it still appeals to teens (like me) in the 90's. All the actors did a super job and I was never board or fast-fordwarding through this video. The bottom line is, you haven't lived until you have met Ferris Bueller."
3,Not a bad 80's flick,"I would imagine sales of this Blu Ray wouldn't be that great since TBS and many other cable stations played this movie to death for almost two decades. After watching this 20 years later, I can not believe how small and tight that Red Wings hockey sweater was that Alan Ruck wore. Hockey jerseys aren't suppose to fit like a damn t-shirt geek. He looks like such a jackass wearing that jersey. Then again this guy is the biggest nerd on and off the camera. Is the principal - pedifile still locked up? I hope so. This is a good movie to see once a decade."
1,Disappointed!,"I received this DVD in a timely manner, only it to have been the wrong item (movie). I had ordered Ferris Buellars Day off and received a cartoon video, I emailed the seller rite away to let them of situation and that I wuld be sending item ASAP back to them. They responed a couple days later, stating they wuld gradually refund money, but not send me correct item. So had to reorder my movie! What a waste of time. ):"
1,This movie blew kittens!,Matthew Brodrick plays the worst thing ever: the high school kid that is an idiot and doesn't go to school because he wants to fornicate with his girlfriend. The dog played the best part out of the whole pathetic collection of actors.
3,Ultimate sick-day dvd,"If you're planning a sick-day, and want a movie to watch, then this is the one. Sure it's a bit 'stuck in the '80s', but the themes are all still relevant, and it's straight up funny. You can probably only watch this movie once a year before it comes across as too corny, but if you know what you're expecting wen you put it in the player, then it's great."
5,Great Buy,The movie arrived really quickly (even during the Christmas rush) it was very inexpensive and in the quality that they stated.
5,"a great 80s movie, but STILL great","Yes Amazon is correct. This is a quintessential 80s movie, along with the Breakfast Club, Back to the Future, and Ghostbusters, among others. But high school hasn't changed too much, and the characters in this movie ring true no matter what decade it is. The scenes with Rooney and his secretary, the scenes with Ferris and Cameron, Ferris's monologues to the camera: this is near-timeless comedy, employing time-worn classic character types and scenarios, and a theme any one-time high school kid in America can relate to. This is still the funniest high school movie ever, and one of the most hilarious comedies of the past 30 years."
5,Best Teen Film Ever!,"I just happend to turn on the TV one saturday afternoon and saw this. What more can I say? I bought it shortly after and have seen multiple times since. I recomend it for any one who likes 80s teen flicks. Now I don't exactly agree with the whole teen rebellion thing(I find stuff like that really stupid), but this movie is good for other reasons. Its loaded with memeroble lines. For example-""I'm sorry to hear that, now come over here and pick me up!"" My best friend and me quote that constantly. In fact we have actualy called each other asking for rides using lines from that one scene. I don't think theres ever been a teen flick as much fun as this one. The breakfast club, though more well known, is second to this among John Hughes' films."
5,Take a Day Off And Watch This a Coupla Times,"Matthew Broderick breaks into the business fabulously. A comedy AND a chase movie, what else can you ask for?"
5,Save Ferris,Share this with your teenagers if you got 'em. They'll realize that you already have the manual for playing hookie.Yucks and yucks: over and over agian.
1,Hated it,"I was showing this to you teen age grandchildren. One asked to turn it off as the language was offensive to him. Where are the good, decent moral movies today?"
5,BUELLER!,"If you love 80's movies, or comedy you'll enjoy this! I loved this movie the first time it came out and I'm glad it's now part of my home collection!"
5,OMG ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE!!,"FERRIS BUELLER came out when i was like 3 years old...i remember seein it ...and i loved it...im really and 80's movie fan...this, along with the Goonies, is the best film ever made. Its so funny. Worth Buying!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome movie,This movie is one of my all time favorites. Who hasn't seen this movie? It rocks! Funny and clever from start to finish. The commentary is great too.
5,perfection!,everything I asked for :D dvd was brand new. perfect movie. the extra features were great! lovely to be able to watch this movie whenever I want!
5,80's movies ..... ahhhh The Big Daddy,"This is one of the movies that reminds me most of the 80's when I too was a high school student thinking along similar lines ""I'm not European, I'm not going to be European, so why do I need to learn about European socialists?""I suppose you can say it's dated, most things take on the trappings of their time. Ferris Bueller has almost become emblematic of them. Still, dated lingo or not, the movie was and is, at it's heart, just pure fun. Remember, life moves pretty fast, if you don't stop and looka round once in awhile you'll miss it."
5,"OK, whatever Amazon's review meant.... this movie kicks!","I am a teenager and I love this movie! My parents rented it when I was about 12 and I loved it then and I bought it when I was 17 and I still love it! It's a real accurate portrayal of High School life and this if by far Broderick's best performance ever! Let's not forget the classic scene with his friend's Ferrari crashing through the back of the raised garage and Mr. Rooney, who resembles some of the staff in my High School! :-) This movie is a true gem! It's hard to tell it was made in 1986! Wow! It still makes me laugh every time I see it!"
5,Almost Perfect Audio/Video Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.I am very pleased with both the audio and video quality of this Blu-Ray. The video quality was great for a movie this old. Although there was minor grain in some background scenes, detail was excellent. I have seen this movie on DVD, and noticed a lot of detail I've never seen before. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 sounded great. I didn't notice a lot of strong surround sound or sub-woofer bass, but it was more than adequate.This is a very good movie."
2,My rating is no reflection of the movie,"I give this DVD edition 2 stars. One star is for the widescreen presentation. Chances are very few fans of this film has seen it in its original form for some time. The second star is for the enjoyable commentary from director John Hughes. But, in typical Paramount fashion (still bitter from their inital resistance toward the DVD format) this DVD does not come close to honoring this wonderful film! Hughes speaks of many deleted scenes that do not appear. Not so much as a trailer, or even talent files. I am often dissapointed with Paramounts overpriced under featured DVDs - this is no exception. I hope someday this film will recieve the DVD tribute it deserves!"
5,How I love the 80s!,"This movie has always been one of my faves, and I was very happy to finally purchase it to watch whenever I'm in need of a good laugh! From the opening scene to the credits, this movie is extremely entertaining and full of craziness and witty humor!""It's a little childish and stupid, but then again, so is high school."":DSave Ferris!"
4,Actual aspect ratio is 2.35:1,Anyone put off by the currently listed aspect ratio of 1.66:1 should note that the actual aspect ratio of the Bueller... Bueller Edition is 2.35:1. I've added a screen capture to the image gallery for verification.
3,Yes you can,"I have seen this movie on several occasions and it never gets old. It is a feel good movie. Ferris Beuller's philosophy ""Yes I Can!"""
5,Great,A t.terrific movie that will make you laugh and have you thinking about ones attitude towards life. A must see for everyone.
3,Bought for BF,"Classic movie, typical teenagers. Bought this for my bf, he loves it. It fun, cliches now. what more can i say."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST,"This is the best movie I had ever seen, it's a classic that shows that there are important things in live other than school, we don't stop to see or enjoy."
5,Best Movie Ever!!!,"How can i sum up my favorite movie ever in just 1,000 words? It is the funniest, most creative movie i have seen in a llllloooooonnnnnggggg time(besides star wars, of course)and i love ferris!!! Rooney eats it!!!"
1,Blu Ray Quality was horrible.,"I got the blu-ray as a package with another one and first of all it did not have the white sticker at the top of the box indicating that it hadn't been opened, and second of all then I sat down to watch it the quality was horrible. The sound didn't match the picture and I had to stop watching it because it just got worse. I'm really unhappy with this product."
2,Ferris Bueler family friendly?,"Though the item came in perfect condition, I don't think this title is family friendly. Sure, it's a hilarious movie but foul language is continuously uttered throughout. The movie would be just as funny and entertaining without all the swearing and would be appropriate to a larger audience.It's so frustrating when film makers/writers continuously show that they have no knowledge of the many thousands of words available for use in the English language, and limit themselves (and the viewer) to the same mundane use of the ""famous 7""."
3,"Funny, pleasent though kind of childish","I liked the film ""Ferris Buellars Day Off."" It's a little funny, pleasent comedy. Harmful to be sure. Though some of the themes are very childish. And I hate it how Matthew Broderick keeps talking to the audience. All in all its a pretty good film. If you want small laughs and not lots of violence. This movie is the ticket for you."
2,Uneven,"Broderick was well suited for this comic role, and the film begins amusingly enough. However, it runs into a number of problems: 1.) It shifts its tone all over the place, suddenly deciding to become serious over the incident with the car's destruction. Nor is the suddenly serious side aptly resolved. 2.) Ferris oddly abandons his talking to the audience fairly early on. 3.) The makeup throughout has been poorly done. You can see it obviously in every close-up. 4.) Ferris becomes quasi-heroic for mouthing the words to ""Twist and Shout"" in a parade, when actually it is the recorded song itself which seems to be fuelling the joy and mayhem. All in all, the film is pretty shallow, but could have been good had it stayed true to its beginnings, both stylistically and content-wise. It needed another rewrite."
2,I guess I'm all alone on this one,"High school student Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) decides to take the day off from school and uses his superior wits to treat his best friend (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend (Mia Sara) to a good time. I am astonished that this film has developed such a following over time. It is a very slight story, not particularly funny, with a sappy ending and two truly annoying performances from Broderick and Ruck. I didn't like it when I first saw it back in the 80s and it hasn't improved over time. However, 256 (as of this writing) other reviewers have apparently taken this film to their hearts, so why listen to me?"
4,even young one's will love,"i disagree with others who have said that this movie is only enjoyed by those who were ""teenagers"" in the 80's. i was born in the 80's and have LOVED Ferris's antics ever since i first saw them. i also know many of my younger friends who love this movie, and it is my boyfriend's FAVORITE movie. anyone who has wanted to skip school for a day of fun and adventure will enjoy this movie!!!"
5,What I wished I'd done in high school.,"Matthew Broderick's role in this movie makes you wish that high school really could have been that much fun to get away from, (or that easy.) Of course then you have his sister who thinks that he's out to make her life miserable, but he's only trying to show how much fun life can be if you only let it. His exploits around the town keep you wondering if he'll actually get away with skipping school, and if he can ever get Camaron to relax and enjoy it. Then to make the movie even more fun you have Principle Mooney who knows what kind of a person Ferris really is and will got to almost any lengths to prove it."
5,FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF,"If you were a teen in the eighties,,,,,,This was one of your favorite movies! Along side of Fast Times at Ridgemount High, and Last American Virgin"
5,Great movie,"Ferris is still great after all of these years. It is funny, funny, and funny. Ferris and his buds take us back to our high school years."
4,"Funny Movie, looks great on blu-ray","I love this movie and it looks even better on Blu-ray, the special features are great. Its soo cheap I think everyone should buy this for themselves or as a gift."
4,"Gee, thanks Paramount...","Film buffs, DVD collectors, and John Hughes fans beware! The ""Bueller...Bueller..."" edition DVD does not include the commentary track by writer/producer/director John Hughes which was included on the original 1999/2000 DVD release. It is a great commentary and is sorely missed from this edition."
4,Great movie and a solid Blu-ray transfer. Wish it had the DVD commentary though.,"This movie is an 80's classic. Great comedy mixed with a great cast. The Hi-Def transfer to Blu-ray is also a significant improvement over the DVD releases. The only missing ommission is the Commentary track that exists on the DVD version. Had I known this I wouldn't have bought the Blu-ray and held out for a re-release WITH the commentary. Either way, it's a great disc that does have some good extras on it."
2,Paramount screws up AGAIN,"Are you thinking about buying this edition? Well, don't do it. Fortunately for you the original dvd release of this is still available and it is the one you should get. Why? Simple - it has the John Hughes commentary and THIS ONE DOESN'T. Paramount, what is your problem? Can't you do ANYTHING right? I would have picked THIS up again - if it had the commentary. Don't waste your money on this edition. Paramount can't even release an excellent film like ""Breakdown"" without screwing it up (on that dvd, the menu is presented anamorphically but the feature IS NOT!). Believe me, if I was running things at Paramount you'd get VALUE for your money, not WASTE like this."
4,One of those 'Bring Me Back' films,"That is what this film is all about. True the film is dated and has some major plot holes which have been covered by other reviews, but on the whole, a wonderful trip down memory lane for those old enough to remember. No one is immune to the pranks and antics of this film. I tried similar things on my teachers in high school and thought I was original until this film appeared. Give it a shot... you should be laughing within minutes of the action."
2,"Horrible Blu-Ray, always fun to watch the film though","2 stars for the classic itself, but a horrendous Blu-Ray.The picture quality was right up there with the worst transfer I have seen. Large volumes of grain, hair, spots on the lens, blur, etc. Every once in awhile the alternative camera provided some nice clarity (the aerial city shots and one road sequence with the red car). I panicked one time thinking a pixel had failed on my plasma, but upon inspection it was a dot on the lens. There was absolutely no effort put into the preservation here.The sound was standard, and typically the only clear mixture was the ""Oh Yeah"" end title sequence and one or two other music montages. There was no time spent on cleaning up the monotone 2.0 either.Extras: All the same ones (word for word) as on the special edition, nothing new.This has been 0/2 on new BDs this week...frustrating."
3,"A classic movie, but stick with original release","This is one of my all time favorite comedies. I remember watching it all the time when I was a kid and I still get a kick out of watching it now. So, your probably wondering why I only gave it 3 stars. I'm writing this review solely based on the special features. Like some other people have said, the special features on this edition is just ok. The one thing that really hurts this edition is the missing audio commentary by John Hughes, which can be found in the previous dvd release. Overall, an amazing movie with just so-so special features."
4,Bueller? Bueller? Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?,"It's a bit better quality than the DVD, but not incredibly better.If it wasn't inexpensive I would have stuck with the DVD version."
3,Very very over-rated,"When making a list of popular teen movies from the 80's, 'Ferris Bueller' is always in the top ten. That may be well and good, but it never appealed to me the way 'The Breakfast Club' did. Now I say right off the bat that Mia Sara was absolutly beautiful, she steals the scenes she's in away from Matthew. She is the only reason I ever watch this when it comes on TV.John Hughes may be known for his far out movies (Weird Science), but this one just goes over the top a tad. When 'Get Well Ferris Banners' are displayed in the city, that's when I usually lose my patients with this flick. However the restaurant scene with the snooty Matrie'D is very good.Check out the cameo of a very young Charlie Sheen at the police station."
2,A typical movie from the 80s!,"It's has good scenes and some funny moments, but it is just an average movie. Certanly not the best movie from the 80s .Doesn't deservers the sucess that it had. Instead of it, watch some other 80s teen classics, like THE LOST BOYS, better in all aspects than this one!"
5,Ferris rox,this is my FAVE movie after watching it last night with a couple of friends. it's 'bout this boy who everyone REALLy likes cuz he gets them out of school or does favors 4 them. in this movie ferris pretends 2 be sick and gets 2 stay home. he and his best friend play trix on peole and go 2 pick up ferris's girlfriend. its really hilarious
3,"One feature, but it's almost enough...","(Instead of reviewing a film you probably already know, I stick to DVD special features)Those Extras:Commentary: HUMONGOUS treat. That John Hughes took the time out to go scene by scene for us was too cool. You won't go away still curious about how the film was made.Overall: Even with the commentary being it, the chance to hear Voice of the 80s Generation Hughes record a track bumps this up to a three. This wasn't dubbed a Special or Collector's Edition, so you gotta feel a more jacked-up offering will be along soon. New interviews, deleted scenes, a BTS and even the trailer(!) will be awesome."
5,Great Buy!,Brand new in package. Great buy and quickly shipped to my home. I am excited to watch. Will be doing business in the future!
4,Go Ferris,I loved Ferris Beuller`s day off.Matthew Brodrick is so funny in this comedy that makes you laugh so much that you`re bouncing off the walls.You`ll be laughing ang crying from laughing when you see these kids learn from a troublemaker and find out what New York City is really.You`ll laugh so hard you`ll need a bucket.Really enjoyVictoria Knops
5,Ferris Bueller's Day Off region 2,"Although it took some time before I received it, the DVD is in excellent condition."
3,i love the 80's,"This kid plays a trick.. To pretend to be sick from school. Hilarious the way he gets into and out of trouble while the school is in on his act knowing he is in fact pretending , but he is always outsmarting them."
3,Average Film.,"During the years that this movie has been released, I had never gotten around to watching it until just a while back. It wasn't bad, but not great either."
4,"Classic movie, great quality","As a movie, Ferris Bueller's Day Off needs no presentation, is a classic! It was great see again this wonderfull movie. Altough, the extras could be a little better. Maybe the fact that in the 80's they didn't expect to insert this extras in the VHS's didn't help. The quality of the image and sound is great. Overall, a great Blu-ray and a wonderfull deal."
4,I don't agree with the Amazon Editorial,"There are certain films that become timeless classics. Hughes put out two of them in the eightees and this is one of them. (The other being Sixteen Candles). I hope Amazon doesn't take offense, but I bought this at a department store over the weekend. A young bespectacled cashier, who couldn't have been a day over 16, remarked that Ferris was his all time favorite movie. Yes, your kids probably won't like this movie, but your teenagers will.....and you will too.There is just one Special Feature on this film and it is the director's commentary. At times, Hughes delivers some interesting history behind his directorial decisions, but at other times he merely narrates the plot. Too bad the folks at Paramount didn't add a cast member to the commentary. Even without the cast member, fans of Ferris will still enjoy the story behind Cameron's fake voice."
5,Hardest I ever laughed watching a movie.,I laughed my butt off watching this video. It is full of humor from beginning to the end. Especially when Ferris uses his computer to produce bodily noises for phone conversations. There is a hilarious scene showing the garage attendants going on their joyride in the sportscar. This film is great for any kid who always wanted to get back at administrators.
4,A classic must-see,"This is a movie for a rainy day or any time you are bored. It's a classic that can be watched over and over again, at any age. I recommend this to anybody who wants to call in sick and relax for a few hours."
4,Ferris Buellers Day Off,"Ferris Bueller's has the kind of life style every kid wants! He's young, care free and v.popular. I think the movie is brilliant, it's one you adore, no matter how many times you watch it. Matthew Broderick portrays Ferris fantastically and has us all in fits with his antics. You can really believe in the character. A film to treasure for life"
5,Shake it baby now !!,"I originally saw this movie on June 27th 1986 when I graduated from High School and loved every second of it. This is the kind of movie that I have quoted scenes from to my friends ever since. And while the story forces you to distend belief quite a bit, the central focus should be something we all take to heart; That is ""If you don't stop to enjoy life every once in a while, you might just miss it."""
5,A Classic That Holds Its Own,"Of all the Brat Pack teen movies that were all the rage in my youth, the one that stands the test of time the best is Ferris Bueller's Day Off. While I still enjoy my Breakfast Club and my Pretty in Pink, it is more from a nostalgic aspect. These movies just don't have the same substance to me as they once had when I was 15 years old. If I once related to the shallow heart strings that these movies tugged at, I no longer do. They feel... contrived. Ferris, on the other hand, still manages to not only bring me back to my mispent youth, but also reminds me of what it truly was like being a teenager. The exhuberance of a day skipping school and the pain of not being able to relate to your parents at all is all there.Don't get me wrong... I still love all my brat pack movies, but I would never suggest someone born after 1980 to watch any of them except this one. Ferris Bueller holds its own in any generation. Besides, who can resist Ben Stein?"
1,"Movie is great, DVD transfer stinks!","As always, when I replace my VHS copies of my movies with DVD's I check the format to make sure that I am getting true widescreen presentations. Ferris, I'm sad to say, is the worst that I have seen when it comes to the so-called widescreen format. If you have ever compared the full screen version to the DVD widescreen version you will see that all was done basically was to insert the black bars on the top and bottom of the picture. There are scenes where we should be seeing people's entire bodies but in the widescreen they are cut to the waistline. If you still have your VHS copy, KEEP IT! At least until the studios stop cheating us and start to actually release true widescreen formats on ALL of their DVD's and not just a select few."
2,Commentary missing??????????,"I just got the Bueller..Bueller edition. The great Hughes commentary is missing. I guess I'll have to rent the old dvd to hear it. But I just wanted to say that Paramount should put this one up the a for leaving out the only special feature that's interesting to film enthusiasts like me. I mean, come on!! Just give us a product that will satisfy us. They put commentary on the new Airplane and Tommy Boy dvds. Why couldn't they fit it onto this? They suck.. All you should buy the old dvd for 9.99. Thanks to all the reviewers who wrote what the commentary said. Could someone at Paramount slap someone in charge please? I'll pay you."
5,"""Oh Yeah...""","While an older movie filmed in the mid 80's, Ferris Beuller's Day Off is still a classic and a favorite by many to this day. Featuring stars like Mattew Broderick, Alan Ruck and Jennifer Grey, the storyline is one that any teen can relate to. Skipping school, being cool and living a leisurely life are the motto's of this dream come true movie for any high school student. By far one of Matthew Broderick's best movies, not only does this movie that show class skipping highschoolers how it's done, the music is great too. Be sure to check out the movie and its soundtrack. Five very big stars for this classic film."
5,How can I go to school... On a day like this!!!,"What else can you say, that hasn't already been said about this movie. A classic, hit, etc! There is nothing. Matthew Broderick and crew have done nothing short of amazing on this film. If you don't own, get it!"
4,"""80's Comedy Classic!""","Matthew Broderick, Alan Ruck, Mia Sara and Jeffrey Jonesstar in this 1986 John Hughes comedy. A teen plays hookywith his friends while his principal tries to catch him. I'veliked this since I was a kid and glad to have this specialedition. It has nice picture and sound plus cool extras.I highly recommend this 80's comedy classic."
4,Classic Movie,"Classic movie, well written and a fun distraction for most anyone young at heart (and a need or wish to skip school just once)."
4,STILL A CLASSIC,"I was sceptical about watching this again, some fifteen years after it was released . I could remember the storyline, but thought it may have become dated. What a surprise to find that 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' is still a great film - and extremely clever too. I actually enjoyed it more this time around. I would class it as a true 80's teenage movie classic - up there with 'Breakfast Club' and '16 Candles'. Watch this, and then watch Matthew Broderick in 'Election', it's amusing to see him play a teacher after playing a devious student in 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'. Matthew is an excellent actor, both of these films are a must for your DVD collection.DVD Evaluation - Has no extras at all. Picture transfer is excellent, sound quality is average."
3,(A seemingly) Aging Flute,"This is good, solid work, as usual with Weisberg. Nevertheless, he seems to have ""softened"" somehow, especially when compared to his well-ahead-of-its-time, energy-packed, early 80's ""Listen to the City"" album. The energy once pumping out of a younger Tim Weisberg is to be missed in this recent album."
1,don't waste your money,"i think a one star rating is being generous. i bought this used and wished i hadn't wasted my money. the cover of moondance is worth keeping only because of kenny rankin's vocal, the champlin song is ok but certainly not as good as another reviewer suggested and the remaining songs are mediocre smooth jazz (and that's being kind). i really don't understand why a cd this poor gets released while a really fine recording like nightrider is only available as a used lp. if you haven't heard nightrider you should consider buying it on vinyl if you can find it."
3,Time Traveler - Tim Weisberg,Tim Weisberg continues to pound out CDs years after I first met him on the First Fogelberg Album.
5,Beautiful music through the years,This soulful man has been creating beautiful music through the years....listen to him breathe!
1,"Not very ""complete""","I was expecting a soup to nuts video of detailed motorcycle tank painting. It is very incomplete and makes assumptions that you already know everything about paint reducers, paint gusn and airbrushes. Not a very complete guide. To be called complete, it should have some details regarding paint selection, color systems, reducers..etc... There is nothing at all about those important details. I'd pass this video by..."
4,catherine&queen latifah better than.......renee!!!,"greatest sountrack of all time maybe like the bodyguard.Catherine voice was amazing,stong,sexy,loud,she can be a singer if she want.my favourite:all that jazz,when you're good to mama,class,nowaday,i move on,love is a crime."
5,BEST MOVIE EVER,"AHH i love this movie and soudtrack so much! i have seen the movie 4 times so far and almost know all the coreography for ""all that jazz"" one of my favorite songs in the movie. i love that scene the best but i love the ""cell block tango"" almost more! i cant get enough of the soundtrack and movie! im listening to ""all that jazz"" right now! after this movie catherive zeta-jones is my favorite actress! i was so happy about the awards at the oscars it recieved! best soundtrack ever!"
5,Hollywood at its greatest!,"My wife and I went to see this movie on a Fri. night to a half filled theatre however everyone around us, before the movie started, had seen the movie several times---I can now see why, this musical has the best that hollywood can offer in music,dance,lighting,sound-- we plan on seeing it again,plus have ordered the CD soundtrack. Hollywood may be filled with liberals but they sure know their business!!! Paul Peterson"
5,chicago in the house,list of the songs1-all that jazz 10/102-funny honey 10/103-when your good to mama 10/104-cell block tango 10/105-all i care about 1/106-we both reached for the gun 10/107-roxie 10/108-i cant do it alone 10/109- mister cellophane 10/1010-razzel dazzel 1/1011-class (BOUNS SONG ) 10/1012-nowadays (ROXIE) 10/1013-nowadays (hot honey rag )10/10there 's 4 more songs on the cd wont review then cuz i havent heard it but still get this cd ull love it a lot
1,What is this rap number?,"The movie will never compare to the original Broadway show and the Revival Broadway show but it is bareable to watch. Actually it's better than nothing. But to get the sound tract album is a waste of money. Your ears will not like the voices of the 3 main characters and then,why should they...Hollywood almost had it right. If you look at all the other musical movies over the ages they casted people that had musical talent...If you want a great cast recording of ""Chicago"" get the Broadway or Broadway Revival version. It's alot better on the ears. And what is the Rap thing at the end? Have they lost their minds? Where do they get this stuff from?...Plus it has NOTHING to do with the musical show ""Chicago"" and is a terrible insult to the original composers..."
1,Revival Soundtrack Better...,"The soundtrack to the revival musical is much better. Not only are its renditions of the songs heard in the movie WAY BETTER, but you hear a lot of songs that the movie's missing."
1,CZ and RK DO IT!!,what an album--and movie!ALL the songs are first rate-we are of the depression generation and LOVE 20's-30's music!!Take a tripinto the past--if you DARE! cant wait for the MOVIE!!looks likeMoulin Rouge
3,Not as good as the movie.,"Even though the movie was a big hit and won several Oscar awards, I didn't find the soundtrack as good as the movie. The music is nice but actually it's boring to hear. I feel that has a good production and Catherine Zeta-Jones and the rest of the cast (that includes Richard Gere, Renee Zellweger and Queen Latifah).I didn't find it intresting.I only like two songs from this album which are: ""Cell block tango"" sang by Queen Latifah, Lil'kim and Macy Gray and the other song that I like is ""Love is a crime"" performed by Anastacia.The whole music has the sound of the 20's and 30's.The biggest song of the soundtrack is the #1 dance hit ""love is a crime"" performed by Anastacia."
2,Chicago with-out the Jazz,"Practically growing up on the London Revival Cast with Ute Lemper and Ruthie Henshall, I was pleasantly unsurprised by the vocal talents of Renee Zellwigger and Catherine Zeta Jones. While both have very pleasant voices, they lack the ""umph"" which the London Revival Recording so well portrays. ALL THAT JAZZ, sounds faded, weak, and missing something. FUNNY HONEY is a nice attempt, and I do give Renee credit, but I still feel that Henshall was best. Overall, get the London CD, you will be much better off for your buck."
4,Chicago Soundtrack falls short (or really too long!!),"I usually don't buy movie soundtracks but I loved the movie Chicago so much that I wanted the CD but I was really disappointed that the producers felt compelled to include two selections that were not in the film, a hip-hop rendition (their words, not mine) of ""Cell Block Tango"" performed by Queen Latifah as well as ""Love is a Crime"" performed by Anastacia. These 2 bonus tracks, though they might have been inspired by the motion picture, were definitely of a different genre than the rest of the CD and were both unnecessary and irritating."
3,"An abridged, languid version","I love the musical Chicago which is why I have the original, New Broadway and London cast albums. This latest version is not as complete as the others and it wreaks havoc on the score with remixes. The pacing is slower which mars some of the energy this score demands: Cell Block Tango is far too languid and subsequently becomes a sensual exercise without the comic and ironic bite.Catherine Zeta Jones is a very good Velma Kelly and is a vocal asset. Richard Gere is just terrible, the others passable.Although the film version is a very good representation of the stage version, its pleasure are very visual: a DVD must. However, if one does want to listen to the complete score including Roxie's monologue with energy and verve, reach for the stage productions:Original Broadway for the best Velma Kelly- Chita RiveraNew Broadway Cast recording: Excellent Billy Flynn, AmosLondon Cast: Most complete/best Roxie/most energetic orchestra"
4,Terrific!,"The cuts from the film were fabulous and make me want to see the movie again and again! The ""bonus"" cuts were, for the most part, better left off the CD. They were obviously filler and I would have preferred encores of ""All that Jazz"" and ""He Loves Me So"" to fill that space!"
5,CHICAGO soundtrack brilliant and fun,"This soundtrack is incredible. From the first song on the CD your toes are tapping and your head is into the plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renee Zelweger are fantastic and so full of life and command so much attention. You feel the songs all the way deep into your soul. This soundtrack blows the actual play out of the water. Moving, exuberant and sexy! Loved it, listen to it every day. If you like musicals and jazz, this soundtrack is for you!"
3,It's All That,"A terrific soundtrack, The Cell Block Tango with Zeta-Jones et all is a delight , as is Class and When You're Good To Mama...all in all, an unusually good movie soundtrack, even if it pandered to the hip-hop crowd on the one track."
4,Amazing... except for a few,"I went to see the movie Chicago on a Friday night and loved the music so much that I bought this soundtrack the next day. This CD includes some songs that are not in the movie... by far the most dissimilar one to all the rest is the ""Cell Block Tango Remix"" by Queen Latifah. That's the only one that I really don't like, but other than that, I recommend this CD very highly!"
3,One star off each for the junk at the end...,"Why, oh, why did they feel it necessary to include the Anastacia (Sp?) song and the hip hop thingy at the end? What audience did they think was going to purchase the original soundtrack of a fine movie and want those two junky songs?I have to race to hit the stop button before these songs come on my stereo.Other than that, a great cd."
2,Poor Imitation of the Broadway Soundtracks,"This is enjoyable, but not nearly as good as the Broadway versions. 1996's cast album with Bebe Neuwirth and Ann Reinking is fabulous (James Naughton is an excellent Billy Flynn). The Gwen Verdon/Chita Rivera/Jerry Orbach album is also wonderful. The movie soundtrack does not come close to rivaling either one -- the actors were cast primarily as actors, not singers! Richard Gere comes off as especially weak."
4,it grows on you,i dont like jazz but some of the songs to my surprize grew on me. some of the songs were weak sauce but for the most part its pretty good.
4,CHICAGO is musically true to Original B'way,"The soundtrack recording of Kander & Ebb's ""Chicago"" is a surprise and a delight. As a Broadway purist, I really had doubts about a filmed version of any Broadway musical, let alone one as quasi-traditional as ""Chicago"". Rest assured, it is fairly true to the original (and 1996 revival). The vocalists are fine (not belters, but good anyway); orchestrations good (a little slim, but authentic to the period); and material relatively unscathed (although trimmed). But what is with the 'material inspired by Chicago' on the end of the album? Is it really necessary to accommodate and mislead a non-musical audience into believing these artists are part of the film? 4 stars for underutilized CD booklet (jacket). With the possible return of movie musicals to theatre screens, wouldn't it have been interesting to know just how & why ""Chicago"" came to the big screen??"
4,You have to have this,"This CD is awesome...I mean by no means does it compare to the original and revival...but it still is awesome...Catherine Zeta-Jones does an awesome job as Velma as does Renee Zelwigger as Roxie...the best tracks are All That Jazz, Funny Hunny, and Class (even thought it is not in the movie)...why 4 stars? Well I was not all to impressed with Richard Gere...I'm a singer myself and I dunno, is voice is just not appealing to my ear...though I loved his rendition of We Both Reached for the Gun..also, I didn't really like the rap version of Cell Block Tango...other than that I am thoroughlly impressed...go out and buy the soundtrack today!!!"
5,Totally All That Jazz!,"If you saw the film, you'd definitely appreciate this CD! The music is excellent, and really makes you feel great. And don't forget the Enhanced CD portion. The music and extras make this a CD way more worth every penny!"
5,A Razzler Dazzler!,"This is a first rate CD of show tunes from the Miramax's Oscar- winning movie, _Chicago_. All the cast are very talented, abd the songs are well sung, with feeling and excellent instrumental back ups. Highlights include Queen Latifah's ""When You're Good to Mama,"" and Richard Gere's ""Razzle Dazzle."" _Chicago_ was one of the best movies of 2003, and this soundtrack showcases it beautifully. Highly recommeneded."
5,Perfection!,Simply one of the best Musical Soundtracks ever produced. Far surpasses the revival Broadway versions. The definitive version of the score. This is the one to own.
4,"Love ""Chicago?"" Get the music","Great movie, great songs, and great actors who double as excellent singers as well. Everyone who is in this movie deserves special recognition for their singing (as well as dancing) abilities. After many listens, I still can't choose a favorite song, my choices lie in between ""Overture/And All That Jazz"" sung by Catherine Zeta-Jones, and ""Nowadays"" sung by Renee Zellweger. It was a nice surprise to hear John C. Reilly sing ""Mister Cellophane."" There is a song on here that was from a scene taken out of the movie called ""Class."" There is a second version of ""Cell Block Tango,"" except it is done in the form of a hip-hop song by Queen Latifah, Lil' Kim and Macy Gray. Surprisingly the song fits in well enough on this album. You can also use the CD in your computer disk drive to watch behind the scenes footage, and interviews. The only thing I was not crazy about was the Anastacia song, ""Love Is A Crime."" If you love this movie as much, as I do, get this soundtrack!"
4,"better than average, but...","The charisma and effort are there, but these movie stars don't have what it takes to carry a Broadway show. Richard Gere has noticably weak vocals and Renee Zellwigger could benefit from some serious vocal technique lessons. Catherine Zeta-Jones is the best of the three, and perhaps could pull of the show on Broadway. The tunes are catchy and the spirit of the cast makes listening a fun experience. The talent is definately there, if underdeveloped. If you don't mind the lack of vocal technique or development, the soundtrack is worth your while."
3,"Great movie, not-so-great soundtrack...","This musical turned movie was absolutely incredible. Catherine Zeta Jones was AMAZING. Rene Zelleweger was not the best (her dancing was mediocre and singing was a little better than her dancing). Overall though, this was a awesome movie. It definately will become one of my new favorites. The soundtrack, however, is less than to be desired. The orchestra and singers seem to lack the much needed energy that drives the music. Though the movie looked and sounded great the soundtrack is kind of dull and boring. For instance, my favorite song in the movie, Cell Block Tango (not the revised one by Queen Latifah) seemed to have no energy what so ever. The whole soundtrack seems dull in comparison to the glamorously exciting movie. My advice to you: buy the Broadway version. It is much better and has songs that were cut out of the movie."
4,Good Soundtrack,"I will say that i really don't care too much for musicals but this has to be the one musical that i can really like the music. Catherine Zeta Jones voice is excellent and really deserve that Oscar!!! Queen Latifah should have more songs, but the songs she does have she gives her all on them and surprises you and her vocal abilities. Renee also shocked me with her wonderful voice!!! Well please go get this you will not be sorry"
5,Swunderful,This is the greatest movie I have seen in a long time. Hope Hollywood (or whoever) gets this message!
5,Forever Jazzy,"As we watch the CABARET movie on our VCR, and we listen to Julie Andrews sing THE SOUND OF MUSIC's theme song, we, as the world, are in awe with the new CHICAGO movie.It's really amazing how this will change everyone's lives for years to come. How many generations have grown up watching THE WIZARD OF OZ? Soon CHICAGO will be a favorate that we can all pass on to the youth!As everyone has stated before, Renee', Catherine and Richard are simply amazing! SEE CHICAGO! AND IF NOT, BUY THIS CD! I PROMISE YOU WON'T BE UPSET!"
4,Good,"Richard Gere surprised me on this one as did Catherine Zeta-Jones but the real standout performance is Queen Latifah with ""When You're Good To Mama"". She belts it out with great gusto and proves that rappers don't always have to sound like crap. She should do more musicals. It took a little adjusting from what he's done recently but John C. Reilly can really sing. The only one who can't sing is Zellwegger. Her voice annoys me whenever she sings and I cringe. It's like nails on a chalkboard bad. But 95% of the cast isn't bad. The orchestrations were excellent, especially when you crank it up. If it weren't for Zellwegger, this would be getting five stars."
5,Amazing work of art,This music is so faithfully performed by the very talented ensemble that it brings back the 1920's vividly. Each song reflects a specific style of the music popular at the time. After listening to this CD I had to see the movie (which was also terrific) and then I had to buy the sheet music. Usually I simply enjoy a CD and move on. This one reached me.
4,Love it!,"I went out on a limb buying this soundtrack as I hadnt yet seen the movie. And I was glad I did. Having read many articles beforehand on Catherine Zeta Jones, I knew about her work in musicals, so I wasnt very surprised at her brilliant voice. Renee Zellweger also does an admireable job, complementing Zeta Jones's voice perfectly. Another highlight is Queen Latifah's spine tingling rendition of When Your Good To Mama. And whoever knew John C Reilly could sing so well?The only reason this soundtrack doe not receive 5 stars is the 2 end tracks which are vaugely annoying and seem pointless."
1,Not good...,So bad quality. First it recorded EP not SP. I regret buying this one. I should have chosen another JFK bio.
1,WENDIGO - SO MUCH PROMISE WASTED....,"If you want to waste your time on a movie then here you go! Being a film critic amongst peers and a indie film creator, I was simply blown away by the dry and plodding direction of Wendigo. Look up the term Wendigo, it is a Native American legend. There are so many heart-pounding possibilities that could have spawned from the palette of the Wendigo legend, and yet this pathetic movie does not even bother to dabble it's brush in it. Both my wife and I had a difficult time trying to understand why this contemptible movie was made. Simply put, a WASTE and FAILURE! It easily placed itself within my MP10 (Most Pathetic 10) list."
2,Low budget shows!!,"This movie was badly in need of more cash flow. It really came off as a ""B"" movie. I didn't like the ending. I didn't give a darn about the sex scene, it was fish cold. Weird little movie, but I did like the Wendigo! That's about all I liked. Didn't like the kid at all; didn't like the whiney spoiled psychologist wife; and didn't like the father much but more than the rest of his boring family."
1,One star is one too many...,"This is a lousy movie. Don't waste your money or time. Like many horror movies, this one starts out interestingly enough, but quickly spirals down a slippery slope to the garbage heap. It coulda been something, it coulda been a contenda, but it only really stinks. Not scary, kinda silly, especially the Wendigo itself, which is so fake, with special effects that had to have been created by third graders. The back of the DVD is incredibly misleading; I think they where writing about a different movie. Not worth renting, either."
1,Atrocious,"I am a fan of independant films, and have often found joy in little heard of low budget movies, but his film is positively horrible. Chock full of needless character over-development, a purely gratuitous sex scene and a useless ""Matrix""-like pan and scan, this was two hours of my life I would like back. To make this worse, the director's commentary, which is usually enjoyable on any film, was nothing more than the director stating it was my fault as a brainwashed audience member if I didn't enjoy the movie as I obviously was lacking in imagination and an open mind. No horror or suspense combined with poorly used ideas make this movie a must miss feature."
3,Good movie,Minuses for hokey effects - would have been better off without showing any effects if you can't make them realistic.Otherwise a solid horror movie. Good acting. Some camera effects were effective.
1,No-budget horror done wrong,"After watching this on DVD and on HBO this independent horror movie has to be the absolute worst horror movie since""Blair Witch Project,Cabin Fever,House of the Dead,Wrong Turn,and Halloween 3. Wendigo is a no-budget movie that has no special effects or blood or a monster or villian but a curse and a forklore about a deer. A boy and his family visit a house and then start to meet three weird people that hunted a deer and then the boy has hallucinations and then a man gives him a little souvenir of a deer on a totem pole and then that causes his dad and a few others to die. Not one scene is scary or suspensful but the movie is weird and boring. the ending is by far the worst ending in a horror movie history. Please avoid this movie at all costs and if it is free at a video store don't rent it because it is a rip-off. If you want a good no-budget horror movie rent Basket Case or Evil Dead."
1,Not a very good movie,"The ONLY thing that was good in this film was the 'atmosphere.' The story was not suspenseful in the least. There is very little drama, no suspense and definitely nothing to even tie the events together. Some have described this movie as having 'subtle' suspense, but I wouldn't even go that far. This is one to avoid."
2,Be afraid. Be very afraid......,"of mistaking this ""B"" Grade horror film for and art house independent flick. This has all the components. From the man in the rubber monster suit to the obligitory sex scene with a half-second flash of breast to the grainy film quality. The only reason why I give this two stars instead of one is that the acting was not as bad as some and the twist at the end was moderately original."
2,"Thrilling At First, But. . . . .","I expected this film to be at least a LITTLE scary, but it was not. As the movie progressed, I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. Nothing ever did. The beginning was great, but the follow through was mellow. If you are looking for a film to entertain you, skip this one. On the other hand, it is a decent piece of film noir with many hidden signs and symbols where then you may be able to stand the humdrum plot. You could apply the film techniques and turn it into more of an artsy kind of film if you wanted to. But it would still take some time and analyzing. Its acceptable presentation of film noir saved it from me rating it only one star.If you are looking for any kind of thriller or horror film, you need to look elsewhere. One of the only movies I have ever bought where I thought it was a waste of money."
1,"Not Horror, just Horrid","My wife and I rented this at the video store one night, the description on the box sounded great, the movie wasn't. It has nothing to do with the Algonquin legend of a cannibalistic were-creature. Funnier still is the depiction of the actual creature (see the special feature section). It was so bad, the movie has become a running joke between my wife and I: ""Honey, they're making a sequel of your favorite movie...Wendigo."" ""That X-men 3 really sucked we should had rented Wendigo again!"" ""Jeeper Creepers II wasn't near as scary as Wendigo."" You get my drift. This movie just didn't live up to what little hype it even attempted. As I was writing this I asked my wife what's the scariest movie we've seen lately, she began to laugh ""You mean Wendigo?"" Stay away unless you want to start your own series of one-liners."
1,Don't waste your time!!!,"My husband and I rented this movie for $, and I wanted a refund!! It started ok, but went nowhere fast! I was very disappointed. Little or no action, and all of a sudden the credits start to roll!!"
1,What's that smell?,"Is it turkey? This is one with all the trimmings. Bad dialog,bad acting, really bad improvization, no plot. Lots of real kewl camera and editing work. Even has a gratuitus 360 shot of turkey feathers flying around a little boy chopping up ... something.Erik Per Sullivan was pretty good (You know, Dewey from Malcolm in the Middle).This movie just plain stinks no matter how hard the 'director' tries to convince you otherwise. Save your dough."
1,Huge let down...,"I was excited about this movie for almost a year now. I somehow found the coming attraction and website online... I even contacted people from the website to find out when it was coming out on DVD (I had missed it in the theater). I love horror movies, however this movie totally stinks. I read some of the other reviews here and I don't understand how there is anything positive to say. The acting .... Special effects were bad. Cinematography was lame. Storyline and script very, very weak. I'm sorry to sound so negative, but I was seriously looking forward to something worth my time."
2,i dunno!,sometimes i wonder if people ever really watch scary movies when they say this was sooooo scary. It was ok. Doesnt really do anything and ends with one of those (i wanna break my tv) endings.watch if you are bored but dont rush out to rent or buy it
1,garbage!,what ever you do dont buy this movie!i heard about this movie from creature corner.i saw it at the store and decided to give it a try(big mistake).the cover said the scariest movie of the year.it was so boring that about half way through my girlfriend fell asleep.this isnt a horror movie at all its more like a made for television movie.there is nothing scary about this movie at all.if someone is scared of this movie than they have serious problems and need to get professional help.
4,A pretty neat film,"After readings countless good reviews for this film i decided to go down my local video store and rent it. Wendigo is an extremely enjoyable film for the small budget it was made from and it builds tension superbly. All the actors are very good especially the very convincing erik per sullivan as spooked miles. But despite being a very good film the wendigo itself is laughable and the ending is a bit of a kop out,like there's a scene missing. I still enjoyed wendigo despite the ending and i recommend you check it out."
2,Misleading marketing.,"I don't know what the people who liked this movie are drinking cause the last time I looked up the word ""horror"" in the dictionary it didn't say anything about people standing out in the snow for 85 minutes talking until finally a cod-piece wearing devil deer comes running by at 60 mph (on his hind legs) clucking like a woodchuck.If the whole movie had been like that 5 minute deer part this would have been the funniest movie going but instead it was so boring I wanted to smash my face into the coffee table."
1,Be Very Afraid...,"Yes, be afraid of the Wendigo. This movie really scared me. It scared me that someone thought that this worthless script needed to be made into an actual movie. It scared me that any self-respecting actor would waste their time and effort on this movie. The corny sound track and hokey special effects did coax some chuckles out of me but no screams. This movie was so bad I feel a little guilty for actually wasting my time to write this review. If nothing else remember this, if you see the Wendigo, be afraid, be bery afraid and get yourself as far away as you can."
1,"Looks good, but disappointed..........","The product looks sleek and I especially like the wicker baskets it comes with. However, the changing table/wicker basket has an odor to it - especially the baskets. We have tried to air out the baskets in hope the odor will go away, however they still have an odor. At this point I read somewhere that one should leave vinegar in a bowl in the room and it should absorb the odor, so at this point this is what my husband and I are trying. If the odor does not go away, then no matter how nice it goes with our other furniture we will have to return it."
3,It's ok,"There's nothing really bad about this changing table but there's nothing really great about it either. The baskets were difficult to put together and since I'm only 5 ft tall, the table is actually a little high for me. But the height is perfect for my husband who is 5' 10""."
1,Several defects,"I found four product defects by the time the table was half way built. First, there was a drilled hole that was out of line, making it impossible to screw that particular rail on. Second, one of the baskets was assembled incorrectly, so that the bottom could not be attached. The wood was split on two of the rails. I didn't want to waste any more of my time by bothering to exchange it for the same product, for fear that it would also be defective. Toys R Us would only give me a store credit or credit the purchaser who gave us this for a gift, even though I had the receipt. Would have preferred cash since I don't like any of the other changing tables they have and will have to purchase one elsewhere. Poor customer service, I plan to write my local newspaper."
4,Good Read...,I am biased since the author is my Father....We spent years apart so I wanted to get to know him through his work.I was not disappointed. I found his works to be very interesting.
3,NC star red dot,This is the weakiest red dot I own. it gets the job done but I would not use this red dot on any thing other than a paintball gun. Its lense cap already got lost on the first game I took it on as they really dont stay on too tight. It does come with two sets of batteries however. I really dont like the on off dial. It feels very chessy. the dot gets very burly as it gets more dialed. Nc star makes better dots!
3,"Starts strong, grinds to hault midway through","The detail with which Carlo writes of the murders is impressive, although the calibur of his writing could be better. I found it difficult to put the book down up until the apprehension of Ramirez, which takes place at maybe pg. 300 or so. Thereafter, the narrative becomes somewhat bogged down with superfluous details, such as meticulous but frankly boring recitation of courtroom antics and other minutiae that ultimately has no bearing on the outcome of the case or the story in general. Admittedly, it's tough to achieve the same level of excitement in the second act for obvious reasons; however, if you pick up a copy of Bugliosi's ""Helter Skelter"" you'll find that it's not quite an impossible feat."
3,Not too bad,"I got this book expecting it to me really good after reading all the reviews. As some people said on here the first few hundred pages are very good but when you get the trial part it just draaaaaaaaaaags on!! I mean the author wrote EVERY single thing that was said and happened in the court, if someone blinked he would put that in. It did get a bit better after the trial part when it went into the actual sentence and spoke about his new wife he married in jail, etc. Still there are much better books out there on serial killers."
4,Let me remain objective,"The book has it's dry spots. One example being is the 2 or 3 chapter written on Richards parents, however I seen it as necessary in order to understand the psychological development of Ritchie. All in all Philip Carlo impressed me with his halfway objectiveness. After all, who isn't a little biased? Carlo isn't your typical Diane Fanning or Anne Rule. He lets you see that Richard was a child once, that he was a victim just like every one else. Honestly, the writers empathy made me tear up at times. I highly recommend this book to any one who wants to know more about Ramirez."
5,A must read for true crime readers!,"I remember reading this book years ago and I would get so scared at night if I heard just the slightest noise, that I would make my husband get up and check the house. Richard Ramirez is a monster in human form and it's scary to think there are so many others that roam this earth as well. It definitely made me be more aware of my surroundings and make sure my home is secure as can be."
2,Who let this guy get into print?,"If you just want a recitation of crimes and facts, then this book will probably satisfy you. But if you want analysis and insight, you're out of luck here. If you expect continuity, good grammar, and proper spelling -- in other words, basic good writing -- you'll be even more disappointed. Shame on the editor who let this mess get into print."
1,The Night Stalker,"I had become very interrested in Richard as I grew up in California and lived there durring the time these crimes happened and was all scared all over California so I had to know why. I also felt compelled to know him, to know why, and to understand why. After reading this book, though I felt the author had him already guilty from the beginning of the book. He tells about all the horrible crimes as he says Richard explains them to him, then goe's into the family history, they the capture and court preceedings. I thought in the US one was innocent until proven guilty. It's not what happened here all though there is overwhelming evidence here, the fact remains, that this man's rights were violated.......... The author had to be in it for the money, otherwise he would've started from the life of the Ramirez family or the court proceedings then the life and then the crimes he claims Richard confessed to him. Another great injustice in our so called freedom of the USA."
4,A great True-Crime novel...,"Carlo did a great job of telling about Rameriz's actual crimes. He made it seem as real as possible and actually made me cry! The only part I was bored with was when he was getting into the court trial, but that is because I am more interested in what he did. I am not a courtroom person, so I am not interested in that section of the story. I was very pleased with the detail of his actions. The psychology behind the criminal mind is what I am interested in. I think a true crime buff would really enjoy this one!"
2,Drab Recitation,"This is one of the few books I couldn't finish. The book starts off really strong for the first 100 pages or so. You get to read a detailed, journalistic account of Ramirez' crime spree, and some interesting information about his youth as well. But about halfway through, the novel transforms into one of the most boring courtroom ""dramas"" you will ever read. Carlo details all of the legal maneuvering, but Ramirez is so blatantly guilty that it is all rather pointless. And considering how the lawyers that strive to defend him are so shallow and fame-seeking, and the groupies that adore him so nasty and mindless, Ramirez almost seems like the most respectable person in the book. More detail about the crimes and less of the courtroom would have made this a far better book. Ramirez is only an interesting character because of his sociopathic tendencies. What happens after his capture can only be trivial and dull by comparison."
4,A must read!,"I would like to start off by saying that I do not condone the crimes that were described in this book. BUT I will say that this book is a must read for anyone who is a true crime buff or anyone thinking about doing drugs or entering the mental health field. This book clearly shows how low drugs,alcohol,porno, and lack of education can do to someone. Still referred as ""RICKY"" by his family, he is the youngest of five children. After reading this book, I would say that the ""victims"" who suffered the most were his own family---a poor Catholic Hispanic family in Texas.The book describes in stunning detail the crimes, crime scenes, the victims,the trial, and RR's family and himself. It is difficult to put down once you get started. The author visited each place and person including RR in order to write this book."
5,Awesome Thriller!,"Mr. Carlo has written a spectacular work here. It is so scary and absolutely not for everyone. I am one of those people who love being scared so I loved this book. As one reads the first part of the book, one cannot help thinking that Ramirez is in fact the devil. Carlo also discusses his boyhood, adolescence, capture, and trial. I found this stuff fascinating but I never felt any sympathy for Ramirez. I just became more and more scared as I read on. It was scary to shut the light off at night. It reads like a horror/thriller novel but it is true. And that is the most scary part."
1,I should have followed the reviews,"This holster looks cool, but its not worth even the little you pay. It took over a week to get to me and when I got it, I was not happy. IMPOSSIBLE TO DRAW YOU PISTOL!! DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,A piece of hogwash!,"""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" - the version I have is from 1955, and includes the original written Act Two, and the Act Two version Tennessee Williams wrote for Broadway. That said, I found this play to be the worst Williams play. I read ""The Glass Menagerie"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and I found both to be emotional, engaging, and thought provoking. This play does not include any of that. I failed to see the point, and I didn't understand the motivation for the cruelty shown to Margaret (Maggie). I was very disappointed. I do not recommend."
3,"For a required summer reading, it was actually a good book.","I was surprised when I read this book (as a requirement for school) and it turned out it was good. I love how Maggie is always trying to get Brick to love her, even though he can't stand sleeping in the same bed with her. I also like how she tells everyone that she is pregnant with his child."
3,This is Nick Fury,"Give Will Murray credit, he delivers the real goods. When he does the Destroyer or Doc Savage, he delivers the real character. He does the same here with good old Nick Fury. This is the real Nick -- unshaven, tougher than nails, talking through clenched teeth that are gripping a cheap cigar.We also have thew real SHIELD, complete with helicarrier, Dum Dum Dugan, and Val (way too little of her). This reads like a really, really good comic adventure, and works. I'm willing to accept all the ESP mumbo-jumbo, but then we also have the lamest of all the old SHIELD gags -- the Life Model Decoys (LMDs). How many times can you put up with the ""Oh golly, it was really just a lifelike robot"" plot twist.A real neat cover, and interior black and white illos by the artist formerly known as Jaunty Jim Steranko, who is the only guy who could ever really draw Nick."
4,"Move Over, Bond!","Will Murray does it again! Tight, authentic characterization and a well-written plot contribute to our favorite hard-bitten WWII vet's adventure. The action is fast and furious and SHIELD has rarely been portrayed better. Fans of the '60s series take note: this is set in modern-day, not during the reign of the Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division. High-tech gimmickry and hardboiled dialogue abound in this tour-de-force through the seamy underbelly of the Marvel Universe. I want more!"
4,S.H.I.E.L.D featuring Col. Nick Fury,"Only in recent years have I gotten back into the Marvel novels, and even back then I was reading comic books (late 70's & early 80's) I was selective on which ones I've read. So, I really don't remember reading about Nick Fury. So these novels has introduced me to Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. The storyline was highly enjoyable and the cast of characters that were easy to understand and were likeable. I truely enjoyed Will Murray's writing style and sense of humor in which he intregated into the book was excellent. Highly recommend this book to all the fans of Col Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D."
5,east Side Kid's,"another one off the east side kid's great movies very entertaining, fantastic acting these boys show how life in the big city can be."
1,JournalismScam,"If you are looking for a book that finds as many bad examples of bad teaching and bad professorship as a person could find ... this book is for you. But if you want a nuanced, and intelligent, approach to the problems of the professoriate, you will have to look elsewhere. The author piles egregious examples on top of one another and then thinks he has a case. To make the case that he wants, he needs to show that the majority, or at least a significant number, of professors pilfer away their days in idleness. Instead, like journalists who are on the prowl for ""bad scoop"", Sykes finds what he is was looking for ... but this is journalismscam, not research! I know far too many professors who work too hard even to be bothered with studies like this."
1,This Tabloid Journalism Has Feet Of Clay,"On the face of it the author makes it appear that he has a well-researched and persuasive case. Profscam is a sloppy and misleading diatribe. A professor myself, I am the subject of one of his claims. I looked into the note that he used to support his claim in my case and found the citation date to be ten months off for the referenced article (Chapter Five, #9, dated January when the publication was the following November). The quote cited was taken out of context and the cited article was decidedly positive while Sykes has tried to make it appear negative. This work is suspect and I am surprised and disappointed in those who have embraced its message. The careful reader will be able to deconstruct the author's real intent only to discover that the exercise was a waste of time."
3,"informative, but hurt by author's extreme bias","If you are looking for ""dirty laundry"" on university academics, Sykes has a washer-load full. His observations are interesting and insightful, but his presentation is rather extremist, one-sided and excessively pessimistic. If read critically, with effort to penetrate Sykes unabashedly malevolent attitude, there is knowledge to gain. But it is tedious nonetheless."
4,Planning to attend college; must read,"This insightful look into the ways in which teachers couch their subjects, cirricula and values, is a must read for those planning on higher education. Sykes follows the evolution of the modern university from its inception, to the present with surprising insight. Teachers & administrators may not know the facts themselves, but it's certian, they don't want you to ... Read, and survive. ****"
5,Too true,"Another customer reviewer (Allan Bloom --NOT the author of the ""Closing of the American Mind,"" but someone with the same name) attempts to debunk Sykes's book by a quibble over a date in a footnote.Sorry, prof, but such a minor mistake in no way vitiates Sykes's argument.Was, as Sykes states, the sole textbook for your class the ""Rolling Stone Book of Rock Video""? Did your students get credit for acting as extras in rock videos? Did your class ""analyze videotapes of Weird Al Yankovic singing 'Dare to Be Stupid?'"" If so, case closed, Sykes wins."
3,Redundant,there really is no point to release this album. the record company only wants to make more money so aviod and get ramones mania if your looking for a best of collection
4,Did exactly what it should,Nothing really special here. It charged the battery. Case closed. Now I'm just writing enough words to publish the review.
4,Must have replacement,"Item was to replace a hand down smart car, fits the yellow top battery. works well, but no indication when charging is complete. must follow manuel on how long to leave battery charging."
3,Cancellation procedure sucks!,"I think its great that the service is so quick to get your product out to you....HOWEVER, if I ordered the charger @ 2pm....then realize that I no longer need it(8hrs later) I should be able to cancel my order. I sent an email request 8hrs later requesting to please cancel the order....no response! I get an email the next morning stating the orders been shipped....great! Now, I guess I have to attempt to return the item...hope its easier than trying to cancel the order. There should be a better procedure in place for canceling orders."
3,battery charger,"I purchased this in July the shipping time was good. However, this charger looked as if it was used. It had some rust on it. It does work but I paid for a new charger, not used."
4,Works well,"Nothing fancy here, but it clearly works with the gray 12v battery for select models of Powerwheels toys, and the product description on the amazon site made it easy to identify which power supply was the correct one for the product I have."
1,Works great.,"We received our Power Wheels as a hand-me-down. The original owners lost the charger so I came to Amazon to replace it. When the charger arrived, I originally thought it did not match the battery that Amazon says it should go to (the grey battery with a three section opening). Eventually I realized that the connector from the actual Jeep to the battery and the connector from the charger to the battery do not look alike (at all) but both work. When this charger is inserted into the center portion of the grey battery opening, it will work perfectly. It took me about a month to realize that because I thought the connector should fill all three holes instead of just the one. Once I figured that out, we were golden. My kids love this toy now.I had to come back and edit my original review where I indicated they don't match. I can't seem to edit my star rating but I now think it's a 5 star item and I would recommend this charger."
3,"""N"" connector is correct for Barbie Jeep",This charger works fine and as expected. The only confusion I had was the connector. It doesn't look like the connector on the battery but it plugs in and works fine. The battery has 4 pins but the charger has only two so I thought it was the wrong one. I called the very helpful customer service dept at Fisher Price and was told it is correct.Just plug it in to the two pins in the middle. It works fine.
3,Good BUy,Good buy and easy to use with battery. I wish that it had a led light to let me know when it is charging
5,Charger,"We purchased this charger for a old hot wheels cadillac that a friend gave to us. We also purchased a battery with it, and everything works as advertised."
4,Works well,"I inherited a Power Wheels Jeep from a family member, however it was missing the charger. After looking around I found this was the most inexpensive one I could find. It seems to work well."
3,I wasn't sure which has a defect,"My bf bought it for my son's truck which we got from a neighbor who told us it just needs a new charger/ battery charger. So we bought this. Charged it as specified in the instructions manual. When we tried the truck it didn't start up. So, we were left wondering if the truck battery was broken or the charger we bought. We'd never know because it never worked. I put 3 stars only because I wasn't sure which is broken. And didn't want to give low stars Just cause it didn't work for me. But their customer service dept. could've done much more, much better by trying to work with us in determining if their product was at fault or our truck is juz broken. Just saying."
1,you disappoint! :(,ordered this may 30th & when the product is scheduled to arrive I got an email saying it was out of stock & would be back in stock in 2 weeks!! you disappoint! :(
3,A novel of the Civil War,"Forget the above quote about Eliphalet Hopper. Turns out he's a minor player. The true main character is Bostonian Stephen Brice and his long, long, looonnnnggg unspoken love for uppity Southern Belle Virginia Carvel. In between the years when they first meet to finally confessing their love for each other a minor thing known as the Civil War occurs. The setting is mainly St. Louis, a city like many others that is divided in its loyalties. Real-life people pop up now and then, like an unknown Grant delivering firewood and energetic Sherman in charge of a car line. Abraham Lincoln might as well be the Second Coming the way the author goes on and on about him. I'm giving the book three stars because it does move at a good pace and keeps you interested until the end. However, you must keep in mind the times and ways things used to be when this book was originally written. If you're offended by the N-word this novel may not be for you as it is used regularly."
4,Wonderful read,"I found this book on the shelf of books we moved in with my grandfather. I noted the owner, my great-grandmother. She was usually a mystery reader, so I read this to learn more about her. The book is easily read, and I couldn't guess where it was headed for sure with the little twists in it. I don't know enough of St. Louis history to know if the historical facts are accurate, but I will be doing research to find out the history of the Civil War in St. Louis!"
2,Worst 2003 ninja turtles figure so far,Don't get me wrong I love ninja turtles but this figure along with scootin leo are a waste of money because Mike can't even stand on the board well he can but he doesn't have magnetic feet so you can't actually play with it like a tech deck dude his board is chaply made but scootin leo's scooter is worse anyways the figure is not very detailed compared to the regular mike I don't really care how detailed it is but they should get better.My advice to you is pass this one and get the new just relised fightin' gear turtles or other new tmnt figures.
3,Good quality but sizes are deceiving,"Quality of the swim suit was fine, but could not tell that the sizing was for a baby. We ordered the swimsuit for our 7 year old. It's just a pain to be going back and forth with exchanges, so we ended up just returning it. They should provide more detail about the sizing on the web site."
4,cute sprinsuit!,We just ordered a small size suit for our daughter who is 18 months old. It fits well as she is tall for her age. I think this size would be an approximate 2T. The fuscia color is a bright pink - not quite as shown on the image that accompanies this product. It's very cute.
2,The ORIGINAL is a classic this is a bore ....,"The only reason I gave this poop 2 stars is for the role oc Chris Rock .... unfortunately he doesn't make it through the wole movie ..... I mean what they should have done is gotten rid of the guards, the warden and Sandler himself .....Even Burt Reynolds performace was below standard .... I saw ther original and the charaters no matter how mean and nasty had some redeeming values and that is what made this light hearted movie great..... In the remake the mean charactrers actually came across as mean trust me no comedic value of any kind type of mean ....If you hear anyone lagh during this film it's probably cause they are reading messages an their Blackberry !!!"
5,THE LONGEST YARD,"LOVE ADAM AND LOVE THIS MOVIE..............I PLAN ON GETTING MORE FOR SURE...NOT A WASTE OF MONEY..AN OLDER MOVIE, BUT A CLASSIC"
2,Not as good as the original!!,"Once again, Hollywood runs out of ideas and remakes a movie that doesn't need to be remade. Even with more colorful characters, there really is no need for this! Save yourself time and watch the original!"
3,A Good Movie For Casual Viewers and Sandler Fans,"Not one of Sandler's best films, but it isn't horrible by any means. This is mainly drama, but it does have it's side jokes. Having never seen the original film, I can only judge it based on the movie alone and it is good, but not great. Everyone in the movie is really good, but the story wants to drag in scenes. But, there are some moments I thought were really funny. If you are a fan of Adam Sandler, give this a try, but if you are a fan of the original film...there is a good chance that this won't live up to it. Very few remakes ever do."
2,Not his best.,"I am one of many big Adam Sandler fans, and I must say I was not impressed by this film. Most people expected a non-stop laugh out loud film, sorry to burst your bubble but this one does not live up to Sandler's other big hits. Compared to Billy Madison or Big daddy, the Longest Yard just doesnt cut it. The Longest Yard just doesnt have the laughs that the other Sandler films have, or the lines that everyone remembers. I saw this one in the theatres, not worth the 8 dollars. I recommend not buying this one but maybe renting it on a boring night."
1,Snore...,"If I wanted to see an hour and a half long football game, I could have turned on ESPN at home and save my $7.00 that I wasted on this movie. And that's all that this movie really was. It was a long, boring footbal game with some bad humor like seeing a fat guy's butt crack and having crossdressers as cheerleaders in between to get the less intellectual people in the audience to laugh and go on about what a great movie the Longest Yard is.Unless you are one of the less intellectual people (you know you are not and are better than that), don't waste your money on the Longest yard. See Cinderella Man instead."
3,Somehow not too bad,"This movie somehow succeeds in being mildly amusing and entertaining. I'm not really sure how it pulls this off, since it has more than enough negatives, such as:1) Adam Sandler, a 5' 7"" Pro MVP Quarterback?2) Many scenes that were supposed to be funny, such as Sandler with the Warden's secretary, that flopped.3) Transvestite overkill. First of all, I don't find a bunch a guys dressed in cheerleader uniforms and lipstick funny even once, but for those of you who do find this funny, is it still funny after the 40th camera shot?!?! I had to endure this garbage over and over and after every play on the field.4) Chris Rock being in only half of the movie.However, Adam Sandler is alway able to pull off being likeable, and 1/2 of Chris Rock is better than no Chris Rock at all. The action scenes were only average, but the movie succeeded in being somewhat likeable. It's a 3 star choice, but it was very close to being a ""2"", thanks to those cheerleaders."
4,"Very Funny, but Drags a Little at the End","This is a fun movie, pure and simple. Adam Sandler is his usual self and lets the other actors play off him and each other nicely. This film is loaded with WWE wrestlers, NFL players, and other people who populate ESPN & Sportscenter. The first hour or so had me laughing out loud numerous times (Chris Rock has some great lines), but it turned more serious and less fun once the final game began. After a great 3/4 of a film the final game was kind of boring. Still...this is one of the best comedies to come out this year and I'm really surprised it didn't get an R rating for quite a bit of racial humor and more than enough violence to fill five PG-13 films. ***1/2 out of *****"
1,"Predictable, Boring waste of time trash","I have to say I like Adam Sandler in some of his movies (50 first dates and Wedding Singer) and then the bad ones ( Mr.Deeds,Spanglish and more). This film is a poor effort to get good jokes, big satrs in a bad movie. The jokes are all old and used already, the acting sucked Burt Reynolds has no life and shows off like he dose in all his moives, Chris Rock is anyoing like he is in all his movies and James Cromwell tries to be the meanest guy in the world and it's funny becouse he's not. The story is predictable and pointless. Overall it was a big waste of time watching the longest yard."
2,A huge fan of Adam Sandler but....,...this is his worst effort to date in my opinion.I simply didn't find the film funny. Don't get me wrong - it wasn't especially bad. Just a bit blah! Can't recall laughing out loud at any time.Sandler's character usually connects but this time he failed to hit the spot.I'm also a big fan of Chris Rock but in films he's only as good as the lines he is given and the role here was sadly lacking. Might be an idea for Chris to stick to stand-up.
4,Funny and Great,I like the Longest Yard despite what the critics said. It had plenty of laughs and addition of Burt Reynolds who has more pivotal in this movie than the original was awesome. The teaming of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock was genius at best. The cameo of Courteney Cox was entertaining and funny.
4,Good film,"I was not sure I was going to enjoy this movie, because I am a big fan if the original, but I did. It is very similar, the humor is a little more juvenille and it is definetly a little more goofy- but what would you expect from Sandler...Overall if you like other Adam Sandler movies and the original you will like this movie! I bought after having seen it, so that says something."
3,It Wasn't Terrible (3.5 stars),"I noticed a lot of people are hostile twoards this movie and I don't see how. It was pretty humorous to me, yes the swearing and some of the jokes did make the movie lose points but hey that's an Adam Sandler comedy for you. If you look past that you can see this movie was pretty humorous and there were actors that kept this movie up. I find the plot overall interesting and the ending I rather enjoyed. It wasn't the same old cliche stuff and I liked that. It isn't the most funniest comedy I know from Sandler, but I thought it was a good one from him.I know people who have seen the older version of Longest Yard and they said, despite the swearing, it was an actual good remake of it. And from the humor I found from Sandler's version, I may just watch the older version. I give the new version though a good 3.5 stars."
1,Worthless Remake and A Total Waste of Time,"I like how Hollywierd takes great classic movies like the original ""The Longest Yard, with Burt Reynolds, and do worthless remakes with actors with zero talent like Adam Sandler. Give the public a break with rip-off movie's like this one. It was horrible!"
1,A TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT !,"In most instances the characters on this movie just recite the same lines as in the 1974 original except when Crewe unnecessarily explains his actions to his team mates. Their biggest achievements appear to be a basketball game to convince the black inmates to join them against the guards, vulgarizing the hilarious warden secretary from the original film and adding plenty of distateful jokes. Adam Sandler is his usual annoying and uncharming self and if you believe him as a pro-QB you probably beleived Burt Reynolds as ""Boss Hogg"".What a waste of celuloid !"
2,Adam Sandler pumps out another mediocre movie,"The movie the Longest Yard staring Burt Reynolds is an absolute masterpiece, a movie that didn't need any remaking. This movie, the one starring Adam Sandler is a true shame to the original. The movie could have been made better with anyone but Sandler at the helm. The inclusion of Burt Reynolds was a litter different, don't know if he should have even had a role in the remake, was good for him to score the touchdown. This movie did have some laughs but overall I don't think that I see myself ever watching the travesty that is the remake of the Longest Yard, I'm off to watch the original and remind my self as to how much this Sandler garbage ruined it.Brian Bowen"
1,Horrible Movie,"Just to start off I like Adam Sandler fan of his for years ever since SNL.With that said this is by far the worst Adam Sandler Movie ever.It's a horrible remake,lame jokes very boring.And what makes it even worst they kill Chris Rock off thats just a downer their."
2,Remake-- Mistake,"I don't know if it's the cast I didn't like or what; but it just wasn't good enough for me. The movie wasn't dark enough in a setting sense. I think a night time game would have been more engrossing and I give the casting a grade of D.The comedy angle was corny this time around as the new MEAN MACHINE does not jell as a likeable unit; as the original film did. Too many jerks in this movie, and I didn't buy Sandler as quarterback."
3,Not half bad...once you get about half way into it...,"I may not be the biggest fan on Adam Sandler but I must admit to being entertained on quite a few occasions by his films. Now I didn't even want to see this film to tell you the truth but I had free Showtime this weekend so I said ""what the heck"" and turned it on. Into the movie about ten fifteen minutes and I wasn't really impressed. Adam was pulling his same bad boy persona and the laughs where coming slow and when they came I had to force myself to laugh. Even after Chris Rock showed up I was a bit letdown since his one-liners were cliché. But about a half hour in the jokes felt funnier, the chemistry started to click and the film began to pick up. I was actually impressed by the time the credits began to roll. So, it's not a brilliant comedy by any means, and it's certainly not Sandler's best but it's a step above mediocrity and a nice diversion from a hectic day."
3,WHAT!,"Come on Dave Chapelle. You can't finish season 3 of your own show on comedy central, but you can make a movie about football? He's abviously trying to milk comedy central for every penny he can get. 3 stars for Adam Sandler. 0 stars for Dave Chapelle's greed!"
2,You're Supposed to Laugh Because Our Research Says It's Funny!,"Somehow it feels forced. As forced as all of these ""Happy-Madison"" productions. I never bothered with the original adaption of this film, but it's probably better.I grow tired of Sandler playing the tough but nice guy. I grow tired of Chris Rock's big-toothed grin and ""crazy"" exclamations.Same old prison jokes...so on and so forth.It DOES have a few funny scenes, though. But nothing ""laugh out loud"". If you're a football fan you may enjoy it, but I'm not gonna' guarantee it.FINAL VERDICT:RENT. Once."
2,ehh... I could make a better home movie.,"Lets start out with the begining. Everyones at this banging party. Except for our rebal friend. Crewe is drinking beer while watching the latest episode of Sabrina the teenage witch. When his wife comes in and asks him to lock her in a closet.(strange lady). Then he goes and makes fun of a cops ears and gets busted. Ends up in a jail in the middle of nowhere and then gets raped by bisexual guards. Then he has to make a football team or the warden will read his mail. His team is messed up first of all. A crazy giant who screams and plays pingpong by himself. The qb that eats popcorn all the time so his hands are oily. A huge black guy with an iq of 1. And the buff guy who hides large objects in his pants, so he can feel tough. Oh and this caretaker guy who likes to hide shoes in cake. Long-stories short this is a rent in my book. (I recomende the pest. great movie.)"
3,Okay movie but not Adam Sandler's best,"The Longest Yard has its good points and bad points. It just didn't thrill me as much as other Adam Sandler movies. There were some few laughs but parents might not appreciate the transsexual inmates and the lewd sex jokes made. There is also a scene with steriod abuse that parents might not be keen about. It was a surprise to see all the pro wrestlers in it: Steve Austin, Kevin Nash, Bill Goldberg and NFL football players Michael Irvin and Bill Romanowski playing both players and guards. This was funny enough but not as funny as 50 First Dates and the ending left you guessing. Those two factors kept me from giving it 5 stars. I'd rent it but I don't know if I'd buy it."
4,Definitely some funny moments,IF you like Adam Sandler movies you will find this is a good watch. I liked the original Longest Yard but my 2 teenage boys wanted to see this version. I am a huge fan of Happy Gilmore but never saw this film because I had been duped by several other Adam Sandler movies. My boys thought it was hilarious and I did too at times. Worth a rent.
4,"Loved the Movie, saw it twice",I'm def. going to buy this movie when it's released on dvd. I went to the movies two different times and saw it.
1,LIMP REMAKE WHATS THE POINT?,"First off, I am an big Adam Sandler fan,but this movie is really lame. The original Film is a classic. How do you screw this up? When I first heard about this film I was ready for something funny like ""The Water Boy"" that movie was hilarious and I think Sandler should have taken a good look at it again before doing this one. This film is not even worth a look."
5,Great movie makes a great gift.,"I bought this movie as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. I knew he loved the movie and wanted to add it to his rather large collection of DVDs because he kept repeating the phrase ""Will you teach me to football?"" every five minutes. The movie was only eight dollars and it arrived within two days thanks to Amazon Prime.I don't usually watch football movies but he really wanted to watch it the moment he opened it. However, this movie was absolutely hilarious. It was definitely more of a comedy than anything. I think it's one of Adam Sandler's best!"
4,Hilarious!,"Adam Sandler was great as always! He sure knows how to perk up everyone and make them smile, even on a bad day. I went to the store to look for something that was suitable for my brother-in-law and something that my sister and I would like also, which was not an easy decision. I decided to get this one, it was about football, but it wasn't too rough and tough that we ladies wouldn't like it. So get the movie, pop some popcorn, sit down and enjoy with that significant other."
4,"Not Bad, but Not Great either","The Longest Yard brings to the screen the story of a former football player who ends up in jail serving a three-year sentence. Things get a bit more complicated when the warden wants him to coach a team of inmates in an upcoming game against the prison guards...Adam Sandler, Burt Reynolds, Courteney Cox, and the rest of the cast carry out their roles well, though by no means are these their best performances.The plot is actually not unique (there have been enough football movies), nevertheless, it is quite pleasant.In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it. 3 Stars"
4,The Longest Yard (Full Screen Edition),"Paul ""Wrecking"" Crewe was a revered football superstar back in his day, but that time has since faded. But when a messy drunk driving incident lands him in jail, Paul finds he was specifically requested by Warden Hazen, a duplicitous prison official well aware of Paul's athletic skills. Paul has been assigned the task of assembling a team of convicts, to square off in a big football game against the sadistic guards. With the help of fellow convict Caretaker, and an old legend named Nate Scarborough to coach, Crewe is ready for what promises to be a very interesting game. It's only the warden and the guards who have no idea who or what they're up against, with Paul the driving force behind the new team. A good comedy worth seeing. Especially if you are a Sandler fan."
1,See the Original!!,"Why mess with perfection? Would ""The Good,the Bad and the Ugly"" be better if the film was updated with some more current talent?""The Longest Yard"" from the 70's is a first rate football/prison flick about disgraced QB Paul Crewes trying protect himself and then do right after landing in prison for a few years.The remake is a pointless update, and if seen in context of the original, it is in excercise in nothing but capitalist exploitation and the ""repackage-all-that-sells"" attitude of Hollywood. Adam Sandler is capable of good comedy, but does not have the football background Burt Reynolds had to make credible. Chris Rock and Nelly are tiresome and a predictable reach to crossover to the BET and Hip-Hop crowd. The first try wasn't without humor, but also showed a very serious side to life in stir. The remake is all laughs and ""don't drop the soap"" jokes.The first ""Longest Yard"" was a film, this ""Longest Yard"" is a PRODUCT."
1,The Longest Yard,"This is a Horrible movie. Do not see it. It may seem impossible to make a bad comedy with Chris Rock and Adam Sandler but believe me it is. This movie is almost as bad as Garfield, the movie."
2,nothing special here.,"I can't believe people are giving this five stars. An excessive portion of this movie is devoted to the football game, and it just gets repetitive and boring. The laughs are few and the classic Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison esque humor is not intact. Some of the scenes in this movie are so unrealistic that I wanted to vomit. Like the scene when steve austin shoots that gun, and the pellets ricochet across the room for an unreasonable amount of time. Also, Adam Sandler's reckless behavior that gets him arrested was not very realistic either. The deficit of humor in this one solidifies my negative assessment. Stick to a good Adam Sandler movie."
4,Pretty good with a wierd ending???,"About 40 minutes into it all the players, past and present, came together then it took off with Cruz as the love interest of both the rich guy and the producer. But then the movie slowed down for me at the end with the re-shooting of Mateo's botched film. That scene felt off-key compared to the vibe of the rest of the movie. It was like a comedy sketch tacked on the end of a drama/thriller. Wierd. That ending could have been left off with the movie concluding shortly after showing how Mateo got blind and the ""confession"" of his assistant."
4,"New story, same old cast & director","I liked the story, but everything else was predictable & stale.relationships, jealousy, pretty women, homosexualityLife goes on."
5,Worth while every time that you watch it.,"This movie is not a typical movie for an American audience, but it is so rich, and so moving, that you feel like you become part of the story. All the characters are believable, and after five minutes, you forget that you are dealing with those nasty little sub-titles.It is both sexual and sensual, and yet has a depth that forces thought.Broken Embraces was on my top five movie list for 2009, and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a well told story."
2,Disappointing,"I was surprised at how disappointed I was with this movie. I like Almodovar's movies quite a bit but the freshness of energy and the unexpected turns of events were missing I thought. To make matters worse, it seemed like Penelope Cruz, who I also like and though was great in Volver, nearly prostitutes herself in this role. I may be getting old but I'm not that anxious to see her doing sex scenes and appearing half nude. Come on, Pedro, give us something a great director is worthy of."
1,"Not worth renting, let alone buying","I enjoyed Volver so I gave Broken Embraces a chance & rented it one night. It was such an awful, long, POS to sit through. Bad characters, bad writing, bad casting, just BAD."
1,it is worthless,"Piece of junk, it had a hole in it and piss went all over the bed. Do not recommend to anyone."
2,Be sure this is the latest edition available,"This is an excellent grammar, but beware which edition you purchase. Curme's latest is copyrighted 1922 and appears in various later printings. This seems to be what's contained in the Cornell Library edition. However, some editions on offer on Amazon seem to be printings of the earlier, 1904 edition. You are probably better off with the revised and enlarged 1922 edition instead; it's sloppy of a publisher to offer only the older edition, when the newer is also in the public domain."
3,Lacking in a Couple Areas,"This is a very versatile product. Once setup is complete, it folds up with one pull into a size small enough to fit into the supplied travel bag that in turn can be quickly thrown into a car trunk. Pretty sturdy design (not rickety/shaky). One drawback we've found so far is the basinette bottom (which is a wood or particle-board piece) slides to one side, causing an unlevel surface for changing. This is a minor irritation that could be solved by sewing a strip on one side so that the wood can't slide. The other drawback is that the supplied carousel is wind-up, but only lasts a short time so the parent ends up winding it every couple minutes. The last drawback is small, but the travel bag requires the folded-up playard to slide into the bag rather than zippered in (R&D; oversight). Overall, good buy for the money, just needs a couple customer tweaks if you have OCD like we do!BTW, we have the ""Brentwood"" design."
4,Graco Bassinette,"I consider this playard a good buy. It was easy to set up, although the directions could be confusing, as they were written for several model options and could not necessarily be followed sequentially. However, once figured out, the playard was very easy to assemble and adapt to multiple uses. Caution, the width is larger than most of the door entrances in my house, so if moving from room-to-room it may be necessary to partially disassemble. The purchase and delivery system through Amazon was outstanding."
4,Handy & a bargain but not as sturdy as I'd have liked,"It's a bargain to be sure because it has many features you can use over time as the baby grows, but you get what you pay for. The bassinet feature is not nearly as firm and secure as one would think or hope. The ""bassinet"" is the cushioned pad for the bottom of the playard that you fasten at a higher level, so you can use it as a bed for your newborn infant. When in the bassinet arrangement it sags VERY easily. There's simply not enough support underneath it. Past the point the baby is 10 pounds it gets very saggy and warped, in our experience. If you want to have your baby sleep in your room longer than a couple months then I'd recommend putting a real, actual crib in your room or a proper bassinet crib."
1,Not useful at all,"This pack-n-play does not fit through doorways...so you have to disassemble it every time you move it. I can't believe no one commented on that fact. Unless I just have unusually sized doorways? (I think they're pretty standard). The bag it comes in doesn't have handles, so you have to put it in another larger duffle bag of your own if you want to actually travel with it. The mattress isn't comfortable and sags with my 11 pound infant on it. I'm very disappointed with it. Way too bulky and heavy to travel on airplane anywhere. I am going to invest in a smaller, lighter, travel infant bed instead."
4,Good quality,"Has lasted through 2 grandbabies. Good quality, takes some practice to set up and take down, but nice to have this available at my house when the kids visit"
3,Okay except for changing table,"fold up very easily, but the changing table part is only supported on one side and has bent by 6 weeks, so the little one slides over to one side. also, the changing part is too low if you're even a little tall."
4,control of quality and service,"it is of good quality, I am very contented with the product, although deberia to bring the mosquito netting"
1,playyard,This item was never received. I was notified that it could not be located one month after my order.
1,piece of junk,"if you like to sleep your baby in a Wok, then get this playard. the mattress sags and sinks in the center to form a hole. The mattress pad consists of 4 boards and they are supported by 2 small metal rods from the bottom on both sides to keep it straight and prevent it from sagging, but the rods are too short and they only covers the 2 middles board of the mattress, and the other 2 boards on each extremities raises upward and make the whole mattress look like a wok. my baby was 5 lbs when she was born and she hated sleeping in this playard and still hating it until now (she is 11 lbs now). Everyone who comes for visit look at the playard and ask the same question: who is the idiot who designed this mattress? All what it takes is a longer rods to cover and support the whole mattress, and not only 50% of it"
4,Good - but change table needs to be levelled.,"Overall a pretty good product. However, I do have a few complaints. The mobile is garbage and just gets in the way - we threw it away. The change table slants to one side and causes the baby to roll. It is, however, compact when stripped down and isn't bad for the price. The side caddy is very handy for diapers and wipes."
2,Buy a different one- one with an electric mobile,"I got this pack and play for my second child, a girl. It is fine but has many flaws. For the early months, you have to bend over too far to change the diaper so I would recommend paying extra for a bigger higher one. Also the diaper changer tilts to one side and did so since she came home at only 6lbs! She would roll to the side with every diaper change which was really annoying. Lastly, the mobile is useless. It would have been great to have an electric one so she could listen to the music and watch it. Who in their right mind has the time to stand there and push the mobile by hand? Not me! I would buy a different one."
3,Just as good,Well when I wasnt stabbing myself with the manual. It was very easy to put together. I think it could use more cushion for the baby and the wheels dont move that freely. Other wise it was the best for the money.
3,Good but mobile and sound device are a disaster,"This playard is good like all the Pack and Play basic playards. It folds relatively easily and the wheels are convenient to move it from one room to the other. I really like the attachment that stores diapers,cream, wipes (in a small case) and pacifiers. Some models don't have this attachment which is really useful. But I didn't like the mobile nor the sound device. The bears are too pale and it doesn't have any music or movement. My daughter didn't like it at all. The sounds and light device is another disaster because the light is too low and you almost can't hear the music (I just put it away). I have the Winnie the Pooh playard and its mobile is much better although it doesn't have a space to store anything."
2,TCP CFLB Has a Short Life,I got the 5100k bulb which has lasted for less than 2yrs with minimal on-time. Otherwise a good bulb. Will not save money with this short of a life.
4,Solid speakers at a great price,"We had just moved and our new house has a much bigger room where the home theater system was going so I knew my old ""mini cube"" rear channel speakers were just too small. I saw these and thought I would give them a try, at least as a short term fix. They sound great, and I now have no plans on replacing them! The bass is not fantastic, but that is what my sub-woofer is for. I have them mounted about 11' off the floor at a down angle. I will be buying more as both high front 7.1 speakers and to mount on the lanai by the pool. They are very hard to beat for the price.Update:I ended up getting the 2nd pair of these and mounted them on the underside of our 2nd floor porch that overlooks the pool area. I connected them with 16 gauge wire to a Pyle Mini 2x75W Stereo Power Amplifier. Mounting them near the wooden 2nd floor porch enhanced the bass. They sound very nice, and deliver great sound across the lanai and whole back yard."
5,The best for under $30,These are some pretty good lil speakers!! Yes they dont shake the walls with bass but they mount to the wall with ease took me ten min to mount mine. They are great for my surround sound!! Would be great for yours too!!
5,Great value for the money,I wanted some front speakers for my boat but didn't want to invest a lot of money. These BIC indoor/outdoor speakers were a perfect fit in the little cubby area on each side of the bow and they sound much more expensive than they are. I have some Polk DB 651 marine speakers in the back which are very nice and the BIC's can definitely hold their own with the Polks. I couldn't ask for nicer speakers for the less than $25 (shipped) that I paid.
4,Good Speakers,"Bought four of these, hooked it into a Yamaha RX-V371 receiver. Sound is intense, I use them as HTPC speakers. I'm satisfied.I tried to register them with BicAmerica, they state they don't do registrations anymore. If I ever have a problem with them just show them the receipt and they replace it. Simple, honest guarantee.I've only had these for a couple of months now, and unfortunately with life being what it is these days, I don't have a lot of time to use the products I've bought. But someday, I may update this review, and hopefully, I'll still have good thing to say."
4,A good buy,"These speakers are very solidly constructed; they are heavier than I would have imagined for such small units. One of the other reviewers said these speakers are ""tinny"", and to some extent, I agree. They are short on bass response (they are not ported), but they make up for it with clear, crisp highs and good mids. I intended to use these as my surround-back speakers, but for the time being I will continue to employ my bass-reflex KLH BTF-220's for this task. I think with time these could warm up nicely, and they would likely work very well on my patio. At this price, it's not worth it to me to return them; I'll keep them for future use."
4,Can't beat the price.....,"Good sound for the price, clear mid range and highs, but don't expect any bass out of these..."
2,tinny sounding,"These speakers do create sound, but when compared to my mitsubishi speakers from 1984, they sound very tinny and hollow. the sound is not rich and not very pleasant to listen to if you're used to something better."
1,Wish I could give no stars for the rating.....,"This video is worth, at most, $5.99, and NOT $30.00. Seriously, it's a poorly filmed, poorly edited copy of this woman teaching a class of children and elderly in 1989. She does not even dance to the standard songs that the dances go with! I wish I could return this disc."
5,A MUST HAVE!,"This DVD is a blast and a big hit with kids... as well as adults! I am a K- 5 dance teacher with the Los Angeles Unified Schoold District. Christy Lane gives step by step instructions and makes it easy to learn the moves. Whether we're learning the Chicken Dance, Hand Jive, or The Swing, the kids are loving it!"
4,Larger and heavier than I thought,"These are quite large (the circle part is the size of a penny) and heavier than I like my earrings - my fault since I never made the conversion to metric. That said, I still like them and will wear them."
2,Softcore version,"It doesn't state in the description that this is the softcore version. Might be good for couples who are virgins and have never viewed adult videos. But not enough ""spice"" for seasoned couples."
3,DVD ok,"This is DVD, I would expect to watch on HBO, Showtime, or Cinemax. I was expecting to see more of the private parts. They kept everything covered."
5,Uno de los mejores ensayos sobre la tragedia,"Se trata de un brillante y riguroso estudio sobre el complejo género de la tragedia. Es realmente notable la claridad, la erudición y la amplitud de la información presentada por el autor. Este libro resulta una guía luminosa para comprender la tragedia. Resulta además muy bien escrito (la traducción al español publicada por Seix Barral en 1978 es también excelente). Desde Platón y Aristóteles (de quien examina algunos de los términos más importantes expuestos en La Poética), hasta Nietzche y Sartre este ensayo enriquece en cada página nuestra comprensión de la tragedia, no solo como género literario y dramático sino como visión de la realidad. Un espléndido trabajo."
1,THE PICTURE IS NOT THE PRODUCT,"I have tripple checked the model number and the picture provided, IS NOT THE PRODUCT!!!The product is not two moduels to fit two DIMM's, This modle ""KVR533D2N24/512, has only ONE STICK!Second the restocking and return policy from Tiger Direct will cost you an additional $21 after shipping and restocking and only get you store credit toward a more expensive version of this RAM to fit two DIMM'sIF you are looking for RAM fro two DIMM's to have DDR2 function as DDR2, THIS IS NOT A BUY FOR YOU!(note this RAM will fit one DIMM and function as 512MB but not with the DDR2 benefits)"
1,"Kogi 17"" LCD",Very poor quality product - in the TV mode the unit was not worth watching. I returned it the day I received it. Don't waste your time or money.
1,not user friendly,It's complicated to use this LCD monitor/tv. It's TV tuner to receive channels is very bad and it's instruction to correct the situation is non-existence.
5,Best Bedrail,Love this bedrail. Easily folds down for making the bed and appears to be extra strong! The twins are starting to climb over it into bed and it has held up great!
2,It functions but the instructions are awful.,"As a mechanical engineer, I'm reasonably adept at putting things together. As a guy, I hate having to look at assembly instructions. But I had to look at the instructions for this thing, because assembly wasn't looking so intuitive. And that is when I found the worst instructions ever provided for a consumer product. All they would have had to do to make the instructions work is hire an illustrator for a day to make some drawings. If you took 10 people off of the street, gave this bed rail and the instructions and put them in locked rooms such that they couldn't come out until they were properly assembled and installed, archeologists would be later digging up their bones."
3,A question,"This is not really a review but a question to those that have purchased this. Someone mentioned that the maker of this is Dex Products. And that you can find it in Walmart under ""Parents Choice"". I couldnt find it. But I did find the ""Safe Sleeper Bed Rail"" which is by Dex products. Is this the same product everyone is talking about that is rated great? I just want to be sure I am purchasing the same one that got the good ratings. I went to [...] and the only bed rail they have on their website was the ""safe sleeper"". Please advise if anyone could. Thanks."
3,dimensions,Is there anybody who could tell me the dimensions of this item packed or unpacked? I will have somebody to bring it to me overseas and trying to find out if it would fit into a suitcase.Thanks
2,need box spring,My daughters bed does not have a box spring so we could not use this product. Unfortunately I didn't know it was necessary until after I purchased the product. I was very dissappointed that this would not work.
1,"BEWARE, This bedrail could hurt your child.","I purchased this bedrail last week and everything looked good until last night. My daughter sat up in bad and then fell backwards onto the edge of her pillow. She cracked her head on the SQUARE corner of this bedrail. Why would you put a SQUARE, METAL tube near a toddler's head. I quickly returned this product for the Safety First bedrail that folds down."
4,Instuctions need to be improved,"I bought 2 of these rails (in white) and the instructions do say to be used with a matress & boxspring. I had to use commonsense to install it since the instructions are of no real help. We have a twin size bed with a high matress for our 2 yrs. The square bar is just below the top of the matress so that it does not touch her when she's sleeping. She's been taking her naps in her bed and no roll overs or falling out. So far so good. The only con is the instructions. It does not say how to fold it down. I got it by looking at the image. When you have the lower bar set to unlock,each of the hidged bars have arrows on it. Pull them up at the same time and voila! it folds down! Sorry if my comment is long but I want to give out as much info for those who are thinking about buying it, especially those that cannot figure out how to fold it down."
4,Bedrail Review,"We are pleased with this itme. It has enabled our 19 month old Granddaughter to enjoy her sleep over times at Grandma's house in a ""grown-up"" bed. The first time she slept in the twin bed in our spare room with the bedrails she fell asleep right away and slept through the night. I had peace of mind knowing that she was ""safe""."
1,Will be returned,"I just bought this bed rail a few hours ago. The instructions could have been better written. And pictures could have been helpful since the instructions suck. But the thing that bothers me the most is that it doesn't state on the box that he can only be used on mattresses with box springs(which my daughters bed does not have) and i didn't like that there was a metal bar in the center of it. And like another reviewer stated there is no instructions on how to lower it in the fold position. It was completely unusable to me. SO if your child has a toddler bed, a bunk bed mattress, or any other bed without a boxspring or that is thinner than a usual bed then beware its not for you."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very excited to find this product. It got mostly good reviews and looked to be the perfect thing for my son's bed. So I bought it...big mistake.First off, it does not tell you on the information page that this rail system should be used on a bed with a mattress and box spring. My son has a captain's bed, therefore, no box spring. Secondly, the directions are not properly illustrated and leave out a vital piece of information until the END of the instruction page. (This being that the 'pocket' for the square tube must face inward towards the mattress) I had the whole thing assembled (wrong, of course) before discovering this valuable bit of information.Lastly, they provide NO instructions on how to fold the rail down. I still have no idea how to do that, not that I can because that function doesn't work on my son's rails since he has no box spring.I am very disappointed. Hopefully my review will serve as a warning to those thinking of purchasing this item."
3,Shaky,"The product hasn't fallen off or anything, but compared to my still intact side view mirror, it shakes around a LOT. Just the road jitter causes it in everyday driving; I'm guessing either the glue it came with isn't very good or I broke some kind of stabilizer as well.But it fit, and it works, and the jitter isn't going to blind me if I need to see behind me."
2,From a client's point of view,"This seems to me to be a pretty standard exposition of how to choose a therapist. It may work for an average client. The author agrees that therapists are different in their success with therapy, but as with many another on the topic does not really know why. What does one therapist do in therapy that another does not? Why does one therapist actively listen, immediately aware of his or her own thoughts and feelings during a session and able to make use of this awareness, and another just goes on ""instinct"" without being particularly self-aware? This can be the crucial difference in therapy. It allows a therapist to let a client be entirely separate from the therapist, and lets him or herself hear the experience of the client, an experience which may be very much more extreme than the average person's -- and this factor is almost never discussed."
5,One of my favorite CDs,"This CD is wonderful!! I happened to check out her website and ordered it based on what I saw and heard on it. Check out her new CD, Wind Chains, coming out soon!!!"
3,Good Coffee table book,"This book has entrancing photos, and skips through a large number of countries and studs. If you are looking for in depth information on Arabians in any particulary part of the world this book is not for you. It looks at selected studs only. If you want lovely pictures you wont be unhappy."
4,makes the rounds around the bookstore,"Woring in a bookstore, this book about 3 amazing-looking guys makes it rounds around the bookstore."
5,"Outstanding Photos - Erotic, sensitive, and brilliant!","Howard Roffman captures the true essence of a loving 3-way relationship. Although unconventional by many standards - in both the gay and straight world, the beauty of the loving relationship between, John, Gary, and Kris is 'brought to life' through the lens of Howard Roffman."
5,Book Description,"Starring in Howard Roffman's photo book ""Three"" are three young men: John, Gary and Kris. They live together in a quite unconventional relationship in London. Roffman's photos show scenes from their everyday life - tender moments and even sexually heated situations. But Roffman's models do not remain ""just models"". With each picture the three protagonists get more and more lively. And each of them tells his own life story."
5,Excellent Value,"If you are a fan of Howard Roffman than this book will not dissapoint. If you purchase and like it, I recommend purchasing the compainion DVD called ""Three"". They go good together and add insite into the lives of these young men."
5,Best Discription of Life Going West,"I love this kind of reading, my daughter gave me vol.2 as a Christmas gift, I read it in just a few days, had I had the time I would have read it in 1 day. The book is very hard to put down once you start reading it. I love the way the diarys are written in simple english and discripe the life and hardship these women survied crossing the country in a very young wild time. This is a must read book."
2,TOO MUCH COMPRESSION!!!,"I haven't heard this album in 33 years and brings back memories when I was a kid and bought it on vinyl. I still remember every song and every word and don't know how you categorize this release however I think it's a classic. I would give this release 4 stars however my review is based on the remastering from according to the record label ""Original Masters"". I listen to my music on a full stereo set up with pro speakers and this edition sounds awful! Sounds too compressed and the separation and mix of the instruments needs some serious improvements. This also sounds very thin and could use some extra bass. The only part of this release that sounds good is the vocals however I hope the next edition will be a ""Deluxe"" version with outtakes and maybe some live tracks and the main improvement, a better mastering job!"
4,A rather interesting reminder of the 70's...and 90's.,Come on... how many teen-agers have not experienced a[n] [emotional] time when life was just so...much? So vast... and mysterious? Meat Loaf takes life and delivers - nice and neatly (and musically). So what if it doesn't appeal to everyone!
4,For crying out loud!,"Made in USA in 2001, Serial# CK-62171, Playing Time 61:59What can be said about an album that sold over 25 million copies? Some people like it!Kidding aside, this expanded edition contains 2 additional tracks not on the original release: ""Bolero"", which is the band's warm-up track before ML gets on stage, and a live rendition of ""BOOH"" (that's the acronym of the song) recorded in Long Island back in 1978.Too bad they put any more; there's room left, and they could have included some material from the BBC Rock Hour recorded at London's Hamersmith Odeon that same year..."
5,I can't get enough of this one. I live it myself.,"You've just got to jump in with the artist doing the music. You be part of it, just sing along and look at your lover-get involved. Its the best of the 70's. Every track is great."
4,"Yes it's stuck in the 70s,but SO WHAT?","It's all bombast and cheese,but it's full of EMOTION,something today's music is seriously lacking.The members of The E Street Band who appear on this album came darn close to repeating the beautiful music they made on Bruce's second album,and louder is always better.Todd Rundgren is the real mastermind here,each instrument is recorded at just the right level,never forgetting that Mr. Loaf is the focal point of the cheesefest.Is this the same Ellen Foley that was on Night Court with Harry Andersen and Richard Moll? And does anybody have the PICTURE DISC version?"
1,NO!,"Good heavens, are people still falling for this crap?This junk sounded horrible back in the 70's and, as astonishing as it seems, sounds even worse today."
1,One of a kind? THANK GOD!,"Actually, this isn't true. This album's sequel, the oh so cleverly titled ""Bat Out of Hell II"" is just like this one making them two of a kind. But anyhow, they both are pretty bad. Laughable in one sense, but hardly in the same league as the albums the previous reviewer lists."
1,Don't waste your $$$,"DO NOT BUY THIS CD. I have never written an online review on any product before but I felt compelled to write one on this CD:I was excited to get Meatloaf's ""remastered"" ""Bat Out of Hell"" in the mail but when I played it the first time I was sorely disappointed. I have heard this music in it's original form many times, and it is amazing, but this remastered version seems to have upped the bass element to a point that I developed listener fatigue halfway through the first (title) cut. I tried adjusting the bass on my stereo (yes a real stereo, not an I-home or Bose) but along with bringing the bass in line it destroyed the rich tones of Meatloaf's vocals.My next purchase will be the same album only from a used un-remastered 1980's CD (if such a thing exists) or to dig out the old turntable and buy a 1970's vinyl version at a rummage sale and hope it's not too scratched up. It's sad state of affairs!"
1,Oh my.,"The 70's produced a lot of horrid music and this is a shining example. I read people here calling this ""classic"". That makes me wonder if eithe A)the definition of the word has changed or B) the stats about increased drug abuse by Americans are indeed true. This an overproduced silly and dated sounding mish mash of violins and bad guitar playing. The lyrics are utterly forgettable as well. This disc can usually be found as a super saver for $9.99. Take your 9.99 and go see a good movie. This is a waste of time and money, even the cover is stupid...."
1,Don't get it,"I was in high school when this album was released. I didn't get it then, and I don't get it now. I've tried, mind you. I had a roommate in college who loved this thing and I honestly let him try and explain to me how he could possibly like this stuff which was off too over the top for me. There have been many albums I did not like when there were first released but later ended up liking. We just agreed to disagree.Anyway, I guess I should be appalled that at this day in age there are still people who think of this as classic stuff, but by and large I just shake my head in disbelief. To each his (or her) own, I suppose, but for me, 21 years after its release I still don't get it."
1,Grateful,"As much as I dispise this album (and believe me - I LOATH IT) I am actually grateful to it. So desperate was I for alternative back in 1978 (when this was everywhere) I went looking and discovered The Clash, The Rammones, and others."
1,No good,"This has got to be one of the stupidest and most pompous albums ever recorded. It has everything to do with pomposity, and NOTHING to do with rock and roll."
2,Perversly fascinating,"There is something almost perversely fascinating about ""Bat Out of Hell."" It isn't very good music. In fact it is mostly pretty horrid. Yet it is almost a situation in which it is so bad that one can't stop listening to it. There is the occasional listenable melody, the always painfully overwrought lyrics, and the embarrassingly overblown production. Somehow it all adds up for the perfect music for masochists."
5,Awesome creative genius!,Oh whee. Parking on the backroad of Wisconsin...in the '70's...brings me back. I grew up (and up) with Meatloaf.
5,Meatloaf will live on forever!!!,"Meatloaf is an excellent singer who sings from his heart. I have to hand it to him on his ""crash diet"". It certainly didn't affect his voice. If anyone saw him on VH1's ""Storytellers"", they would know what I mean."
5,One of my all time favorites.,"I have had this album in various styles for years,with the great price on amazon I added it to my tablet.Great album!"
5,Top CD,"One of the top albums that is a must have for all music lovers out there. All songs written by Jim Steinman, master of songwriting in my opinion."
2,CONFOUNDING,"I think people confuse this below average sacrafice with the well above average Performance Video. So much of this work depends on visual cues, it loses a lot when only listened to. I would rank the video 4or5 stars, but the audio submission is weak and tiny. LINER NOTE: @ my friend's first wedding she played ""Two Out of Three Ain't Bad"", and at her next wedding she played, ""One, Two, Three Times a Lady""...and that jerk was clueless to what was coming next!"
5,Great Stuff!!!,"Meat Loaf's ""i would do anything for love, but i won't do that"" is the best song ever!!! the effort he puts into his songs are really great!!! Great album!!!"
1,"Really, really, REALLY bad!","It is difficult to imagine a more painful reminder of the late 1970's than this album. Barry Manilow? Disco? Maybe. But unlike Meat Loaf (now there's a charming stage name for you) those other blights on good taste never really made any claims at being anything more than superficial sounds for the polyester era, whereas this album was clearly a woeful attempt at making great ""art.""But it should be apparent from the outset that this project was doomed to fail. I mean just look at that horrid cover art. It is so ugly that hurts the just eyes to look at it. But never judge a book by its cover, they say, and they same should apply to albums.Unfortunately this is NOT the album to prove that point. Everything here is overblown, pretentious, and just plan awful. Maybe it is unfair to judge it from a nearly quarter of a century later perspective, but the bottom line is that this doesn't even work as camp or 70's nostalgia. Its THAT bad!"
1,Horrid,"The continuing success of this bloated, grandiose junk is one of the saddest stories in the history of music. The songs are simply dreadful with some of them (most notable ""Paradise by the Dashboard Lights"") ranking among the worst songs ever. Let's not pull any punches folks, this album is deeply anti-rock and roll to its very core."
5,A remarkable album!,"It's been nearly a quarter century since this album was released, and still I can listen to it for hours without tiring of it. The early criticism was that it didn't fit with the music of the day. I think that's why it stands today as such a great album. The Meatloaf/Jim Steinman collaboration is one borne of the love that each had for theatrics. This album is best when it soars to new heights that few have dared climb. Almost operatic in nature, yet very sexual in context, ""Bat Out of Hell"" combined genres with ease. There is not a bad track on this album. Best are the title track and ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light."""
4,Ridiculous and Sublime,"There have been a lot of conflicting things said about Bat Out Of Hell over the years, sometimes from the same source. The review in the All Music Guide uses the word ""silly"""" four times and ""ridiculous"" twice--while giving it five stars, its highest rating. I think that pretty much says it all; just a couple of questions I'd add:Am I the only one who thinks All Revved Up With No Place To Go is far and away the best song on the album? It doesn't seem to get mentioned much, but to me it's four minutes of pure excitement.Do other people skip Heaven Can Wait? To my ears, mellow Meatloaf is kind of like decaf coffee or non-alcoholic beer--what's the point?The rest is pretty much fun ear candy if you're in the mood."
5,Meat Loaf Re Mastered CD,My old CD of MeatLoaf Bat Out of Hell was worn out. This is even better than the original and the additional live performance from New Jersey was awesome. I'm very pleased! And the price was right.
5,"""Bat Out Of Hell"" is excellent!","""Bat Out Of Hell"" is excellent! This is an excellent beginning to Meat Loaf's ""Bat Out Of Hell"" trilogy.Track Listing1. Bat Out Of Hell2. You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night)3. Heaven Can Wait4. All Revved Up With No Place To Go5. Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad6. Paradise By The Dashboard Light: Paradise/Let Me Sleep On It/Praying For the End Of Time7. For Crying Out Loud8. Bonus Track: Great Boleros Of Fire (Live Intro)9. Bonus Track: Bat Out Of Hell (Live)"
5,Great Service,So I going through a MEATLOAF phase right now and was very eager to get this cd. The shipping was very fast and the product was good as new. Very please with this purchase.
5,Great memories of these songs,"Listening to these songs brought back a lot of great memories from high school days! Perfect for the lazy afternoon just lounging, listening, and dreaming....."
3,Questionable sound quality,"What isn't questionable is the status of this album as a classic, and for good reason. However, the sound quality of these tracks leave a lot to be desired. It's noticeable even to an untrained ear at louder volumes. Sound quality is one-star, timelessness of these songs, five-stars."
5,This is THE all time greatest rock album!!!,"I am a big dance music listener and I listen to very little classic rock, but this CD rocks! It is the ultimate rock CD of all time, and it always will be!!! I'd give it 6 stars but it won't let you..."
5,Ultimate Rock Record,"Well i agree with the previous review except for the part about ""sitting"" and listening to this album. I cant imagine myself sitting to this. The music is so powerful and pumped up you have to get up, and become a rock star for about an hour! It kicks off with the 10 minute Bat out of Hall which in my opnion is the ultimate rock song of all time. Other highlights are You took the Words right OUt of My Mouth, Heaven Can Wait, the 13 minute duet, Paradise By the Dashboard Light, and his biggest hit from the Bat out Of Hell 1, Two Out Of Three Aint Bad. If you truly feel that you are rock n roll then u must have this album. And if you dont think your rock no roll, you will be after you listen to this!"
1,I Agree,I almost agree with Chapel Hill. Except I knew this stuff was bad when I heard it 25 years ago...
1,Is this rock n roll or a Broadway show?,"Don't get me wrong Meatloaf fans. I have nothing personal against you, your music, or the artist who performs it. I'm sure Mr. Loaf is a fine, outstanding citizen that anybody would admire in person, but as for the style of music he performs? Attrocious! These bombastic, over the top, pseudo opera epics sound more like a Broadway musical than rock n roll. The songs are boring and tell long winded stories with involved plots. The production is over the top and bombastic. Meatloaf took everything to the extreme and the result was one of the most pretentious albums ever made."
1,torture,"This is over the top and overly precious in every way. If you like musicals and don't like rock, this might be your album to buy so you can think (incorrectly), ""Oooh, I'm a rocker, too."" Other than that, run away. This is a high-school theatre version of Big Rock."
1,The reason people laugh at the 70's,This is one of the reason people laugh about the 1970's. If you want some decent music from that era skip over this and stick with The Clash.
1,Still?,"Why, here at the dawn of the 21st century, are there still people who think this tripe is hip?Get with it people. The 70's are over, and this is one of the main reasons why we should all be grateful."
1,Ick!,"The worst the 70's had to offer, this is some of the most pretentious claptrap ever recorded. That this album has sold in the millions proves right the idea that nobody has ever gone broke underestimating the taste of the American public."
1,No!,"Overwrought, over sung and woefully overproduced, ""Bat Out of Hell"" represents some of the worst overindulgence in excess that still give the 70's a bad name. It was junk like this that at least allowed punk to happen. So maybe it is not a total dud, but at this day in age it should warrant interest only as a cultural relic of a most wretched period in American pop culture."
1,"Dreadful, utterly dreadful","This is, quite possibly, some of THE most dreadful ""music"" ever recorded. Bombastic, ovverblown, and completetly horiffic, it is ""music"" like this that calls into question if the first amendment should even exist."
4,If you own the sequel get the first Bat too.,"This is better than Bat Out Of Hell 2 and more enjoyable. Its one of my favorite albums which is sort of odd because I dont even listen to this style of music very often. Like movies, the first Bat Out Of Hell will make the second one make more sense. So if youre looking for a good way to spend 20 dollars buy this album and a bacon cheeseburger plus a large frosty at Wendy's."
5,one of the best books on comparative religion,a comparision of eastern religions and their influence on western thought
5,It's all Greek to me.,Truly the only textbook for anyone wishing to learn New Testament Greek.Please make sure you also buy the answer book! Without it the textbook is very limited indeed.
4,Good book,"This book is a nice account of the catastrophic event that wiped out the dinosaurs. I would give the book a rating of 5, but there is a wonderful 15 page narration of the event in the book ""The Bible According to Einstein"" that covers 90% of what is contained in ""T.rex and the Crater of Doom."" Why read 152 when you can read 15 in ""The Bible According to Einstein."""
1,BORING!!,"This book is really boring, it took me 10 minutes to read one page. And everything went right over my head. The only reason why I read it is because I had to read it. I am an 8th grader and it is for my integrated physics and chemistry class. Innocent 8th graders shouldn't have to read this stuff."
5,This subject isn't written in stone - yet,"I started reading Vincent Courtillot's Evolutionary Catastrophes (volcanism) first in order to gain a handle on the mass extinction argument and found that this book challenges Walter Alvarez's book T. Rex And The Crater of Doom (comet or asteroid bombardment). Therefore, I started reading that at the same time; which got me to pull out and start skimming David Levy's Impact Jupiter (comet expert). In the meantime, I thought it prudent to start reading The Behavior of the Earth by Claude Allegre (plate tectonics), and picked up Steven Stanley's book Extinction (global climate change). Recently I saw via a Google search that Linda Elkins-Tanton now thinks that perhaps meteorite bombardment could have allowed hot magma to vent thus causing global climate change and hence the mass extinctions. This is fun!"
4,Good for kids,"Although adults may prefer another book on the topic, such as the excellent Night Comes To The Cretaceous, this book's only real failing is in dealing with the nasty tactics used by the late Luis Alvarez (the author's father and collaborator in the formation of the theory, and a brilliant physicist). The reading level is a bit less challenging than it could be for adults, but this is a book that would be great to share with your kids, or anyone's. Teachers could read this to their class in installments (except that probably isn't done any longer)."
5,Excellent book to boost inquiries in just about every field,"I got the hardcover edition in the library bookstore in Perth, Australia. Finally I had the chance to read all bout the K-T line that had the evidence of a cosmic impact that extinguished the dinosaurs.This is a a true scientific research, where many disciplines came into play in a span of over 2o years to finally produce enough evidence to pinpoint the culprit of the mass extinction 70 million years ago. For me it has been a source to see geology in a new way, to explore other fields and to have amore holistic view of the process where we all live in: the evolution of the earth.This is a book for the non-specialist but it is not dumbed down. Enjoy"
4,"As the child learns, the parent learns.","As the parent of a dinosaur-crazy boy, I have read nearly every juvenile dinosaur book at the library and bookstore. In preparation of future ""why"" questions I read this book. I was fascinated with the story of discovery. I feel much more prepared to answer questions and continue our dinosaur discovery."
5,Out of This World with Buffalo Bop,"How do they do it? Once more the German label, Buffalo Bop, bravely goes where no one has gone before. The result, 34 tasty outer space related obscurities from the 50s. You always get your money's worth from the Buffalo, 74 minutes and 48 seconds of rockin' weirdness. As usual, the genre leans heavily toward rockabilly. Aside from the Love Brothers version of ""Flying Saucers Rock 'N Roll"" all tracks will be unfamiliar to most listeners, but don't let that scare you away. There are some real treasures here! The titles themselves are historical flashbacks.....""Cape Canaveral"", ""Rocket to the Moon"", ""Shake It Over Sputnik"", ""Orbit Twist"", ""Honeymoon Trip to Mars"", and more. I continue to be amazed by the quality output of the rock and roll archaeologists at Buffalo Bop!"
3,Not completely terrible.,"It's golf, enough said. Oh wait, no...you have to position the player around the ball in order to change the direction of the shot. I played for a while and could never get the hang of it. It doesn't make sense that you should position the player in the way you do to get the ball to shoot in the direction you want. If you love the novelty of Atari then get this game...if you're looking for a good pre-NES golf game then get Miniature Golf for the 2600."
2,Transfer & Disc Problem,"This KINO release has some serious problems. First, there is an authoring error in which the menu screen breaks up and pixellates when you return to it from the feature or documentary. Second, the feature A COTTAGE ON DARTMOOR(1929) displays the ""herky-jerky"" movement seen with PAL to NTSC transfer errors (as in Milestone's PHANTOM OF THE OPERA-1925 DVD travesty). The documentary, SILENT BRITAIN, looks fine and does not exhibit the transfer error.I contacted Kino, but have received no response. Beware this release....maybe they'll fix it in the interim. Milestone never offered to fix their PHANTOM OF THE OPERA set.....so beware.Too bad, because the film is great. The documentary is a treasure. This is the first time that Kino has screwed up a release (as far as I know)."
2,"INCOMPLETE, TO SAY THE LEAST","The author somehow misses the intense war going between the C.I.A. and the State Dept. over Vietnam policy, just prior to the assassination of JFK.In a matter of minutes any interested party can access via the internet a slew of reporting detailing this power struggle, with some predicting dire consequences.Mr. Jones, although utilizing some of these same sources as he sees fit, ignores this evidence for some strange reason and methinks it to be by design.When mainstream historians want to ""get real"" with history, seek out the truth, the whole truth and nuthin' but the truth and let nature take it course, they will not only be doing themselves a favor (with regards to their long-term integrity) but will also be doing their country a Big Favor, too."
5,this is great,this is really great for when your in and out of the water it really keeps you warm....
1,soprano sax,"I found this to be the most disgusting example of clarinet playing that I've ever experienced. The tone production is atrocious, I almost believed that he was performing not on the clarinet but on the soprano sax, and it is clear that there was little if any preparation on Mr. De Peyer's part for this cd as he frequently flubs up any passage with note values exceeding the eighth note. I could not listen to it for more than 30 seconds before I had to turn it off due to the extreme aural and artistic violation it inflicts upon the listener."
4,Solid Chupacabra Movie,Can't go wrong with a film that's title already pays tribute to one of the greatest werewolf films of all time. Mexican Werewolf in Texas brought the monster horror film back to the desert. Not since the original Tremors has a film done this much to bring a local urban legend to the silver screen. Fun solid B-Movie for a good night in. Thank you Maverick for another gem of a film.
2,"Not a great movie, but I've seen worse","Okay, it wasn't that good as far as werewolf movies go, but to me the worse part of it was the actors and their accents. I don't mean to disrespect anyone with an accent, but these people sounded like they had Irish accents that were really tough to follow. I couldn't understand more than half of what they were saying. I actually believe it would have done better with subtitles."
1,Waste of time,"I am a horror movies fan, and the ONLY reason I got this piece of trash's DVD is that it's cover had a ""Winner of the blah blah award in the blah blah film festival"", and usually, movies that win a prize are good to watch, well I hate to say, I wasted my time & my money.Do NOT WATCH IT, even if you dont have anything else to do, go to sleep or do anything else."
1,Worst werewolf movie I've ever seen,"I thought this one would hold suite to 'An American Werewolf In London"", becuz of it's title of course, but it was NO where near AAWIL, or any werewolf movie for that matter. I don't even think it was really a werewolf-It came out in the daylight. Horror-ble!!!"
3,"was good, but it broke just a short time after i got it.","I received this camera for christmas, and It was very good for me at first. I like the 5x optical zoom. the display inside broke, however, after just a couple months."
2,The IRA a feminist movement? Who knew?,"This is an interesting read, but the basic premise (Ireland taken over by the Church with a capital C, women oppressed, the IRA to the rescue), doesn't ring true, and the rest suffers badly. A more socially aware future history of Ireland would be fabulous--I wish this had a little more flair to it."
4,Not Bad,"As many other people feel, this CD is missing a lot of their true greatest hits. It is a good example of how Anthrax has changed their style over the years, but has still kept it real. All I can say is this is a greatest hits CD...nothing new on it. So if you like Anthrax or want to get into them you probably should get it."
5,THIS ALBUM NEEDS FIVE STARS,"Okay, I dont actually have this album, but I have just about every Anthrax studio album there is, and I have heard most of the remix albums too. Lets put it like this- Im a hardcore Anthrax fan. If you dont have any Anthrax CDS, get this one. Because it features just what it says, their greatest hits. See, Anthrax is a pretty hard band to get in to. They are the kind of band that you have to listen to their songs a couple of times before you get the knack of it. This album is good because it features most of their catchiest tunes and some personal favorites of mine, but to buy an Anthrax Album if you have never heard them is a risk. Espeacially if you are only used to thrash metal bands more like Metallica and Slayer or new metal bands like Korn and Staind, if that is what you are used to, chances are you wont like Anthrax. But give them a try, but this CD."
3,good cd,"this is a great cd but there's a few things wrong with it. ""Caught In A Mosh"" isn't on there (BIG mistake), the album can get boring in spots, and they have a RADIO EDIT of ""I'm The Man"" (which is a MASSIVE mistake). i think the ""I'm The Man"" radio edit just ruins any enjoyment from the rest of the cd. although ""Indians"" is on there and that's a cool song."
2,"Nothing new or hot enough to make this a ""Must Have""","Yawn. I like Anthrax a lot. I've still got Fistful, Armed and Dangerous, Spreading and ATL on Vinyl. I've even got the Armored Saint Demo on vinyl. I like John Bush with or without Anthrax and have always thought he was a much stronger metal singer than Joey.ButThis album is pointless. It doesn't matter if it's the best of Anthrax or not it's the same stuff we already have. If these were live or dramatically different it'd be worth it, but most are the same studio tracks you got on the albums.And why are the liner notes censored?The most recent CDs have been strong enough to warrant a much better compilation effort.Wait for something new, we've all been here.NYHC"
4,A good overview of a great band,"One of the big four (Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax) to bring the thrash scene to the forefront, of those four it seems that Anthrax never got all the attention that they deserved. This greatest hits collection compiles all their supposed great material from the Joey Belladonna and John Bush eras; Belladonna and Bush even sing together on a cover of the Temptation's ""Ball of Confusion"", and that track is a nice little extra to this package. However, there a number of songs that should have been included on here that weren't. Songs like ""Black Lodge"", ""Nothing"", ""Belly of the Beast"", ""Riding Shotgun"", and ""Caught in a Mosh"" aren't on here, and they should be. I mean I'd rather see those songs on here than ""Room For One More"" and ""Potter's Field"" which I didn't think were so great. However, if you are a newcomer to Anthrax, this is as good a place to start as any."
4,These guys should have been bigger,"Anthrax was at the forefront of the speed/thrash metal movement, but while bands like Metallica and Megadeth achieved superstar status, Anthrax for some unknown reason dropped back. This collection will have those not familiar with the band wondering why that happened. Anthrax doesn't seem to take themselves too seriously (except when it comes to censorship issues), and, unlike others of the genre, have been blessed with frontmen who can actually sing! They are definitely a high-energy band as well, with just enough melody in their songs to keep things interesting for those of us who are not habitual moshers. ""Attack Of The Killer A's"" is a good overview of Anthrax's career, although I was disappointed that the sublime ""Medusa"" wasn't included. Crank it up and get dirty looks from your neighbors!"
5,A Must Have for Anthrax fans and fans of classic metal bands.,"The title speaks for itself: Return of the Killer A's: The Best of Anthrax. These are the songs that made Anthrax one of the best classic metal bands of all time. They are one of the First Four original metal bands that set the standard for the rest of em, including Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth.This album has what you need to get into Antrax if you are new to them, and/or new to metal. It is essential if you are not new. 'nuff said.The last song on the list: I am the Law, is one of the greatest songs of all time, regardless of genre.You could buy another cd, or a different Anthrax cd, but then you wouldn't have this one."
2,"EDITED VERSION OF ""I'M THE MAN""",WHAT THE HECK!! THEY INCLUDED THE RADIO EDIT OF I'M THE MAN!? What kind of greatest hits includes radio edits.
3,Okay compilation,"Anthrax is a great thrash metal band. They have MANY good songs, a lot more than the sixteen tracks here. While it is lacking, it has some good, redeeming factors. How does this stack up? Read on to find out.PROS:-You get many of Anthrax's best works on one CD.-It's a cheap compilation.-Almost fills the limit you can fit on a CD.-Has new songs. (i'll review them before I finish this review)CONS:-WHERE THE F**K IS CAUGHT IN A MOSH?!?!?!?!?!??!?!-Doesn't have songs from all of Anthrax's album.-Has the RADIO EDIT of I'm The Man.THE NEW SONGS:3. Potter's Field (Remix)-5/5-A great song gets a great remix.4. Ball of Confusion-5/5-HOLY CRAP!!! Joey Belladonna, John Bush AND Danny Lilker on the same track!?!?!?!?! 'Nuff said.8. Hy Pro Glo (Remix)-5/5-See track 3.Overall:If you're new to Anthrax, DON'T buy any of their compilations, buy Among The Living.'Nuff said."
5,Excellent Cytology Book,"For those who want to take advantage of all the means of getting information, in this case, cytology, this is a very good book. It has severall ilustrating images and describes perfectly on text, what you should see. This is a book I recomend every clinician to have."
5,Unique Perspective,"Yeah, yeah, everyone's perspective is unique. Trite concept.Except this book has something very valuable. It contains the perspective of a clinical psychologist who elected to obtain fairly extensive cosmetic surgery (for its own sake, not in order to write this book!) and observed herself go through all the emotional turmoil that this produces, which was much greater than she anticipated. She researched the existing literature on the subject, interviewed many patients herself, and then wrote a guide for laypeople to the psychology of the process of obtaining cosmetic surgery--making the decision and dealing with the outcome, good or bad.Don't look to this book for technical information about procedures. That can change from month to month, from doctor to doctor. Together with _Survival of the Prettiest_, this is essential reading for those considering or scheduling cosmetic surgery."
4,Love the pictures and enjoyed learning a bit about the history,fun to review. Handed it over to my Dad (who is now 73) and it brought back great memories for him.
2,Flat Static Characters from Central Casting,"After having read several of the reviews for this book, I decided to give it a try. Never before have I read a book with such cookie cutter characters. They are simple and unchanging, with no depths, thoughts, or emotions (the one exception is the knight's mother, she displays her everlasting sadness, but even then, that is her only emotion.) The young knight, the loyal squire, the recluse sorcerers, the nonspecific seer, etc. You needn't waste your time reading this book. Halfway through, you'll throw it down and say ""Who cares?"""
3,Deceptive Photo,"I had a terra cotta garlic keeper that got broken. This one looked just like it, so I was happy to order it. When it arrived, however, it was MUCH SMALLER than I expected, and I can only keep two heads of garlic in it at a time. I could keep four or five heads in my old one. It will do its job just fine, but it is smaller than the picture suggests."
5,Never thought I would ever use a Garlic Keeper BUT...,"With a change of life style diet comes many surprises, including using fresh rather than powdered or ground garlic. But how to store it, keep it fresh, and ready for immediate use??? I did a bit of research and found the BEST way to store garlic was in a 'pot' - a Terracotta pot. (To the uninitiated, that is a simple clay pot which has not been glazed or sealed.)I looked at a dozen different storage pots - then found this little gem. It is 100% teracotta; attractive; small enough to set on a shelf over the sink; and, big enough to hold TWO BULBS of garlic. Its best feature is IT WORKS, and very well. I have used one bulb, and added another - both are still store fresh.This item has my highest recommendation."
3,Much smaller than it seems.,"Was fairly disappointed when I received this and found out that it can only hold 1-3 cloves of garlic. For someone who goes through a ridiculous amount of garlic, this doesn't cut it. For normal people, it may suffice."
2,Not what I needed,"This foam fell short, or should I say fell narrow, of a twin bed. I bought it to add to a little hide-a-bed loveseat and was unhappy with the width. Maybe I should have paid more attention to the photo because it shows it about two inches narrower than the mattress under it - that's two inches on each side."
4,The Elephant Motor's inside story.,"Get ready to take notes, and it wouldn't hurt to have a slide rule handy either! Although, this book has many terrific photos of Hemi cars, engines, racers etc., it is much, much more than a Muscle Car photo book. This book is the definative history of the Hemi engine. With a well laid out format, and wonderful rare photos and diagrams, the reader will learn all there is to know about the technical history of the mighty motor . This book is a must for the Mopar fanatic! Why, it makes you want to run right out and buy one of these rare and awesome automobiles! Oh, but plan on selling your house to afford one. ---- TERRIFIC BOOK!"
4,Decent ska offerings....,"Mu330 provides the middle ground between Reel Big Fish ska and Less Than Jake craziness (ska/punk)...if you like either of these bands (as you should, they both rule) you'll like Mu330. As opposed to the Hippos, they have their own ska flavor (the hippos are blatant RBF rip offs) and a really cool sound. Similar to Mustard Plug (only with a much cooler singer) this is a CD definitely worth adding to your collection. Oh, and these aren't sell outs or posers incase you're unfamiliar with the band and looking for a quality ska alternative to Less Than Jake, RBF, or the Bosstones."
3,"I hate to bring this band's 5-star avg. down, but...","MU330 has made a dissappointment here. ""Press"" was much better, but this one's more ska than the last one. It's entertaining, but not really a great CD."
2,Boring. Stay away from this book.,"I read and collected all Jill Marie Landis books since I read her first book WildFlower. Most of her books were full of humour and romance. Sad to say she has lost her touch this time. Celine is boring and Cord has a very shallow character. I cannot wait till the end and skipped so many pages just to finish the book. If I had borrowed it, it would be returned right after the 5th chapter. The first few chapters were interesting until Celine and Cord left for St. Stephen island. Thereafter, it's not worth the time I spent. It's certainly not worth the money I spent."
5,Live After Dark,I am a blues freak and this disk is some of the best female blues I have ever heard.
3,virtuoso writing and acting all round,"A favorite show of all time. I just watched the episode ""A Question Of Loyalty"". This shows Sir Humphrey at his most delightfully apoplectic and outraged. His facial expressions are always priceless, changing in a flash to perfectly express his shifting reactions and inner states. But here he outdoes himself as he tries to maintain his monumental verbal poise, and suppress his vehement indignation when the tables are turned on him to challenge his confident assumption of power over his minister. MInister Hacker is a riot as his face shows how his anxiety over how he is perceived starts to overwhelm him in the face of a threatening criticism by an obnoxious questioner in a committee hearing, and challenging interrogation at number 10---until he can somehow find the strength to fight back. True comedy acting and writing virtuosity all round."
3,"Good, but could have used more meat.","I enjoyed this book because it's one of my favorite topics. The book has some interesting things to say, although it's more along the lines of a magazine's style than I had anticapted. Some of the more recent findings aren't in here, such as shoulder-to-waist ratio for men. Sex appeal is also aimed slightly more toward women than men. I would have preferred more research, and less filler, but I read it cover to cover."
1,Poorly Made Comb,"I used this comb 5 times to apply conditioner to my hair and one tooth in the middle of the comb broke off. Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the quality of this product. I would have expected Mason Pearson to have a better product. I use the Mason Pearson Detangler Comb and Popular Brush and love both products. However, the comb is definitely not worth the price. Save your money and do not buy this product!"
1,very disappointed,The comb broke the first time I tried it. One spoke of the comb snapped off and my hair was not very knotted. I love the brushes but I do not recommend this comb.highly displeased.
1,WTF!!,"Not only did it not come with any adapter tips for any cell phone but no where does it tell you how to get an adapter tip for your cell phone!!! All it is is a silver tube and a battery, THATS IT!!! Dont go through the hassle, just buy a different brand that comes with tips for your phone. :("
1,Misleading picture...,"Product's picture was misleading. I thought I was buying a cuban/curb link bracelet. It got delivered promptly in a nice velvet box. But they sent me a cuban squared link bracelet. It looked awful and tacky for my taste. I contacted seller several times trying to simply exchange it for another merchandise. I was told to go online and order replacement piece. It's been showing as not available for 3 weeks. Finally I decided to return product for a refund on 5/02. Todays is 5/14, I already paid my credit card and I haven't seen my money back. Seller never called me to solve issue. By the way, because the bracelet cost 5 cents less than the minimum requirement to get ""free shipping"" status, I had to pay for shipping. After I got the product delivered, I went online and the very same product was eligible for free shipping. I also had to pay shipping for returning the product. Netaya fooled once. There won't be a second time!!"
4,good read,"The book starts out rather slowly, increases in interest as it goes along.It really hits it's stride about a third of the way through. It does capture your imagination and seemingly is autobiographical,the child of Holocaust survivors. Is it worth your time? Definitely, once you get into the story of a seemingly heartless mother, controlling a son to be more than he should be."
5,suspenseful and meaningful read,"This is an extremely well-written novel about the child of Holocaust survivors. It is extremely suspenseful, and although parts of it are painful to read, it is difficult to put down. One of the main issues the book addresses is coping in a world that can be evil. It is also a book about families, reconciliation, and understanding."
3,no night light display,Great thermometer but no night light display which is critical for me since my child sleeps in the dark most of the time when he's sick.
4,Love the smell,"First thing which I would mention about this product is that, as the name suggests ""JOVAN WHITE MUSK by Jovan COLOGNE SPRAY 3.25 OZ for WOMEN"",it is actually from Coty and not Jovan, thats the reason I gave it 4 stars, though I don't regret buying it as the smell is just awesome, I am a big Jovan Fan and love the floral fragrances from them which are so feminine and sophisticated and light."
1,Horrid Buying Process,"Placed a $3,000 order for Toshiba M700 Tablet, and Toshiba would not process the order for ""my own protection."" They might call you in a week to tell you that to protect you, they would not ship the laptop, and that you should call them back to verify. So, if you need to buy something hassle-free, find another vendor -- Toshiba is just going to work against you, and when you finally get to speak with them, it will be that they would be ""doing you a favor"" that they actually process your order, for which you paid. Again, for your own good... expect a huge delay and get ready to spend a good time on the phone ""walking"" your order through.Also, I agree with the previous review -- get a UPS account to ship your laptop back and forth to fix it. Toshiba appears arrogant and not a happy organization."
2,Good while it lasted,"It's a remarkably bright, handy little flashlight. Perfect for my key chain. Too bad it stopped working after a few months. I took it apart and as far as I can tell there is a disconnect somewhere in the head assembly. I can't figure out exactly where. It bugs me because the switch still works and the LED still works and the case is solid. A lot of these small flashlights have a flaw like this - they work well for some months and then the cheapest part goes bad and you have a machined aluminum sculpture for your junk drawer.I also have a Fenix LD10 which is holding up nicely. It's brighter than a full sized Maglight."
1,Awful unless you don't mind elephant ankles,I was very excited to get no run pantyhose but these are the worst. The first time I wore a pair of the pantyhose I noticed they didn't feel snug - totally the opposite of control top. I wasn't looking for control top but I still appreciate a pair of pantyhose that cling. I washed the pair and wore them a second time around and noticed they were baggy on my knees and ankles. They are like a throwback to pantyhose from 25 years ago before spandex. Totally embarrassing and uncomfortable since so baggy. I am throwing out the rest of my 6 pack.
2,Not as good as the original...,"...our son loves ""Put Me in the Zoo"" so we were excited to get the other Spot books. Unfortunately, the sequel does not live up to first book."
4,"Forget Scooby Doo, it's the Powerpuff Girls you want!","The tape features a Powerpuff Girls bonus toon called ""Boogie Frights"" where the Powerpuff Girls save Townsville from the evil Boogie Man who tries to make the night last forever. If you love Star Wars, Roller Disco or anything 70's, you will love this spoof! @u@"
4,Scooby-Doo Greatest Mysteries,"This is a good video.It contains four of Scooby Doo's Most Popular Mysteries.1. A Clue For Scooby Doo2. Hassle in the Castle3.Jeepers, It's the Creeper4.The Backstage RageAnd contains a Scooby-Doo Extra Footage and A Powerpuff Girls Cartoon !109 Minutes Of Scooby-Doo Where Are You? Get This Video. If You Do Rank Rou ! Ruy Rhis Rideo !"
1,Same Episodes Again!,"As most people have stated, this DVD has 2 or 3 episodes that are already available on other Scooby compilations. We fans have to figure out how to petition Warner if we want to see other episodes released!"
4,get over hassle in the castle,I think hassle in the castle is on too much dvds. In fact it is one of the worst episodes. Here are all the episodes:1. a clue for scooby doo (B-)2. hassle in the castle (c+)3. jeepers its the creeper (A+)4. backstage rage (A)the end
1,Here We GO AGAIN!!! RELEASE DIFFERENT ONES,"Well Warner is releasing duplicate episodes again. why don't they put all the scooby-doos out. They have 5 DVDs of cartoons out and Hassle in the Castle is on 3 of them. 3 out of the 4 episodes on this DVD are already on DVD. I don't think anyone should pay 15 dollars for only episode that isn't released yet!!!I am getting the other ones that are coming out though. So in short I don't reccommend this to anyone. Not only that, they are wasting a whole DVD for only 4 eps. 3 of which are already out. They should release different ones like Terror in the Big Top, Dr.Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde and other ones from the series. They should release Scooby Movies with Speed Buggy and Josie and the Pussycats. In short I'll just say I am sick of duplicate Scooby episodes."
1,BEWARE this is just a re-release of titles on other DVDs.,"These mysteries are so great, they have already been released on DVD! Warners must hope you will keep buying the same titles for your kids as long as they are re-packaged. Sooner or later they will know they are getting the same stories. As for us adult fans who grew up on these, we already know. There are at least 13 original mysteries still not released on DVD, but Warners just wants to keep giving us the same 13 already released.I'm glad I looked up the titles before buying this rehash DVD."
4,Just Right (Didn't Want the Whole Series Box Set),"I wanted a few episodes to pop into the dvd player once in a while (nostalgic trip down Saturday morning lane), and I didn't feel the need to buy an entire season box set of this show. A little goes a long way.This is perfect because it features just a few shows for a quick Scooby fix."
1,Not a good buy!,"I purchased these in a size 5 for my daughter because a) they were less than some of the other stride rite shoes and b) they were adorable. Well, these were just unwearable and I even had them fitted and checked in the stride rite store. The velcro was always coming undone, the shoes always falling off plus they were very stiff so she had difficulty walking in them. In the end, we always had to take the shoes off for her to run around in until I finally conceded and bought a pair of the $42 katy (I belive) shoes which are what you would expect from a stride rite shoe."
5,Call of Duty 2,Great graphics and game play. Activision contuines to improve the games they create. Very happy with this game.
3,Tiresome Deja Vu WWII Shooter,"If you played COD1 and the UO expansion pack, there is nothing here that is worth playing yet AGAIN, unless you are 100% engrossed in the WWII FPS genre. The overall feel of the game, while slightly different due to the modified health system, is very much the same as before. The weapons are exactly like they were before, and you can't help saying to yourself ""didn't I do this already???"". Cannot recommend unless you are a serious WWII fan."
4,THE best FPS in gaming history... Period... NO argument,"Definately an AWESOME game. But let me tell all of you something. DONT buy this product for the campaign mode (or adventure mode, etc...) buy it for the online multiplayer!!! YOU can play locally in your city, or ANYWHERE around the world!!! An also addition to this game is that there are over 200 severs for online!!! and the best part... the ONLINE multiplayer is... FREEEEE!!!! NO FEES... EVER!!! thats right... FREE... FOREVER!! I got this for my B-day, and it was the best thing i got! I couldnt believe, no payments. I couldnt even believe that there was no hook-up cords to the computer you needed! Just click multiplayer when you download the game,and you go into ONLINE multiplayer action!! I suggest it to anybody... you heard me... ANYBODY. I hope this was a helpful review!!!- Liam Klaxon, VA"
2,Not worth it,"Call of Duty 2 is essentially identical to the first game. There are a few new weapons which I believe are most accurately and fairly described as ""sorta neat"", and obviously, the graphics have received a huge boost as well. That's really about it, however. It's a solid game, but in no way a must-own title.Unless you absolutely have to buy Call of Duty 2 because you're in a clan, you're better off just sticking to the original. You'll get exactly the same gameplay for a lot less money. And hey, it'll run a hell of a lot better too. In fact, I even found that the updated visuals (particularly the bloom lighting and smoke effects) were often rather hard on the eyes and distracting to gameplay.Honestly, pass this one up. As stated in the review title, it's just not worth it."
3,not as good as everyone says,if you own fear or quake 4 you know what im talking about... this game was not as good as all the hype.... go get quake 4 or fear... bot were far better than cod2.... i stopped [playing this game after 4 missions... too repetitive... find cover shoot.... find cover.... never ending enemies....boo.... 3 out of 5... go buy quake hl2 or fear.... BF2 is great as well... COD2 is just another ww2 shooter.... pass it buy...
1,"They sent the 51S, not the item pictured - DO NOT BUY","As the subject said. I was hoping to get the product pictured as it is superior in every way to the inferior replacement 51S. The description also says ""Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock"" which is also incorrect. Everything about this listing is wrong, and you should not buy this.For what it's worth, you can probably get it cheaper from someone else if you want the 51S, by the way.I always ignore reviews when people shout ""DO NOT BUY"", but I'm now writing one. BUYER BEWARE. DO NOT BUY. I can't believe Amazon lets this go on."
1,Foiled Again,I was very disappointed that the foil part of the shaver got a hole in it less than two weeks after he replaced it. The last foil he put on lasted around a year.
4,Excelent OEM Replacement,"I had to replace the original foil and cutterblock on the Braun shaver I purchased 2 years ago. The shaver is now back up to performing as it did when it was new. So far, nothing but praise for the Braun products I have purchased."
4,It renewed my Activator 8595,"After using my original Foil and Cutterblock since February 2005 until the foil worn to the point of a gap appearing, I finally ordered the replacement Combi-Pack. I have to admit that I was being too cheap and now my razor feels like new again."
1,Not as advertised,Was not the item pictured on this page. Fits but does not shave as well as the correct model. Avoid!
1,Destroys value of razor through awful fit,"This is the worst replacement I've ever purchased for a product I own. I have been a happy 8585 owner for years, with the razor and its replaceable parts provider the best shave I've ever had. This new horrible replacement block has torn up my face and made shaving a nightmare. I'm trying the 7000 replacement as advised here. Braun made a terrible mistake. I don't know how I could trust them again."
2,Bad Product - Good Customer Service,"My foil lasted approximatly 6 weeks before developing a hole. Thereafter, I cut my face whenever I tried to use the razor. After a few attempts, I understood the price of a new foil was less than the expected doctor's bills if I kept slicing my face. I called Braun Customer Service and reported the problem. They were friendly and offered to send a new cutter block. Within 1 week they had done as promised and even followed up with a letter. Great service, but I hope the new one lasts a bit longer as I very much like the razor. By the way, if you have this problem the number for Customer Service is: (800)272-8611"
4,Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack Foil and Cutterblock Replacement Parts for Braun's Activator Razor Models 8595 and 8585,It was ok while I had the shaver. Started going through the foils too fast.
1,Wears out to fast,This is an expensive foil and should last more than three months. With out notice you feel cuts and see that the foil has a small hole and jagged edge that cuts.
1,Braun 8000 Activator Combi-Pack,"I don't have good things to say about this item I purchased as what I ordered and what I was given by the seller are two different things. When I challenged the seller on this matter, they told me that the item is no longer manufactured. Yet, they adverised it on Amazon! If they don't have the item to sell, then you shouldn't be listing it on Amazon..."
2,The mesh broke after three months,"I purchased a replacement for my Braun three months ago after the original mesh broke and started cutting my face. Guess what, the replacement head is now broken as well. I guess I will buy the third one and start treating this as a more fragile item, but this is definitely not what I expected when paying for a high-end shaver."
1,Bad Product,I would give this foil/cutter zero stars if possible. I took another reviewers advice and bought the Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro/Syncro Replacement Combo and it delivered a very nice shave. This replacement pulled whiskers and was a very bad shave. Braun should be ashamed of themselves for selling such junk.
1,Hard to review,"I can't review the 8100 foil & cutter since, although that is what I ordered, I received the inferior 51S replacementAnd at full price, not the one advertised for the 51S. Not much point in returning it if I have to pay more toShip it back & possibly getting a restock charge. I dislike false advertising and bait & switch. And the email shownOn the packing list was totally bogus, too."
3,braun 8000 foil and cutterblock,This foil and cutterblock is nowhere near as good as it used to be. Apparently Braun is farming it out to a cheaper manufacturer and it shows....badly.
3,These need to be replaced fairly often,18 months per set is impossible. These need to be replaced every 6-8 months to maintain the quality of shave. My screen wore through in 8 months.This is probably the most expensive shaving system on the market.
5,"braun model 8595 razor and replacement parts,This is the best razor","This the best razor i have ever used, i received it as a gift from my daughter purchased from amazon about a year ago. I would recommend this razor to any man who want a close shave. Andthe replacement paart about once makes it like a new razor.Thanks amazon for good service on getting parts R.E.Wilcox"
4,expensive disposables,the shaver is a great shaver but the blades dull very fast. the replacement parts make it work like new.
1,Razor cutterblock,This product was as dull as my 1 year old cutter block! Vendor was fantastic but I think he needs to review his supplier (from China).
4,Braun 8000 Combo Pack,"This is not a bad product. The only concern I have with it is the cost. I wish it had been in the ten dollar range. I have no idea how long this new foil and cutter block will last. My original foil and cutter block lasted for over four years with an average use of three times a week. Too, Amazon has comparable online prices and ease of shipping and internet securty. To me, company reputation is extremely important."
1,foil and cutter. for 8595 model A poor substitute for the original one,"My order was placed with AmazonI received myModel 8595 foil and cutter block yesterday. The original ones that came with the razor had an imprint of Activator. Not so, this one !!!If you have a tender skin, then best switch to another brand of razor. My intentions are just that. Two shaves and my face feels burned and the shaves were not close at all.Up to now, I have enjoyed this razor.Six years of great shaves. It has been pricey but worth it. All finished for me now."
5,Braun Activator replacement parts,One of the best products I have ever purchased. Have been using Braun electric razors for several years. Prices are very competative on Amazon.com. Less that what I would have paid locally if I could have found the Foil and Cutterblock for the Activator.
5,Reliable,"The item was received in new condition, as advertised, and well within stated timeframes. I recommend this seller."
1,Braun Activator Combi-Pack Foil & Cutterblock,I have ordered this item several times. All I recieve is that the item is being delayed for shipment. After several times of this I cancel the shipment. Had to do this several times.
4,Ease of replacement and makes your razor feel like it's new,I can't say enough about this cutter and foil. I've used 5 different electric shavers and this is the only one that cuts really close. Of course it is not the same as a straight razor but this Braun combination is the best on the market.
5,Braun 8000 Activator,The Combi-pack foil and cutter block are replacement parts for Braun's Activator Razor. The product is excellent.
5,Can't be better,"Great price and fast delivery. This is the second of these replacements I have purchased, and I'm back to being clean shaven again. It seems to be about an every 18 month or so ritual, but so pleasing once replaced."
1,Not product as seen in picture!,This is NOT the Braun 8000FC as indicated by the picture and on the invoice (if you buy). This is Braun's replacement #51S and it SUCKS! The cutter blade design has changed and it does not shave anywhere near as clean as the older design. I'd purchased these hoping to get the original design but was shipped the 51S. Just know and understand what you'll be receiving if you choose to buy!
1,Product quality has significantly declined! Buy Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo Instead,"For those of you (like me) who have noticed a significant decline in the Braun Activator replacement blades, I decided to take one for the team and try and see if the Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo would work in my Activator. The fit is perfect, and the blade style is of the thinner variety formerly used in the Activator. I had an immediate improvement in shave closeness--with none of the hair pulling of my old replacement blade. If you own an Activator and you're about to toss it out because of the terrible quality of these replacement blades, you might want to search for ""Braun 7000 Series Syncro Pro / Syncro Replacement Combo"" and try my route first. Hope this is helpful."
5,New blade = better shave,What else can I tell you? Remember how great a shave you got when you bought it? Get a new foil+cutterblock and you can get it back! The manufacturer says to replace them after 18 months but I found 12-14 months to be more accurate - and I don't shave weekends either!!!
1,New foil heads are defective,I believe Braun has changed the way they make the new replacement cutters and foil heads for the 8000 series razors. The older ones had grey plastic clips on the ends and the new ones have black. I have purchased three new sets in four months and all three have lost a clip off of the end. This causes the foils to vibrate. It is a very noticable change in the sound when turned on and the quality of shave is greatly reduced. I have used this razor for three years and never had this problem. I used the last replacement head two times before it broke.
5,Great cutterblock... but probably doesn't need to be replaced every 18 months,"I've had my Braun 8595 for over two years now. It's worked very well without anything falling apart on me. I previously had gone through two Remingtons in less than one year. Braun recommends replacing the cutterblock every 18 months but I let it slide to 24. I definitely have noticed a little improvement over shave time. Don't feel that you need to replace the cutterblock in exactly 18 months... if you're not having any shaving irritation or note any significant delay in shaving time, delay your purchase."
4,Works fine,I used these replacements for my Braun 8595 and they work fine. There a number of negative reviews posted here saying that these replacements are not as good as the previous ones but I can't tell the difference; they appear to be as good as they ever were.
3,does the job...,"I bought this because I lost the slip-on lens cap to my Hoya slim circular polarizer. It fits the polarizer just fine, but it is a little bulkier - but it works. Note - it is hard plastic. Whether good or bad, my original was flexible plastic - I kind of liked the old one better. But, this works fine."
4,BUEN COMIENZO.............ALBUM DEBUT 4 STARS,BUEN DEBUT MUCHAS CANCIONES PARA RELLENAR EL DISCO PERO ES BUENO DE VERDAD. UN DISCO QUE VALE LA PENA TENER.
3,"Admirable idea, takes too much for granted","I was excited when I heard the author prepared this book for experienced developers. However, it is apparent that this is just code for those experienced with developing Visual Basic applications, not taking into account the rest of us out here learning Visual Basic through ASP and VBA. As an ASP developer, I know how to register components, and write all the necessary code. But I'd like to know how to build a menu for an application. Apparently Mr Foxall thinks that means I shouldn't be reading his book. I would suggest Mr Foxall be less condescending when targeting his audience. Yes, there are experienced developers out here who want to get MCSD certified without having the prior experience of building menus, and who would like to rip up the copious amounts of this book devoted to COM basics."
5,A Bible for MCSD aspirants,"I recently took my MCP exams on 70-176 and 10-175. Passed with a score of 985/1000 and 957/1000 respectively. The book has played a very great role in fetching me the score.The book is excellent and covers all the topics that are needed for the exams. Also, book is an excellent reference for any advanced VB programmer.No doubt its a bible that should be present in any VB programmer's book shelf!"
4,Good for preparing for Desktop exam,"I used this book for preparing for the desktop exam. Make no mistake about it, it does not teach you how to program in Visual Basic. But if you feel comfortable in the VB, I dont think there is a better resource out there to help you get ready for the exam."
4,I passed 70-176 with the help of this book,"This is a very valuable book. It defintely helped me not just prepare, but learn those aspects of VB that you don't use every day, like ActiveX Docs, and the P&D wizard. However, I couldn't bring myself to give it the full 5 stars for this reason. Even though the book was an excellent source of info for the test, I still had to buy another book - even though I have been using VB for several years. I still had to brush up on the basics, which Mr. Foxall does not cover. As a VB programmer, I don't keep everything in my head all the time. MSDN is always readily available to me, so I do not have to memorize certain things that are covered on the test. Regardless, the book did help, and for that I give it 4 stars."
5,Most bang for the buck!,"MCSD in a Nutshell is by far the best book you can get for Visual Basic certification exams. It takes a no-nonsense approach to the topic. The most basic areas are not covered, but it covers a lot of ground. If you are well versed with visual basic, then this book will give you the boost you need to brush up on your skills, prepare you for the obscure topics of the exams, and make you aware of how to use VB in general. Not just for the exams, it's an excellent quick reference tool.It's not riddled with code, but it uses code in adequate amounts to explain the section in question. Its ""Key Facts"" section summarizes the chapters very well - something that one can scan through before the exams. There are also a proportioned amounts of questions at the end of the chapters for self testing.Considering the low price as compared with other competing books, MCSD is a sureshot winner."
5,My son's favorite book,This is my two-year-old son's favorite book. He has heard it a hundred times and is not tired of it.
4,cute,"My toddler isn't as into this train book as his is some of his others, but I don't know why. It introduces bunches of different kinds of trains. The pictures are bright and clear and the text is simple. I think it is a great toddler book."
5,Trains by Byron Barton,"Our two year old grandson loves trains, and since I want him to love books, this selection pleases both of us when he comes to visit. He asks for this book and tells me a story about the trains. The colorful and simple drawings leave room for imagination."
3,Didn't realize how small the book is,I obviously did not pay attention to the dimensions because the book is 5 inches. Next time I need to read the fine print.
3,Not as good as other Barton books,"This story was kind of boring, not as melodic as some of the other books (Cars is our favorite) but kind of cute. Graphics are somewhat boring too (compared to the others)"
3,"average, considering the potential","i have to wonder what swallow was thinking - i was hoping to hear him dig in like he does on his most recent album ""damaged in transit"". instead he seems to settle for simple turn-arounds and boring vamps. see www.bassheadmedia.com in june for my full blurb on this disc. scofield sounds great, but this disc doesn't reach it's potential"
4,More of a good story,"The middle DVD of the three in Banner of the Stars II continues the increasingly personalized story in this character-driven, intelligent science fiction. The results are satisfying and enjoyable, but leave the viewer anxious for the next disc and the conclusion of the story. It's been interesting to see how the anime has developed over the long arc since the beginning of Crest of the Stars. The drama has narrowed in scope and sweep but has increasingly focussed on characters. Faced with crisis on the prison planet, Lafiel, Jinto, and even Admiral Spoor, who gets some quality screen time, all wrestle with issues of Abh honor, duty, battles and personal feelings. DVD extras again include notes from the original novel's author. This series seems more enjoyable as it goes on; one can only hope that we'll someday see ""Battle of the Stars III"" or that the novels get translated into English."
5,bpotterUT,"It isn't often in my CD collection do I put aside something as OK, and then come back to it a few years later and realize I had missed something. In the case of Glitter in the Gutter, I found a haunting, poetic gem that was lost with a couple hundred other CDs. Jesse was fantastic on his earlier recordings as well, but hearing the Boss sing with Malin was phenominal. To be honest, I had forgotten about Jesse, but I am exilerated at what I have just rediscovered and will be listening for months to come."
5,This Guy Just Keeps Getting Better!,"After his first 2 superb albums Distruction and Heat, I never would have thought this was going to be better again. But it is! It starts out with great heavy guitar riffs and great lyrics like In The Modern World. The standout Broken Radio which is a duet with Springsteen. Another personal favourite is Aftermath but every song is great. Its an album that once you put it on you never want to take it off, and lets face it that doesn't happen too often this day and age. This could be the album of the year!"
3,Dissatisfied,"The product wasn't in a perfect state and, even if it arrived in a very short time, I'm not satisfied about the price/product relation"
3,"Easy to read, humorous, tends to drag","I read this book for a summer reading assignment for an English II Honors Course. Initially, I dreaded to start reading the 527 pages of ""nothingness"". However, I found that it was easy to understand (this was strange...a classic???) and I actually understood the humor. However, the chapters began to drag and I found myself becoming irritated with the insanity of Don Quixote. This is a good summer read to pass the hot lazy days with.*I suggest you have a really fun book to read as soon as you finish the 527th page of Don Quixote*"
1,Poor quality book,"This book was not in good condition! Half of the binding was missing and the pages were extremely yellowed and falling out. As my son read the book, the pages fell out and it is now in many pieces. This book was purchased for his high school summer reading and the condition of it made it extremely difficult to use to complete his project and the book will need to be thrown away."
1,Help me get through this.,"I am in the process of reading this book with my child for a school assignment. I haven't quite figured out why so many people like it. It is the most boring book I've ever read, and it is way too long. It is pure drudgery!! Help me, I'm going to go crazy myself reading about crazy Don Quixote."
1,useless for software,"I looked up the people I knew and knew of. None of them were in. Gradually, I realized this is a hardware history, and a US-based one at that. Hardware is important, but software is more important."
4,Insightful!,"Paul E. Ceruzzi, curator of the National Air and Space Museum, describes the development of computing, starting with its earliest history. He examines the beginnings of commercial computing from 1945 to 1956 and traces the history of computer hardware and software, dividing these developments into five- to 10-year time periods. His book emphasizes technical development, rather than personalities or business dynamics, a focus that contributes to its fairly dry, academic style. With this caveat, we [...] recommend the book primarily to those with a technological bent, such as professionals in operations and computer sciences, and academics in the field. However, if you are interested in the subject, you'll love this. Ceruzzi provides an informative and comprehensive saga including extensive footnotes and a bibliography that runs about 80 pages."
3,no mention of Shockley?!,"Ceruzzi defines the modern computing era as post World War 2. His narrative shows a twist perhaps unappreciated by current readers. Nowadays, all computers use semiconductor chips. Mostly made of silicon. But the use of such chips did not become widespread till the 1960s. For the first 20 years, computers used tubes. (Yuk.)He explains why tubes were eventually abandoned, as being too bulky and slow compared to silicon based integrated circuits. There are several crucial landmarks scattered throughout the text. Like the invention of the integrated circuit by Kilby and Noyce, and that of the microprocessor by Hoff and Faggin. Curiously, the invention of the transistor in 1947-8 goes unremarked. With no mention at all of one of its inventors, Shockley. A grievous oversight, since he started a group, with members like Noyce and Moore, that would later prove crucial in developing the industry."
2,Some very obvious omissions,"I can't believe a book titled ""A History of Modern Computing"" does not mention the impact home computers such as the Sinclair, the various Ataris, the VIC-20, the C64 and others had in making computing accessible for the masses, or the impact that cheap home computers had in shaping a whole generation of programmers and engineers. The book totally ignores the revolutionary Amiga, LOGO language, and videogames which have been instrumental in driving technical improvements and driving computer market penetration. In short, this ""history of modern computing"" ignores some of the most important aspects of the computer revolution of the 80's and 90's which could have been well covered in a chapter or two."
1,cheap useless scissors - do not bother,"Needing more scissors around the house, I picked up a pair of these at the drugstore. Well you get what you pay for - they are cheap and have a strangely stupid and uncomfortable grip. Do not bother. I'm really bummed that the Metro 3-piece Household Scissors set is unavailable since I see great reviews for it and it's just what I'm looking for. Hope it will come back in stock soon!"
3,Disappointment,"I have read all the ""Promise"" books and was quite anxious to read ""Return To Promise"". I was disappointed! It was only about Jane and Cal's marital problems. There are so many delightful characters living in Promise Tx - I would have loved to read about some of the other inhabitants! I hope Ms. MacOmber will 'return' to Promise with more books about the other folks!"
2,"Not My Favorite ""Promise"" Book","I've read all the Promise books and looked forward to this sequel, but I was disapointed in what has happened to the ""Dr. Jane"" character. She doesn't act very intelligently (IMO) for an educated and previously spirited lady, in fact, she seems rather like a 1950's type of woman. And Cal, unfortunately, acts like an demanding jerk. (I realize their conflict is the point of the story, but it didn't seem very realistic as the characters seemed more mature in the previous books.) Of course there was a happy outcome, although it felt rather contrived. I read the whole thing to see what happened to the characters of Promise, who I rather liked (enough to buy the books), but I wouldn't really recommend buying this one unless you are a big-time ""Promise"" fan and want to add it to your collection. I'm a fan of this author's books, but, sorry, not really of this - although it is still an OK read & somewhat updates the series."
3,Good update of Cal and Jane,"While this is suppossed to be an update of the people of Promise, I really only felt updated on Cal and Jane's life. All the other characters were barely mentioned in forms of, ""That must be Nell's pie...or Savannah brought me lunch...or Grady and his kids...I would have LOVED to have more info about what was going on in the other people's lives as well. I really thought that Cal was being a jerk and never really owned up to that fact. Go Jane!!She was great..."
1,I Don't Think So,"I'm sorry but I guess I am swimming against the tide of good reviews. I didn't finish this book. I thought the behavior of Cal and Jane just to juvenile to be real. His ""ah shucks do you think so?"" attitude was too much. And Jane's believing the worst about the encounters between Cal and Nicole was not understandable. What was she basing her conclusions she was jumping to on? I have read other Macomber books such as 16 Lighthouse Rd and thoroughly enjoyed them, but this one was apprentice work to say the least."
3,Plot too cliche,"The plot was just extremely cliche. Happily married husband and wife with 2 children. Wife and children go out-of-town. Sexy girl in town now interested in husband. Both are seen together and gossip around town starts. Wife and children get back and wife is the last to know about girl and husband being seen together. She automatically assumes he cheated on her without knowing the context. Miscommunication, assumptions, and jumping to conclusions ensue and causes their marriage to be in jeopardy. This is such a typical plot. I rolled my eyes many times at how cliche the book progressed."
4,Return to Promise,"Debbie Macomber's RETURN TO PROMISE delivers everything the cover copy promises. I certainly enjoyed visiting with old friends and making new ones. In particular, I found the description of the disintegrating marriage (Jane and Cal) believable and realistic. Their reconciliation was particularly moving. Jane's dealing with her father's death is also real and emotionally compelling. As always, Macomber's warmth and empathy with her characters comes through. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."
4,For old times' sake,"Back in the 70's I bought ""Trav'lin' Light"" on a Prestige 7"" vinyl single. I remember on this single ""Trav'lin' Light"" only lasted 3.32m.When I got older I started missing my old records, and when I found this album, I bought it, and to my surprise ""Tav'lin' Light"" (the song that introduced me to both Kenny Burrell AND Shirley Scott) is a little over a minute longer on this album.I am not really a jazz-man, that's why I only gave this album 4 stars, but I understand that this is a masterpiece for jazz-fans."
4,2 SESSIONS ON 1 CD,I would have said 2/LP's on 1 CD but We'll Be Together Again seems to be missing from the 1'st session with Kenny Burrell. The other session has Lem Winchester on vibes instead of a guitarist. I haven't heard it but it should be allright. A good Lem Winchester lead session is ANOTHER OPUS with Frank Wess on flute and pianist Hank Jones leading the rhythm section. It's certainly in Shirley's type of groove.
5,perfect,The box arrived intact and quickly. Crunchy Tasty and just what I needed for my low carb diet. I will be ordering more and would highly recommend this product.
3,Um...,"IT was, um, interesting... a story about two boys undergoing the trials of the African wild. I mean, what DO you say?"
2,Not Great,"Bought for my 8 year old daughter. She loved the first one, so I was really excited to get this one for her. First off, it isn't a woman speaking on the cd, it's a man. The first one was a woman. That threw my daughter off big time. She didn't like listening to the man. She also said it was boring and they talked about the dolphins too much (she even really likes the dolphins)I just don't think this cd was up to par compared to the first one."
5,Very Satisfied Customer,"I ordered the entire family collection of the ""stress free"" cds and books for our family a few weeks ago and they are absolutely wonderful. We have one son with psd-nos (non-verbal learning disorder. He has a lot of sensory integration issues. Our other son is very shy to show his emotions (frustration, anger, anxiety). The stree free products have given them both a starting point to learn and grown from and a place for us to start talking with them about emotions and how to cope with them in a healthy way. The approach taught in this program can be used throughout their life (and ours). It has been worth every single penny!"
1,Not what I expected,My daughter couldn't get through the first story. She was bored with it and wouldn't even give it another chance. I wasted my money.
2,"good concept, poor execution","I do not recommend this CD. I wish I could have listened to a sample of the CD before I purchased it. It was a waste of money. The electronic ""music"" or noise on this CD is annoying. I like the concept of teaching relaxation techniques to children. But my grandchildren did not like the narrator's voice or the music and asked that it be turned off. I was looking for something to help them fall asleep when they come to visit. This was not the right CD. A better choice for young children (infant to six) is Rainforest by Fisher Price. The music is soothing and can be played at very low volumn. Another favorite is the Garden of Serenity by David and Steve Gordon. While I think this CD is intended for adults, it is appropriate for any age. The grandchildren love the chime and water sounds. With either of these CD's they fall asleep within minutes."
4,A great find!,"I found the Lite books at the American Psychological Association conference this past August. While I work with adults I was browsing for something to help my 5 yr old get to sleep and to deal with pain management (frequent ear aches). I came away with Bubble Riding (lovely book) and subsequently got Indigo Ocean Dreams to check out more of what the Lite Selections have to offer. The Indigo Ocean Dreams CD has been a lovely addition to our bedtime routine. I feel good about the fact that my child is learning skills in such a sweet, enjoyable way and that will continue to be of use to him as he grows up (visualization, breathing, affirmations etc). A great find altogether - one that I'll be passing long to my child mental health colleagues!"
4,Great for kids!,I have been using this cd in classes at the school where I counsel. The kids are really enjoying learning how to relax and control their feelings. I think this is a great cd that can help kids learn to work with their breathing and practice meditation!
5,Recommend for all children,This is a great CD for all kids. The mans voice is so wonderful and the background music is beautiful. The stories are great because most kids love animals. I highly recommend it for those with more spirited children as well. Use the Angry Octopus when the feelings are strong and it really helps. We use it at night before bed. I have recommended to many others and you should get it.
4,Indigo Ocean Dreams,I bought this CD as a gift for a 10 year old for relaxation before bed. Although the recommended age was 6-12 I felt the stories were a little young for a 10 year old. It was appropriate for her 7 year old brother who enjoyed it very much. I would recommend it for younger children The CD was well done and helpful for calming down before bed. I would order from Indigo Dreams again and select something for older children.
5,Indigo Dreams audio,The CD is a great car item for my 6 1/2 yr. old son. This audio helps him to better learn how to express all of his emotions. He also understands how the story animals worked out their problems. We have one of the books as well and enjoy them both!
2,Repetitive - The same EXACT one as Indigo Dreams. But great if you don't have the first.,"I am kind of bummed because I went by one of these reviews that called this a ""sequel"" to the other one. It is NOT a sequel but is the exact same thing -- only the characters and setting have changed. Even my 8-year old noticed right away - ""Oh this is the caterpillar story"" and ""this is the boy and the bear."" We really liked the first CD, Indigo Dreams, and since this was described as for age 8-12, we thought it would be that ""next step.""Yet I feel we completely wasted money since we already had the first. But if you don't have the first, then this is a great item. I don't know too many 12 year olds who would listen to it, but it's great for kids 6-10ish who need to learn relaxation techniques. Right away my son incorporated some of the techniques and is beginning to make some process with his anxieties."
5,so cute!,"This CD is great! The stories are so cute and it teaches children at a young age how to deal with stess, anger and how to relax and feel better about themselves. I gave it to my niece who is easily frustrated and has quite a temper and she loves it. It really instills wonderful tools that kids need in order to deal with this crazy world and the pressures they face at school."
3,needs a few changes to be great,"I bought this for my eight year old. Nice stories, but the Cd is too long for a child to hear in one night and fall asleep at a decent time. My suggestion to the creator would be..Please alternate stories with music. The child could listen to one story and fall asleep to the music. The next night they could listen to another story and music, etc. My daughter told me "" I had to stay awake to hear the end!"" The stories are great!"
5,LOVELY & NECESSARY!,"As a psychologist and mother, I highly recommmend these CDs. They are creative, relaxing, and soothing to both parents and children. And when kids are relaxed so are parents. Kudos to Lori Lite!"
5,Grandma's opinion on Indigo Ocean Review also Angry Octopus,"I ordered the Book of ""Angry Octopus"" plus the cd of ""Indigo Ocean Dreams"" for my two grandchildren ages 5 & 3 1/2. They have hurt & angry feelings, due to the fact their retired military father was killed in a car accident three years ago. They are loving it. This book is so wonderful and the music is so relaxing that they are doing the breathing exercise. The 5 year old has just entered kindergarten, bringing in more changes to his life. It is wonderful for him to know a relaxing technique. Thank you for the awesome books & cds."
4,A nice way to drift off into an relaxing sleep,This is a great tool to help my daughter unwind and quiet her mind upon bedtime. I think that the stories are helpful in learning breathing and relaxation techniques.
3,Soothing,My 4 year old son likes to listen to the music and read the books. I was hoping for a relaxation miracle and didn't happen.
4,Cat Talk: The Secrets of Communicating With Your Cat,"I didnt expect to read about the authors life history from the beginning of this book. But I found it quite intresting and so far I have enjoyed reading this book. I am not finished yet, but I have learned how to communicate better with all my cats. I would reccommend this book to all animal lovers."
4,The test was MUCH easier!,"This book scared me, I was terrified to take the CHP exam, but the book overstates the test difficulty. Most helpful portions were the grammar portion (teaches you what to look for and the format of the questions) and the background check. If you are concerned about your review BUY THIS BOOK. otherwise think back to your highschool SAT and breathe a sigh of relief, its not that hard."
3,Pleasant,It was helpful like some parts were useful and other parts wasn't but it useful and gives u an idea of the test which is very helful
3,...,"I am a big fan of Moravia, but I consider this to be one of his worst novels. There are only 5 characters and the novel is 300+ pages long, which makes reading it sort of a bore. Not a complete failure, worthy of one star, but seems to be far inferior to everything else written by the author."
5,embury meets shatner,i dont think theres much more to describe the locust other than imagine a star trek army battling it out with phasers at a napalm death concert at the same time a plague of...insects of some sort swarm around...add a healthy dose of confusion to that and youve got the locust.
4,Loud Fast Rules,"Taking the punk aesthetic to its most illogical extreme, The Locust emit incredibly short blasts of furious lo-fi hardcore. Noisy guitars, chaotic vocals and cheesy keyboards...who could ask for more...a moth-eaten deer head? They've got that too."
1,This is..... talent?,"Is this the new ""cool"" thing to listen to? The powerviolence and punk madness that is sweeping the ""scene""? Lo and behold a few art-school hardcore rejects. If we play fast and messy we can be mistaken for talented folk."
1,This isn't music,"I just saw them last night before Andrew WK, and they are TERRIBLE. You people who listen to this are fools."
5,The Art of Howl's Moving Castle,"If you loved the movie, you will love this book, The Art of Howl's Moving Castle it's hard cover, with original sketches, storyboards and the final screenplay!The book explains every step of the complex story, from the original book adaptation to the final movie. Also have quotes and articles from creators of each process (designers, art directors, supervising animators, etc.) It's like seeing the movie scene by scene with artist commentaries."
5,GREAT FOR A GRAPHICS ART STUDENT,Purchased several art concept books for my daughter who is an art major in college. She loves anime so this was perfect to add to her other art concept books that she got for Christmas.
5,"Great Information, NOT your average SAT prep book","This book reveals what the real test takers who aced the SAT did to succeed, which no other book has ever done. What a bright idea! The book even created charts comparing what all the other SAT prep books recommend and what the 1600 kids say. There are differences that surprised me. The book takes it a step further than that, it shows how these high academic achievers have succeeded as students, and how parents can help their kids be successful in life. The book also has another use that is not that apparent because of the focus on the SAT. The commonalities found in the 1600 students serve as a guideline to prepare college applications and the essays. Their personal attributes are exactly what college admissions officers are using to select students from the pile, once you get past the scores and GPAs."
5,Dixieland by Three Great Bands,"Outstanding recordings by Pete Daily, Red Nichols, and the Fivehouse Five Plus Two. See my review on The Snader Telescriptions: Dixieland Jazz,Vol.2,the same recordings on VHS tape."
3,Solid projects,this book was a little less informative than the other two of the series that I own but still well worth owning.
4,Worth the money.,Like all things from Norm - well described as to how to make the piece. I just don't have all the tools he has - someday though.
5,Worlds best rose pruner,"One hand operation, plastic body, curved metal blades, leveraged ""advantage"". You can deadhead roses barehanded, even in the middle of the bush."
1,"Blech! Save your time, save your money","Images of old furniture in tacky layouts with bad curtains pretty much sums it up. And what the heck is with all the cats?! I thought I bought a book on interior design, not cats. Do not waste your time, do not waste your money. Mine will be for sale soon if you need one, you can just buy mine for a buck or two and save your cash for something better. If you really liked the 70's and 80's, you might like this book."
4,Mary O,"I liked this book and it gives one specific ideas on how to be more in tune with oneself and overcome burdens and boundaries. It is written simplistic, almost too much at times, as are Mary's other books I have read."
4,Inspirations and unique stories,"All of us want to believe our loved ones are still with us. ""Beyond These Four Walls"", simply written, Mary Rose Occhino helps us to understand, by all of her readings, this is possible. She comes across as believable. A very interesting and good read. I recommended this book to readers who had no previous interest in this type of subject, yet, nevertheless found her very helpful."
2,Regretted getting the full screen edition.,A good combination for Daniel Craig Fans. Much of the picture was loss due to full screen formatting.
2,very short,I think this is good as an introductory book. But there are better books out there with more descriptions on the subject than this.. I only bought this because it was required reading for a class.
2,could have been a 3 with 1 or 2 more action sequences.,"The movie starts off very well. It has the stock music that also plays in ninja checkmate and is very nicely applied here. There is a woman at the beginning who looks very good with a sword. She obviously has a double for a lot of these sequences, but when they show her face she looks pretty good. Then we meet lo lieh and along with a couple other good actors, I thought this looked pretty good. But there needs to be a story. If this was not kung fu, it would be fine. But it seems as cheap as any fu movie I have ever seen. And the fighting is not choreographed very well at all. I never felt excitement. So I somehow made it through this(fastforwarding over 20 minutes). And there is a great dramatic battle sequence at the end. I wish things leadign up to this would have been somewhat enjoyable so I may have felt something for the characters. The actress playing lo lieh's daughter was good, but no storyline and really no acting, this movie sucks."
4,Lots of Bang for Your Buck!,"I added 1GB of RAM (to 2GB) before even booting up out of the box, which I regret now, just for curiosity reasons, but so far I am very pleased with the twin-core MT6840. I had a Gateway MX7118 before and loved the widescreen display, and I wasn't about to spend a thousand or more bucks on a high-end laptop. I realize you get what you pay for usually, but if you're budget-conscious you could do a lot worse than the MT6840. Battery life is roughly 3 hours. Streaming HD TV video from ABC is flawless on the MT6840; the same video still stops and starts on my AMD Sempron desktop with 1.5 GB RAM. And so far, Vista has been a pretty pleasant experience. Like anything else new, it takes some getting used to."
5,6840,ive owned this laptop for about a year.i never had any problems with it.for the price i think its a great little laptop.
1,You are on your own with Gateway,"We bought a Gateway and Windows got hosed for some reason. We called 1-800-GATEWAY for support. Guess what? If you buy a Gateway anywhere but their website you must call a separate toll number. WTF!? Then we needed to restore it but the restore partition was bad. Had to get the recovery disk. They charged me $20 for a $1 CD-R. Then it wouldn't work, and they wanted to charge me to tell me how to use it. Again WTF? These people are horrible. Save yourself a lot of trouble and get a Mac. Get HP. Get an abacus. Anything but a Gateway."
4,Fun and easy,"I purchased this for my little guy when he had throat surgery, and I enjoyed more than he did! He just doesn't like anything that's ""different"" and it wasn't smooth and creamy like ice cream. I look forward to using it again this summer. It is also easy to create sugar-free recipes, so everyone can enjoy!"
4,Hit With the Kids,This has been a hit by the pool side. The only complaint I have it that the machine is a bit unsteady while grinding the ice.
4,Good quality for the money,"A GR8 way to stay cool during these horrible months in the extreme desert heat. So cheap to make and a lot tastier than anywhere you can buy them at ridiculously high prices for ice (aka water & usually free or cheap enough) & syrup....which, BTW, is very affordable. I'd have given this 5 stars if it wasn't so loud & didn't take so much effort pressing down the top to make ice come out. However, it does shave it extremely well & so far, so good as I use mine 2-3 times a day since I bought it nearly a month ago to make HUGE snow cones/slushies to help keep me cool."
5,Beautiful Book and wonderful photography,A book that is spectacular to look through and educational in content. A Christmas gift that was truly special.
4,Please disregard that previous review!!,"I have this set, and, all the songs on here are previously released studio tracks (except for a few live tracks),mostly album cuts,and some single only cuts.This is not fragments,false starts,incomplete demos,and silly chatter, as the previous reviewer stated.Maybe she has this confused with something else,or, maybe she's just plain confused.This is an excellent collection spanning Lennons' entire solo career(even contains the three best songs from the posthumously released ""Milk and Honey"" album)!!"
5,An aching chasm of pain rips right through my soul.,"Agonisingly beautiful - quite unsurpassed by any thing I have every heard. Provokes a strange gut wrenching agony which pervades. An aching chasm of pain and desolation. Profoundly & deversatingly moving and wretched. Other CDs by same composer with simialr ""Ouch factors"" are ""Preisner's Music"" and most recently ""Requiem for my friend"" composed by Zbigniew Preisner (as a farewell to his close friend the film director of The Double Life of Veronique, Krysztof Kieslowski, who died in in March 1996)."
4,"""Hot Trumpets"" is Very Warm Indeed","""The Hot Trumpets of Joe Newman and Harry 'Red' Allen"" is another one of my Oldies/Collectables website finds. It features two albums, originally made for Swingville, coupled on one Prestige reissue -- Joe Newman's ""Joe's Hap'nin's"" from 1961 and Henry ""Red"" Allen's ""Mr. Allen"" from a year later. Both of these trumpeters made their mark in the swing era, so they are a natural pairing despite the fact that the recordings have no shared personnel. The May 9th Newman session features Tommy Flanagan on piano, Wendell Marshall on bass and Billy English on drums, while the June 5th Allen date has Lannie Scott on piano, Franklin Skeete on bass and Jerry Potter on drums. Rudy Van Gelder's engineering on both performances is impeccable as usual, and it is a joy to hear Red in particular in a clear, modern setting. As this disc is going out-of-print, get ""Hot Trumpets"" while it's still warm."
5,"Great show, great music",Hearing this music reminds me of all the great episodes of this show. A must for any fan!
5,Girlfriend's review,"I bought this book for my girlfriend (the most avid of Friends' fans) as an annexation to her Christmas gift this past holiday and based upon what she says, it was really good. Now whether or not she is just saying that because I got it for her has yet to be determined but since she is usually a harsh criticizer of material that doesn't live up to her expectations, her positive review of this little book makes me believe it's a good addition to any Friends' fan's merchandise collection."
4,Nice book that explains the basic,Nice book for people needing to know the basic and how it works and where to find things. I keep it next to my advance book. This book well not go in to deeped. but it will get you started and expaines what it for and how it works.
2,Basic basic basic basic,"I was looking for a book that would give me a crash course on what's new in Windows 2003, but this book is just a crash course for someone who doesn't know anything about Windows. Maybe that's what it's supposed to be, so I guess I just missed the point, but this one got returned."
2,not the best book about Genene Jones,I read this book but it had a lot of un- information. I got more out of the movie. It does give a little info but not enought.
5,Very helpful,"This book has everything, meal guides, yoga and accupressure and other ways to get rid of your PMS symptoms, and they really work!!"
1,The title is a JOKE!!!,"The Hard and the Heavy is a misleading title for this compilation. I'm sorry, but Warrant, Poison and Whitesnake are not Heavy Metal!!Their glam rock posers who don't even deserve recognition as true musicians!!! Bring on Slayer,Morbid Angel,Cannibal Corpse, Carcass, Napalm Death and Suffocation and you'll truely have an collection of HEAVY!"
3,Mysterious menace,"As usual Howatch slips in some good writing in between the predictable Gothic formula. The protagonist is pretty but insecure and the hero is handsome, charming but not entirely trustworthy. This is not Howatch's best but is readable nonetheless."
2,Predictable,"I liked the main character, but as a gothic romance tale, this was very predictable. I could tell who the killer was pretty much from the beginning and how it was all going to turn out. Or perhaps I've just read too many gothic romances, as this is one of my favorite categories of books. However, I think a writer can remain in a genre and still come up with a unique, surprise ending as well as an entertaining book.All in all, this was a fast read and an interesting book."
1,Awful,"I think and hope that this is one of Ms. Howatch's earliest books. The characters were poorly drawn and since their motivations did not make any sense, neither did the plot."
1,Waste of Time and Money,"This lens fits onto the camera fine, but the image quality is poor at best. Every picture I took with it was cloudy, the colors distorted, and vignetting at the corners even at full telephoto zoom. I was sorely disappointed and felt burned by this purchase. I returned it to the seller, and am hoping to see a refund appearing shortly."
1,DO NOT BUY,"I just bought that game 'cause i heard a lot about that. yes that game was once famous. but now you can't run the game with the new MACs. I can't believe how come they do not update that game. When u try to install the game it says ""Classic Environment is not Supported"" and there is no way that you can run the game.I paid 15 bucks for nothing!"
2,Not the best album.,"This album its not the best one.I just liked 1 music.This album doesnt have musics like Silvia,My way, etc. I love camisa de venus remind me the old times, but I believe you should try another album."
4,The best album of Camisa,"In 1995 they came back with a live album. A year later, it was time for a new studio album. And what an album! Produced by the ""animal"" Eric Burdon (that makes a duet with Marcelo Nova in ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""), this record shows the band playing very good, with punch and rhythm. Songs like ""O Ponteiro Tá Subindo (The Pointer is Coming Up)"" and ""Radinho de Pilha (Battery Radio)"" are great rockabilly. ""Essa Linda Cano (This Beautiful Song)"" is a Rainy Day Woman-like song with brazilian breakthrough band Raimundos as guests. Great rock and roll."
3,Did not like illustrations,"I think that this book has some good ideas for beginners as far as (1) how to lay out fabric, (2) how to make basic slipcover patterns, etc.; however, the illustrations in the book are almost child-like in presentation."
5,Highly recommended,"(Planeta.com Journal) - This new guidebook covers all the angles for visitors to the U.S. Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix). Harry Pariser is one of our favorite authors and has also written about Costa Rica and Barbados. The travel essentials are well documented. Harry points out destinations for the nature tourist such as the St. Croix Aquarium and provides a guide to local plants and animals. Excellent!"
1,"Poor design, hard to ride","This is a very nice looking ride-on toy, but unfortunately it's very badly designed. The wheels at the back stick out from the car, so that when the kids push they bang their heels on the back wheels. We've had it for almost 4 years now, and even at the different ages (sizes) the kids always have trouble riding on it. If you want something to just sit on and look good, then this is the ride-on for you. If you want one that the kids can easily zip around on, shop around."
4,Scooby Hilarity.,"The Boo Brothers are Ghost's Who Hunt Ghosts.They are essentially ghosts of the Three Stooges.Shaggy, who has more uncles than anyone, has an uncle Beauregard whom has passed away and left him a southern plantation.He arrives to meet a Hunchbacked Renfield type butler.However, the area seems to be the center of another outbreak of the Hatfield and McCoy conflict ,and a Beauregard seems to be one side of it.AND, yes, a circus train has derailed nearby and the Sherrif is looking for an escaped Ape.It's a bit over the top, no doubt, but it's pulled off well.There is alot of fun to be had, even if it is preposterous.Not much less so than being kidnapped by Dracula to race a car or traveling to Louisiana to investigate the Ghost of Morgan Moonscar and finding Zombies and Werewolves."
3,Scooby Doo Meets The Boo Brothers review,"The Opening movie theme song is not great but still a pretty rockin' tune. The jokes are funny if you are between the ages of 1 and 10. The escaped gorilla subplot was nothing then a filler. The 1 time cast members like Sheriff Buzby,Billy Bob & his Sister were and still are stereotypical ""at best"" and I use that term loosely. The Boo Brothers were kind-of funny and they do help Shaggy & the Dogs here & there but I still think of them as a cheap 3 stooges knock-off. The Biggest pothole is this film is ""Why could'nt Shaggy's uncle just give him the treasure instead of making him find it with all of the clues?"" The animation is the best just like in Top Cat And The Beverly Hills Cats. The Movie itself is scary some times but funny most of the times. I give this a 6 out of 10."
3,A Classic Scooby/Shaggy/Scrappy Movie,"""Scooby Doo Meets the Boo Brothers"" is one of those classic late 70s/early 80s Scooby movies that stars just Scooby, Shaggy and ""power-pup"" Scrappy. Die-hard fans of Scooby will enjoy this, and the entertainment value for kids is high.The guys are sent to Shaggy's deceased uncle's mansion and run into a trio of ghosts--the Boo Brothers-- who are the 3 Stooges of ghostville. The guys have to solve riddles and clues to find the uncle's trasure, while running from bad guys, half-brained neighbors, and an overdeveloped girl.I don't think this one is as good as the new Scooby movies and I miss the rest of the gang. Kids will enjoy it though."
4,COOL,"This is one of scoobys best,I think its cool because it had real ghosts[the boo brothers]but still had the same classic comedy,and mystery solving its a really cool movie, for scooby fans of all ages!"
2,This was a looong boring movie......even for my 3 year old.,"I could not get into this movie at all. Other than the worst one, the Arabian Knights, this one was lame-o. It just kept dragging on and on and on....My 3 year old loves Scooby Doo and he was bored of this one. I would recommend at least watching it once just to say you watched it but nothing more than that."
3,this is a part.,"there is nothing wrong with this epson part. It is a replacement tank from a commercial grade wide format printer that soaks up discarded ink and needs to be replaced once full. Epson make the finest inkjet printers and are an industry standard in the world of print, prepress and design.I think I am being asked to review the product as I purchased it needing it overnight and paid about $18 to ship the $30 item and was not happy when it never arrived. Amazon did credit me for the shipping charges and agreed to resend the product for no additional charge since they were not able to provide any more tracking information than what I already knew. The original shipment arrived the following day and the resent item was never shipped/received which irritates when the right hand doesnt know what the left hand is doing. Next time, I will may think of other solutions for time sensitive stuff."
3,"Great ink, poor printer","I had no problem with the quality of the ink, but with my Epson CX 4800 it only seem to print 7 items, cards, papers, photos or a mixture of any of the 3 and then the ink ran out."
2,You can refurbish an ink tank,"The ink tank for the 4800/7800/9800 is a simple plastic box filled with paper absorbent. Thirty five bucks is way too much to pay for such a simple device. You can ""refurbish"" the tank with a roll of toilet paper. Remove the lid from the tank, remove the cardboard tube in the center of the roll and cut the toilet tissue in half with a bread knife. The two halves will just about fill the box to recreate the absorbent. Here's the kicker. The printer reads a chip on the tank and remembers the last two tanks, and maybe more. It will not let you reinsert and reuse a recently used tank even if it has been ""refurbished"". If you have a buddy with the same printer you can switch refurbished tanks to fool the printer."
4,Does what it says!,"Quickly replaced the ink storage tank in our Stylus Pro 4800, and regained the ability to print! Annoying that you have this part, and amazing to feel the difference in weight between a new and a used part. Just think of all the wasted ink! Alas, it's needed, and Amazon has a good price.Note that you should be careful when removing the old one, as it can be a little messy! Don't touch the (possibly still wet) ink!"
1,His class isn't all that either,I have read the book and taken the class at George Mason University where he teaches and boy are there a lot of mistakes in the book. He should publish another book (the errata). If you are considering taking this class don't.
2,I Just Don't Understand Why We Use This Book,"So far, my impression of this book is this. First, it's not very well written, and is often hard to understand. Concepts are not very well elaborated on. I'm having to go on the net to get better explanations... Second, I wish they would use more pictures for certain concepts, definately not a book for a visual learner. Honestly, I don't know why we are required to use this book for class, but I guess if I must, I'll use it. Professors should read this rating thing before they get these books... Hope this helps."
1,Pure Garbage,This book is one the worst books I have used. I took this class with one of the authors and this book seems to be really lacking and so does the author when it comes to teaching. Get something better. But you will probably be stuck with having to get this for the course since the homeworks are from this book.
1,The worst book I have ever read.,"The book is very poor on examples and the ones that it has do not make any sense. Topics like automata and removing nondeterminisim are not explained well enough(only one non-sense example for nondeterminism). Awful diagrams. It is not going step by step to understand Prolog and Lex. In short, if you have choice don't buy the book and if you have bought it already, don't waste time reading it. Unfortunately, I had not other option, I have bought the book and am reading it."
5,baby brat boy pendant,"I like my brat baby pendent that I got for my new grandson to wear with my others, however I still have not received the spacer that goes with it. It was sent by ups and I was not at home so they didnt leave it, now I dont know where it is but it has already been payed for, so what do I do?"
3,"Good, but not great.","This is really just middle of the road Hammond B-3 stuff here.Most of the songs are mid-tempo bluesy type numbers. Johnny Hammond Smith's playing is versitale enough at this speed that you don't get bored (like you do with say, Don Patterson).Still there's little that makes this record stand out from the 30 or 40 other B3 records I own."
2,Not everyone's cup of tea,"I did enjoy ""Scone""; however the constant bickering between the main characters in ""The Final Crumpet"" becomes extremely tedious after three hundred pages. Also, as we get further into the plot and the territory of cold-war spies and MI6, the whole thing begins to feel ridiculously far-fetched.Others have mentioned the presence of Christian messages, which seem awkward and out of place wherever they appear. It should be noted that the mission statement of the publisher is to, ""...publish and distribute inspirational products offering exceptional value and biblical encouragement to the masses."""
4,Book review,"I purchased the book, The Last Crumpet. The book was a little more bedraggled than I had expected, but it arrived promptly!"
5,entertaining,"This couple has a way of giving you several options of killers, and then come up with a totally surprising ending, at least for me. I tend to be an anglophile, so I love learning the British terms for some items. Using a tea museum is a quaint and creative setting. The ending wasn't as heartpounding for me as ""Dead as a Scone"", but I thouroughly enjoyed reading this sequel."
2,second-rate effort,"McMurtry's reputation must be carrying him, because this is strictly a second-rate effort, seemingly tossed off. Readers interested in Crazy Horse should read Win Blevins' glorious STONE SONG first and then Joseph Marshall's THE JOURNEY OF CRAZY HORSE."
4,A intresting Bio because of what little is Known about CH,"Very little history is known about this mythic man Crazy Horse, but many historians are willing embelish when there is not enough to write about. This book does not embelish, but tells the story of Crazy Horse through those who effected his life. the story shows Crazy Horse as a loner who love his privacy but was often forced to give it up for the action needed at the time. The book was well referrecned and often will state when a story may be from a questionalbe sorce. It is an easy read and covers history that is often ingnored. Crazy Horse is more a history of the Americas than a biography, but that does reduce its worth."
3,Quick short story of one man's extraordinary achievement,This nice but not lengthy booklet does some justice to the saga of Crazy Horse. It tries to make us realize just how much mystery there is to this leader of the Sioux people. A great bibliography at the end makes it a good stepping stone to further knowledge. Thanks Larry!!!AJ FAL
1,It Sucked!,"While musing over what to write for a review of this atrocious attempt at literature, one of my students said, ""just say it sucked."" IT SUCKED!"
4,"Superbly written, though somewhat imaginative.","Let it be clear from the outset that this is a highly positive review! McMurtry is a wonderful writer, and those not too concerned with the precision of historic detail will find this book a great read. It is entertaining and informative at the same time, and does much to remind us of a part of history we're not particularly proud of. As one who has written Native American history as seen through contemporary eyes, I know how difficult it is to find an accurate record. But McMurtry demonstrates that the detail that may be lacking isn't necessary to provide a full and no doubt highly accurate account of the larger context into which heroes--Native American or otherwise--must be viewed. This is authentic, and if it attracts a wide following it will have performed a valuable service: We all need to know this story better."
3,Economic & abbreviated...but lacks compassion,"McMurtry has created a lean novella from the minimal amount of factual knowledge known about this Strange Man of the Oglalas. He cuts efficiently through the lengthy & speculative romanticism that weighed down previous biographies. We see Crazy Horse before the legend muddied the waters. We see more of the man. But McMurtry seems to completely disregard the Lakota oral tradition and removes his subject from that perspective...a 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' situation. If you're looking for an intimate portrait of the man...wade through Mari Sandoz' excellent biography...tempered with McMurtry's clarity. But if you're looking for ""just the facts, ma'am"", then I suggest a quick three hour session with Larry McMurtry."
1,Mcmurtry seemed almost flippant regarding Lakota issues.,"I did not like this book much at all. I think McMurtry needed to do much more research regarding Lakotas, Crazy Horse, and the Plains Indian Wars of the mid 1900s. I wonder if he spoke or consulted with any Lakota people regarding this work. It would seem he did not. This book doesn't do justice for the topic."
3,Extremely weak,"I bought this book after visiting the Crazy Horse monument in South Dakota, and I wanted to learn more about Crazy Horse.Do not waste you time or money on this book. The information in this book is extremely weak.Please E-mail me if you have questions or comments about my review. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda ""We give thanks Great Spirit"""
1,Flimsy,"McMurty starts off by saying not much was know about Crazy Horse and then goes on to tell the reader exactly that, not much. The book is only 140 pages but McMurty could have told his story in 20 pages.I get the distinct feeling he doesn't even like native Americans, at least not this one."
1,McMurtry should stick to fiction; that's what this book was!,"From what I've seen in this book the ONLY thing McMurtry got right was the date Crazy Horse died. It should have a big disclaimer printed on the front of the book: ""This book is a work of fiction!""McMurtry has the audacity to malign other writers and researchers for their conclusions and then he proceeds to do the same poor job of second guessing. Throughout the book he continually guesses at where Crazy Horse might have been or what he might have been doing. For the love of writing . . . if you don't know then say so. Don't just write to sell something!The book was the WORST I've bought in years! I've demanded my money back, and I think McMurtry owes us all a big apology for wasting our time!"
3,Interesting but not exciting,"The material in this biography of the elusive Crazy Horse is informative and interesting, but my husband and I were a little disappointed that Larry McMurtry didn't write in a style more like his engrossing novels. That's sort of what we were expecting based on some of the blurbs about the book. Still, we learned a lot about the man behind the enormously impressive sculpture going up in the Black Hills. If you are interested in him, this is a short and information-packed read."
3,a very politically correct view,"There is too much political correctness in this book to really get a good view of Crazy Horse other than some mythic figure of the Great Plains. At this discount it's a good read; the book is lite on facts and has allot of speculation & one gets the feeling that Larry rushed this out just to have his say & not really research this Ogalla warrior or his life and times.It just has a rushed feeling to it. In the end, it's really just a preface to the Ambrose book, though a little long for one."
1,Don't bother,"Unless you're interested in the inner musings of McMurtry, don't bother with this hefty-priced, hard-bound 'pamphlet.' I knew very little about Crazy Horse before reading this book and just as little upon finishing it. I'd like to read several of the other volumes in this series, but I feel so ripped off by this one that I won't buy another."
1,McMurtry unqualified,"What are McMurtry's qualifications to write about Crazy Horse, one wonders? Does he know the Lakota people? Has he lived among them? Has he heard their oral tradititions? Does he have the vaguest idea of what Crazy Horse means to Crazy Horse's people? In general, James Atlas, editor of the Penuin series of short biographies, is on the right track in not seeking academic scholars and similar authorities to write these books, but SOME expertise, one would think, would not be amiss, especially in dealing with a figure so lost in myth as this compelling Oglala. The best book on Crazy Horse is STONE SONG by Win Blevins. It is a novel. McMurtry also writes novels and needs to stick to the form."
2,makes these innocent boys seem so guilty!,"what scares me about this book is that had i not known anythiing about this case and just picked it up[which i often do]i would have thought it was great.the writing is great,etc.HOWEVER,i have seen both paradise lost tapes and it is a whole other story,really.iam so glad to see that so many other reviewers feel the same.i URGE anyone who reads this to watch the tapes!!i am a huge free the west memphis three supporter and if i had only read this book,i might have thought they were guilty."
2,Sensational and biased,"This got 2 stars because, for a long time, this was the only book about the West Memphis Three case. A much superior book, ""Devil's Knot"" has been released recently andI recommend that over Blood of Innocents. For the most part, this book is written from the official perspective that Damien, Jason and Jessie are guilty of the crimes they were convicted of. It focuses heavily on the writings of Damien Echols which prove nothing except that he was a disturbed teen while ignoring or glossing over the evidence pointing away from the three. This is your garden variety true crime book full of lurid detail but little substance."
2,"Good companion with ""Devil's Knot""","Although this book seemingly attempts to present Damien, Jesse and Jason as guilty; the authors piece together a poor attempt at presenting hard evidence that the three had anything to do with the Robin Hood Hills Murders.While there are a lot of facts left out of this outdated book, and while new evidence has surfaced, as well as some of the testimony being recanted or proven false, I found it a good companion to Devil's Knot by Mara Leveritt.I also encourage any reader of this book that is not familiar with the case to do some extra research...there are a TON of people online that have been very willing to help and answer questions if you are confused.As long as you don't rely on everything this book has within it as fact, and it is used as a companion with new and current information, I suppose it is worthwhile."
2,"Read ""Devil's Knot"" first!","This book is long on supposition and short on objective fact. In a nut shell, the book seems to say ""The WM3 are guilty-take my word on it-don't be confused by facts, the story flows so thats all you need to know."" Unfortunately the Arkansas penile system (and jury pool)seems to think this way too. The book is a must read for anyone interested in the case...if for nothing else than to get into the heads of the other side."
4,Blood of Innocents,"This book is very interesting. As I have followed the case extensively, it did retell a lot of what I already knew... This book is a few years old so it is missing a lot of the current evidence and case info but is a good background book."
1,Big Time Bias,This terribly biased book portrays the West Memphis Three as guilty and evil. Skip it and read Devil's Knot and watch the movies instead.
3,Could Have Been A Lot Better,"After watching an interesting documentary about the case featured on HBO, I bought the book in hopes of learning more. Unfortunately, this book is very dull and tends to focus more on the landmarks of neigboring towns than it does the case itself. The background and interests of the ""alleged killers"" are vague and definitely need to be worked on. In addition to the poor profiling of the accused, there was also very little information about the crime scene. The ""shocking photos"" really aren't all that surprising. In fact, I found them to be quite dull. What could have been a very interesting, dark book turned out to be a lame attempt at capturing innocence lost."
2,Biased and incomplete...,"I read this book when it first came out in 1995, and the best thing I can say about it is that it ignited my interest in this case. Although the book is completely biased, I found enough inconsistencies and doubts to continue researching the case. In the years since, many new details have emerged and with them an ever-growing group of supporters who believe in the innocence of the boys that were convicted.I hope that anyone who reads this book does so with an open mind and a willingness to learn more about the case. I would strongly recommend viewing the ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills"" and ""Paradise Lost 2: Revelations"" movies as well as reading ""Devil's Knot"" by Mara Leveritt and visiting the website - www.wm3.org."
4,"Not Smith's best, but still good.","Of course this is not as good as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn; matching that would be an impossible feat. But it is still an interesting look into the life of a young woman in early 20th century Brooklyn. Yes, it's sometimes depressing; so is life. Smith's point in all of her novels is that there is always hope. Dignity can be found in the seemingly least important lives, and life's joys and sorrows are shared by us all."
5,Fun and interesting historical book,"I found this book not only historically and culturally interesting, but it was also very easy and entertaining to read. It covered a broad spectrum of women and was full of fascinating little bits of information. I also noticed the lack of documentation, which might affect the integrity of the book for some readers. As a Revolutionary War reenactor, I enjoyed this book very much."
1,Founding Mothers = poor writing,"I was very disapointed in this book. It goes from one topic to another with no footnotes or primary sources as to where this information comes from. It lists every stereotype of women and family life you could imagine. There is a list of ""Suggestions for Further Reading"" but no bibliography of any sort to back up what has been written as ""fact"".There are no pictures or photographs of anything except those small illustrations for chapter heading.As a research book it is very poor and expects the reader to take on face value the authors assertation with no backup."
2,Where are all the high fructose monkeys?,"Cause this stuff has it, Lea & Perrins doesn't!But thats not why I'm rating this so low. It gets two stars because its terrible,a thin watery pitiful substitute for L&P; that does no justice to any dish, andespecially not to a Bloody Mary.Heinz is a pretty good brand name, I have never understood why they cant get thisright. Check it yourself, pull a bottle from the shelf, turn it upside down and seehow quickly it runs down the sides leaving nothing behind. I suppose if you cookedthis down to about a 60% solution it would be ready to use, but right out of thebottle its a pretty weak substitute for real Worcestershire sauce. I did have abottle of this that I fortified with a Tsp of anchovy paste and it tasted much better."
5,Great to have for the RV,Got these for use with the RV. Don't want to be out somewhere and blow a fuse and loose power...etc...... A good selection.
3,How many fuses are too many?,"This is a great kit but looking at it now, I don't know when I will have occasion to use all of these. An average car owner can likely get away with a much smaller set."
3,Good Book,"Professor Hoff, late of Indiana University, tries to rise above the Watergate mania that tends to totally overshadow all the other accomplishments that occurred during the Nixon administration. Let there be no doubt that Nixon was NOT a doctrinaire conservative, if he was even one to begin with. Nixon's early cabinet and advisers included some liberal minds. It is now known that many economic policies that were implemented during this time were very injurious to the US economy (wage and price controls come to mind) and contributed to the awful economic times of the late 70's and early 80's.Nevertheless, this book is a good start if you want to learn a little bit about what went on besides Vietnam and Watergate."
4,Revisionism Reconsidered,"Hoff tempers her examination of Nixon with balanced criticism and muted praise in places but remains quite impartial overall. Naturally, a reader may find anything he seeks in an interpretation of the words of the author yet there is no obvious bias or partisanship on the part of Joan Hoff in this work. The amount of revisionism, however, is quite substantial. Hoff seems to have as her purpose for writing this a decided motivation to revise the history of Nixon from the accounts given by fellows ranging from Ambrose to Wills. Granted, her work is more informed and well rounded compared to Ambrose and less agonizing than Wills' Nixon Agonistes yet there seem to be a lack of entirely new information, which would make this work a better choice for the average reader looking for an unbiased, middle of the road examination of Nixon."
2,Learn to sift,This book would probably be a very interesting account if it wasn't bogged down with so many minute details that take away from the overall argument. Ms. Hoff has some great ideas but the book could realistically have been much more concise.
4,Pretty solid bluetooth,"Very nice bluetooth, a little bit big for my taste, but very solid feeling and does the job. Very good sound, fits nicely on my ear, and I love the car charger. Other than the slightly large size and look of it, its a great headset!"
4,A headset that works!,"Very good sound quality and easy to use; Excellent battery life!A little uncomfortable when worn for long periods of time (2+ hours)Now using this with my iPhone 4. Only one complaint, the charger doesn't lock in to the headset and frequently falls off when charging."
4,Not great but ok,"Pros:* loud* comfortable* easy to swap left to right side* lightweight* cradle with car charger is convenient* good battery lifeCons* static can be heard occasionally if weared on the left ear while the phone is in the right pocket. I had compared with Motorola HS810 - Motorola sounds ok, looks like it has better bluetooth receiver.But most of the time the sound is clean, so it's not a very big problem* weird strong LED flashes every 5sec all the time connected to phone, feel yourself an Airbus with signal lights :) Can be fixed with black permanent marker though :)"
3,Plantronics Explorer 350 REivew,"Best headset I've had so far. I had a Motorola H500, which was a POS. It was so bad I stomped it and threw it on the garbage. There's no echo with the Plantronics Explorer 350 at all. Love in the in-ear piece. I notice once you're about 6 feet away from the phone you get static. In addition, when it's on the opposite side of your body (i.e. ear piece in left ear, phone in right pock) you get static. It's not enough where you not able to hear your call, but slightly annoying. However, the caller doesn't seem to hear the static.Sound on the headset is great. Battery life is great as well. Charger is pretty stupid as it doesn't come with a typically wall charge. Instead it comes with a usb charger.Overall, I think it's pretty good for the money. No major compliants here."
4,one great headset,"This is a great headset. Everything is loud and clear and it's a great value at 35 bucks. Battery life is also impressive, I've had this headset for 3 weeks and I haven't needed to charge it since the initial charge."
4,nice product,"This bluetooth is for my wife,who has small ears,and this earpiece has a inner speaker that helps keep the earpiece balanced in and on her ear,great product."
2,It Died,"This is third different Plantronics bluetooth ear piece and they all were very thinty. However, this one died very quickly. I am not satisfied with this product nor Amazon. All the ear pieces that I purchased online seem to be defective units. I would recommend purchasing at a store."
2,Poor Plantronics,"I returned the headset. The casing is cheaply put together. With the headset on and the phone (Samsung SGH-a707) stationary I cannot walk more than 5 feet away without hearing much objectionable static. Talk time is ok. I purchased the Plantronics Voyager 510. This one is so much better,it's a difference between day and night. I can walk approximately 25 feet away, down the hall and into another room and still hear very well. I hear only a slight amount of static after I reach the far side of the room near a window.Don't buy the BT350, it's worth the extra cash to purchase the Voyager 510. I like the Voyager 510 better than the Motorola H500 too. I'll try and review the 510 soon."
3,Another Bluetooth earpiece,"I got this because a friend recommended it. It is better than all the others I have tried, but I can't recommend it.The earpiece fits OK, but I can't angle the microphone down without also changing the anchoring to my ear. The fidelity is mediocre. Battery life is also mediocre, even when it is turned off, which is most of the time."
1,D.O.A.,"Maybe this is a great unit however, I'll never know. Charged it up and it would never power on. Returning and am just going with a Motorola"
3,Convenient with Drawbacks,"I bought this because of the ease of keeping it charged by having a cradle to store and charge the unit when not in use. This functionality is great. However, the unit picks up road noise more than most. Since going to this headset I get complaints from the person on the other end of the call that it sounds like I'm in water when I go over a certain speed. This took some time to isolate, but is definitely the wind noise from outside my vehicle. While it isn't the quietest vehicle, other headsets I've used have never had this problem.Final thoughts: If the noise reduction for the unit were improved this would be a 5 star product."
2,Static,"I bought this model because of the in-ear bud. I had tried others that just sat on top of the ear. The on-ear never felt comfortable or locked-in.This model is adequate, but nothing special. Regardless how far I am away from the phone or laptop, I hear steady static. I've paired it to my phone (Palm Treo 650), my laptop (Dell Latitude D620) and my fiance's phone (Samsung SGH-D807). All are about the same in terms of the static. Listening to music from the laptop is really bad and low quality, but that's not the main usage model for this device. As a cellphone headset, it's just OK.My fiance has the Plantronics Discovery 655. That's a much better device and well worth the extra money."
1,Customer Service Nightmare,"I received this product and thought that I was doing something wrong in trying to get it to work properly. It had been recommended by a friend who purchased the same thing and uses it frequently on a daily basis. Even she looked at it all to no avail. Numerous calls to the number resulted in either a long wait [I gave up many times and never spoke to someone], people who were unable to assist me, even after a long wait, and ultimately a person who informed me that nothing could be done to replace the product which was not working. I shouldn't have to pay more to get a product that should have been working properly in the first place."
2,Where do we start,"This look like a pretty good deal but I'm not impressed. My device has not yet charged after being on the charger for some 8-10 hours, although the light on my car charger is red. But I guess you get what you pay for. Overall, this thing would've been great had it actually worked."
1,Arrival disappoinment,"This is the second one I have bought in 30 days from Amazon ..... and the second one that doesnt work on arrival. I would think that I was maybe doing something wrong .... except for the fact that I had both of them on a wall charger for overnight and they were still indicating they were charging in the morning. VERY disappointed, as I find the plantronics to be the most comfortable fit for me. Well, time to return this one and try for number 3."
2,Don't buy 2 of them,"I bought 2 of these, one for my wife and myself. I did a few tests and it seemed to work well... until I called my wife while she used her headset. The sound would continually cut out, and a conversation was possible. At first I thought it must be interference because we were in the same room. So we tried it again on the road when we were over 10 miles apart, but could only get the same results. Customer support was no help at all."
5,superb key to Johnny Guitar style,I have had this dvd for a while now and i reiterate my 5 star view. There is no tab book but I think its better insome ways because you follow Al Eck's lesson to get the licks slowly and when you're ready play Johnny doing each track and try to keep up or initially play rhythm with him. Attempting to play along with Johnny on screen is brilliant.
5,Great Reference Book!,"I've read 5-6 books on Alexander the Great, but never really understood the sequence of the battles between the Macedonians and the armies of Asia. This book laid them out in great detail! I wish I would have had this book before I read the others. My understanding of Alexander's campaigns would have been much clearer. It doesn't go into a lot of detail, but it does highlight the important facts. Highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Alexander the Great!"
5,One of the Best,"Alexander 334-323 BC: Conquest of the Persian Empire (Campaign Series 7) by John Warry is one of the best of the Osprey Campaign Series. Unlike most to the other books, Alexander does not focus on a given battle or a series of battles, but on the almost decade long conquest of Persia and neighboring countries, such as parts of India. If one is looking for an overview of Alexander's conquests then there is probably no better book. The battles are described in such a manner as to acquaint the reader with the ins and outs and the maps are beyond excellent.Warry does a fine job in explaining how 50,000 infantry and cavalry troops were able to defeat an empire with troops several times their number. Focusing on the the tactical brilliance of Alexander and the innovations in battle field technologies, the book explains why Alexander was victorious. It is written in a readable fashion and is a good place to start for anyone who is interested in the conquests of Alexander."
3,The Campaigns of Alexander the Great,"John Warry's Osprey book is a fairly typical condensed account of Alexander's most important battles; Granicus, Issus, Tyre, Gaugamela, and the Hydaspes. This is a solid but uninventive source, most of its information being availible in dozens of other books and in greater depth. The bird's eye maps of the Campaign series are of poor quality here (due at least in part to this being one of the first Campaign titles) though they suit their purpose well enough. One little detail this title does contain that many do not are several uncommon color illustrations of Indian warriors of Porus' Army (a topic Osprey really needs to do a book on).Overall, this is a decent quality source on Alexander by an experienced researcher of the Classical Art of War, but don't expect a huge amount of detail or any startling new revelations."
3,book,good book on the ancient wars in the middle esat big fan on this subject good illustratetion good picture good
1,Obscure and difficult describe this instruction book,"We received this book/kit this Christmas and excitedly broke into it as a family event. We are three adults with varying levels of education (through post-graduate) and three children to 9 years old. We tried the Giraffe first and were immediately frustrated by the instructions. The pictures are insufficient and the instructions are obscure. It seems the author was attempting to give the shortest description possible and by this effort left out needed information.Independently and as a group we tried to understand his instructions by experimenting for over an hour. The purpose of the book is to eliminate experimentation and teach you how to ""do"" the work, it fails.I would NOT recommend this book/kit to anyone. There are other books which show and explain origami much better than this one. Working with this book is an exercise in frustration."
1,Has horrible descriptions!,"This book starts out as your everyday casual origami book. However, as you work through the models, several flaws show up. First, no mention is made to explain the various folds for beginners. Second, the descriptions of each step are complicated and useless to anyone, save for origami masters. If you're a beginner, DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!!!!! It is horrible, and is not considered traditional anyhow. Thank you."
2,"Boring, not informative","I read this with my 9 year old son who has tourette syndrome. Neither of us got much out of the book. Too short, even for the price."
2,NOT for the younger kids,"I am SOOOO glad I just decided to read this before sharing it with my 7 year old, recently diagnosed son. There is no way I'd allow him to read this. It is too disturbing for a young, recently diagnosed child. While I do not discount Adam's feelings, I think it is too upsetting for younger children to hear about thoughts of wanting to die. Also too much reference to feeling ""crazy"". I am trying to convince my son he is wonderful and special. I understand that this is how Adam felt and likely how my son feels to some extent, but these concepts are for older children.I will hold onto the book for when he is older and may share it with him then."
3,interesting,"This book covered a lot of generations, I wanted to know more about my original character, who kind of got lost."
5,A wonderful treat!!,"A member of my Book Club suggested this for our next book, so I figured I'd give it a try. Within the first few pages I was engrossed and hated to put my book down! I loved how the author used different ""voices"" for each chapter, enabling the reader to get different perspectives on events that happened to this family. I found myself having wishes and dreams for the characters as if they were my own children. I enjoyed this book so much I'm planning on reading it again before my book club meets. Also recommend: The Kite Runner"
3,"Rice Mother - exotic, beautiful and not to be trusted","The Rice Mother is a lyrical, exotic tale about a powerful matriarch, Lakshmi, who is married off at 14 and goes on to have six children, endure the Japanese ocupation of Malaysia, and guide her offspring through their various encounters with addiction, love, power and heartbreak. Rani Manicka's tale is bursting with exotic sights and smells, food and culture, mysticism and metaphor.So why only three stars? I know a lot of people loved this book, but I found it painful to read. After an engaging beginning that sucks the reader into caring about these characters, Manicka is just too cruel to them. The violence and horror that this family suffers was too much for me - further, it seemed unnecessary. In my head I envisioned a hundred alternate endings (ie Mohini dashing into the woods, Dimple and her husband communicating), and Manicka's plot just didn't convince me that her tragic path was the right one."
3,great writing but holes in plot,"I'm not going to rehash the plot but the author has an engaging style of writing that grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go. The fact that the magic doesn't really work is easy to overlook. People die and simply disappear. Things are left unexplained. The father is taken off and tortured by the Japanese and never mentions it in his own story.There was an underlying anti-Chinese tone to the book which bothered me. It was subtle but definately there. There was no misinformation but the attitude was playing in the background the whole time. Very strange...Having been to Malaysia and having lived in China, it was an interesting read for me."
2,Physical Beauty Trumps All Else,"While I found the book to be well-written and compelling as it explores life through the perpectives of 3 generations of diverse and interesting family members, I was irritated by its emphasis on physical beauty.The overall importance & worth of each character seemed totally dependent on how physically beautiful they were--and consequently, everyone else (regardless of their soundness of character, level of kindness, etc) was portrayed as deeply & irreparably flawed. Perhaps the author sees the world that way, but hopefully most others outside the book do not."
3,Good start,"I was totally absorbed with the first half of this book, but I lost interest in the later generations of the family. I began to skim and actually skipped the last 40 or so pages. I have never stopped reading a book after getting in 400 pages before."
3,Racism and mediocrity despite the glowing reviews,"I bought Rice Mother on the strength of reviews I read here. Unfortunately, I did not find the book as compelling as the reviewers. On the one hand, Manicka's writing can be lyrical and conjures up Malaysia nicely. On the other, the plot is less probable and she doesn't flesh out her non-protagonist characters. However, it is the rapant racism which prevents me from recommending this book to friends. All Japanese characters are depraved. This might be forgivable for during the Japanese occupation portion, but it continues after wartime. All darker skinned characters are stupid or lazy. In contrast, the lighter skinned characters are intelligent, talented and kind, until and unless circumstance and experience turn them bitter. All in all, this book could be better."
5,"Excellent- if you struggle with pronunciation, this a valuable tool","I bought this method not really expecting much from it but I was pleasantly surprised! I have yet to complete all the lessons but so far I think they it`s really quite excellent. The book that comes with it is incredibly detailed and very useful. For those that require the IPA symbols they are also included as well as diagrams of how to position your mouth. For the price of the method it really is fantastic and it surpassed all my expectations. I live in France but struggle with my accent and pronunciation and let me tell you, it can be an incredible handicap. I haven`t yet finished the lessons but I feel as though I have already made a marked improvement. If you can`t take a French phonetics course at La Sorbonne than I suggest you buy this method, the makers themselves have studied there so you're really getting the next best thing!"
1,Pronounce it perfectly in French,"This was the first time I ordered from amazon. I ordered french audio cds and received 3 blank CDs. Before discovering that I had recieved blank CDs I had already ordered another 2 audio books, hopefully I receive content and not just a cover."
2,I recieved 3 cds but the cd number 2 was repeated.,"I recieved a huge surprise when I was going to transfer my audio cds to my laptop , and then to my cell phone I have two copies from cd number 2 . I was really disappointed . how this things could be happended ? . I apreciatte if some of the users could please give me one copy from cd number 3 ( mp3 format ) should be better .if somebody have 2 copies from cd number 3 we can change it or i can send it in digital format either. :)the cd 3 begins in lesson 7"
2,"Wonderful bio and story--little ""how to"" on direct marketing","Lester Wunderman, the father of direct marketing, is a great salesman and has a super story to tell. If you want to know more about Mr. Wunderman's life or the history of direct marketing then this book is for you. However, the book promises to deliver on ""making advertising pay"" and it simply doesn't. What techniques you learn about direct marketing are antidotal and have to be mined from a lot of ore. The first few pages enumerate Mr. Wunderman's 19 principles which is about the only direct how-to we get."
3,The Evolution of Direct,"Wunderman provides a glimpse into a long and prosperous career in the direct advertising industry. Emphasizing the journey and the road to discovery rather than the actual destination, this book outlines how and when key direct marketing concepts were created, where he employed them, and the results which were achieved. I liked this book but it did take me some time to plow through it. I struggled to remain focused through parts of the book but, overall, it was a pretty enjoyable read."
5,A look at the changing business-consumer relationship,"Now in an updated second edition, Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay presents the wisdom and practical experience of advertising legend and direct marketing pioneer Lester Wunderman, perhaps best known for his guidance behind the ubiquity of the American Express card, the creation of the Columbia Record Clob, and the well-known L.L. Bean. Although Being Direct focuses especially upon successful direct marketing, the experiences recounted within the pages are critically important to any business striving to get the most out of its advertising budget. From inventing new direct marketing media to how to successfully start an advertising agency to speculations of changes in the future and more, Being Direct is an eye-opening look at the changing business-consumer relationship from the point of view of a man who not only adapted to modern revolutions of information technology, but put them to use for success beyond anyone's dreams."
3,60+ years Old.,"I like reading some of the older books written on various aspects of the Civil War. Stan Horn's book is often quoted in many of the bibliographies of more recent vintage. Despite its age, it remains a key work on the Confederacy's war plans in its Central theater of operations. It is remarkably devoid of Confederate excuses.The book focuses on the performance of the Army of Tennessee and Horn places the blame for its poor performance where it belongs, on the Confederacy's High Command. He does an unusually good job with the bickering that occurred in key command positions, analyzes Jeff Davis' curious support for Braxton Bragg and lays the blame for this Army's ultimate destruction under John Bell Hood where it belongs, at the feet of Jeff Davis.Well written and researched, it is a book well worth the time."
1,NOT FOR BIG DOGS,This toy did not last long for my choc. lab. He ripped the end in 1 day. May be good for light chewers.
5,Best Gift I Ever Gave,"Bought this gift for our three year old granddaughter. Hestitated to do so because she has a one year sibling. However, both children have really enjoyed the rollercoaster. In addition, it gives indoor fun and wears off excess energy when the kids can't play outdoors."
4,really fun for my three children!,This toy is really fun! My five year old loves it just as much as my 17 month old. We move it all around the yard and have never had a problem with putting it back together or taking it apart. I like the part that we can break it down and pu it away if we need.
5,Great toy!,My 2 year old has this. It's loads of fun for him and was a breeze to put together as it just snaps right together. He plays with it everyday :)He also has it at his playgroup and all the kids there fight over it because it's so much fun haha
4,Roller coaster,"I bought this for my 2 year old in may for her birthday. EVERY kid at the party had a blast with it. Its been about a month and she still loves it, but does not play with it every day. Its one of those type of toys that is super fun if there is more then one child playing with it, but my daughter being an only child gets bored with it easily. She has ALOT of fun when her dad pushes her on it though. Overall its a great toy, but dont expect your kid to play with it daily. $100 Is not a bad price though, and delivery was super fast."
1,Overwhelming,"My 2 yrs old LOVES it... but what a nightmare. It is HUGE. Takes a ton of space, 10 feet for the coaster and then several more for the roll out. My son need help with it and it is a ""job"" toy. He may enjoy it but he's fallen off a couple of times, and we live up north so keeping it outside isn't a great option AT ALL. There are a lot of other toys he can enjoy that don't span entire rooms and require constant attention. I have another baby on the way and can't wait to get rid of this thing."
1,Lame toy.,Got this for my daughter as an extra special gift for her 2nd bday. Its a big plastic piece of junk. Its not that fun. I have no idea how it got so many 5 stars. She went down this little hill and was bored after two rides. She never looked at it again - and this huge thing was hard to miss. We returned it and got her the jump-o-lene which she is crazy about. Save your money.
2,For ages 2 and under,"I bought this for my 2-year-old last Christmas, based on the positive reviews and description. When I received it, I was surprised how short the track was. Clearly I didn't understand how short 10 feet of track is. Case in point, my 2-year-old literally took one ride on it and said he was done. I kept it out for several more days and he didn't take one look at it. This toy may last a child from ages 1-2, but that's about it. The car is kinda fun and a child might like scooting around it without the track, but this set really only works for young toddlers under age 2. It is colorful and well constructed, and easy to assemble, but don't be fooled by the photos that make you think your older toddler will get much out of it."
5,This is AWESOME,"EVERYONE who comes to play at our house LOVES this toy. It's very durable and has held up in the 2 years we've had it (not sure the weight limit on it but I even tested it out when I first set it up). We use it indoors and it's great. It does take up a little bit of space because it is long and then you need some run out room at the end for the car to go, but we have the space so that wasn't an issue for us."
5,AWESOME TOY! Well worth the $,"We bought this for our 2 year old son for Christmas. He absolutely LOVES it, and the way it is made he can completely do it himself. It has great little steps on each side and the car fit into deep grooves which makes it easy for him to put in on the track easily and safely. This was a hit for all the kids..age 10, 6, 4 and 2.(and a few crazy adults!). We don't have a lot of extra money, but we honestly felt like as much fun as the kids have had on it for 2 days, even if it broke in a month it would be worth the money! I don't think it will though..very strong pastic and the track is very sturdy. The car is even fun to ride on the sidewalk as well. I can't imagine any child not having a BLAST on this! :)"
5,Gotta get this,"I am not going to go into a long review here. But this thing is great. We bought it for our 28 month old, and he loves it. The first time he went down, he had the biggest smile on his face. We had to load him on and then push him. I quickly (after 4 rides) how to push it back onto the track and up the ramp, and lock in the wheel holds. Then showed him how climb the steps and get on and then push it off himself. I was actually pretty shocked on how quickly he was able to do this himself, considering he still wants us to hold his sippy cup and all.But it is very well built and takes all of 1 minute to put together.Hopefully he doesn't get too bored with it too quickly."
4,roller coaster review,"Great product - well made. Grandson enjoys it. Takes up approximately 12-15 feet in length. Make sure you have the space for it. Assembly and take down is easy. Product was on sale and shipping was free therefore price was right, Shipping could be expensive."
5,All kids love this toy,I work at a day care center and all the kids I watch love this track. They giggle when the ride ends and the are still coasting on the wood floor. One of the more easy toys to put together. I also like that you can use the car to ride on without the track. Great item for all kids under 80ish lbs.
5,Great Roller Coaster Fun In the Back Yard,"Length:: 0:27 MinsI purchased the Step 2 Up & Down Roller Coaster for my granddaughter. She is almost 3 years old. This is the best riding toy for a young child because she enjoys riding it so much. She looks forward to riding the coaster every day. She would ride the coster all day if she could.The coaster car travels an amazingly long distance even on dirt and grass. The coaster and track is made of strong plastic and seems indestructable.Even the 7 year old girl next door enjoys riding the coaster too, so it is a toy that will give a child enjoyment for years.After checking prices, I found that Amazon had the best price for the Step 2 Up & Down Coaster. Shipping was also free with Amazon Prime.When I see how happy my granddaughter is riding the coaster, the price of it is small for so much fun, smiles and laughter."
5,My 2 yr old loves this!!!,"I saw this item on a ""Christams in July"" special on QVC in 2001 and I thought it would be great for my daughter when she got a bit older. On her 2nd birthday a family member asked what to get her and I suggested this item which was now available as Toys R Us. My daughter loves this little roller coaster. She plays with it quite often and when she doesn't play with the roller coaster part she wheels herself around the house on the little cart. This coaster is very durable and steady. I don't have to worry about her tipping over to the side and hurting herself. It may be a bit pricy for some people but I think it is well worth the money!!!"
5,step 2 up and down roller coaster,This is a great toy. I bought it for my 1 year old for her birthday. She loves it and is capeable of riding it on her own. I help her on and keep my hand on her back as she rides it.My two year old also loves it. It has provided entertainment for neighborhood children up to five years old. I highly recommend it!
4,Loved by ALL,"I bought this for my 2 year old nephew. His 4, 5, and 8 year old cousins had a blast on it too. Easy to assemble, but requires a large space."
5,Lot's of fun!,"We got one for my son when he turned one, he's now 8 and my youngest uses it, he's 2 1/2....We bought this one for my nephew's first birthday...he loves it. Great fun for kids aged 1-4."
5,A Blast,"I bought this for my son for X-Mas. He is 21 months old. He Loves it! It was his favorite out of all presents, and he got alot. The car can be used off the track as a scoot and go car. Our carpet is low pile and it probably travels about 8-10 feet beyond the end of track. This is a must have! Would recommend to all."
5,Up and Down Roller Coaster is a thumbs UP!,My grandkids love it. It was easy to put together. My 2 year old is very entertained and it keeps him active. Major plus.
5,Fun:,"My little grandaughter took her first trip down it and you should have seen the look on her face, LOL. She's gonna get used to it, it will just take time, she plays on the little car and the track, but you have to coax her into riding every time."
5,Gets heavy use on weekends and teaches patience!,"We use this ""roller coaster"" in our weekend programming for 4-5 year-olds (about 300 over the weekend)at our church. We just now got our 2nd set after 3 years of heavy use during free-play time before our large-group program starts. The platform was fine, the car had taken a beating and finally kept losing it's wheels! A great investment and helps kids to be patient and wait in line for their turn."
5,Well worth the space it takes,"I bought this toy last Christmas for my 2 1/2 year old and it has been a HUGE hit. You need a big stretch of space to put it in, but we leave it out and it gets played on EVERY DAY. I also had a one year old at time of purchase, and a 6 and 7 year old. They ALL play with it, EVERY DAY. It is used for hot wheel ramps, beyblade tournaments, etc. I have found that there are a few large ticket items, like this, that last much longer and get more play than many small $20 toys. This toy is a blast."
2,Fun at first...,We have had this toy for almost a year. This was lots of fun for aboout a week. It just takes up space and I am thinking about donating it to Good will. If I had it to do over again I would never buy this item.
5,Great toy for a 2 year old.,"My 27 month old grandson really loves this toy. You do need some room to set it up and at the bottom. It is easy enough to use that he can do it almost by himself, but supervision at the top is recommended. He likes just riding the car on the floor sometimes."
3,its ok,"My daughter has fun with it but does not spend much time on it, she might go down it 4 times a day and then that's it."
5,amusement ride indoors,my daughter was 14 months old when i bought this she was scared as could be the first several times down it now that she is 19 months old i can't keep her off of it!! we have it set up in our living room so it doesn't take up to much space yet provides hours of entertainment. she makes all her stuffed animals take turns riding it down.
5,Lots of Fun!,I bought the roller coaster for my son's 2nd birthday. He and his 4 year old sister love it! They play with it every day. They even slide on it without the car. It is very durable. It will even hold an adult. I would buy this product again. Well worth the money!
5,Fantastic fun for my almost 3 year son AND 5 year old sister,"My two kids, soon to be 3 year old son and 5 year old sister are on their 4th hour of non-stop playing on this toy. He has as much fun wheeling the car back up the track as he does riding on it. We are going to get some good sleep tonight! Super easy to put together, no tools. Also easy to take apart and store. I got it at walmart tho, for $79.99. A totally worth-it purchase .. I very highly recommend."
5,Fun for all,"I bought the roller coaster for my 3 year old grandaughter. she was thrilled to death. It is not only used by her, but her 18 month old, 4 year old, and 7 year old sisters. There is a lot of sharing going on. This is super durable. It says up to age 5, but the 7 year old has no trouble using it at all. It is big, so plan on a lot of room for the car to travel. An excellent toy, and worth every penny."
5,Loads of fun for my twins!,"I got this for my twins' second birthday and it was perfect!! They can play solidly for at least half an hour, laughing and cheering eachother on all the way. This takes all of about 15 seconds to set up and they're off and rolling. Mine does not ""click"" as I read on some of the other reviews, but it doesn't bother them. It also has been great in teaching them to take turns and they help eachother position the car back up at the top. Quite safe overall. I leave it down in their playroom for a few days, then put it up for a while to keep it from getting monotonous. This was one of the best purchases I've made for them!!"
4,step 2 roller coaster,"The up and down roller coaster is cute. It is durable and easy to move around. No assembly required which was great. It could slope a little more to help momentum but still enjoyable for children. Car would be better if it had better foot platforms for child to pick up feet. Otherwise good product, nephew loves it!"
5,Step 2 for toddlers only,got it for my 1 yr old grandchild and she loves it. says weight limit is 50 lbs but that is not accurate. older 2 children are mid 40lb range and wheels start to bend with them. I would say 35-40 pounds is max
5,Great hit,"My Grandkids loved it! Very entertaining, kept them busy for hours. We even brought it indoors and it didnt take up much space."
5,Happy 2 year old,"My two year old received one of these as a present. he loves it. He rides it forwards, backwards, sidewards, kneeling (unsafe... but he does a lot of unsafe stuff...). He also uses the ramp for his trucks and cars to drive down. It workd well and is very easy to move and assemble. We bought one for our newphew also who loves it."
5,A Perfect Present!,When I was looking for a Christmas present for my 2 two year old grandchildren; I looked hard to find a gift that they would love. I found this roller coaster and what impressed me the most was that it had a perfect rating. That sold me on the product! I bought 2 of them and they have been my grandson and granddaughter's favorite toy going on 2 years now. They love it and so do all of their friends and sisters that later came along. I am now purchasing one for my new granddaughter who will be 2 soon. If you want to find a present that will make everyone happy...this is it! It is big...but breaks up easily and it is not heavy and the kids soon learn to do it themselves!
5,Two years of fun so far!!,This toy is by far the best value per dollar we've ever spent on a toy. Ours has been outdoors in our gently sloping backyard for two years running and it never gets old! HIGHLY recommend this toy. More so than any other. Durable and endless fun for all ages...15 months to 8 years!
5,Great toy for indoors or out,The roller coaster is very durable and fun. Even my 9 year has fun on it and it can withstand his weight (80lbs). You do have to have a lot of room to do it indoors but it would be great for the outdoors as well. I bought it for my 1 year old and even though he is little he still enjoys it. I saw it at a party place and saw kids of all ages having a blast on it.
4,fun and easy to move,Great toy. Parts are interchangable so you can make it shorter if you want. Super easy to put together and move around. Kids love it!
1,Just an Advertisement for the Drug Industry,"The 3rd cause of death in the United States is, no, not AIDS or heart attacks, but from pharmaceutical drugs prescribed by doctors and properly administered. Shame on the FDA.This book, The PDR Family Guide to Prescription Drugs is nothing more than an advertisement for the Drug Industry. The Physician's Desk Reference, on the other hand, is for medical doctors and contains vital information on all popular drugs prescribed today. Information from the pharmaceutical companies, how the drug should be used, how it should not be used, and most importantly, the contra-indications (""side-effects""). The side-effects of many of todays drugs are astounding and anyone considering taking them should be fully informed to make a conscious choice. The PDR (Physicians Desk Reference) for the current year is the book to buy for this vital information, not the Family Guide."
4,very funny stuff,"I saw this movie at the Wisconsin Film Festival a few years ago. I split a gut it was so smart and so stupid. STUPID! Watching the DVD I realized I missed so many jokes the first time. The helium addict was hysterical and Titler is outrageous. It's definitely a movie to watch with a group that will need a designated driver at the end of the evening. Very funny stuff. But beware, it is too long and nobody will get all the pop culture references. I watched it with a MST3000 fan who didn't know who Barney Frank or Paul Ruddnick were. He didn't like it. It's a lot more SNL than MST. I hope they make another one."
4,the next great cult classic film... you've got to see this,I saw this movie when it came to the Boston Underground film festival. I couldn't stop laughing. I am so glad that Refried flicks has finally made a DVD version. This is a really funny movie. Definitely worth seeing. I am especially fond of the songs!
2,What's the point?,I really tried to like this and it had potential but they spend too much time trying to make fun of the republicans and pushing the gay lifestyle that they screwed up what could have been a really funny show. It's worth a look but falls short of funny.
1,Lame and forced,"I can't agree with the other two reviewers. I love Science Mystery Theatre, which is very clever. This movie is irritatingly undergraduate in its humour. Avoid it and save your money."
2,"nice looking, not durable","I've had two of the flag hitch covers. If you only use them in good weather and no car washes you'll be fine. In the Northeast with the snow, salt, car washes in the winter, etc., they just don't hold up. The colored inserts will fall out of the soft metal backing, too bad because they do really look nice. And the company did replace the first one when the inserts fell out (so I guess I've really had three)."
4,Great wagon for kids and supplies.,"This wagon is fantastic. You can fit 2 - 3 kids in it, plus put food in it. There's a cool hidden compartment that you can flip up. It fits about 6 cans of soda. This wagon also comes with cup holders. We've used it at the zoo which is perfect especially if you like to bring food. We've used this to go to the park, too. It's the largest wagon available."
3,Uncomfortable Seating for Little Ones,"I read all the great reviews for this wagon. But after I put it together I realized that the seating area was so shallow. I wondered where are the sunken seats, seat belts, etc? The cooler for a 12-pack is nice but why not put a sunken seat there instead. The wagon is sturdy enough, but the seating is just flat with a short plastic rail around it. It just looked so uncomfortable for anyone to just sit on a flatbed with no real seat back. My 19-month old could bounce right out with one slight bump in the road. I think this wagon works best for bigger kids. I am returning this and purchasing the Pathfinder wagon."
5,My boys love it.,"I have two boys, 9 and 7, both disabled and they love it. They can both ride in it at the same time and still have a little room for their stuff. This wagon allows my 7 year old to go on long walks with the family and can go to the store without having to be put in a shopping cart. He loves his new freedom."
5,the best wagon by far,anyone who is looking for a wagon i must urge you to spend the extra cash and get this one. my daughter got this wagon for christmas when she was 14 months old and after we put it together she wouldnt play with any of her toys unless she could play with them in her wagon. this wagon is by far the best one on the market. it is very deep which i like because i dont have to worry about her falling out. and it is very spacious. i can fit my daughter and my 5 year old nephew side by side in the back and they still have tons of room for gear. i love the compartment underneath. it is large enough to hold my large purse and diapers. its also nice because you cant tell that it is even there. i always have a blanket in the wagon so the compartment door is covered. it is very easy to manuever and it has a nice smooth ride. so save your time and money and buy this wagon first. it is very well worth it!!!!!!
5,Great wagon,"I was looking for a wagon that would be big enough for our trips to the beach. This one is. I can fit up to 5 beach chairs, an umbrella, and a tote on the wagon. Plus, it has what we call a secret compartment, where you can store sodas & juice with ice like a cooler.I would highly recommend it."
2,A bit dissapointed,I love the room in this wagon...but the way the handle is made is dangerous. It has hit my 3 year old in the head a couple of times. It is designed to fold inwards instead of out and isn't the greatest idea.It also might just be a defective one that I received but I found it to be too tippy. Which is also dangerous.I really researched these wagons and I thought I was going to be getting the best one according to all of the reviews I have read but I am not satisfied with it at all. I am now on the working on researching some more for a new one and I decided that I would probably just be better off going to the store and personally check them out myself.
5,I love this wagon!!,"This is one of the best wagons out there. I did extensive comparing before i bought this one and i am glad i did. Everything i ever read about this wagon is true. It is SO easy to put together and take apart. My son LOVES it so much. He plays with his toys in it all the time and he loves to hide his toys in the secret storage compartment. I can't wait to fill it up with snacks and drinks when we have to go somewhere. This wagon will easily fit my 2 year plus my 2 nephews, both 2 years old. my 9 yr old also fits in this as well as me! I had to try it out too and it held me well.My son loves the cup holders too.Overall this is a great durable wagon."
5,Great wagon-hard to find in stores,"Could not find this anywhere but online. Love this product. Hours of outside play for my kids who ride in it and pull eachother and other stuff around. It's even been used as a hiding place when turned upside down. My husband and I use it a ton too for hauling firewood into the garage to lugging gardening supplies around. Great, durable product."
5,The Comfort Zone,"When I purchased this wagon it was with the idea that it would be her vehicle for walks. Although she loved the stroller, it was a bit restricting and there was not a lot of space for her ""wriggling"" and toys.This wagon has become the ""comfort zone"". It's an excellent bedside companion, ""in the living room, dining room, kitchen companion. She can be asleep and I can keep an eye on her at all times.So it has become one of my best purchases."
4,Most expensive Plastic I&#65533;ve ever bought,"I bought this after reading many good reviews by customers (last time I listen to them). It is a very attractive looking wagon, easy to put together. However I was quite disappointed by the construction. The moving parts are made of either by plastic to plastic or plastic to metal contacts. Therefore, these parts will wear out fast. It is a good wagon, not worth [the price]. (...)"
3,Way too big to be practical,"If you want the biggest wagon available, this is it! Way too big for my use though. An adult can sit in it with their legs stretched out! And I don't know how some of the other reviewers can fit it in their car trunks, there is no way I could.But I will say it rides very smooth and is easy to pull and put together...but once I put it together, I realized how big it was but it was too late to return it! I should have gotten the version with the two seat-backs that flip-down, which is more reasonably sized.The little storage bin on mine doesn't drain well and collects dirt and water. But the umbrella is awesome and totally a good idea for sunny rides."
5,Soccer Mom,"This is a great wagon! I have four children and we use this wagon constantly. We take it to all the soccer games, if you take the side off, it doubles as a bench for the kids. This wagon holds two kids all our jackets, and toys to keep the little ones busy at the soccer games."
5,Shipping costs are astronomical!,"I ended up buying this wagon from the local toy store when they had a sale on it. Amazon was the same price, but wanted $35.00 to ship it, plus sales tax. Where is the deal in that? I saved the $35 and will most likely never buy any big items from Amazon until they figure out a way to be competitive with their pricing.As for the wagon itself, my son loves it! There isn't anywhere he doesn't want to take it. With my SUV, it fits easily, and can actually be used to store stuff on the trip to the park, beach, etc. Being a little bit of a daredevil, he has already taken it down a few hils, and both survived without any injury. It also comes in handy around the yard, and doubles as a planter wagon for the garden. Being plastic, a simple quirt with the hose, and it is all clean again."
2,this cd is great!!!!,i love this cd i dont have it at my house my friend julia her mom has it and anytime i go somewhere we listen to this cd my favorite song is the sign i love that song it rocks wen i get in there car and julia wants a cd in missy her mom says wait a sec we have to listen to katie's song first i also likethe song (all that she wants) thats also a great song ok g2g:katie-lynn
2,"They are still my favorite group, but........","Ace of Base are Honestly my favorite music group, but their record company Arista, is honestly not my favorite record company. This tracklisting is just plain ridiculous. Look at it, ok, lets start with the fact that ""Always Have, Always Will"" which never released in the US as a single is on it, but where is ""Never gonna say I'm sorry"", ""Living in Danger"", and ""Whenever you're near me""? Three tracks that got bigger that ""Always Have, Always will"" were not on here. And what is up with only putting on of the new songs on here? Where is ""Hallo Hallo"" and ""Love in December"" that were both used on the European version of this album? Well, heres to hoping Ace of Base learned a lesson and will ditch Arista."
2,Not all of their Greatest Hits are included.,Living in Danger is nowhere to be found. : ( <very sad> I should have looked closer before I bought it
2,not bad,"Wow this cd brings back memories from back in the day but now that I remember, there is only one or two songs I liked"
4,"Good but incomplete, get ""Singles Of the 90's"" instead","Check ebay.com if you don't wanna pay $40 (I got mine for $9.99 sealed), I would suggest skipping the US version of AOB's GH and get the European version instead. You get 6 more tracks, including 2 never before released songs, as well as the original mixes of Cruel Summer and Lucky Love (both superior to the US mixes). It also seemed like it was done with a more labor of love than the Arista GH.Every track on this sans the remixes at the end are on the Euro version"
3,Good Beat,"It is an overall good cd. Like all cd's it gets old after hearing it alot. I get tired of it playing at work all the time but one in a while helps me keep my Lunch Meat slicin rhythm, lol."
3,Good but not great,"It would have been better if Arista had included more new songs. If you don't have any of Ace of Base's albums I would reccomend this, but if you already own all their album's this isn't worth it."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I loved the first few songs, but other than that, I think Abba did a better job with this bouncy kind of music."
2,MANY HITS ARE MISSING!,"Where are Living in Danger, Never Gonna say I'm Sorry, Wheel of Fortune, Happy Nation??? Why didn't Arista release Singles of the 90's??? SOT 90's is a way better CD than this. The only reason I gave this CD 2 stars is that AoB is my fave group. Please note: THIS CD IS A TOTAL DISSAPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Arista screws with us again.,"Well, once again, we American AoB fans are screwed over by the record company that is Arista. After dismal promotion of their previous release ""Cruel Summer,"" we get a Greatest Hits package that pales in comparison to the import versions. Instead of the many new songs, we only get 2 - the wonderful ""C'est La Vie (Always 21),"" and ""Life is a Flower,"" which was remade into the wretched ""Whenever You're Near Me"" for the Cruel Summer album. On top of the lack of new songs, we receive two very uninspired and not very special remixes of ""Lucky Love"" and ""Beautiful Life"".The one shining point of the album, however, is the stellar dance remix of ""Everytime it Rains"". Now, I'm a HUGE fan of the original ballad version, and this remix doesn't compare to that, but on its own it's simply wonderful. However, I doubt that the album would be worth buying on that alone."
5,Flashbacks,"Yessss..they are back! this album is a must have for all acers and dance music fans, they put all there feeling in one cd,you will love this,it will take you back to those precious moments..."
3,"Not the song best choices, in my opinion","I guess this would be a good introduction to Ace of Base. However, The best songs are on The Sign and The Bridge. There are only two good tracks on Cruel Summer; the title track (which is a cover) and Tokyo Girl. I'd buy The Bridge and The Sign, and download the two good tracks from Cruel Summer. Their forth CD is total garbage. Trying to make more money or fill out a contract, and it shows."
4,reasonable tribut e,most of my favourites were included here. More live tracks would have been appreciated and a few covers wouldnt have gone astray...gh2?
4,"Would be perfect, if....","Ace of base is history right now, but one that is worth recollecting.This best of was released only in the States and Canada (Europe got another version, better one).I give only 4 stars, 'cause there are things that are missing here. Just to mention two: ""Happy nation"" and ""Living in a danger"".They also add ""Lucky love"" in acoustic version, which I find worse than the original one.I decided to buy this one, because of the extra mixes and the fact, that some songs have other arrangements than their european versions (vide ""Everytime it rains"").Overall, I recommend this cd to all fans of the 90's and people who like nice and happy euro-pop."
4,Good record,"They have been around for a while and all their songs have been fun to listen to. Well now you can get this awesome cd and have all of their great songs on one cd. Its great party music and the singer has a real great voice. I especially like the song ""all that she wants,"" because it has a really good beat to it and it sounds really cool. Another one of my favorites is "" The sign,"" because again its got a beat that you could dance forever to. Buy the cd, you wont regret it."
2,What? The best there is?,"No! It's just a bad compilation! I mean, this CD contains only 12 songs, including 2 awful remixes that weren't even made by Ace of Base. Also, it contains only one new song. A lot of great hits are nowhere to be found. ""Never gonna say I'm sorry"" is Ace of Base's best song, and bingo, it's missing. Don't get this CD, buy the Euro-version, called Singles of the 90s. American Ace of Base fans got screwed with this CD."
1,Bad Company,"This company sucks, there is no one to answer the phones anymore. I have a unit I installed 4 years ago and now I am having issues with the unit and cannot reach a real person for warrenty. The phone goes on for about 30 min then tells you the mailbox is full and to try your call again. Just another company that outsourced and ruined their customer service. Don't waste your time, pay a little more and buy an real unit from a real company and save the heartache."
1,no go,"very excited to get an alarm at a good deal with free shipping but that all changed when i tried installing two beeps and then nothing i have spent over an hour of tring to get this to work and i tried new fuses but ""no go"" to sum it up the two orginal beeps is all i got from this product besides stress. NO GO!"
3,"Nice, but lacking","Wynne Jones is a fabulous author and her daring takes her in all directions in her writing. This work is good, but gives the feeling it's not one thing or t'other. It would make an excellent first two or three chapters for a novel, or, if rewritten, an excellent short story. As is, with 116 pages, it is either too much, leading nowhere, or not enough. Personally, since I can't get enough of her work, I would vote for a novel ;)."
5,Great album,"Best cd I've bought all year. It's great to hear all those classic Sambora licks when he was so young. Great mix, excellent songs. I highly reccomend it."
2,questionable durability,"The product was shipped quickly and intact. I bought the crutch tips on behalf of my uncle who frequently uses crutches. It appears that the 1st & current pair of new crutch tips he is using are wearing out rather quickly. Now to be fair, my uncle-the user of the tips, is not exactly a lightweight thus a possible?? cause of the premature wear on the crutch tips. I really can't say but we are a lil disappointed as a more sturdy tip was hoped for."
3,Pedestrian swing,"Yes, Bill Coleman was a brilliant swing trumpeter;in the league with Roy Eldridge, Harry Edison, Buck Clayton, Cootie Williams and the rest of them, a bit neglected in the USA because he spent most of his time in France and travelling around the world. He played with the best American and other musicians (in the US and elswhere), including Ben Webster, Billie Holiday, Lester Young and Django Reinhardt;check out for instanceDjango and His American Friends, Vol. 1 & 2.But, this late live outing with French musicians finds him a bit weak on his horn and, even more so, in his voice, the solos are mostly a bit pedestrian and, to add the insult to injury, the last number doesn't even finish normally, it fades out as if it were a pop number.Not the best place to start to know your Bill Coleman."
4,Shiva Rea Music,"I really like this CD because it has drumming music. If you are a teacher, I would use this during a power yoga class. The music is beautiful and interesting to listen to."
2,disappointed,our family is very disappointed with this LCD tv. the contrast on all of our other sets is clearly better. this Sharp LCD's picture is very washed-out. terrible.
4,a well-written dossier of African-American life circa 1950,"'Going to Meet the Man' is a diverse collection of short stories which attempt to explain the psyche of young black American boys/men in the early 1950s. Yes, there is anger and frustration. But the author's excellent prose elevate the stories beyond stereotype. He is compassionate without making these characters into martyrs of white America.Of course many will argue these stories are badly dated. And true, America has moved on (generally for the better) since the early 1950s. But it would be unfortunate to overlook these stories for this reason. Baldwin captures the essence of where American society has come from, and we can all learn from history. I also feel it is unfortunate that nearly all the readers of ""Going to Meet The Man' will be African-Americans, unlike myself (..who have the most to learn).Bottom line: terrific tidbits showing Baldwin's brilliance. A worthy read."
3,Good book,But I had to read it for school so it felt like a chore to read it althoug I did find it a bit interesting at times.
4,"Extremely funny, yet infromative","The author did a great job in making this book as funny as possible while still sticking to the core of the book, the rise and fall of Solomon Brothers. (I REALLY fell of the chair laughing a couple of times). Details of various accounts that occuered during the authors employeement at solomon add to the excitment and provide valuable lessons to apply to the real world. This book is a classic and should be in every ""wall street addict's"" library"
5,One of the top financial books of all time,"Michael should never have wasted his time - and sullied his reputation - by writing his paean to Jim Clark, the elder statesman of the 'dot bomb' generation (""The Next Next Thing"") By doing so, he missed out on the real story of the age. But hey, no one's perfect. ""Liar's Poker"" about the Wall Street of the 1980s and is one of THE finest books about the realities of that perenially shaddy business. Anyone who read it, and took its message to heart, would have seen the 'dot bomb' coming from a mile away. Too bad publishers weren't buying THAT story. Lewis is a thoroughly entertaining writer. ""Rising Through the Wreckage on Wall Street"" is a newly minted subtitle of which I thoroughly disapprove. There has been no 'rising' since 1980. It's been fraud piled upon fraud as Michael knows better than most. I worked on ""The Street"" in the 1980s and his account is 100% accurate - which should have scared the heck out of any investor with a brain."
5,A Modern Day Classic,"Sell your soul and buy this book with the change! I read this book -several times- a good few years back and having just picked up a new copy and finished it in one go, it is still a classic read after all these years. Lewis's behind the scenes peek at Wall Street's 'Greed is Good' mentality of Salomon's bond dealers in the 1980's is a book that gets a hook in you from the very start. People still talk about Liar's Poker after a decade, it's that good. Read it and believe it."
3,Entertaining for awhile; falls off near the end...,"Liar's Poker is a funny look at life on Wall Street; especially the life of lower-level employees getting their start in the financial world. Michael Lewis uses the personal experience of his financial career in the Salomon Brothers bond program to tell the larger story of the rise and fall of the entire firm during the 1980s. Along the way he tells some funny stories and gives the reader an interesting, inside look at the fast-paced life on Wall Street. But in the end, the book starts to drag and Lewis's cynical view of the securities industry begins to get tiresome. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what a trader's life is like inside a major Wall Street firm. It is an interesting, initially humorous read that is appropriately not much longer than 200 pages in length."
2,In 20 years Lewis would learn to write well.,"I bought this book because I'd read Lewis' ""The Big Short: Inside the Domesday machine"" and was impressed by the author. But ""Liar's Poker"" is juvenile by comparison. It's not about what happened in the financial markets but rather about classroom hi-jinks and trading floor pranks. Who cares? I got 40% into the book and gave up."
3,Decent book.,"The book was decent, but I thought that the writing style was a bit dry. I wish I could have paid 1/4 the price for the first 1/4 of the book, as I was really drawn in by the first few chapters. However, it seemed that the latter portions of the book didn't have much ""new"" material (they seemed to read more like a memoir than an introduction into the financial world). All in all, a good book, but I wouldn't consider it at the top of my list."
5,Great service,The book is in very good condition. The shipping is very prompt. Great reading if you would like to know how the mortgage market was taking off in the 1980s.
4,What is the worst that could happen?,"So my take away is that the financial industry was populated with a mixture of vial semi-sociopaths who compete on the field of ""not on my watch"" to lure and pressure suckers into a game that even few in the industry understand.But since it was written way back i 1989, I am sure that they have cleaned up their act before anything really bad could happen . . . right?"
3,A warm-up for The Big Short,"This book is entertaining, but not particularly interesting and never exciting, since how could bond-trading be? Had Michael Lewis not been the author I probably would not have read it."
4,"Must read, Highly entertaining","Liar's Poker is one interesting view of the Wall Street firms and their culture in the mid 80s. The author definitely made a bold decision at the time to publish the book and use the real names. A lot of people perceive the work of Wall Street bankers as something complex and complicated and yet Mr. Lewis admits that ""Much of my working life [I spent] inventing logical lies... Most of the time when markets move, no one has any idea why. A man who can tell a good story can make a good living as a broker. It was the job of people like me to make up reasons, to spin a plausible yarn."" The book is easy to read and is highly entertaining."
5,Have you read Candide? Read Liar's Poker,"Liar's Poker reminded me of Voltaire's Candide and gave me comparable laughs. When a trader tells the young trainee Lewis that he is lower than ""whale shit on the ocean floor"", he recoils to a corner at the trading room ""feeling the warmth of the whale shit"". This is one of the funniest books I've read. Cynical, with the perfect timing of comedy, full of insights into the machinery of greed, it portrays Wall Street as the ship of fools. And at the last chapter, if you read between the lines, you will agree that he, too, concludes that the best choice is still to care for you own garden...Read it and enjoy! Believe me, I never lie."
3,Interesting but not exceptional,It provides a good picture of the Wall Street during the 80's but it is sometimes tiring when describing the personality of some characters.
5,"Well written, outstanding read...","I read Michael Lewis's ""The Big Short"" before I read ""Liar's Poker"". Both of these books gave me a huge amount of insite into Wall Street and bonds.I recommend these books to anyone that is politically active and really wants a complete understanding of the 2007 debacle and what caused it!! Believe me, you will not be disappointed!! Better than fiction!!"
3,"fun, quick read on the roaring 80s, but not too deep (and it wasn't)","If you even wondered what people do and what knd of people there are in those big buildings on Wall Street, this is your book. You see, from an insider's ironic detachment, how clueless these people were, how little they understood what they were doing with the incredible amounts of money seeking to make more money. Not only do they care little about what they are doing for their shareholders, but they make bad mistakes that ruins lives. The excesses - like huge buckets of guacamole for snacks or unbelievable arrogance - are sickening after a while.Lewis writes extremely well, truly a unique voice. While I felt a bit disappointed pnce I finished the book as I gained little understanding of the protagonists' motivation and reflcetions (assuming they had any), the descriptions of what it was like are very interesting.Recommended."
4,"Intreresting, but not as funny as advertised","My son (18) read this and was on the floor, laughing. He recommended it as an hilarious read, and--having heard about it--I read it. It was truly interesting and informative, especially about the initial construction of the mortgage-backed securities that are tanking today, but I guess I was used to the shenanigans and excesses of the moneyed Wall Street types. I laughed once, at an image of trying to buy $400 of Mexican food (in the mid-80's). The book is well worth reading, but I would not buy it for the laughs."
2,"Not too bad, although gets boring at times","Not a bad book about bond trading back in 1980s at Solomon. Couple of funny places that made me laugh. However, in general, it'd probably only be really interesting for those who are into bonds."
4,Leaves something to be desired,First half = interesting. Second half = kinda boring. Lewis has inspired me to write a better insider's account of Wall Street.
4,Superior Trading Floor Expose,"Liar's Poker is to the 80s what Frank Partnoy's F.I.A.S.C.O is to the 90s, with the notable exceptions that Liar's Poker is well written, it's funny and its author obviously understood what was going on. Where Partnoy (unwittingly) portrays himself as an impressionable geek, Lewis by deliberately painting himself that way is a disarming and likeable narrator.If skulduggery on the trading floor is your bag, then this is the book for you - give Partnoy's feeble impression the swerve."
4,"fun, exciting and educational","after reading various books on finance/investing/money, i found it highly refreshing to read a story-based book... one that encapsulates the joys and spoils of being a bond trader during the days of michael milken, salomon brothers and the likes.gaining an inside perspective of how the market functions and who the money movers are is truly educational... being blind to the stories in this book is like trying to sail in the ocean without a mast!although i found the book to be gauged in the days when bonds were hot and exciting, the overall reading experience was great.from bonds, to mortgages, to interest rates, to the federal reserve, to bust... worth your time. enjoy..."
4,"Well-written, entertaining and eye-opening","Liar's Poker is a very well-written book. It is fun to read and hard to put down at times. The author does a great job of showing the realities, and the absurdities, of the wall street culture he finds himself in.The only downside is how much effort he spends to position himself as an outsider - at times, it felt somewhat fake and over the top. Nevertheless, this is definitely one of Lewis' best works."
4,A good business read,"One of the most biting ""insider"" critiques of 1980s Wall Street personalities and practices. Fairly readable, Liar's Poker blends humor and critique in an entertaining way. The book was written well enough to entice me to read Lewis' later compilation of essays on similar topics, The Money Culture."
5,"funny, sharp, and gives an inside look at I banking","Look into the 80's and investment banking, what goes on inside Solomon Bros. and developments of the time."
4,More fun than serious,"Anybody looking for a sober review of the financial markets in the 1980's and/or Salomon Brothers' role in it will be disappointed. However, as a review of one man's experience on Wall Street, it is suoerb. Michael Lewis is a wonderful storyteller, and he writes this book so that you don't need a deep knowledge of finance to enjoy it."
5,Read This Now That The Market Collapsed,"This is an incredibly poignant book now that the market has collapsed and many of Michael's ""characters"" have come to justice or some other demise. The story is well written and, for me, an incredible job considering that I'm not a financial person. Once I picked it up, I could hardly put it down; and, that is saying a lot for a book on finance and Wall Street. Now that we find ourselves in the midst of the desolation created by a handful of incompetent, but clever, swindlers, this book clearly shows the reader how this happened. It is entertaining and scary at the same time. Lewis' writing is captivating and I plan to read his other works. Highly recommended."
4,Wow,Michael Lewis does a tremendous job in this book to show the rough and tough world of what was a highly sought career on Wall Street
3,Liars poker,Great book. Good beach reading for a business student. Good read after reading the big short. Lewis does a good job making the material accessible.
4,Ignore Uninformed reviews,"This book has received several one-star reviews from persons who apparently either believe it concerns poker card strategies or think that they have hit upon a clever way to promote someone else's books. They are wrong on both accounts. This is an important document from the last financial slump of the late '80s and early '90s describing how stock brokers are given incentives to dump losing stocks on small clients as a way to prop up the returns for their employers' own in-house accounts. Hence, the ability to claim that X bank has been able to achieve a phenomenal return on its own investments--just think what X bank can do for you! Well, thanks to this book, now we know: X bank can unload all of its junk on you and laugh maniacally as your account evaporates. Timely reading for the current financial scandals."
4,"Had to get book for class, but would recommend for anyone",Great book to have insight on CMOs and other collateralized debt obligations. You do not need a finance background to enjoy or understand this book.
3,"Terrific stories, but needed more","The stories of Wall St excesses are well told and most readers will find very captivating. ""True Greed"" is a very fitting byline. Useful also for understanding financial markets. I thought the book got way too technical though, and tried to become a history of the bond markets in the 80's. I wanted to know more about the traders themselves, what did they do with the enormous sums of money they made, what was life outside the office like? We are not told anything about how long the working day is, what their friends thought of them, where they lived etc."
2,Sophomorish Writing,"I didn't finish much of this book. The subject matter is very interesting, but the writing seemed like a high school term paper."
3,its actually from the 80's,"Most remarkable thing is the same stuff we battle now, apparantly also happened in the 80's.Markets needs to be regulated, not least bond and stock markets"
4,A little dated but still a good read,"I picked this up based on the enjoyment I got out of reading ""Moneyball"". Michael Lewis is a very good author, whose prose flows nicely, whose characterizations are memorable, and whose sense of humor is keen. This is the story of Lewis' job working for Salomon Brothers in the 1980's. If you are interested in Wall Street history or even getting a better understanding of the issues involved in the stock market problems in the late 1980's Lewis makes the topic fun and accessible. My biggest problems with the book were that is you wanted the history lesson, you could find a much more concise resource, and if you wanted a great story, you could find better ones, not constrained by the bounds of an author's experience. All in all, this is a decent read but pales in comparison to ""Moneyball"" and, I have heard, ""The Big Short""."
3,Insider Information,This book is more of a brief history of Salomon Brothers from 1985-1987. There are some good first-hand accounts from the author and he has obviously done his homework interviewing other employees and attempting to discern the relationships between the various players.A good read if you have an interest in Salomon Brothers and financial intrigue.
3,Read for a basic understanding of share trading,"Liar's Poker's explanations of Share Trading terminology (ie. shorting and junk bonds), was helpful to the novice stock broker, as myself.The plot was lacking, although the story of Salomon and the volatile financial markets kept my interest."
2,Liars Poker: There are 23496 characters in this book?,"Knowing the reputation Michael Lewis has, I had high hopes about his first book and how enlighting it could be. However, after hitting the midway point all I wanted was for it to end (never leave a book unfinished).Honestly, I struggle to find what all the hub bub was about with this book. His writing style is very drab and he introduces way to many characters in the book to the point you begin to just gloss over names as you realize no one matters, as there is no point to any of his stories.I cant describe other feelings as this book has left no impression on me what so ever and a better read if your looking for a bit of history and insight upon the inner workings of Wall Street tycoons is ""When Genuis Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long Term Capital Management"" by Roger Lowenstein."
5,Still great many years later,"Being a sports fanatic, I started into Michael Lewis' work with Moneyball, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The crossover to the realm of investment banking has been just as entertaining. Even though Liar's poker was first published when I was young child, I found it very insightful and educational. The flow of the book was consistent and kept my attention span of a young adult. I could not put this book down. A great read for the young and old."
4,Lot's of fun and hard to put down.,"I picked this up off of a bookshelf at a cabin I was staying in for a week and had trouble putting it down. The section on the mortgage traders is worth the price of the book alone. ""They committed acts of gluttony, the likes of which had never been seen on Wall Street before."" Lewis' vivid descriptions of these guys had me rolling. Near the end he gets a bit cynical, but it doesn't take away from the rest of the story."
4,Liars and their wake...,"This book was a nice prelude to the 2008 disaster. It is unbelievable the complete disconnect between the financial institutions and their sense of responsibility to their clients.One of the clients they toyed with had 82 million invested with them. Exactly how much money to you need to have before someone on Wall Street actually values your patronage?!It was and still is a public sector without values and run on ego and competitive lust. Millions have suffered directly from these peoples' actions...people have loss their retirement, homes, jobs, everything. And some have even died early because of the stress. And why? So a few dozen self congratulating fools can buy $20 martinis confident in the knowledge that they will never come face to face with the people they hurt so grievously. I hope there is such a thing as Karma."
2,Complete exaggeration of life on Wall Street,"If you want to believe all the myths you've heard about Wall Street, read this book. If you want to really learn about what sales and trades is like on the Street, read a more factual book, like ""FIASCO."" I felt that Lewis did a lot of embellishing so he could sell more books."
2,"Highly overrated, sensationalist.","This book is tremendously overrated. Lewis' writing style, while amusing, is also quite amateurish. Plus he seems to have a major superiority complex - is he really the only honest guy on Wall Street? Puh-leease."
2,"Outdated, boring","This book is terribly overhyped. Overall, it's a pitifully dry memoir of a man who never made it big on the street.I would recommend Rolfe & Troob's _Monkey_Business_ over this book."
1,This book was pure drivel.,"I read the comments of both the customers and critics and was excited when the book arived at my home. Then, after reading the book, I re-read the comments to see to see if they were perhaps talking about the same book I read. This was pure drivel. Read the back cover on the book...then multiply that drivel by 250 pages."
1,Waste of time,"Probably, I misunderstood that I would learn something from this book about finance or markets in general and would be able to use these ideas to add to the bottom line - make more MONEY. But it seemed like my goal behind reading this (or any other) book was too clearly defined and this book did not help at all. If you have too much time, nothing to do, and are looking for something to pass time then read this. But if you want to achieve something such as gaining insight into trading, selecting, analyzing stocks or securities etc then do not waste your time. This book has no direction, no substance, and not much to learn from it which can be used to produce results."
