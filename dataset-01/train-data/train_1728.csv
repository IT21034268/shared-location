4,"Tender and uplifting, but aimed at much younger children","This little book is short and simple. The main problem is that it is clearly aimed at children who may not even be old enough to read it for themselves. Not that there's anything wrong with a grown-up reading to them, but encopresis affects many children that are over the first-grade reading level. (The little boy in the book appears to be approximately first or second grade.)Unfortunately, there is very little out there in the way of useful, informative literature that addresses the medical and psychological aspects of these problems. Dr. Galvin is to be commended and congratulated for his efforts and insights on how to comfort, encourage, and challenge children (and parents) who deal with encopresis. Believe it or not, with patience and perseverance, this problem does end, and there is life after it."
3,Already out of date...,"See David Page's (at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass.) new research, first hitting the news on June 18, 2003."
4,Love is Blue,"Perhaps because I am from Minnesota I appreciate Alice's sense of honesty and justice. Perhaps because I am the keeper of several cats I enjoy this feline series. But for whatever reason I loved this entry from the ever-busy Lydia Adamson.A Cat with the Blues gives the reader a good mystery with many twists and turns. In addition we see Alice in love, silly schoolgirl love. It is a fresh addition to the world wise former actress who has seen it all and has a plan to handle anything.The old song 'Blue on blue, heart ache on head ache' would provide good background music to read this story of a Russian Blue caught in a messy divorce. I recommend this book to old fans or readers new to the series."
1,Because they won't let me givt a ZERO!,"I bought this camera (my third camcorder), because of the name. As I found out the name isn't every thing. I had it 2 weeks, and in that time I had to call JVC (their online service never returned my e-mail) twice. The first time I could fix it myself waiting 45 min. The seconc time (after having this camera only 2 weeks)I was told to take it in for repairs, so I sent it back. Save your time buy something else."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,JVC continues to turn out products that are defective and they do not stand behind them. I bought my daughter a camcorder for her graduation and she is unable to use it because the camera displays an E03 lockdown mode message which disables the camera. Apparently the only way to fix this problem is to bring it to a dealer and pay for the repair. I also understand that it can be a reoccuring problem. There is a class action suit pending. Spend your hard earned money on a better product.
4,A QB for History,"Calling all LSU, SF 49er, and NY Giants fans. This book is a fun read, and leaves one with the feeling of having intimately known one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever wear a football uniform. As opposed to many sports books, the author's vantage point allows her to tell the story of this football icon with refreshing sensitivity. The author, through her lively descriptions, tells the story of how from his humble beginnings in East Texas, Y.A. Tittle rose to become the toast of New York, and a member of the NFL Hall of Fame.Y.A. Tittle's unique athletic abilities, and sense of humor are framed by the parables of Greek mythology. This unique treatment is appropriate, because the author provides an inside view of growing up with a legend."
3,Not their Best but still good,"Although this certainly isn't their best album, I'll take Paddy to Bruce Springsteen any day of the week."
1,A total disappoinment,"I'm a big fan of Prefab Sprout. Absolutely love Two Wheels Good (their best)and Jordon and Swoon. But this album has no soul, no depth, and no genuine emotion--which is so uncharacteristic for this otherwise wonderful band. Trust me, skip this CD."
2,Paddy's big mouth,"This record is just weak, whiney brit pop. Let's see Paddy make a record as ambitious and glorious as ""the Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle"" or make it onto the cover's of Newsweek AND Time the same week. Ever heard McAloon called ""the future of rock n' roll? Never will, big mouth!"
1,THE VIDEO SUCKS,THE VIDEO WAS MORE THAN A DISAPPOINTMENT. TO SAY IT WAS POORLY DONE AND SUPER CORNNY WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY............
3,When you can't get anything else,"The headphones are of decent quality and should really only be used when you haven't the ability to find anything more suitable. These are sufficient if you break a pair of better headphones and need something to temporarily replace them, But I don't recommend taking these with your Discman to school as it easily could not stand up to rigors I put it through at one day of school. But, If you need a pair of headphones so you can just listen to music in the most primative sense possible, pick these up. They are not great, but you get what you can :)"
5,"Cheap, and good. Worth the cash.","I just bought this pair of earphones to use with my Creative Nomad II player. It gives very clear sound, compared to my old Sony earphones...Though the bass can't compare to my headphones. :)Value for money...:)"
3,Informative and Boring,I bought this book in my childbirthing class since it was recommended by the instructor. Despite the title it mainly focuses on the labor part but it is VERY informative about all your options including what medications are available and how to go natural and it really tries to get your partner involved. However it's surprisingly boring considering the subject matter. There are much better books out there that are not only informative but easy to read too.
2,This is like every other pregnancy book.,"This book isn't any different from many other pregnancy books that are out there. If you know nothing about pregancy and childbirth this book would be a good starting point, but it tries to cover too much info in too short a book. There is almost nothing about pregnancy itself. I would recommend one like ""Your Pregnancy Week-by-Week"" instead."
3,Will make you paranoid,"This book doesn't offer anything more than articles on[...] or any other book on pregnancy. Maybe it does... it offers a lot of information on possible complications before, during, and after labor that I started getting stressed out. Reading about the many things that can go wrong with the pregnany isn't exactly what I want to dwell on during this time in my life that I should be feeling very blessed and happy. I had stopped reading it for my well-being."
2,Very thorough but too dry and politically correct,"This book is very comprehensive and contains a lot of useful charts and checklists, but it makes for a fairly dry read. It also is written in a very politically correct tone so you're left feeling like there's only one right way to have your baby, the authors' way. I can't recommend this book to other moms."
5,"The most comprehensive, honest book you can find",This book is hands-down the book of all books when it comes to anything prenatal and postnatal. Just buy it. You'll thank me later.
4,Thorough but Dry,"The hospital where I plan to deliver gives this book out free to its patients, which says a lot. This book is very, very thorough. It barely skips a thing.However, it's very dry and clinical - like a textbook. I found it very taxing to read; it just did not hold my interest. It's organized like a textbook, meaning the chapter transitions are a bit jarring for a newly pregnant woman who perhaps is looking for a more timeline-based presentation. The photoillustrations are dark and look like snapshots rather than professional photography, which means they're often useless.I went back and forth over giving this book three or four stars and finally decided on four with the caveat that it is best used a pure reference. For an equally info-packed pregnancy book that is more enjoyable to read, I recommend Ann Douglas' ""The Mother of All Pregnancy Books."""
3,Better than What to expect...,This book was okay. It wasn't as detailed as I would have expected but it was more real life application. The What to Expect book was overloaded with all kinds of information that made it hard to focus on the subject at hand instead of everything that could or might happen.
5,Very Helpful,This book tells you everything you need to know about childbirth and what to expect and hospital issues.. everything! it doesn't go week by week its kinda all together info. but really nice.
5,Thoughtful and intelligent book,"I wish I had read this book sooner. I was given several books on pregnancy and childbirth by friends and relatives. My husband and I call ""What to Expect"" the ""Panic"" book. Most of the others are comforting but lack detail. In contrast, this book is very thoughtful - it offers multiple alternatives for specific situations and it tells you WHY you would decide one way or the other. Sometimes it recommends a course of action and other times it lays out the alternatives and their pros and cons. But it always treats the reader as an intelligent and thoughtful person. I expected most pregnancy books to be written that way, but unfortunately, this is the only one I have found that arms the reader with the ""why"" behind each option."
5,The book to educate and empower.,"We all dream of the perfect birth. For me it included no epidural, quick birth, and no tearing. This, however, was not the case. Eventhough things didn't go as planned I was prepared for everything that happened and the experience, none the less, was wonderful. This book, which was recommended by my doula, gave me many insights into what was going on with my body and baby during my pregnancy, delivery and post partom. My mother in-law told me I knew too much going in to my delivery (referring to the knowledge I gained from all my reading). But I firmly believe there is empowerment through education. I think it is much better knowing than to go in not knowing like they did years ago. We are of a generation of educated and empowered women. This book will assist you in taking control of your birth and pregnancy. I recommend reading as much as possible, it's good to get different perspectives but if you were to read only one book this would be the one!"
4,"the art of closing any deal, how to be a master closer",exactly what you need if you consider your self weak in closing like I did. I was selling timeshare and now I'm selling real estate and insurance and I learned a lot from the book and I recommend it to anyone who needs to harden up and sell!
5,Great book !!!,Mr. Pickens did an awesome Job again with this book. Everyone in the sales field should read this book. Really learn a lot of helpfull tips. This is my second book and I will buy more books from the same author.
1,Art of Closing Any Deal,"If you want a good laugh, read this book! At least 3/4 of this book is filled with nonsense. It's not clear, concise, and to the point."
3,Not Bad,"The strong points of this book are that it gives you tons of advice on how to deal with various types of people and situations. Written years ago it is definitely NOT Politcally Correct as it has sections on how to deal with Jewish and African American customers etc. At least my old yellowed copy I found does. not sure if that has been edited out since.The story that supposedly happens for the author to learn the selling skills has to be the cheesiest thing I have ever read. Complete with a Mr. Miagi-like character who cries while he gives his ""most serious selling lesson ever."" It culminates in him literally disappearing, leaving the author to ponder the wisdom of this old man. Absolutely ridiculous. My whole office loves it actually as it is relentless at times, no holds barred and over the top cheesy. Kinda like a bad Jerry Bruckheimer movie."
3,Good but lacking in integrity,"I have learned a lot from this book, however, Pickens encourages people to play fast and loose with the truth. He sees no problem in out and out lying to prospects, ""opponents."" Are professional sales people fighting a war with prospects or are we trying to form partnerships which should be long term? He also has a section on ""pressure, tricks, and traps."" Was he a CIA agent in a former life? To me, integrity is everything in selling based on values and ethics, not tricks and traps. We are not hunting Viet Cong.He does have some brilliant insights in closing, when used honestly. Also he has insights on different types of buyers in different professions and ethnic groups. Buy the book, but toss out the bones."
2,"It's sales, not WWIII","I found a handful of items helpful, but for the most part, this book is trash. Not much integrity on Mr. Pickens part. If I have to be deceitful or worse,lie to get a sale, it's not worth it. I believe when you close a sale...you actually open a relationship. What kind of relationship would you have if it's not built on trust. ""Going in for the kill"", ""opponents"", ""trap questions"", ""pressures"", ""tricks"", ""psychological manipulation"". This wartime approach doesn't work in 2001 unless your selling trinkets from the back of your van."
2,A lackluster read,"I purchased this book because I thought it was about closing business deals, it isn't; this book was written for salesmen. The language of this book isn't very engaging and due to it's redundancy I found myself loosing interest very quickly. There are many chapters with many key points that are supposed to help you with sales but I find this to be too much information to be effective. For example there's a section entitled 35 tactics, another with the 20 greatest closes, and multiple sections with 5-10 tricks of the trade. You won't be able to memorize all of this information and some of it is just anecdotal and not very useful. One of his 35 tactics is no one is poor; he goes on to say that you should always treat your customer as if he has money. Although I agree with that principle it's really not a tactic. If this book was half as long and written better I would rate it much higher."
2,The Art of Manipulation,"This book is a cleverly repackaged version of ""The Closers"" written many years ago by Ben Gay III. While there is some powerful sales technique in this book the book centers itself around manipulating a prospect into the buying decision and encourages the use of hi-pressure. A salesman may gain some great insights into sales but must guard against losing some of their ethical balance in the process."
1,It's a slap in the face to the selling profession!,"When I first really got into this book, I had to look to see if it was classified as a comedy. This book will be helpful to you only if you enjoy lying. Any book that describes your customer as your ""opponent"" should be thrown in the trash. I'm glad that I checked it out from the library instead of wasting my hard-earned cash. Yes, there was a little valuable information in this book, but I could have gleaned it from any GOOD sales training book."
3,Loved It Before Nothings Shocking.......,"FIrst came across JA on a comp called ""Scream"" or something of that nature. Went out and bought this record and thought it was pretty fantastic to say the least and at the time it was. It sounded signifigantly different than anything else at the time and Farrell had one of those voices (like Robert Plant) that would forever mark the band. Then something happened--""Nothings Shocking"" was released. SO my point it this after honing their skills and and releasing two classic records this sounds rather novice by comparsion and in actuality it is. The covers (Stones, Velvet Underground)are throw aways (read as: set fillers) however there are hints of the greatness to come, Pigs In Zen, My Time and Trip Away, I only wish they had reworked ""My Time"" on ""Nothings Shocking""."
5,This is one of the best live albums I have heard.,"A real class act, after hearing this album I will be standing in line to get tickets to see them. From start to finish, the band plays so well together I can't get enough."
3,Little Princess,"After reading the other reviews, I bought the 7-9 size (my daughter is barely a 7) for a princess party she was attending. It DID fit her torso, but the length was 2 FEET TOO LONG (she is perfectly portional)! I did not want to spend as much getting it hemmed as I spent on the garment, so I bought hem tape, but I was not sure it would work and I had little time. I ended up using double-sided tape. It is a good price, but I wish they would make drawstring skirts to make it more accessible to all body types."
3,Good Camcorder - Could have gotten bang more for my buck!,"Don't get me wrong, this is a good camcorder. I love all of the functions and it's really easy to get started with and use. The built-in light and stability features are too die for. There are tons of accessories you can get to enhance your pictures and vhs quality. But, it's not a true digital camera. And the digital camera function could be improved on. I get better quality photos using my scanner at home. The software that comes with the system is not adequate either. I feel that the $649 retail price I paid for this camcorder is WAY too much.However, all-in-all the camcorder is excellent. But I do recommend you buy a back-up battery or stay close to an outlet because the battery barely makes the full 2 hours it claims it has. We thought we'd be able to shoot basketball games, but it barely makes through the first half on 1 batterty. If you can get a good deal on it go ahead and get it!"
2,Paper thin characters made for a TV movie,"What a disappointment. After reading the reviews above I expected so much more. The characters are poorly developed and the dialogue is strained at best. I give this book two stars because of historical research and the battle scenes are well done. Perhaps the author should try nonfiction. For an outstanding insight into the ""psyche"" of the pre-civil slave; try William Styrons incomprable ""The Confessions of Nat Turner."" Give Jacob's Ladder a miss and wait for Blair Underwood in the TV version instead."
2,Don't mention this in the same breath as Killer Angels.,"Meticulously researched, yes. But other than one female character who ends up serving as a nurse on the Confederate side, the characters are truly flat. Unlike in Shaara's Killer Angels, where the characters are almost unbearably compelling--who, for instance, is not touched by the portrayal of Joshua Chamberlain?--the effect of this book is very chilly. Even the battle scenes are more scholarly--lots of period detail--than engaging. I had high hopes, but was very disappointed with this book."
4,The Civil War in Microcosm,"This novel captures the civil war by concentrating on one extended family of Virginia slaveholders and its black ""servants"". The ante-bellum scenes show the mixture of kindness and cruelty that permeated the master/slave relationship. In the war section of the book (unlike Shaara's The Killer Angels, generals are absent and the battle scenes are written primarilly from the enlisted man's point of view. The confusion and madness of small unit engagements are depicted with a remarkable reality. My only complaint is that the framing story of a WPA interviewer does not ring true."
2,Myths & Stereotypes,"I thought Mr. McCaig's writing was good and the book kept my interest. But I was disappointed that he perpetuates the myth of evil Southerners. His original title for the book was ""The Worst Cause"" and the book is written with that slant. From reading the book you would think that 96% of all Southerners owned slaves rather than the 6% which actually did."
5,Jacob's Ladder delivers,"So many interesting layers of people, now and then. So many situations and incidents that show the brutal toll the Civil War took upon our nation and it's people. At the same time, it's humanity is so heart rendering and believable. .A WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL read!"
4,great characters!,I loved this book. Filled with descriptions of life during the Civil War from everyones differing points of view. I loved following the lifes of each rich character from before during and after the war.
4,Jacobs Ladder,"This book was purchased because of a book club and it was the book of the month. I found it not as interesting as past books, but if you are a Civil War ""buff"" you will like it."
4,Makes you feel like you're there,"This was a wonderful story, well researched and elequently written. I've never been a big fan of Civil War novels, but this one has definitely swayed my opinion of them. The numerous plots within the story made for wonderful reading. I was sad to part ways with Sallie, Jesse, Duncan, and who could ever forget Marguerite..."
2,Style of writing tedious....,"I usually get into a book within the first 50 pages, but this book hasn't grabbed me yet and I have waded through 100 pages. The style of writing has me frustrated, and I keep putting it down and reading other things. I have gone back to it three times and it is slow going. I have been a civil war buff for years, and enjoy the John Jakes historical novels. Can't say I would recommend this volume, maybe I'm not literary enough?"
1,UNREAL,"This novel was a great disappointment. It is realistic enough about material conditions of life in the Old south and during the Civil War but it is not realistic in its portrayal of characters and social relationships. Major plot events turn on ""issues"" which were never issues at the time, such as legitimacy or illegitimacy of slave children. I did not find the characters very believable, especially the slave trader, who was just too noble to be true, and the slaves themselves, who seem to accept everything massa does with a forgiving shrug. For a good portrayal of the experiences of blacks in the Union army, or of the attitudes of slaves to their unkind masters, a reader will do much better to look at Fragments of the Ark. Jacob's Ladder is slush."
3,Jacob's Ladder,"This is the panoramic, sweeping sort of historical novel. It has literary qualities, and parts are excellent. But the author tries to do too much.Had McCaig confined himself to his soldiers, perhaps emphasizing the comparison and contrast between his desperate Confederates and his well-fed but disrespected USCT, the book would have had more focus and impact. He writes battle scenes very well. But he gets sidetracked into endless subplots, most of which I found boring and long-winded. The ""framing"" device of the girl collecting interviews seems particularly irrelevant, but the domestic scenes, in general, drag.McCaig does well at writing from both white and African-American viewpoints without stereotyping or dehumanizing either group; his characters remain individual human beings.I found only small and fairly irrelevant errors here, though McCaig takes some minor liberties with the Battle of Fredericksburg."
2,doesn't fit,The mags do not fit or stay in my son's airsoft gun. The top part where the bb's come out of the mag is taller than the mag that came with the gun therefore it will not stay locked in.
1,I'm Confused...,Will this mag work for a Well M4 A1 Airsoft Electric Rifle AEG? I really need someone to comment because I don't want to order the wrong thing and I might need to get a mag very soon. The mag that came with my gun is a hi-cap mag that holds 350 rounds. Would this mag be pretty much the same thing because mine looks the same according to the picture(which as I've heard isn't accurate)?Thanks for any comments you send!!! ^_^
1,Same thing,"The same thing happened with me. The magazine is nothing like the picture and I thought it would work my M83 because they look exactly the same, intil I got my R6, but it doesn't. I saw an add on Amazon that is selling an R6 with an M83 mag so I thought the R6 and M83 mags were the same. But I don't know intil I get my R6. I haven't used it yet but it's not weighted and works like a regular hi-cap magazine."
2,For classical guitar solo its a so-so violin duet,"Here are some Christmas Carols. Someone is playing beautifully harmonic rills and sensitive chords on a resonant guitar. Someone else is scratching out the melodies on a $10 violin. (A musician I know said ""You can still hear the cat on that one."")The choice of songs is fine. For the money, what do you want? Still, it is not a ""Guitar Christmas"" and it's not beautiful because of the voilin playing. This one will be a white elephant at the party next year for sure."
1,Does not work,The barometer needle was set on the side of the dial (instead of the center) and did not appear to be connected to anything. Thermometer consistently showed temperature 5 degrees lower than my other two thermometers. Returning the product.
2,"Cheaply built, hard to calibrate","My Chaney Instrument Oak Finished Weather Station has a chip on the side of the backboard that the manufacturers should have caught. The barometer works and is accurate, but you have to tap on it to get a good reading. Also, the barometer can be calibrated (with great difficulty) but not the tempurature gauge, which eventually became so inaccurate that I threw it out. The humidity gauge is very difficult to calibrate and I'm not sure it's even possible to do so, since I just gave up on it. Appearance-wise, the set is okay. But if you're looking for something which actually works well, look at something else. I used the barometer and humidity gauges in another set, discarded the board and temperature gauge. If you're interested in getting accurate readings, get a digital set instead. I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this unit at all unless you want a cheap barometer. I'm only giving it two stars because the barometer works... at least for now."
5,Comparable To Expensive Weather Stations,"This is a nice item, especially for the price. It's not cheap looking and the basic style should fit in with almost any decor. I have it inside the house on an 'outside' wall.I've had the item for a few months (from summer heat and humidity to winter's below freezing temperatures), and I've found it to be accurate. The humidity and temperature reading matches with our other electronic weather gauge, and I've found that the barometric reading consistently matches the ""Weather Channel"". My one complaint/ suggestion is there are no feet on the backside of this item to keep it slightly away from the wall, so as to allow for better air circulation. This was easily remedied by going to a local Home Depot and purchasing stick-on ""feet"" for $1 (1/2 "" diameter x 1/4"" high).I've been unexpectedily pleased with this product and would recommend it without hesitation."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This item does not work. After carefully calibrating each dial as instructed, they do not work. Very disappointed. Embarrassed since I gave this as a gift. Cheap merchandise."
1,Does not work!!!,"This item was smaller that I thought, and it does not work. It was a christmas gift and I cannot find the receipt or I would have returned it. Also, the recipient of this threw away the packaging because the ""instruction"" said to let it ""sit"" for a few days to get acclimated. Well, it never did!!"
3,Not quite as pictured,"This is a decent weather station. The color pictured looks like a natural wood, but the actual product is more of a painted orange color. The price is accurate for this product."
3,Pictures can be deceiving,Not as good a quality as expected. Seems cheaply made. Works but next time I'd look for something more substancal. Guess some things you just need to see in person.
1,Horrible,Inexpensive for a reason. As decoration it's nice. The brand name on the thermometer should be ACU-WRONG not ACU-RITE.
5,Hey it's just what it says,"See the picture over there? That's what was shipped to me. It has all the things the description says it does. The things on it do the things it's supposed to do. Even with the Japanese spirit Azukiarai living in it, the thing still works fine."
4,Does it work?,"This is an attractive enough piece and it does ""seem"" to work...that is, the humidity read in my office by my old reader says ""50%"" and this one, in the living room about 30' away says ""30%""...but then, maybe I'm all wet. The dials are a bit small, but all in all, if you really need to know what the barometric pressure and the humidity readings are, you might as well settle for whatever this set up claims them to be. Why not? It's not as if we're sailing anywhere."
1,Chaney Instrument Oak Finished Weather Station,"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK, non of the 3 stations worked at all. Was unable to adjust any of them. DON'T buy this crap."
1,cheap crap,"The simple temp gauge doesn't work at all, just stays on one temperature.The barometer keeps going off the scale, pegging out. I adjust it to the right pressure and it keeps going off the scale.I can't adjust the hydrometer, it fluctuates around 50% when the actual is around 25%.I knew by the price that it wouldn't be high quality but I thought as long as the gauges work I don't care.BURNED, it truly is a total piece of crap, don't waste your money."
3,Acurite/Chaney Oak Finished Weater Station 01523,"This item was bought from Deerso through the Amazon web site.This seller should be commended for its quick and well package shipment.Now onto the product itself.The quality control for this product is in great need of improvement.The wooden plaque had some cosmetic flaws, not eye sores but visible. The make believe brass trim around each 2.5 inch plastic bezel is also made of plastic and each of these had visible scratches In fact other than the wood plaque everything else is made of plastic including the instruments. I did find the instruments to function and each have the ability to be adjusted if needed. Please note that the barometer has a tendency to stick and needs to be tapped lightly the key word here is lightly before a reading is to be noted. Once this is done I found the readings to match my local airport pressure readings.Recommended accessories.Magnify reading glasses and a pocket flashlight to read the numeral instruments."
1,Chinese Junk!,"This is a complete piece of junk. The item arrived with the thermometer at 100 degrees and it never moved. While the instructions state that the temperature is adjustable via a little screw in the back, and this is indeed true, it is only adjustable to the temperature for which the device wants to read, not what it actually is. Don't take the cheap way out with this piece of junk. The seller was excellent and credited me right away."
1,broken out of the box,This product was a piece of junk. Two of the three dials didn't work. I guess you get what you pay for. Returned it and got a refund.
1,Cheap plastic junk,"Only part that works is the temperature gauge.The barometer is very cheap, doesn't follow pressure changes accurately. Only moving about half as far as it should. The hand that you set to track changes is not tight, flops around if you touch the barometer.Humidity gauge is also not very accurate but within 10% so not as bad as the barometer.I like the wood holder, so I swapped out the barometer with a desktop one I had that fit in the hole, I wanted a barometer to hang on the wall so this will do."
2,Defective,"I recently received this item and the temperature dial didn't work, I'm not sure about the others. The product came alone in this giant box with very little packing so I'm not sure if the dial was damaged during shipment or if it was broken before hand. Either way I'm getting a refund and will be ordering something different."
2,Barometer didn't work,"I bought this item in May of 2007, but left it in its box, because I didn't have room for it in my house at the time. I have now moved and brought it out the other day, and discovered after several days, the barometer doesn't work.Unfortunately, it's too late to return this - so buyer beware!"
3,iz it working??,i bought this based on the many positive reviews.i'm not sure it is working. . .the dialshave not moved in the last week...looks the same again...the dials still have not moved.it has been six months. i think itz broken.thanks for shipping junk !!same in the winter as the summer.it looks good though !!
2,"Looks nice, works poorly","I've had this weather station for about five years now. I was especially interested in a device with a hygrometer. Unfortunately, that gauge on this product never worked. More recently, the thermometer has stopped working reliably. That leaves me with one of three more or less reliable working gauges: the barometer."
1,Not as advertised,I ordered oak and received a cherry one. The hygrometer did not work correctly. I returned it and Amazon gave me back my money and even paid the return shipping. You can't beat that. I would not recommend this product.
1,Do not waste your money.,"This is a very personal book -- and at one time it would have begun to fill a small niche in the military history of World War Two -- not there weren't plenty of books available on the invasion of Poland, but there were for a time very few in English. Now, however, this gap has begun to be filled, and admirably, by qualified historians such as Richard Watt. This book adds nothing to the mix."
3,Caution needed for contact information,"Surprised to find a swatch of Barclay hunting tartan used on the back cover, I quickly flipped to the Barclay section. I was pleased to again find Barclay hunting used, rather than the normal yellow Barclay tartan. The write up of the historical information was accurate UNTIL I got to the end which stated that the current chief lives in Essex. Sure enough, when I checked the address listing, our current secretary in Richmond Virginia's address is correct, BUT, the other address is Colchester in Essex. This has not been our chief's address for over 10 years. I wonder how the author picked one current address and not the other.

5,"Easy to use,","I have used this camcorder now for at least 3 years and it's a wonderful camera. I have used it everywhere, including weddings, birthday parties and during vacations. Since this camcorder is VHS formate, I like it how my recordings can easily be played in any VCR with just an optional VHS playback adaptor. It has neat features, like digital wipes and fades that can be used at any point to make a transition between scenes. It even reduces unwanted jitters from recordings made while walking or in a car. I also like it because it's very easy to use; and it has great digital zoom."
3,Palm Size Compact VHSs Camcorder with LCD,I really don't have a review. My JV camcorder is 16 years old and does not have the quality anymore. I only realized this after taking pictures at my parents 54th wedding anniversary and wished the pictures would have been better. I am in the process of shopping for another camcorder.
1,Nastyboy Chit,This jus looks horrible from the cover i mean look how corny they look......they should be wack cracka klick
1,Kodak's photo papers don't work well with my Epson 1280,"I've tried both Kodak's photo business cards and its photo paper with my new Epson 1280. The printer in general produces spectacular results on Epson's photo papers. Kodak's photo biz cards gave me dull, unsaturated colors with a tendency towards brownish or magenta rendering - very unattractive. Kodak's photo paper produced nice results in light areas, and bizarre blotchy results in dark areas of the image. I actually changed color cartridges, thinking one of the colors had gone dry, but got the same results - until I switched to Epson's photo paper. I've also had unsatisfactory results using Kodak's bizcard photo paper in my old Epson 850."
2,Cheap Headphones Cheap Quality,"I needed a pair of headphones since my last headphones had a short in them after almost a year of use. Well, I purchased these strictly out of economics reasons. I didn't believe I was getting the greatest headphones, but neither did I think I would have a short in them within the first 4 hours. This is exactly what happened. I took the headphones out of the box at school to use them. Before class I put them in my bookbag. After class, I am having to tilt my head one direction to receive any sound at all and the feed will only come in the right ear. What a peice of garbage, couldnt even last a half a day. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
2,TOO BIG FOR MY HEAD,"This review is for Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS port for increased bass response. Sound is fine for cassette audiobooks, which is what i bought them for. But i don't use them because even when adjusted short as possible, the earphones fall about half-way down my ears, which makes them pretty uncomfortable. Also, loose. I am 5'7"" adult female with average head size."
4,Great for the price!,These headphones are light and comfortable. The sound is clear with descent bass tones. Clearly these were not intended to replace studio headphones. I use them as an alternative to ear buds because they are more comfortable and have a little better sound.
5,5 Stars,All I can say is... wow! I didn't really expect much from these but the sound is AWESOMEThe bass is really what it says and more! it's powerful and accurate yet it doesn't overpower or sound too deepand the unique design fits comfortable in the shape of the ear rather then just sit on your earThese are the most powerful and by far the best headphones I have ever owned.
2,Tiny sound,"I bought this headphone because of the positive reviews, but when I tried it, I got tiny sound especially the bass response. It could be the unit was defective, but I am not taking another chance. I am going to spend money on something better."
4,Worth $20,"I bought these for $5, but i would sell them for $25+, They are light, long cord, pretty good sound quality, can definitely feel the bass."
4,"Good for the price, but...","Nowhere does the description say that you MUST wear these over the head. My old headset, which looks very similar, could be worn from the back of the head/neck. This means that when I go out walking or anywhere else where I want to wear a hat, I cannot use this headset.As for the ""increased bass"" -- I did an A-B comparison with my old headset and they sounded very similar in quality overall. If the RP-HT21 has more bass, my impression is that they simply attenuated the high frequencies (making the bass more predominant), as the maximum overall volume from the RP-HT21 is not as high as with my old headset. This means that in a noisy environment, you may not be able to be able to hear it.Bottom line: for indoor use (no hats) in not overly noisy environments, this is a good headset, especially for the price."
2,Short in cord somewhere,"The headphones are comfortable, and when they work, they sound wonderful. I got two sets of these for my kids to wear while using their ipods, and they immediately complained about the sound issues.If you hold your tongue just right and don't move very much, you can wiggle the plug to the point where the sound is equal on both sides of speakers and sounds great. One false move, and a fuzzy scratchy sound begins and the sound cuts out between each of the two speakers.I took a chance with the cheap price, and I got what I paid for."
5,Great headset for the money,"This small headset has bass reflex that no earbuds can match. Anyone that uses a MP3 player, or DVD player will be more than pleased with the sound quality"
4,Bargain!,"Excellent sound for this price. Not the best, but I got it for $4. including shipping. This is really what Chinese headphones should sell for anyway, but don't. Remember, even at this price they're still making profits or they wouldn't sell them."
5,Awesome Sound! Great Price!,"These headphones are the best sounding headphines I've ever used. So far they've seemed very durable. If you are on the fence about buying it buy it! If you are worried about them breaking because they are cheap, buy several - they're cheap enough. Again very high quality for a low price"
5,Panasonic RP-HT21,Pros:1 light weight.2 Good quality.3 Low price.Cons: noneOther thoughts: All Panasonic stuff I have just works.
5,Superior sound at a great price,"I don't use anything fancy for headphones at the gym and these headphones fit well, sound great and are cost effective. Panasonic puts out quite a product these days."
4,Noticeable Bass,"At an affordable price, its good to hear the base sound and clarity. Adjustable and indeed lightweight. I would recommend this product."
3,"Adequate Headphones, Get What You Pay For","I purchased 2 of these for my two children, 5 and 6, for some small netbooks I have that they like to use to play games or for a portable DVD player when we travel in the car. They like the fit and feel of the headsets on their smaller heads vs. the plug style headphones. One of the two has broken already after about 90 days. The issue appears to be that the plug is a right angle plug which, when pulled out from the netbook or DVD player, it creates stress on the plug and it shorted out the connection.I ordered a replacement because the kids like them. The kids like them and the price is right. I have tried to get them to be more careful with the plugs, but I don't think it is their hands pulling on them as much as the design. They are adequate and serve a good purpose for us."
2,"Good, but didn't last long","Good headphones, good sound, but after about 1 month of use, one earphone crackles in and out and has stopped working. I haven't been particularly rough on them and treat them carefully, could just be a defective pair."
3,Worth the low price but not a dime more.,Good for speech or other non music uses. Plastc headband not very comfortable for extended use. Low price makes this headset disposable and worth buying. Probably good for kids uses.
2,OK item,I think voice quality is great but cord length is very short and its hard to use in office. But overall price-wise it was very cheap hence not a bad item.
4,headphones,The panasonic rp-ht21 can not be beat for the price.Sound is very good.Would highly reccomend.Gary 58 years old.
4,onvenience and better comfort,"These basic (and cheap) headphones are much more convenient, i.e. don't constantly fall out, and comfortable than the in-ear phones that come with the ipod. The sound may not be quite as good, but they produce a pretty good sound."
4,"Good sound, low volume","You do get a stronger bass than expected from such a small headset. However, in order to actually hear the difference, you need to either turn up the volume a lot or press the ear-cuffs to your ears."
3,"sound is good, but earhpone is irrational","sound is fine well, but the earhoone have nipped my hair and pulled it down twice ! my GOD! i would not use it ever!"
1,Bad Headphones,"I bought two pairs of these headphones based on some of the reviews and I can't tell you how disappointed I am with this purchase. I've been using the Sennheiser RX 100 headphones for the past few years and some of the reviewers compared the RP-HT21 to the RX 100. The RP-HT21 are not even close to the RX 100 and for starters, they are very uncomfortable and slip off your ears easily and have very low volume. Overall, just a bit better than the headphones at the dollar store with a better bass."
1,might not be worth it,These headphones don't work with Ipod or Iphone. They work fine on the exercise machines in the gym that have individual TV monitors.
1,Dissapointed,I purchase three sets of headphones and have only opened one to date. One side does not seam to have sound for some reason?
3,Shipping,"I am very unhappy ..I just received my headphones and the thing I'm disappointed with is shipping.AFTER i had placed my order for a $4.80 pair of headphones, I ended up being billed $26.48 for shipping to Alaska when the package only says that they paid $5.44 for shipping. I relooked over their website and it says that they only ship within the US. WELL, ALASKA IS WITHIN THE US!!!!!!!!!! And then I see where they have this chart, that I MUSTVE OVERLOOKED BEFORE, that there is a specific charge for shipping to a PO Box in Alaska. What's wrong with this picture? The company address is from Franklin Park, Illinois. Guess it mustve cost $21.04 for someone to use a big truck to go to the post office. *VERY UNHAPPY*I haven't even taken the headphones out of the package yet. Sure hope they've got gold plating. *UGH*"
4,good price for this lightweight headphone,Good price for this headphone. Seems fragile. XBS port is new to me. Sony should explain it in the description what this port do to enhance this headphone. Of course one could google XBS port.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"For $5.00 I wasn't expecting much and that is just what I gotThese headphones are:1. Sound quality is poor; the volume is very low2. Not compatible with my HTC One S (Android)3. Very, very cheaply made4. Not comfortable at allCheap is dear.Spend your money on quality items and don't waste your time with these."
1,Bad pair?,The most recent pair of these was too loose of a fit and a wire has apparently broken in the cord. They didn't even last three months.
1,Good Product for the One-eared,"The headphone worked okay for a couple of months, then one side stopped working. Bought two of these in the past year, this issue happened with both."
4,Great For Price,"These headphones work well for the price , they are comfortable and sound is reasonably good , they cannot be compared to an expensive pair of headphones , keep in mind they are 5 bucks with shipping. Personally I dont need them for music I use them with a metal detector so bass doesn't matter but if you want great bass these are not for you"
5,decent buy,"Sound quality is ok, especially for the low price. The highs are not much better than the ipod earbuds, bass is about the same as ipod's too but overall I prefer them over the ipod's even if they are over the head. They fit comfortably, and i can wear glasses when using them which is a plus (no ear pinching). The price is the only reason to buy these- i would never stuff my nicer headphones in my backpack or go biking or snowboarding with them, which is what i use these for. They aren't very sensitive (you gotta turn the volume up a lot to get them loud) but they have been durable for some time now."
5,Great sound,"I have several brands of headphones including the excellent denon ah-1001,$130.but for every day use on all your radios,computers and other devices for about $5.00.the panasonic rp-ht21 headphones are an excellent choice with excellent sound.You cant go wrong when ordering these from amizon,I have several of these and will probably order more in the future."
4,Perfect!,"This is exactly what I needed, and at a great price! The sound quality is good and are comfortable on my head. Huge deal!"
2,"Great headphones for the price, while they last...","I bought my first set of these in June, 2010 for $4.27. Great price for the sound quality. Ten months later, for no discernible reason, the left earpiece went out.OK, I figured, they were only $4.27 - besides, perhaps I did something to cause it (unlikely, because I'm gentle with my electronics).So, I bought another pair in April of 2011 for $4.80 (tax this time, doncha know). This pair lasted six months before it became necessary to wiggle the plug to get the left headphone to work.If you don't mind replacing these every 6-10 months (that's my experience, anyway), these are a great budget pair of headphones: they sound good, and are comfortable. I'd prefer to pay double, or even triple, the price and have a set that would last for at least a couple of years.Why must so many products be designed this way?! It's bad for the environment, and it's inconvenient for me."
5,Great,"Comfortable, easy to wear and light-weight. Sometimes when I plug it in my cellphone the quality of sound is not so good (sometimes the sound is gone if you are moving), but general use on computer is fine."
3,It's not that comfortable,I think it is just fine but not that comfortable. It seems doesn't fit my head and always cannot hear clearly.
5,Best headphones i've seen under 5 bucks,"These head phones are great and only under $5 each (with amazon at only $4.95). They are pretty durable also, the only reason i had to buy another pair was because i stepped on them by mistake at night. They aren't the highest quality headphones ever but they are great for the price i give them 5 stars."
2,More like a toy,"The sound leaks like crazy. I originally bought these thinking the slim profile can help me listen to my iPod while lying down in bed. They are useful if you like the whole world to know what your listening to, and they are a step up from cheap United Airlines headphones that you get on long distance flights."
4,decent headphones,These headphone are great for the money I spent on them. It is a little frustrating though because I searched for collapsible headphones. These do not collapse in any way. I should have read the specifications better. At least they provide good sound quality.
4,"Inexpensive, Comforatble, Good performance","These are not high-end, these are not high-tech, and these are not high-performance.As a low-priced, act-as-you-expect headset for an iPod or or other audio device, you cannot go wrong.Given the inexpensive price tag, if it wasn't a Panasonic product I'd have arched an eyebrow in anticipation of low quality.I'd have been wrong on any account. These work as desired and expected. Recommended."
3,"Cheap Price, Doesn't Last","I never leave reviews, but I am so enraged by this product, I have to leave a review. I have gone through two of these headphones, in the last few months. I was drawn in by the cheap price and the purported heavy bass. However, the product doesn't last. One side, always, goes dead, within a short while. I hate having to listen to audio just one side. So yes, as a short time, run of the mill, headphone they are okay, just be prepared for them not to last."
1,Sloooow Shipping,"I bought a couple of these headphones so that the kids could each have their own pair while we were vacationing. When I placed the order, I had over 2 weeks before we left, so I used the Free Shipping option. Three days before we were to leave, Amazon had not even shipped the headphones even though they were in stock, and refused to cancel the order, with some lame excuse about their shipping methods.The headphones were delivered when we were halfway through vacation.I know this is a shakedown from Amazon to induce me to switch to their ""Prime"" membership which I will never do on principle. Since then, I have not bought a single item that is sold by Amazon, using their marketplace instead, and have had no shipping issues.The headphones work well enough for what they are worth, but if you want them delivered on time, do not buy them from Amazon."
1,Piece of junk,The plug doesn't stay in. Audio cuts out whenever the cord is bumped. Do NOT buy! Total Waste of money.
1,Delivered with only l ear phone working -- please pick up & send replacement!,"We recently ordered this headset. It came very quickly and so for that we were delighted. However, the first person to use it discovered it had only one earphonethat worked, and by then we had thrown away the packing.Will you send another and pick up the one we have? We have the cardboard backing.Thanks."
1,"Two Big ""Ears"" Down","Headphones you might find at The Dollar Store! They are cheap because they are cheaply made. Too big for any of the 5 of us in my family and the ear pieces are too small to fit over an average adult's ear. Don't be misled by these other positive reviews, I would be surprised if you were happy with these headphones."
1,A worthless set of earphones,"There's not much one can say about earphones that don't deliver a good (much less, a great) sound. I'd say: save your money and buy something a bit more expensive to plug INTO your ears. This is a waste of money.Disappointed in L.A."
2,Are you out of your mind?,I'm Sorry if it is just me but life is too bad to be wasting 1 thousand dollars on a pair of headphones and you can buy headphones for 10 dollars or less at marshalls!! i mean look at them no style no personality they just look like basic headphones you'd get with a cd player! You have to be a damn fool to buy these!
3,Jack doesn't fit with certain iPhone cases.,"I have the speck pixel skin for my iPhone 4. I have to take it off before plugging this headphone in because I guess the jack is too big and the pixel skin only allows for thin jacks which is annoying I guess. I have plenty of other headphones/earbuds and only this pair of headphones seemed to have this issue. In terms of sound, don't get your hopes up in blocking environment noise but the sound quality itself is good."
3,Cheap product cheap price!,I needed something for the gym.. something cheap since most of my headphones in the past are in the trash b/c of the wiring...... 6 bucks... the shipping was almost more than the price... They feel good on my head... that's about it for the positives.... The sound quality is like those headphones you get for free on a flight..... The crispness of the sound quality was not important.. but I wish the had a little more volume....
3,Ok - not great,"For $4, it's hard to beat. I find them uncomfortable after half an hour or so, though. The band cuts into the side of my head and sometimes they can start to slide down. The sound quality is fine - nothing outstanding obviously, but that's not what you were expecting was it?"
4,Alaska teacher,"I bought a dozen of these for my tutoring group, so each student could have their own. MUCH better than the ear buds for little ears. Sound quality okay - price great. We've been using them a month now and they seem to be holding up fine for daily use."
3,OK for the price,"I guess you can't criticize sound quality too much on headphones that retail for $5. For the record, though, these RP-HT21s are slightly below par compared to the similar headphones that came with my 2003 Panasonic SL-SX420 MP3 CD player, sounding a bit less strong and detailed. Also, the foam padding flaked off quicker, and I find the earbuds to be angled inward a few degrees too far, falling short of a perfect fit.So yes, there is some degree of variance in basic headphones, even of the same size and brand. Undemanding ears should find them perfectly fine, though, and if they fit you better than me, it's easy to call them a good deal."
2,Don't buy these.........,"ACK!!!!! I should have listened to the others!! The plug doesn't connect worth a darn, you have to wiggle it ALL the time. Thought I'd get a good deal, failed. I'm going to give these to my little boy to play with and buy something that works!!"
2,the earpiece broke off from the headpiece,bought this for my young son and he broke it immediately. yes he is young but i think the head gear should have a little flexibility to it. the head gear has no give and i would not recommend if you want it for children or if you want to travel with it.
3,Okay,These headphone were okay. The volume doesn't get very high but it has a some boom and bump to it I guess.
3,headphones,Very good product very good investment for my prodject. Im very happy i found and bought this item. Good item for my project makes me proud to have found this
3,Rather tight,"Sound seems ok, but the plastic loop is for a child's head, I think. They push on my ears pretty hard."
4,Great product--for the price,"The good: These headphones are pretty good. The sound quality is not bad at all, and they are comfortable to wear (at least on my head, which is probably near average) for extended periods of time. I was previously using a pair of super-lightweight (not a technical term) headphones from a Sony jogging radio. These are slightly quieter or more muffled, but I don't really have a huge preference either way.The bad: They feel pretty cheap, and can pinch your hair if you move them around too much. Also, not that it really matters, but someone might be concerned, the black writing on the earpieces wore off almost immediately (I could rub it off with my fingers). Permanent marker rubs off that silver plastic as well."
3,Good value for cheap headphones,"They sound decent, with adequate bass and overall good sound. They don't cup my ears properly or tightly enough, but sound ok despite that. Definitely worth the money, or up to $20."
5,Great Headphones,"I bought a total of three Panasonic RPHT21, Lt Wgt with XBS PortHeadphones. As much as the first set has been excellent, our cat chewedup the connecting cord, ...so now we have two more (one in reserve, if the cat decides to munch on it again.)For the money value - this model Headset is the best.Thanks Amazon for an excellent service, also."
3,Cheap but sturdy,"I needed some headphones in the car for the kids for their various devices so I bought a couple of pairs of these to keep in the car. So far, they've survived the various mishaps of two young, rough boys using them, and they don't look the worse for wear (unlike other headphones we've had). They are inexpensive though with middling sound quality, and the sound does ""leak"" out, so I can hear a muffled version of what they are hearing. I'd buy them again though."
4,Does what it needs to,Great price for the budget heaphone. My little kids use it to listen to their iPods. No issues as of yet and seems to work just fine.
5,Silent Night,"I bought these for my 9-year-old granddaughter, to accompany a Coby CD player, for Christmas. She put them to good use right away and all in the room were happy."
4,Old Fashioned Is Good,"Since the inception of ear buds, I have been without anything to directly hook into my music. I REALLLY DISLIKE ear buds. These headphones have good sound quality, great lightweight, and enough cord length. So happy with old fashioned headphones!"
3,Not too bad,Quite good. I didn't expect very much since the product is not expensive. But it is worth for the price. Kids use this for computer. Still holding after about 2 months. Light weight for adult.
1,Quit working after a few weeks,These seemed OK at first but then they stopped working on one side after a few weeks. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Poor hearing...,"Not sure what other ppl who wrote a review for these headphones heard. I put them on and listened to Jango on my Toshiba Thrive. Sounded like I had cotton in my ears. Bass is good no mids at all but the highs sound like they are being clipped. Like listening to sound through a fan. I plugged in my older cheapo buds and the sound was 10 times better. I bought the Panasonic headphones mainly to Skype. Haven't tried that yet. Will update. But hey, what do you want for five bucks."
3,"You get what you pay for - a good thing, for the right price.","I paid $5 for these. As $5 headphones, well, these are actually pretty damn good. These things can't compete with better quality headphones, such as my old Sony MDR-V150s (which are no longer available at reasonable prices, sadly), but they sound alright, and are comfortable.If you are looking for a cheap pair of headphones that don't go in your ear and you won't feel bad about when you or your kid inevitably breaks them, this is a good buy. If you are looking for audiophile headphones, why are you looking at $5 headphones???"
5,Big melon head like mine? Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS Port,"These are great for the money, and will not be too small for your humongous head. There are enough good reviews here that I agree with. No volume control on the cord, but not a big deal. I was surprised by the bass performance also. Should of bought more."
5,High Quality Cheap headphones,"The subject says it all. Headphones are light, nice and fit well on my head. I have no complaints."
4,Sufficient. Value for the cost.,These work well. For the amount I paid for them ($5) I would definitely recommend them.
4,"They fit properly, they play sound, they work as expected.","The headphones fit nicely, and work. When wearing them you can still hear sounds from around you. Conversely, you can hear sound from the speakers when they are not directly on your ears. The sound quality was okay: it wasn't poor, but I don't think it was fantastic. I am not an audiophile, though, so I can't comment on exactly how good it is. I didn't use the XBS."
3,Okay,"I purchased these headphones first a foremost because of the cheap price, but also I was in need of some headphones for when I'm listening to my ipod while I'm working out. Earphones never stay in my ears when I'm moving a lot, so I thought these would be perfect. Shipping was very fast, and I was very happy with that. I've used them a couple times and the sound quality certainly isn't the best, and it has some static sometimes, but what more can you expect for only $5? If you just want something cheap that you'll use on occasion, these are perfect, but if the quality matters to you a lot, I'd say don't get these. Overall, I'm happy with the product."
5,I think they are great!,"I bought three of these in case of breakage. So far I'm still on the first set after about five months. In my opinion they work very well and so for the money I would say they can't be beat. I had a hard time finding the length of cord in the specs so I will state here that the cord length is about 4 1/2 feet from plug to ear pieces making for comfortable sitting approximately 3 1/2 feet from the source. If you need more length then buy an extension. The plug itself is a small standard one prong stereo plug, that fits in my Sylvania TV for example. So for the price, these headphones are unbeatable. What a feat Panasonic, thanks."
2,You Must Be Kidding Me...,"I bought these headphones for use with my iPod. While I do spend up to 20x the price of these for home usage, I don't like spending too much on phones for my iPod as they get beat up easily. I figured five bucks, good reviews, worth a shot.These headphones sound bad. I do know these are quite cheap, but I've still heard better even for this price. The problem is the sound is plain tinny. Even with some equalization in the mix, I couldn't get ""good bass"" or a full sound out of these. Also the midranges, specifically the upper mids are screechy and overproduced. Another issue is the volume. I have to crank up about 70% of my recievers volume for moderate volume, and the iPod is even worse. Yes, they are cheap and comfy, but they sound as good as they cost. I've found that both the Sony Walkman headphones (MDRA110) and the Coby CVH42 for the same price sound better."
2,"Poor bass, low sensitivity","I bought this not to save money, but based on the positive reviews.I don't think it is a great product.USE: running on treadmill (so far)(therefore some higher background noise)PRO:- low price- build quality adequateCON:- two cords (which I didn't initially see in photo) - cumbersome when running- low sensitivity- bass not impressiveSPECS:Driver: 30 mmFR: 16 - 22k Hz (usually not useful in evaluating headphones)Sensitivity: 100 dB/mWImpedance: 24 ohmPower handling capacity: 1000 mW (*IEC)Cord: 1.3mMass: 65g (2.3oz) (without cord)"
4,Great for the price!,"Great for the price. Ordered them on the 20th and got them in four days! Great fast service. I will definitely keep my eye on these in the future, incase I need more headphones as I go through headphones ALOT. Bang for your buck! Great value!"
3,Not too bad,"My Iphone earbuds broke, and I prefer big earphones anyway. For $5, you could do worse. Both ears work, but if you move, there is that annoying static, so I won't be using these at the gym. Nonetheless, they are pretty comfortable. I have a feeling they'll be broken or 1/2 broken within a year, and then I'll probably drop another $5 for a new set."
5,"Great quality, no problems","Great cheap headphones! They are cheap, but they don't sound tinny at all. They are wonderful for people who don't like ear buds or just people who want a set of decent headphones for a low price. Nice quality and last forever. There are no cons to these at all. You can't get anything better for the price."
5,"Cheap, but very Good!","I bought a couple pairs of the Panasonic RP-HT21 headphones from Amazon about a year ago, and I am still very happy with them. I use them daily with my iPad to listen to music and watch videos. They have amazing bass response for such an inexpensive headphone, and sound much better than my stock Apple earbuds; they're also quite comfortable.Even though I own the Bose QuietComfort headphones, I find myself using these almost all of the time due to their small size and good-enough sound. One pair also survived a chewing by my puppy and still works great. They get 5 stars because they're the best value I've found. I'm going to buy a few more to use with my computer at work."
1,Disappointed,"The sound is bad, I am very disappointed with the quality of the product, very lower sound. I tried in some devices and sound lower in all."
5,Great Product...,"Great product for the affordable price. I was impressed with the sound quality. The bass, midrange is awesome. I like this headphone for the price and I will buy more next time I shop at amazon. I will recommended this to my friends."
5,Great headphones,"I bought these to use on my computer at work and they do the job splendidly. They're lightweight and very comfortable. You'd think with such a low price, they'd be el cheapo but they're really not. Before I bought these, I had bought a much more expensive set of headphones to use on my computer at work and their performance is really just about the same."
2,ok for the price,"You get exactly what you pay for. Tried to listen to an audio book on an airplane, but the headphone couldn't compete with the engine noise."
1,Horrible Quality,"I bought two pairs of these because they were so cheap.You get what you pay for.Both pairs were staticky right out of the box.I could jiggle the wires to get a better connection, but that's why I was getting rid of my previous (2 yr old ) headphones. These are just plain junk"
3,do not fit quite,"I bought these after purchasing an Ipod Touch, as I don't like the ear buds. They are cheap in price and the sound is good, but my problem is they need to adjust about one more notch for my small head. They stay on my head, but do not fit quite as snug as I like."
3,Head Phones,These are fair quality headphones for the price. They are a little tight on the head. I get better quality out of the ear speakers but they keep falling out.
5,Excellent sound,"I have tried a number of headphones (ear buds, clips, etc.) for my kindle fire but far and away this is the best set I have used."
2,So so,Ok for the money but not very loud. The bass is'nt very good andthe overall sound quality is'nt very good.
5,it's panasonic,"I once saw these at a store while looking for headphones. Was sick of the Sony headphones everywhere all the time due to the mediocre audio and bass of their consumer lines. When I saw these branded Panasonic it felt like the key to potential jackpot due to the price and brand. And lo and behold what powerful sound from such light weight low budget priced head phones. Definitely fatter/deeper bass than many big headphones 10x the price.Please forget scullcandy, beats by Dr Dre and other recent frauds. This is Panasonic and the sound of these highly affordable headphones show why it's such killer brand."
4,good buy,"These are great esp for the cost. Good bass sound, and although they are not the most expensive, they are comfortable as well. I would buy again and reccomend."
3,Important note on the size,"I got these because I wanted an extra pair of headphones and the price and reviews were amazing. The sound seems fine, though I'm no audiophile. I wanted to mention for the benefit of others that the band is quite tapered and also the tension is pretty tight, so when they are firmly seated on my head, they do feel tight. After an hour or so, they are uncomfortable to me and even hurt. If I loosen the band, it's a bit better but they slide around or fall off. For now I have to position them slightly off the front of my ears, which means the sound isn't as good. I'm hoping they stretch a little with use. In the meantime, use will be only for short periods."
3,Ok headphones,"You know the saying you get what you pay for. These don't fit very well and I was penny wise and pound foolish. It's a good product for a child who breaks things but for an adult that wants great fit and sound, unfortunately lacks in those departments."
4,Good for the price,Got these headphones for work. I draw blueprints and sometimes I listen to music. I didn't want to spend a ton of money but I'm happy with what I got.
3,headphones,Well they have lasted longer than the CD player I bought them to go with. Reality- the fit to my ears is awkward- otherwise they are fine
2,Not a 5-Star Product,"I saw many people rate this 4-5 stars. It's very misleading. This is certainly not a 5-star product. There's interference (scratchy noise in the back) unless you align the plug perfectly. The sound quality is average. I can perceive nothing special of the ""base"" that everyone keeps talking about.I guess an argument can be made for it being cheap. Even for the $5 (excluding shipping), though, I'd give this 2 stars, 3 at best.Summary: Not amazingly durable, sound quality is average at best, interference unless you align the plug perfectly. Bass seems overrated on these boards."
2,Headphones,"I could not use this product because it did not allow enough adjustment to fit me comfortably. When worn directly on my head, the earphones were partially below my ears and not comfortably snug against them. I suggest it be made a little smaller."
4,Decent for price.,These work well for casual listening. The sound is decent. For the money they are a good value. No issues.
5,Best ever!,"These headphones are absolutely the best I've found for listening to the spoken word, specifically audio books played on iPods. The bass range is just right, the fit is comfortable and the cord appears to be the optimum length. At this price, I bought several to store away for future use."
5,Great for the price!,"These have been my main ""working out"" headphones for almost a year now, and even after being repeatedly drenched in sweat, they still sound great!"
4,Panasonic Headphone Review,Panasonic RP-HT21 Lightweight Headphones with XBS port for increased bass responseTerrific deal for the money: good sound and far more comfortable than than those ear bud things that came with the IPod Shuffle and that keep falling out of your ears. Effective way (both cost and otherwise) for dealing with the tedium of elliptical trainers and exercise bikes.
4,Crystal Clear But.....,"I bought these based on the ""Frequency Response"" and customers reviews. They do sound great, good base and clear highs, but I could not get the volume out of them (like my last headphones) that I occasionally like to listen too. Ya every once in a while I like to listen to really loud music and these did not cut it. But if you don't care about cranking it up, these headphones are REALLY clear and good sounding, a good buy for the price."
1,Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones broke!,The headphones worked great for about 3 months (which is the warranty period) but then the slider that allows you to adjust the fit broke. I used them to listen while sitting. They are simply to frigle.
5,Great headphones for the price!!!,"I love these headphones!! Their bass response is great!!! They are very light and fit nicely on your head and ears without hurting you. I have also some Koss headphones and they are not even close to the Panasonics. At this price, I am buying more!!!I use them in my home recording studio for monitoring when my family is asleep or when I am either recording my acoustic guitars with microphones or recording my singer."
4,Panasonic Light Weight headphones w/ XBS port,Comfortable and clarity of sound. Well worth the money for those who spend hours on the phone and need their hands free for a keyboard.
4,Good Bass Okay Sound,"I am 13 years old and a music lover at heart. I go through at least 10 pairs of headphones a year, they never leave my neck. I listen to music at all times, accept in school of course. I prefer headphones that increase the bass and cancel sound around you (noise-canceling). These headphones are PERFECT, meaning that you can really hear the bass and not much else around you. The vocals are really good, and the sound comes through very clearly. I have had them for a month so far and they haven't disappointed me. The only thing is that they are made pretty big, and even the lowest setting is really long. I would not recommend them for running, I've tried and they have fallen off. I would stick to earbuds. But for dancing around the house, working, or on a long car ride, these headphones are definitely worth more then the price they are asking for. I am very impressed with the price (it was great to find a good pair of headphones under $15) and the sound quality overall."
5,great headphones,the headphones are light weight and economical. the quality of the sound is great. the headphones work well for all my students.
3,Not very loud,"I'll admit to a hearing loss. However, with all but dollar store quality headphones, I can get all the noise I need. These don't produce sufficient volume pushing them close to the sound level of $1 items. When I do jack up the MP3 player to near its limits, draining the battery, these produce a respectful, smooth sound way beyond their price. If you don't mind upping the volume by about 50%, these are a solid deal. For me, these won't replace any earbuds or headphones that I already had."
5,Best budget headphone ever,"This is probably the best 5 bucks you'll ever spend. Certainly on headphones. I had been using a $10 Koss over-the-ear headphone from Walmart. This one beats it hands down. I hear sounds that I haven't heard/noticed before on the Koss, my car stereo, my Altec Lansing VS2621 PC speaker, or my Harman Kardon HK395 PC speaker. I listen to all kinds of music: pop, folk, piano, country, hip pop, soul... this headphone produces wonderful sound for all of them. Highly recommended as a budget headphone."
4,"Good headphones, better price","Bought Panasonic headphones to complete my purchase to qualify for free shipping. Very satisfied with my purchase and with the service of Amazon, which as usual was *****. Happy new year to all"
2,too big for my head,"These work good for the low price, and the easy over head use, but sadly my head is way smaller than what these are intended for, wouldn't work for children then either. They're adjustable, but even on the smallest setting theres a huge gap leaving it not snug and easy to move around with them on :/"
2,Headphones,"Bought these based on the 4.5 rating here on amazon. Well, the bass is great like everyone says. And they are very comfortable on the head. But what sucks about this product is the the loudness of the mid-frequency range. It's pathetic. The bass and treble are overbearing compared to the mids. It's too bad. I would recommend my previous set of headphones, the Sennhieser 202. I hate when products don't live up to their hype. But what did I expect for $5 headphones?"
2,Not Comfortable,"The entire reason that I purchased these headphones was to find some comfort when I listen to music at work. These are not comfortable as they push on my ears because of how they are angled. While they are pretty lightweight, there is still some heaviness/pressure that makes them uncomfortable for long periods of wear. At least they were cheap."
3,Okay for the money,"Comfortable and certainly priced right. However deep tones not clear enough for me. I listen to audio books and lack of depth distorts narrators voices. Cost was negligible, therefore I didn't bother to return."
3,I Got What I Paid For,"When i originally purchased the headphones they were to be used with my laptop while downloading music. For that purpose the headphones were great. However, i have been using them at the gym and different story there. The sound quality and volume is not good at all, i need to have the volume all the way up on my ipod in order to hear the music, even then i still hear some background noise from the gym.The cord was fine, the band is comfortable and sound is ok if using at home with your laptop and no noise around you.However if you're looking for something to work out with, this is not for you. I will be looking for different headphones do use at the gym."
4,Amazing Sound For A Low Price But Slightly Uncomfortable,"I tend to go through headphones quickly because I'm constantly listening to music. If I don't lose them, they break, so I never spend a lot of money on them. Tired of earbuds, I decided to go with these over-the-head headphones. These headphones sound fantastic to my ears. The bass thumps wonderfully, and the sound is very crisp and clear. I do have a couple of issues with them though. First, sound leaks out of them pretty badly, especially in a quiet setting. I can set them down with music playing on a low volume and hear the song as clearly as if I had them on across the room. The other issue is the fit. Though they are adjustable, they're a little snug on my head near my ears, possibly because of my glasses. It's bearable, but it does get more and more uncomfortable over time. I usually wear them upside down (with the headband part hanging down by my neck). Despite the drawbacks, though, these are still pretty good headphones for the price."
5,"Durable, does the job!","I bought these headphones for my seven year old son... which means, they have been stepped on in the van, left in the hot car, shoved into a backpack- you get the idea. They still work! No, these are not the best headphones in the world, but they have done the job well for the purpose (to use with the leapster or ipod) and are still intact. I would buy these again, but I haven't needed to replace them a year later!"
4,The greatest under $5 headphones you'll ever own!,"I read the reviews on these things and thought ""What the heck?"" so I purchased two of these for the kiddies and couldn't believe the sound quality that came from these little things! I ended up stealing a pair for myself. I abandoned headphones for ear buds a few years ago and these things have convinced me to switch back. The sound quality is much better then any pair of ear buds I have ever owned. The only complaint is that they don't handle bass heavy music very well. I love these headphones so much that I'm purchasing another two after I finish this review. Do yourself and pick up a set and you can thank me later!"
5,Surprisingly good headphones,I wanted to buy inexpensive headphones that worked fairly well and I would not be upset if they got lost or broken. These fit that objective perfectly. They work very well listening to Pandora on my Kindle Fire. They are lightweight and comfortable and about a hundred times better than the throw away types you get on the plane.The only problem now is I will be very disappointed if they get lost or broken!
4,Not bad for the price and for summer,"I had another pair of headphones, but in summer my ears would get very sweaty if i wear them, and I hate the ones that you plug in your ears because they hurt after a while in my case. I bought this and they work just fine and the price is right"
5,If I could give them 10 stars I would,"I needed headphones for listening to music because the iphone original headphones hurt my ears. These headphones are terrific. The sound quality is amazing and crystal clear. The headphones are so comfortable I can wear them for a long period of time without ear pain. I also wear them while using my elyptical machine and they stay in place well being so light. The only thing I have noticed is when I work out with them my ears get a little sweaty but not enough to complain about. Get them, you won't regret it."
1,Worst purchase ever,"These were broken when I received them. The ear piece was snapped off the headband. I knew I was buying cheap, but I at least hoped to be able to use these for a short time. The shipping to return will be more than the price, so they are going right in the garbage."
5,Great headphones,Great product. It is my third pair i bought. Sound is clear. Only concern is to be carefull with wires in order to to jam them in drowers while you using them. Overall great product
4,Works ok,"It works ok, I think the volume is a little low with these headphones, even with both youtube and the computer volumes at the highest it doesn't get very loud."
3,Decent Cheap headphones,"If your ear buds are constantly falling out, then this is a good option for you. If you are expecting high quality sound from these cheap head phones, then buy something else.A decent pair of headphones to use while exercising.Cons:Headphone adapter fits loosely into the headphone jack.Sound quality is mediocrePros:A good value for the price."
5,What a deal!,"I paid $4.96. I just wanted something lighter to wear while doing chores, & thought at this price I'd get these headphones & not worry about less sound quality. BUT...I was floored by how good they sound. No, they're not going to sound like an expensive pair of headphones, but good gosh, for under five bucks they're amazing."
5,Ridiculously Low Price!,"As I write I'm listening to music on these phones. I certainly knew I wasn't getting the best phones on the market at under $5 (!!!) - but I'll tell you what, I got a lot more than $5 worth. My ears aren't built for the ear-bud type phones, I always use over the ear type. As much as I listen to music on my MP3 player, this is a great little set. There's nothing I'm not hearing. I'm currently listening to ""The YES Album"" (still a favorite...you 'old' prog lovers know what I mean!) Their music has quite a range of sounds...and I'm hearing them all nicely...from grinding bass to delicate acoustic guitar...not to mention Jon's incredible voice.If you don't want to spend 25, 50, 75 or 100 bucks for phones for your player, then by all means, pick these up.P J Penrose"
3,The Love Doesn't Last,"I waited to leave a review for this product and I'm glad I did. I ordered these headphones in November of 2011. When I first received them, I loved them. They sounded great. They still do. But today is March 2012 and I am unable to hear sound in the right ear piece. I can jiggle the wire and get it to come in temporarily, but if I move, it goes out again. I have not been abusive or allowed anyone else to be rough or abusive with these headphones, therefore, I have to rate them as inferior. Yes, I know they are inexpensive, but I expected them to last longer than four months."
3,"Works fine, a little big for my head","They don't adjust down to my size. I don't think I have a small head either. Sound quality is acceptable. Not fabulous, but not bad at all."
4,Inexpensive but good,"What I like about Amazon is that you often find things like this; headphones at a good price.These were sturdy, but no cumbersome. They fit great on my head and they didn't try press my ears against my head.The sound is good, and I would say they were above average in make and quality.Of course, the price was right as well."
5,One of those rare good deals,"I was skeptical that the other reviews must be too good to be true, but these headphones appear to be as advertised. They are a bit fragile -- I wish, for example, they had some strain relief for the wires where they leave the headset and frequently break -- but for the price ... buy these. The sound is very good and like others I'm not so fond of earbuds, particularly of *sharing* them. :)"
4,"Cheap, Good Headphones",These head phones are excellent considering they're so cheap. The only downside is they break easily. The sound is great.
4,"Great Headphones, Even Better Price","I bought 6 pairs of these headphones, because I am constantly wearing out the headphones I use for my computer. I have ended up giving all but two of the pairs away to family members, and Have used the same headset for 9 months now. That is unheard for me, I usually pull at the cords too much and break wires, lose the stereo sound, etc... I would reccomend these to everyone. The sound is fantastic, I watch alot of TV and Movies on my computer and the quality is terrific. I barely hear any background noise. My only complaint is that I wish the cord was about 1 foot longer."
4,Great Sounding Headphones,"I play online games. I have used headphones with a boom mic. I now use a USB Microphone and standard headphones. I have used inexpensive headphones and they sound bad. I tried these with the XBS Port, I have to say they sound great. They have excellent BASS. Overall frequency response is very good. The only bad point is there is no INLINE VOLUME CONTROL and the cord is about 4 feet. But for the price and Excellent Sound quality, They will be hard to beat. I would highly recommend these."
4,Good Value,"Good value for the price. I use them to watch DVDs and Netflix on laptop. They are very lightweight and comfortable, with good sound quality (left and right). Be aware though, they don't block out background noises."
5,I'm a transcriber and very pleased with the sound..,"Have used them two nights in a row for 8 hours each night and think they're fine. Surely not the absolute best (I've definitely spent more in the past), but they're lightweight and comfortable and work well. Cord could be a bit longer. Someone here said she didn't get the best sound from both sides, but I've not had that problem, happily. Good value, thus far, hope they last awhile."
4,Great budget headphones!,Enough bass to make it sound fine! Just a little uncomfortable to wear but you will get used to it! Great sound for a few bucks!
2,So-so sound,"Too much bass for my taste, not good for rock music, sound feels boxed.I have a pair of RCA's that I bought at Walmart for $5 many years ago and they have much better sound than these."
4,Value for money - but increased bass ?,"These function fairly well. I use it to listen to mp3's when I am at work, but I'm surprised at the description and some of the reviews which say this has enhanced bass response. In fact, I found the treble response to be good, and not the bass. I normally have the EQ settings for typical classic rock - a distended V, which should enhance the bass, but I didnt see the enhanced bass.The other shortcoming was the length of the cord. I had to buy an extender so I could comfortably move around on my chair in my cube at work, when connected to the PC.Anyway, I am happy with it, but the cost was doubled when I bought the extender."
5,Just what I was looking for at a really good price,"I needed a good pair of stereo headsets for my meditation tapes I use to go to sleep with and I needed a pair and for work to use with my laptop when I listen to music. I wear reading glasses at my desk and I don't like the earbuds and other over the ear headsets are very uncomfortable when I wear my glasses because they always fit too tightly. Also, I've found out that the earbuds are much worse for you hearing.When I came across these I saw they had the same stats as others which cost 4 times as much so I bought two pair and I am glad I did. They are so comfortable and cheap enough that I will get 2 more pair. One to keep in my gym bag & a pair for my 8 year old nephew when he is playing games on the computer. I don't want him to use mine plus he can have his very own set he uses when he visits his Auntie.Great deal and they sound pretty good to me and oh so comfortable.I got them for 4.99 at Frys."
4,"Low price, decent quality","I ordered these to use with an electronic drum set and listen to drums overlaid with music. They are perfectly adequate for this and while not quite at the same clarity as my px100s, I'm satisfied. They are worth 4 times the price imho."
2,Just OK,"Head phones are just OK. sound, fit in every way nothing to write home about. Sound cuts in and out. The plus is that they are light weight."
3,Panasonic RP-HT21 Headphones,Price was great and the sound is good but the fit is too large and there is no adjustment to make them smaller. A gentle shake to the head and they fall off my head. I am an average size woman so I did not expect to need special sizing for something like headphones.
2,"for the price, you get your audio","very limited in terms of audio options but for the price what else can u expect. works if you want a device just to listen to stuff in privacy but practically useless for any other situation. i bought it and one use later realized my folly. but then considering the price i paid, never returned it. now i just use it when i know all i need is a headset to LISTEN to. if you are looking for mic options, then go ahead and pay some more. this aint gonna work !!!"
5,More than Worth Your Money,Very solid headphones that are sturdy and flexible. What's most important is the sound quality; for 5 bucks you can't beat the bass output of these headphones. Audio is crisp and clear.
1,faulty product,"Right out of the box the wire near the jack was faulty. Not sure how that happens, but a product that cheap is bound to break and quick."
3,What's the big deal?,"I bought these because of the great Amazon user reviews. I was disappointed to find that this head set is no more than what it appears to be: an adequate, and typical product of it's class. Sound quality is OK, but inferior to the old Sony MDR G42 it was to replace. A general quibble is that the base of the connecting plug has a broad flange which prevents it from being inserted fully into my iPod Nano with the Griffin protective case in place."
4,headphones,"good headphones, sound good, no problems so far, shipping was on time, not late, overall satisfied with the product and shipping"
3,"my kids won't wear them, say too uncomfortable...","Maybe it's a personal thing... but my kids say they're too uncomfortable and for me, was a waste of money. I guess for someone else could be fine, especially at that price. You get what you pay for."
3,Basic headphone with basic quality,"This is basic headphone, a bit lacking on bass. But for the price under five quids, no complaints."
5,VERY GOOD!!,"These work very very well, I got them as a gift for someone and they are very happy with them thank you."
5,Excellent Headphones! Buy This!,"Looks of product/Quality: 5/5Operation of product: 5/5Overall: 5/5This is an excellent pair of headphones, with great looks, and amazing sound quality. They're very comfortable to wear. I recommend this product to anyone who wants a great pair of headphones with great sound quality for a really cheap price!"
3,Good cheapys.,Got two pairs of these as cheap ones i dont care if break or get lost. better sound then buds and can put a little bass. A little. But more then buds will. Worth having as spares.
1,Worthless!,They squeeze and pinch your head and hardly have any volume at all. Dont work as well as my partially shorted out similar Sony's. Dont believe the other reviews.They are worthless.
2,Disappointing,"Add this to the list of ""movies that could have and should have been great but weren't"".Richard Dreyfuss is just not slimy enough to play the campaign manager. Sorry, Richard. Chris Cooper is great as the dimwit candidate, but doesn't have enough material to work with. The plot drags, and overall, it's difficult to care what happens to whom.Don't waste your money. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the good parts already."
3,Not so silver,"Silver city was an ok political satire. Cooper is great as a Bush like Colorado gubernatorial candidate, and the private looks a little too much like Jeb Bush. The movie just isnt that funny and the satire is not that great. At times I felt bored. I was expecting more entertainment, especially since I'm not too fond of the right wingers."
3,"Silver City isn't a silver or gold medal, but a bronze","Silver City is a good movie, but a little slow. I wish it could have had more of Chris Cooper (who seems to act very much like Bush) and Richard Dryfuss (who seems awfully Cheney like). The movie wasn't as funny as the previews made it look and actually turns up to be a pretty good murder mystery full of oddball characters. It kind of reminded me of Primary Colors, with John Travolta, which was a mimic of Clinton and his skeletons in the closest. The movie never seems to step up and be true political satire or a full fledge murder mystery. It is somewhere in between, which actually reflects politics in today's world. Overall, it is an interesting movie and worth watching. It is very very slow at times, and I didn't really care for Danny Huston's character."
3,It could have been so much more,"I'm not going to sit here and lie to you. I first saw the trailer for Silver City while waiting to watch Fahrenheit 9/11. When I say the trailer I thought what I saw going to see was a movie similar to Primary Colors which I really enjoyed. Never again will I trust trailers.I thought this movie was going to be one of satire, however it was fleeting. Chris Cooper does fall into the roll like he was born to play or run? It's just too bad it was in this movie. Another thing that bugged the hell out of me was the plot line was darting all over the place. Just when you barely get to know a charter, BOOM! Off we go. Fear not, there are no spoilers here. Because there's not much of an ending.In a pre December, 2 I would still have to give this film 3 stars for the effort."
4,"excellent topic, fair story","Not the most engaging storytelling, but a worthwhile book. I'm still glad I got it for our church's children's library"
3,"Careless with names, cool with content","I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone interested in learning how the line between journalism and gossip has been forever blurred. But Walls--or her editor--glaringly mis-identifies some major players by name. For example, she calls former NBC news president Reuven Frank ""Frank Reuven"" and refers to Brown and Williamson scientist-whistleblower Jeffrey Wiegand as ""Jeffrey Wigland."" These mistakes are repeated in the book's index as well, along with some others. Somehow, I can't bring myself to give this more than 3 stars because the author's own errors in accuracy erode some of her credibility for me. Too bad, because otherwise, the book is exhaustively researched."
4,Excellent book,"A very good history on the convergence of gossip with poltics, entertainment and the media (television and magazines). However for recent events in the 1990's, Ms. Walls simply re-cycles old ""Gossip."""
4,The growth of gossip provides entertainment,"Not as lightweight as the title would have you believe, this overview of the growth of celebrity gossip is fascinating. The author chronicles the events which took gossip from a limited group of tabloids to the pages of some of the world's most prestigious newspapers as well as the surprising successful efforts of celebrities to control their public image."
5,It is a scale model kit,"Ready to assemble to support the infantry troops that are available through many groupings such as DMLDragon 1/35 U.S. Army Tank Riders 1944-45 (4 Figures Set) Gen 2and other kits. This tank is the famous Sherman for all that like this type of tank, find it, build it and by all means if you thinks it's a toy it is not."
2,Seller is not recommended,"Ok, first I admit that I did not read the description that said it was a plastic model. I looked at the photo and made an assumption it was a toy much like that from 21st Century or Forces of Valor. However the item never arrived so I could return it and the company is uncooperative in dealing with this issue, so I would never purchase anything from them ever again. The same thing happened with the other two items I ordered from them. Very bad service and stupid considering how many people can read this review or negative blog posts about them."
5,'If you ask me' by Libby Gelman-Wexner (Paul Rudick),Very glad to have this finally. I think it might be out of print. Many thanks.
5,Great book!,I thought just because I didn't read a book I didn't have they stink.But I was wrong.This book was great!
5,The Best Series in the Entire World!!!,"I love the Animorphs!! They are definetely the coolest books ever written. I'm a huge fan. I've been reading them since they came out in June 1996, when I was twelve. I'm fourteen now, and I am calling bookstores and coming here to Amazon.com nearly every day to find the newest books to update my collection (1-19, A.C.,M.M.#1)!!! My praise to K.A. Applegate for creating the Animorphs!!! <The Yeerks are among us!!>"
4,Great fun!,"Earthlings, invaded by aliens worm-like creatures that take over their host, are woefully unaware of the danger imposed by these detestable creatures. Only five children stand in the way of Earth's demise. Given the ability to change into any animal species by contacting and copying its DNA pattern these unlikely heroes embark on a quest to save the planet.This book will keep elementary, junior high, and the young of heart reading to find out what will happen next. Easy to read, this elegant book is sure to be a hit!"
5,Great book,"I bought this book for my 9 yr old, after a friend suggested it. My child could not put the book down and finished it in 2 days and started begging me for the next one. Guess it was a hit :)"
2,Animorphes ries too hard to be moving and dramatic,"I am writing this review not for just the first book, but the whole series. I used to enjoy Animorphs but they have become well, tiring! All this stuff about seeing horrible things and battles that Applegate tries to make dramatic and moving just gets more boring as it goes on! Animorphes are great for young childeren but for those who like it and start to read more of them notice that there is a pattern that goes on here, these books try to be not just an action quick read but to be a dramatic and moving one as well which definantly does not work."
1,Talk about corny!,"I used to really like these books. After a while they got boring. It's always the same. A problem arises, They turn into some animal and go beat the yeerks. They're so serious and there's no comedy. Being so serious makes it really corny in a way if you know what I mean."
1,THIS BOOK WAS O.K,"This book was O.K.The author did a good job of adding action and keeping me reading, but it was a little bit much. I think that the author should rewrite this book."
5,The invasion begins....,"In this first installment of the bestselling ANIMORPHS series, five unique teenagers -- Jake, Rachel, Tobias, Cassie and Marco -- are given the power to morph into any animal they touch by a dying Andilite who had come to Earth to save our plannet from his species' enemies. After experiementing with their new abilities, the group attempts to save Jake's brother, who has been made a slave by the enemy alien race the Yeerks. For first sequel see ""The Visitor""; series continues after ""Visitor"" with 52 more exciting titles."
5,A great book about 5 kids who acquire the power to morph,"I thought the book was extremley good for a science-fiction book. I never used to like science-fiction books, but now I'm hooked! The book is about 5 kids who acquire the power to morph into any animal after recieving their DNA pattern. They got this power from an alien, an andalite, to be exact. I would recommend this book to anyone, any age. Even if you don't like sci-fi books you are sure to like this book,so give it a try."
4,Great series for middle grade readers,"I'm so glad they brought this series back. When kids find a series they like, they immediately have a place to go when they finish a book to start another book and keep reading.I am a bit too old to have read these books myself, and my older daughter didn't read them either, but this is right up my 8-year-old son's alley!The story is quick-paced and inventive -- a bunch of kids (young teens) come across a crashed alien spaceship. The alien is dying, but friendly, and he takes the time to warn the kids that earth is in danger from the Vissers, some bad shape-shifting aliens. He also gives the kids the power to change into different animals, which they will use to battle the aliens.It's action-packed, but appropriate for 2nd or 3rd graders on up."
5,Still just as good as I remembered,"I used to love this series when I was young. I'm now 21 and a few months ago I decided to reread them. I wasn't too sure how much I'd like them since they are ""kids books,"" but boy, I was hooked. I read all 54, and the 10 or so extras in just a few months. These books are probably my favorite books of all time, and I've definately read my fair share of books from every age group and genre."
5,I still remember four years ago....,"I still remember when I discovered this book four years ago. I was at the Scholastic Book Fair, looking for a book with excitement and adventure. My librarian recomended Animorphs, and I got everthing a person can possibly dream for. There is action and suspense. There are battles and fights. There is shock and emotion. There is the war between good and evil. Then, I was taken far into the air.... I was given the description of what it is like to be an animal. I felt the instinct, the emotion, the fear, the suspense. I was in a dream, a nightmare. The book was full of vivid descriptions, powerful emotions, and a thrill of adventure. It is everything you ever dreamed of. You'll love it!"
3,"Good, but a warning","This book was good, but I jsut want to warn you about the Animorphs: they're good at first, but you get sick after about 28 books. I was sick of it by the 28th book. I used to lvoe them, but then it was like, 'OK, Uh, what is this?' It got so that the plots were cheap and hokey, and the character development was very little. So just that you know, they do get boring fairly quickly."
5,"ANIMORPHS IS #1, BUT MINDWARPS IS #2","I LIKE ANIMORPHS A LOT, I ALSO LIKE MINDWARPS. I THINK THAT C. ARCHER SHOULD TEAM UP WITH K.A. AND HAVE A SERIES WITH THE ANIMORPHS AND THE KIDS FROM MINDWARPS. THIS IS THE FIRST BOOK AND IT IS THE BEST. ANIMORPHS AND MINDWARPS RULE!"
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a very interesting book. If you have read any other Animorph book before this, YOU NEED TO READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FACTI live in Japan.SO WHAT?It means that it is a book that even a Japnese (who can read English, of course) like it.SO?BUY THIS BOOKKKKKK!!!!!!!"
5,How it all began,"I didn't know how to rate this book.I would give 8 because it's not as good as the other Animorphs and a ten for K.A. trying.To be fair I gave it a 9.In this book You learn about How It all began.How Tom was infested.How Tobias was trapped and of course how they got there morphing power from the wounded Andalite Prince.Prince ElfangorIn some ways I agree with the reader from Seattle,Washington That it's not as good as the others but in some ways he/she is wrong.It's a great book for a first animorphs book.Even if you did read another Animorph book it did not describe the begining in such detail."
5,The Story Begins,"5 kids, Jake, Marco, Cassie, Tobias, and Rachel. Are walking home from the mall when they witness the crashing of a alien ship. The Alien tells them that the human race is in trouble and that other aliens named Yerrks are trying to destroy us, no enslave us. So without regret the alien, Elfangor, give them technology of his race, the andilites, the technology he gives them is the power to absorb the DNA of any living animal and become it. From that day on they become rebel fighters agianst the Yerrk Empire. A truly amzing story, that will live on forever."
5,Whew.,"I'm a sensitive middle-aged guy, with gay friends and a positiveloving attitude. This album still rocks. If Wagner gets greatreviews then Metal Mike should have a statue somewhere - we willall know the Apocalypse is at hand when the R&R; Hall of Fame votesthese guys in. BTW a one-eyed woman I knew loved ""Lights Out,""proving that cool people come in all varieties."
4,Undeniable Influence,"A great album most people don't know about, 'Back From Samoa' along with the EP 'Inside My Brian' are two classics that anyone who is into early 1980's California punk must own. When this came out on vinyl, the first side (tracks 1-7 ""Gas Chamber"" thru ""Homosexual"" - a track credited to 'J. Falwell') was such a blast, the second side paled in comparison. All 14 tracks were over in about 22 minutes. Its also interesting that, shortly after the Samoans covered ""Time Has Come Today"", the Ramones issued their own version as a single (it also appears on 'Subterranean Jungle'). However, as an alternative to buying this disc, I would suggest 'The Unboxed Set' which contains everything from 'Back From Samoa' and 'Inside My Brain' along with other tracks (a total of 43 songs). Having 'Inside My Brain' and 'Back From Samoa' on the same disc is great!"
1,don't waste your time,I usally like Evanovich - but his book was so dumb I never finished it.Guy wants to really marry girl after 1 day ... girl gets kidnapped - but it's okay because it just the locals doing the kidnapping - just like in the Plum books .. old lady with a gun and attitude.It wasn't even dumb funny. just dumb.
3,Good One,This is a fast read cute funny romance...And Elsie is in this one also and she has her gun...get ready to crack up!!!Great Stocking Stuffer!!!
1,Mindless filler,"Wow, what an inane waste of paper! As a true fan of the Stephanie Plum volumes 1 through 13, I expected the usual lighthearted humor mixed with a whimsical mystery. What I wasn't prepared for was the mind-numbingly stupid and obvious plot. Since I don't want to give away any of the already weak and pointless story for those who might enjoy it, suffice it to say this is one for the recycle bin."
2,OK,"All Stephanie books are great. I have read about 90% of the rest and they are just not the same standard. Janet has come a long way since she wrote these early books. Early versions of Stephanie's grandmother are well developed, but I have been disappointed by other aspect - plots, plausability, quality of romance. She does still manage to capture the cities and the people who live in them"
2,Just OK,I really like Janet Evanovich But I was really disappointed with this one she seemed rushed getting this one out it was to short and not well written.
1,Don't waste your time...,This book was silly and a waste of time. The characters (with the exception of Elsie Hawkins) were absolute idiots - not believable at all. The humor fell flat. This was not up the usual standard to which I hold most Janet Evanovich novels.
1,No-Brainer,"How does a limited author like this ever get to be a best seller?? I should strike my pen to paper or my fingers to a keyboard. Very poor context and content. No plausability. Predictable, and adolescent.. I have read books intended for younger readers and found more merit. First book I have read by this author, and certainly my last. $7.99 I could have spent much more wisely. Only simple minds should take note or spend thier dime."
3,Cute,"I enjoyed the book. It is typical janet, romantic with a flare of comedy. It is an easy read that is very enjoyable."
3,"light, okay","I generally enjoy Evanovich's books, but this one wasn't quite as engaging. The characters were quirky, the situation was impossible, and sometimes Evanovich makes it work! Not so much this time. While the end was predictable, I still left the book thinking it wouldn't really work out that way. I'd recommend getting a different book."
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"$7.99 for a 200 page book (with big print and even bigger margins) is insane. Especially when it's a reprint. The story isn't bad, but it isn't great -- you can tell it's old. It certainly isn't worth $7.99."
1,Pure crap,"I fell for it; went and bought this book. Read it in no time flat, though very soon into the book I already knew it was a piece of junk. Stupid, unbelievable characters. We're supposed to believe that Hank (the main guy character) in madly in love with the girl character in a single day.I love the Plum series, even though I am getting sick of it, too, since it never advances, but these little previous books of Evanovich's show the practice work before she came up with Stephanie Plum. Every character and setting and even the dialogue is the same in all the books. The only exception is that by the Plum series, Evanovich finally got it right.Don't waste your money or time."
2,Last try for early Evanovich,"Like most of the other reviewers here, I bought Wife for Hire because I love Evanovich's Plum Series. I have tried other of her earlier romance stories and been disappointed but, ever the optimist, thought I'd give it another go. This is the last attempt. The situation was highly artificial--a guy pretending to be married so his father will loan him money, though it turns out the orchard would have survived without it--and the guy falls for the girl in less than one day. There was no build up for it, as the girl responds pretty immediately to him, too. There was no attempt to distinguish between sexual attraction and love or to build from one to the other. The story was really rushed. The only high point was the madcap comedy involving the townspeople."
1,"No real plot and a general, simple story line","This book just didn't rub me the right way from the get-go. While I did like Maggie and her crazy, disapproving Mom and Aunt, the rest of the book just made no sense. It seemed like Evanovich was in the hurry-up-and-wait mode when she wrote this book. The plot line was nonexistent and the only interesting part of the book was thrown away in the end. So much of the book was pointless and you knew exactly what was going to happen."
3,An OK book to read,"Generally I find Janet Evanovich's books to be very entertaining. I love the Plum series and recommend it. This book, however is just OK. I think that Evanovich jumps in to the attraction between Hank and Maggie way too soon. I really think that there should have been some time in there before their relationship started to blossum. It would have made the book a lot more interesting. I do have to say that parts of it are hilarious. I think that the housekeeper, Elsie Hawkins is a very strong character. She reminds me a lot of grandma from the Plum series."
3,good..interesting..,good.. interesting..but I am more interested where Nora is than where the Cafe is
1,Poor workmanship,"I purchased this dresser and found that it was easy to assemble. However, the holes in which to place the drawer guides were improperly drilled. After assembling the whole thing, the drawers would not fit into it. The holes were drilled 2 inches too high. The top drawer hit the top of the dresser top and wouldn't shut. The bottom drawer had a 2 inch space below it!<br />I returned it to Target; but because they only had one other one (which they said was a ""new"" one) I was unable to get a replacement. I had to just get credit for it, instead."
1,Nice on the outside only,"This item is like a Hollywood set. Looks like the real deal on the outside and very temporary looking inside. The drawer bottoms you could punch your fist through if you tried. It's not what you would consider hardwood. It took almost 3 weeks to arrive after ordering. 5 parts arrived damaged. It took another week to get those replaced and then 2 arrived broken. Over a month into this process I still don't have a chest of drawers. The problem is poor engineering. This one looks nice, but I would keep looking."
1,Not a good buy,"I didn't even get to assemble this when it arrived because it was broken in the box. Luckily that gave me the chance to see that it was particle board inside, and very loosely packed particle board at that. Practically nothing but sawdust. Possibly the most flimsy piece of furniture i have ever seen-and i even shop at Ikea!shipped it back, losing more money on it."
4,I've tried this,"We had a guy selling this stuff outside our campus bookstore in Bradford, Pennsylvania. I've been taking an environmental communications class this semester, and we've just covered the effects of green edvertising - eco-friendly commercials that make consumers do things for the environment.So I know a little about adverts and how they make people act sometimes. The guy was friendly enough, offered me a shot of whatever I wanted, and gave me a keychain.I tried this and the blue citrus, and this flavor hides the bitterness of all energy drinks very well; it's sweet like soda pop is, so I liked it best.This stuff's got caffeine, taurine, and guarana in it. I would research before you considered drinking a lot of it.But does it taste like it's going to give you wings? No, it's actually OK in the flavor department."
3,Very well writen,"Very good book, not the typical, ""guts and glory"" book. General comments, not meant to be criticism: 1) very few people know how to pronounce Di An; readers might be interested in its unusual pronunciation. 2)dog story--don't know if the writer saw it but dogs were useful to show the average soldier just how tough he was. Dogs have no stamina and infantry walk them into the ground. 3) Viet Nam Memorial, surprised that as infantryman, the writer does not point out the glaring error of one statue and why it is shown. Not all readers know it. 4)Mentions ARVN troops removing clothing to die naked. More to it than that, as many, many NVA also removed clothing and died naked. Only saw it done when situation was hopeless."
5,"A great, artistic read","I can't make any claims to the validity or non-validity of the book's subject matter, but I found the whole book engrossing from beginning to end. The man's private motivations and trials may not belong to everyone, but I think they are deep and true enough so that anyone can understand them. They are mixed in with commentary about the war from the author's viewpoint then as a young man and at the time of writing, and is also filled with the nerve wracking, often spooky action of that period in that place, which creates its own atmosphere along the lines of Dispatches by Herr. This book is not to be missed."
3,It's a bracelet,"Not much to say about this thing. I wore it as a fashion statement when I was infinitely obsessed with useless crap. I mean, it is just a bracelet. It was made of plastic? I lost it after not caring about it for a while."
5,Great results,My wife wanted this book to find out Marilyn Monroe's makeup secrets. I'm not complaining.
5,Tricycle wheel found!,"I was restoring a 1940's tricycle for my son and one of the rear wheels had been damaged. I looked all over at restoration websites and industrial catalogs and couldn't find an appropriate spoked replacement wheel. There were plenty of solid hubs, but no spoked wheels. Finally I searched Amazon and there it was.Thanks"
5,I don't get it!,"I don't understand why shows like Out of Practice and The Class get cancelled. They were great, funny, smart sitcoms, that people want to see. I think many are tired of reality shows. You see it reading reviews that people write. So if so many people want good sitcoms, how do they end up cancelled. I love How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory and Rules of Engagement. If any of those are cancelled, it may finally be the push I need to stop watching CBS. Whoever is running the station, obviously is not in tune with what people want."
5,The Show Must Go On!!!!,"You know what they say, ""The show must go on"". I think that saying totally applies here. Out of Practice is like one of the few good sitcoms left out there, and all of the sudden CBS tries to take it away, my day was all good until I looked at the TV guide and saw that OoP had been pulled. Out of Practice has a great mix of characters, my fav. would have to be Dr. Lydia Barnes, and Dr. Regina Barnes, both incredibly funny. I love this show, you would too if you gave it a shot."
2,"Maybe it's just be, but...","unless you are completely oblivious of anything relating to sex, I would not order this dvd. I mean, if you have never read a Cosmo magazine or anything, then go ahead. I would recommend this for an older couple who has never had sex, or has any painfully obvious questions you want answered. Or maybe if you are a lonely (virgin) guy and know nothing about yourself sexually. Hope this was helpful."
1,Ridiculously Bad,"It's funny how it seems that most videos by Sinclair are just outright poor in pretty much every way according most reviews... This is no exception... Poor quality production value, very UNATTRACTIVE couples, crappy looking sex, simply all around unpleasant. If you actually do give MONEY for this, remember this review. Worse than the ""2 Girls 1 Cup Reaction""!!Buy at your own risk. There's far too many nicer things you can buy for $23 that your loved would enjoy instead of *this*... If you do buy it, remember this post... you'll see everything here was and is true in my representations for you.GTHRC"
5,Common Sense That Isn't Necessarily Common Knowledge,"This book is chock full of information that might well be common sense. But are these things common knowledge? It's too late to hone your basic living skills after disaster has wielded it's blow. Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, civil unrest .. these things can strike without a moment's notice. The practical, easy to understand and follow information in this book could one day save your life or that of a loved one. This book is right next to our First Aid kit, and it's been read by every family member. We hope we'll never have to use these emergency measures, but it certainly is a comfort to have this kind of organized information at our fingertips. Hats off to the author."
3,Broad but general,"If you can read the very tiny print in this book, you will find it gives decent basic material that is helpful but it covers too many areas to be really in depth in any of them. However, some areas were quite good and the illustrated shelters was excellent. For general info, it would be fine and is small enough to be portable so you could take it with you in an emergency."
5,"I really can't review this yet, but...","First impressions are great. I like it more than the s/t. A great set of new songs, and I get to see them on the tour! They may not be as memorable as City, but they are more complicated, and after all the music Devin as made, it's frankly amazing he hasn't repeated himself yet. The s/t disk seemed to be a little out of ideas, but Alien is fresh and new in every department except the lyrics. For some reason Devin decided on some tracks to make the lyrics just like old SYL material, without the clever word play and real life significance. ""S**tstorm"" is a good example. I think if he wants to say he's pissed off, he should still be poetic about it like he was on songs like ""Cod Metal King"" or even ""Oh My F**king God"". Other lyrics are great though, like the ones to ""Skeksis"" and ""Shine"". All in all, this is more classic Devin Townsend material."
3,"Its Strapping, but nothing new(edited for 7-2006)","This album sounds like Strapping. period. Theres nothing new about the sound, or the playing. Gene still amazes, Devin stills screams, but we have all heard it before.I suggest picking up city or their self titled album before buying this, because in my mind, those albums stand out more than this one.One final point: definitely check out their dvd ""for those aboot to rock.""edit- i thought i should edit this a bit after listening to the album a bit more. i also had the chance to see strapping live and finally, i heard ""the new black.""after all of the above this album deserves 4.5 stars. its absolutely brutal and no metal band out there comes close to the madness that is strapping(within this time period. see my review for ""the new black"")"
1,Alrighty ....,"Let's see -- they sound like a brain damaged monkey ... with a metal plate in its head ... dying horribly in a garbage disposal.I'm reasonably confident that I've had bowel movements that resulted in greater creativity and listening enjoyment. Hrm, maybe I can get a record contract, just like SYL. Seems there's a market."
1,"One Word ""SUCK""","This is the worst band I have ever heard of in my life. They remind me of a harder Darkness, this does not help at all. When are metal bands going to wake up and stop singing ""high notes"", horrible. Please do not buy this or anyother CD. They are even worse live. THE 1980's are DEAD!"
3,Nothing to write home about,"It was cute, but not something to spend money to see. It was more one of those movies that you would be fine watching if it was on TV."
5,Funny,I enjoyed this movie it was pretty funny. Katherine Heigl was greatIt's similar to the Bounty Hunter movie of Jennifer Aniston
4,What Were the Critics Thinking?,"All the supposed story ""flaws"" the critics blamed on the screenwriters and Ms. Heigl are in the original novel. Including the narration. If ""One for the Money"" has a flaw, it's that it is too faithful to its bestselling source. INCREDIBLY faithful.True, this flick would have probably played better on HBO or Showtime, but that's only because it is low on explosions and high on old fashioned storytelling--just the opposite of today's usual theatrical popcorn flick. And Heigl is as charming as ever. Too bad wrongheaded critics gang-jumped the film during its theatrical run and destroyed any chance it had for sequels. Then again, if Heigl would return to TV--cable TV that is--then perhaps we could have more Plum fun."
3,Really lacked the hilarity of the books....,"I love the actors that were chosen for this movie, and I was excited to see it. However, the movie really lacked so much of the chemistry and dialogue that was so great about all the Plum books. The movie fell short. I tried to just watch the movie for pure entertainment value as well, trying not to compare it to the books. However, it seemed disjointed and slow. Sad, because I think a better script and this movie could have turned a lot of folks on to the books and really done well enough to warrant a sequel. I only see sequels going downhill from here."
4,Pretty Good!,"Katherine Heigl is sexy and she did damn good n this movie. Not the best of hers, but not the worst."
3,worth watching,"Not anywhere near as good as the books, but still a cute movie. Hoping for more oomph in the next one - hoping for a next one."
4,One for the Money,"I have read all the books in the series and loved them! I enjoyed this movie, and have alwaysw appreciated Katherine & Jason. But I think the supporting characters could have been better cast. Took away from it a bit. Definitely an enjoyable viewing."
4,Cute! Good acting.,Good plot and well acted performances. Strong female lead. Gritty cinematography fits the NJ locale. Why don't we see more of Katherine Heigl?
1,Ugh.. Vanity,"Terrible, not worth it, not even as a rental which is what I did. There is no charm, nothing that even comes close, other than story line, of the what kicked off a fun book series until book 10. Katherine Heigl is just terrible, there is no Stephanie Plum here it is attempt by Katherine Heigl to be flirty and cute; it doesn't work.Now that the book series has crashed and burned, it is appropropriate that the movie do the same. So sad, such potential."
3,"It was okay, definitely not great","I almost always enjoy a good Katherine Heigl movie but One For the Money in my opinion was subpar. The worst part of the whole film was her attempt at an accent. The first 5 minutes of the movie she doesn't have one and then she walks into her cousin's bail bond shop and the assistant has a really thick accent and amazingly Katherine finds herself with a really thick accent as well. The rest of the movie was fairly torturous as it would appear and dissolve randomly. I found it incredibly distracting but if you can get passed that, you may enjoy it.As for the plot, I found it to be a little weak as well. There were a few scenes that kept my interest but otherwise I found myself daydreaming. There really wasn't anything too clever, funny, action-packed, mysterious... nothing that stood out. Just an okay movie with a couple good scenes."
1,A Disaster,"One For the Money should be a case study in how not to adapt a successful book series for the big screen. From the bad casting of Katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum to the poorly written script to the flat direction, this film was horrible. Who in their right mind thought Heigl was a good choice at Stephanie? As for the rest of the cast, Jason O'Mara is a very good actor but so wrong for the part Joe Morelli. Daniel Sunjata was an OK Ranger, but really didn't inhabit the part. The only good casting was Rex the Hamster.One can only hope Janet Evanovich got the rights back."
1,Awful,Seriously one of the worst movies i've seen in some time. Heigl's acting was horrible and the plot was childishly overdone. Don't waste your time!
1,very disappointing,"I too am a HUGE fan of the written Plum books and wanted to love this film...but didn't!First of all fire the director, casting director, and the script writer. Characters had NO chemistry and the men were extremely miscast. Morelli and Ranger were no way near hot enough and all of the cast rambled through mediocre lines with about as much passion as a wet paper towel. What a shame because it had such potential. After seeing the movie I took the dvd off my wish list.There wasn't much urgency with the Ramirez threats either so that didn't work in the movies favor either. Overall the filmmakers were too worried about their rating and cut the film back too much. The end effect was choppy and uneven.I prefer to go back and reread my books that are perfect! Sorry KH, but you didn't make a great Stephanie. And this character deserved to be great..."
1,Suck age,"I LOVE these books,I was happy when I heard the movie was being made, then I cried whe I heard who was playing stehenie plum. I forced myself to go and used my fee passes from my birthday cause I refused to pay for it. Could NOT handle it! The jersey accent she does goes in and out in every scene. The acting is flat and only 3 people were cast in a good way. The grandma, joe and lula. Other then that re cast for a sequal."
4,One For the Money,"Based on one book, I hope they make more from this series of stories. It was just a fun, relaxed movies with action and humor, Shipped in a timely manner."
4,Stephenie Plum,"I enjoyed the book. The grandmother is the best in the book, however, she did not get as much screen time as I would have liked."
1,Not One For The Money,"Apparently this movie is based on a book. I hope the book is much better than the movie, which in most accounts, the books are much better than any Hollywood rendering of any book title. The movie did move along rather quickly only because I found myself wandering off. In other words, this movie is not very engaging. It certainly was a waste of time. Is there a way to get a refund on lost time?"
3,One for the money not one for the record book,"One for the Money, a movie based one Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels, is a medium to good movie. At 1 1/2 hours it is too short and leaves much of the humor of the novels (which had me laughing myself off whatever chair I was sitting in) out of this movie. It would have been better to have a longer movie with the humor in it. Heigl does a very good Stephanie Plum, as well as O'Mara in the role of Morelli. Sunjata lacked the charisma of Ranger, a role better suited to someone like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. I'll look forward to any sequels, hopefully better done than ""One"". All problems aside, it was still a diverting little movie that didn't make me consider suing someone to get the 90 minutes back. :-)"
5,Great movie...did NOT read the books:),"I thought it was a great movie. Katherine Heigl does a great job, cute & fun, yet plenty of mystery and intensity! I wanted to write this review as coming from someone unfamiliar with the books. All the reviews I read before watching this were from people that had read the books and were basing there reviews off of there comparison of the book and the movie. Having nothing to compare it against, I have no complaints about the male actors they chose, which some reviewers seemed disappointed with. I thought they were great!However, I do disagree with the Amazon's statement describing the movie that it's a film ""great for the whole family"". Katherine's character at one point is completely naked trying to cover her breasts with her arm similar to how Sandra Bullock does in ""The Proposal"". Except Katherine has a lot more breast to cover, or not be covered. A little too much skin and breast showing to be comfortable having my kids watch it:("
2,Action that's boring and a romance that doesn't work.,"I'm sure others love this movie, and you might. It's kind of ""war of the roses"", which I hated. I don't feel like there is any chemistry in the romance of the story, and don't believe heigl pulled off the action at all."
2,Pushing it to rate it two,"I love the books. They are funny and the characters are fully fleshed out. I did not finish watching because I thought everyone was miscast and even the house in the burg was also made ladylike, much like Grandma Mazur with her perfect makeup."
2,Very disappointed!,"Janet Evanovich fans waited a very long time for a movie to be made from her Stephanie Plum books. Well, One for The Money (the movie) is a huge disappointment. It was poorly cast, poorly directed with unenthusiastic acting, and unwatchable in my opinion."
2,Lame and Uninspired,"Everything you have heard about this lame and uninspired film is true. Even if you are a fan of the Stephanie Plum series, you will find this film lacking in story, pacing, and acting ability. The entire cast is miscast and hampered by a poor script that barely captures the likability of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels. Thankfully it will only take an hour and a half of your time to watch this film, so do so if you want a bland diversion for the evening. The film plays out like an incomplete pilot for a TV series which I suspect was how it was originally developed. It has just enough information to introduce the viewer superficially to the characters without really getting to know them. The setting of Trenton, New Jersey is superficial as well and captures none of the uniqueness of this working-class urban area."
2,not so much...,This film generally put a frown on my face. I was not the least bit entertained. Finger drum finger drum...
2,MY GRADE: C plus.,"Tale is about a woman (Katherine Heigl) who loses her job at Macys as a lingerie manager and in desperation takes on a job as a bail enforcement agent. Don't worry. She's from the working class neighborhood so she can handle herself. The plotting of the story is done well enough but the humor is almost always a miss and the chemistry between the two love interests is generally just average or lower. Debbie Reynolds (a very big deal back in the day) plays the grandmother. The family connection was done somewhat well, too, but man if only the humor and chemistry had been higher this would have been a good or better movie.This film was based on the 1994 novel of the same name by Janet Evanovich. The budget for this picture was $40M but it only made a bit over $36M at the Box Office (Wiki).STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; HUMOR: C minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B;ROMANTIC CHEMISTRY: C minus to C; OVERALL GRADE: C plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of May 2012."
3,A little disappointing.,"Having read the books, the movie just didn't hit on the basis of the books. Heigl was a good choice, but the casting company did not do a good job depicting the other characters."
1,ugh,"Good Lord. This was terrible. How many ways can you say terrible. Ugh. Useless, not even remotely believable. Worst movie I've seen in many a year."
3,OK movie,I was hoping this movie would be better. The book is really funny and somehow the movie does not seem as entertaining.
2,Disapointed,"Fans of Janet Evanovich's books, don't look for any sequels to be made. This one doesn't cut it. Jason O'Mara is excellent as Morelli, Katherine Heigl is OK as Stephanie Plum but Daniel Sunjata as Ranger is dreadful. Talk about lacking personality and lacking chemistry with Heigl, wow! John Leguizano, who plays the villan, would have been a better Ranger even if he's too old for the part. At least he has a personality. The movie also doesn't capture writer Evanovich's wonderfully zany sense of humor. Sherri Shepard as Lula is a pleasant surprise in a too-small role."
5,Pretty true to the book!,"I've read all of the Stephanie Plum books and I love them. This movie was pretty consistent with the book. Katherine does a fairly nice job with Stephanie's character.... the book is very tongue in cheek with the humor and the Stephanie's character gets embroiled in situations that are not going to happen in real life, but that's why you read right? To escape life and live a fantasy....I thought the movie was pretty good with making the literary character one you could watch. I hope there are going to be more movies of Stephanie Plum. Oh and Morelli was hot like in the book but the Ranger in the movie is not nearly as dangerous, sexy and bad boy as he is in the book!"
3,One for the money - book was so much better,Katherine Heigl was well cast for the role. The book was much better. Liked the Ranger character -- didn't like the Joe Morrelli character. Pictured Joe Morrelli much differently.
3,funny but predictable,Its not bad. Sweet and funny. The ending was not as great because I expected more kissing between the two main characters.
4,One for the money,It was funny and lots of laughs. Very cute movie. Katherine Heigi is pretty and funny. A must see movie.
2,Disappointing,This movie had good potential but failed to deliver. The acting is subpar and the lines are soap opera cheesy. I really like Heigl and I believe she could have done a lot better. It is barely a decent movie if you have two hours to waste.
3,Not as good as the book,"This was a fun movie which I enjoyed seeing and would recommend, but if you have read the book ,it doesn't compare. The actors cannot possibly live up to the characters in your mind. All in all a good movie."
4,Pretty good movie,The movie was enjoyable and the quality of it was very good. I had no streaming issues and picture quality was good.
1,Way over rated...,"Do not be fooled by the high rating as I was. No more than 1 star at best. Not sure what the goal was with this film but it just did not work for me. Lots of technical errors as well. If you are a police film person you really need to lower your expectations when you watch this one. I read through a bunch of the multi-star reviews and it seems the vast majority all read the books. I would guess they are filling in the shortcomings of this film with their memories, familiarity and fondness of the characters in the books thus making the film seem better to them than it really is. I found myself watching to see how many tech errors I could pick out and how many absolutely unrealistic plot twists would take place rather than to be entertained. This will be the film K.H. will want everyone to forget. There will never be a sequel. Watcher beware!"
5,great flick,i would recamend this film to anyone. great story line and it kept my attention the whole way through nice job
3,funny,The movie was better than expected but not as good as the book. Casting wasn't as good as it could have been. If you haven't read the books you will probably like the movie
3,"Didn't convey the humor, and develop the characters like the books","It seemed to me that this was completely miss-cast. Catherine Heigl was the only one even attempting to sound Jersey. That said, it was entertaining. Catherine Heigl is hot, Lula was great. How could a Plum movie not be fun, but imagine some more ""My Cousin Vinny"" types cast in the movie. Imagine Marisa Tomei as Stephani Plum........."
3,Okay but not great,Not a bad movie if you're looking for something to fill the time. Good deal if you have Amazon Prime and can watch for free. I wouldn't pay to watch it.
3,Mindless Entertainment,"This is no great movie but bits of comedy intertwined with mindless entainment. Basically, it is okay but some of the characters were not what I envisioned when I read the book."
1,Terrible,"I read the series and I can't see Katherine Heigl being a believable Stephanie Plum, the accent was so off. Being from the east coast, they could've picked a no name actress to play the part. I stopped the movie within 10 mins"
5,wonderful!,"I really do not understand the bad reviews this movie received at the hands of the professionals. The movie was fun, lively, cute, and for a Stefanie Plum fan, faithful to the spirit (and plot) of the book. My wife and I are hoping for sequels."
4,One for the Money,I have read all the Janet Eavonvich Setf Plum books and this movie comes close to the book.I hope the next movie has more lulu and grandma in cause they just touched on it in this movie.Can't wait for the next movie.
2,Didnt buy Hiegel in Role,"Read the book, it wasnt my favorite, so it was no surprise THE MOVIE DIDNT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS. ITS ACCEPTABLE AT BEST, DRAGS IN PLOT DEVELOPMENT AND IN GENERl is mediocre at best."
4,one for the money,"Very entertaining. Not as good as the book. Would have liked a bit more chemistry between Ranger and Stephanie, I kept thinking a younger Steven Segal would have been a perfect Ranger Lulu part could have been played up a bit more - definitely not as funny as the books; Stephanie's parents and Grandma were very well cast. Not sure about Joe Morelli - had a different vision of him based on book (dark eyes, etc). Pace was good. Overall, I would watch this movie again. The early books (like the first 12) would make a good TV series; Janet's writing has deteriorated over the last 5 or 6 books."
4,Must laugh,Fun- Good lead in and background for the second in the series - That's when the real fun begins - This was true to the book - Hope they don't stop making movies of the continuing adventures of Stephanie Plum
4,Just like the book,"I love Janet Evanovich's books, so I had to check out this movie. I like Katherine Heigl, but she's not who I think of ""Stephanie"" as, but she did a good job in the movie. All the characters came from the book and the story went along with the book. Not a movie I would watch again, but it was enjoyable the first time around."
2,Diappointing,"One of the great things about Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum stories is they're so funny you actually laugh out loud while reading them. Apparently that doesn't transfer well to the screen. Details from the book that are necessary to understand where the characters are coming from were left out of the movie. When it was over, I kind of felt like ""That's it? That's all we get?"""
3,Not a film for the whole family as advertised,"The description for the movie on the ""watch trailer"" page describes this movie as for the whole family. The most obvious reason this is not for children is the amount of violence, both mortal wounds and violence against women. While not visually showing the following, the script and plot refer to adultery and fornication and morbid subjects. Cuss words abound. Protect your kids."
4,Even gooder with someone to talk with.,A lot of conversation points to think about. Even good for the teenagers in the house. Both my wife and I enjoyed it.
3,Books are better,"I love love love the Stephanie Plum series, but the casting for this movie stinks. Katharine Heigl is flat out boring as Stephanie Plum, and Debbie Reynolds doesn't do Grandma Mazur justice. The best actress for her character was Sherri Shephard. This is one of those cases where I didn't think I'd like the movie before I saw it, but I knew I had to see it anyway to see how bad it really was. Believe me, it was awful. Hopefully, Janet will keep cranking out the hilariously outrageous books, but no more movies.....please!!"
2,"Movie OK, could have been better....","The movie was OK. The movie could have followed the book more closely (more humor in book) The casting could have been better for Grandma & Ranger. Sorry that I purchased the movie. I should have waited for Netflix. On the good side, Amazon delivered the movie on the release date."
4,Better than expected,"I had read some of the previous reviews of this DVD which were very negative, particularly regarding the casting, and, as a big fan of Janet Evanovich/Stephanie Plum, I wasn't sure whether or not it would be worth it. I actually found the movie enjoyable and look forward to more DVD adaptations in the future. Ranger was the only semi-disappointment, as he wasn't dangerous or mysterious enough."
1,Why does Hollywood keep doing this to books?!,Did anyone involved in this movie even read the book? I doubt it. *sigh* Just read Booklover848's review he/she covered it all.
5,This was a great movie.,My movie was sent in a timely fashion and it was at a reasonable price. Will use this service again.
3,Looked interesting,Previews were better than this movie. I was kind of lost with the back story and this was way to far of a reach for her to play this part.
3,Funny Movie,I light and funny movie. Nothing serious here. Not quite as funny as the book but still fun. Katherine Heigl is sexey..
2,Barely Watchable,"If you're looking for something utterly mindless, this movie could be a viable option. Otherwise, it should be avoided. Paltry dialogue and plot. Fairly shoddy acting as well."
5,Entertaining ...,"Clever, funny, not as predictable as I thought it was going to be. More of a storyline than say ""Bounty Hunter""."
1,Retarded,"What was Heigl thinking? This flick was awful. Her accent was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, and money was wasted. I can't believe Sherri Shepherd fought to be in this movie -- as a street hooker!!! What is wrong with her? Don't waste your time with this."
3,Mildly amusing,"A silly rom-com, not as funny as the book but easy to watch. The casting was fine -- Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur was especially fun -- with the exception of Daniel Sunjata as Ranger. As a fan of the books, I need someone smoother and more inscrutable to portray Ranger. Overall, this was a pleasant enough way to spend 90 minutes."
4,Never read the books but might now,"This movie was very entertaining. They kept a good cat and mouse throughout the movie. The acting was good, the suspense was enough to keep you going throughout the entire film and it was wrapped up nicely at the end. I liked the fact that they were able to add humor to elements of seriousness. It was a good film. There were probably some unrealistic elements, but for the most part the film was believable enough to be able to suspend my disbelief for it. I also liked that despite the humor of the film, it was able to talk about and discuss crime in a somewhat serious manner. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and liked it more than I expected to. As I said, I may check out the books after watching it."
3,Average at best,Not the best Katherine Heigl movie - the story line was predictible. A few decent parts but not worth your time.
1,Not worth reviewing,"This movie was not worth watching, neither reviewing. I shut it off early. It was a poorly written nad creafted movie."
3,so so,"amusing light comedy, no substnce,kind of like a frozen dinner. ingredients are there, its just the way they are put together"
4,One for the Money,I have read the books and although the movie did not go by the book it was stillfun to watch. I laugh at a Irishman playing an Itialian. Still the movis was good
2,A travesty of Trenton - A Terribly Directed,"I am a native of Trenton, and I gave up on this movie halfway through. It has no allegiance to Chambersburg, where the novels are set, and has no idea how people from Trenton speak. They all sound like New Yorkers, which is never the case. Aside all that, Kathryn Heigl is poorly cast, as is Debbie Reynolds, and indeed the rest of the cast. I've seen television episodes better directed and shot like this bore fest."
2,nah,"pretty predictable. if you're into really basic and predictable plots, this ones for you! Maybe the book was better? But i feel bad for the author."
3,It was an OK movie,This movie was not a 5 star but was ok.I like K.Heigl but she is not really very funny in this movie.
3,Good afternoon watch,"The movie was alright. Enjoyable, low key and comical. Definitely worth a rental, but not a purchase. The plot was simple, acting okay, and story line somewhat believable. Now, I am interested in reading the book."
3,Okay,I love all the books in the series and the audio books are really great. The movie was from the first book so too old when it came out and the Ranger character was not as hot as the book says he is.
2,review,"It's entertaiing, I was expecting it'd be more fun. Overall it was not bad. I have watched better movies from her"
3,Read the book,All I can say is read the book... The movie was okay but failed to capture the feel and humor of the books!
3,One for the Money,"While the streaming of the video was excellent, the movie was fair. Had read the book, and watched the movie in sections, so that may have influenced my rating the movie as only fair. But still well worth it for fans of the book. Stayed true to the story."
1,Lame,"I would say don't waste your money, but actually it's your time I'm worried about. It's 90 minutes you'll never get back."
2,"Good adaptation of the book, but not very interesting.",The book was simple and so was the movie. If you loved the book you'll like the movie. I thought the book was fair and so was the movie.
1,Forgettable,"I wish I could list all the reasons why this movie is so forgettable such as a not believable, told before storyline with bland acting and directing/editing that belonged in the made-for-tv mode. But, even though I watched it three days ago, I can't remember the movie. I did watch ""Few Options"" the day before it and ""Miss Bala"" the day before that and I do remember them. Oh well!"
1,Don't bother,"Don't ruin the visual you created from reading the books with watching this movie. The movie actor/actresses just don't do the books' justice. Someone should have looked a LOT closer at the selection of who played Staphanie, Ranger, Grandma Mazur...well, actually the whole cast. Really...so sorry I watched this - now I have this sad visual of the book characters.Stick to the books."
3,One for the Money,this movie was cute but not nearly as funny as the book. See the movie first then read the book!
2,One for the Money,The story line was pretty good though the acting left a lot to be desired. The relationships of some of the characters were not realistic. The movie was overall mediocre!
2,ONE FOR THE MONEY,THIS MOVIE WAS OK BUT LACKED THE HUMOR THAT THE BOOKS HAVE WHICH IS WHAT MAKED THE BOOKS GOOD THE GUYS CAST IN THESE ROLES WERE BADLY MISCAST.THIS COULD NOT REALLY BE TYPED AS A COMEDY OR ADVENTUES MOVIE .
2,Slow,While the movie was true to the book it did not translate to the screen. The movie seems to lumber along and never catches the audience.
2,one for the money,The book by janet evanovich is ten times better but the movie was still decent I expected the actors to portray their character better.
3,Just OK,The movie was fun to watch but disapointing after reading the Stephanie Plum books. The books were much better. There are two many characters and not enough time to realize their parts.
2,One for the Money,The series in books is very well written. So much so that the characters are vivid in your mind. The casting is way off in this movie. Several of my friends and I watched it and we all felt the same.
2,I'm from Trenton...No Way!,"I don't think even one shot (except the beginning where they show the Trenton Makes bridge) was actually from Trenton, NJ. They also gave all of the characters a ""North Jersey"" accent and look. Trenton is decidedly ""South Jersey"" and has its own dialect, similar to a Philadelphia and not New York accent.With all of that said Heigl is of course super hot but the rest of the movie is lacking, and most of the comedy was left in the book. (Pretty good read)They had a scene in a shooting range with assault rifles painted on the outside, a real laugher. One, there is no shooting range anywhere near Trenton and assault type rifles have been illegal here since the 80's.Pros:Heigl is 5'9"" and gorgeous.Cons:Everything else."
3,This was okay,This was okay. It wasn't horribly bad but it wasn't great. It seemed like the funny parts were all displayed in the trailer. :-s
1,so bad dont even remember it,"and I think we turned it off along the way. its amazing the stupid movies that are coming out these days.its no surprise why good TV shows like Breaking Bad, Homeland are beating movies. Its called character development and having a story to tell."
1,One Star for the Unsinkable Debbie Reynolds,"Janet Evanovich's 1994 bestseller gets thoroughly trashed in this dreadful film adaptation. The only redeeming feature in ""One for the Money"" (2012) is Debbie Reynolds' lively presence as Grandma Mazur. Further proof that Katherine Heigl wants to overtake Jennifer Aniston as the Queen of Bad Cinema."
3,Felt like the feature length Pilot of a T.V. series,"The film feels like it would have been better adapted as a series instead of a film. The ending especially has the impact of the end of a weekly episode and not a satisfying conclusion to a self contained comedy/romance/ adventure or whatever genre the movie was trying to be.The movie fails to really fit into any of its genres. It's not funny enough to be called a comedy, the romance is barely there and the action and adventure are more timid than almost anything on television.The performances however are all good. As someone who never understood the appeal of Katherine Heigl she was surprisingly enjoyable.All in all it's not a horrible film. I would recommend against buying it, more something for a late Sunday afternoon when it comes on cable. It's enjoyable to sit through but it's not one I can ever see myself wanting to watch a second time.I give ""One for the Money"" a very mediocre 3 out of 5"
3,Not Heigl's Best,"The movie was only okay and that was due in large part to the non-stellar performance of Heigl. I expected better from her, but this just seemed like bad acting all around."
3,You probably have to be a fan of the series to love this movie,"Love the series so I enjoyed seeing the characters come to life. Katherine Heigl is a good Stephanie and the other characters were pretty good too. However, if you have not read the book you may not be charmed by the movie."
4,One For The Money,"Good movie, not boring, but not spectacular. It does have Katherine Heigl who is easy on the eyes. I have certainly seen worse movies."
4,Entertaining,"Came across this movie while bored at work. First, Katherine Heigl looks of in his movie. It was entertaining. Killed a good amount of work time."
3,One Thought,It was cute.I liked Debbie Reynolds as the grandmother. I have enjoyed the books for a light read. It was entertaining
4,Good Story,Good story well played. Good chemistry between the actors. Funny in parts. Definitley worth your time to watch this movier!
3,Bad streaming? Storm Related?,"The movie is good, funny and entertaining.Seems that Amazon streaming has been slow of the past few days. Lots of pauses and delays/skips while watching as the viedo loaded. Checked all internal systems and no issues, maybe the storm noth of us caused issues."
4,Really Fun Movie,"I have read all 18 Stephanie Plum books and was so excited when the movie came out. If you are a fan of the Plum books, you've got to see this! Great movie for a great price!"
2,Outacted by a...Hamster!,"It's true. The hamster who played Rex is the best actor in this film.Janet Evanovich is one of my all-time favorite authors, and I couldn't wait to see her books adapted to film. When I heard Katherine Heigl would be playing Stephanie, I cried...and they weren't tears of joy. There are so many talented actors who could have done Stephanie justice. Why couldn't one of them be cast in this role?I liked Sherri Shepherd as Lula and Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur, but beyond that, well, I'll just say I'm glad we rented this movie instead of buying it!"
4,entertaining,very cute movie. It was entertaining and enjoyable a movie that could be watched with your family. I really enjoyed it
1,"Terrible, only for Heigl watching","Only finished watching this movie because we had nothing else to watch and helped to put us to sleep. Just for someone who wants to watch Heigl,"
5,Another fun movie.,cheesy chick flick but entertaining. would recommend it if your bored on a lazy weekend. i seem to remember another movie like this with jen anniston.
3,It's OKay,I've enjoyed Katherine Heigl in other movies but shes not how I envision Stephanie Plum. The books are more fun. I am not certain how I'd feel if I hadn't read the books.
3,Good acting,"Not a bad film, however I think its geared for a younger audience. I'm at an age where I'm not so easily entertained and demand a little more meat on a story line than this one offered to this audience."
3,It's just OK.,"Well, streamed for free, so it's relative. Glad we didn't go pluck down money at the theater to see it."
3,It was a cute movie,fun watching the character develope her character. It is a cute movie with fun twists. The nude scene was distastful and not needed.
4,very enjoyable,fun movie. I have read all her books so was curious about the casting. Heigl was great as Stephanie good plot..
3,movie review,This was alright. I love the Stephanie Plum books. The book was much better than the movie. I laughed a lot more while reading the bood with the pictures that formed in my head.
2,Somewhat entertaining but not enough entertaining,Maybe Katherine Heigl was the wrong lead actress for this movie. It just wasn't that entertaining. I don't recommend it.
3,Okay,"This movie was okay. Not fabulous, not awful. I didn't enjoy it as much as the books. Not as funny and the fake Jersey accents were brutal."
2,Plum Disappointed,"When I heard Kathryn Hiegel had been cast in this ""plum"" role, I couldn't see it. I know all those of us who are faithful fans from the first book all have pictures in our minds of what the character look like. I can say with certainty that no Stephanie Plum fan pictured Hiegel in the role. I was disappointed in all the casting because I like what I see in my mine's eye. I was so afraid the movie would make me toss all my books. Fortunately it didn't. I found that after time, Stephanie, Joe, Ranger, Lula were all back just the way I imagined them. Thank goodness the movie didn't ruin it for me, but I fear the effect the movie has had on the ""unPlumed."" I hope there will be no further attempts at taking these wonderful books & ruining them in film.I am currently reading ""Notorious Nineteen"" & am glad to have Stephanie, Grandma Mazur, Morelli, Ranger & Lula back where they belong."
4,Very cute movie.,"I have never read the books, but I was determined to watch this movie anyway. Can I just say that I love the cast? John Leguiziamo is so hilarious. Although he played a serious character in this role. I loved Stephanie's commentary and her naivety. She was so adorable! Ranger was totally awesome! Now, Joey was hilarious, too. I would have liked to get a little more back-story on his and Stephanie's relationship. I love their banter and the insults. I may have to read The actual book series if it has as much wit and sarcasm as this movie. I really liked it. It was really more of a mystery flick than an action or romance flick. And the ending was pretty cute, too."
4,"Great flick, action, humor ...","Thought the previews looked good but you just never know. A good movie with some action, humor and maybe a hint of romance...really like the attitude of detective Plum. Definitely worth watching"
3,this is the movie I have on in the background when I paint my nails,"I liked the books (ok, I've only read the first three...) and I've been wanting to see the movie for the LONGEST time and finally the price on Instant Video was reduced 9 bucks. Ugh. Still - I only got this because I got amazon gift cards. I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone who hasn't read the book (or else he/she will be supremely bored).Overall, it delivers and I was entertained. This movie makes me miss John Leguizamo a lot. He needs to be in more movies."
3,Wow.....I was very disappointed with the language.....,"I love the Stephanie Plum series. I wanted to see the movie so bad..... I did and was seriously disappointed at how many time the ""GD"" word was used. I know there is the occasional in the series but that was a little ridiculous."
2,Pretty ordinary.,"A woman who is unemployed and generally down on her luck tries her hand at bounty hunting, and the primary target turns out to be an ex-lover of hers. She gets involved in mischief and tries to survive while bringing in the bounty. This is an attempt at being clever, funny and hip, but the movie achieves none of those. The storyline is only mildly interesting, and the film has complimentary characters meant to provide light moments, but they are not very funny. I like Katherine Heigl, and she does her best with this, but the material is lacking, and this turns out to be an unrealized attempt at clever comedy."
1,One-day access did not allow me to finish watching,"I probably would have enjoyed this movie had I seen more than 20 minutes of it. Since your policy allows only 24 hours access, I did not have a chance to see most of it."
1,Snoozer,"I don't read the books so I have no reason to be offended by the book-to-film transfer. I just thought it was not witty, not even funny, not charming, not sexy and not worth my $3.99 rental. I have never like one thing Heigl has done however, so what was I thinking?"
5,LOVED IT,"I ENJOYED THE MOVIE FROM BEGINNING TO END. VERY ENJOYABLE. HAPPY, LAUGHABLE, LOVEABLE AND MORE. YOU'LL ENJOY WATCHING THIS MOVIE."
2,very dissapointing,"This was a free movie through prime, glad I never spent money to watch this. I like Heigel but this piece of carp was just a waste of time. Poor acting and worse plot lines say Beware of wasting valuable time.we"
3,Watch if you haven't read the book,I'm sure this would be a great movie if I hadn't read ALL the books. Grammy needs to be funnier and there's no where enough almost bad language
2,major disappointment,"The books are clever even though you know the circumstances are unlikely. Having read all the books, I was looking forward to the movie but I turned it off before the end because I was so turned off by the ridiculousness of the adaptation."
3,2nd time viewing,"saw previously in the theater and enjoyed it, decided to look at when available on dvd, and saw why the critics not enthused about the movie, it was a good introduction to the characters, lots of one liners that were funny, and I thought they were good choices for the parts. But was too light in the development of the story, this is were the book shines."
3,ok movie,"nothing special. nothing horrible. it was just an OK movie to watch when you having nothing else to watch or do. kinda reminds me of the summer movies when I was growing up before the ""blockbuster"" phenom came and went. I have no idea what these other reviewers are talking about when they mention a book as I didn' tknow it was based upon a book. But I hardly think the subject matter could be funny."
3,She wasn't bad. Jason O'Mara was yummy,"The only reason I saw this was because I like Jason O'Mara. I read a few of this series in high school, so I was familiar with the character, and I have to say it wasn't bad. He was very good--and he took his shirt of YUM! Katherine Hiegl(sp?) was fine, she did not irritate me, which was a plus. I don't need to own it but I could watch it again."
4,"I expected a turd, but it wasn't bad","When I first heard that Katherine Heigl was playing Stephanie Plum, I groaned. I did not think she could pull it off. But she was actually pretty good. This isn't an epic film, but it's fun and follows the book fairly well. Some of the scenes are a bit cheesy, but not as bad as I expected. The special features are fairly lame. I think a commentary track would have been nice for the fans of the book, perhaps including the author. All in all, I was expecting a really, really bad movie, but was pleasantly surprised."
2,Not worth the money,Reynolds playing grandma is like Cruise playing Reacher. If it would have followed the book you would have had a money maker. Now I'm not sure I will follow the books.
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"First a story for a movie requires a begining, second a middle and third an ending. A good production of the story is also necessary."
3,one for the money,"If I had not read the book I would have thought this was just a ""cutsie"" comedy. While the overall story follows the book some of the book's more hillareous adventures were omitted. All in all it was average"
4,Entertaining pure Stephanie Plum,"Funny, suspenseful and mystery. Oh and hot,the guys that is Morelli and Ranger :). Not as good as the books they r a must read and the movie well at putting the book into picture."
4,very funny,"One For The Money is the movie of the best-selling novel of the same title by Janet Evanovich. While some changes have been made from the novel to adapt to the screen, the essence of the book, the atmosphere and characters are true to the book. It is well acted, although I really pictured Joe Morelli as taller and more handsome, and while Debbie Reynolds did an adequate job, in my mind Grandma Mazur was Estelle Getty reprising her role from the Golden Girls. Plenty of laugh out loud moments."
3,Thoughtless Entertainment,"Good movie if you want sheer entertainment and nothing thought provoking. Typical female bounty hunter plot. Worth the rental fee, but only need to watch this movie one time."
4,I liked it....it is what it is,"I really enjoyed this movie. It is what is is...doesn't require deep thought, doesn't keep you up at night, doesn't require you to watch it a 2nd time to understand the characters. It's entertaining. I agree with another reviewer who said some of the funny parts of the book were left out, and they should have been included. Danny DeVito would have been a great Vinnie! If more of the Stephanie Plum books are produced as movies, I will watch them also. I'm reading the series for the 2nd time, and it's a hoot!"
4,Jersey Girl delivers,It was great to see all the characters I have been reading about come to life. It was a delight to see the names now have faces and what good looking faces at that. The cast makes the pages from the book come alive. Can't wait for the second book to be made into a movie. i will be a fan forever.
3,Cute,I rented this as a preview had me chuckling and it was good to see the actor from Life on Mars (American) in another role.
3,Cute Movie,"Cute movie that kept my attention, was fast paced and fun. I have not read any of the books from this series which is probably a good thing, those who have read the books told me the movie wasn't as good - but they never are. I love Katherine Heigl she is a great comedic actress who just makes you want to laugh with her."
2,Really bad.,Poor plot. Not funny ... when you expect funnier movie from Katherine Heigl.The whole thing is overall weak. Not worth seing.
2,Wish I hadn't bought the DVD,"I am a fan of the books, so that might be the problem, but I found the movie boring. I didn't laugh once. I just didn't care. Definitely not worth the money I paid for it. Rent it; don't buy it."
2,Book vs. Movie,UPDATED:I am NJ native who has read and enjoyed (most)of the book series.The movie was disappointing. It was missing the wit and humor from the books. I didn't care for the poor NJ accents and there was too much deviation from the book plotline.
2,Disappointed,"Even though I read the reviews prior to ordering the DVD - I still ordered it, silly me. I really wanted this to be good but it just wasn't. The casting was just way off and Stephanie would never run around in a skirt. I literally laughed out loud when I first read the book but didn't find the movie funny at all, I actually fell asleep at one point.If there is a Two for the Dough - PLEASE reconsider the casting and the script."
1,Amazon Stars? Useless.,"This movie has been panned by nearly every critic who has watched it (what movie exactly did you see Scott Nash? [...]), and has an amazingly awful rotten tomatoes score of 2% fresh. Yet, Amazon users have given it 3 1/2 stars, which is the SAME RATING as Crash - BEST PICTURE 2005, No Country for Old Men - BEST PICTURE 2007. That is 1/2 star BETTER THAN The Hurt Locker and The King's Speech - BEST PICTURE 2009 and 2010, respectively.Seriously?I don't care that these are user-generated reviews and the average watcher shouldn't be held to the same standard and Roger Ebert. AMAZON STARS ARE UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY USELESS and should be SCRAPPED."
1,Will stick to the books....,"I felt the only 3 who were fine for the parts were Stephanie, Joe, and Connie. I would have never known any of the others without their names. ""Ranger"" looked like my brother when he was 11, and he was not sexy.I would recommend you watch it and form your own review and thoughts on it. I did not think it followed the book well.Janet Evanovich could have really made it great if she had done the casting and script."
1,Awful!,"The book was great! The movie was one of the worst I've seen lately. It reminded me of some people getting together over a weekend and deciding to make a movie. There was absolutely nothing good about this movie, I'm glad I only wasted a dollar at the dollar theater to see it."
3,Done before - kinda ok,This movie is just OK. Didn't hate this movie but it was just OK - you've seen it before any number of times. The main character was never really developed. What it is and what it could have been - opportunity missed.
2,One for the Money,"Once the movie actually started, it was actually quite good - followed the book very well. However, getting to that point was a pain. Must have had to sit through 10 previews before the movie started. I'm guessing this was a rental because of all the previews. I would like the ads to state that, it's worth paying a couple of dollars more to get a ""clean"" movie."
2,Disappointed,"I watched this movie thinking I would like it because I like most all of Katherine Heigel's other movies but I was pretty disappointed with this one. Bad accents, boring story line, and everything else pretty much made this movie a bust. The trailer for the movie looked more interesting than the actual movie itself."
3,One is For YOUR Money,"Catherine Heigel is not my first choice for Stephanie Plum, and they definitely needed to make the movie funnier. All in all, though, it was entertaining, and we will watch again soon. Great choice for Morelli and actually Lula. Ranger ? not so much. If they go for a series, they need to definitely work on humor and make it physical humor, like the book."
3,The book was so good,"I loved the book ""One For The Money"" and I was sure the movie couldn't compare but I didn't expect it to so totally miss the mark. Where was the humor?? Katheryn Heigel was better than I expected but not much. Sherry Shepard is so funny you would have thought she would have been given more dialogue and what she did have wasn't funny. Grandma Mazur's main activity is going to the funeral viewings and that wasn't even there. It just really came up missing!!!!! Don't judge your reading choises on this movie, the books are so much better!!!!!!!!"
1,Save your money and read the books instead,"I am a huge fan of Evanovich. I laughed so hard when I started reading the series that I was crying...the only reason I was crying when I watched this movie was because it was so painful and confusing as to how they could have taken such a great and funny book and ruined it to such a degree. If you have the unfortunate luck to watch the movie before you read the book, don't despair...they have very little in common."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,I am a huge Katherine Heigl. This one is not her typical movie and lacks the goofy-comedy that she is known for.
3,A fun film to watch,"I like Katherine Heigl as an actress. This film shows good chemistry between her and the male lead. Their characters still have the hots for one another, and her character is good at dishing back what she receives. It's more of a romantic comedy than a mystery. This movie did cause me to purchase the book, and I can see how the relationship develops in the series (I now have book 2 of the Stephanie Plum series). It's not an award winning film, but if it is a day that rainy or you're just wanting a quiet day then watch the film."
2,Boring,This movie was so boring. My wife even thought this one sucked. I would stay away from this one if you can.
2,Loved the book,Well like the title says I loved the book. I thought Heigl was less than not right for the roll she was flat out wrong for it. There were things that i thought should have been focused on from the book that could have added alot but were cut out. I thought the casting choice for Ranger was all wrong as well. I thought the guy who played Joe did a good job. Not the right physical description but the right attitude. Heigle did what she does with all her roles she turned plum into a high strung obnoxious person with a really bad jersey accent. Plum is supposed to be goofy and accident prone not high strung and annoying.
2,One for the Money,Stick with the books. They are soooooo much better. I don't feel the right actors were chosen for the parts.
3,One For The Money,"My sister and I are both huge fans of Janet Evanovich and the Stephanie Plum series so the movie proved to be somewhat disappointing. They should have followed the book much closer to do it the most justice and even though I liked Katherine Heigl as Stephanie, the men that played Morelli and Ranger were not at all as I envisioned them. However when the DVD comes out I will buy it but I hope in the future that Janet Evanovich will be a little more strict and attentive regarding the script as J.K. Rowling was in the Harry Potter movies."
1,Horrible,"Just from the previews I didn't think it would be worth paying the rental fee. I was right. I waited until it showed up on Netflix. I made it through twenty minutes and turned it off. No one in the roles made sense. From the terrible Jersey accents to the non-Italian actors, it was a disaster. I don't know what the casting director was thinking when they put this group of actors together to make this movie. Not one of them fit their part. Do not waste your time on this mess. If they had found all new actors that fit the parts, and had written a decent script it would have been a funny and enjoyable movie."
4,Enjoyable!,"I went into this movie not knowing fully what it was really all about. It was one my wife wanted to read, as she had read some of the books, and she checked it out and we watched it on one of our stay in date nights. I found it actually rather enjoyable. The actors were good in it and there was some good humor in it. Aside from comedy, I am also big into action & thriller movies, so those bits in the movie were up my alley too. I'd recommend to just about anyone to give this a watch...it's pretty good."
3,One for the Money,"This movie got horrible ratings on Rotten Tomatoes, lowest I've ever seen, so didn't go see it in the theater. I can see why the critics didn't like it and why the audience gave it low ratings. It was ok but missing the laugh out loud humor of the books. The books are great and the movie could be too if they stuck more to the book. Grandma Mazur is a hoot, but wasn't in the movie. Some books don't make good movies and maybe Stephanie Plum's adventures fall in that category."
5,"At last, the movie!!","If you've read the book, now you can watch the movie. Very entertaining. Fun to watch more than once. The movie was delivered on time and in excellent condition. Would deal with this seller again."
3,Not something you NEED to see BUT not bad if your watching it.,Katherine Heigl was okay.Everyone else in the film was okay.I felt like other characters would have been better developed and the humor and intensity could have been better when needed but its just one of those movies you dont feel like you wasted time on because you find yourself slightly amused...however for Katherine Heigl's acting skill it was probably her worst role to date. I could see a no name actress making this movie into something but heigl may have brought the audience but trust me it failed to hold.The plot was okay-Could have been better just like the acting but not at all the worst thing you'll ever sit through.If your expecting Heigl to bring it...Dont! you'll might enjoy it better that way.
4,Enjoyed One For the Money!,"Nice, fun movie. Good for a night of not wanting to think about anything and just enjoy a light movie."
3,A little slow....,"But I could watch Katherine Heigl walking, talking or just breathing. She is so dang cute. Still worth watching, has some funny moments."
2,One for the money,The characters aren't at all what I imagined. The story wasn't as good as the book. Debbie Reynolds isn't gradma Masur.
1,one for the record books,I knew Heigle would suck but I had no idea the casting of the men would be so wrong too! I couldn't sit through it. The book had such great potential as a cute movie but this movie really failed.
3,More Violence than I expected,"This was listed as a comedy, and it did have some really good laughs in it. However, I was surprised at the amount of violence there was. It came unexpectedly. I suppose that is ""good drama,"" but when you are just looking for a good movie to relax with, it kind of spoiled the experience."
4,lighthearted fun,"Being a big fan of Janet evanovich, I liked this movie. There is definitely room for improvement with the actors chosen and hopefully they will make more of these books into movies. Seeing how the books only got better and better as the reader gets to know the characters more, I can only imagine the movies would get better. At the end of the day, I still enjoyed this movie and would watch it again."
1,Buyer Beware!!!!!,"This is the worst appliance I have ever purchased. The toaster stinks, the ovgen is inconsistent, and after five months completely died- The advice from B & D was to buy another one. Evidently this happens all of the time. I will buy another, but it certainly won't be Black and Decker!!!!!!!!!"
1,FIRESTARTER!,"We were reasonably happy with this toaster oven; although it didn't toast well or evenly, the glass gets very dirty, it gets very hot and the heating element coils catch on fire frequently. We were willing to settle for this less than stellar functionality until this morning when toasting some hash brown patties. All of a sudden there were sparks flying out of either end of the toaster oven (literally sparks of fire shooting all over the kitchen counter and toward me) and then before you know it the unit was on fire inside. Thankfully we were able to unplug it before there was any real damage; no damaged kitchen cabinets and no kitchen fire - but if we had left the kitchen for a minute, our kitchen could have caught on fire. This is the second TRO651 that we purchased, and the second one to bite the dust! I will definitely buy another toaster oven, but I will definitely NOT buy another Black and Decker."
1,2 days is all I got this product working,"I bought this product for my wife who is pregnant. It was a big dissapointment, after the second time that we were using it, the thing stopped working. I will try a refund"
2,Junk,Bought mine at MENARDS April 2009 It quit working this month 10/2010 only has 1 year warranty.Black & Decker has been going down hill with the quality of products for sometime.It was made in China. I'm going to get a Hamilton Beach.
3,Documentation around a museum exhibition,"This book is a collection of photographs and some background text of an exhibition of the same title. The photographs are good. The information behind them is academic and dry. So beyond getting the book for some interesting photographs you would not need to including this book in things related to either Tiwanaku or the Inca. In fact the book makes a tepid case of this link between Tiwanaku and the Inca. The Inca themselves identified with this area and claimed (as the current conquerors) the divine descendency from the Tiwanaku. But the Inca also strongly inherited their culture from the Wari, Moche, Chavin, and others.If you are interested in Tiwanaku then 'the' prime resource isAncient Tiwanaku (Case Studies in Early Societies)."
4,Modify Speedloader,"This speed loader did rub against the grip, but I simply ground & filed down one side (where the outer edge hit on the grip), & now it loads easily. I painted the upper side by the knob yellow so I can immediately see which edge to fit toward the grip. I imagine you could just file down all the thick parts of the edge so you could use it any direction."
5,Works nice with the Taurus 441,"I bought this speed loader for my Taurus 441, and it works great. At first I thought it might be cheap because it's made out of plastic, but it seems to be really durable. Has a nice smooth action to allow one to reload quickly. The Taurus is my home defense gun so I wouldn't give this item a good review or use the item if I didn't believe this product worked well."
4,Great Charlie Parker intro,"I know a lot of jazz fans dont like Clint Eastwood film on Charlie Parker. I see some flaws, but generally like, it was really a labor of love.I never cared to get the soundtrack. Again, most reviews were negative: Bird solos copied and pasted over new recordings. Most Bird fans thought of it as sacrilege.Well, I finally stumbled across a cheap copy at my used CD store, and since I could not find anything else, I grabbed. Am I glad I did. I had not played Charlie Parker music in a while and this is quite good, I cant stop playing it. Live and studio, classic solos and obscure ones, really really diggin it."
4,Review of Zoo by Gail Gibbons,"In this book, Gibbons includes all important facts about the zoo presenting the information clearly and directly. The organization of the text is sequential from early morning at the zoo until nightfall. The purpose of the book is portrayed through the text and illustrations. The bright, colorful illustrations compliment the text and are clearly labeled using appropriate vocabulary for the intended age level. The book is very appropriate for young readers and would be a valuable resource for learning about the zoo."
3,"Good, but...","Would love to know what the difference between this album and the one titled 'Trojan Ska Revival' on the Trojan/Sanctuary label is? It says that the other set is remastered, so why is it so much cheaper? Would also love to know the connection between Trojan and Two Tone Records?Anyone who was around at the time of this boom will love this collection. It brings together the main players and their hits, minus Madness, who strangely appear on another Trojan recent release. Nearly all the tracks are live and are of better quality than the few studio recorded classics. What is with that `hiss'? It's 2004, CDs have been out for nearly a quarter of a century and were supposed to improve sound quality, but we are instead treated to `hiss' on digital equipment. And these record companies complain that their profits are down."
5,Long-Remembered,"My boys were probably around the 11 to 13 year old range when we listened to this book on tape. The musical cadence of the author's dialect, and the strange words and ghastly images, like ""Fifolet"" & ""Rawhead"" fascinated us, and still occasionally surface in my memory.The tape was heard once, returned to the library, and that was that...except that last night my now 21-year-old son called me from college to ask what the name of that tape was with the ""Fifolet"", etc. on it! I asked if he needed it for some project, and he said, no, he just thought it was cool and wanted to hear it again!So there you go for a recommendation. That a kid would remember for almost a decade a once-heard, barely-an-hour-long tape, and want to hear it again. Without really knowing the title or author, I did manage to find it, so he will be delighted!"
2,It was Okay - That's the best I could do...Just Okay,"I agree with a previous reviewer who stated ""It was too basic...this is stuff any college kid would know."" However, that being said, one can't just start in the middle of a topic and write a book. I thought it was more like reading a business cards for dummies edition type book. If you are new and starting out in the business world and never owned a business card, then you should probably read this. Not to say I didn't find a few useful tips, but this book certainly hasn't turned my business upside down or changed my life as the editiorial reviews would lead you to believe. Those reviews were probably written by close friends and family.I walk away from this glad I didnt pay full price and got free shipping on the book."
1,First book I am returning,"This is the first book out of many I have purchased at Amazon.com that I will be returning. I expected much more out of a book that is rated 5 stars by the seven reviewers before me.Here's what I really wanted - tips on card design with statistics on what works and what doesn't. For example - what to put where on the card and perhaps some test marketing and statistics to show what information is important on a card and what should be left off.Then I wanted a rational scientific approach to networking with the card - with an evaluation of effectiveness of approaches depending on the situation.Instead what I read was a few gladhanding techniques - none of which were new to me.Get the book if you are absolutely brand new to business and you have no idea on how to use your business cards. Otherwise, I recommend a pass."
4,Cheap Marketing Tips,"I liked this book. Not a large book and certainly easy to read. Not every tip is right for me but the few I did like, really make sense. Interesting book...a book that the author should update."
3,Point Taken,I found all kinds of interesting tips on designing a new business card. These are mostly no brainers...ie... be proud of it! When meeting people...do they really want your card...will they use it?...do you follow up with them when they have taken it...easy stuff...It is an easy read. I read it in 2 short evenings and will use it for reference.
5,very happy with this book,"i found this book at barnes and noble for less than 10 bucks. it has great pictures of dozens and dozens of poses. i'm just developing an interest in yoga and this book is one that i can use now as a beginner and at the same time it will grow with me as i improve. it has six different routines that get progressively more challenging which is exactly what i was looking for. i've rented books from the library on different yoga poses but the more i studied these types of books the more overwhelmed i became. what i really needed was some routines to get me started. so i was very excited when i stumbled across the yoga directory. if you're new to yoga, i say go for it. it's even cheaper on amazon. you won't be sorry."
1,Nothing but emotions,"This book is different than most young earth books. It is mostly a heartfelt emotional appeal to young earth creationists not to abandon ship. It contains little scientific facts, and the ones it does contain were disproven years ago. The author relies on evidence from questionable creationists, who are even described by the main young earth ministries as lone guns.If you are looking for a scientific explanation of creation, this is not it. If you are trying to decide which version of creation is correct (old, young), this is not for you. The intended audience is young earth creationists who may be thinking of giving up the young earth view. It fails to give any evidence for people to remain young earth. For a full review of this book, see www.answersincreation.org/attack.htm."
1,why is this not released in the U.S.??????? But theres a spain version? REALLY??,"A Spain version? Why???????? really. Where is the U.S version. Will it ever be released????? A 5 star review for the movie, A 1 star on its Import Spain version. BOOOOOOOO."
4,Trash kindled into inferno by Bette Davis,"This is the much-maligned King Vidor film from 1949 whose opening line, uttered by Davis as Rosa Moline, is ""What a dump!"" (Edward Albee borrowed it as Martha's opening line in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.) The overheated plot has to do with frustrated passions, adultery and homicide in small-town Wisconsin. Joseph Cotten as Dr. Moline all but vanishes, and David Brian is, well, David Brian (he had but one arrow in his quiver). There are stretches where the only interest lies in gaping at Davis long black wig -- though her excursion to the big bad city is wonderful. But the film's final moments redeem it. Davis, sick with peritonitis from a botched abortion, abuses her Native American maid, gulps gallons of water, slaps on her makeup and finery, and crawls toward a train whose whistle seems to shreik ""Chicago, Chicago!"" It's an eye-popping, over-the-top cinematic Liebestod."
3,Product Changed - Ignore Review,Ignore original review. Product changed but has same name as earlier product that was for an entirely different automotive application.
2,WHAT HAPPEN TO THE SPARKLE,"I am not 100% sure, but at the time of the release of Sparkle, and upon its success, many whom has seen the movie screamed forthe Original Soundtrack. However it was rumored more than oncethat Lonette McGee was signed to a small independent record company at the time, and they would not allow any recordingsto be released without them (record company) obtaining some monatary gains. Curtis Mayfield said no, and Wha-la, Aretha Franklin was chosen to sing on the album. Yes I know she isthe Queen of Soul, but I always thought Original Soundtrack means the Original Songs, people whom sung them, and music exactly as it sounds in the motion picture. Anything else isan re-enactment. I like and R-E-S-P-E-C-T Aretha, but giveme Lonette on this one."
2,Earley form of sampling,"In my opinon they should have released the orignal soundtrack,thats what a lot of us were looking for in Baltimore,we could relate better,also it did not give Irean and the rest of the singers their proper reconition,I think if they had stuck with the orignal,it would have done a lot better, a lot of us did not purchase Aretha's version. still looking for the real orignal soundtrack."
5,The Original Sparkle Soundtrack,I have the original LP much better the remake - Aretha Franklin vocal Curtis Mayfield music and lyrics - need I type anymore
3,Original Artists,"I recently saw this movie again, and I did not realize until I read the reviews here that a Soundtrack featuring the original artists was not available. While I appreciate the talents of both Aretha and Curtis Mayfield, I do not believe this product should be categorized as a soundtrack album. If there are versions of the original songs out there by Irene Cara, Lonette McKee etc., I would appreciate knowing how to purchase those as opposed to this remake album."
4,Beyonce ain't got nothin' on ReRe,This is the soundtrack to one of my all time favorite movies. I cannot bear the fact that a remake was attempted. This is the real deal.
5,Aretha + Curtis = greatness,"Don't let the lack of big hits on this album fool you into thinking that this lacks great material. Songs written by Curtis Mayfield and sung by Aretha Franklin guarantee that this is a stellar album. The ""sound"" is there, the soulful mood prevails, and Aretha's voice soars as usual. Say no more. This album is a criminally underrated jewel in Aretha's catalog."
4,excellent and a half,"I don't need to say what happens when two true heavyweights--not of soul but all music, join forces. Curtis Mayfield produced this Aretha Franklin album in the mid-1970s.With top line production, this does not have the southrern soul grit of Franklin's 60s soul recordings. The sound is logical--Mayfield was the king of smooth northern soul with the Impressions, and took this even further with his solo funk work.On Sparkle, the name of the game can be described by the title. Fantastic horns, beautiful female backup singers; Aretha's voice is buffered wonderfully by the environment Mayfield creates. This production has the polish of a Steely Dan album.Elegant, classy, refined: you have heard a lot of Aretha Franklin, but it's high time you hear her on Sparkle."
3,Sparkle Soundtrack by Aretha Franklin,"I like the Cd o.k. Aretha Franklin is an excellent singer. However, it is disappointing if you are looking for the songs to sound the same as they did in the movie. I felt that should have put the movie version as well as Aretha's version. That way it is a little something for everyone. The music is the exact same, but it is sung completely different."
1,amazingly poor,"As a long-time Buddhist, i can say this is the least Enlightened talk on Zen I've ever encountered. Didn't know who Osho was, but now that I know the scandal (after which he changed his name from Rajneesh). Avoid this."
1,Cute but...,"The slide over the arch/toe section is an elastic material and is too tight. It made my toes look squished, not to mention how it made them feel. Might possibly work if you do not have a high arch. But also seemed cheap-looking and cheaply made to me for a Donal Pliner product."
2,A Shelby Lynne Fan,"I first heard Shelby on country music stations years ago on her album Tough All Over and was very impressed. My tastes in music have changed over the years and I rediscovered her about a year ago. I personally enjoy her newer style now much better, but it was worth purchasing to listen to her roots."
5,I love it!!!!,"Nothing but 100% quallityOne piece machined aluminum with excellent finishAt the time you receive it you notice that this is not an ordinary product It comes in a fabric bag, with instructions.Nothing compares with itand for the performance, I think is a great component, strong very well done, not heavy and not light giving you a lot of cinfidence riding.I think this will last for ever"
1,Misleading Inventory,"I was looking forward to using my new thomson stem, mainly because the 25.4 stems are getting increasingly hard to find, especially at 70mm. I ordered a Thomson 25.4 clamp 70mm length stem from them, about a week ago and not until I entered my ""expected delivery date"" period, was I notified that this product was out of stock. While the fact that I was able to order a product that was out of stock is frustrating, the fact that it took a week to be notified is even more frustrating. I was expecting to be receiving my item this week, not an email that should have been sent 5 days ago...If you're going to order from them, I would verify their stock first, because it does not appear to be up to date."
3,Just OK.,He offers alot of different options but nothing helped me. I guess I was hoping for an instant healing.
4,Good book ... very interesting theories.,"I have a lot of knowledge and some hands on experience in energy healing. Dr. King obviously has a strong background in the healing arts.I fell on some icy steps after I had finished reading the book. I landed rather badly on my hip and had to sit there for a few moments before I could get up. I tried the exercise of repeating the fall (without actually falling) and saying ""Nothing happened ... nothing happened ... nothing happened."" I still ended up with quite a bad bruise and a lot of soreness. It might have been a lot worse if I hadn't done that. I just have no way of knowing for sure."
2,Black Bird = Musta Lindu (in Finnish) = Black Heart,"This album, Varttina's second, is very hard to find, even in the re-issue edition in which I finally found it. I think this is for serious, serious Varttina fans (like me), and for good reason. This album just does not measure up to either their first album, or to their third, ""Oi Dai."" The singing is much like we find on the first album, but I noted on listening to ""Black Bird"" that in some places the instrumentalists were just not together, either not quite on beat or not quite on key. Maybe they had not yet learned to do multiple takes in the studio. The first album is recognizably Varttina, and is full of good singing and enthusiasm. ""Black Bird"" is perhaps too ambitious - a case of growing pains. On ""Oi Dai"" they really get it together, and maybe that is where most people's Varttina collections should start."
1,Too mutch filler!,This book is not very useful. The only think worth mentioning is degreeing the cam. It includes no REAL information on selecting a cam. The important information from this book is also available with a whole lot more in the book:The Step-By-Step Guide to Engine Blueprinting : Practical Methods for Racing and Rebuilding
2,Dissapointing,"The book merely gives you what the title says, nothing on what to do if you want to set your cams for torque or high-end power. If that's what you're after this is not the book."
2,Title is misleading,This book teaches you a lot about the camshaft and it's function in a combustion engine but it doesn't help you at all in selecting the correct camshaft for YOUR engine.
3,decent book,I felt this book was just ok. It is very short and more about cams in general than a guide to selecting them for your application.
3,Camshaft tuning,"Good info. Not as much detail as i thought there was going to be, however i did learn something new."
4,Good Womack Book,"Womack continues the story of Harry James Denton as Harry plunges into the seedy ""adult"" underworld of Nashville in search of a runaway. An interesting story that will hook you from the start and make it hard to put down. If you enjoy a good suspense / mystery, Womack is a great place to start."
3,"Womack's ""Chain of Fools""","Pretty interesting book - if the reader is from Nashville or very familiar with the streets and sites the author uses (I am both.) If not, there is a lot of relatively meaningless detail that could put off some readers. The hero detective's personality is patterned after stereotypical 30's detectives in manner and speech. I found him less than compelling. Overall, an average book with an average plot made interesting for Nashville readers by it's use of familiar streets and locations."
1,not good for the money,there are much better clocks for the same or lower prices...just goto target/giant...
2,get one that have a swivel arm..,the arm does not swivel. Must install high above your head to be out of the way.

5,must have,"if this release is what i guess [not quite sure since there are pretty few details about it], it's probably one of the best music video compilations i've ever seen; can be compared to onedotzero experimental series or notv vj clips compilations.very nice, very inventive, very impressive.my all time favourites are Gonzales ""Take Me To Broadway"" [fantastic fun & drive] and The Avalances ""Frontier Psychiatrist"" [real psycho ::] but nearly every video here is a pearl"
4,Fine reissue by Verve,"A very welcome reissue, highlighted by what was Side 2 of the original 1961 LP. The band heats up on the frenetic J.J. Johnson tune ""Shutterbug,"" but then fires off one of the best versions of ""Round Midnight"" I can remember. Benny Golson's trademark riffs from this era are heard to great effect, and Art Farmer's inventive solo is deeply felt. My personal favorite is ""November Afternoon,"" by Tom McIntosh, the trombonist on the date. The melody alone is memorable enough, but again, Farmer and Golson kept me transfixed. It's also nice to hear Cedar Walton in this setting, as he was primarily associated with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in this period."
1,The worst book ever,"First of all im sorry that i paid the money that i did,im not quite sure if this book was supposed to be fact or fiction. The photos in the book were of very poor quality,and also very hard to follow this alice in wornderland story for it had no direction what so ever. I would not advise anyone to buy this book unless you are an ""yooper""(and everyone knows there a breed of there own)"
3,A disappointment,"I confess I bought this CD to listen to Jerry Garcia jam with Ornette Coleman. There's not much of that on this album, and what there is is pretty weak. And while I am a huge jazz fan, I didn't care much for the style of jazz Ornette was playing at this time. Nice cover art though."
2,Beware - Deceptive Title,"As a biography, this is quite nice -- very detailed, highly readable, lots of photos. A good account of the life of St. Bernadette. From that standpoint I can certainly recommend it. But from the title and the description, I expected it to be comprised entirely of verbatim excerpts from the writings of, and interviews with, St. Bernadette herself, strung together to create a flowing narrative. I was looking for the most complete volume of the visionary's own description of the Lourdes apparitions, and of her subsequent life, in her OWN WORDS. This is anything but that. So apply caution when choosing this book."
5,LOVE THESE PENS!,These pens are great - they are easy to write with and add a lovely flair to cards and letters.
3,Titus,The outer case was in poor condition.The disks were filthy. One looked like something was spilled on it and left.When I cleaned them however they worked.They were ment to be a gift but I feel bad about them.Please explain your profit better and clean your disks for our sakes.It's just gross and insulting.
5,Buy this DVD WUSSY!,"There is a God in heaven, I have been waiting for this show to hit DVD FOREVER! Finally my prayers have been answered and Titus, Tommy,Dave and the curvacious Erin and of course Ken are hitting my DVD player...and in the words of the awesome Ken Titus...""come on now, don't be a wussy!"""
1,still waiting,"I ordered all three seasons of Titus from you about a month and a half ago. I received season three about two weeks ago. However, i have yet to receive seasons 1 and 2. I would have attempted to contact you another way but, i am currently in afghanistan and the internet is not cooperating with me. This is the only method i have to hopefully get your attention. please send me an email at devin.daedelow@afg.usmc.mil if you get this so this matter can be sorted out."
5,Greatest Show Never Seen,"I can't believe how many people never heard of this amazing show. We watched every episode when it was on the air and were so disappointed when they took it off.Christopher Titus takes dark episodes from his life and instead of adopting the ""poor me"" attitude that many people do, he makes it funny. Or as he says, ""Your past is behind you. Get down off the cross, use the wood to build a bridge, and GET OVER IT!""We should all take a lesson from Titus. Life is what you make it.We were amazed when we found it on DVD and immediately bought it. If you have never seen this great show, you don't know what you are missing."
5,Side-splitting Funny; Not for the Deaf,"One of the best TV shows ever made... unfortunately axed in its prime. Oh, what I would do for more TITUS!!!Be forwarned that although this is a closed captioned set, I was unable to get the captions to work with these disks. There is a statement on the DVD that the captions may not work on all systems; I have tried numerous captioning systems and different TVs and DVD players, and still can't find one that they DO work on."
3,Interesting read.. but,"Given the hype and fuzziness over offshoring, and sourcing work to offshore locations, any book that has ""Offshore Outsourcing"" should sell... or that is my guess.Having just finished reading the book by Ms. Robinson and Kalakota, I began scanning the review comments on Amazon. Though most are overly positive, a few are not. I would tend to agree (though not entirely) with some of the points brought out by S Gardner in his review of the book.The book is a good primer on offshoring and one should definitely read it if looking forward to '20,000 view of sourcing strategies'. For managers, executives and decision makers looking to research beyond the `overview', there definitely are better sources.- Mohan Babu"
1,Propaganda,This Book is a Propaganda for projecting outsourcing the best option for big businesses and India is the best place for this business.
4,Good Balanced book despite all the negativity and hype,"This is a balanced book that not only informs, but provides examples of what and how companies are offshoring. In spite of all the hype surrounding offshore outsourcing, and the negativity, there is no denying the fact that laws of economics will always play out in the global marketplace, which we have embraced.A good informative book, easy to read too!"
1,Action Items of Value are Sorely Missing,"I agree with S Gardner. I ended up having to buy another selection on Outsourcing to get what I really needed. This is a great historical and statistical reference manual, but it will not ready you to successfully outsource.If you're looking for instruction to get you off the block in your outsourcing initatives, move on to other books on the subject."
1,Not worth the cover price .........,"This isn't a bad book, but it nowhere near justifies the cover price. There just isn't the information within to justify the cost of the book.After making the mistake of buying this book I went back and looked at some of the reviews. It is interesting to note the number of duplicates. Further, many of the reviewers have reviewed only this book. But wait; one of the reviewers has chosen to write a (negative) review of antother outsourcing text. Must be the suspicious auditor in me.Leaving aside the accuracy or intent of any reviews, my primary complaint with this text is the absence of any real coverage of risk (regional, IT, infrastructure........). And no real coverage of due dilligence. Mmm.Save your money: Gartner gives away more than this book provides."
5,I actually read this book :-),"After reading some of the caustic comments posted regarding this book, I thought it might be useful for people to hear a different viewpoint.I read this book after borrowing it from a co-worker to get an overview of offshore outsourcing. After attending a lot of internal meetings where managers throw out various buzzwords like BPO, ITO, near-shoring, offshoring etc. I needed a primer that had a lot of examples and case studies.I found the book useful in terms of providing a basic foundation in terms of what was going on. Was the book perfect, no. Was the book upto date in 2005, no. Did it provide a basic education and overview, yes. Did it provide some guidelines if you were to implement outsourcing, yes."
5,Solid Overview of the Offshore Outsourcing Trend,"This book provides a very thorough overview of the latest issues and trends in offshore outsourcing. I bought this book to get a deeper perspective of what is being discussed in every major newspaper or magazine. Also wanted to see which large cap stocks like GE might benefit from this trend.The best part of this book were the numerous case studies. The different case studies -- GE, British Airways, AMEX, Lehman, Dell, MetLife, Delta Airlines, Bellsouth and many others -- were very interesting and educational as they presented a real-world perspective of how large corporations are taking advantage of offshore outsourcing.Highly recommend this book if you are interested in this topic and really want to understand what is going on behind the scenes."
5,Excellence,"HELLO!!!""This is the music of my youth""With this band I was practically a kid and grew.Best RegardsNikola.M"
3,Get Roach's colorado thirteeners instead,"I got this book because it has a few summits that aren't even mentioned in Roach's Colorado Thirteeners book. This book doesn't have a single map in it. I would have much preferred maps over black and white pictures of some of the mountains. Also, there is no ranking system for difficulty. It just says things like ""a long scenic trek"" or ""varied terrain"" or ""an off trail climb"" or ""stiff rocky climb"" or ""steep climb."" Is a stiff rocky climb more difficult than a steep climb? Is varied terrain more difficult than an off trail climb? Who knows.If you want more info on te thirteeners that aren't mentioned in ""Colorado Thirteeners"" just go to 13ers.com and read trip reports."
2,very limited route information,"The guide covers a lot of peaks, but the route information for each peak is very limited, very general and there are absolutely no maps. You will definitely need to do some homework outside of what is contained in the book."
1,Re-Packaged Deception,"This release is nothing more than the Best Of Badfinger Featuring Joey Molland, cleverly re-packaged ( for the third time in as many years ). If you are looking to hear the original recordings of the original band from the early '70's Badfinger, you are not finding them here. One-time member Joey Molland handles the lead vocal on all these selections, and does not do them all justice."
1,ONLY VOLUME 1 and no others,VERY MISLEADING LISTINGThis listing and the actual book cover shows NOTHING about the fact that the book is only VOLUME 1 instead of the entire TEN VOLUMES that is shown in the title.It also has only fair to decent copies of the photographs. I would not recommend it.
1,The book was horrible,The book does nothing to help the reader to learn and understand grammar using the diagramming method. If you are interested in learning or brushing up on grammar this book is not for you. There is no connection in the book between grammar and diagramming. It was a waste of money.
1,Bogus book,"The illustrative diagrams contain several mistakes. If you're going to publish a book about diagramming, then you should make sure the diagram are right. Like phonics, sentence diagramming is not the panacea that its supporters claim it is."
4,Great discussion about diagramming sentences,"Sister Bernadette's Dog is a humorous and engaging discussion about diagramming, the ""lost art of grammar"". My husband and I remember diagramming sentences as one of the rites of passage of elementary and middle school. It no longer happens, much to the detriment of students today. There is something very engaging about writing sentences of complete nonsense but still being able to diagram them correctly. Sister Bernadette's Dog describes this all so very well.This is enjoyable to those who remember diagramming with fondness or those who wish they did or could."
2,Talking about language,"If you are the sort of person who enjoys language for its own sake, then you may enjoy this book. Well, I'm not and I didn't. If you really want to bursh up on grammar or diagramming, this book is too unfocused to be of much use."
2,Diagramming sentences,"This book really is a history of diagramming sentences, so this better be your passion or the book will not hold much appeal for you. I thought the title was a humorous, tongue-in-cheek reference to some topic to be revealed in the book, but I was wrong. It is a businesslike history of the diagramming of sentences!! It is well done and if this is of interest to you, you will enjoy the book."
1,Marred By Pointless Political Potshots,"I was excited to find this book and enjoyed it as much as the other reviewers seemed to--until several chapters into it the author began making gratuitous, snide political remarks. I ignored the first of them, but they soon became so distracting I put the book aside in disgust. If I had wanted to read political commentary, that's what I would have bought. I would have accepted her broad interpretation of what comprises a ""Quirky History"" had she not used it as a platform for hurling insults. Her editor, if she had one, should have striken them out."
1,Boring - for English teachers only,"Boring book. I can""t imagine anyone liking this book other than maybe English teachers. It has little merit as literature, and provides very limited diagramming instruction, so I fail to see its purpose."
3,Unexpected,"I just finished reading _Sister Bernadette's Barking Dog: The Quirky History and Lost Art of Diagramming Sentences_, a book about sentence diagramming. By ""art"" she refers to beauty and not a system of principles and methods, and by ""about"" I mean surrounding not on the subject of. The book is rather short and recalls the author's happy childhood, gladly diagramming sentences in front of class. She talks about its history, its future, its admirers, its uses, and its failings. The one thing missing from the book, the one thing that I was really hoping for, is a good tutorial on how to diagram sentences. Oh well, I guess that's why we have the Internet."
2,Born in 1967 and Disappointed,"I bought this book mostly because I would love to know how to diagram a sentence, and because I thought it would take a fun approach. The book, however, assumes that you already do know how to diagram a sentence (or at least knew at one time because you learned it in school). Even if the book had taken just 5-10 pages to outline the basics, it would have given me the stepping stones to appreciate and enjoy a lot of the rest of it. Instead, I felt like an outsider looking in, and I felt a bit like the book was mocking my ignorance.Some of the content also gave the impression of an inside joke that if you didn't go to a Catholic school or if you weren't more baby boom than gen-x that you wouldn't quite get. I didn't get it."
5,Well worth the money and the effort,"With this third installment, the series has blossomed into a classic. Large territories are covered, and the cultures are well defined. (Yes, there is a map this time.) Two plotlines are followed, fights are expertly narrated, and characters are fully developed and complex; no pure good or pure evil. Everybody is fallible including the authors. There is a key flashback that is out of context and appears to be available only to the reader, and a few details could perhaps be quibbled with, but that is nitpicking. Go for it!"
2,Series No Longer Interesting... Can't Follow Up First Book Well,"I'm not really sure what I expected from this novel, but what I got wasn't it. This is Magiere's origin story, but it raises far more questions that it solves. It felt like an in-between type novel with action falling flat and mysteries more annoying than enthralling.The characters were unique... but the plot was meh, the 'romance' wasn't present or paired characters I didn't like (and therefore didn't care about), and the action wasn't inspired. Authors write a good description, but can't back it with plot.Be warned, this is the turning point of the series. Weird to write for book two, but the anomaly is book one -- great compared against the rest. I stopped this series completely after book six because the authors can't write an interesting plot. I'd only keep reading if you thought this book the best in the series, because it gets *much* worse (in my opinion)."
5,Very enjoyable,"Once I finished the first book in the series, I knew I had to read the rest of the series. The description of the world has continued to be strong and the characters remained interesting to me. Excellent read!"
5,A thrilling read,"I don't normally read vampire books but after reading the vampiric earth series It got me interested. When I read the first book in this series I was hooked. The hendees have a writing style that I love. Its not common for me to come across a book where both sides ""good"" and ""evil"" are blended together so well. I also like how you get to know the vampires magiere is hunting. In sister of the dead I cant help but feel more hope for chane and welstiel then I for magiere. Its a book i couldn't put down once I started. The new romance between magiere an leesil is kind of a down point to the book. Other then that the book is a great read. I can't wait to read the 4th installment."
5,Good sequel,"I just want this story to hurry and wind up. I really relish the characters. They love each other, but they both have horrible things they are living with.The peripheral characters add more than just background noise and color. The reader really wants to know what's going to happen next.What is going to happen next?"
3,Was I the only one who found this boring?,"I've read the first 2 books in the series, and they were pretty good. This one just about put me to sleep. There were passages where the writing bogged down so badly that I just skipped over them. Thank goodness it was a library book!"
5,Wow,I was so glad to be able to get all the books of the first saga at once. It meant weeks of enjoyment!
2,can be used with extra work,it said this one can be used in my 99' Sienna but the connector doesn't fit the car. I had to cut the wires and connect it to the old connector. Anyway it work with a lot extra work of wire-ironing.
4,It works.,The part number is scratched off from the part. It is a DENSO part. It works as advertised.Cheap shipping to Canada. Took a little more than a week to arrive.
3,Not for the novice,"This might be a 5 star for someone with scientific knowledge of grasses, but if you are a novice, wait until you have more experience before getting this book.What I needed was a photo guide with clear pictures and descriptions in layman's terms."
3,my middle school grandkids loved it.,"This tape is a hoot! My visiting grandkids, age 10 and 15 (girl and boy) listened to it at least 4 times, repeating all the funny or scary parts by memory and waiting for the next favorite part to come along so they could join in. As we drove back to the airport they listened right up to the last second, wanting to cram in every word they could to memory."
1,The worst!,"This book covers picking out fax machines in detail, but nothing about home inspection. I expected to find some information on training courses, maybe some information about the politics of dealing with realtors and owners, etc. It was all very generic. At one point it discussed how to start your own home business selling lingerie (obviously not well edited from the last version of the book). Don't waste your money."
2,Not very strong.,"On Eddie's 7th studio album ""Nothing To Lose"", #49, his chequered career again rears it's ugly little head here, after the comeback album ""Can't Hold Back"". He did produce his last top 10 hit at #9 with a pretty good mid-tempo rocker ""Walk On Water"", also #2 mainstream rock. Eddie gave us 3 more hits ""The Love In Your Eyes"", #24 hot 100 and #1 mainstream rock, ""Let Me in"", #30 mainstream rock and #60 hot 100 and ""Forget About Love"" #36 mainstream rock, but none of these tunes I just didn't care for much. I did find ""Magic"" and ""Dancing With Mr. Jitters"" good songs. I never bought another Eddie Money after this album. ** 1/2 stars overall."
2,Probably a faulty switch,When installed the switch crashed my computer on a regular basis. I returned it for a refund.
5,Great Books,The Tennis shoe series is one of the greatest things that ever happened to the written word. I was getting worried with Jim getting older how Chris would keep the series going. I think making it from harries view was ingenious. I can't wait for part two
5,great book i cant wait for the next one,this was one of the best book i have ever read. I have to say i have read this series about 7 or 8 times and i love it more every time the only bad thing about book 5 is the way it leaves you hanging
5,this is such a faith-building book for lds people and others,This is a great book that follows along a great series of books. I hate to read and yet couldn't put these books down and almost got behind in my schoolwork because of it! I really enjoyed the whole series and can't wait until the next one comes out (part 2)!
4,Told With a Twist of Lemon!,"This book does not explore anything new in terms of presenting new Urban Legends. But, it does dramatize well known legends giving them a new flare. Very good book."
3,Classic Urban Legend Tales,"Spiders in the Hairdo is a collection of well known and in most cases frequently told myths, camp fire stories and I heard from a friend of a friend or a friend rumours. The majority you will have heard before but this is a good compact sized collection of some of the best tales. You've got the knife wheeling maniac in the back seat (as told by Auto on the Simpsons) who in this book is a rope strangler. The unwashed hair full of poisonous spiders, the hook on the lovers' car door, scuba diver in the tree after a forest fire and all the world's favourites.They are quite good versions in this book and this collection is just as good as as lot of other books out there such as The Big Book of Urban Myths or the Darwin Awards Trilogy.Spiders in the Hairdo is not however in the same high quality league for this genre as Hippo Eats Dwarf by Alex Boese, Great Mythconceptions by Karl Kruszelnicki,The Truth Behind Old Wives Tales by Thomas Craughwell"
4,Different reading,"This is a book for older kids who want to have some different reading, besides chapter books. My daughter likes to read this book before bed. It has some off-the-wall stories which appeal to her sense of humor. It has some ""adult type"" topics [like the woman hiding in her closet naked] which may not be suitable for all children."
2,Documented change in God's Law,I keep several copies of this book on hand for sharing to demonstrate how the Catholic Church claims the authority to change God's Law. See page 50. See also Daniel 7:25.
2,poor,"The book was what I wanted, but it was in poor condition. It was suppose to be in very good condition and when I got it the pages were brittle and yellow in color. When I opened the book it separated from the middle and pages started falling out. I will have to purchase another copy, but for now it does what I bought it for. To show people that the Catholic Church changed Gods laws. Changing the 4th CommandmentSabbath from Saturday to Sunday. How appalling that people don't even care who they worship!!"
4,Worth While Seeing,Bryan Genesse from TV's Street Justice Stars in Grade B Actioner about a group of deranged criminals take over a train whith a renagade CIA Operative on Board. Usual action no big surprises but the viewer gets to see some great action sequences on and off the Train. The Only problem i have with the film is the ending was too incoherent It seemed like the director wanted the movie to end in a lame way. The film's strong point is Bentley Mitchum the villian of the film took great relish in portraying a psycho mouthy killer with a meanstreak who gets what he derserves. Not a bad film i have seen much worse in the past. At least this film can hold my attention.
3,Not up to some other versions,"This production of the classic was just okay. I have seen other versions which flowed more smoothly. Also, it appeared as though the production was done on a shoe string budget. The settings were barren and some actually appeared to be in ruins. While this may have been done for artistic reasons, it distracted from the story."
5,Good movie!!,"The book always beats the movie, but I have seen much worse renditions of this one. Still--read the book too!"
4,Sense and Sensibility BBC 1981,"A good BBC production, I wanted to see a different version of the 1995 film based on the novel of Jane Austen, directed by Ang Lee, with Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman. This BBC version is more similar to the novel written by Jane Austen in 1811"
4,Surprisingly Excellent,"To my shock and amazement, I stumbled upon a hidden treasure. This work is brilliantly and beautifully captured -staying true to Jane Austen's masterpiece. In fact, unlike the 1995 motion picture with Emma Thompson, there is a hidden surprise in this more accurate depiction of the story. I won't spoil it for you-but it's quite clear that the 1995 version missed one of the most important portions of Austen's tale of love lost and found. I will admit, I was VERY SURPRISED by how expensive this viewing turned out to be, since you have to purchase each episode individually and those episodes are only about 40 mins. long. But the money is well spent! I only wish I could have purchased it on DVD to view whenever I need an Austen ""fix""."
2,watchable but deeply flawed- still fun,"Watchable but takes enormous freedoms with the novel... so beware... preserved the themes but in a literal way which eliminates some of the interesting way the book is written... the newer Masterpiece version and even the movie do not do this nearly as much... perhaps the worst transgression is the failure to show the sisters love and friendship and instead making them at first representing sense and sensibility in a heavy handed way and thus in opposition and this is not how the book unfolds and is unpardonable... also we are cheated with a flimsy and very quick beginning and end which is, well, stupid of the screenwriter because we are not shown Edward's hidden charms and how they unfold to Elinor so that she falls in love with him... also, Edward himself has a bad tupee and was not quite attractive enough in charm or looks for the story to make sense... and to make a quick exit of the great ending is unforgivable... still worth a watch."
3,Just so-so,"I sappose I've been spoiled by the Emma Thompson, and the Hattie Morahan versions, with the Morahan version being my favorite (love me some Captain Brandon! woof!). This version was just ""ok"". I hated the fact that they cut out the third Dashwood sister. The acting was a bit stiff and ""stagey"". I checked it out at my local library, and I probably won't again. on the other hand, I keep re-checking out the Morahan version over and over and over again. I own the Emma Thompson version, but it's not my favorite.If you want to see a really really good adaptation of S&S;, watch either the Thompson or Morahan versions. This one just barely rates 3 stars."
2,Old school period movie...,This IS your mother's BBC. Dry and stiff. A better bet is the new Andrew Davies screenplay version.
2,veddy veddy stiff upper lip indeed,"this production is indeed, as many BBC productions are, faithful to the point of pain. It is just too easy for most of the cast to repress their passions and desires.The exceptions to this are the performances of Marianne, and most explicitly, Peter Woodward as Willoughby. If you have seen PW's performance as Galen in Crusade, and are looking to see more, order this. He is absolutely electric on screen, and simply beautiful.Though he looks better now, imo, with less hair and more mileage."
3,"I like it, but...","This story was slow and too long. Especially, Bosco Hogan as Edward, he had no charm or persuasive power. May be the adaptation was dull. I think he was important person in this story."
2,not as good as the Emma Thompson version,"I thought that this movie was not faithful to Jane Austen's intent. It was slow and the acting was basically non-existant. If you want to see a good adaptation of S&S, watch the 1995 version with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet as the two elder Dashwood daughters. It was a much better adaptation."
4,"CD included , (but not meant for exercises!)",Forget my previous comments of yesterday made in a fit of frustration. I have discovered that the .dwg files used during the exercises are in fact created by yourself as you go through the book. Duh. The PDF files are useful in their own right. It's a good book! Now where was I... Chapter 2
3,Architectural Desttop 3.0/3.3 for autoCad,This is a book I need to refresh my memory on the program it's been about 5 years sence I use this programit will be awhile before I use the book but it's just what I wanted. Thanks for the price also.
2,Where are the drawing files on the CD ROM?,"I have a problem with this book:The copy I received came with a CD ROM. Throughout the book are exercises which begin with opening a named drawing eg EX2-1.dwg (presumably from the CD). However, the entire contents of the CD I received are PDF files- not a .dwg file to be found. Not much use for trying to complete exercises, or (am I missing something??) and I agree with a previous reviewer, extremely frustrating!Other than that, if I could only open some of those drawings that keep cropping up throughout the book, and complete the exercises, it would probably be a very useful book. A copy of the proper CD would be appreciated."
4,Self-Hypnosis Edgar Cayce,The speaker had a good hypnotic voice and explained the whole process well.This is not a one time experience. In order to learn self-hypnosis you need to listen to it regularly for a number of times.
2,Couldn't Spray a Rooster!,"Bought this to carry when walking my dog to protect from a neighborhood bully. One day I had a rooster come to live on my front porch that cock a doodle doo-ed every morning for a month at 4:30 AM. I thought maybe I could spray the rooster so it would leave and this spray fizzled out at the spout! It wouldn't reach a foot in front of me, and I couldn't even spray the rooster! So, thankfully, I learned a good lesson, not to trust this spray when a mean dog approached us, it wouldn't have even protected us. I thought it would shoot out like hornet spray, but it was more of a weak stream. Oh, well. Good try. Animal control finally brought the rooster back to it's rightful owners."
2,Was hopeful,"Just moved and have had a fox messing with our puppy when we have her out on the line. I would watch and try to scare off the fox, which would get within 4ft of me. I thought this would be the most humane way of scaring off the fox. Well, it shoots like 3ft. I refuse to get closer than 4ft, I really do not want to get rabies shots. Not sure if I have a bad product, but for $8 I am not going to go through all the trouble of returning it."
3,not legal in NewZealand,Don't know how good it is as it is not legal in NewZealand. Bought it for a friend who is a postie and has a few dogs that have been a bit intimidating so thought it would be a good thing to have as a last resort.unfortunately she got a phone call from customs and had to go and see the police as it is illegal to import the halt dog repellent as it may be used as a weapon or against police dogs. so not a good outcome.
5,Useful,"I've purchased Halt! Dog Repellent before, so I am familiar with the product, but of course, I will not know its effectiveness until I need to use it. At least, I feel more secure walking my two tiny dogs because I have some protection against a dog attack."
1,Don't waste your money,"Used this product on 2 agressive dogs while on a walk...it only sprays a ""stream"" about 6 feet (so you will probably get bitten unless you are a really really good shot). Very disappointed,just ordered a ""mace gun"" that takes cartridges and says it shoots 25 feet. Hopefully this works better than Halt!"
1,I AM A MAILMAN...THIS STUFF IS USELESS,"i am a letter carrier for the usps in a pretty rough part of town. its very common to have to jump back into the truck because a one or more loose pitbulls will be roaming the streets. this spray is all we are allowed by the post office to carry for our protection and it is a joke. this spray will stop a chihuahua for a minute but anything bigger just stops to lick it off its face. i have sprayed this at different types of terriers, pitbulls, mutts, german shepherds and pretty much any other kind of dog you can think of, and trust me, through personal experience, this is a waste of money. if youre looking to buy something to keep dogs away, try a sonic dog repeller. they work much better."
4,"Halt! Dog Repellent, 1.5 oz","I bought this item because I was involved in a dog attack where I had nothing for protection. My client's dog had to go to emergency for stitches and I was knocked to the ground by the offending Newfoundland. When I received this item, I tested it out in a safe area to be sure the spray worked. It did work. I got a small amount of the residue on my hand and it did burn. I could also smell the chemical. It made me cough a little. Although I haven't used it on another dog yet, I did see a postal carrier have a can attached to her belt. That made me feel I made the right purchase. I don't walk dogs unless I carry this item. I gave it 4 stars because I haven't used it yet."
2,A Diluted Pepper Spray,"On the bottle, it says ""0.35% Capsaicin or related capsaicinoids"". That is a quite diluted pepper spray.I test-sprayed it at a distance of 7 feet. The wind blew some mist back at me and I didn't smell a pungent smell or sneeze or have difficulty breathing like a real pepper spray had done to me.Are they trying to be humane to the vicious killer dogs?Since there is no aiming mechanism and the condition may be windy, you are very likely to miss when you first press the firing button. You have to continue pressing and adjust the direction of the spray.I would rather carry a true pepper spray."
3,Works good if your dog is not already being attacked.,I bought this item after my dog was attacked by a pit bull. The same pit and another attacked another dog in my neighborhood. The pit that was already gripped on to the dog this spray did nothing. The other pit was ready to attack also but I used the spray on it and it ran away. Nothing can stop a pit bull if it is already attached to its prey!
5,Got for walking my two rottie puppies.,"Bought this product to walk my dogs in our rural area, we have dogs that are not on a leash, which is illegal but some people just don't get it. So I hope I never have to use, it but I hope when I do it works as others have stated. We also have bears and other animals in our area, so got it to keep my dogs safe. Thanks."
1,Very Disappointed,"As a professional dog walker, my first interest is in the safety of myself and the client dog entrusted to my care. I purchased this product with that in mind. On one occasion, I had a large unleashed dog spot me and my client dog, my first reaction was to calmly try to go the other way, but I could see the unleashed dog was determined to come at us. I stopped, had my HALT in hand and used it (I did feel the stream distance was good),but it did NOT deter the dog. I think I soaked his face, but it did nothing more than squirting water. Thankfully the unleashed dog's owner came out of the house and retrieved his dog, and apologized. I would not purchase this product again, nor would I recommend it."
4,Like it/Haven't used it - yet!,"Following recent fri/sat fights thru our ranch fencing; neither wanting to let go; neighbor's $300./my $288. vet bills, I went on-line for the answer to breaking up future confrontations (neighbor's dog the aggressor) with the least amount of harm. I choose HALT!because of it's effectiveness and it is the choice of the U S PostalService."
1,fooled and displeased,The add that I saw online was not the product that I received in the mail I was under the impression that I was purchasing HALT II witch has a totally different potency level and I sent back a complaint e-mail and heard nothing back from amazon or anyone else until they sent me this review questionnaire which is weeks after I sent them my complaint e-mail. I would say. amazons customer service SUCKS big time and I will never buy anything from here again just out of principle alone.I was a little leery of buying anything online in the first place because of all the horror story's you hear from people saying it wasn't what they had imagined and now amazon just made me a believer.
2,Halt Dog Repellent,"Sprays only a couple feet, hard to handle on bike, top cracked - leaked all over."
5,A Terrific Product!,"This product was recommended many years ago by our mailman. I jog with my German Shepard Dog. I have on several occasions had to spray a dog who ran out of a yard toward us as we ran past. It stops a dog immediately. This stuff works!I gave a can to my Mother, who walks two chihuahuas. She had to use it the other day to stop a lab from coming up to her and her dogs.I cannot recommend this product enough. It works!"
5,A lie is the truth if you believe it!,"Steve Chandler does an excellent job of pointing out the ""as we think, so we become"", or a lie is the truth if you believe it.He deals with rethinking 17 key lies...from ""It's who you know"", to ""I'm helpless"", and 15 more in-between.Format of double spacing lines make the book as easy to read on one of the ""One Minute Manager"" books by Ken Blanchard. Also, the stories make the principles come alive, and make reading enjoyable.Has the potential of being a ""life-changing"" book."
3,Reader beware,"This is a good book but it's very religion driven, if you're ok with that then it's a good read and has some good ideas"
5,Superb Stuff,"I loved this book! I read it at a time of intense stress in my life, and found the concepts more than relevant to my situation.As a diabetic who has long harboured deep feelings of inferiority, I found the section ""There's something wrong with me!"" absolutely life-changing. My professional life has taken on a new glow, and for the first time in 5 years I am having fun working.I'm sure that some of these ideas are available elsewhere BUT not in such a readable format. And it's the readability that makes the book so useful."
5,Steve Chandler Tells The Truth So We Can Hear It,"After listening to Steve Chandler's tape of the book 17 Lies That Are Holding You Back and The Truth That Will Set You Free, I was able to approach each day with a greater sense of honesty and found myself recognizing the lies with myself. It has helped me to change things about myself that I have been working on for years.I had a sense that this book had grown out of years of Steve's personal experiences, struggles, and triumphs, which made the book even more authentic, for me.There are LOTS of self help books out there. I believe I have read at least half of them. 17 LIES does just that..... it helped me to help myself...and start becoming a more honest person..Thank you, Mr. Chandler!"
4,"A good pick-me-up, removes attitudinal cobwebs","I usually read books of much greater intellectual depth than this one, but where it comes up a little shallow in this regard, the book proves very deep on attitude. It reads very quickly and provides a good attitudinal boost. I think the book probably reads especially well for people immersed in sports culture with lots of references to things like NASCAR. While the author does not seek to provide a complete program for living, he provides some very valuable reminders that can provide excellent tools in any endeavor for effective living. No matter what your starting point, I think everyone will feel a little more empowered after reading and understanding his basic messages. I think we all could recognize at least some, if not all, of the seventeen lies, as they reflect very powerful self suppressing memes that permeate our culture, and that we probably have all told ourselves and others at one time or another."
2,Lying About The Ego Trying To Be Happy,"The author's daughter, Stephanie contacted me, and I am sure, many others to review her father's book. I have to say as an author myself of such books as The Dream Cards, a consciousness and wisdom tool for dreams and life, I find this book one more self-help book doing what I call 'polishing the ego.'Trying to give the ego all sorts of tips on how to live life may be good for high school students just learning about life but the fallacy in this style of writing is that just telling the person to 'pursue happiness,' 'live your own life,' Listen to your loves in life.' (page 233) and so on just misses the point. Feeding the ego all sorts of truisms will hardly make it effective in life, as I have seen from my work as an international teacher and psychologist.I don't recommend this book. It's full of pronouncements and 'I psychology.' Get real! The real lie is in praising the ego and making it feel it can do most anything in life.-Strephon Kaplan-Williams"
2,Nothing motivational in this book.. Don't waste $,"I read other books of steve chandler 100 ways to motivate yourself and was lot better than this one. If you already that one, don't waste money on this. You can read a whole chapter but I bet you won't know what he is talking about. Examples he gives in this book are not solid enough to convince what he is saying.I expected lot from this book but totally disappointed."
1,What A Bunch Of Bull,This was a horrible book. I bought this audio book because of all the positive feedback that I read. I listened to it and could not believe what an idiot the author is. He goes on and on about things he thinks he knows something about and therefore considers himself an expert. He is so full of himself and boring. His monotone voice is enough to make you want to shoot yourself.The only truth that will set you free is to know that this audio book isn't worth a darn and that the author is making a fortune spreading his bull around.
5,Easy Reading and a Great Inspiration,"I'd give this book 6 stars, if it were possible to do so. Steve's sense of humor in the midst of all his inspiration is very well done. It made me laugh out loud at several points. Somewhere I've heard this book compared to ""A Road Less Traveled,"" but I think ""17 Lies..."" is even better. Steve shared his soul with us and by the end of the book, I felt like I just met a great new friend. This book was so compelling that I read the last half of it in one evening. I highly recommend this to all my seminar participants and have linked it to my web site."
5,17 Lies That Are Holding You Back,"17 Lies That Are Holding You Back surpasses other books written by Steve Chandler in that it cuts away all the ""stuff"" people hid behind and gets right to the real negative beliefs of life (lies) which hold us back.In it he enumerates the 17 Lies but sums up by saying there is only really just one and that is lying to one's soul.He describes 17 ways we do this and lets us know how to stop. It is must reading for anyone who wants to grow.Dr. James V. Durlacher, international lecturer and author of Freedom From Fear Forever."
5,I love this show and I think it will not harm any body if it comes out on DVD,I really would like to see this show make it on DVD since it only lasted for 17 episodes (4 episodes for the first season and 13 episodes for the second seasons).I think many people would like to see it again and I am one of them.
1,The Worst,"This show was one of the biggest flops of all time. The jokes were stale, the plots predictable, and the singing was awful. Let this stay a bad memory and don't release it to DVD."
3,"OVERRATED, who is the key grip and stunt men?","duanes tune is a very very good song. this band is very talented. that being said, these guys dont sound like a great band. they sound like they should be doing songs for soundtracks for 80's movies. i mean listen to it--they sound like they should be played during the credits of spaceballs or wierd science. i am an ALLMANIAC (peachhead) as well, but this sounds neither like dickey's nor greg's style.i like dickey betts & great southern better."
4,"This book was published forty years ago, but young people can still identify the story","This book is pretty dated in many ways -- it's nearly forty years old -- but April's struggle to keep her life under control is timeless. Children trying to deal with an inadequate parent (whether mentally ill like April's mother, or perhaps drug-addicted, or whatever) will definitely empathize with April. She is trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy, keep the sheriff away, keep herself from being sent to a foster home, and keep her mother from wandering off as she is prone to do."
4,Well built.,"I put this on my trolling motor, I liked it. It's does a good job, It was that or in the back of the boat. I would recommend this to others."
5,Perfect scissors,"These scissors are my little secret. I use them for many things around the house. I cut heavy duty materials like carpet and light duty things like rags as well. I hardly ever use them for their intended purpose. In my opinion, Wiss scissors are the gold standard for electricians scissors. In the past I could cut real copper pennies with them--they are tough."
3,Not like it used to be,"I've been using this product for many, many years. I usually stock up on the shampoo and conditioner so it's been a while since I've had to purchase one. I recently ran out so I ordered the conditioner. I was shocked at how watery the conditioner is - my previous bottle of conditioner was thick. Maybe the company decided to change the formula and make it less thick but in any event, I don't love it like I used to."
3,Great book - flaps are delicate,"Save this one for a kid who won't pull the flaps themselves, because they *will* rip them, unfortunately :(But the content is great, that simple style that kids like. I don't have a problem with the choices in body parts or language, either - ""I've got"" is colloquial, but it's perfectly acceptable, and the kids you're reading this to can't read anyway."
4,"Toes,Ears,&Nose:A Lift the Flap Book",This is a colorful delightful book to use in teaching body parts. The flaps are big and easy for little ones to use. I like the fact that the babies pictured in this book are from a variety of ethnic groups.
5,Excellent Baby and Toddler Book!!,"My daughter loved this book so much that it didn't last too long! She really enjoyed the flaps and couldn't wait to get to the next page! This might be a good book to read when they are around 15 months or so because they will be able to identify each body part to their own. And, they probably won't try to eat the book! This is a great purchase for any baby or toddler and would make an excellent gift! I am definately going to re-order a new one for my baby girl!"
3,Cute first book,"This book is good for babies around one years old. It is a nice change from all the animal books available. The reader can pull parts of clothing away from the book baby to reveal a nose, hands, toes etc. and the baby can compare his body part with the one in the book. The only thing that was a little off-putting to me was that the the babies in the book were mostly girls and I have a boy."
4,great book...,"We've been reading this book to our one year old son since he was born and he loves it. Around six months, he started flipping through the book and pulling on the flaps. The book is awesome but the flaps come off too easily. I guess you can't avoid that... We've reinforced all the flaps with tape and now they are staying on."
3,"""Rippable""","The book is darling, but the flaps are such a tempting attraction for a little one. The flaps over the ears were ripped off quickly in my granddaughter's eagerness to ""read""! Thick cardboard books are great, but the flaps need to be sturdier.Sue"
2,Great Book but Rips Apart QUICKLY- NOT DESIGNED FOR TODDLERS!,"My Son loves these books. However, the flaps rip off very easily. He really misses these books! Without a lot of effort or very aggressive ""lifting"", these flaps on several of Karen Katz's books ripped right off.Great books, but need to re-engineer these for toddlers and better wear & tear."
1,Not made to last,"My daughter enjoys this book. However, we have other books that have lift flaps that she loves. In this book the flaps are VERY flimsy and tear very easy. The first thing that happened was she pulled of the covers for the ears."
5,fine,"the flaps were missing but I was immeditaley contacted for a refund by the seller, I previously left feedback with another name S. Wilson, but I have since changed my account so I can't access that one to erase the negative feedback. I would buy from this seller again"
1,Boring...all torn to bits.,Pretty basic/boring flip book. All the flaps are now gone and overall I feel as though I should have never bought this book. Construction is fine…I’m just noting what most likely will happen to this and most other flip/flap books if child is left to ‘read’ on his/her own.
5,Great book,Good little book for babies. My 6 month old loves it. She pays attention to every page and loves to read it over and over.
1,Not safe,The flaps in the book are not securely attached and my 11 month old ended up with a big piece in her mouth while playing with it. At this point the content does not really matter as it is just not safe to have the book around.
1,terrible,"The condition I recieved this book in was terrible. It was a lift the flap book, all the flaps were torn out. There was also drawings all through it. I threw it out is was it such bad shape. This is the worst book I have ever gotten off Amazon."
1,never again,"The item would have been ok if I would have known the book was missing every flap. The seller failed to mention this despite claiming the book was in ""good"" condition. I don't consider a flap book without flaps to be in good condition. Next time I'll just try the thrift store."
3,"toes, ears, &... sternum?","This is comprehensive and exhaustively researched reference guide. After reading this intructive text you will learn the location of your toes, ears, nose, mouth, eyes, etc. My only qualm is that this otherwise learned tome fails to edify its readership on the location of the liver, the epiglottis and - most importantly - the cerebral cortex. I anxiously anticipate the second edition."
3,To delicate & advanced for 8 mo old,"I recieved this book as a gift. We love ""Where is Baby's Belly Button"" for our 8 month old twins. However, the flaps of this book are mcht too delicate for our little baby's hands. They have ripped multiple flaps off SO easily. Also, it gets into elbows & tongues - a little too advanced for us right now. We're still learning the very basics."
3,Too fragile for babies,"Cute cook, but my 8-month old ripped some of the flaps in it on the first reading. How strange that a book geared for babies and toddlers would be so fragile."
4,A Great Book--But...,"The book is easily destructible. We have barely any of the lift-the-flaps left! Baby Kenny's favorite thing to do is rip them off the pages! Other than that, all these books are fabulous!"
4,Nice interactive book,"I love the interaction that this allows for me to have with my baby. He truly seems to enjoy lifting the flaps in order to find out what is behind them. However, some of the ""flaps"" are too small and should have been bigger, particularily the flap that covers the ears, elbows, knees, eyes, and the belly button."
3,better for older child,My toddler likes this book but has torn a lot of the flaps. I prefer the flap books that have a stronger flap not just paper.
3,Not the best one...,"I have a lot of peek-a-boo books and this one is not the best one.The flaps on it are too thin and flimsy - it's hard for baby's fingers to lift them by himself. I need to go through entire book and pre-fold and lift the flaps, so my son can get it done after.Don't think it will last long either."
3,"Excellent scope, flimsy though","I generally have to try out a lot of books to find something appropriate and interesting for my 20 month old. Board books are a must because of the frequent and hard usage they receive. Many board books though are (surprisingly to me) too abstract or complex for his age. Toes, Ears & Nose! was just perfect for learning simple vocabulary, was short enough for his attention span, and he loves to lift the flaps. Like many (but not all) lift the flaps, though, the flaps were very easily torn off. I taped them back on the first few times we read the book, then gave up. The book is still entertaining to him without the flaps."
5,The Perfect Picture Book,"As a pet assisted therapy pair with my poodle. Coco, I am always looking for simple, beautifully illustrated books to read to the children when we ""Read to Dogs' at charities and libraries --- this is the PERFECT choice!"
3,Good book for busy boys,"I bought this book for my 10 month old who loved to handle books but not to sit and enjoy them being read to him or looking at them. He was just too busy and wanted the book to DO something. This one was great for him to open the flaps and see the parts of the body behind something. So it made the book proactive. I wouldnt recommend letting the young child play with it unattended, as my children like to tear when we are not looking. Overall, a good book for the starting their love of books. The body parts are a fun way to start teaching word association."
5,you may need two of these,"My 20-month-old daughter loves this book. She became very interested in learning body parts a few months ago, and this is a very fun book for learning about body parts and the clothes that cover them up. The illustrations are adorable and colorful, the text is simple, and kids love lift-the-flap books. We actually own two right now - one to keep out of reach when it's not being read and another for my daughter to play with to her heart's content. This way we don't mind a few of the flaps being torn off :) It's fun to hear her exclaim the body part before she can even get the flap lifted. Very cute book!"
5,educational and fun!,My 18 mth old daughter loves to read this book almost every night. She has learned almost all the body parts that are mentioned in this book. She loves to lift the flaps and can say the words.
2,Poorly printed and subpar writing,"My son loves nothing more than books that offer flaps that reveal items. In fact, we've never seen a 9-month old react so well to ""Dear Zoo"". So we though this was the perfect book to learn more about body parts. Unfortunately the quality of the book was awful. After two readings the flaps starting falling apart (this wasn't even my son's doing!). Then all of the other flaps just began to come off just by lifting them up and down. Even if the flaps were working I couldn't recommend this book to anyone. It had SO MUCH POTENTIAL with the writing...but alas, the writing is awful. The author is trying too hard to rhyme and make it a fun read, and what you get at the end is a book that has completely missed its mark. What a shame. Not even worth a penny. Do you want a good flap book? Trust me, get ""Dear Zoo""!Here's a link of a picture I took of one of the pages:[...]"
2,not good,"This book would have been great for my daughter had I gotten the entire book. I purchased it used as I do most often. The company that sent it to me said it was in good condition, every page had all the flaps ripped off. The flaps are a big part of the story. Not happy with that company I sent them an email and still no reply."
3,Love this book but the flaps are weak and easily torn off,Both of my boys loved this book as a 1 year old. BUT the flaps tear off so easily that I bought another one for the younger one. He ripped it almost right away - so that's disappointing. Next time I'm opting for the whole-page flaps. They stand up to toddlers much better. Cute little book though.
3,Slight dissappointment,Some of the flaps were rIppped and taped back On. Would have paid new price if I knew the pages would have damage.
5,Great!,A great book to teach body parts to your little one. My daughter loves to lift the flaps to see what is underneath them. A wonderful book!
5,"Your child will love it, but have your tape ready...","I gave this book 5 stars because it was a favorite of my daughter's for months and it helped to teach her body parts. She would get so excited to shout out ""ears"" as she lifted the ear warmer flaps. Of the books in the series, she enjoyed this one the most. The one drawback is that the flaps will inevitably tear off. So have your tape handy."
4,Nice book. Construction could be better,"My 20 month old son loves this book. He loves looking under the flaps and loves identifying the hidden body parts. The only thing is that the flaps are thin, and they will rip sooner rather than later. That being said, its still worth it."
4,"Great book, but...","My ten month old loves his Karen Katz books (we have four of them). He loves to lift the flaps as we go, but sometimes he gets excited and tears them right off -- the flaps are paper thin in this book. It seems like we're always repairing them. But that's the only downside...the illustrations are colorful and we always touch his nose when we get to the nose page and his ears, etc and he giggles. They're very cute books. I just wish they were sturdier."
3,Cute but....,"Cute book- great illustrations. My 17mo. old daughter and 6 mo. old son both enjoy this book. BUT, the flaps are really flimsy. My daughter, who *never* tears pages in books has torn off several of the flaps by mistake-This book was a disappointment. Don't waste your money- it will be ruined in no time."
2,Not as good...,"I have bought several Karen Katz books over the last year for our granddaughter.She enjoys Where's Baby's Bellybutton,but Toes,Ears,&Nose is not as good.Many of the flaps are very small and thin and do rip easily.Earmuffs?How many kids wear earmuffs?Under my coat is my back?True,but also a shirt under the coat.This book should have been written better than this."
2,"Toes, Ears, & Nose - A RIP the Flap Book!","I bought Karen Katz's 'Where is Baby's Belly Button' book which we loved as a family. So, I was deeply disappointed when I bought a couple months later, Toes, Ears, & Nose. This book is also a lift the flap book but the flaps rip SO easily. My son who has not yet ripped Where is Baby's Belly Button, ripped this one within the first day of getting it. The problem is, alot of the flaps are too small! The mittens, earmuffs, hands and sunglass flaps are so small that they tear much more easily than the bigger flaps of the other book. Dont waste your money!"
2,not impressed,"We bought this book after ""where is baby's belly button?"" was such a big hit in our house. we were disappointed. the idea is nice like the button book but with additional body parts. however, the flaps are smaller, making them harder to grasp, and are much easier to remove from the page. My son has looked at the button version many times with no real distruction but ruined several pages at first ""read"" of this book. this book is deinfitely made for older children."
2,Just ok,"This book has excellent illustrations, but the flaps are flimsy and tear off easily. Its also hard to get the rhyming pattern when you're reading through. Pass on this one."
2,BE CAREFUL!,"My baby loves the pictures on this book, but be EXTRA CAREFUL! The flaps can easily be ripped off. My baby chewed the flap on this book and vomitted!"
3,"a favorite, but flaps rip off very easily","My 15 month-old daughter LOVES this book, it's definitely one of her top five favorites these days. The only thing is that within two weeks she's managed to rip off most of the flaps. I've glued and reglued them, but it's just not staying together. She has many books with flaps and this is the only one she's able to take apart."
5,My Little Guys loved this book!,My little guys loved this book and the Belly button book by the same author. We read it together so much that they both had it memorized. (At least what was under the flap :-) We are now on our second copy as my 3 year old got a hold of it unsupervised and we lost several of the flaps. Great for teaching little guys the parts of the body
2,Cute story but new book was missing 3 flaps,We hoped this would be a fun way to learn body parts in an interactive book. The book arrived quickly but 3 flaps were missing. Very disappointing. It is rare for an amazon product to have a defect.
5,"Toes, Ears, and Nose",This book is very well liked in our nursery. most of the children are under 3 and they really like it.
5,Wonderful learning book!,"Lift-the-flap books are my favorite. The children just don't sit & listen, they interact with the book also. My children loved them when they were small and now I'm using them with my granddaughter. Toes, Ears & Nose! is one of her favorites. Love it!"
3,Cute but fragile,"My son loved the pictures in this book but almost immediately started ripping the flaps off. He has a few lift the flap books and this is the only one where he has been able to tear them off. It wouldn't be as problematic except parts of the text are actually printed on the flaps so those are gone now too. I could have tried reattaching some of them but most of them were beyond repair. Also, this may just be my OCD, but I would get annoyed while reading that the rhyming sentences weren't together in the same spread (ie instead of ""My shirtsleeves hide my elbows, my blue jeans protect my knees. My coat protects my back, and keeps my belly button out of the breeze"", it is ""And beneath my scarf is a nose. My shirtsleeves hide my elbows. My blue jeans protect my knees, my coat protects my back."") I know this seems picky but it is not why I am giving the book 3 stars. I just find it strange and it kinda interrupts the flow of the book."
1,Good content ... But poor quality,"Good book, but poor quality. Within hours after reading the book for the first time, my son was able to easily tear off almost all of the flaps. Now he finds it boring. I do not recommend buying this book."
2,Disappointed fan . . .,"My daughter LOVES Where Is Baby's Mommy and Counting Kisses, so I thought this would become another favorite. However, it is not nearly as interesting - the phrasing is boring, and is bugs the heck out of me because most of it is gramatically incorrect. ""I've got""?!?I assume that it's because Karen didn't actually write this one, so from now on, I am sticking to ones that she actually wrote.And for what it is worth, my daughter can be VERY rough with pages, and thus far, ALL of our Karen Katz books are still together. Wrinkled and crinkled, yes, but not one of the flaps has ripped."
3,Not too thrilled..,"I love Karen Katz illustrations in this book, but I wasn't too thrilled with the story-line. I thought it was a little choppy."
1,Pieces of this book are everywhere!,"I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer who called this a ""rip the flap"" book. Within a week of receiving this book, we started seeing pieces of this book all over the house... and in our baby's mouth, too! The flaps are merely glued to the pages, making them quite easy to rip them off. Definitely less secure than any other lift-the-flap book we've bought. Save your money on this one!"
2,thought it would be in better condition,The outside of the used book looked good. I opened the book and some of the flaps were completely gone and most of them were torn and barely hanging on. I was not please with this purchase.
2,Not great...,"I was dissappointed with the grammar in this book. One page reads...""under my shoes, I've got..."" and when you lift the flap, there are feet. I'd prefer to teach my child to say ""I have,..."" but that is just my opinion. My son (18mo.) seems to like it, though he has already torn off most of the flaps. They are just glued on and are probably intended for older toddlers (or for supervised play only.)"
2,what happened,"I have every victoria book ever published and this is the only one I did not like. Where were the flowers. I have a passion for anything with flowers on it, especially roses on fabric.I ordered this as part of an introductory offer to a book club and boy was I disappointed. There were hardly any flowers in the book. If you like the rest of victorias book you will not like this one. It was almost as if it were published by someone else."
5,Enchanting book filled with floral themes for the home.,This book is beautifully presented and allows the reader to journey through an indoor garden without the maintenance and care of living plants. There's useful information on china patterns that feature floral motifs and large photographs of colorful interiors utilizing various wall coverings.
5,Love this movie!,"This movie is great, even if you don't understand Spanish well. The music is gorgeous, and the characters and settings are so well drawn, you feel like you are right there! Also, from what I understand, the story is very close to the truth."
3,"Great graphics, pedestrian story","I wanted to like this movie so much. And for some parts I did - the graphics, the music, and Cuban history. However the central story of the love of Chico and Rita is so poorly written, with sparse character motivation, predictable plot points, even an ending that seems more tacked on that evolved.that I cannot give it any higher stars. The makers of the movie had such a wonderful opportunity to increase awareness of Cuba and its amazing culture and music. But the mistake was using these two flimsy characters to advance that cause."
5,An instant classic,"This has become one of my all time favorites. A simple story but magically animated with a heavy dose of history and an aural, both voice and musically, feast. It saddens me that I've lent it to friends who kind of tune out once they see it's animated. Do not make this mistake. This film validates animation the same way The Artist validated silent films."
4,CHICO AND RITA NOSTALGIA,"Excellent story illustrated by ""caricature-like"" animation of pre- and post communist Cuba, almost politically neutral, but nostalgic enough to bring back some great cuban music from the first half of the century. Other great north American composers and artists are portrayed in this journey back through time to happier times for the island and its talents. The British import Blu-ray has English subtitles that are non-removable, but not disturbing. The quality of the video is excellent, but the 5.1 DTS master soundtrack is absolutely exquisite. A very unique piece of filmmaking. I strongly recommend at least a viewing."
3,The movie has its moments but I found it hard to like,"The movie has a lot going for it, music, romance, but its a movie that doesn't feel period correct. There are a lot of assumptions on the part of the film makers in interpreting how Cuba was in the late 40's. The movie also shows Cubans to be mostly of dark skin but there were/are just as many of light to fair skin that were not represented as part of the general populous. I won't spoil the movie but the ""romance"" between the two characters could have been rewritten. I would recommend renting and see for yourself."
2,something missing,"An excellent concept and a great story...however, marred by poor editing and not too much depth! Disappointing!! Enormous Potential wasted!!"
1,Different opinion,"I found the book to be opinionated and rather negative about the U.S. I also found many of its statements odd. She says ""if students show up for class, they may get a ""C"" just for their good attendance."" About houses, she says, ""the East Coast and Midwest regions... often have a basement for the tornadoes or hurricanes possible in those areas."" About the Amish, she says they ""reject modern conveniences such as electricity, cars, air travel, jewelry and divorce."" The book is peppered with statistics, some of which are suspect or flat-out wrong such as ""the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports 35 million temporary workers, or nearly one third of our labor force, is made up of temporary workers."" The book also uses a lot of idiomatic expressions which I would imagine would make it hard to read for someone whose native language is not English. For instance, the section on marriage is entitled ""Tying the Knot"" but that expression is never explained."
5,Great Collection,"This is the perfect collection of stories with just the right amount of scariness. Not so scary that they give the kids nightmares, but scary enough for the kids to enjoy.Our favorites:The GolemThe ChangelingsRed Velvet RibbonThis book should be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys reading ""Goosebumps Hall of Horrors #1: Claws!""."
1,this book is not geared for American Children,"We have just begun camping with our children and I purchased this book for campfire stories. Unfortunately, I started reading one of the stories ""Wham! Slam..."" which the book said was geared to ages 7 and 8 (my audience). The story told of a witch who axed two children to death and then chased two others, killing 11 dogs with a swinging ax and knife. Luckily, she was killed by the 12th who jumped at ther throat. THe children who survived cut out her heart...etc. Not appropriate for most 17 year olds, much less 7-8 year olds. The cover of the book says ""for classrooms, storytelling settings, etc."" What school? Rated ""excellent"" by the very conservative Washington Times..."
2,Why don't these books take their audience seriously?,Stories of fright are designed specifically to re-engineer a classic theme in such a way as to leave the reader laden in a substaintial residue of unsavory - yet all too realistic - possibilities. The stories contained in this book fall so far short of said uneasiness that they seem to only encourage the already painful onslaught of boring children. Let us take our children seriously and follow through with a collection of scary stories that actually fulfills its promise of restless dreams.
3,:(,When I got this I thought it was going to be scary... it's NOT. Most of the stories I have read them and the rest were not scary and didn't make any sense! I would not tell any one about this book.
2,Not What I Expected.,"I bought this as a result from the two positive comments I read that gave it an average of 4.5 stars. This was purchased as a gift and fortunately it was not wrapped with cellophane so I first listened to it. The stories were not scary and they were just stupid. One story talks about a boy being chased by a coffin. The only way he was able to get rid of the coffin was a cough drop. Ha Ha. I was not impressed. The storyteller's vocal voice could have been geared for scary stories (spookiness, etc....)"
2,High Hopes,My five year old was very disappointed with this book. We only read a few stories out it and she decided it was a no go.
3,"powerful-ish, but WAY overpriced","I suppose it does a lot of stuff, but you'd think at version five it would be a little better developed. and it's overpriced by at least half, really no excuse for that. I use it, but only because i don't know of anything better; as soon as something else comes along, I am SO done with it."
1,DO NOT BUY - SOFTWARE WILL NOT FUNCTION,"The manufacturer of this software has gone out of business and shut down their authentication servers. You will, therefore, be unable to electronically authenticate this product. Without authentication, the software won't function at all."
4,Best book in the Videssos Cycle,Turtledove won me over when I first read this series ten years ago. His attention to detail and character development continues to draw me to his other books. You get a feeling that he spent more time on this book than many others. I couldn't put it down. A must read for Turtledove fans.
3,A superb fantasy read.,"Harry Turtledoves' ""Misplaced Legion"" has all the best elements. Namely: combat, magic, political intrigue, and even some romance. Such literary devices transformed me to a new and exciting land. The historical elements top this particular literary cake. All in all I heartily recommend this title & can't wait to read the sequels."
5,A great read,"This book is a great combination of political intrigue and war. The amazing accuracy that Turtledove uses to describe everything about Roman society is great. You really get the feel of Videssos and you get attached to the characters quickly. All in all this is a really amazing book that I'd recommend to anyone, whether you were into Turtledove or not."
1,Adriano Celentano?? Greatest Hits,"It came in a cardboard sleeve but I don't mind that. It seemed to fare better than the one that came in the plastic jewel that was broken when received. I however do not like the cd that well. The music is ok but does not sound (to me anyway) like the Adriano Celentano I am used to hearing on other cd's; music services and YouTube and other such services. Including his music videos. The picture seems in his mid years but the sound on the cd, if him, must be from very early years. Doesn't have the typical Adriano Celentano unique sound that is him. I thought at 1st maybe they had the wrong music in the wrong sleeve. I am disappointed as I love his sound."
1,Unknown hits :) ... paperback case...,"Bought it new from Caiman USA (Amazon marketplace). It came sealed in plastic but the CD case was not the usual jewel one but rather was made of cardboard which I consider less durable.The most disappointment, however, was caused by the content. This is my personal opinion but I cannot say that the songs on this CD are really wellknown hits. I have heard just one song from this CD before: Buona Sera Signorina. All the recordings sound very old. I used to have the other compilation, I think it was this one: ASIN: B00000I2FF, but I am not sure. It was much-much better."
5,Photography Book,The book was in great shape and delivery was timely! I save $50 over the bookstore price.
3,Have seen better Books,"This book is just too ""academic"". Wish it had deeper sense of real hands-on topics. It might be good for someone who is willing to know all the technical stuff in photography. After 8 editions, I wish it had a newer cover. It's a good book, but I've seen better ones. Thanks"
1,Dissastisfied,"I was hardly impressed with this textbook after having read Photography: Revised Edition by Horenstein & Hart. I don't care if London & Upton's book has been around for 8 editions. It's hard to read for very long because of its organization. The photo examples are not exciting and I found that the learning curve took a dive when my fellow students used this book in comparison to the Horenstein & Hart publication. I know this is a harsh rating, but I was not inspired or motivated with this book like I was when reading Horenstein's photography book."
3,A rehashing of dated material equals a declining value in the digital world,"This book at one time was a must have resource, but more and more it is becoming ""long in the tooth"" in the digital world. Sure some material is still valid to both digital and film photography, but the books value as a resource does not live up to the lofty price tag for a new addition.I had originally owned the 6th Edition as a course book. Recently a photography group in which I participate decided to do a focus discussion on the book. I purchased the 8th edition and found very minimal differences between the 8th and 6th. Save yourself money and don't bother with the 9th and latest version as you can get bargains on older versions in which the major differences may be which photos are used as demonstrations of a point."
2,Photography 8th edition,"OK to be fair ... the price got the low stars. It is a nice book but I would never have bought it if it wasn't a required book for the photography class I took. I never used it and still managed an A in the class. It IS nice ... not totally digitally friendly, it's heavy on the film side but many of the concepts will translate to both. If you are new to SLR photography there is a better book to get ... it's called ... Understanding Exposure by Bryan Peterson. It's also one fifth the price :o|"
4,Great Source For Core Photography Information,"Photography, now in its eigth edition, is a great source for core photography information. As in the previous editions, the information about photography's beginnings and history is very well covered. The emphasis on film and film based cameras is alos very extensive.My only real complaint about this book is its rather sparse discussion of digital photography. The authors could have gone so much deeper in the areas of digital cameras, digital imaging and working with digital files. As the most popular high school and college photography book, I believe it is a disservice to give such little treatment on digital photography. Also, there is vertually no mention of manipulation software programs like Adobe Photoshop. No serious photographer can still completely ignore this powerful manipulation tool. Students should be learning how to use this software and this is not the book to do that."
3,IRON ON...,"Thought it was embroided, but it in fits easily and good for the purpose! I kept it, not return!"
2,Annoying Seams,"I liked the design on it, although I wish it was embroidered. But the seams on the wheel cover are annoying. Your hands get caught on the seams around the design when the wheel is coming back around after a turn. The seams on the inside of the cover are not flush where it is sewn together and so you have this sharp point that sticks out and stabs your fingers when you grab it. Very disappointed. Took it off after a few weeks."
2,Not exactly ground breaking,"""Ask your customer questions.""""Don't keep a pen in your shirt pocket, it may leak.""""Don't drink coffee at a sales meeting, you might spill it.""If these seem like brilliant, grounbreaking revelations that will help you increase your sales, then this book is for you. Otherwise, you may want to look somewhere else. There is nothing new (or even interesting) here."
1,Weak and cliche,"If you need this book to tell you ""Don't talk with food in Your mouth"" then you should have a chat with your mom on why she didn't teach you table manners.If you find anything in this book to be new or useful then you are a very bad sales personStick to the classics from Miller Heiman like Strategic selling."
1,waste of money,"I can't believe I'm being told how to dress, where to put the ball point pen, and not to talk while chewing food. Is he suggesting this program is for professional, intelligent adults? I read the reviews before I bought it, but got the CD audio version from Nightingale Conant thinking it was expanded in some way, but indeed, the negative reviews for the book are applicable here. Save your money, if you are under 14 years of age, just ask your Dad for common sense tips... it's probably better."
4,Be the Rainmaker,"Like any book on sales or marketing, you take what you need to boost your career and leave the rest ""on the table"". What I loved about this book is the quick read it gave, many of the chapters were a page or two. Many of the reviews here criticize the suggestions made in the book. Simply put, if it doesn't fit for you, don't use it. The power of this book is the advice on no longer making excuses, remembering that a potential client can always be around the corner, and getting good manners is a worthwhile investment.Jeffrey Fox provides his advice in a format that is an easy read and can be used nearly immediately in your career. I highly recommend this book."
1,Am I being Punked. Where's the camera?.,"This is one of the worst marketing and sales books I have EVER read! This book is a joke, right?I'll take that back. If you know a 13 year old kid thinking of starting a lawn mowing or baby sitting business, then on second thought, this is a good book to read.For anyone over the age of 13, this is a cliche written piece of junk."
3,Good for Beginners,"This is a good book for those beginning a sales career--good basic information on ""etiquette"" and sales that aren't always covered in the orientation.For sales managers whose teams may have become a little sloppy, it's a good refresher, too.I like the point system, particularly. While it's not new and there are many similar methods around, this one is easy and will help those who tend to get tied up in non-sales activities to regain their focus.The ""canned"" sales questions and tactics do make my skin crawl. I've listened to too many ""trained"" sales reps who follow the ""method"" to the point where I can predict their next three questions. And, I've always found the ""rapport"" part of the sales call useful, whereas Fox seems to advocate an almost abrupt ""down-to-business"" approach. Different strokes, I suppose.Overall, I'd recommend it as part of a sales library."
5,How to Become a Rainmaker by Jerry Fox,"Read this book if you are a salesperson or desire to succeedin private entrepreneurialship. The first and most importantrule is to give the customer what he/she wants. The authorsencourage readers to treat customers as we would want tobe treated- sort of a golden rule applied to sales. It isimportant to discuss a specific appointment time and date in order to gain access. Salespeople should be attentive topotential ""buy signals"". Lastly, ""fish where the fish go"".The authors stress that successful sales require that wesocialize with the people who will be making the purchases.The book is a good value for the price charged."
5,How to become a rainmaker,Awesome. Simple. Lists to follow. Used just 3 of the 10 items that are suggested daily and had results. I logged on to Amazon to order 6 copies for clients/friends.. and found it was not available...
1,catchy title but they guy can't write,"Jeffrey Cox probably gives talks to people and gets mileage from making them feel inept. If you want to be condescended to, read this book. There are hundreds of references to rainmakers as if rainmakers are some sort of ideal persons. And the style of writing is atrocious. Many times three or four sentences in sucession begin with ""The Rainmaker..."" Just to give an idea of the tone, I have copied a paragraph from chapter 12 on how to act at a restaurant. ""Order something easy to eat. Order only one course. Order something inexpensive."" Gee... With all these commands on us whimpering salesmen who don't know our our heads from our butts, how did we manage without this book? So if you still insist on reading it, I recommend the following: Keep your head up, and see if you can sift all the tough-guy rhetoric from the good advice."
3,How To Become A Rainmaker,"""How To Become A Rainmaker"" is a good introductory title for anyone wanting to become an effective salesperson. The title is around 160 pages, may be completed in 2-3 sittings, and contains topics such as:1. Effective questions to ask.2. Why having a business breakfast is more effective than a lunch or evening meal.3. Always display good manners with others - says a lot about you as a person and sales representative.4. Using voice mail as sales tool.5. Showing customers how they will benefit from using your product and/or service.While many of the topics are really nothing more than common sense, it can be amazing as to how many times we forget to apply these principles. While not the most comprehensive how-to title out there, the book is a good intro to sales success and reminder to apply the principles that work."
4,The simple truth...,"This was a very simple, straight-forward, self help CD. It was recommended to me by a mentor of mine in order to ""polish"" my skills with customer service and communication. After listening to it, I was able to simplify not only my way of speaking, but my way of thinking. I minimized my ""over thinking"" process, and was able to make my point in sales calls much more efficient. This in turn helped me to gain more credibility with my customers.Although a lot of the content on this CD was something I'd already heard, or had learned in sales meetings and seminars, it was a great, quick and fresh reminder of what is needed in my busy day and work week in order to maximize my daily plan of action. Definitely worth it, just for that alone."
4,"reviews all the old school ""must do's"" in business.","This recommendation is based on having read dozens of books in this genre and taking thorough notes.This is a classic and reviews all the old school ""must do's"" in business."
4,"Making Clouds, not Rain","This short, easy read is a quick refresher course of the basic principals of selling. Mr. Fox breaks down the rainmaking, or sales execution, process into a number of sequential `Killer Questions' designed to turn your sales target into a frienly decision maker.As a former salesperson, I did find a number of the killer questions to be natural and direct, not pushy or canned. Mr. Fox also goes beyond simple client `probing' and hammers at the importance of a hard days work, getting the appointment and pampering your clients once you have sold them.I believe one should buy How to Become a Rainmaker. It is a quick read that offers enough unique material to help even the most seasoned salesperson. Will you become a rainmaker if you read this book? Nope...like every other rule in business, the rain will fall if you APPLY Mr. Fox's ideas."
2,I expected more.,Concentrated to much on the WHY and WHAT and not enough on the HOW (which is funny since the title is 'How to Become a Rainmaker'.)Most of the way through this book I kept thinking that I would just sell it on eBay or ask Amazon for a refund. I tried to stay positive and hope that I'd find a 'pearl of wisdom' which would make it worth my time to have read but I did not. I'm going to skim through it again (it's a really fast read) and if I don't find my 'pearl' - I'll start the bidding at a nickel.
5,Hone Your Craft!,"Thank you Jeffery Fox for writing a short concise work that sales professionals can use as a reality check to focus their attention on the selling process. Rainmaker is something you can refer to for brief reminders about what you should be doing during the selling process. The book is also available as an unabridged audio book. It is a great tool for sales professionals who want to hone their craft. If you only buy the book for ""The Rainmakers Credo"" and ""the Customer Does Not Care About You"" you will have gotten value. This is not a 300-page in depth how to sell book. If your looking for that try Jeffrey Gitomer's ""Sales Bible""."
4,Many insightful rules without structure,"The pro and con of this book is that it appears to be a list of useful insights for acquiring and maintaining relationships with clients. It is useful in the sense that one need not read the previous 25 rules to implement rule 26. However, a reader desiring a more structured, comprehensive approach might want to look elsewhere. I personally found it to be a good book for reading for a few minutes every day, because I didn't need to necessarily remember all the previous items I had come across."
4,Easy to read and full of good tips!,"This is a great book for anyone who wants a quick and easy reminder of what is important in sales and customer service. The chapters are short and to the point, and the entire book can be read in a couple of hours. More importantly, it has some good ideas for things you can do everyday to increase sales and revenue."
2,Good But Basic Advice,"The book is a good basic primer but with little depth. While some of the comments can be translated to the selling of services, it is geared at products, not services. If you have no sales experience, I'd recommended it. If your looking to expand on your existing sales skills, this might be too basic for your needs. I was disappointed in the book personally and thought I didn't get my money's worth."
2,Way to basic,"With a name like ""How to become a rainmaker"", one would expect powerful insight to the world of selling. This book is geared towards selling 101 (or remedial selling) at best. I felt that if I kept reading, I would gain something from this book. I was wrong. The only reason I gave it 2 stars, is that a person new to selling would like the very concise, yet basic concepts."
2,Misleading title,"Like other reviewers, this is a decent book on selling, but little insight on rainmaking."
4,"Easy read, solid content","The book is fairly well written, and very comprehensible. The book details a vast array of strong ideas of how to generate and maintain business. I would recommend this book to anyone who is going into a career in sales."
3,Sales 101,"I received this book as a gift as one of many sales people at a large company. Having been in sales for decades, I found much I was already aware of and practicing, so the book covers the basics. Some suggestions I did not agree with, but that's sales and we should take what we learn and adopt it to our own overall approach.However, it never hurts to refresh oneself at times, it is actually a good idea no matter how skilled you are.Basic, common sense stuff is in the Rainmaker. A quick read that might remind you of somethings you are overlooking."
5,"Concise, well-written and valuable","Working on financing projects for millions of dollars or hundreds of millions is made easier by simply applying the principals of this book. If you read it quickly (which is made easier by it's brevity) and apply the insightful ideas and thoughts - you'll see a marked difference. This book and the series in general are excellent.They have provided countless reads on airtrips and vacations! I can't say enough about sitting on the beach in Galveston with the gulf washing my feet and reading any of the books in this series.The, ""Killer Sales Questions,"" in this book are worthy of flash cards. I can tell you that all of our colleagues have been encouraged to read these books. In many cases, a set of them is given to each new team member as a gift from the office."
5,Djavan is DaMan,"I discovered Djavan's enticing & entransing music while listening to Jazz living & growing up in Southern Calif. & attending college. This CD is definitely a smart choice for lovers of Brazilian music & world jazz. Djavan is a perfect diamond found among a region of lush beauty & mystery. Tania Maria is another favorite, but let's not get me started going on about her too. I hope you'll be as extremely satisfied with Bird of Paradise as I was when I bought it years ago. I also recommend 'A Twist of Jobime' from the Verve label - they've done a wonderful job there too. Enjoy & Ciao!"
4,Djavan at his best,"This is Brazil's Djavan at his best. The song Miss Suzanna, alone, is worth the price of the c.d. What a wonderful, and distinctive, voice this man has."
4,Excellent Speedloader,This is my first attempt at using a speedloader and this one seems to do the trick easily. I did not have any trouble getting it to function as instructed. With ample practice I should be able to make it work like a pro!!
2,Speedloader,"The HKS Speedloader (36-A) will not work with my Ruger LCR.The speedloader works, just not with the Ruger LCR. My search led me to this item.I can't come up with twenty words to describe this review."
1,"HKS, watch out shooters","These speedloaders are inexpensive and widely available but they are a dismal design. They're easy to load and easy to conceal but they are also VERY EASY to unload themselves, especially when you might need them the most. The turnshaft used to load and release the ammo can be easily turned if in your pocket or elsewhere and the rounds drop out. In addition they do not fit many guns properly. The best revolver speedloaders are the SL Variant ( German and hard to get - try Bobby Macs ) and the 5 Star Firearms loaders. Safarilands are good."
2,Doesn't work well with Ruger SP101 .357,"According to the HKS specs, this is suppose to work with the Ruger Sp101 .357. Unfortunately the stock rubber grips keep the shells from sliding into the cylinder smoothly. You have to twist & shake the loader to get them to drop. Definitely not a ""speed loader"". If you have a Ruger with the factory rubber grips, this is a very poor choice."
3,Plastic and does not fit my S&W .38 featherweight.,Pro'sHolds bullets.In expensive.fast shippingcon'sCheap plasticdoes not fully insert into my S&W; .38 featherweightbullets wobble around worry about them coming dislodged in pocket.
3,Tight fit for S&W Airweight,I bought this for a S&W; a Airweight. it is a VERY tight fit.Recommend QuickStrip 5 round for S&W; Airweight
2,could be good with the right gun,"this does not fit my Rossi very well so I would not say its a speed loader, it does work but has very little room to spare so i'll use it to carry the extra ammo needed as I don't really need the speed thing. most smaller guns need a way to hold the round so that the outter edges of the round are exposed so it not come in contact with the grip. I have a HKS for my 44mag and it works fine"
3,"Speedloader with problems, Must be modified to work!","This speedloader is marketed to work with the Ruger SP101, but it has an issue. My SP101 has a nice set of Pachmyer grips. The back edge of the speedloader would make contact on the grip not allowing the rounds to enter the chamber. Thinking it was a grip issue I removed the Pachmyer grips and re-installed the original grips, and still had the same problem. After re-installing the Pachmyre grips, I showed the SP101 and the speedloader to a friend. He milled the smallest amount off the speedloader so there was no contact with the grip and it now works. I would not recomend this speedloader to anyone with a SP101 unless you know what your doing and are willing to modify it to make it work correctly."
2,Not sure if it's actually 36-a,"I bought an HKS 36-a speed loader from MidwayUSA earlier, and it works and always has worked flawlessly on my sp101(original grips.) When I received this one, supposedly ""36-a"", it didn't go so well. It's obviously different from the 36-a I got from Midway, and the bullet casings jam on the end of the cylinder rather than just sliding in smoothly. That's 15 dollars of practically nonrefundable anxiety."
4,does what it's intended to do,"Using this speedloader is definitely faster than loading rounds one by one, but it takes a little practice. And on my comp0act revolver, it's a pretty tight fit between the loader and the grip, making release a little sticky sometimes."
3,HKS 36A,"Bought this for a Taurus 85. Cartridges are held tight. There is interference with the grip and cylinder release latch, it will work and is faster than loading single cartridges. But not what I would call a speed loader for this model gun"
2,Doesn't work for late model Taurus 85**,It is well made and looks nice. It barely holds the .38 shells without dropping them unless it's just sitting on a table. It does not work for late model Taurus 85. The cylinder release gets in the way and you can only get the bullets in about a half inch or so and release them and hope they fall in. Still faster than manually loading. Haven't decided if I'm going to return yet or not.
3,Nice Product but.....,I bought a HKS 36A (.38 Special/.357) Speed Loader for my Taurus 85 poly protector revolver. This speed loader will not work with this firearm. The Factory grips arm rubberized and very nice but the speed loader becomes jammed between the grips and the cylinder and will not allow the rounds to drop properly in to the cylinder. You can make it work but not like a speed loader should. I will be purchasing the speed loading strips for my poly protector. Hope this help someone else before making this purchase.Revolver: Taurus 85 Poly Protector in .38 SpecialGave three stars because the packaging says it will work with the Taurus model 85 and dosen't over all a nice speed loader and well made just wouldn't work on my revolver.
4,Works for me with 642.,"I've tried this with the Smith 642. Once the tips are in, you cannot get the loader in all the way because it bumps the cylinder release, release and the rounds enter the cylinder. It works for me. It takes 5-6 seconds."
4,Speedloader for S&W 38 snub,Works reasonably well. Some practice is required to effectively align the speed loader with the cylinder (the pistol grip causes some interference).
5,5 shot,"This is a 5 shot speed loader, or atleast the two I recived. however when i went to return the item amazon gave me a refund with no return nessisary. Thanks! I am sure i have a friend who will put them to use."
4,nice,These speed loaders are great. You load them by setting your rounds in the holder and simple turn the screw knob. Works just as I wanted.
4,Good Speedloader For Taurus 851 Concealed Hammer,"I have used these speed loaders for years with a Taurus 851 concealed hammer and stock rubber grips. The rounds go in smoothly, but need a little jiggle to shake them down into the cylinder. They are what they are for the money. A little practice with them and you can get reasonably quick. I have never had a problem with them and I routinely carry two of them loose in a pocket. If you carry them loose in a pocket, make sure to check the pocket you carry them in for lint and foreign matter, as well as the speed loaders. If you want competition fast, this one isn't it. But it is an inexpensive tool for reloading a revolver faster than 1 round at a time."
2,NOT FOR THE LC3 357 W/ HOGUE TAMER GRIPS,"I saw a review stating these fit the LCR 357 with the Hogue Tamer Grips. This is a little misleading. The speedloader will work, but not as intended. You have to adjust the loader angle and drop the bullets in about a third of the way out of the cylinder. It is faster then loading one bullet at a time, but this is not something I would trust to do in a stressful situation. Tactically these speedloaders fail in the LCR 357. I have no experience with other snubbies or j-frames, just reviewing for this specific firearm.Construction and quality of the product are fine. I did more research and found another speedloader brand called Five Star that is reported to work better, I'll put in addition in here if they do work out later.Shipping was also extremely quick."
2,Does Not Fit,"The speedloader seems like a good product in terms of quality and function, but it does not fit my revolver. The website does not specify which models this speedloader does and does not fit. I purchased this speedloader for my standard .38 S&W; Model 442 Airweight. The gun is plain old normal factory specs from the manufacturer, no after market parts, no customization, etc. The speedloader doesn't even feed in half way to the cylinder before it gets stuck. You may want to do some research on this item to fitting your gun before you go through the hassle of ordering and returning.The ad on the website does not provide the information, but now that I have the item in front of me, I can tell you what is says. This item on amazon is for a: HKS Speedloader, model 36-A. The packaging says it fits 5 shot, .38 Special, S&W; models 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 49, 60 // Charter Arms // Taurus 85."
4,Works as expected,It holds the rounds for loading. It really makes loading my revolver easier. Perfect fit for my Charter Arms Bulldog. Not much more to be said.
3,Almost a good speedloader...S&W 637,This is an inexpensive speedloader made for several versions of revolver. This was supposed to fit my S&W 637..and it almost does. Fits into cylinder about 70% but not completly. If you find the correct angle you can get it to work...but this does work...
1,Wrong information,"The HKS Revolver Speedloader Caliber.38.357 does not fit a Ruger Security Six. I retunred the first order and second order as they were both the wrong Speedloader. I got credit for one, but not the other!!! This product is for a 5 round revolver, mine and many others are six round revolvers!"
1,more information please,"i ordered 2 HKS Revolver Speed-loaders with Caliber .38spec. the item description was vague and was not informative enough on the items compatibility. i wanted the 6 shot speed loader for my .38 spec revolver, when my package arrived it was the 5 shot."
1,wrong model,"Its a decent piece of equipment, it just wasn't the right one for a Rossi.357. Mine is a six and this is for a 5 round chamber that's the reason for my low review."
5,Perfect for the price,"This works PERFECT of my S&W .38 Body Guard.. Very happy. I have only had it a few weeks, but a prefect fit. And holds the rounds very well."
2,Did not fit,Did not fit against the rubber grips of my smith and wesson model 60Could not unload the bullets in my chamberLooking now at speed stripsDisappointed
2,Good loader,I had to alter my grip to make this work for me. I have a model 642 with rubber grip. the wood grip models would work unmodified.
5,wrong loader.,It turned out to be the wrong reloader for my Rossi .38 special but it arrived quickly and it was in good condition.
5,As advertised,This product was exactly what was advertised. It holds the rounds tightly in the speed loader. It's easy to turn the knob to release the rounds. Fit my Smith and Wesson Bodyguard M438 perfectly.
5,What I wanted,"Hard to find locally. It looked all over the place, finally found them on line. They work well with my pistol."
4,It Works,"It's OK, seems a bit bulky, but overall allows you to load the cylinder fairly quickly. Rounds load into the speedloader easily and they stay in place securely. Once they are fitted into the cylinder, a simple twist releases them from the speedloader."
5,Nice loader,Nice little product for the money. While I dont normally carry these (I use speed clips) these do what they are designed to do. The only issue I have is in my 357 JHP require a little finesse. Hold tight and releases quickly.
1,Taurus Model 85 poly,"This product does not work well with the Model 85 poly either. It looks as if I would have to cut part of the grip away to allow everything to seat fully. As it is, the loader jams against the grip and isn't easy to remove. Might work well with other model 85 snub nose revolvers, but not the poly model."
3,It works but could be better,"The speedloader works in a CA 357 Mag Pug, but could be better. Slight hang up when loading even with the standard rubber grips on the CA 357 Mag Pug. But, it IS better than trying to load loose rounds and the free shipping made it worth it."
3,HKS 36A on S&W 642,"While the HKS 36A loader is faster than filling one hole at a time, it does not fit the S&W 642 very well. The factory grips hinder quick and easy insertion of the rounds into the cylinder. It works -- but requires a deft touch and considerable reloading practice to use and will not ever be ""speedy"" on the 642."
4,Enjoyable,"Plays are a little outside of my usual purview, but my book club was reading this so I wanted to give it a shot. It's short and sweet, and beautiful in its simplicity. There is a lot of symbolism, and Williams attempted things that really weren't done at the time, such as the use of projected images. There is also a probable autobiographical component to the story. It's not a happy story, but it definitely has something to say. A play I would enjoy seeing in person."
4,How Fragile We Are,"""If all the world's a stage, I want to operate the trap door."" ~Paul BeattyThe Glass Menagerie is a classic play of physical and emotional entrapment. The three members of the Wingfield family are all trapped (the mother by her past and the memory of her husband who left her; the daughter by her overwhelming shyness and lack of confidence; and the son by the overwhelming responsibility of caring for his family in a mind-numbing warehouse job). I believe the play is still popular today because most of us can relate to at least one of their plights. You can't help but pity all the main characters. At times our own psyches are just as fragile as Laura Wingfield's glass menagerie.Somehow, I missed out on this book and play in high school. I am glad I have read the play; now I just need to see it on the stage as it was meant to be seen."
4,a sensitive story about a extaordinary family,"A histerical mother who wants her daughter to get a gentlemancaller as soon as possible. This is the point of the book which at the same time becomes at the same time also a big problem for the whole family. Laura, the daughter, who had broken up high school because of her clumpfoot, is a very shy young woman. She once felt in love with a boy from her chorus at school, Jim. Her brother can organize a date for Laura, inviting a young guy from his ware house.Amanda is as happy as a mother can be. She does all that this evening becomes a succes. When Jim arrives, Laura recognises him with surprise, Jim however doesn't understand. Unfortunately the whole evening doesn't run as Amanda had expected it to be. When Laura hears that Jim already engaged, she again falls back to her depression."
4,Good read,"The Glass Menagerie is a melancolic play, written by Tennessee Williams. The Wingfield's (Amanda with her two children Laura and Tom) live in a shabby apartment of lower middle-class society. Mr.Wingfield left his family many years before because he missed the adventure and therefor escaped from the daily monotony. The hysterical Mrs.Wingfield gets into trouble with the destiny of her two children: Laura who is slightly cripplet with one leg, left school because of her terrible shyness. Her mother wants her to find the perfect gentleman-caller. It fails. Tom works in a factory, dreaming of the adventure as his father did. His mother suspects him to be a drinker. Uncertainty rules among them."
2,Just didn't work.,"As a big fan of Streetcar, I was hoping to try another of T. William's plays hoping to be equally as satisfied. Unfortunately I wasn't. It felt like I was ready a completely different author. The story did have some high points and some of the characters were very well developed. But, overall, I was not satisfied when I came to the end."
3,Glass easily breaks,"I didn't like the book at the beginning. The whole ambiance and especially the behaviour of Amanda seemed very peculiar to me. But then, with time, I started to like the way Tennessee Williams describes the acting of the characters. I like Tom when he's revolting against his mother. And then this horrible Jim shows up....but you're gonna see. I like the title of the book. It fits perfectly. If you like sensible novels, read this one!"
1,great message... not,"This play is one of the many ""classics"" that english teachers and literary critics seem to love; all of these classics have the defining characteristic that they bring out the worst in human nature and undermine the values of hard work, sacrifice, courage, and love. This play can stand right beside ""Death of a Salesman"" as a depressing, pessimistic propaganda on how to deal with life's challenges."
1,A Tragedy to Literature,"I don't care if this play was somehow a foil of Tennessee Williams life, it was the worst ""work"" of ""literature"" I have ever been forced to read for school. I must add that I did read the whole thing and understood it. I took a class on it in ninth grade and got a A on my paper. But this is a story of Tom's pathetically sad life that involves his taking care of his aging mother who can't give up her past and his disabled sister with an unusal attration to glass figurines of animals. This play is filled with symbols, metaphores, and all that jazz, expecting you to feel for the characters and Tom. No, his unenthusiastic approaches at life, and depressed facade turn down any simpathy you feel for him. Amanda the mother is obnoxious, end of story. And Laura the sister is SO helpless you can't help from stopping to want to end her life now. Don't buy the play DON'T DO NOT watch it and never think about it again. Horrible."
4,"""Charm....Vivacity.....and...CHARM!!!!""","For my theatre class we were split up into groups of two and told to pick a scene from a play, so my partner and i picked Scene two from Glass Menagerie. It was my first time to ever read this play and as im reading it i was like oh jeez could this be anymore predictable, but then the end came and i was like......wow that was sooo not what i was expecting.... and about two weeks later when my partner finally finished the play (needless to say she wasnt exactly interested in this assignment) she was also in shock at the climax of this play i highly recomend this book to ppl that have short attention spans (its wicked short) and to those who like surprise endings."
4,Good book,"I had to read this for my 10th grade honors english class. It was a pretty good book, but I was extremely disappointed with the ending. It left me wondering a lot."
5,Good Price,I purchased this play for use in a drama class I was taking. It served the purpose needed for studying and the price was perfect.
3,Broken Minds,"I must say that I've already read better novels. The whole story has too little action for my desires. That kind of review story didn't animate me to read the novel at once. Because you often have to stop and think about what you have read, about the different character and their acting.I normally don't hate, yes I even like, to philosophy but not urgently about these kind of things. Here you HAVE to read the review to understand just the main meaning. I can really imagine that there are a lot of fans of ""The Glass Menagerie "" who just adore this special kind of play."
5,A great movie that deserves a release,"I'll just add to the chorus that this is indeed a great movie, one that's unique and stands out in the vast realm of anime. The animation is gorgeous and the feeling of nostalgia perfectly represented. Unfortunately, I have only seen this movie once, a long time ago, and it is beginning to fade from memory. How could one of ONLY FOUR Takahata movies (with Ghibli) not have been released in the US yet?"
2,The Clydeside revolution betrayed?,"Gallacher's book, while being an insiders account of the Clyde Workers' Committee, is unfortunately coloured by his own interpretation of events and his exaggerated role in them.Self-glorification might be ""acceptable"" if he was not also taking this opportunity to savagely attack the legacy of the Clyde's true working-class hero, John Maclean. Then again, opportunism was nothing unusual for Gallacher...Anyone reading this book would be advised to weigh it against Maclean's own account of the Clyde workers and Gallacher's role by referring to Maclean's 'Open Letter to Lenin'"
1,very poor material,i bought this and wore it twice and it's all tarnished and cheap looking. never again on this one. Usually i am very satisified with Amazon but this one is bad.
2,Finger Strength Exercises Are Not A Breakthrough,"The author subscribes to the finger strength school of piano playing technique and gives about 90 pages of photos and exercises for strengthening fingers. Any pianist who has found that finger strength is not the basis for piano technique might be dismayed with the author's approach.However the book also includes a couple brief, well organized chapters not related to finger exercises: one on Memorization, another on specific ways to optimize your practice time.Even though I do not agree with the author's premise that every clean downstroke of a finger is preceded by a preparatory upstroke (in fact that statement seems absurd if you watch a lot of pianists play the piano), his book has forced me to think very clearly about how I want to teach piano technique to beginners."
3,Interesting,"At times, Merton is hard to understand. His esoteric thinking was above me. For those who are fans, its good."
4,Solid debut album from talented but underrated singer,"Remembered nowadays almost exclusively for her hit anti-drug anthem ""Toy Soldiers,"" Martika (born Marta Marrero on 5-18-69 in Cuba) is a solid talent nonetheless, with a strong passionate voice and slick polished production. Though ""Toy Soldiers"" is a slow, lilting song, this album also contains some vibrant, energetic dance-pop numbers, such as ""You Got Me Into This,"" and ""It's Not What You're Doing."" She also pumps some welcome energy into Carole King's classic hit ""I Feel The Earth Move."" Her follow-up album, 1991's ""Martika's Kitchen"" didn't spawn anything quite as memorable as ""Toy Soldiers,"" but still has much of the solid, assured feel that this album does."
3,Martika,"I have searched for years for the single Toy Soldiers by Martika in record shops to no avail, eventually I found her album with the song included....it was great to go back down memory lane to those great years!"
4,"Martika is great, the seller event greater",talk about fast delivery -- and via the USPS too.as far as the Martika album itself -- I have long sought to add this to my collection -- I had actually downloaded it from iTunes and it turns out I am limited to only 6 devices with it AND I have to register each device with iTunes to boot --- and I cannot order additional liscenses through them to play it on all my different mp-3 players or home stereo or various devices.I am back to the idea that I will simply use the basic CD tech so I can listen to the music where I want and when I want.Too bad Martika isn't getting back to the basics too -- she just has a awsome sound.
3,Not just a 1 hit wonder!,"People this girls been around since she was a little girl! If I recall she was a cast memeber on Kid's Incorporated, I tthink Allanis morrisette, jennifer love hewitt, and people like that came off of that show, it's was like mickey mouse clubs competition, Anyway Toy Soldier is a biography, appearently she lived a very Drew Barrymore type of childhood, as in strung on cola at 12 years old, anyways thought id put my 2 cents in as well as I remember, Toy Soldier is Next to perfect, cant say that for the rest of the album though,"
3,Good songs and Flaws,"The 1988 ""Martika"" album can b described as a mix bag. The Cuban born California raised singer with that cherry voice was somwhat a victim of the primitive side of the big dance music field. Almost ridiculous are songs like ""If u are Tarzan I'm Jane"", ""It's not what u are doing"", ""See if I care"" and ""Alibis"". These songs are not really worth to be sung by Martika. That Martika has talent and that there are songs that really fit her style is obvious if u listen to the lovely ballad ""Toy Soldiers"" and the truly catchy dance songs like ""Cross My Heart""'and ""More than U KNow""."
5,Just as awesome as Winger's first two albums!,"Winger is one of the GREATEST hair metal bands ever and this CD is just as awesome as ""Winger"" and ""In The Heart Of The Young!"" Anyone would be a fool NOT to listen to this CD or any other of Winger's albums! Winger totally ROCKS!!!!The best song on here is called Spell I'm Under! Totally Winger! My favorite next to Miles Away and Headed For A Heartbreak! These Metal Ballads just have a special magic that these so called ""ballads"" of today's bands just don't have!I love this whole album and it's just as WINGER as any of their other albums! It doesn't stray too far and totally sounds like them!Another song that ROCKS is Down Incognito. I love this rocker! The music itself is awesome!Blind Revolution Mad is another great rock song!Actually ALL of Winger's CD's kick ass and ROCK!!! Get the whole Winger collection, you will NOT regret it!!!!"
3,OK so far...,"We bought this online on Amazon for my 5-year-old nephew for Christmas -- haven't tested it on him yet, but we have met with a two concerns right off the bat:- no AC adapter included in this package (it does state this on the website if you look under the specs). You can buy one separately for $17.95 on Amazon, or buy the keyboard with the accessories package for another $30 more, but with a stand and headphones too.- it arrived at our door in the original Casio box, illustrated and all, packing label stuck to the box. Am actually surprised that no one stole it before we got home.After stocking up on the 6 AA batteries it requires, it seems to be working well. Now we have to go order the plug!"
4,A Bulls Eye for the $,"A wonderful starting place for any age and the price cannot be beat. This product has more bells and whistles then I ever wanted or will use. The sound is a little parochial, tiny, and less professional than what I wanted. Here is a product that for the money exceeds all expectations. However, that being said for the money I wish I had paid $200 more and jumped up a class. Missing feature that I didn't look for before purchase was the ability to record our (or play in from) an external source like USB. Something I quickly learned that I needed, which is not a the fault of Casio. My kids will cherish it though until they get to my discriminating tastes and age."
3,Not so great,"First of all, the score on which this recording is based (published by Sikorski in 1997) is flawed, so one cannot trust this as an accurate source for the film music--original or what is actually heard in the film itself. Secondly, the performance is so-so. The orchestra didn't play with much passion, and the choral pieces (Russian Orthodox hymns) are completely life- and expression-less. Nevertheless, it's the only recording out there that approximates what's heard in the film, and what was censored. For that reason I gave it a 3 and not a 2 or 1."
3,revealing,"I am a big fan of the ""law of attraction"" and such and when I read these older books it lets me know that the current Gurus of the law of attraction are really not coming up with anything new. Good old information."
1,big disappointment,"I already had a SanDisk 1 GB flashdrive. However this 2 GB with U3 technology is full of problems. I checked the manufacturer's website, and it listed 20 error messages and possible solutions."
1,"SOFTWARE, NOT HARDWARE??","ZERO STARSBEWARE: SAN DISK THINKS ITS A SOFTWARE COMPANYI purchased two San Disk Flash Drives with U3 installed. Package mentions the U3 in TINY print (THOUGHT I WAS BUYING A FLASH DRIVE!!). Want to use it as a flash drive, you HAVE to UNINSTALL the software. However, at the San Disk website, it only allows you to remove ONE copy of U3 regardless of owning two Flash Drives.Think buying a car with a ""special radio"" installed... only you can't change the station, can't change the BLARING volume, and can't turn it off... did you buy a car or the radio?I suggest you FIND ANY OTHER BRAND... AND AVOID THIS TURKEY..."
1,"One Star, Should Be No Stars","I have two of these pieces of junk. One of them has messed up two PCs. Had I known that these items come with some ridiculous software on them, I would never have purchased them. I will never buy any SanDisk item again. I went back to my trusty Memorex and no problems."
5,A wonderfully cynical look at life.,"Fran Lebowitz has a wonderfully dry and irreverent way of looking at life; this is a favorite of mine and I recommend it. You don't have to be a New Yorker or even a city dweller to enjoy it, but a cynical outlook and no reverence whatever will help a lot."
2,Metropolitan Life,I thought I must have missed something with this book. What was the or is the big deal? Is the book some kind of revelation about the emerging cultures of New York in the late 60's and early 70's? The entire reading experience was a big blah. Perhaps I have become too jaded in 2011. I liked the Scorcese film very much. Metropolitan Life not so much.
3,bluesy Aretha,"I bought this CD for one track, which I recall being played on WABX FM here in Detroit. ""Just Right Tonight."" Billy Preston is on piano and it is BAD!!!!!!!!!! Aretha can sing! Some other good tunes, but worth it for this one lengthy blues tune-the highlight!"
3,Certainly the Other Side of Aretha's Sky!,"I have to agree with some of the common criticisms of this CD. It is entirely unfocused. I love the ""flower child"" words and melody of the title track. I think Mr. Spain is absolutely the best song on the CD and one of Aretha's best vocal accomplishments. Unlike reviews I have read about That's The Way I Feel About Cha, I absolutely love this song and I play it over and over and over and over again. Angel and Master of Eyes are of course emotively amazing.From the 4 songs written by Franklin to the fantastic piano solos she performed to her amazing ability to conture her vocals emotively amongst a range of tunes, Aretha did delivery! Although unfocused, this CD was ahead of its time and a must have for Aretha Franklin fans and anyone interested in learning why Aretha is the Queen of all music!"
5,One of her best,I love this album. Every single note on it. Angel saved my life. That's the way... kills me everytime I hear it. Who else would be able to open their heart and soul as she does in this song?. Get it and listen often. YYou'll be addicted.
2,The beginning of the end,Aretha's most productive period was between about 1967 to 1971. This is an unfocused album--not representative of her best years. So Swell When You're Well is an absolute masterpiece and is worth the cost of the disk. For completists.
5,Inspirational,I think this book is great. It really enhanced me spiritually and got me back in touch. I recommend everyone to get it if this is your thing
4,Wiss 29N Industrial Shears/Scissors,Fast delivery and the scissors are excellent. I highly recommend these for use when you want to make precision cuts of any type.
1,Wiss Scissors,"I was VERY disappointed with my purchase of the Wiss scissors. They are soooo tight, it's nearly impossible to get them open to cut anything. I wanted to return them but I didn't want to go through all the hassle Amazon requires. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO ANYONE!!!!!!!!"
2,Big disappointment after enjoying the film....,"Whenever I enjoy a movie based on a successful book, I am excited to give the original a read. It's usually better! PRINCE OF TIDES...OF HUMAN BONDAGES...and many others.Unfortunately, that wasn't the case for me with this one. Especially as a fan of historical fiction, I'd been looking forward to an engrossing thriller but I was tremendously disappointed. It just couldn't hold my attention.I suspect this is a case where it would have been better to read the book first!"
5,Thank you Mr. Asiner,"Would someone please explain to Mr. Asiner that the point of a review is to give one's opinion as to whether or not the book is good; not to give away ever single bit of the plot, including the ending! No reason to buy this book now after reading his ""review"". I bet the author and publisher are happy about that."
3,dvds are lacking,i am a fan and have been for a long time. i do enjoy owning them on dvd but the dvd lacks a lot. could use more special features and i would have enjoyed a box set much more. too bad amazon and a lot of places dont carry these dvds anymore because i know of lots of people looking for them and they are envious of my small stack that keeps growing among my collection of dvds.
1,My review: Vol. 1,"Let me start this review off by saying I really enjoyed this show as a child and..Well that's it for this Volume, I'll continue it on Volume 2.Get it Paramount?"
1,Glad I read the reviews before clicking on buy,"I almost bought this but decided to read the reviews first. I am so glad I did, I would have been mad as heck had I got the video just to find out it had been altered. If I order an old TV show I want just that, not some new colorized, new soundtrack version. THEY ARE CALLED CLASSICS FOR A REASON PEOPLE, LEAVE THEM ALONE."
1,CBS/Paramount Shame On You!!,"Just like many other baby boomers, I would love to own My Three Sons on DVD. However, especially with the economy being what it is, there is no way I can afford to spend a fortune to own it. Another case of the big guy being greedy and not listening to the consumer. Personally, I think CBS/Paramount better be careful. What goes around, comes around. You are going to lose in the long run if you do not listen to the consumer.Sorry guys, I am passing on this unless it is released as a complete season at a reasonable price."
1,CBS / PARAMOUNT....LISTEN UP!!!!!!,"OK....I WAS THE FOOL, I BOUGHT VOL.1 OF SEASON ONE. BUT AFTER READING THESE REVIEWS, I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND ABOUT PURCHASING VOL.2....THERE IS POWER IN NUMBERS!!!!!!!UNLESS YOU CUT THE PRICE IN HALF TO MAKE UP FOR STEALING MY MONEY THE FIRST TIME AROUND......PRINT ONE LESS COPY OF VOL.2.....MINE!!!!!"
4,Was issue about the music resolved????,"BULLETIN...BULLETIN...BULLETIN. IMPORTANT: Here are the facts, as of 10/24/2011. Has ABC/Paramount cleaned up their act? Looks like it. I just watched the 1st episode from Disc One, Season One of this series. The music was dead-on accurate. It had the correct title music and the correct music for the ending credits, and I didn't hear any ""altered new background music"" in the body of the show. I'm a fairly reliable cultural historian of things occurring during my childhood (I was 14 when this series debuted). While I don't claim to be of ""Trekkie""-level extremism when it comes to 'My Three Sons', I swear that that IF the original music was removed (acccording to reviews from recent years), it's back and correct now! I'll be interested to see what other's current observations are.I'll update this review if I find that subsequent episodes from Disc One, Season One have the original music replaced or altered."
1,SO DISAPOINTED,"Wow, I have been waiting for this to be released for ever... And now its released in volumes??? I DONT THINK SO! I do love this show but will not be purchasing any until full seasons are available.. PLEASE.. DONT WASTE MY TIME!! I WILL NOT BUY!! PLEASE, if you read this DON'T BUY EITHER.."
1,"Like watching ""The Nutcracker Suite"" set to AC/DC music.","Would you watch the Nutcracker Suite with your kid for Christmas if it were set to ""Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap?"" No...unless you were a nut. Since I'm not one, I won't partake in this charade of a DVD since it's gotten all the music replaced with some forgery and fraud of a music background. Also, the attempt to rip me off by splitting seasons up with the sole purpose of a CASH GRAB to make more money, Paramount won't get a dime off me on this.As for the series itself, I never really liked it anyway except it was safe ""white bread"" entertainment for the masses with easy to follow stories. I've got a daughter and she doesn't like all the ""boy"" stuff anyway. I always thought ""Uncle Charlie"" was simply annoying and if he were my uncle, I'd have had him thrown out on his ear...but that's me.Don't buy this rubbish. Wait for the series to be done right. Even I might get it if they did that. Not this way. Not if h3ll froze over."
1,I've Waited Too Long To Settle For Less Than An Unedited DVD,"I've waited too long to settle for anything less than an unedited dvd set. Shame on CBS/Paramount. I truly have been waiting for the release of this series for no less than 5 years. I was thrilled when I saw it listed on Amazon and very disappointed when I realized that CBS/Paramount has decided to hold the unedited version hostage. I was too young at the time the black/white episodes aired to remember those, but I do remember watching and enjoying the color episodes. I have approximately 20 color episodes recorded on VHS from reruns shown several years ago. I suppose I will have to be satisfied with those few episodes because I WILL NOT give in to this hostage situation."
1,Music Changed - Be Informed Before Buying CBS/Paramount DVDs,Music Changed - Be Informed Before Buying CBS/Paramount DVDs.I have stopped pre-ordering CBS/Paramount DVDs until confirming they havn't been butchered.
1,My 3 sons,"Hi,I read the reviews on The DVD's and will now not purchase the product based on what I have read. I want the original series - unaltered, with the original music. Thanks for the information about the product.How do we contact Paramount about this?Leslie BairdMy 3 son's fan"
2,"My Three Sons Season 1, Vol. 1","Where can I get my money back? As a hearing-impaired person, I find the sound ""muffled"" and erratic. Also, for this type of price for only 1/2 of the season seems unreasonable and not worth it."
3,Great show Poor Pricing,"I truly agree with most of the sentiment here. This is way overpriced for a half hour sitcom that only constitutes a half season. I'll just wait till they drop the price to under twenty bucks. I love the show too and it brings back great memories of my childhood. But, I can wait till Paramount comes to thier senses (or Amazon has a huge sale). If you add the cost of both season 1 volumes together the MSRP is $80.00!! Outrageous!"
1,You just have to start drawing the line somewhere,"Frankly, I had looked forward to obtaining this series but I have to take a pass. Sooner or later you have to quit being an idiot and stop giving in to corporate greed and that's what it is when they release half seasons at top dollar, not to mention changing the music and editing it to boot. It is nothing more than raking consumers who think they absolutely have to have it for as much as they can get. Yes, Paramount continues to play the part of P.T. Barnum.But you must ask yourself as to whether or not having My Three Sons actually affect your life? No, but it will affect your pocketbook and continue to do so if you continue to fill the coffers of Paramount and buying their edited overpriced slop. Sorry, but I won't be buying."
1,Great Show ... Greedy Distributors,I echo what many people have been saying. Why these shows are distributed in half season sets is shameful to the public. In fact there were not even royalties involved from shows that are so old . This is a huge slap in the face at the average person. To do this to us is criminal. Saturday Night Live was an Hour and half and their shows are released in entirety at a fairly reasonable price ... high 30s low 40s. If Saturday Night Live can do it than surely this company can. Don't fret fellow My Three Sons fans. Most of these volume sets end up in Amazons special sale section in shorter time than you think.
5,my three sons was a major sitcom,the show ran 12 years [1960 thru 1972] and the 1st five years its was the top sitcom. i don't understand why its not on dvd yet. it's one of the best sitcoms ever produced and it should have been one of the 1st on dvd.
5,"My Three Sons: The Complete First Season, Vol. 1","Love it, can't say enough about it. To bad life is not like it used to be, especially TV today."
5,Season 1 Looks Great,"I love these DVD's. I don't remember watching these as a kid so if anything is missing I can't tell, but the image quality is great and I am thoroughly enjoying the series. I already bought volume 2 and am looking forward to purchasing future releases."
1,CBS Paramount do dirt,"Well from reviews I see this product is very substantially altered from the original. Who wants cherished episodes of favorite TV shows with the soundtracks ALTERED! That really is a absolute cheat. I went to Amazon today as I just saw Don Grady has just passed away. I so remember his character as my favorite. I was going to purchase what I hoped I would find, a COMPLETE series! But no, they dumped half seasons, with altered soundtracks on the market. No thanks. A real RIP OFF!"
1,30 min shows should not be released in two Volumes,"SHAME ON YOU Paramount!!! What's the idea of cheating us with Vol 1 of MY THREE SONS when it is only a 1/2 hr show??? Throw the season in one volume only and charge a little more. You have many customers who want all 12 seasons of this beloved show, but in COMPLETE SEASONS only. Reconsider before you lose me and many more as a sure customer of this show."
1,PARAMOUNT - UP TO IT'S TRICKS AGAIN,"I was looking forward to buying the entire first season of My Three Sons as it originally aired, until I found out it was Paramount up to old tricks yet again, like changing the music (how could they take out the DeVol's score for this show. It's like having pancakes without the syrup), then also releasing half season sets for the price of what a whole season should cost. That's SHAMEFUL and GREEDY of Paramount.DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT PEOPLE, YOU'RE BEING GYPED!I was also looking forward to buying the first season because I only saw the color episodes when I was a kid. I guess I'll be hanging on to those half dozen Columbia House videos I have with the complete and UNEDITED showsPARAMOUNT, YOU'RE A BIG JOKE. Shame on you you're not getting my money!"
1,"My Three Sons, First Season, Vol. 1","If you buy this, you are showing the producers of these dvds that you will buy anything. This is nothing like the shows. The music is not there, the episodes are chopped up, it is NOT what you think you are getting when you are laying down your money. If enough people would have complained and boycotted buying it ... they would have had to do it right. I say let the stores send them all back and show them that the consumers have brains and know what they want to spend their hard earned money on."
4,Fun Sci Fi that also teaches,Great book for introducing philosophy and ancient Greek culture to folks who would not normally read about such topics. Alford's storyline and plot twists keep the reader interested throughout. Excellent for students. Looking forward to his next book!
1,A Christian tract,"The time travel concept of this book was good, although the writing was stiff (obviously the author's first novel with all the inherent shortcomings). The story was okay until it became obvious that this was written to advance a very Christian point of view. I don't mind a little religion, but this was preachy and too obvious. In parts it read like a tract that folks hand out when they are standing on your doorstep. And of course the author totally ignores the time travel paradox at the end -- if the inventor of time travel is removed by time travelers, how can time travel have been invented for them to do so? -- explaining it to have been God's will to have worked it all out. (I guess that's the ultimate deus ex machina!) Skip this one for a lot better works by Jack Finney and Jack McDevitt."
5,Excellent product,"This is a marvelous speed loader for my 38 revolver. However, I changed the original grips, which are a bit wider and it makes it a little harder to use the loader. Not the loaders fault. It works perfectly. I would buy this product again."
5,I Ordered two for my for revolver.,"These fit perfect for Colt King Cobra. I love it and, they work really well with my revolver. I got my order in like three days. And price is so very good. Thank You. Kevin Hidalgo."
3,A different way,More like a gadget than useful. You have to hold it just right to release the cartridges into the cylinder.Loadind by hand may be just as fast.
2,"""sticky"" not a smooth operation..","Hello, Yes I shopped the market until I found speed loaders that my fit .38 Colt Detective Special. I received them with no delay and proceeded to the shooting range to try out my new product. I loaded the speed loaders and started to get ready to use them and as I did I noticed it was quite difficult to get the bullets to drop into the cylinder. I had to ""wiggle and twist"" the speed loader in several directions in order for the ammo to drop.They act as anything but a ""speed loader.""I don't really know what to do..as they are the correct loaders for the gun. They do work, but not as I had hoped or expected.Sincerely, I'm looking for an answer !"
4,"No problem with product, type of grips must be considered.","Purchased for Armscor 206, fit is good but it depends on the thickness of the grips installed on the revolver. The projectile and about 1/4"" of the casing will match up with a Pachmayer grip but you must let the rounds drop into place."
5,Works great with Armscor M206,"This works perfectly with the Armscor M206. I strongly recommend purchasing this product for anyone who owns a Colt D model or cloned revolver, the reloading time for revolvers needs to be at a minimum. I even installed a Pachmayr grip on the Armscor and it doesn't get in the way either. I'm going to be buying more of these soon."
4,Not Ideal for Colt Detective Special with Full-Size Grip,"HKS makes a quality speedloader, and has for a while. Their products are well-made and generally work as advertised. In the past I've used LCR and Smith & Wesson Model 637 speedloaders with no issue.I bought this loader for my 1968-manufactured unshrouded second-generation Colt Detective Special with the full-size factory wood grips. The loader won't seat completely due to the grip. I can still drop the rounds at a slight angle and it is workable, but given that this loader is listed as compatible with the Colt, the fact that it doesn't work with factory grips is unacceptable.Four stars for quality, minus one for not working well with a revolver it was advertised to work with."
3,One out of four ain't bad,"I bought four of these scents, this is the only one that doesn't change it's character as the day wears on...actually smells like what it says it does..."
4,Excellent,"Very good choice of topics. Clear presentation. Caters to a wide variety of audiences.I'd give it a 5 if it included a chapter devoted practical aspects of experimental light scattering measurements, techniques, and instrumentation."
4,A must for any photographer,"If you like me, like to play with digital images and get those pretty good photos to be really great photos then I think this book cannot be beat. It is packed with step-by-step instructions on how to make the eyes whiter, remove facial blemishes etc. The examples are good and the images that Scott references are on his website, so happy downloading. I especially liked Scott's approach to black and white photos, after using the book you will never use Elements basic ""Remove Color"" command again!The book is well laid out and you can just go to the appropriate instruction section without having to refer back to prior chapters.So why not 5 stars? Well I think there could be more done for the advanced elements user. Discussing how to do multi-layer masks for one would be nice. But it is well worth the money!I would consider myself an intermediate elements user."
3,buy the video instead.,it's hard to read this book then do it on the computer. it is better to buy the video tutorial which is easier to follow and isfaster to understand. some of the topics being discussed here are already outdated.
5,The American Heritage Picture History of WWII,Historically important for your library if interested in Pictures of History / WWIIvery well done. Very interesting
5,Sculpture Book,Book condition was excellent - exactly as described. It should be a big help with my hobby.
5,Lovely Puppet,"Ok, maybe not lovely, how about super fierce and awesome? Really a great puppet, pretty big and made to last."
5,An instant favorite.,"With four kids, we've collected an abundance of toys over the years, but, this was one of our first nice puppets and I'm very impressed. It's perfect for my four-year-old son. He can maneuver the mouth or the arms, but, not both at the same time (it would actually be kind of hard for an adult to do both at the same time, unless you have rather large hands). No matter. The arms are great for hugs and the mouth is great for roars and tickle fights. It is soft, durable, and, perhaps my favorite part is the beautiful, colorful fabric with texture and shiny scales. It's perfect for cuddling with at bedtime and it has instigated interesting interactions with our son. I imagine we will collect more puppets, but, this one will remain a favorite and I would highly recommend it for young children who love dinosaurs."
2,Maybe I had too high expectations...,"... but this book was a let down for me. Almost each and every story was poorly written and I could not really ""feel"" for the stories the way that I wanted to and the way that I think these animals ""deserve"". It was mostly ""... and then this happened, and then that and then that and now we are happy together...""Could have been a much better book in my opinion!"
5,Heart warming,This book truly captures the joy of adopting a rescue dog and the essence of dog ownership. The stories are beautiful and will touch your heart. As I read each story I found one similarity among the dogs and the people they found; both owners and dogs were appreciative and truly expressed how blessed they were to have found each other. I have 2 rescue dogs and 3 rescue cats and they all have brought so much joy to my life. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
5,goD's dogs win in this one!,"rockysfunddogrsq - Author of Dogs' Letters to goD: Rescued Dogs Talk to the Creator (available here on Amazon). As an active member of the dog rescue community, this book made my heart soar with hope for our beloved canine companions and with pride in the people who chose the adoption option when searching for a companion. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. The photos are excellent and touch the heart. The text is uplifting, but does not spare the reader from the sometimes harrowing and heartrending circumstances that lead to these ""second chances"". A must read!"
3,Great stories,"The dogs' stories are very moving and inspirational, but anytime you have a book that takes stories from multiple people, there are always going to be some that just aren't that well written. I felt like that took away from the impact of the book."
2,Needs Professional Proof reading.,"Just received 'The All-American Five Radio'.This book is riddled with Typos, not just missing a letter here or there,but calling the term Pi...pie, calling a Sine wave...a Sign wave, etc.In the very first chapter there is an equation demonstrating Ohms Law,the answer given is wrong. The book gives the answer 135 by multiplication, the answer is 60 by Division! The equation just below it has the right answer but the fraction has the values in the wrong position. This on just a brief look at the book so far. Many of the definitions in the back are bad or just plain wrong. Not sure what to trust in this book. The concept is good; could have been better written for a learning manual, especially about electric and Radio. My personal opinion is that anyone giving this book a top five star rating just doesn't get it or they are associated with book somehow,,,this is suppose to be a how to learning manual, understand?"
2,Poor presentation,Very basic ... too basic! Lacking practical experience of the design and repair of AA5 radios. Anyone who does not understand AC and DC basics should not mess with radios.
5,Love it,"Only need a little bit, it goes a long way.. works, tightens and I noticed a difference in a few days. saw it on Dr Oz and tried it.... I am a HUGE reader of reviews before I buy things and that was the reason I tried it"
4,Good product,"Seems expensive for so little, but you literally only need a drop....my last bottle lasted nearly a year and I use it 2x/day. Keep skin around eyes and lips very soft, and not new wrinkles have appeared!"
4,Good Quality / Well Priced,"My skin always looks its best when using the Glycolix line on my combination skin for the last 3 years. I have tried many more expensive lines, but always come back to the Glycolix line. My dermatologist originally recommended it to me. I use the cleanser, facial cream and eye serum on my 49 year young skin. In the winter time I sometimes need extra moisturizer around my eyes."
4,Super Serum!,I read about this product and decided to give it a try. I have puffiness around my eyes and use this every morning. It is helping to reduce the puffiness and also is very gentle and moisterizing around the eye.
3,Could have been better and more clear,"This book was given to me as a gift by my parents. They had read ""The Forgotten Beasts of Eld"" and thought that I would really enjoy this book. It wasn't bad, and I like a lot of the writing style. However, I found the ending muddled and confusing. I think this book would have been worlds better if it had been more clearly resolved. I would recommend reading it, but prepare yourself for a final sequence that makes very little sense."
3,"Certainly does drag a bit, doesn't it?","I loved the ending, but maybe that's just because it took me months to read the middle. I was very excited that it was almost over. I knew who was who (except for one little bit that wasn't nearly as important as the book thought it was), I knew who was going to find who and where they would end up ... yet the book would just keep going, and going, and going. There's only so much description of pot-scrubbing one person can take."
3,Good Basic Review,"Good review of urology and urodynamics, I was looking for a more straightforward guide on multichannel urodynamics. Also seems to present more of an English perspective that may differ slightly from American medicine."
4,Very nice little book.,"Wow, did this book cost so much money? I must of forgot. In the end, even given the cost of this thin little book, I think it does a very nice job going over the topic. It is a quick read and hits the big topics and may be a nice thing to have if you are a urology resident or someone reading for the boards."
4,Leave-in conditioner,"My girlfriend uses this. I bought it for her. She has tried several other conditioners to calm her wavy, frizzy hair. She says it has made her hair softer. It's a little lighter and less greasy. She likes the fragrance."
4,Better than shampoo built in conditioners,"I used a shampoo that had a built in conditioner,but my hair still seemed to be fly away. This provides great conditioner, but be careful not to over apply it."
4,my first leave in conditioner,"i've never used leave-in conditioners before, so i have nothing to compare this one to. but here are my thoughts:1. it's not as softening as an in shower conditioner that you rinse off. when i try to run my fingers thru my long hair after putting it on, my fingers get all stuck and i pull a ton of hair out2. it's not really that thickening or volumizing, but i've always used volumizing conditioner.3. it smells hecka good"
5,Out With The Straw; In With Silky Strands,"My nearly 40 year old head of hair has been getting drier and coarser at the ends every year despite regular trims, expensive salon shampoos and conditioners, and no chemical treatments. I've tried a plethora of products and found a few that keep it tolerably attractive, but THIS is the first one that really took it all the way to silky. It looks so very good now."
1,Like Using WATER,I just recently opened this bottle to begin using it.I squeezed a little out into my palm it came rushing out. It has the consistency of water. It's as if whoever I bought this from actually loaded a nearly empty bottle of the product with tap water and then sold it to me. It smells like the right stuff but it is DEFINITELY NOT the product I have paid for. It's been too long for me to get my money back but I will NEVER order from this dealer again and STRONGLY advise others to steer clear!!!
5,This stuff is great!,"I have very fine hair, I have a good amount but still very fine. I always have to use product to get any sort of volume. I have had this for about 2 weeks now and I use it every single day along with a root lifter by redken and my hair has a lot of natural looking body. It doesnt fall by the end of the day and it doesnt make my hair greasy or feel dirty. I use it maybe 1 or 2 days in a row before washing and the second day of wearing it my hair looks even more full. And its great that its only 15 dollars on amazon, I'm sure a product like this cost a bit more in stores. Thanks amazon!"
3,Not that great,"I was expecting my hair to be fuller, not greasy. I am kind of disappointed because of all the good reviews I saw on here. O'well lesson learned."
1,Didn't do anything,"After all the good reviews I read on here, I thought I'd buy this hoping that it would make my hair look thicker and give it volume. It did neither of those things, and in fact, it seemed to make my hair frizzy and greasy. I would not buy this again, that's for sure. Save your money."
5,This is the best,"I have thinning hair and after I used this conditioner, my hair feels thick and voluminous. I have keep using it."
3,"Good for volumizing, poor for detangling","The product leaves my hair fuller, smoother, shinier which is great. Unfortunately it does not work at all as a detangler."
4,ugh,not happy nor upset when i had picked it had a different picture so i didnt get the cd i really wanted but on the plus it was still MJ so how mad can you really be
2,Make a Careful Selection,"Purchased the HP190 1 wk ago basically on the strength of my strong previous experience with their printers. Found immediately that the machine doesn't copy any original larger than letter size...(my own fault), but then also found that it truncated my documents and left off the last line on a letter page and in my case, a crucial line. Shouldn't a copier that has a setting for 8 1/2"" x 11"" actually copy that size? I thought so too, and returned it for a Xerox XD100 which is a WIZ machine. I lose the color capability, but have about the best copy you can get anywhere!"
1,don't bother,"The print quality is good but everything else stinks. It doesn't print legal nor does it print full letter (it crops the letter unless you scale it down to 91%). Everytime you go to copy it always has to ""warm up"" (for an inkjet??) which takes about 30 seconds. So if you want to just be able to make a quick copy...forget it. It also has a nasty tendenacy to paper jam, especially when doing multiple copies."
4,nice sweatshirt,"Not much one can say about a sweatshirt. I like the sweatshirt I bought, just think it was a bit overpriced. I obviously knew that when I bought it, and I chose to buy it anyway."
1,Not Good,I purchased this as a giftfor my sister. She opened it and said it had no fragence at all. I was upset and embarassed that this happened. This was my first attempt to order on line and I will not do it again.
1,are these the Original Artists???,Are these a re-makes? Covers of popular songs by studio sound-alikes? They don't sound right to me (not like the arrangements and vocals of the 45 rpm's of these hits)
4,Better Sex - satusfying her,"Although the DVD had a bit of lecture and the photography was not what men would call terribly erotic, we watched it together, and were able to laugh and fast foreward thru most of the talking. My wife enjoyed the style of the photography and the scenes. Also after watching it together, she was much more open about what pleased her, and that, although seeming an indirect result, has helped our sex life. Based on those results alone we highly recommend it. Also it led us to the candida roylae videos available in adult stores, she enjoyed these a lot too.(and they are not bad from a guys viewpoint either.)"
1,Worst of the 25 in the series,"This is the worst of the 25 movies in the Carry On series. It is worst by a wide margin. They repeat a limited number of Three Stooges type gags to fill out the 90 minutes. If you are not a veteran, you will not appreciate most of the limited humor. It does not even have the sexual content of most Carry on movies. The overweight and shapeless women are very bland and wear shapeless uniforms.There is a serious technical flaw. The audio is recorded at a very low level. You will have to turn your television volume to full on to get even a low sound level out of the speakers."
4,useful for the class,The book arrived in very good condition. Useful for this class but I do not think I would read it beyond that.
3,So so,"It works as a writing textbook, but thats still what it is, and that leads to quite a bit of boredom."
2,Not as Shown,"I also ordered this believing the picture was an accurate representation of the product being sold, as I would about all the other pictures of products on the Amazon.com web site. I ordered 4 place settings which are arriving separately and now will have to send them back because they are not as the picture shows. Please change the picture to be accurate!"
2,Jeepers,"Jeepers (shudders) ....that about sums up how you feel after completing the new Right Said Fred album ""For Sale"". This album is far below par when compared with his previous works. Some songs are pretty standard Fred and aren't too horribley bad but some just reek. Id say that Fred is now about equal with or less sexy than his shirt. Its a big dispointment don't purcahse this album unless you are a die hard Fred fan."
2,Definitely a Disappointment,"Sad to say (especially since I am a long time RSF fan), but this CD is dull and lifeless. Whereas RSF songs are usually creative, quirky, interesting and fun, most of this CD is slow and flat. There are a few stand outs (Love Pressure & Jump Start), the rest are just silly, as if RSF is running out of creative steam. Hopefully the boys will make a triumphant comeback with the next one.....These guys have been pumping out great (though overlooked) CD's for years. I give them this one slip up....but don't do it again!"
2,Most of his lessons are apparently learned the easy way...,"For insight into Gingrich, one should skip this book and instead read his extensive set of Amazon reviews. Yes -- Newt Gingrich writes lots of reviews on Amazon! And not a single pan! Everything gets four stars or more, suggesting that Newt may be burdened by a seriously unsceptical mind.And it's not all Toffler and Deming. He reads novels, history, and science books, and seems to have a military fetish. The reviews are generally well-written and useful, but Gingrich may overestimate the importance of books. On Kissinger's ""Does America Need a Foreign Policy?"" he writes, ""This is a book the Bush Administration can use for sophisticated planning."" I can just see Dubya, Cheney and Condy huddled over a dog-eared copy of Kissinger's book, marking up their map of geopolitical chessboard."
2,Read Molinari's chapter on Newt first,"Before you get caught up with Newt's rhetoric, get Susan Molinari's book Representative Mom and read the chapter on Newt."
5,The Morel bible !,"I have hunted The mighty MOREL (KING of the SPRING) for over 60 years all over the state of Michigan. Several friends have asked me for advice as they got started, so I bought this book for them to borrow and read. This certainly did reduce the number of questions I had to answer over and over. The book is well written and accurate. There is perhaps too much information, but it certainly covers all the bases. I highly recommend this book whether you are a beginning morel hunter, or an experienced one. You will learn many new and important facts.Galen Higdon (MICHIGAN)"
5,packs well,"yep...it might not be the perfect tool for every cleaning, but it fits in my soft case and travels well on hunting trips. Does a fine job."
3,"great product, not the right size","This is an awesome product, however the 12g size is loose in my Benelli and Pardner barrels.I bought a 10g version to replace it and it works much better"
1,String pulled out,"Quite disappointed with the 12 gauge boresnake as the string pulled entirely out when pulling it through the barrel. It worked probably 20-25 times without a problem, then it just snapped."
3,Cheaper at WalMart,"I got this for $13.00 at WalMart. It works great and getting major crud out, but you still have to use the brush and rod to get a really lean shotgun. It's nice you can wash these and use them again. Just don't wash with anything nice.Great product not a great price.I recommend, but buy at Walmart for less.Vidimo Se!"
5,Does it's job well,There's not much to say about this one. It's very snug and makes a much quicker job of cleaning than a traditional rod (albeit not quite as thorough)
3,Disappointed overall . . .,"After buying my first sewing machine I wanted a book to teach me the basics. Unfortunately I found this book to be haphazardly organized, putting some techniques in the front of the book that I, as a beginner, was not ready to use or learn. Sidebars and diagrams can be helpful when used properly, but there were so many in this book that they were distracting. I found the section on how to organize your sewing space to be useful, but otherwise, I'm still looking for a good book on sewing basics. This isn't it."
1,Very disappointed with both style and substance,"This book is lousy! I am a brand new sewer, and I find the endless puns and jokes totally distracting and a huge interference with getting at the meat of the book. A few puns here and there would be fine, but the author spends WAY too much time being cute and clever, and it takes her forever to get to the point. Furthermore, the explanations (once you finally get to them) are not at all clear or helpful, at least not to this beginner. The diagrams are confusing, and the instructions on how to do various things are unclear.I have had this book for several months and have gotten NOTHING out of it. In fact, I am planning to bring it back to the bookstore where I got it to see if they will let me trade it for something else."
5,Great for Beginners,"Very thorough book for those of us who know absolutely nothing about sewing. The style is the traditional lighthearted Idiot's Guide format, making it a fun and easy, yet very informative, read."
1,Unclear...Very UNhelpful,"I'd have to agree with most of the negative reviews here. I have just acquired a sewing machine and am trying to teach myself to sew. I knew absolutely nothing about sewing and thought the idiot's guide would be for me. Most of the instructions are unclear, even the diagrams need help! I think better illustrations or pictures would help immensely. If you are a beginner like me, I would not recommend this book."
5,Knows Where of She Speaks,Lynn Bradley is a clear lucid narrator who knows where of she speaks. Get this book if you live with a manic depressive. Excellent reading. Very helpful and highly recommended.
1,...,This book is poorly written and confusing. There are at least 10 instances where theories are introduced with no explanation as if prior knowledge is assumed. There are acronyms used with NO explanation and the publisher makes the claim that if the book does not improve your grades they will refund your money. This is a LIE. I've tried believe me... Or you can try yourself. ...
5,Good beginning electronics book,"This is an excellent book for basic electronics. I have about a dozen books on basic electronics and this is probably the best written out of them. It is written for an individual with no electronics experience that wishes to learn on his or her own. It is not a textbook and does not go past basic theory, but it does cover the theory of operation of several appliances such as; Television, VCR?s, audio cassettes, Compact Disks and radio. It does have a small amount of math that is well explained."
1,Boring,I struggled to finish this book. I felt no sympathy or connection with any of the characters as none were brought successfully to life.
5,Enlightening,Branden's *brilliant* sentence-stem exercises allow you to explicate your own hidden knowledge and mature into an independent and efficient personality. I think I'm not alone in considering this to be an important work refining Objectivist ethics. If only follow through were as easy as the theory!
5,Excellent Information,This book has the ability to change the way you think and act. It will help you discover things about yourself that you may not have thought about and gives you an action to impove that area.
5,Very helpful self improvement book,"I bought this to understand myself more. It is one of the best book I have read. I highly recommend it to anyone who feels lost at times and need a good pick-me-up literature to read. It helped me see things from a different angle, which is all we really need sometimes."
5,"A lifetime of unsuccesful professional therapy, and then... ....this Book !!","There were always something missing in my life. I'm 32 now and i've never could've pointed the finger on anything that'd help. I've read 50-ish awesome books on personal developement the past year and almost mastered some of them like ""The 7 Habits"".So I kept building skills and conscience, but still wasn't able to trust in my inner talents.This book is the book I was looking for since the beggining, withouth knowing it. Now no matter how harsh my environment is, it's only my choice to accept what I want from life.Awesome !!"
3,Too wordy as other his books,"I found this book as well as other books of Nathaniel and his former ""teacher"" to be too wordy and unconclusive. While certain things are interesting and worth open discussion they can be described much easier and in more straight forward terms."
1,Warning!!!!,This review is for the audio edition. No stars is the true rating of a silly conversation with an old guy who cannot talk. The level of the meanings and ideas it is less than of a child in the first classes of elementary school. I feel very stupid i paid money for this garbage.
5,Mandatory Reading For Everyone,Powerful stuff. I like the abridged audio as well as the paperback. The 31 week exercises are productive. They can be found in the back of the paper book.
4,james,"Asa person suffering from manic depression, and withouta lot of self esteem, I found book fascinating , but not very resourseful,it was educational and informative. However for me it hasn't helped me any so far"
2,No Good,Not very good at all. Didn't find it all that interesting. Have read a lot better books on similar topics.
4,Great Colorful Puzzle for Adults,This is a very colorful and fun puzzle for adults! It had great colors and cute martini glasses!
1,poor quality,"Received item advertised as new. Very rickety parts, cheap construction, flimsey. Almost seemed as if item had been previously used for some time and was returned??? I returned item and purchased anotehr brand."
1,Didn't last a month,"The opener looks sturdy enough and performed well in opening the first 5 or 6 bottles of wine, but it broke in half last week after less than one month of use. Disappointing given the high rating this opener received from America's Test Kitchen."
1,NOT quality,"My husband gave this to me for a gift over a year ago, and like the other person, the lever snapped in two after about 8 months of use. It was used to open about 2 bottles of wine a week - not what I would call heavy use."
4,Great overview for those with small companies,"This book is a a quick read, it explains about 3/4 of the Act.After reading this you will be able to understand what the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was created to do, how the rules work, who is responsible for what in your company, and what you must do to comply with the act.Honesty, for the cost and the time it takes to read this book it is worth it."
5,Efficiciency yet simplicity,"This book is a very well written and structured piece that effectively educates the reader even though they might not be a business major. In other words, the reader extends through the thresholds of accounting experts and finance gurus, it conveys SOX in laymen terms for everyday people."
5,Advanced programming (for its time)... but good for historic purposes,"I've been a DOS user for decades (? - yeah, decades...), and I've always wondered ""How were those commands written?"" Doing my own small utility commands in assembly, I could never reach the level of ""code tightness"" that the DOS prompt displayed... ""Why is my COPY command 50K larger than their DOS COPY command?!?""This book showed me why... Ray Duncan's book must have been the DOS programming bible during its time. For those wanting to learn assembly, and the art of writing good programs, this is a definite buy - since DOS is nearly extinct, the price of the book will be minimal. If you're just starting with assembly, this will give you a reason to write ASM, with actual examples that work.DOS may be dead(?) but there are still lessons to be learned from its code."
5,"Short little book, but wonderful story","This book was recommended by a family member. I had no idea it was such a small book, but it is a very good tale. It shows that when you have only yourself to rely on, you can take care of yourself."
4,Definite must read!!,"What would you do if your tribe left you behind for dead?! Well this is true for the native elders Ch'idzigyaak and Sa'. The Alaskan chill has crept upon the People and they live on baron land, they have no choice but to leave behind those who are too helpless and old to carry on, and Ch'idzigyaak and Sa' are the unfortunate old women who have come to that fate. As family and friends leave them to freeze to death the women have a revelation...""If we're going to die, we're going to die trying!"" are the brave words Sa' speaks to her older friend. This book describes the struggles, bravery, and strength of these two old women, a legend from the Alaskan Athabascan tribe.Read this tale of tragedy and triumph today!"
5,An excellent piece of Americana!,"A very dear friend gave me ""Two Old Women"" to read and I have since recommended it to countless other people. This book is not a story of the past -- it is an ongoing tale of our circle of life -- one which belongs to all of us. For anyone who has known an older person or who will be one some day, this is a must read book. I congratulate Ms. Wallis on her work and encourage her to make it available in every museum gift shop for it is truly a work of art."
4,An inspirational story for anyone dealing with aging.,"This book is not for everyone. What makes it special is the main characters are not young and beautiful. The pace is agonisingly slow but necessary to describe the conditions in which these people live. As a health care professional, I plan to reccomend this book to my patients who are struggling with age and/or chronic illness."
1,Works better than Nyquil,"Whenever I have to be up early in the morning but can't seem to sleep, I pull out Two Old Women and I'm out like a light. The third-grade reading level along with the never-ending events of digging holes and setting traps to catch animals always gets the best of me. Want to fall asleep quick? Read Two Old Women. Want to take a step back in time to your second-grade English class? Read Two Old Women. Two Old Women: Just one page away from a great night's sleep."
1,Boring Book Capital of the World,"Talk about a page turner! This isn't one of those books. If you're looking for a super-sleeper, this is your book! Kevin, this book was really bad"
3,Two Old Women Gone Bad,"This book, which is extremely un-entertaining, and 'bad' as stated above, should not be recommended to anyone."
5,An absolutely wonderful book!,"This book was very well written. I know this because many of the contributing elders are family and friends of my family. This is more then a story, it was a way of life that was accurately described. One of the very best book I have ever read."
3,Never Complain Again,"Short, quick read. Wonderful story about survival and the value of elderly people. After reading this, you'll realize that you have too much unnecessary stuff."
4,I'll Never Forget This Book !,"I purchased this book at a church rummage sale underneath lots of books just thrown on top of one another. Am I ever glad I took a chance on reading this one.In elementary school we studied how the Eskimos dealt with their 'old ones' and tried to understand their culture. To our cozy lifestyle, it seemed horrible. Now that I am much older and have had glimpses into the lives and struggles of women whom I have admired, I see that we all must have courage or we perish while we still walk around.This is a powerful though very short book. I will recommend it to everyone who reads - especially my husband.I look forward to reading more of Ms. Wallis' writings."
3,"Quick read, simply written","This book was short and not profound, but was an interesting picture of the early Athabascan culture and contained a lesson for many of us."
5,"Two Old Women: An Alaska Legend of Betrayal, Courage and Survival",I enjoyed this book. I would recommend it to anyone. Young readers would enjoy it too. It's about two old women and survival in an area that seems to have very little to survive with. They were very innovative. As happens so often they were able to help their families in the end even though the young thought the elders had lost their usefulness.
4,Four Stars,"Two Old Ladies was a quick read. Written clearly with a window into the world of the Gwich'in people, Wallis includes genuine survival methods unique to the region. An excellent read, for younger and older audiences alike."
4,Love It,I had to read this book for school and now i cant stop reading it. Keep up the good work Velma!
4,Togman gets it right,"Unlike the vast majority of the work done in so called political science, Jeffrey Togman offers us an interesting account of the differences between immigration policy in America and France, without the ridiculous appeal to ""science."" The book is cogent, well-written, and concise."
2,Say It Again!,"Finstad's exhaustively researched book (average: one footnote per sentence!) is repetitious, repetitious, repetitious. Oh, and did I say she repeats herself? Beatty is a fascinating and complex subject. He deserves a cogent, readable, examination of his life and work. This isn't it.Further, Finstad's absorption in Freudian constructs to explain ALL behavior is facile and annoying. Does she mention that Beatty is a control freak and pleasure junkie because his father drank? Oh, yeah, just every page or so. Does she discuss the ""fact"" that Beatty did not want to achieve fame through the agency of his sister, Shirley MacLaine? About every other page, I'd imagine. Was Warren a ""Virginia gentleman"" conflicted by the temptations of Hollywood in conflict with his ""strict Baptist upbringing""? Yes, yes, a thousand times, yes.Ironically, Finstad acknowledges her ""editor."" Too bad no attention was paid to editing. Read it if you have a high tolerance for aggravation and little else to do."
4,Pretty jewelry box,"This is a very pretty jewelry box for a young girl. The fairies, flowers, ladybugs and butterflies on the outside are lovely - better than I expected. The sound of the music box is slightly tinny, but not bad, and the dancing fairy inside is pretty. It seems to be pretty well built - only time will tell."
3,good price/quality,Bought this as a gift for my 8 year old. It seems to be exactly as described. The quality is good for the price. My daughter loves it and it seems to have a fairly decent space for her to keep her jewelry and treasures in.
3,A little bit chintzy,"Bought 2 of these music boxes at once. Both played the melody off key. The dancer inside one box would not turn or play music unless you manually began turning it. Pretty, and nice for a child who is gentle."
5,Fairy Tale Jewelry Box,I purchased this jewelry box for my 5 year old niece for her b-day. It exceeded my exceptations.It has great music box with beautiful artwork and a spending fairy.It's cute and durable. She absolutely LOVED it! I'm going to buy several more for the other girls.
4,Special Gift,"I bought this for my little 5 yr old Grand-daughter and she loved it. Keeps her special things in her room. It is very cute. You do have to instruct them that you don't open it too many times, as I am not sure how long the little figurine will last. Fun while it does!"
5,A must have for a little girl!,"I purchased this for my 4 yr old. She loves it and listens to the music nonstop. It looks just like the one I had when I was younger. Also, for the price, if it does break, it's not a big deal. I plan on getting another one when my youngest is old enough."
5,Fairy Tale Jewelry Box,I got this jewelry box for my Grand daughter. She loves it. She really likes watching the Fairy dance around and the music and that she can put her jewelry in it.
4,Three-year-old loved it!,I purchased this jewelry box for our three-year-old granddaughter. She was delighted with the twirling fairy and loved winding it up and playing the music. It will be perfect for her to keep her small treasures inside. It is attractive and well made for the price. This ended up being a good choice for her. I did not recognize the melody that was being played but I'm sure she didn't care.
1,Broken,"I ordered this jewelry box for two neices, one is working great and the other never did. So frustrating, I will try sending it back but it doesn't help the christmas morning disapointment."
4,Cheap but good gift,"I got this along withBUTTERFLY Necklace Charm Pendant w/ Crystal Wings in Butterfly Velour Gift Box-Colors may varyas a gift for my 5 year old flower girl. It's just a plastic box with some paper coating, but she loved it and that's what counts. I recommend it for gifting, but with the expectation of it not lasting too long."
3,A Great Little Jewlery Box,"My 6 year old niece has been fascinated by ""music boxes"" since she was 3. She has gotten one on her birthday and for Christmas for the last several years. This fairy box was perfect for her. The fairy dancer and outside of the box are beautiful. A great buy."
4,Excellent live recording,Best live MMJ recording I've heard. Double disk of songs spanning their last several albums and a few rare tracks. Excellent playing and clean soundboard recording. Fans won't be disappointed.
2,Muddled,"Purchased on the strength of their Austin City Limits performance. While it has some of the same exuberance, the quality is poor and the sound becomes muddeld."
1,One of the worst albums I've ever heard,"I'll preface my comments by saying I've never heard anything they've recorded before. Based on some positive reviews, I gave it a listen. What a mistake. It was boring from start to finish. I'm at a total loss to understand what the appeal of their ""music"" is. There's nothing memorable about any of it (well that's not exactly true - I did hear the ""Hawaii Five-O"" theme recurring through one track [""Off The Record""]). I yawned several times while suffering TWO discs of this; I waited in vain for SOMETHING to like about this, but it was all for naught. I haven't been this bored by a live set since I caught Elbow several years ago in person."
2,Osho the Anachronist,"Osho has a fascinating mind and is a gifted speaker, but his views on the mind of women is positively embarrassing to listen to. Women only behave well when they behave intuitively? They do not respond to reason because they cannot understand reason? His jokes on the relations between men and women would be especially funny to a bunch of men sitting around a table in some smoke-filled bar. I wonder if Osho has ever read Hannah Arendt or Simone Weill?"
2,"Six rounds, I needed 5 round speed loaders","HKS Revolver Speedloader for S&W; 25-5/Taurus .45 Raging BullIt's a good product. But, they sent me the wrong ones. The Taurus comes in both 6 round and 5 round variants. I met a guy at the range who gave me the info on what he ordered. His were 5 round speed-loaders. They sent me 6 round speed-loaders. I note from another reviewer that this has happened before. Like the earlier reviewer, I now have to return them. There is not a contact the seller link on this products page. Too bad. I might have been able to get the right information the first time! Hey Amazon, you can certainly fix this!"
5,Works great for my S&W Governor,I bought 2 of these for my S&W Governor. I keep them loaded with .44 Colt hollow points. Definitely helps in reloading quickly!
2,sent wrong item,Its a good product if they would have sent the right ones they are supposed to be 5 shot loaders instead they sent 6 shot loaders which do no justice for a revolver that holds 5 rounds lol needless to say i have to send back ordred this same item 5 weeks ago and got 5 shot speeedloaders so i orderred 3 more and they send 6 shot loaders go figure
3,So awful it's hilarious....so many quotable lines!,"I cannot wait for this film to arrive on DVD. The previous reviewer pretty much summed it up - this movie contains the worst artistic and technical production this side of a Troma picture. The acting? Laughable. Music? Casio all the way. Editing is sloppy and a hack job. The script is a total joke from beginning to end, containing lines such as: ""Tyor! Even if you embrace the thought of killing him, you will become evil, and join him, and not kill him, GET IT?"" Others include: ""Hey - see you at 7:30"" (this in medieval times before clocks or time was even invented!). However on another level, this movie is GOLD. The fun lies in finding all of the flaws with the special effects and just enjoying the ride. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and well worth a rental to check it out."
1,Worse than Wizards of the Lost Kingdom,The first Wizards of the Lost Kingdom movie is bad. Wizards of the Lost Kingdom 2 is so bad that it makes the first one look like Academy Award material. The second Wizards of the Lost Kingdom is very depressing. The boy who plays the hero is totally miscast. Why did these movie makers make a sequel to Wizards of the Lost Kingdom. Is this a joke?
3,Not as tall as I thought,"I had read the reviews before I bought and didn't realize that everyone was talking about the doll and not the dog. So I was shocked to find the dog approximately 5 inches tall. Anyway, my bad, it is a cute little dog but I would not have paid so much for so little."
4,Entry - level Monk,"If you haven't heard of The Man, this one is a good way to start. Contains most of his celebrated compositions, though under CBS (the Prestige years are for me the best), with Charlie Rouse on tenor it' ll open your appetite for more. That is if you dig it!"
5,Wow!!,"James Ehnes, who I had never heard of previously, was the solo violinist when I went to the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. He was playing a piece from Bach's 3rd Symphony, I believe. My date and I were blown away by James. He was absolutely amazing, that's as close as I can get to describing. A few days later, I found a few of James' CDs and picked this particular album because it is Bach. It's wonderfully beautiful and still amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves the violin or Bach. If you love both, even better. If you get the chance to do so, see and hear James live. Truly truly...wow!"
4,OK for what it is,"My 2 & 1/2 year old loves stickers. So, I bought these for our recent 5 hour car trip and told her that they were re-usable stickers. They kept her entertained about 30 minutes each way. That was as much as I had hoped for. I have since put them away for another trip, but I am sure as she gets older and she understands more what they are, she will enjoy them more."
2,Colorforms not such a good buy.,"The colorforms just don't stick in place. I understand you can wash them, but who wants to do that constantly when you're busy with other things?"
5,"A Must-Have for Rock and Other Musicians -- and Other Music Lovers, Too!","Rock, popular, jazz and country music lovers in general -- and musicians who play those genres in particular -- will enjoy this in-depth look at the key instrument behind them all. Touching and revealing interviews with renowned guitarists are mixed with archival footage of guitar greats -- some well known, some obscure but influential nonetheless -- and with behind-the-scenes tours and histories of the Gibson, Fender and Rickenbacker manufacturing facilities. It's thorough, well-paced and well-organized and warrants repeated viewings."
5,This video rocks,"We watched the entire 155 minute main feature in one sitting and when it was over we couldn't believe it--I guess time flies when you're having fun! Lots of well-paced and interesting historical information and interviews-- our attention never wavered. Cool both for musicians as well as anyone who loves the best in guitar-oriented music from the 50's, 60's and 70's.Mike DoughtonThe Tower MarqueeSandy"
2,History?,Mediocre presentation at best. A DVD titled A History of the Electric Guitar should contain some timeline of history.
3,Video interesting but...,"I was looking for a DVD to show young children the history of the electric guitar. While the information presented is interesting, there are too many interviews. It was difficult for me to sit and watch the entire DVD. I had to break it up into several sittings. I'm not sure how this could have been made more interesting. Perhaps less dialogue and interviewing would work."
3,Easy to install; not sure about reliability,"I originally installed this unit in 2007 to power under-cabinet lighting in my kitchen. Installation was a breeze: connect the wires from the plug to the transformer, connect the wires from the lights to the transformer, plug it in and you're on your way.The unit died this summer and I ordered this model as a replacement. Again, installation took 15 minutes or less.I just hope that the transformer lasts longer than four years this time around."
5,it got my 10 year old reading again!,my 10 year old absolutely loved this book. she was not much of a reader and this book has turned her on to reading again. she didn't want to put it down and walked around the house reading it when ever she could. she loved it and has shared it with a lot of her friends who also enjoyed reading it.
4,Bathroom humor at it's finest,"My children (age 7 and 9) both read this book to themselves. They shared their laughter with the house however. I was also treated to passages read aloud. My son reads almost soley non-fiction science books. He doesn't read much fiction willingly, so I'm always on the look out for any that he will read. We've recommended this book to several children who like the Captain Underpants books, and they have all enjoyed it too. My son gives it 5 stars, but my more discriminating daughter gives it 4."
2,"great book, poor binding",My son loves this book. He enjoys this type of humor and it was well written. This book really grabbed him from page one. He can read well but is reluctant to read at times. I am finding that any type of potty humor grabs him and makes him want to read! This book and series makes an excellent choice for those who like that type of humor.The only issue I have with this book is the binding. It literally fell apart during his first reading. He is not heavy handed with the book and did not lay it down open . I can only hope the rest in the series are bound better.
3,It's only ok,"EXTREMELY light. I went through it in less than an hour. I reccomend it to 4th grade or less, although older kids can still enjoy it (I'm 13). There ARE a lot of butts in it-- bordering on rediculous. The extra stuff in the back is cute, though."
2,Not worth the money,"This book is not worth spending your money. Story line is poor, different ways of using the word butt is pretty much the entire content of the book."
5,Great book to keep 'em reading,"My ten year old son loves this book. Like the book says, if you're a woman or anybody over 18 you ain't gonna get-it."
5,"My Man, J.C. Heard ....","I just saw Mr. Heard profiled on a DVD based on Art Kane's famous 1958 jazz photo session.The same Mr. Heard whose son Eric was a classmate of mine in suburban Detroit, Eric also being the host for a number of poker games held at his residence.I met his dad but never realized he was this famous! Hey Eric, it's me Waff, I remember your dad to be a very cool dude; I can say the same now about his music.I bought this CD with pride and have been having a blast listening to it."
4,Great Fit but...,"This shoe is wonderful, except for one thing. The inside of the shoe is half soft suede and half shiny leather. The leather part is under the heal, and when walking, the leather heel sticks to the bottom of my foot, making a sticky flip flop noise. It requires powder on the heal to minimize the problem. Other than that, they are very comfortable."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","The whole concept of data-destorying concept is very good...it is necessary to use such a program to destory important data. This program, however, represents a poor execution. For exmaple, when ""zapping"" a hard drive to remove previously-deleted files, it removes only the data, not the file name. In addition, the user interface is dated and unprofessional."
2,Overpriced and not user friendly,"I would highly recommend searching for a different product before buying this one. I am glad I got mine used for five bucks or I would be even more disappointed. This product is NOT user friendly for the computer novice...talk about confusing! I read the directions SEVERAL times and still didn't feel confident that I was doing the right thing. The instructions are of little to no help. I guess if you are selling your computer and want to erase everything before you do, then maybe this is the product for you... but, if you just don't want a few old e-mails or pictures or whatever on your computer, buy something else. The processes on the disk also take forever and a day so if you have limited time, don't try this program!"
4,BANG BANG,"This is a very good cd. Two songs, Bang Bang and Rock America, are absolutely awesome. Other favorites are Feels Like Love, One Step From Paradise, and Turn It On. The lyrics and vocals are good throughout. They definitely know how to rock out, unlike some modern groups **COUGH COUGH Jonas Brothers COUGH COUGH**"
3,"""EASY"",GOOD,MELODIC POP METAL OF1989","FOR EVERY PERSON WHO LOVES HAIR/POP METAL OF THE 80s, THIS IS A REALLY GOOD CD TO GET INTO.STANDARD MELODIC RIFFS,GOOD ENOUGH VOCALS AS WELL AS DRUMS ALSO BUT NOTHING SPECIAL AT ALL.UNDER THE GUN IS THE BEST SONG OF THE ALBUM BUT THE REST OF THE ALBUM ALSO STANDS WELL...SO AINT A METAL ANTHEM BUT ITS OK!"
5,80's hair metal at its best!!,"I also missed this album when it came out in '89 but i was over a friends house a couple of weeks ago and when he put on ""Bang Bang,it reminded me of my teenage years in the 80's.After I left his house i went right to the music store and bought a copy.It's not a very hard album but its that kind of music that makes you feel good when you listen to it.I am a fan of the more harder stuff such as Megadeth,Ozzy,etc.But when I heard this I was blown away.My personal favorite tracks are ""Bang Bang"",""Naughty Naughty"",and ""Saturday Night"".Overall,its a CD that you won't put away for a while."
3,Danger Danger! Buy D2's Second Release First!,"This debut release from Danger Danger (D2) is good. It is more soft-sided and ballad-ish, but good. They're second release, Screw It! is just plain better than this one. They let their ""big hair"" down on Screw It! more than here.On this release, Naughty Naughty and Bang Bang (funny that these two songs ""echo"" the band's double moniker) are the best, and the rest are decent. Feels Like Love is pleasant and Rock America is good, too. Nothing on this release is hard - it's all pretty soft stuff."
1,"Oh my sweet lord, the cheese, the cheese...no.....","I wanted to like this when it came out, I really did. Big hair, songs about sex, 2 guitarists, etc. but it's just too cheesy, and the keyboards make it sound even more so. From ""Screw It!"" onward they became a much better band with a little more edge. My personal favorite is ""Cockroach"" but they're all quite good (with the exception of this release). Great band, bad album...hey it happens..."
2,Could've Been Better!,"Danger Danger was one of those bands from the '80s who could've been huge if they played their cards right. They never did join the ranks of Motley Crue, Poison or Ratt so obviously they didn't. Where did they fail? Where it counts. The songwriting.DD2 had the looks and talent to be a lot bigger than they were, they just didn't have the tunes. Naughty Naughty and Bang Bang (what is it with this band and ""twos""!) are highlights on this debut, but except for those two songs nothing else here sets Danger Danger apart from the vast group of ""Hair Bands"" from that era. And that's where the band failed. Unlike the above mentioned bands DD2 never found its own idenity, and ended up sounding exactly like many bands from the '80s. They could've done better!"
2,Disappointed,"In my opinion, Naughty Naughty is the only good song on this album. The style is really poppy and all the songs just seem stupid, I can't really stand to listen to it. Now ""Screw It!"" on the other hand is one of my all time favorite albums. I would pass this one up and go for ""Screw It!"", where every track is pure gold!"
1,Danger Danger - self-titled (Sony),"First CD of five titles this worthless fourth-rate glam metal band had bothered to put out.Cannot believe they lasted that long.I remember seeing these guys open for Alice Cooper on his 'Trash' tour.Talk about your suck-support acts.Simply love some of the song titles here,like their Mtv video ""Naughty Naughty"" and ""Bang Bang"".Like,how long did it take for them to think those up?Other hair bands I don't care for include Trixter,Warrant(after CD no.2)and Firehouse.Total waste of time,money and effort.I've heard some patrons compare this band to the likes of White Lion,Faster Pussycat or Poison.Don't you dare!Danger Danger doesn't EVEN come close.Avoid at all costs."
5,Rock America !!,"A perfect blend of melody, unforgettable songs, big riffs, guitar chops, in few words one of the best example of hair metal music ever recorded. Rock America!"
1,P.U!!!!!,"This SUCKED! I remembered liking a couple of the songs on this cd in high school, so I thought I'd add this CD to my collection, but its just awful. Don't waste your cash!!!!!!!"
1,not good,They are hard to place evenly.they get very annoying aftter a while.if removed they leave a glue mark.i recomend on not getting themi bought them and i have permanent glue marks on mine.
2,Great Idea Feels Great HOWEVER,I purchased two sets of these for my 360 controllers. They feel great and made a nice addition to the controller. I cleaned the controller handles with alcohol thoroughly to give the sticky side a clean surface to hold onto.What i found was that the gells started to move around and slide back and forth. The sticky side on the controller worked fine it was the sticky side to the gel that gave way and let the gell move and finally just come off leaving the handles sticky. I would not recommend these for this reason...if they can remedy this problem i would buy again..
4,"WOW !! GRITTY, INSPIRING, INTENSE and FUNNY","There's not a scintilla of self-pity in the overlooked, visceral MUDERBALL (Thinkfilm) where sweaty, profane, in-your-face quadriplegics play a violent variation of rugby on Mad Max style wheelchairs.Get to know the players and cheer their extreme determination to rise above their limitations to compete in the Paralympics in Athens. This inspiring, action-filled in your face documentary is a visceral testament to men who relish being alive and putting it on and over the line. I loved it."
2,ankle swelling solved by Jobst-replaced however by calf swelling,"Swelling is not a comfortable thing, but many of us work on our feet all day. Once I finally got these things ON, I couldn't wait to get them off! I measured for fit, so am certain I got the correct size. They did prevent my ankles from swelling, instead the swelling began above the top edge of the stocking! Very expensive lesson"
5,This film is a BLAST,"I saw this film when it played at the Palm Springs Intl. Film Festival (where it was a Best of the Fest selection). It is really fun and very entertaining. I'm not really even that into musicals but I love movies and Hollywood history so I checked it out. After I saw it I wanted to rent a ton of these movies by people like Busby Berkeley, Vincente Minnelli, Gene Kelly. Plus it reminded me about great stuff in the 70s like ""Fiddler on the Roof"" and ""Saturday Night Fever."" It even has clips from last year's ""Dreamgirls.""This documentary has long clips from all kinds of musicals, photos of the production of the movies, interviews with all kinds of stars and directors, I really liked it."
3,"Pretty good, but missing Astaire","Sorry, but this is not a five star product. It has many fine moments, but it races through the 1930's, and there is about thirty seconds or less of Fred Astaire dancing with Ginger Rogers. There are no scenes of Astaire in the 1940's, and only the number from Royal Wedding where he dances on the ceiling is shown from the 1950's. It is inexcusable to virtually ignore Astaire in the 30's and all of the 40's--his RKO musicals in the 1930's with Rogers saved the studio and were break throughs in the genre. There are plenty of good scenes and interviews, but almost ignoring Astaire brings my rating down, and deservedly so."
5,Hollywood singing and dancing,A wonderful overall history of music and dance in the movies. My only complaint would be it's too broad a subject to be covered in just 2 discs.I especially enjoyed the interviews.
5,Rock Slyde is sure to be a cult classic!!!,"Rock SlydeAfter watching this film, I am a bit bummed I missed it in the theaters. This movie was hilarious. Patrick Warburton is one of my favorite actors so I had to purchase the film. I laughed the entire film. Generally I don't like films with dry humor but this is one for the ages!"
4,Discovered Stargate Late,"I didn't watch any of the Stargate shows while they were on the air, but I started watching Stargate Atlantis on Amazon Prime and was immediately hooked. When I had completed all 5 seasons, I went back in time and started watching SG-1. The first season has been ok, and I can see the potential that spawned 10 seasons and 2 spin-offs, including Atlantis. I am nearing the end of season 1 of SG-1 and I am looking forward to watching the series develop into the excellent precursor to Atlantis."
5,Love Sg1,I had forgotten just how much I love this show! Season one is really good! I would recommend this any day!
3,extemely abridged version,"the actual book has 26 stories, the ""audiobook"" only has about 6 WTF! How about a little more info in the description. Also the sound quality is little more than a cassette tape ran through some filters. ""1"" 54 min track. J. J. Reneaux is great, its just the sparse content and shoddy sound quality I have a beef with. Thought i was getting all 26 stories, Was this audiobook even finished?"
4,I grew up with a lot of these stories,Brought back many good memories of my childhood. Excellent read for both Cajuns and nonCajuns. Miss the good old days.
4,Excellent renditions,"Whether you're an Ennio Morricone fan or not, this is just plain excellent music. The pianist, Enrico Pieranunzi, who played on many of the original Morricone recordings, is the arranger and band leader on this album. The pieces he chooses to cover are surprising--not always the main themes from the selected films; occasionally they're obscure tracks on already obscure Morricone albums. The result, though, is a beautiful collection of tunes that is very listenable.Joey Baron is one of the best jazz drummers working today. Marc Johnson also has a reputation as a world-class jazz basist, composer and band leader. Morricone himself writes an endorsement of these recordings in the booklet, and he is pictured with the band."
5,Fan of Yuguoh,Spend some time mastering the strategies of the deck and you will beat any other player
4,Good shirts,"Bought for my Father for Christmas. It's what he wears and a color that he wears. Good quality, turns out he has more of the same in different colors."
5,pocket polo shirt,"Shirt fits well and I like the fact it has a pocket! it's the right color for my job, and the price was right"
2,"Don't buy if you want a ""real"" polo type shirt","I bought these shirts for my husband to wear to work based on the reviews. However, we were extremely disappointed with them and the shirts were immediately returned. My husband works in a chemical plant where khakis and polos are the normal attire. He specifically wanted some polos with a pocket which we couldn't find locally. These were extremely thin and just felt cheap - nothing like a real polo."
4,Great find!,"Bought two of these polo shirts as a gift, the style with the pocket can be hard to find. They were just right for the recipient."
2,flimsy and thin,I didn't like the flimsiness of this shirt but you get what you pay for and I'm using it to wear when I work around the house so no big deal.
3,Nice shirt,The quality and durability is such that I would not hesitate to buy another of the same brand of merchandise.
1,doesn't get cold,"I am extremely disappointed with the product. It does not get cold at all. Even when kept in the freezer overnight, it doesn't get colder than a dry towel."
3,Not the OLD Bed Buddy!!,"The bed buddy has changed!! They've stitched a line down the middle so as to create a kind of ""dual pipeline"" effect. This ruins everything!! I spent a half-hour removing the stiching, and now it's just like my old Buddy and working great (*****). I disagree with the review that states that they've removed some stuffing -- once you remove the stiching, it's just like the old one. Dear Carex: get rid of the stiching!!! Also, FYI, I massage peppermint oil onto my neck between Bed-Buddy sessions, and over the months the stuffing has absorbed some of the oil - it's a little groaty, but it stays hot twice as long!!"
5,Love it as hot pack,"I haven't tried it as a cold pack, but I love it as a hot pack. It was great for when I had trouble breastfeeding my daughter. I also used it a lot for back problems. It is the perfect shape for these uses. I would just wrap it around my neck...even in the car!"
1,Carex Bed Buddy,I have a Bed Buddy I purchased at a mall 5 years ago & really liked it for back pain. But thought it was time for a new one & when I saw the Carex Bed Buddy on Amazon I ordered it. I do not like it because it doesn't heat up like my old one; even when you put the extra time on it as the directions suggest. So have returned it.
4,Great product.,These Bed Buddies come in handy all the time for a variety of ailments. Could only find them online and the price was right. Really love them.
2,Does not get hot enough for a decent hot compress,"Nuked it for up to 2 mins, the max allowed as noted in the box. It didn't get very warm. It was very comfortably warm so if if for some reason you need a very low heat hot compress, this will probably work. But why not just buy one that gets really hot if you need it to be hot, then just nuke for just a few seconds to get a comfy warm compress?Anyway, i returned this to the store. Went to dollar store to get a bAg of rice, Put rice inside an old tube sock, knotted it in the end, viola! I got my cheap hot compress, that gets really hot for my need.2 stars for the design though. It was comfy and was easy to maneuver to apply on my arm and lower back."
2,This is sewn in the middle---not as good as original,"I love the original Carex Bed Buddy Hot/Cold Packs. I looked at the picture and it looked like the ones I always get, so I ordered three. I got the BB and was I disappointed. It is sewn in the middle and it makes it stiffer and I don't feel the heat like the others. It's not what I like in my BB. I should have contacted Amazon b/c I could have returned the other two (Amazon is great with that) but I didn't so I am stuck with them. I love the ones withOUT the seam down the middle of it."
2,SMELLS SO BAD!,"It does what it says. But the SMELL IS AWFUL! Ugh, I wish I would have known, I can't stand having it near me. It smells like burning rubber or something. Yuck."
2,Hot and Cold pack...think again,I'm sure if I was using this for heat it would be pretty good. I stuck it in the freezer overnight and the coldness only lasted 30 minutes max. Disappointed and will be using the blue ice packs that are for lunches for my migraines.
5,The Original Bed Buddy Hot & Cold Pack,"The Original Bed Buddy Hot & Cold Pack product is unique in that it produces moist heat not a dry heat like the rest, that deeply penetrates the tissue .It is very effective and fast in terms of producing temporary relief of aches and pains.The other benefit of the moist heat includes increased blood flow that can relieve inflamed joints and help maintain flexibility especially for those who suffer from arthritic and rheumatic pain."
3,Skimping on Quality,"I've used the Bed Buddy for years and have liked it. When I recently replaced my old one, I was not satisfied with the changes. The Bed Buddy is shorter! And they have divided it into compartments to keep the filling from shifting. The result is a stiffer less flexible product. I much prefer the earlier longer models without the compartments. The shorter length is a disadvantage. However, the Bed Buddy still delivers muscle soothing heat."
